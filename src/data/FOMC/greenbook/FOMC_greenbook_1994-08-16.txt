DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent indicators have provided mixed signs on the current pace
of economic expansion. It is fairly clear that hiring has continued
at a good clip into the summer months, but, owing to a leveling of
the workweek, aggregate hours in July were only modestly above the
second-quarter average. Although there are no signs of a
troublesome overhang of stocks in the wake of the spring surge in
inventory investment, that rate of accumulation is not likely to be
sustained. Among final sales categories, housing activity is
showing the effects of higher interest rates: consumer demand
appears to be firm, with spending probably damped a bit recently by
the limited availability of desired motor vehicles; and indicators
of business fixed investment remain strongly positive. On balance.
the picture suggests that GDP growth probably has slowed somewhat
from the average pace of the first half, but not enough to relieve
pressures on productive resources. Meanwhile, there has been no
significant change in the trends of labor costs and of prices of
finished goods and services--despite a continued rise in the prices
of industrial materials.
Employment and Unemployment
In July, nonfarm payroll employment rose about 260,000, a pace
not appreciably different from the average for the first six months
of the year. Although average weekly hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers were essentially flat in July, the gain in
employment was enough to push production worker hours up to a level
0.4 percent above the second-quarter average. The unemployment rate
in July backed up 0.1 percentage point to 6.1 percent.
Increases in payroll jobs were widespread in July. Employment
in the services industry posted a large gain, owing in part to
another sizable increase in hiring at personnel supply agencies.

Retail trade employment grew 75,000, reflecting gains at eating and
drinking establishments as well as general merchandise and food
stores. In the construction industry, employment rose another
25,000 in July--a surprisingly large gain in light of the recent
trends in homebuilding activity. Manufacturing employment rose
6,000 in July; however, strike activity by the United Auto Workers
(UAW) at Caterpillar and General Dynamics reduced manufacturing
payrolls by 12,000 workers. The average workweek in manufacturing
edged down in July; nevertheless, at 41.9 hours, it remains very
high by the standards of recent years.
The latest strikes in manufacturing underscore the more
aggressive posture of organized labor this year. From January to
June of this year, 24 strikes involving 1,000 or more workers
occurred. Should strikes continue to occur at this rate, 1994 would
register the largest number of work stoppages since 1989.
Nevertheless, strike activity this year remains low in comparison
with the 1970s, when strikes totaled at least 200 or more each year.

shut down all of its plants in early July for summer vacation.
Although most workers received paid time off for a regular workweek,

considerably short of that in payroll employment. The number of
unemployed workers rose 188,000 in July, mostly reflecting more
individuals on temporary layoff and a larger number of unemployed
new entrants into the labor force. Meanwhile, the labor force moved
higher in July, nudging the participation rate up to 66.3 percent--a
level still well below the January reading of 66.7 percent.
As with employment, the weakness in the participation rate this
year may reflect sampling error or start-up problems with the new
CPS. However, even when viewed over a longer time span, labor force
participation in recent years has lagged earlier trends. In
particular, the flatness in participation since 1990 contrasts
sharply with the increases recorded during the mid- to late 1980s
when a significant number of youths and women were pulled into a
booming labor market.
Even before the recession began to discourage participation,
the rates for younger workers had begun to decline, in part, it
appears, because they were opting for school. During the recession
and slow recovery, participation remained weak, not only among young
workers but also adults. But even as the economy has strengthened,
the participation rate has not picked up. In part, the recent lack
of entry may reflect a continuing perception that job opportunities
are scarce. But, more fundamental changes in labor force growth
appear to be involved. With the gap between female and male
participation rates having narrowed dramatically over the past
twenty years, the scope for sizable further contributions from
rising participation rates of women probably has diminished.
2. Over the six months ending in July 1994, employment growth in
the payroll survey exceeded that in the household survey by almost
1.4 million--large, but not unprecedented in the history of the
series. BLS has indicated some discomfort with the recent
divergence in these series and has cautioned users to discount the
household survey data because of the uncertainties associated with
the introduction of the new CPS.

Although some further gains are anticipated in aggregate
participation, the underlying uptrend is likely to fall short of the
rapid rate of increase seen over the previous two decades.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance were 327,000 during
the week ended August 6. With the exception of a brief run-up in
early July, weekly filings of initial claims in recent weeks have
moved below the 350,000 average evident between March and June of
this year.
In the second quarter, output per hour in the nonfarm business
sector is estimated to have fallen at an annual rate of 1.2 percent.
Although nonfarm output rose 4.1 percent in the second quarter,
hours worked jumped 5.4 percent at an annual rate. Nonetheless,
over the four quarters ended in 1994:Q2, labor productivity rose
2.6 percent--a gain well above our estimate of 1.4 percent annual
trend growth.
In the first quarter, labor productivity growth was revised up
more than 1-1/2 percentage points to 2.9 percent (annual rate).
However, revisions to labor productivity in earlier years were
small, and left productivity only a little above its previous level
(chart).
Industrial Production
Data on hours of production workers and measures of physical
product suggest that industrial production advanced moderately in
July, after rising 1/2 percent in June. A decline in electricity
generation from its unusually high June level is expected to reduce
the July gain by about 0.1 percentage point. Production in
manufacturing rose fairly strongly, and the rate of factory capacity
utilization probably remained near 83 percent. Utilization rates in

primary processing industries, such as textiles, lumber, and iron

Assembly schedules for the third quarter indicate little change
in car and truck output. In July, auto production was close to
schedules, and truck production actually exceeded plans. As in
July, car assemblies in August are expected to be held down by
extended model changeovers at some plants. Truck schedules call
for production to increase in August as additional capacity comes on
line.

The available evidence suggests that output of appliances and
other household durables was robust in July. Meanwhile, declines in
output of gasoline and residential electricity held down growth in
production of consumer nondurables. The fallback in residential
electricity came on the heels of a double-digit gain in June and

motor vehicle output in the second quarter by roughly 0.2 million to
0.3 million units (annual rate) and are likely to reduce the level
of motor vehicle output in the third quarter by a similar amount.
The lost production is expected to be made up only gradually in
coming quarters.

reflected more moderate temperatures, which reduced air conditioning
demands.
Recent data also indicate that output of business equipment and
related parts (excluding motor vehicles) advanced quite strongly in
July, despite the ongoing weakness in aircraft and defense equipment
and the strike at Caterpillar. Production worker hours for
business equipment excluding motor vehicles increased moderately
last month, and the implied gains in production are consistent with
the uptrend in orders for information processing, industrial, and
other equipment.
Production of construction supplies looks to have changed
little for a second month in July, and growth in output of
industrial materials, which was rapid through March, has slowed
because of declines in the production of parts used to make
vehicles. Output of energy materials declined in July, and raw
steel production fell because of repairs to equipment at several
plants. Elsewhere, a rebound in paper and paperboard and continued
growth in equipment parts contributed to a small overall gain in
production of industrial materials.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles fell to an average of a little over
14 million units (annual rate) in June and July, with declines in
purchases of both cars and trucks. Nearly all of this decline in
sales from the robust pace of the first quarter has occurred among
vehicles produced by the Big Three.
5. The strike at Caterpillar began on June 22. Sources at
Caterpillar report that plants are currently operating with a
workforce that is at 75 percent of its pre-strike level. About
25 percent of the regular hourly employees have returned, and been
joined by roughly 13.500 white-collar workers, re-hired workers,
contract employees, and newly hired permanent employees. This
information suggests that the level of July production at
Caterpillar was roughly one-half of the normal nonstrike level.

Two special factors have contributed to the decline in light
motor vehicle sales since the first quarter. First, more than half
of the drop in car sales in the second quarter reflected lower
levels of fleet sales (chart, upper left panel). The swing in
rental car purchases was concentrated in sales of mid-sized and
large vehicles, which represent a larger share of fleet purchases
than of overall sales. Second, short supplies of several models of
cars and trucks have held down sales. Inventories of some domestic
models of small and mid-sized cars have been extremely lean owing to
the extended model changeovers, and sales of these vehicles have
fallen appreciably (upper right panel). Among light trucks, sales

represented a catch-up in sales delayed from the second half of last
year because of supply shortages. The information on fleet and
retail sales from Ford and General Motors is confidential.

have been limited by short supplies of sport utility vehicles (lower
left panel), where production has run into capacity constraints at
either assembly or parts plants, and inventories have become very
tight (lower right panel).
In addition, the highly favorable market fundamentals that
boosted demand earlier this year have ebbed a bit. Prices have
increased further, and the average interest rate at auto finance
companies was 10 percent in June, 2-1/2 percentage points higher
than its recent low in January. The latest readings on car buying
attitudes from the Michigan SRC survey were little changed in early
August at a level somewhat below the high readings seen earlier this
7year.
Personal Income and Consumption
The latest spending data show that nominal retail sales were
flat in July. Nominal sales in the retail control category
increased only 0.3 percent; however, the previously slight gains in
May and June were revised upward to 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent,
respectively. Sales at general merchandise and furniture and
appliance stores increased further, while purchases at apparel
stores were off in July after large June increases. In combination
with today's CPI report, the retail sales data suggest that real
consumption of goods excluding motor vehicles in July was
0.4 percent above the second-quarter average. The upward revisions
to retail sales also imply second-quarter growth in real PCE of
nearly 2 percent, about 3/4 percentage point above the initial BEA
estimate.
The biggest contributor to the recent volatility in PCE growth
has been spending on durable goods, which jumped 8-3/4 percent at an
7. In recent months, fewer households have been reporting that it
is a good time to buy a car because of low interest rates or low
prices, and more respondents have been saying that it is a good time
to buy because prices will rise in the future.

annual rate in the first quarter, and then slowed substantially in
the second quarter. A temporary surge in consumer purchases of
motor vehicles in the first quarter more than accounted for the
swing: transactions in used cars, in particular, were boosted by
unusually large sales from rental car companies.
Spending on nondurable goods and services has also grown more
slowly than in the first quarter. In part, this pattern reflects
temporary first-quarter strength in spending on personal business
services--pushed up by increased securities trading--and energy
services, which were boosted by severe winter weather. The most
recent data show that services spending increased 0.5 percent in
June; about two-thirds of this gain was attributable to increased
outlays for electricity during the June heat wave.
During the past year or so, the pace of consumption growth has
roughly matched that of disposable income adjusted for the effects
of the California earthquake and other special factors (top and
middle panels). This pattern has produced a fairly flat adjusted
saving rate for this period (bottom panel). The recent
stability of the saving rate contrasts with the decline that
occurred between early 1992 and mid-1993.
Some analysts have suggested that the weakness in spending in
the second quarter is an important signal that household debt
burdens have again become too high and consumers are beginning to
retrench. The evidence is mixed: While the ratio of debt service
payments to income has stopped declining, it has not as yet shown a
significant increase (top panel). Although the ratio of debt to

adjustments for uninsured losses to residential and business
properties that occurred during the Northridge earthquake and
hurricanes Andrew, Iniki, and Hugo. The series also transfer some
bonuses paid in the fourth quarter of 1992 for tax reasons to the
first quarter of 1993, which is when they normally would have been
paid. BEA has made no adjustment for bonus-shifting between 1993
and 1994.

income has edged up recently (middle panel), some of the recent debt
growth occurred because of increased transactions use of credit
cards, stimulated in part by incentives such as frequent flyer miles
or rebates.
Historically, movements in consumption spending have been more
closely related to consumer confidence than to debt burdens,
probably because perceptions about current and future economic
conditions are a key factor in determining whether a given debt
burden is acceptable or worrisome. The preliminary results from the
Michigan survey indicate that confidence improved in early August,
raising the level of the index back close to its recent peak. Gains
were evident in consumers' assessments of both current and expected
conditions. The Conference Board index edged off in July but
remained near its highest reading in four years.
Housing Markets
Housing markets have continued to weaken in response to the
higher level of mortgage interest rates, with activity slowing
further in June. Total private housing starts fell 9.8 percent in
June, to 1.35 million units at an annual rate.
In the single-family sector, housing starts declined to
1.16 million units in June, while sales of new single-family homes
fell to 591,000 units at an annual rate, the lowest level in two
9
years. The latest data leave single-family starts and permits
unusually high in relation to sales, suggesting--as do other
indicators--that the June estimate of sales may understate the
actual level. The number of new homes for sale rose in June to
317,000 units, the highest level since late 1990, though not an
unusually high level historically. The declines in new home sales
and in single-family starts were accompanied by a small drop in
9. The sales estimates for April and May also were revised down
considerably.

existing home sales in June (but most such sales are reported at
closing and thus lag the other series). Further, although
consumers' homebuying attitudes, home builders' assessments of new
home sales, and mortgage applications for purchasing a home all
edged up in early August, they remained well below the favorable
readings at the beginning of the year (chart).
In the multifamily sector, starts fell more than 100,000 units
(annual rate) in June, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the
decline in total housing starts. Averaging through the monthly
fluctuations, multifamily starts jumped 25 percent in the second
quarter. An increase in multifamily activity is consistent with
anecdotal reports of demand pressures for multifamily housing and
rising rents in various localities, but some of the recent pickup
may also reflect construction postponed during the first quarter.
Furthermore, market conditions for the nation as a whole do not
appear to favor sustained rapid growth in this sector. Vacancy
rates for apartments have been stuck at about the same level over
the past year, and they remain high by historical standards (chart).
Also, increases in residential rent have been persistently low
relative to the non-housing components of the consumer price index
(chart).
Recent press reports have suggested that reduced availability
of homeowners' insurance may adversely affect home sales in
California, which accounts for roughly 7 percent of single-family
construction activity nationwide. Under California law, companies
that write homeowners' insurance are required to offer earthquake
coverage. But, with losses mounting, many firms have stopped
selling new homeowner policies. (In most cases, renewals of
existing policies have not been affected.) Because lenders are
increasingly requiring earthquake coverage as a condition for a

loan, difficulties in obtaining homeowners' policies could hamper
home sales. According to information obtained from the staff of
Governor Wilson and from the California Association of Realtors, few
if any closings have fallen through at this point, but some
settlements have been delayed. A state-run program that offers
minimal fire and earthquake coverage may provide an alternative to
private coverage.
For some time, home builders have been citing price increases
for some materials and shortages of skilled construction labor as
factors that have begun to exert upward pressure on home prices.
Lumber prices have stabilized somewhat at a fairly high level, and
the prices of many other building materials--including plywood,
gypsum products, concrete products, and insulation--have continued
to move upward (chart).
Employment of production or nonsupervisory workers in
construction has risen moderately over the past couple of years for
residential contractors and more noticeably for skilled workers in
special trades (chart).10 However, employment at operative
builders, who construct homes for sale, has only edged up. Data on
average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers in
residential construction indicate that hourly wage increases
generally have been modest in recent months. Although AHE for total
construction jumped 0.8 percent in July, data are not yet available
separately for the residential and nonresidential sectors.
The employment cost index provides more comprehensive data on
the construction industry. ECI hourly compensation in construction,
which includes residential, nonresidential, and public building,
rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent over the March to June period,
following a 7 percent increase in the first quarter. Unpublished

data from the BLS indicate that rising wages and benefits of
professional and managerial personnel have fueled most of the recent
pickup in overall construction compensation growth.11
Although trade reports from some areas have mentioned rising
home prices as a partial explanation for lower sales in June,
increases in national measures of home prices remained moderate in
the second quarter. The constant-quality new home price index,
which adjusts for compositional changes in house quality and
geographic location, rose 3.0 percent from the level a year earlier,
with no clear trend in the rate of increase in recent quarters. The
constant-quality index of existing home prices (compiled jointly by
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from repeat sales of individual
properties) increased 3.7 percent during the same period; the rate
of increase in this index has been on a gradual uptrend since early
1993.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment advanced at an annual rate of
10 percent in the second quarter, roughly the same pace as in the
first quarter, but down from the 16 percent growth rate registered
in 1993. Outlays in the second quarter were boosted by a strong
recovery in real nonresidential construction. Investment in
producers' durable equipment--which advanced at an annual rate of
21 percent in 1993--rose less than 8 percent in the second quarter.
A marked slowing in the growth rate of real outlays for office
and computing equipment accounted for much of the deceleration in
PDE. After soaring nearly 60 percent in 1993, real computer
purchases have advanced at only about one-quarter that pace so far
this year. While growth in nominal expenditures has tailed off a
bit, the deceleration in real expenditures has been intensified by a

slowing of the rate of decline in BEA's computer deflator. This
deflator decreased only 3-3/4 percent at an annual rate in the
second quarter, after falling at an annual rate of about 15 percent
over the 1992-93 period.
Price measurement problems may have exaggerated the extent of
the estimated slowdown in real computer purchases during the first
half of this year. Industry sources do not believe that prices are
firming, and a small sample of mail-order PC vendor prices collected
by Board staff provides some evidence to this effect. Although the
sample does not cover the full range of equipment in the computer
deflator, the models included are in what currently is one of the
hottest segments of the market, and they still are posting
significant price declines (chart). The biggest drops apply to the
newest models, which may be underrepresented in the computer
deflator.12 Had the computer deflator fallen at the 1992-93 pace,
office and computing investment would have grown at an annual rate
of close to 25 percent in the second quarter--adding
3-1/2 percentage points to growth in real PDE.
Most other components of PDE have continued to show solid
gains. PDE excluding aircraft, computers, and motor vehicles
advanced 17 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter; for the
first six months of 1994. spending in this category rose at roughly
last year's pace. Real investment in communications equipment
jumped at an annual rate of 34 percent in the second quarter, and
special industrial equipment--a category that includes woodworking,
textile, paper industry, food product, and printing machinery--
advanced 17 percent. The only major categories of PDE that did not

revised down substantially for 1992 and 1993. The revision
reflected new information collected by the Census Bureau on the
composition of computer purchases, with a higher weight given to
personal computers in the revised numbers.

show solid growth were aircraft and motor vehicles. Business
purchases of aircraft declined sharply in the second quarter.3
Motor vehicle purchases were off 17 percent, as fleet sales dropped
from their high first-quarter level, and heavy truck sales flattened
out because of capacity constraints.
Most leading indicators of investment activity point to further
large gains in PDE in coming months. Orders for nondefense capital
goods surged in June, continuing a strong uptrend. Bookings have
been solid for most types of equipment, and the stock of unfilled
orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft and
computers) has risen sharply in recent months. In addition, heavy-
truck manufacturers report large order backlogs, and planned
capacity expansions should begin to come online in the early fall.
Unfilled orders for computers also have surged, and industry sources
are reporting that some major manufacturers are accumulating large
inventories in anticipation of another sharp jump in sales later
this year.
Real investment in nonresidential structures climbed 18 percent
at an annual rate in the second quarter, more than offsetting the
large weather-related decline in the first quarter.14 Outlays
advanced at double-digit rates in virtually every category, with the
largest gains occurring in the industrial and commercial sectors.
13. Because growth in aircraft spending has been depressed for
some time, this category is no longer a major component of PDE.
In the second quarter, aircraft represented less than 1 percent of
PDE; this share is well below the shares in excess of 7 percent
seen at times during the boom years of the late 1960s.
14. The June data on construction put-in-place for nonresidential
structures were close to BEA's assumptions in the advance estimate
of GDP and do not suggest any significant revision to real
investment in the second quarter.

The second-quarter jump in construction returned that series to last
year's slightly positive trend.15
A recent spurt in permit issuance suggests that the modest
recovery in nonresidential construction may well continue into the
second half of the year. Permits for private nonresidential
structures increased 1.5 percent in June and were up 10 percent for
the second quarter as a whole. Permits for industrial and
commercial buildings have picked up, while institutional permits
have continued their recent downtrend.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
Business inventory investment slowed in June after a sharp
acceleration in April and May. Excluding auto dealers, stocks in
manufacturing and trade rose in June at a $29 billion annual rate in
current-cost terms, as compared with the average $80 billion April-
May pace.16 Despite this surge last quarter, stocks do not appear
excessive at this point. The bulk of the runup was in retail and
wholesale trade inventories, but given the high level of demand,
stock-sales ratios in these sectors remained within their recent
ranges. And in manufacturing, stockbuilding appears to have been
the planned response to rising demand.
Recent buildups in manufacturing stocks have been concentrated
in just a few industries. Particularly noteworthy is the machinery
industry, where stocks have been trending upward over the past year.
Orders have been strong for many types of industrial machines and
electrical and electronic equipment, and the inventory investment in
15. Growth in nonresidential structures investment was revised
down for 1991, 1992, and 1993 in the latest annual NIPA revision,
with reductions in estimated spending on industrial buildings,
utilities, and drilling and mining.
16. For the second quarter, the current-cost inventory
accumulation for all manufacturing and trade excluding motor
vehicles is now shown to have been $57 billion based on Census data,
about $4 billion more than BEA's assumption in the advance GDP
report.

this area appears to have been intended. Recent Census data show
that increases in manufacturers' bookings became more widespread in
June; orders for many types of nondefense capital goods--
construction and materials handling equipment, metalworking
machinery, and equipment for the telecommunications, rail and marine
transportation industries--increased substantially. By stage of
processing, inventories of materials and supplies and work in
process grew last quarter, but stocks of finished goods edged down.
This pattern also suggests that the accumulation of factory stocks
was largely intended.
In the trade sector, the sharp accumulations in April and May
followed sizable drawdowns in March and generally modest buildups
over the first quarter as a whole. In June, inventories were
reduced at some trade establishments and expanded much more slowly
at others. The accumulation of wholesale inventories in the second
quarter was largely in durable goods--motor vehicles, machinery,
electrical goods, and professional and commercial equipment. By and
large, this pattern of stockbuilding mirrors that observed for
manufacturers and is generally in line with the brisk pace of
business fixed investment in recent months. In contrast, retail
inventory buildups outside of automotive dealers in May and June
were concentrated in nondurable goods, especially in stocks of
general merchandise. Sales at general merchandise stores rebounded
in June, and inventories were up considerably. The inventory-sales
ratio for general merchandise stores at the end of June was still
below its recent high posted in November of last year.
Federal Sector
Real federal government purchases declined at a 4.8 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, with drops in both defense and
nondefense purchases. Much of the relatively steep 6.9 percent

decline in real nondefense spending stemmed from the government's
employee buyout program, which reduced the nondefense workforce by
roughly 17.000 people.17 The accompanying transitory boost in
nominal compensation led to an increase in the nondefense
compensation deflator in the second quarter, as did the additional
paid leave given to the federal work force for the day of mourning
for former President Nixon.18
The unified budget deficit for the fiscal year through June was
$150 billion, 25 percent below the corresponding figure for fiscal
year 1993. The reduction in the deficit reflects continuing
strength in all categories of receipts, as well as restraint in the
growth of outlays.
The final data on June tax collections showed a $9.5 billion
increase over this same period last year. Corporate estimated tax
payments were particularly high, rising 17 percent above last year's
level, primarily because of continued growth in profits. Withheld
personal income and social insurance taxes in June were
5-1/2 percent above their level of a year ago; the gain roughly
matches the increase in wages and salaries over the past four
quarters. Nonwithheld personal taxes were up only 3-1/2 percent
from the June 1993 level, but these data are difficult to interpret
because of the variability in the timing of nonwithheld payments and
19the changes in tax rates and safe harbor provisions.
17. Real federal government purchases in the first quarter also
were revised down sharply; most of the revision was in nondefense
purchases.
18. The effect of these factors is only temporary, and in the
third quarter the nondefense compensation deflator is expected to
retrace its run-up.
19. OBRA-93 changed the safe harbor provisions such that taxpayers
whose income increased by more than $40,000 over the previous year
could avoid interest or penalty charges by paying 110 percent of
that year's tax liability. Previously, these taxpayers were
required to pay 90 percent of current year tax liability in withheld
or estimated payments.

Federal outlays excluding deposit insurance so far this year
are 1.2 percent higher than outlays over the same period last year.
Outlays during June were 1.8 percent higher than outlays during June
1993; spending in the defense and income security categories was
lower, while spending in other categories was higher. The reduction
in income security expenditures reflected decreased spending on
unemployment benefits, through both lower unemployment and the
expiration of emergency unemployment benefits. Medicare and health
spending was up 8 percent over the June 1993 level.
In the Mid-Session Review of the 1995 Budget, OMB projected
deficits of $220 billion for 1994 and $167 billion for 1995.
Thereafter, the deficit is projected to increase gradually through
the end of the decade. The economic assumptions underlying these
projections are little different from those used in January, except
for higher projected interest rates. CBO has not yet released its
summer update of the economic and budget outlook, but press reports
indicate that their deficit forecast for 1994 will be close to
$200 billion, $20 billion below the Administration's forecast. Most
of the difference probably stems from projected outlays; OMB's
forecast looks high compared with the nine months of data that we
have for fiscal 1994.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases by state and local governments rose at a
2.0 percent annual rate in the second quarter, following a
1.4 percent decline in the first quarter. The second-quarter gain
was widespread across goods and services. Real construction
spending rose at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
reversing only a little of its sharp first-quarter decline.20
20. The June data on construction put-in-place suggest an upward
revision to real construction expenditures of $1 billion, which
would raise the growth rate in this category to 6-1/2 percent
(annual rate).

II-44
The BEA's annual revision has significantly reduced the deficit
on operating and capital accounts, excluding social insurance funds
21(chart). Most of the revision stems from lower estimates of
goods and services. Other factors contributing to the revision
include lower estimated transfer payments (mostly for Medicaid), and
greater personal nontax collections. In addition to being smaller
than previously estimated, the state and local deficit on operating
and capital accounts now appears to have improved slightly since
1991. Nevertheless, the sector has a long way to go before it can
see a surplus.
Although the condition of state general fund budgets--largely
operating accounts that represent about half of state spending--
appears to have improved during the past year, recent developments
for cities have been less positive. Survey data from the National
League of Cities show that the share of cities expecting deficits in
their general fund accounts increased in fiscal 1994, after dropping
considerably in fiscal 1993. The rising incidence of deficits is
apparent for cities of all sizes and in all regions but is most
pronounced in western cities. Many cities continue to see
infrastructure needs, federal and state mandates, crime, and the
demand for criminal justice as important sources of budgetary
pressure.
21. With the limited amount of current data on state and local
governments available to BEA, large revisions are not unusual. The
detailed information used for revised estimates is compiled
principally from the Census of Governments. BEA is now using final
data from the Census for FY1992 and preliminary data for FY1993; it
has no additional data on outlays for FY1994 (the year ended
June 30, 1994, for most state governments and about half of all
local governments). On the revenue side, BEA has quarterly tax data
from the Census of Governments through calendar 1993. It also has
more timely information on Medicaid from the Health Care Financing
Administration. But, even with these data, considerable uncertainty
surrounds the estimates of state and local government finances for
the most recent year.

II-45
Given the growing concern about crime, many recent state and
local legislative sessions focused on corrections and law
enforcement. Welfare reform and education also were important
topics. However, proposals for sweeping health care reform failed
in every state where they were considered, and implementation of
major plans has stalled; many legislatures avoided the issue as
debate at the federal level proceeded this year. Meanwhile,
legislation for less ambitious changes in health-care systems has
largely succeeded, particularly those resulting in Medicaid reform.
Labor Costs
In the second quarter, hourly compensation, as measured by the
employment cost index (ECI), rose 3.7 percent at an annual rate,
following a sharp slowing in the first quarter. Over the twelve
months ended in June, ECI hourly compensation increased
223.4 percent. The acceleration in compensation last quarter
largely owed to a pickup in wage and salary growth. Hourly benefit
costs increased 3.7 percent at an annual rate over the March to June
period--just slightly faster than in the first quarter.
Over the past year, growth in wages and salaries has moved up
about 1/2 percentage point with almost all of the pickup due to
23increased earnings of sales workers.23 Wage growth of sales
workers rose from 1.4 percent over the twelve months ended in June
1993 to 4.1 percent ended in June of this year. Excluding sales
occupations, hourly wage and salary growth has held steady at about
3 percent over the past year.
22. Nonfarm hourly compensation increased 3 percent over the same
period. In recent revisions, nonfarm hourly compensation growth was
not revised in 1993 at 2.5 percent, growth in compensation per hour
in 1992 was revised up about 1/2 percentage point to 5.2 percent,
and growth in 1991 was not revised.
23. Earnings of sales workers could increase because of a greater
volume of sales, an increase in the commission rate/base wage, or
both. An increase in the commission rate or base wage is more
indicative of wage pressure. Unfortunately, no information on the
source of change is available from the ECI data.

Increases in hourly benefit costs have slowed nearly
2 percentage points over the past year owing largely to a
deceleration in the growth of health care costs. Growth in
employers' costs for health insurance was 5 percent over the twelve
months ended in June, down nearly 3 percentage points from the
previous year and considerably below the annual rates of increase of
close to 14 percent during the late 1980s. The deceleration in
employers' health costs probably reflects the combination of the
slowing in overall growth in health care costs, efforts by employers
to shift a greater proportion of costs onto workers, and the ongoing
shift away from traditional indemnity plans. Up-to-date data are
limited, but information from the Employee Benefits Survey (EBS) of
Medium to Large Firms (100 or more employees) indicates that the
percent of employees who contributed to their own employer-sponsored
health care plans rose from 35 percent in 1985, before the recent
run-up in ECI hourly health care costs, to more than 50 percent in
1991.24 Also, the percentage of employees participating in
employer-sponsored health plans declined from more than 90 percent
in 1989 (a coverage rate that had held for some time) to 83 percent
in 1991.25
The consumer price index also indicates that the cost of health
care has decelerated considerably. Over the twelve months ended in
July, the CPI for medical care (including services and commodities)
24. The survey covers the same group of firms as contained in the
ECI data. Trends evident between 1985 and 1991 likely have
continued over the most recent 2-1/2 years.
25. Firms have put downward pressure on costs through preferred
provider organizations (PPOs). The EBS indicates that in recent
years participation in PPOs increased considerably at the expense of
traditional fee-for-service plans. The percentage participating in
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) has held steady at about
17 percent in recent years.

rose 4.6 percent.26 This is down from 6.0 percent over the same
period of a year ago and annual increases of more than 9-1/2 percent
in late 1990 and early 1991.
In addition to the slowing in employers' costs for health
insurance, benefit growth has been restrained by a sharp
deceleration in costs for workers' compensation and unemployment
insurance. For workers' compensation, the slowing reflects both the
deceleration in health care costs described above and some changes
in state laws that place additional restrictions on eligibility.
The slowing in unemployment insurance costs largely reflects
improvements in experience ratings, and the better condition of
state unemployment insurance funds associated with the ongoing
strengthening of the labor market.
In contrast to these areas of slowing benefit cost growth,
hourly pension costs and nonproduction bonuses increased more than
10 percent over the past twelve months, compared with increases of
about 6-1/2 percent for the same period a year ago. Anecdotal
evidence indicates that the acceleration in pension costs reflects
the need by some firms to lower overly optimistic investment
assumptions, as well as some efforts by regulators to push companies
with underfunded plans to increase their contributions. The faster
growth in nonproduction bonuses largely reflects improved profits at
many firms over the past year.
The only aggregate data that we have on wages in the third
quarter are average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers. AHE rose 0.4 percent in July, following a decline in the
previous month. The largest increases last month were recorded in
26. The CPI measures list prices of a fixed basket of medical
services and commodities. Although the PCE deflator for medical
services is based partly on the CPI, it also incorporates data on
transactions prices (rather than list prices), which should make it
a better measure of costs paid. The PCE deflator for medical
services increased 4 percent over the year ending in June.

construction and retail trade. Over the past year, AHE rose
2.7 percent--up 1/4 percentage point relative to the same period of
a year ago and at the high end of the range seen over the past
two years. In July, the chain-weighted average hourly earnings
27series rose 0.5 percent.27 The difference between the chain-
weighted and the regular hourly earnings series indicates that
industrial shifts in employment held down wage growth last month.
Prices
In today's release, the consumer price index for July rose
0.3 percent. Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up
0.2 percent--slightly below the increases in May and June. Over the
twelve months through July, the overall CPI has increased
2.8 percent and the CPI excluding food and energy has increased
2.9 percent; both figures are about unchanged from the rates of
increase during the preceding twelve-month period.
Consumer energy prices rose 1.8 percent in July, as the runup
in crude-oil prices since March began to make its way to the retail
level. Gasoline prices rose 3.5 percent, while fuel oil prices
increased 1.1 percent. The CPI for food rose 0.5 percent in July.
27. The chain-weighted series holds industry weights constant from
one month to the next.

Fresh fruit and vegetable prices registered another large increase,
and coffee prices were up 22 percent. Meat prices declined in July,
and price increases for other food categories were quite modest.
Food prices so far this year have risen at a 1-1/2 percent annual
rate, compared with a 3 percent increase in 1993.
In today's CPI report, new vehicle prices rose 0.4 percent.
These price increases reflected the effects of seasonal adjustment;
the prices before seasonal adjustment were unchanged. In recent
years, automotive companies have offered incentive programs at the
end of the model year. This year, however, such incentives were not
needed since stocks of cars and trucks are quite lean. Elsewhere,
apparel prices fell 0.5 percent in July, reflecting summer sales and
the slower-than-usual introduction of fall merchandise. Within the
services category, rent increases picked up in July, but this was
partially offset by a decline in other renters' costs and small
increases in other service components.
Over the six months through July, the CPI excluding food and
energy has increased 3.1 percent at an annual rate, essentially the
same pace as in the six-month period a year earlier. (The
intervening six-month period is distorted by an unusual decline in
tobacco prices.) Prices of consumer goods other than food and
energy have increased 2.5 percent over the past six months, about
twice the pace of the year-earlier period. New motor vehicle prices
have accelerated by about 1-1/2 percentage points at an annual rate,
reflecting both strong demand, which has pushed production of some
models to capacity, and the weakness of the dollar against the
Japanese yen, which has boosted prices of imported models. Among
other goods, apparel prices have also accelerated; however,
movements in these prices can be very erratic.

II-56
In contrast to goods prices, prices of services have continued
to moderate. The CPI for services other than energy has increased
3.4 percent at an annual rate over the past six months, down
1/2 percentage point from the six months ended July 1993. Increases
in rent have picked up a bit, and higher interest rates have boosted
auto financing costs. But offsetting changes have occurred in
airline fares, tuition, entertainment, and medical care services.

An important part of medical services is hospital care. While
hospital prices have decelerated in recent years along with other
medical care services prices, the rate of increase in the CPI for
hospitals has run considerably higher than other measures of
hospital-price increases. Over the twelve months ended July 1994,
the CPI for hospital care increased 5.7 percent, while the latest
reading for the PPI and the PCE deflator indicate twelve-month
increases of 2.9 and 3.7 percent respectively. The differences in
these price increases may reflect the fact that the CPI relies on
list prices for hospital services. By comparison, the PPI for
hospital care explicitly attempts to monitor transactions price.
While the PCE deflator relies, in part, on the CPI series, it also
incorporates information on input costs prepared by the Health Care
Financing Administration. Transactions prices may have been falling

II-57
relative to list prices, as health insurance companies have
increasingly negotiated discounts with hospitals.

1. Fourth quarter to fourth quarter percent change.
Over the first half of the year, the fixed-weight price index
for GDP increased at a 3 percent annual rate, up slightly from the
2-3/4 percent increase over the four quarters of 1993. The pickup
in the price index for the federal government in the first half of
the year was particularly marked, reflecting the unusually large
number of days the government was shut down for inclement weather
and holidays, the effects of the early retirement "buy-out" scheme
for federal workers, and the pay raise in the first quarter of the
year.28 Excluding the federal sector. GDP prices rose about as
fast in the first half of the year as in 1993. The larger
acceleration in the GDP deflator reflects both the price effects
evident in the fixed-weight index and shifts in the composition of
GDP--particularly the slower growth in business purchases of
computers, which have a very low deflator level.
Finished goods prices in yesterday's PPI report rose
0.5 percent, while, excluding food and energy, the PPI was up
0.1 percent. Finished energy prices posted a large 2.5 percent
increase, led by an 8 percent increase in gasoline prices.
28. As noted above, the early retirement program and the unusual
number of shutdowns should have only a transitory effect on the
level of the federal government deflator.

reflecting the recent run-up in crude oil prices. Finished food
prices rose 0.5 percent in July, boosted by a 43 percent jump in
coffee prices.
Prices of intermediate materials other than food and energy
rose 0.4 percent in July after increasing 0.6 percent in June. So
far this year, intermediate materials prices have increased at a
3 percent annual rate, up from 1-1/2 percent over the twelve months
of 1993. The pickup in intermediate materials price increases
likely reflects pressures from tightening capacity utilization and
from higher prices of nonfood, nonenergy crude materials, which have
risen at a 12 percent annual rate so far this year, following an
11 percent increase in 1993.
Spot commodity prices have been mixed since the last Greenbook.
Industrial materials have posted further increases, led by steel
scrap prices, which have surged in response to the continued high
level of demand in this sector. In contrast, prices of the major
crops have plummeted in recent weeks. The price of corn has fallen
16.5 percent since the last Greenbook and the price of soybeans has
dropped almost 17 percent. The recent declines have returned these
prices to their levels before last summer's flood. Coffee prices,
which had surged in the second quarter, increased further in the
early inter-Greenbook period. Although some of the increase has
since been reversed, spot prices are roughly triple the levels of a
year ago.
Driving prices lower for agricultural commodities have been
forecasts of near-record production. As expected at the time of the
last Greenbook, the USDA's August forecast of crop production,
indicates a bumper harvest in the major U.S. grain crops (table).
Corn production is expected to rise 45 percent over last year's
unusually low level, as a result of favorable growing conditions in

the Midwest. The soybean harvest is expected to be roughly
25 percent higher than last year, and wheat production is
anticipated to be in line with last year's output. However, wheat
prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by the expected shortfalls
in world production of wheat, driven particularly by problems in the
former Soviet Union.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates registered mixed changes over the intermeeting
period. A growing sense that additional tightening was not imminent
helped to tilt most rates down in the opening weeks of the period.
These early declines in yield were reversed in August, when the
monthly employment report and other data were interpreted as
suggesting that the economy had retained considerable momentum and
that a policy response would be forthcoming. Major equity indexes
rose 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period, on better-
than-expected earnings reports. The spread of the thirty-year
fixed-rate mortgage over the comparable Treasury yield remained
fairly tight, as did most quality spreads.
The monetary aggregates rebounded sharply in July, after
contracting in June. Growth in M2 was boosted by an acceleration in
liquid deposits and a turnaround in money market mutual funds.
The about-face in money market funds was accompanied by renewed
liquidations of bond mutual funds. The strength in M2 showed
through to M3, which was also propelled by inflows to M3-type money
funds and significant issuance of large time deposits, which at
least in part reflected strong expansion in bank credit.
Borrowing by businesses has apparently picked up some over June
and July, although remaining concentrated at the short end. Boosted
by business lending, as well as strong growth in consumer loans,
bank credit accelerated to a double-digit pace in July. Business
loans were boosted in part by a cutback in capital market financing
as well as by merger-related lending. The pace of public offerings
in corporate equity and bond markets remained sluggish in July,
barely exceeding the slow pace seen during the turbulent markets of
April. Issuance of long-term debt by state and local governments
was similarly slow, as the volume of bonds eligible for refunding

continued to dwindle. In the federal sector, net borrowing is
rising sharply in the current quarter, reflecting a typical seasonal
excess of outlays over receipts. Available data on home mortgage
lending indicate little pickup early in the third quarter. During
the second quarter, consumer credit registered its strongest
quarterly gain of the current expansion, and bank lending to
consumers continued to show considerable strength in July.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 rebounded in July after a weak showing in June. Although
strength in demand deposits provided a boost, the main contribution
was from the nontransaction component of M2. Retail money market
funds had substantial inflows in July after experiencing outflows in
the previous month, in a saw-tooth pattern related to the movement
of long-term interest rates (chart). Over the past few years, as
bond yields have risen, inducing capital losses on bond mutual funds
and other capital market instruments, flows into money funds have
picked up. Bond mutual funds saw a modest inflow in June and then a
larger outflow in July, to an extent mirroring the pattern in money
funds;however, the dollar flows from bond funds were not so
pronounced as those from money funds. A large jump in the level of
overnight Eurodollars also contributed to M2 growth in July.
Although rates on retail CDs moved up considerably in July,
with Treasury yields also rising at the short end, yield spreads on
retail deposits remained unusually wide. In general, deposit rates
seem to be adjusting upward more slowly than is normal for a period
of rising market interest rates. Despite their considerable yield
disadvantage, growth in small time deposits accelerated to a 3-1/4
percent pace in July. Yield differentials were especially wide on
savings deposits (including MMDAs), and this component continued to
run off in July, albeit at a slower rate than in June. From the

fourth quarter of 1993 to July, M2 expanded at a 1-1/2 percent
annual rate. lifting it above the lower bound of its 1-to-5 percent
annual range.
The turnaround in M2 in July showed through to M3, which rose
at a brisk 6 percent pace. M3 was also boosted by an acceleration
in large time deposits, perhaps reflecting increased funding needs
for credit growth at banks. Moreover, institution-only money market
funds, which had seen heavy outflows as short-term rates rose
earlier this year, grew moderately in July. On balance, M3 growth
from the fourth quarter of 1993 to July was at an annual rate of 1/2
percent, moving into its 0-to-4 percent annual range.
After expanding at only a 3 percent annual rate in June, bank
credit accelerated to a 12-1/2 percent pace in July, with both
securities and loans showing strength. Holdings of U.S. government
securities declined slightly, while other securities advanced at a
21 percent annual rate. Most of the growth in other securities was
caused by FIN 39, the accounting standard that limits banks' ability
to net off-balance-sheet contracts. The implementation of this
standard caused a one-time grossing up of other securities earlier
in the year. In addition, FIN 39 has ongoing effects as such off-
balance-sheet positions are marked to market.
Led by the business and consumer categories, loans expanded
smartly in July. Factors contributing to business loans were
merger-related lending and lack of appeal of capital markets to
nonfinancial firms. Even after accounting for these factors,
business loans were quite strong. Banks reported in the August
Survey of Bank Lending Practices that they saw increased demand for
business loans after May, related to rising inventory and working
capital financing needs and stronger investment outlays. The survey
also found that banks continued to assume a more aggressive lending

posture by further easing terms and standards for C&I loans.1
Consumer loans expanded at more than a 20 percent annual rate in
July, but this acceleration over the previous month reflects a lack
of securitizations.
Real estate loans maintained solid growth in July. The recent
prominence of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) in originations may
have continued into July, boosting bank credit, since ARMs are less
likely to be securitized. Moreover, a few banks have been reporting
in recent months that they are more willing to make loans for
nonresidential real estate, and other banks indicate that they have
stopped tightening standards and terms for such loans. About 3
percentage points of the July growth in real estate loans at banks
owed to the acquisition of mortgage assets from thrift institutions.
Reluctant to bid aggressively for retail deposits, banks have
funded loan growth by borrowing from affiliates abroad. July saw
substantial increases in banks' net due-to position with related
foreign offices (chart). U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks have traditionally been large borrowers from foreign
affiliates, especially since 1991. Recently, U.S. chartered banks
have also begun to expand rapidly their net due-to position.
Respondents to the August loan officer survey mentioned more
attractive borrowing costs as a reason why they have been relying
more on this source.
Mutual Funds
Net sales of stock and bond fund shares moderated in the second
quarter (table). Stock funds continued to attract investors.
although inflows have slowed somewhat. Among stock funds, net sales

the equity markets. Inflows to international funds slowed in the
second quarter, and net sales remained relatively light in July.
Bond funds posted small outflows, on balance, over the second
quarter, and preliminary data suggest continued outflows in July.
Net sales of bond funds have been depressed by outflows from
government and GNMA funds, prompted in part by publicity about
capital losses from derivative holdings. Investors retreated from
high-yield funds in July after increasing their holdings by about
$1.5 billion in the second quarter. Municipal bond funds recorded
outflows in the second quarter for the first time since 1987 but saw
a small inflow in July.

Business Finance
Businesses reduced further their use of capital markets in
July. Public bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations slowed to a
$5 billion rate last month from the $7-1/4 billion pace averaged
over the previous two months. The falloff in July owed in large
part to a slide in junk bond issuance. Gross issuance in this
sector was estimated at $1 billion in July--the lowest monthly total

III-9
since the junk market revived, in mid-1991, Junk yield spreads over
Treasuries widened about 15 basis points in July but have since come
back in. In general, spreads over Treasuries remain on the narrow
side.
Ratings changes by Moody's in the second quarter continued the
general pattern seen over the past year. While the financial sector
experienced no downgrades and twenty-one upgrades--ten of these for
bank holding companies--downgrades in the nonfinancial sector
outnumbered upgrades by a factor of three to two. Perhaps most
notable among the upgrades was that of Chrysler Corporation, which
jumped two notches from Baa2 to A3. In a departure from the recent
pattern of ratings changes, downgrades outnumbered upgrades for
speculative-grade industrial firms.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations
slowed to $1.7 billion in July, half of June's pace and one of the
lowest monthly totals in the current business expansion. In keeping
with the recent patterns, the number of IPOs brought to market has
continued high, but prices and volumes of IPOs have come in well
below issuer expectations. Issuance by financial corporations in
July apparently totaled a moderate $3.2 billion, nearly half of
which was accounted for by several large REIT offerings. As a
result of the falloff in gross equity issuance and an increase in
stock repurchases, it now appears likely that net equity issuance
will turn negative this quarter.
Merger and takeover activity seems to be distinctly on the
rise, with implications for share retirements. Repurchases in the
quarter thus far have been boosted by the employee buyout of United
Airlines. Prospective mergers and acquisitions include the takeover
of Gerber by Sandoz and bids for QVC and a large pharmaceutical

firm. Merger activity this year, however, has not yet reached the
levels seen in the late 1980s. Until recently, much of the activity
had been financed with stock-for-stock swaps and therefore had only
a relatively small impact on equity retirement by nonfinancial
corporations.
Amid positive second-quarter earnings reports, major stock
price indexes have moved up from the lows posted at the beginning of
July, with most indexes rising 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent over the
intermeeting period. Among the industrials, the basic materials
group showed the strongest gains, rising about 5 percent during this
period. Second-quarter earnings reports so far suggest that
operating earnings of the firms making up the S&P 500 have climbed
about 15 percent from a year earlier, exceeding most analysts'
expectations.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt was just $12-1/2
billion in July. continuing the second quarter's relatively sluggish
pace. The July figure was boosted by $4 billion in revenue
anticipation warrants (twenty-two month maturity) issued by
California. Short-term issuance was nearly $6-1/2 billion, buoyed
by $3 billion in California revenue anticipation notes. Through
July, long-term issuance is down 40 percent from the comparable
period last year, depressed by the sharp falloff in advance and
current refundings. The decline in refunding volume owes mostly to
the reduction in bonds eligible to be advance refunded. News
concerning municipal securities has continued to be dominated by
California. Passage of a budget paved the way for more borrowing,
narrowly averting the need to issue IOUs.2 Although the state

issued securities totaling $7 billion in a single week, consisting
of both the warrants and notes, they were well received. Almost all
of the warrants were credit-enhanced through letters of credit
provided by an international consortium of banks. The banks
provided the letters of credit only after the budget included a
provision that forces spending cuts if a deficit materializes. S&P
and Moody's gave the credit-enhanced warrants their highest credit
rating. The notes also received the highest ratings, reflecting
high expected cash flow coverage over their short duration.

At the same time, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch all downgraded $18.4
billion in California long-term general obligation debt on July 18.
The S&P downgrade was from A+ to A and Moody's was from Aa to A. In
related actions, S&P lowered the ratings of more than $5 billion of
other California debt, including $273 million of California State
University System revenue bonds and $3.2 billion of appropriation-
backed debt issued through the Public Works Board, the Los Angeles
State Building Authority, and the San Francisco State Building
Authority.

III-13
The ratio of yields on tax-exempts to those on Treasuries has
edged down since the last FOMC meeting and is near its lowest levels
of the year. The yield ratio remained especially low at the short
end, owing in part to strong demand from tax-exempt money market
funds and from bond mutual funds, which have added to their short-
term holdings perhaps to hedge against a further rise in interest
rates.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the $56 billion fiscal deficit in
the third quarter will be financed primarily by $40 billion of
marketable borrowing. The swing in marketable borrowing, from a
thirteen-year low of $8 billion in the second quarter to a level
more in line with recent experience, will remove the support that
the Treasury market has lately enjoyed from low supply.
At the midquarter refunding, the Treasury announced that its
experiment with single-price auctions at two- and five-year note
auctions will be continued indefinitely. After twenty-three rounds
of experimentation, the preliminary evidence on the new auction
technique was judged by Treasury officials to be "neutral to
slightly positive."3 The Treasury also announced that a new 30-
1/4-year bond would be auctioned rather than a 30-year bond, with

auction average rates over when-issued rates at the times of
auctions--a measure of the premium that market participants extract
from the Treasury for bearing the uncertainty of bidding at
auctions--have differed little between single-price and
discriminatory-price auctions. On the positive side, prices have
moved less after single-price auctions than after discriminatory-
price auctions, consistent with the view that more information is
revealed prior to the auction under the single-price format.

the goal of increasing the liquidity and the flexibility of the
strips market. Since last year, when the Treasury began auctioning
long-term bonds semiannually rather than quarterly, the coupon
payment dates of these issues have been concentrated in February and
August. The Treasury hopes that by spreading coupon payments across
four dates, including May and November, long-term bonds will be more
heavily demanded by investors for defeasance purposes or for
constructing synthetic instruments.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on conventional mortgages have registered mixed
changes over the intermeeting period. In the primary market, the
average commitment rate on thirty-year fixed-rate loans is
unchanged, on net, but initial ARM rates have edged up 8 basis
points. Spreads of ARMs to Treasuries remain tight, as many
lenders, especially thrifts, continue to price ARMs aggressively.
Although the FRM-ARM spread has narrowed from its all-time high in
April, by historical standards it remains fairly wide.
The FRM-ARM initial rate spread is an important determinant of
borrowers' demands for ARMs, as is the level of FRM interest rates
(chart). With rates on FRMs remaining well above their lows of last
fall, the wide initial rate advantage of ARMs has contributed to a
steady increase in the ARM share of conventional loans closed at
major institutional lenders. According to Federal Housing Finance
Board data, the ARM share of all conventional home purchase
mortgages closed in June was 43 percent, its largest share since
June 1989. At thrift institutions, the ARM share in June was
71 percent, compared with shares of 27 percent and 44 percent
respectively at mortgage companies and commercial banks. Thrifts
reportedly have been offering very competitive starting rates on

ARMs and thus have been gaining market share in mortgage
originations from commercial banks and mortgage companies.
Available data on mortgage lending activity in the third
quarter suggest little pickup from the slower second-quarter pace.
Adjusted for thrift acquisitions, real estate loan growth at
commercial banks appears to have edged up in July to about a 4-1/2
percent annual rate. Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association's
index of applications to purchase new and existing homes is off
about 10 percent since late June, and the MBA's refinancing index
remains near historical lows.
Given the drop-off in gross mortgage loan originations in
recent months and the rising popularity of ARMs, gross issuance of
agency pass-through securities has slowed sharply from the record
$66 billion pace set last December to $24 billion in June (table).
Historically, issuance of agency pass-through securities has shown a
strong inverse correlation with the level of FRM interest rates
(chart), owing in part to variations in the appeal of ARMs. Thus,
in the current environment of higher long-term interest rates and
lower refinancing activity, some drop-off in gross pass-through
issuance is to be expected.
Among loan categories, much of the increase in pass-throughs
outstanding has been in the conventional market, which continues to
gain market share at the expense of government-backed FHA and VA
loans. Legislation has passed the House that would increase FHA
loan limits, making FHA insurance available to more borrowers and
possibly boosting GNMA market share. The current loan limits are
$67,500 in most parts of the country and up to $151,725 in certain
high-cost markets. The increases in the House bill would raise the

low-cost limit to $101.575 and the high-cost limit to $172,678. The
Senate has yet to act on this legislation.
Issuance of agency multiclass securities declined further in
June, with REMIC production falling to about $5 billion, down from
$8 billion in May and the all-time high of nearly $41 billion in
December 1993. The decline in REMIC issuance owes largely to the
drop in pass-throughs; however, with reports continuing to circulate
about losses on derivative investments, it may also reflect
investors' lingering concerns about the market value and liquidity
of certain specialized tranches. Apparently, turmoil in the MBS
market has had little feedback to the primary market, as spreads to
Treasuries remain relatively tight.
Consumer Installment Credit
Buttressed by a fourth consecutive month of rapid increase in
June, consumer installment credit during the second quarter recorded
its strongest quarterly gain in the current economic expansion. At
a 15-1/2 percent annual rate, growth in the second quarter climbed
to the 15-to-20 percent range attained at some point during most
previous expansions (chart). Such levels were reached sooner in
past upswings, but an unusually slow pickup in spending on consumer
durables in the early stages of this expansion held down consumer
credit growth. Since late last summer, however, outlays for autos
and other durable goods have strengthened, providing a significant
boost to credit expansion. The June increase of 15-1/2 percent
reflected continuing strength in auto and revolving credit. Slower
but still hefty growth was evident in the volatile "other" category,
consisting of personal cash loans, boat and mobile home loans, home
4. It is unclear by how much the new limits would boost FHA
market share. FHA insurance fees are considerably higher than
private mortgage insurance fees. Consequently, even though more
borrowers would fall within the upward revised FHA limits, those who
met the underwriting requirements of the conventional loan market
presumably would still opt for private mortgage insurance.

improvement loans, and other specialized loans to finance consumer
durables. Consistent with these figures, some banks reported
strengthening of consumer loan demand in the August Bank Lending
Practices Survey.
Of the three components of installment credit, revolving credit
has shown the most consistent strength over the past year and a
half. Growing acceptance of credit cards as a means of payment has
likely boosted the growth rate of revolving credit by several
percentage points. For example, credit cards are more frequently
being used for the purchase of groceries, the payment of college
tuition, and, in some states, the payment of taxes.
One reason for the greater use of credit cards for such
payments is the proliferation of programs that tie rebates and other
rewards to the volume of charges made to an account. Prominent
among such programs are those that award credits toward "free"
airline tickets and toward automobile purchases. Airline cards have
existed for several years, but their use has reportedly intensified
in the past two years. General Motors initiated a program in
September 1992, in partnership with a bank subsidiary of Household
International, that grants up to $500 per year in discounts toward
the purchase of a new General Motors car. At the end of June,
receivables under this program totaled $5.8 billion, accounting for
10 percent of the increase in revolving credit outstanding since
September 1992. Ford launched a similar program with Citibank in
February 1993, apparently also with good results. Apple Computer
and some gasoline companies have recently initiated cards with
volume incentives. Because these plans provide the customary "grace
period" of twenty-five to thirty days during which no interest is
assessed if billed amounts are paid in full by the due date,
cardholders can generate a high volume of charges without incurring

III-22
any interest cost. Such usage raises the measured level of consumer
credit.
Rising market interest rates have probably had only little
restraining effect on consumer credit to date, partly because rate
increases on consumer loans have a relatively small impact on
monthly payments and also because consumer rates generally have
risen less than market rates. The Bank Rate Monitor indicates that
rates on new-car loans at banks rose about 3/4 percentage point from
the end of January to the end of July, less than half the increase
in yields on three-year Treasury notes. Over the same period,
credit card rates have apparently risen very little.

APPENDIX
The August Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on
Bank Lending Practices
The August 1994 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices posed questions about changes in bank lending
standards and terms, changes in loan demand by businesses and
households, the maturity of banks' holdings of securities, net
borrowing from banks' offices abroad, and the effects of the Credit
Availability Program.
The results show a continuation of the easing of terms and
standards on loans to both businesses and households found in the
last several surveys, although at a somewhat diminished pace.
Respondents eased terms and standards on commercial and industrial
loans to firms of all size categories, with more banks easing for
middle-market firms than for larger and smaller firms. As in the
February and May surveys, the responses indicated a slight easing of
standards for commercial real estate loans. Respondents reported an
increased willingness to make loans to individuals and, on net, a
slight easing in standards for home mortgage loans. Demand for
business loans increased over the last three months at a significant
fraction of respondent banks, although slightly off the record
numbers reported in the May survey. Demand for credit from
households was mixed across types of credit: demand for mortgages
declined significantly; demand for home equity lines of credit
declined slightly, on net; and demand for consumer installment loans
went up.
Special questions on the survey addressed the average remaining
maturities of banks' holdings of securities. The median responses
indicate an average remaining maturity of just under three years for
banks' investment account assets that are classified as available-
for-sale; three and a half years for investment account securities
classified as held-to-maturity; and two and a half years for trading
account securities. Additional questions examined the recent run-up
in net borrowing from overseas offices by domestic banks and by
branches and agencies of foreign banks. About half the respondents
reported increasing such borrowing over recent periods. Most banks
attributed the increase to lower interest rates abroad. The most
popular source for the borrowing was the eurodollar market and the
most popular maturity was under three months. Special questions
also addressed the effects of the Credit Availability Program (CAP).
Little evidence of an effect on loan terms and standards or loan
volume was found.
Lending to businesses
Commercial and industrial loans other than for mergers.
Between 5 and 10 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported
some easing of credit standards for firms in all size categories,
with the greatest easing reported for middle-market firms and the
least for large firms. The number of respondents who eased was off
slightly from the levels found in the May and February surveys.
Also, for the first time since late last year, several banks
reported tightening standards. Lending standards at foreign
respondents were essentially unchanged.
Many banks responded that they had eased loan terms over the
last three months. Specifically, about half the domestic
respondents eased spreads of loan rates over base rates and the cost
of credit lines for large and middle-market borrowers while under a
quarter eased these terms for small borrowers. Smaller, although
still considerable numbers of banks eased other terms, including

III-A-2
credit line size, loan covenants, and collateralization. The
fraction of foreign respondents that eased terms was similar to that
for domestic banks. The main reason given by respondents for easing
was increased competition followed by a more favorable economic
outlook.
Commercial real estate loans. Domestic respondents indicated
that credit standards for commercial real estate loans eased
slightly, on net. Only a few banks indicated any change in
standards for commercial office buildings, with one more bank having
eased than tightened. The results were about the same for other
forms of commercial real estate. The February and May surveys also
found evidence of a slight easing.
Demand. Demand for business loans strengthened over the last
three months at a significant fraction of respondent banks. Between
a fifth and a third of banks reported increased demand from firms of
various sizes, with the largest fraction reporting increased demand
from middle-market firms. These fractions are slightly off the
record levels reported in the previous survey, but still indicate
strong demand for business loans. Banks attributed the increased
demand largely to increases in customers' inventory financing needs
and expenditures on plant and equipment. Surprisingly few banks
attributed the increased demand to reductions in nonbank financing,
although this may be because banks are more aware of the purpose of
a loan than their customer's alternative sources of funds.
Lending to households
Respondents were also more willing to make consumer and
residential mortgage loans. About 20 percent of the respondents
were more willing now than three months ago to make consumer
installment and home equity loans. On net, only a few banks eased
standards for approving mortgage applications for purchasing homes.
With respect to the demand for household credit, the survey
results were mixed across types of credit. As in May, respondents
experienced a significant decline in demand for residential
mortgages, with over half the banks, on net, reporting a decline and
several banks reporting a substantial decline. Demand for home
equity lines of credit decreased at some banks and increased at
others; on net, less than 10 percent of the banks experienced a
decrease. Demand for consumer installment credit increased, on net,
with about 20 percent of the respondents indicating an increase in
demand.
Securities
At the beginning of 1994 banks, in accordance with financial
accounting standard 115 (FAS 115), began marking to market those
securities in their investment portfolio that are classified as
available for sale. The August survey asked the respondents for the
average maturities of the three classifications of securities: held
in investment accounts and classified as available for sale, held in
investment accounts and classified as held to maturity, and held in
trading accounts. The survey responses indicate that the maturities
of banks' portfolios are quite different across banks, with several
banks indicating average maturities of less than two years and many
indicating maturities of greater than five years. Overall, the
median average maturity of the trading account was shortest, two and
a half years; followed by the available-for-sale securities in the
investment account, just under three years; and the held-to-maturity
1. As in May, increased competition was the most common reason
provided for easing, even though it was not listed as a reason for
easing of terms and standards.

III-A-3
securities had the longest average maturity, about three and a half
years.
Borrowing from abroad
Since mid-1993, U.S. domestic banks have significantly
increased their net borrowing from their non-U.S. offices and
international banking facilities (I.B.F.). Since mid-1991, branches
and agencies have significantly increased their net borrowing from
their parent bank, their parent bank's non-U.S. offices and their
I.B.F. Questions on the August survey explored the reasons for and
the characteristics of this increase in borrowing from abroad.
About half of the domestic and foreign respondents indicated that
they had increased this source of funding. The most frequently
cited reason for the increase was lower interest rates abroad. The
responses indicate that banks avoid currency exposure in the
transactions by borrowing primarily in the eurodollar market.
Virtually all of the domestic respondents indicated that they most
commonly borrowed at maturities under six months, with almost two-
fifths of respondents indicating an overnight maturity and a like
amount indicating other maturities under three months. All of the
foreign respondents indicated that they most commonly borrowed at
maturities under six months.
Effects of the Credit Availability Program
In March 1993, the Credit Availability Program (CAP) was
announced. The CAP included the following initiatives: regulatory
changes allowing the strongest banks and thrifts to make and carry a
limited portfolio of small business and farm loans with minimal
documentation, reductions in the appraisal burden on loans secured
by real estate, changes in the rules for financing the sale of OREO,
clarification of the use of the category other assets especially
mentioned, and improvements in the examination process. The August
1993 survey asked the domestic respondents a series of questions
about the effects of the CAP and found that it did not have a
substantial effect on the supply of credit to small and medium-sized
businesses. At that time, many respondents anticipated that the
reductions in the appraisal burdens, which had not yet been
implemented, would have a substantial effect. Recently bank
regulatory agencies increased from $100,000 to $250,000 the
threshold level above which the services of an appraiser are
required for loans collateralized with real estate. They have also
exempted from appraisal requirements business loans of $1 million or
less where the sale of, or rental income derived from, the real
estate taken as collateral is not the primary source of repayment.
The current survey asked domestic respondents if these changes
affected their terms and standards and loan volumes. Both changes
had allowed less than 20 percent of respondents to ease lending
terms and standards and resulted in increased lending volume at less
than 10 percent of respondents. Even fewer banks indicated a change
in terms and standards or loan volume resulting from the other
initiatives of the CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents said
that none of the initiatives had any effect on their bank's lending
to small and medium-sized businesses. Among those banks that stated
the CAP had had some effect, most selected improvements in the
examination process as having had the largest effect.

In May, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services widened
slightly from what was recorded in April; for April-May combined,
the deficit was larger than in the first quarter by $9 billion at an
annual rate and was significantly larger than at any time since
1988. Data for June will be released on August 18.

Exports of goods and services were about the same in May as in
April with increased shipments of machinery and industrial supplies
offset by reduced exports of aircraft and gold. For the two months
combined, exports were stronger than in the first quarter by 11
percent at an annual rate; increases occurred in both goods and
services with the sharpest rises recorded for machinery (especially
to Canada, the United Kingdom, and expanding markets in Asia),
automotive products to Canada and Mexico, industrial supplies
(largely chemicals, aluminum, and paper), and travel and
transportation receipts from foreigners.
Imports of goods and services were slightly higher in May than
in April; most of the rise was in oil (higher prices) and consumer

goods. For the two months combined, imports were higher than in the
first quarter by 15 percent at an annual rate. The increase was
spread about evenly among all major merchandise trade categories;
service payments to foreigners declined slightly. Higher imports of
machinery and non-oil industrial supplies (especially metals)
reflected the strength of U.S. expenditures on business equipment
and construction supplies. The rise in imported consumer goods was
largely in durable items such as household goods and recreational
and home entertainment equipment, and appears to have contributed to
a sharp run-up in U.S. retail inventories. Two-thirds of the
increase in imported consumer goods in April-May came from China.
In May, the quantity of imported oil declined for the second
consecutive month. Nonetheless, for April/May combined imports
averaged a bit above the first quarter rate as a decline in
consumption was more than offset by an increase in U.S. stocks.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics suggest that in June oil
consumption increased sharply with the onset of the driving season,
likely pushing imports above 9.5 mb/d.
Prices of U.S. Imports and Exports
Prices of imported oil have continued to rise, climbing more
than $1.00 per barrel in May as OPEC production remained roughly
unchanged in the face of increasing oil demand, both in the United
States and abroad. For April-May on average, the price of imported
oil was 11 percent (NOT an annual rate) higher than in the first
quarter. Since the June Greenbook, West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
spot and futures prices have risen on balance in response to unrest
in Nigeria. Spot WTI peaked in early August at almost $21.00 per
barrel, and is currently trading at [$18.55] per barrel. These
developments should lead to further increases in import prices in
July and August.

Prices of non-oil imports rose 0.3 percent in June, about the
same rate as in four of the previous five months. In the second
quarter on average, prices (BLS) rose 2.8 percent at an annual rate;
while increases were recorded in all major end-use trade categories,
the largest rise was in foods. Two aspects of non-oil import price
developments are worth noting -- price increases in recent months
are a bit stronger than a year earlier, and prices (fixed-weight
excluding computers) now have risen in five consecutive quarters (at
an average annual rate of 2.4 percent); the last period of sustained
import price rise was 1987-88.
Prices of agricultural exports fell in June bringing the
decline in the second quarter to 7.5 percent at an annual rate.
This was the first price decline recorded since the second quarter
of 1993 and reflected, in part, an improvement in crop conditions.
In June, prices of nonagricultural exports rose for the sixth
consecutive month. The increase in the second quarter was slightly
more than in the first quarter, but was still less than 3 percent
AR. Price increases were recorded in most major trade categories,
led by a rise in industrial supplies. Slightly offsetting this
increase was a decline in the price of exported capital goods.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States rose by $13
billion in June, largely as the result of central bank efforts to
stabilize the foreign exchange value of the dollar. (See line 1 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) Partial
information from the FRBNY suggests that G-10 holdings rose by a
further net $6 billion in July. For the second quarter as a whole,
large increases in holdings by the G-10 countries were offset
somewhat by reduced holdings of several OPEC countries and Mexico.

Large net capital inflows through banks (including RPs by
nonbank securities dealers) continued in June (line 3). During the
second quarter, both U.S. and foreign-based banks relied on net
borrowings from their own offices outside the United States as an
important source of funds. In addition, $16 billion of the $38
billion inflow was accounted for by swings in RP transactions of
nonbank securities dealers. Moreover, the Brazilian debt
restructuring in April resulted in a shift of about $5 billion from
reported bank claims to holdings of securities.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) were
modest in June and amounted to only $6.6 billion in the second
quarter as a whole. Net purchases of U.S. corporate and government
agency bonds (line 4b) were very strong, particularly in June,
reflecting in part settlement for the large volume of Eurobonds
issued by U.S. borrowers in May. In contrast, private foreigners
sold U.S. Treasury securities net (line 4a) during the quarter.
Large net sales of Treasury securities were recorded for the British
West Indies and Bermuda. (It appears that some of the proceeds from
these sales probably were lent back to U.S. nonbank securities
dealers; net liabilities of U.S. nonbank securities dealers to
nonbanks in the British West Indies and Bermuda increased by $10.2
billion in the second quarter.) In contrast, Japanese residents
were recorded as having bought over $10 billion in U.S. Treasury
securities in the second quarter. In addition, private foreigners
reduced their holdings of U.S. corporate stocks (line 4c) in the
second quarter, as stock prices remained below the highs reached
earlier in the year.
U.S. residents continued to add to their holdings of foreign
stocks in the second quarter (line 5b), but increases in holdings of
foreign bonds (line 5a) were far more modest. Net purchases of

IV-9
stocks in Japan accounted for about 40 percent of total net
purchases in the second quarter, in contrast to more than 50 percent
in the first quarter. Net purchases of foreign bonds were held down
in the second quarter, as they were in the first quarter, by very
large sales to the United Kingdom in the last month of the quarter.
Through the first six months of 1994, U.S. residents have sold net
$23 billion in foreign bonds to the United Kingdom. In contrast,
U.S. residents made large net purchases of foreign bonds from the
rest of Europe and Brazil (the latter in connection with Brazil's
debt restructuring).
Net shipments of U.S. currency abroad by banks reporting to
the FRBNY picked up from $5.1 billion in the first quarter to $8.2
billion in the second quarter. Of the total so far this year, $8.2
billion net has been shipped to Russia.
BEA is continuing its efforts to estimate changes in foreign
holdings of U.S. currency, but no data were incorporated in the U.S.
International Transactions Accounts in this June's revisions. BEA
did revise its estimates of credit extended by banks outside the
United States to U.S. nonbanks. As with data on the Eurodeposits of
U.S. nonbank residents, BEA is now using data from the BIS, Federal
Reserve, and other central banks instead of the notoriously
inadequate components from the Treasury International Capital (TIC)
reports. (See lines 4 and 5 of the International Banking Data
table.)

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar has
shown little net change on balance since the July 5 FOMC meeting.
Over this period, the dollar has depreciated about 1-1/2 percent
against the mark and risen about 1 percent relative to the yen. The
dollar declined in early July, apparently reflecting market
perceptions that U.S. officials were not concerned over the dollar's
value, or perhaps even were willing to look favorably on dollar
depreciation as a way of creating pressure in trade negotiations
with Japan. However, the dollar recovered these loses later in the
month following statements of concern over the dollar by Chairman
Greenspan and Treasury officials. On July 20, Chairman Greenspan in
his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony indicated that the weakness of the
dollar was a concern and had recently been a focus of Federal
Reserve policy. The next day Treasury Under Secretary Summers
stated that the Administration wanted the dollar to strengthen in
value and that a dollar decline had potentially adverse
consequences. The July 31 announcement that the Unites States was
starting trade sanctions proceedings against Japan over
discriminatory government procurement practices for
telecommunications and medical equipment caused only a temporary
decline of the dollar against the yen.
Since the July FOMC meeting, the weighted-average of short-term
interest rates in the major industrial countries has risen about 15
basis points while U.S. short-term rates have declined 5 basis
points. The largest individual change has been in Italy, where
short-term rates have risen 130 basis points. Most of this rise
took place after the Bank of Italy's August 11 announcement of 50
basis point increases in its official lending rates in an attempt to
provide support for the lira. In Canada, the three-month rate has

IV-12
declined by 75 basis points in response to an easing of pressure on
the Canadian dollar, apparently reflecting some lessening market
concerns over the outcome of the upcoming Quebec provincial
elections. Since reaching a peak in late June, Canadian short-term
interest rates have declined about 100 basis points, reversing about
one-third of their rise of earlier in the year. Short-term rates in
the United Kingdom have risen 50 basis points over the past month.
Indications of strength in the U.K. economy seem to have convinced
market participants that the next interest rate adjustment by the
Bank of England is likely to be an increase. Japanese short-term
rates have edged up about 20 basis points over the past month,
apparently reflecting a growing perception that the Bank of Japan is
likely soon to start nudging short-term interest rates higher as the
Japanese economy turns around.
Short-term interest rates in Germany have shown almost no net
change since the July FOMC meeting. On July 21, the Bundesbank
Council, at its last meeting before its August recess, decided to
keep its discount and Lombard rates unchanged and indicated that for
the following four weeks the repo transactions through which the
Bundesbank provides liquidity to the German money market would be
conducted at a fixed rate of 4.85 percent. In the weeks leading up
to this announcement, the repo rate had been reduced in
progressively smaller increments to 4.88 percent.
The weighted-average of long-term interest rates in the foreign
industrial countries has increased about 20 basis points since the
July FOMC meeting, while U.S. long-term rates has been about
unchanged on balance over this period. The long-term rate in
Germany has risen about 25 basis points on balance, and long-term

rates in other European countries have also generally moved higher.
Nearly all of the increases in European long-term rates came in the
wake of the August 11 announcements by the Swedish and Italian
central banks of increases in their official lending rates.
Although these moves appeared to have come in response to
exclusively internal developments unique to Italy and Sweden, they
appear to have reinforced market perceptions that the next short-
term interest rate moves in a number of other European are also
likely to be in an upward direction, and touched off a sharp rise in
long-term rates throughout Europe. In Japan, the long-term rate has
risen by about 25 basis points over the past month, apparently
reflecting market perceptions that the Japanese economy is starting
to show signs of reviving, as well as concerns over the possible
impact on future interest rates of the widening Japanese budget
deficit.
The Desk has not
intervened over this period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Monthly indicators suggest that recovery continued in the
second quarter in the major foreign industrial countries. The
moderate recovery in continental Europe that began late last year
appears to have firmed, while growth continued at a healthy pace in
the United Kingdom and Canada. In Japan, where signs of established
recovery still are tentative, economic activity softened somewhat
from the strong expansion registered in the first quarter, but
growth, albeit on a weaker pace, continued.
In the United Kingdom and Canada, unemployment rates in the
second quarter fell from rates registered in the first quarter.

IV-15
Unemployment in western Germany and France may have peaked in the
second quarter as rates in June edged down from May. Nevertheless.
the unemployment rate in every foreign G-7 country remains high by
historical standards.
Consumer price inflation remains subdued, especially in Canada
and Japan where excise tax cuts and yen appreciation respectively
have lowered year-on-year inflation rates to zero. However, input
prices in the United Kingdom have picked up in recent months.
Individual Country Notes. In Japan, second-quarter data suggest
that GDP growth likely slowed from the nearly 4 percent (SAAR) pace
registered in the first quarter. Industrial production and housing
starts moved up moderately in the April-June period, and the index
of leading indicators remained well above the boom-bust demarcation
line of 50. Machinery orders in May and June regained part of the
sharp drop-off registered in April. In contrast, new car
registrations declined sharply in the second quarter, despite the
pickup in June, and the most recent measures of labor market
tightness -- particularly the job offers-to-applicants ratio --
showed further deterioration.

IV-16
as discriminatory against imports, giving Japan 60 days to take
corrective steps or face the risk of higher sanctions on some
exports to the United States. This development added temporarily to
downward pressure on the dollar against the yen, exacerbating
concerns that the rising yen may stifle Japan's nascent recovery.
Notwithstanding the roughly 10 percent appreciation of the yen
against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Japan's trade
surplus totalled $126.5 billion (SAAR) in the first seven months of
1994. up from the $119.6 billion surplus registered in all of 1993.
This increase largely reflects movements in dollar prices of
Japanese exports and imports, stemming in part from the rise in the
yen. Measures of the constant-dollar value of Japan's trade, based
on wholesale export and import price indices, indicate that the real
surplus has declined thus far in 1994 from its 1993 average.
In western Germany, available data suggest that recovery likely
strengthened further in the second quarter. Industrial production
and manufacturing orders posted moderate gains, and the rate of
capacity utilization exceeded 80 percent for the first time since
the fourth quarter of 1992. However, retail sales in the second
quarter were down 3.3 percent relative to the first quarter. In
eastern Germany, industrial production (NSA) has continued to show
strong gains, advancing 19.2 percent during the year ending in May.

Growth of the targeted monetary aggregate M3 has moderated
since the early months of this year but remains high. In June,
German M3 increased 11.4 percent (SAAR) relative to the fourth
quarter of 1993, down from 13.4 percent in May. It appears unlikely
that M3 will fall within its official target range of 4 to 6 percent
this year. In its mid-year review on July 21, the Bundesbank
Council reaffirmed this year's target range for M3 growth.
First-quarter GDP growth in France recently was revised upward
to 2.8 percent (SAAR) from an initial estimate of 2 percent. This
upward revision was largely due to an increase in the contribution
from inventories and a smaller negative contribution from business
fixed investment.

Monthly indicators suggest that the French recovery continued
in the second quarter. Industrial production rose in April and May
due to stronger manufacturing output. The increase in May was small
relative to April due to unseasonably cold weather in April that
contributed to a temporary rise in energy output. Second-quarter
consumption appears to have been quite strong as consumption of
manufactured products rose sharply. Survey data for June show that
business confidence and domestic and foreign orders continued to
improve. Employment data for June indicate that French unemployment
may have peaked in May--somewhat earlier than expected.

exceeds its previous peak in the second quarter of 1990. Underlying
inflation continues to remain subdued, and inflation in average
earnings has stabilized. However, input prices have picked up in
recent months.
In Italy, growth in the first quarter slowed considerably from
the strong pace registered in the fourth quarter of 1993. Although
consumption and fixed investment rose 1.4 percent (SAAR) and 7
percent respectively, total domestic demand fell as government
spending declined and inventories continued to run off. For the
eighth consecutive quarter, net exports made a positive contribution
to growth.

Available indicators suggest that the recovery may have gained
momentum in the second quarter. Industrial production (NSA) posted
a strong gain on a year-on-year basis, and capacity utilization
moved up. Consumer confidence soared to levels not reached since the
September 1992 ERM crisis, and although it softened as the quarter
progressed, business sentiment remained strong. Car sales were up
from levels registered one year ago, and machine tool orders
rebounded sharply. On the negative side, the unemployment rate rose
further.

Preliminary data for Canada indicate that economic activity
continued to expand at a robust pace in the second quarter.
Strength in manufacturing industries boosted industrial production
in April and May, and the Index of Business Confidence reached its
highest level in 15 years. Employment gains remained strong through
July. Consumer confidence slipped, however, as consumers expressed
increased caution about spending plans in light of recent steep
interest rate increases. Consumer-price inflation remains subdued.
Excluding the effects of recent excise tax cuts, inflation in the
second quarter averaged 1.4 percent (year-on-year).

Economic Situation in Other Countries
The Mexican economy has experienced signs of economic recovery,
as export performance has been stimulated by NAFTA as well as a more
competitive real exchange rate. Uncertainty about the August 21
presidential election contributed to strong pressure on the peso in
early July, but this pressure abated and the exchange rate
subsequently appreciated. In Venezuela, recently imposed foreign
exchange and price controls have caused shortages of imported raw
materials and a sharp contraction in industrial output and exports.
Brazil has implemented a new stabilization program that pegs its
currency to the U.S. dollar, and monthly inflation fell from 50
percent in June to 7.8 percent in July. In Argentina, the
unemployment rate has reached a record high of 10.8 percent despite
strong growth in industrial production and exports.
In China, output growth and inflation slowed slightly in the
first half of 1994, and the trade deficit declined sharply.
Taiwan's industrial output in June was up 9.8 percent (year/year),
while Korea's second-quarter industrial production was up 10 percent
(year/year). In Russia, inflation has slowed in recent months, but
the fiscal outlook has deteriorated due to an increase in tax
evasion and an unexpectedly steep decline in industrial production.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, new data on GDP growth is
expected to be released prior to the August 21 presidential and
congressional elections. First-quarter real GDP growth is likely to
be revised upward to nearly 1 percent (year/year), compared with the
previous estimate of 0.5 percent. Recent sectoral data suggests
that GDP growth may have risen further in the second quarter.
Signs of economic recovery have been visible in the growth of
imports (19.3 percent higher in January-May 1994 than in the same
period of 1993) and of exports of manufactured goods (25 percent

IV-25
higher). Total exports during January-May were up 17.3 percent from
the same period in 1993, despite a 14 percent drop in the value of
petroleum exports. The cumulative trade deficit reached $7.3
billion, up $1.5 billion from the same period a year
earlier.Automobile companies are responsible for a substantial share
of increased trade, as production lines at Mexican and U.S.
facilities are restructured under the impetus of NAFTA. Export
performance in recent months has also been stimulated by U.S.
economic expansion and a more competitive real exchange rate. The
peso depreciated by nearly 9 percent against the dollar from mid-
February through July, while consumer price inflation remained
steady at about 0.5 percent per month over this period. At the end
of July, the CPI was 6.8 percent higher than a year earlier.
In early July, uncertainty about the approaching presidential
election contributed to strong pressure against the peso, but this
pressure abated and the exchange rate subsequently appreciated.
As shown in the following chart on Mexican financial markets, the
peso/dollar exchange rate moved away from the "lower" limit of its
fluctuation band, and was 0.6 percent above the "lower" limit on
August 11. The Mexico City stock market index on August 11 was 33
percent above the trough recorded in April, but remained 10 percent
below last February's all-time high. The rate on one-month peso-
denominated Treasury bills at the August 10 auction declined further
to 15.2 percent, but remained well above its mid-February low of
8.8 percent.
In Venezuela, the Caldera administration's adoption of foreign
exchange and price controls has disrupted trade and economic
activity. These controls were imposed by emergency decree on June
27 in response to rapidly deteriorating inflation and international
reserves. Foreign exchange markets were closed for two weeks until

detailed regulations could be issued, and trading resumed in mid-
July at a single official rate of 170 bolivars per dollar, a
revaluation of 15 percent from the previous free market rate.
Although foreign exchange purchases for foreign travel and debt
service were authorized by the new Exchange Control Board, importers
did not receive approval for any foreign exchange purchases until
July 28.
Shortages of imported raw materials reportedly forced
widespread plant shutdowns and accelerated vacations during July,
causing a substantial drop in industrial production. Non-oil
exports fell an estimated 50 percent in July, after falling 20
percent the previous month. The flow of imports presumably slowed
to a trickle in July, after a 30 percent drop in imports over the
previous six months due to weak economic activity. Foreign exchange
reserves increased by about $900 million during July to an estimated
$9.8 billion. The authorities have indicated that the central bank
will sell importers about $300 million per month in foreign
exchange, about half the amount required to finance imports at
January-June levels. Despite the evident shortfall in the supply of
dollars, the government has apparently succeeded thus far in
suppressing a black market inside Venezuela by announcing heavy
fines and prison sentences for foreign exchange violations.
However, a small parallel market has developed across the border in
Colombia, with bolivars trading at a discount of about 25 percent
below the official exchange rate.
Price controls have been imposed on over 100 basic goods and
services, including price rollbacks of 10 to 20 percent on some
products. These controls probably contributed to the drop in
industrial output, with only partial success in restraining
inflation. The consumer price index rose 6.3 percent in July, down

IV-28
from 9 percent inflation in June, but still more than twice the
inflation rate of 3.1 percent a year earlier. Government officials
blamed July's inflation on raw materials shortages. However, the
recent shift to a highly expansionary monetary policy has probably
contributed to the upward pressure on prices. In mid-July, the
central bank cut its discount rate to 45 percent, from 73 percent
a week earlier.
In late June, an emergency oversight board was established with
very broad authority over the banking system. The oversight board
may instruct a bank to deposit funds in another bank, and may
confiscate the assets of any bank that fails to comply with board
directives. In early August, the authorities took over Banco de
Venezuela, the country's second-largest bank and the tenth bank to
be taken over this year.
Brazil's implementation of a new stabilization program has
caused a sharp drop in the inflation rate. Under the Plan Real, a
new currency called the real was introduced on July 1, and the
central bank is committed to maintaining the value of the currency
at no less than one dollar per real. Confidence in the new plan has
been strengthened by the central bank's large holdings of
international reserves, which exceeded $40 billion at the end of
May. In fact, tight monetary policy in July generated upward
pressure on domestic interest rates and contributed to an
appreciation of the currency to $1.10 per real on August 11.
Consumer prices (in real terms) rose by 7.8 percent in July,
compared with June's inflation rate of 50 percent under the old
currency. However, the long-term sustainability of the plan depends
on the extent to which Brazil reduces its fiscal deficit and avoids
the need for inflationary financing. The impact of recent fiscal
adjustments remains unclear, despite optimistic government claims.

Brazil's unemployment rate was 5.5 percent over the first six
half of 1994, down slightly from 5.7 percent a year earlier. The
cumulative trade surplus for January-June was $7 billion, roughly
unchanged from a year earlier.
In Argentina, the unemployment rate has reached a record high
despite strong growth in industrial production and exports. In
May's semi-annual survey, urban unemployment jumped to 10.8 percent,
up from 6.6 percent in 1992 and 9.9 percent in 1993. Meanwhile,
industrial production during January-May was up 6.2 percent from a
year earlier. Faced with relatively high labor costs and the
elimination of tariffs on imported capital goods, the manufacturing
sector has cut back its work force and invested heavily to achieve
higher labor productivity and improve its international competitive-
ness. Unemployment has also risen due to layoffs by privatized
utilities and by provincial governments with more stringent budget
requirements. The Menem administration has responded to higher
unemployment by establishing job retraining, by changing regulations
to stimulate employment in the construction sector, and by pushing
legislation to increase the flexibility of work arrangements.
The January-May trade deficit widened to $1.8 billion, from
$140 million a year earlier, reflecting moderate export growth and
soaring capital goods imports. In early August, Argentina and
Brazil reached agreement on the structure of external tariffs of the
Mercosur customs union, which is scheduled for implementation on
January 1, 1995.
Consumer prices in July were 3.6 percent higher than a year
earlier. However, recent polls reveal widespread perceptions that
the benefits of low inflation and rapid economic growth have not
"trickled down" to the average working family. In early August,

IV-30
a constitutional assembly gave final approval to reforms that will
permit President Menem to run for a second term, but growing public
discontent has clouded the prospects for his reelection next year.
In China, output growth and inflation slowed slightly in the
first half of 1994, while the trade deficit declined sharply.
Output grew 11.6 percent (year/year), down from 13.7 percent a year
earlier. Urban consumer inflation in June slowed to 23 percent
(year/year), down from February's peak of 26 percent. China ran a
trade deficit of $820 million over the first six months of 1994,
down from $2.7 billion a year earlier, as export growth of 30
percent outpaced import growth of 20 percent.
Foreign direct investment in China during the first half of
1994 was $14.7 billion, up 55 percent from the same period of 1993.
Foreign exchange reserves reached $32 billion in June, up sharply
from $21 billion at the beginning of the year. The rapid increase
in official reserves reflects the shrinking trade deficit, large
capital inflows, and the influence of the unified exchange rate
system established in January. The new system has provided Chinese
enterprises with more stable access to foreign exchange and has
reduced the incentive to hide export earnings abroad.
In a July report to Congress, the U.S. Treasury concluded again
that China's manipulation of its foreign exchange system prevents
effective adjustment of the balance of payments. The U.S. Treasury
particularly objected to the exclusion of foreign-funded enterprises
from the new interbank foreign exchange market.
Taiwan's industrial production in June was 9.8 percent higher
than a year earlier; for the first half of 1994, industrial
production was up 6.9 percent. The January-July trade surplus was
$3.1 billion, down from $4 billion a year earlier. Exports rose 4.2
percent, and imports grew 6.7 percent. Foreign exchange reserves

IV-31
topped $90 billion at the end of June, boosted by the appreciation
of the yen and deutschmark.
In Korea, second-quarter industrial production rose about 10
percent (year/year), with particularly strong growth in the
automotive and electronics sectors. Although the central bank has
pursued a less-accommodative monetary policy since mid-February,
consumer price inflation rose to 6.9 percent (year/year) in June, up
from 4.3 percent a year earlier. The unexpected jump in inflation
prompted a further tightening of liquidity, and the three-month time
deposit rate rose to 14.5 percent on August 9, up about 200 basis
points since early June.
Merchandise imports during the first half of 1994 rose 14.6
percent from a year earlier, while exports grew by 11.4 percent.
The current account deficit rose sharply to $2.7 billion over
January-April, up from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
On July 1, the government changed its regulations to allow
small- and medium-sized Korean enterprises to sell convertible bonds
directly to foreign investors. Overseas borrowing had previously
been limited mainly to firms engaged in producing technologically
sophisticated manufactured goods. To promote greater international
portfolio diversification, the government also liberalized
restrictions on foreign stock purchases by domestic residents.
In Russia, official statistics indicate that real GDP fell 17
percent during the first half of 1994 (year/year), while industrial
production was 26 percent below its year-earlier level. The sharp
contraction in output has been exacerbated by rising fuel and raw
materials prices, growing inter-enterprise arrears, and reduced
government purchases. However, these official statistics probably
overstate the actual decline in economic activity, due to incomplete
coverage of the private sector. Russia's largest private investment

IV-32
fund, the MMM corporation, collapsed in late July, but no immediate
macroeconomic impact was evident.
Inflation has slowed in recent months; consumer prices
increased by 4.8 percent in June and by 5.1 percent in July,
compared with last year's average rate of over 20 percent per month.
The ruble has depreciated at a steady rate of about 1 percent a week
since late February. On August 11, the MICEX exchange rate was 2108
rubles per dollar. The Central Bank of Russia has progressively
lowered its refinance rate from 17.5 percent a month in April to
12.5 percent a month in early August, but the rate remains
substantially higher than monthly consumer price inflation.
A large shortfall in revenue contributed to the fiscal deficit
of about 10 percent of GDP during January-June, well above this
year's target of 7.2 percent of GDP specified in the Systemic
Transformation Facility (STF) arrangement with the IMF. The revenue
shortfall reflects the unexpectedly steep decline in industrial
production, growing tax evasion, and incomplete implementation of
revenue enhancement measures outlined in the STF.
