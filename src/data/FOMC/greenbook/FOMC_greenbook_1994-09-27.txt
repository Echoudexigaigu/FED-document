The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy appears to have expanded at an appreciable clip
this quarter. Payroll growth reportedly slowed in August, but the
trend of hiring has remained quite strong, according to a range of
indicators. Manufacturing activity has evidenced notable strength
of late, boosted by a pickup in motor vehicle production. Measures
of demand are mixed across sectors, with the overall picture being
one of firming final sales, especially of consumer goods, and
slowing inventory investment. Against a backdrop of rising resource
utilization and the earlier rise in oil prices, materials costs have
continued to surge, and the consumer price index has increased a bit
faster in the past couple of months than during the spring.
Employment and Unemployment
Payrolls grew less rapidly in August, but still at a fairly
brisk rate. Nonfarm employment rose about 180,000, following gains
averaging 280,000 per month over the first seven months of the year.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers
declined to 34.5 hours from a relatively high level in July, and
aggregate hours of production workers fell 0.2 percent.
Nevertheless, the average level of hours during July and August was
1.9 percent (annual rate) above the second-quarter level.
The unemployment rate was unchanged, at 6.1 percent, in August.
The labor force participation rate jumped to 66.6 percent, its
highest level since April, but household employment also surged
714,000. Even so, the increase in household employment so far this

year still trails the gain in payroll employment by nearly
1 million.1
The slowdown in hiring reported in the August payroll survey
was concentrated in retail trade and construction. Retail trade
employment was unchanged in August; however, this followed gains
totaling more than 200,000 in the previous two months. Much of the
deceleration owed to a decline at eating and drinking
establishments, where employment may have been boosted temporarily
in June and July by activity associated with the World Cup. (The
baseball strike occurred after the August survey reference week.)
Construction employment fell 6,000, largely because of a
decline in heavy construction, which includes highway and street
construction (but not buildings). In addition, hiring by special
trade contractors (carpenters, plumbers, and electricians) was the
slowest (only 1,000) in more than a year.
In contrast, manufacturing payrolls rose 32,000 in August.
Much of the strength came in motor-vehicle-related sectors, but
employment was up in a number of other industries as well, including
electrical machinery, apparel, and printing. In addition, the
factory workweek increased to 42 hours--close to the postwar highs
recorded earlier this year; average overtime hours matched the
postwar high of 4.8 recorded in April. Outside of manufacturing,
the workweek was down or unchanged in most major sectors.
Other indicators suggest that labor market conditions remain
firm. Weekly filings of initial claims for unemployment insurance
have fluctuated in a relatively low range of 320,000 to 340,000 per
week since the latter part of July. The Manpower, Inc., index of
1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary review of unedited
data from state unemployment insurance records for 1994:Q1 suggests
that the gap will widen when the payroll series is rebenchmarked next
June. At this point, the BLS expects to revise the March 1994 level
of payroll jobs upward by 300,000 to 500,000--toward the high end of
the historical range of benchmark adjustments.

II-7
net hiring strength for the fourth quarter is little changed from
its high second- and third-quarter levels.
Revised data indicate that labor productivity in the nonfarm
business sector fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second
quarter. This decline is twice the rate initially estimated and was
due entirely to a downward revision to nonfarm business output. The
sharp decrease in output per hour in the second quarter almost
offset the first-quarter gain, but the level of productivity was
still up 2-1/4 percent from a year earlier.
The offsetting movements in labor productivity over the first
two quarters of the year partly reflect an overstatement of hours
growth in the first quarter and the subsequent understatement in the
second quarter.2 This pattern also affected hourly compensation
growth. Nonfarm hourly compensation rose 0.8 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter after a jump of 6.1 percent in the first
quarter. However, over the four quarters ended in 1994:Q2, nonfarm
hourly compensation was up 3 percent--down from an increase of
3.8 percent over the same period of a year ago.
Our most recent data indicate little change in wage trends.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.2 percent in August and, over the past twelve months, were up
2.5 percent.
2. Data from the establishment survey on employment and average
weekly hours are the principal inputs used by the BLS to estimate
total hours worked during the month and quarter. Severe weather
caused the workweek to drop sharply during the February survey week.
Following its usual procedure, the BLS made no adjustment to the hours
estimates in the productivity report to account for the fact that the
survey week was not representative of the month as a whole. However,
in estimating output and total compensation for the first quarter, the
Bureau of Economic Analysis assumed that economic activity returned to
more normal levels for the remainder of February. Thus, the
understatement of growth in first-quarter hours boosted productivity
and hourly compensation. These effects were reversed in the second
quarter.

Industrial Production
Reflecting a large increase in manufacturing output, the
industrial production index rose 0.7 percent in August. Moreover,
the increases for the preceding three months are now reported to be
larger than previously estimated. As a result, the rate of capacity
utilization for total industry has climbed to 84.7 percent--
2.8 percentage points above the 1967-93 average.
In August, higher output of motor vehicles and parts directly
contributed 0.5 percentage point to the 1.0 percent rise in
manufacturing output. Total motor vehicle assemblies increased more
than 1 million units (annual rate) to 12.3 million units. Industry
sources indicate that quicker retooling for the new model year
permitted the rapid August rise in production. Indeed, General
Motors met production schedules despite a strike at a parts plant in
August, and the company reports that it will make up the lost output
of about 200,000 units (annual rate) for affected models in
September.

important contribution came from the continued robust expansion in
the output of business equipment. Production of office and
computing equipment registered a second consecutive monthly increase
of 2.1 percent, while output of industrial equipment expanded
0.6 percent.
In other areas, output growth was lower in August. The index
for household durables edged down after a large increase in July,
and production of consumer nondurable goods excluding energy was
little changed. Utilities output fell 1.3 percent as electricity
usage continued to retreat from an elevated level in June; in
contrast to previous months, this August was a bit cooler than
average. Output of construction supplies remained flat, and mining
production fell for the second straight month.
Because of the surge in August production, as well as revisions
to estimated growth in the preceding three months, the factory
operating rate reached 84.3 percent. Most of the recent rise
occurred in advanced-processing industries, whose utilization rate
climbed to 82.8 percent. The utilization rate in primary-
processing industries turned up as well in August, to 87.7 percent,
after having edged lower in the preceding two months. The pressures
on capacity were mirrored in purchasing managers' reports on vendor
performance in August, which the NAPM reported to be the worst since
mid-1988.
Prices
Higher rates of capacity utilization have exerted discernible
upward pressure on prices at earlier stages of production. Producer
prices of intermediate materials other than food and energy rose
0.5 percent in August and have risen at about a 6 percent annual
rate during the past three months. Materials with especially large
increases in recent months include metals, chemicals, and paper.

The increases in metals prices likely reflect not only the recent
increases in operating rates in these industries but also the
recovery in activity in other industrialized countries that has
contributed to rising global metals prices. Chemicals prices also
have been affected by the run-up in crude-oil prices.
Spot commodity prices also have increased generally since the
last Greenbook. Most industrial materials posted further large
increases--copper, aluminum, zinc, and tin prices were all up more
than 4 percent--although scrap steel prices declined in recent weeks
after large increases prior to that. Corn and wheat prices also
increased significantly in recent weeks. Although corn prices
remained well below their spring levels, wheat prices have more than
offset their declines this summer. Coffee prices have been
extremely volatile in recent weeks; however, their average so far in
September is not much different from that of July.
Recent developments in intermediate materials prices may exert
upward pressure on finished goods prices in the coming months, but
past experience indicates that the extent of pass-through from
materials prices to prices of finished goods can vary greatly
(chart). Little pass-through was apparent when materials prices
accelerated in 1983 and 1984 during the beginning of the expansion.
That episode illustrates that accelerating materials prices may give
false signals about subsequent changes in finished goods prices,
particularly when utilization is relatively low. Econometric
evidence suggests that the pass-through tends to be more pronounced
when the economy is operating at high levels of utilization (shaded
areas); however, that result was far more apparent in the late 1970s
than the late 1980s.
The PPI for finished goods rose 0.6 percent in August, the
largest monthly increase since October 1990. In addition to another

jump in energy prices, prices of finished foods registered a
0.7 percent increase. The PPI for finished goods other than food
and energy rose 0.4 percent in August, following two months of no
change. Price increases were especially large for light motor
vehicles and a variety of nondurable consumer items, including
tobacco products and cosmetics.
The twelve-month change in the PPI for finished goods other
than food and energy increased from 0.5 percent in July to
1.9 percent in August. This increase, however, was mostly the
result of the 25 percent decline of tobacco prices in August 1993,
which has now dropped out of the twelve-month percent change.
Excluding food, energy, and tobacco, the most recent twelve-month
change in prices of finished goods was 1.8 percent, up a bit from
the 1.6 percent pace in the previous twelve-month period.3
Despite significant upward pressure on prices at earlier stages
of processing, inflation at the consumer level has only increased
modestly. The consumer price index has risen a little faster of
late, posting increases of 0.3 percent for three months running--
including August. The recent edging up of CPI inflation has been
led by some solid increases in energy and certain food and service
prices.
Retail energy prices rose 1.4 percent in August, the second
consecutive large increase. The recent increases in energy prices
primarily reflect the pass-through of higher crude oil prices (the
posted price of a barrel of West Texas intermediate rose from $13.50
in March to $18.50 in July.) Since late July, however, crude oil
prices have reversed some of their earlier increase, and the

was spread over August and September of 1993. As these declines drop
out of the twelve-month change in the CPI excluding food and energy in
September, that index will be boosted by 0.1 percentage point.

Lundberg survey for early September suggests that an easing in
retail energy prices has already begun.
The CPI for food rose 0.4 percent in August. Coffee prices
posted another large gain as the huge increases in spot prices
continued to be passed on to the consumer level. Excluding coffee
prices, retail food prices were up only 0.1 percent last month,
continuing the moderate trend evident since the beginning of the
year.
Prices of consumer goods other than food and energy fell
slightly in August. The decline was concentrated in the volatile
apparel category; in other categories, consumer goods prices rose
0.2 percent. Prices of services other than energy rose 0.4 percent
in August, following four months of 0.2 percent increases. Owners'
equivalent rent posted a second consecutive 0.4 percent increase,
following three months of more modest increases: tenants' rent also
was up 0.4 percent in August. Nonetheless, the twelve-month changes
in these series remain at 3-1/4 percent (owners' rent) and
2-1/2 percent (tenants' rent), the same as their twelve-month
changes a year ago. Medical services prices rose 0.4 percent for
the fourth consecutive month. Over the past twelve months, medical
fees increased 5.0 percent, down from 6.4 percent in the previous
twelve-month period.
Motor Vehicles Sales
Sales of new light vehicles rebounded in August to a
15.5 million unit annual rate (FR seasonals), with increases in
purchases of autos and light trucks. The recent strength reflects
both a temporary boost from heavy incentives on Japanese makes and

correct for problems in the BEA seasonal factors that do not
accurately account for variations in the reporting periods used by
automakers.

some easing of the supply constraints that had held down sales of
domestic nameplates since the first quarter.
Among Big Three makes, an improved supply of light vehicles
permitted rebounds in sales of autos and light trucks after downward
trends since the beginning of the year (chart, top panel).
Confidential data from GM and Ford on automobile sales indicate that
the rebound occurred in fleet sales, which are primarily made to
rental car companies (chart, bottom panel). When faced with limited
supplies of vehicles earlier this year, automakers apparently denied
vehicles to their captive rental car companies and now are meeting
rental car demand with the newly available supply. Furthermore, the
addition of third shifts at two plants producing pickup trucks and
sports utility vehicles began to alleviate supply constraints in
that segment of the market, allowing sales to edge up in August.
The latest reading on car buying attitudes from the Michigan
SRC survey shows more positive consumer sentiments. Fewer consumers
expressed concerns that past and expected interest rate hikes will
choke off the recovery. In September, the preliminary estimate of
consumers' appraisals of car buying conditions jumped nearly
6 percent, reaching its highest level since April.
Given the high level of demand since the turn of the year,
domestic automakers have been able to raise prices of cars and light
trucks 4 and 5 percent, respectively, as measured by the PPI during
the twelve months ended in August. Moreover, the continued
appreciation of the yen has boosted Japanese prices and raised the
BLS import price index for autos 5 percent during the twelve-month
period ended in July.
Personal Income and Consumption
Nominal retail sales increased 0.8 percent in August, boosted
by a sharp rebound in sales of durable goods from a weak July.

Spending in the retail control category increased 0.6 percent in
August, the same rate as the upward-revised estimate in July.
Factoring in the latest CPI data, real consumption of goods
excluding motor vehicles is estimated to have risen 0.4 percent in
August to a level 4.8 percent (annual rate) above the second-quarter
average: The latest increase maintains the brisk pace that has
prevailed since early 1993.
The fastest growing subcategory of spending on nonauto goods
during this period has been durables, particularly furniture and
household equipment. Historically, growth in spending on furniture
and household equipment has tended to track growth in home sales,
Although growth in home sales leveled off during the first half of
this year, it remained high relative to a year ago (figure, bottom
panel). Thus, growth in spending on these household durables has
also remained high.
Real disposable income remained on a solid upward trend through
July. However, judging from the most recent labor market report,
wage and salary growth for August is likely to be below the pace of
the first half of the year. The modest upward trend in interest
income attributable to rising interest rates is likely to provide
only a slight offset.
Measures of consumer attitudes have been relatively stable
recently. The Michigan index of sentiment edged up in the first
half of September, according to preliminary results. The increase
reflected mixed changes in assessments of current and prospective
conditions; improved expectations about future conditions (an
official cyclical leading indicator) offset less positive appraisals
of current conditions (chart, top panel). Both the Michigan and the
Conference Board indexes have been fluctuating near, but slightly
below, their post-recession peaks.

Housing Markets
Most indicators of housing demand eased a bit further during
the intermeeting period, but single-family construction was
surprisingly resilient.
Single-family starts edged down 3 percent in August to
1.17 million units (annual rate). Nonetheless, as in July, the
level was close to the second-quarter average of 1.19 million units.
Permit issuance for single-family projects corroborates the recent
leveling off in starts. Prior to these most recent readings,
single-family construction had been trending down with the rise in
mortgage interest rates that began late last year; the monthly
pattern, however, was obscured by last winter's severe weather.
The strength of single-family production during the summer
months is at odds with most other indicators, which have been
pointing to a further softening of housing demand. New-home sales
in June and July averaged 17 percent below the high of last year's
fourth quarter, and the level of sales suggests that demand is not
sufficient to support the recent rate of production. Sales of
existing homes are down as well. These data on softening sales
volumes are corroborated by assessments of market conditions by
builders and lenders, as recorded in industry surveys through early
September (chart, middle and bottom panels). Consumer homebuying
attitudes, on the other hand, have improved in recent months.
The weakening of demand has yet to show through in prices,
which by most measures have continued to increase at about a 3-to-4
percent annual rate for the nation as a whole. Rising construction
costs, however, may be offsetting the effects of reduced demand.
Although lumber prices have been flat in recent weeks, they are
about 7 percent above even the elevated level of a year earlier.
Costs of plywood and most other building materials rose further in

August and, like lumber, have increased more rapidly during the past
year than have prices in general. Construction labor costs, by
contrast, continue to rise only slowly, except for some skilled
trades in scattered local markets.
In the multifamily sector, starts rose in both July and August.
These increases regained most of the ground lost by the sharp drop
in June, which had followed a surge in May. Permit issuance for
these projects moved to a higher level during the summer--added
evidence that this segment of the market is beginning to recover
from its depressed levels of the past several years. Continued high
vacancies and soft rents argue against a sharp rebound, however, and
production for the foreseeable future should remain less than half
the peak levels reached in the mid-1980s.
The federal income tax credit for construction or
rehabilitation of rental housing for low-income households, which
was reauthorized a year ago,5 is often cited as a key cause of
the recent strengthening in multifamily construction; however, our
estimates suggest that the actual influence of the credit has been
quite modest. First, the equity injected into apartment
construction through the tax credits is small relative to the size
of the market, owing in part to statutory caps on the amount of
credits that can be issued annually and to the costs of syndicating
the credits. Second, some of the construction projects to which the
credits are assigned would have gone forward even without the
credit. And third, even if the tax credits tipped the scales in
favor of some projects, the resulting increased housing supply would
5. The tax credit is a reduction in federal tax liability each year
for ten years for owners of, and investors in, low-income rental
housing. Credits are available for new construction or rehabilitation
of existing properties and are based on development costs, the number
of qualifying low-income housing units, and ceilings on state issuance
of credits. For new construction, up to 70 percent of the development
costs (excluding land expenses and architectural and other
professional fees) are available for tax credits.

tend to lower rents in the local market and thus deter unsubsidized
projects.
One factor buoying the national housing statistics this year
has been a turnaround in the California economy. Housing
construction in the state continued to decline in 1992 and 1993.
even as the nation overall was recovering from the recession
(chart). Last year, California accounted for only 7 percent of the
nation's residential construction, down from an 18 percent share as
recently as 1986. This year, building has increased, house prices
have stabilized in several large metro areas, and sales of existing
homes statewide in the second quarter jumped 24 percent from a year
earlier. But, despite the turnaround, California's homebuilding
performance this year falls short of most other states in the
booming West (bottom panel).
Business Fixed Investment
The limited data available for the third quarter are consistent
with the view that growth of real business fixed investment, though
still strong, has been slowing during 1994 after the sharp advance
in 1993. In July. nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense
capital goods were down. On the other hand, unfilled orders
increased in July, business purchases of motor vehicles improved in
August, and indicators of third-quarter construction activity were
up slightly.
Looking at the fundamental determinants of capital spending,
increases in long-term interest rates caused the cost of capital for
equipment excluding computers to rise in the second quarter for the
first time in three years (chart). The cost of capital for
computers continued to decline, although at a much less dramatic

pace than in recent years.6  In addition, the "accelerator
effect," proxied by the eight-quarter change in output growth,
waned. The growth of cash flow through midyear, on the other hand,
was still solid.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft)--
office and computing equipment as well as other equipment--declined
about 2 percent in July, offsetting June advances. Nevertheless,
shipments of both types of capital goods in July were still roughly
at their average levels for the second quarter. New orders also
declined in July. Bookings for office and computing equipment
advanced 0.4 percent, but this gain was more than offset by a
4.2 percent decline in orders for other capital goods.
Nevertheless, orders for nondefense capital goods remained at a high
level in July relative to shipments. Thus, the already sizable
orders backlog continued to grow.
Rising sales of motor vehicles boosted capital spending
significantly in the first quarter, but sales dropped off in the
second quarter. The fluctuations in fleet sales of light vehicles,
which were discussed earlier, accounted for this pattern. Light
vehicle sales turned up in August, as did sales of heavy-weight
trucks. The continuing strength in demand for heavy trucks has
stretched industry capacity and motivated truck manufacturers to
bring new capacity on line in the fall.
Turning to nonresidential structures, construction put in place
increased 1.1 percent in July, after climbing 5.8 percent in the
second quarter. On a six-month moving average basis, construction
continues to trend up at about the same rate as in 1993 despite
6. In addition to higher interest rates, a large part of the change
is attributable to a slowing in the rate of decline of computer
prices. As discussed in detail in the August Greenbook, this slowing
appears to be the result of a poorly constructed sample for the
producer price index for computers that is the basis for the BEA's PDE
deflator.

being hit hard by winter weather in the first quarter. Outlays for
all construction categories, except lodging, showed strong to
moderate gains.
Several recent key indicators of commercial construction
activity were consistent with the view that conditions are
improving. The National Real Estate Index (NREI), showed increases
in prices over the past year for retail structures and office
buildings. Given the huge declines in prices for office buildings
witnessed in recent years, these increases were a significant
departure. An alternative measure of office prices--the Russell-
NCREIF index--has shown some signs of leveling off. Moreover, the
Russell-NCREIF index of nominal rental income for U.S. office
properties began to inch up in the second quarter. The FDIC's
August survey of Real Estate was also upbeat. Nationwide, 89
percent of the bank examiners and liquidators responding to the
survey believed that prices of commercial real estate were either
holding steady or increasing at the beginning of the third quarter,
up from 74 percent at the same time last year and a low of
54 percent in early 1992. Another indication of improving
conditions was the decline of vacancy rates. Both downtown and
suburban vacancy rates continued to edge down in the second quarter.
These rates have come down sharply over the past two years--from
around 20 percent to roughly 16 percent--and vacancy rates are now
at their lowest level in three years.
In the natural gas industry, exploration has leveled off
lately, but industry analysts view this development as a temporary
lull. Exploration activity is apparently being scaled back in
response to the recent decline in natural gas spot prices. Most
analysts believe, however, that these price declines reflect
transitory developments--such as the mild summer--that reduced

demand. In the longer run, demand for natural gas and renewed
exploration are expected to be bouyed by. among other things, the
Clean Air Act, which has induced many utilities to switch to gas-
fired plants.
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
Overall business inventory accumulation slowed markedly in
July, as a sizable drawdown in retail inventories offset part of the
increase in manufacturing and wholesale stocks. For all
manufacturing and trade, inventories rose at a $28.8 billion annual
rate in current-cost terms in July compared with a second-quarter
pace of $75.7 billion. A substantial portion of the July
accumulation was in stocks of producer goods; in contrast, the
backup during May and June occurred in stocks of consumer goods in
the retail sector. The inventory-sales ratio for all manufacturing
and trade moved up somewhat in July, as total shipments and sales
fell 0.8 percent. Nonetheless, at 1.42 months, the ratio remained
toward the middle of the range posted over the past year.
By major sector, the inventory situation was quite varied.
Manufacturers' inventory investment accelerated in July; factory
stocks rose at a $39.6 billion annual rate in current-cost terms--
nearly triple the second-quarter pace. The July run-up was
accompanied by a 1.6 percent drop in factory shipments, and the
manufacturers' inventory-shipments ratio showed an unusually steep
one-month rise, from 1.38 to 1.41 months.
More specifically, industry detail shows that more than half of
the July accumulation of manufacturing inventories was in stocks of
materials, supplies, and work-in-process, or in finished goods
inventories held in materials-producing industries. Our judgment is
that these accumulations were mainly associated with planned
increases in production, with concerns about lengthening order lead

times and rising prices also playing a role. Among other finished
goods, the largest buildup was in stocks of capital goods
(industrial machinery, business equipment, and aircraft).
A similar pattern emerged in the recent buildup of wholesale
inventories, which expanded substantially in July and over the
second quarter. As in manufacturing, a sizable portion of the
wholesale inventory accumulation in recent months consisted of
stocks of producer durables--machinery, business equipment, metals,
and so on. The net increase in nondurable stocks in the wholesale
sector was small in recent months.
In contrast, retail inventories declined in July, falling at a
$32.2 billion annual rate. The decline was predominantly in
automotive inventories and general merchandise stocks. The drawdown
of general merchandise stocks in July, together with a 0.4 percent
increase in sales, sharply reduced the inventory-sales ratio for
this type of retail establishment. At 2.28 months in July, the
ratio was near the low end of the range observed over the past year.
Federal Sector
NIPA revisions for the second quarter of 1994 show that real
federal government purchases decreased at an annual rate of
8.8 percent, rather than the 5 percent reduction reported in the
advance estimates. The change occurred mostly in nondefense
purchases, which are now estimated to have fallen at an annual rate
of 14 percent--twice the advance report estimate of 7 percent. BEA
attributes the revision to a relabeling of certain transactions from
nondefense purchases to grants, rather than a reduction in total
government spending. Total spending was actually revised up
$3.7 billion.
The unified budget deficit for the fiscal year through July was
$183 billion, 24 percent less than for the same period in fiscal

1993. The lower deficit reflects both a sizable increase in
receipts and restrained growth. In particular, outlays (excluding
deposit insurance) have increased only 0.7 percent this fiscal year,
restrained by declines in defense and other discretionary spending.
July outlays decreased 4 percent from last year's level because July
1993 had "double" pay dates (that is, five Fridays) that boosted
defense and income security outlays. After accounting for this
effect, outlays grew about 1 percent. Moreover, medicare and health
spending, though up 9 percent this fiscal year over the same period
last year, has grown significantly more slowly than during the 1990-
1992 period.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released revised deficit
estimates in August. In The Economic and Budget Outlook: An Update.
the CBO projects a deficit of $202 billion for FY1994, $18 billion
below the Administration's forecast. The bulk of the difference
between deficit estimates is in their outlay projections. Data for
the first ten months of FY1994 clearly are more consistent with the
CBO estimate.
The CBO five-year forecast anticipates that the deficit will
decline to $162 billion in 1995 but then rise to $231 billion in
1999. The Administration projects a deficit of $207 billion in
1999. The Administration's lower deficit forecast is primarily
attributable to differences in assumptions about real GDP growth.
The Administration shows growth of 2.5 percent per year for the last
three years of the decade, while CBO assumes growth closer to
2.1 percent.
The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
authorizes $30.2 billion over the next six years. The funding comes
from reductions in federal employment, and the act is supposed to be
deficit neutral. Most spending in the crime bill will be state and

II-49
local grants, although it also includes a small reallocation of
federal purchases.
State and Local Government Sector
Real spending on state and local government structures
increased 2.0 percent in July to a level more than 3 percent above
the second-quarter average. Most of the recent strength occurred in
construction of water and sewer facilities and "other buildings," a
category that includes a wide range of government buildings, such as
offices, courtrooms, and prisons. Nevertheless, construction
outlays remain below the high reached in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Meanwhile, employment in state and local governments during
July and August averaged only slightly above the second-quarter
level. Employment at local government educational establishments
(the largest subgroup) continued to rise; state education jobs also
expanded. However, these gains were largely offset by reductions in
employment in other local government operations. On a year-over-
year basis, growth of state and local government employment--at
1-1/2 percent in August--remained at the reduced pace that has
prevailed for the past two years.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The half-point hike in the discount and federal funds rates
implemented in the wake of the August FOMC meeting outstripped
market expectations, and other money market yields firmed in
response. Major commercial banks promptly followed the System
action, raising the prime rate 1/2 percentage point, to 7-3/4
percent.
The press release announcing the August policy moves was widely
interpreted as indicating that subsequent action was on hold, at
least for a few months, and longer-term rates initially fell
somewhat. But, later in the intermeeting period, in light of data
suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures might be greater
than previously thought, long rates more than reversed their earlier
declines. On balance, these rates have risen 15 to 40 basis points
since the FOMC meeting. Corporate bond rates generally moved up in
line with Treasury yields. Despite the rise in interest rates.
however, major stock indexes rose between 1 and 5 percent over the
intermeeting period.
The monetary aggregates declined in August after growing
moderately in July, and they appear to be stabilizing in September.
Smoothing through monthly movements, the aggregates have remained
sluggish, mostly reflecting the effect of the rise of market yields
relative to deposit rates. The lack of a sustained improvement in
the bond markets has continued to encourage businesses to rely
heavily on bank loans and commercial paper for credit. Merger
transactions and stock repurchases have been absorbing more equity
shares than are being issued. State and local governments also have
trimmed long-term borrowings but have maintained issuance of short-
term debt. Net federal borrowing has risen this quarter owing to a
seasonal expansion of the budget deficit. Home mortgage lending

activity appears to have rebounded in the third quarter from its
surprisingly weak second-quarter pace. Consumer credit demand was
down only a touch in July, and consumer loan growth at banks
remained strong in August.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 declined at a 2 percent pace in August, following a strong
July gain, but preliminary data indicate that the outflow ceased in
early September. The runoff in August reflected weakness in most of
the aggregate's liquid components: Demand and other checkable
deposits declined, which together reversed most of their July
increase, while outflows from savings deposits accelerated.
Despite monthly fluctuations, M2, on balance, has hovered near
the lower bound of its growth cone in the third quarter. Its slow
growth has reflected increasing opportunity costs on most of its
components. Historically, yields on OCDs and savings (including
MMDAs) have adjusted quite slowly to changes in market rates
(chart). As opportunity costs rise, depositors who are more rate
sensitive move balances from these accounts to small time deposits
and money market mutual funds, whose rates are more closely tied to
market rates. However, yields on small time deposits appear to be
adjusting more slowly in this episode than the norm, probably
prompting some depositors to more actively shift out of M2 and into
other investments.
These shifts seem to be bypassing bond mutual funds to a large
extent, although inflows to stock funds have been robust. Bond
funds posted outflows in July and likely in August. Some investors
apparently acquired securities directly, as evidenced by the
$4 billion increase in net noncompetitive tenders in August (chart).
M3 contracted at a 2 percent pace last month, which left the
aggregate near the lower bound of its annual growth range. Large

time deposits expanded briskly, as they have since May. This
renewed growth partly reflects banks' use of wholesale rather than
retail liabilities to fund credit growth. In addition, some of the
growth in large time deposits may owe to banks' efforts to replace
Treasury deposits, which have declined nearly $20 billion
(seasonally adjusted) from their recent high during the tax period
in April.
Bank credit expanded at a 5 percent rate in August, off from
its rapid July pace. Much of the deceleration reflected a
contraction in securities. Although loan growth also dropped a bit,
it still was strong at a 10-1/4 percent annual rate. Consumer loans
grew briskly. Real estate loans accelerated, partly owing to the
acquisition by banks of thrift assets. Some of the faster growth
also may be the result of increased issuance of adjustable rate
mortgages, which banks are more apt to hold than fixed-rate
mortgages and which are typically securitized. In addition, data
from the second quarter call report indicate a modest pickup in
commercial real estate lending at medium- and small-sized banks:
credit extended in this market may still be boosting real estate
loan growth.
Business loan growth slowed somewhat in August but nonetheless
proceeded at nearly a 10 percent rate. Banks reportedly have been
more aggressive in making such loans, and the most recent Survey of
Terms of Bank Lending found that the interest rate spreads on small-
and medium-sized business loans over the federal funds rate fell
between May and August. Expanding external financing needs and a
shift from bond markets appear to have boosted demands for short-
and intermediate-term credit.

Business Finance
Nonfinancial firms continued to find long-term financing
opportunities less attractive, and gross issuance of stocks and
bonds remained sluggish in August and early September. Junk bond
offerings were few and small; issuance of investment-grade debt was
somewhat better maintained, but the average pace of offerings in
July and August was still off by almost 50 percent from the first
half of the year. On the equity side, gross public issuance,
including initial public offerings, slackened in July and continued
to be weak in August. Although some of this weakness may have owed
to the summer holiday season, the calendar of issues slated for
September does not suggest a significant pickup in the pace of
equity offerings.
For financial corporations, bond issuance rose in August,
owing to a surge in offerings of asset-backed securities. Because
they have short maturities and often offer floating interest rates,
asset-backed securities have found particular favor among investors
seeking protection from rising interest rates.
There was considerable activity on the merger and acquisition
front over the intermeeting period, and estimates suggest that the
volume could top $85 billion this year (chart). The pickup has been
primarily driven by a surge in megamergers (transactions with a
total sales price of $1 billion or more). The total value of
megamergers completed this year already is higher than in any of the
previous three years, and the calendar of proposed megamergers is
heavy. In one merger of note, Martin Marietta and Lockheed recently
announced plans to combine in a deal, valued at $8.8 billion, that
is scheduled to close in early 1995.
Merger activity thus far this year has been concentrated in a
few industries--principally media and telecommunications, health

care. chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and defense. For the most
part, the mergers have been motivated either by technological
synergies or by the need to consolidate in response to changed
demand conditions. The mergers have been financed to a large extent
by stock swaps rather than by cash and debt. This financing pattern
contrasts with the experience of the 1980s, which was the heyday of
the leveraged buyout (chart). Because a high proportion of recent
merger activity has been financed through stock swaps, the impact of
this activity on equity retirements is less than in the 1980s.
However, looking forward, the crowded calendar will involve merger-
related retirements of equity that, when added to share repurchases,
likely will keep net equity issuance negative next year.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt fell to about
$11 billion in August. as the volume of refunding dropped to $1-1/2
billion, its lowest level since early 1991. For the first eight
months of this year, long-term issuance is down about 40 percent
from the same period in 1993, with the decline due entirely to a
dropoff in refunding activity. The limited amount of long-term
issuance, along with heavy retirements, suggests that outstanding
long-term tax-exempt debt has declined thus far this year. Since
1952, net issuance of such debt has been negative in only two
quarters and has never been negative over an entire year. The
reduced supply has helped to hold down yields on municipal
securities relative to those on Treasuries.
Meanwhile, gross issuance of short-term tax-exempt debt was a
hefty $6 billion in August after even heavier issuance in June and
July. A large volume of short-term issuance might appear surprising
in light of the improved financial positions of most state and local
governments, which suggests less need to cover gaps in cash flows.

III-11
In fact, the recent pickup in short-term issuance has not kept pace
with retirements in this maturity sector as well and is consistent
with some decline in the stock of outstanding short-term debt.

Treasury Financing
The Treasury will likely finance the projected third-quarter
fiscal deficit of $49-1/2 billion mainly by borrowing $31 billion
from the public and by drawing down its cash balance. Nonmarketable
borrowing is expected to turn negative owing to a large paydown in
state and local government series (SLGS) as a consequence of the
sharp falloff in advance refunding.
The Treasury announced sharp cutbacks in the sizes of its
weekly bill auctions in advance of its expected large inflows on the
September 15 tax date. These actions surprised market participants
somewhat, in light of the Treasury's intention, announced in May
1993, to shorten the maturity of the public debt. In practice,
though, the Treasury has shortened its average maturity by issuing

more one-year bills and two-year notes and fewer longer-term
securities. Nonetheless, on the whole, the average maturity of the
public debt maturity had decreased only modestly by early this
year (chart).
The Treasury's decision to move to a semiannual auction
schedule for the thirty-year bond has had a noticeable effect on the
bond's yield in relation to the rest of the term structure.
Typically, on-the-run, or the most recently issued, securities have
liquidity value, which is capitalized into their price, lowering
their yield compared to off-the-run securities. Given the change in
the issuance cycle, liquidity premiums on thirty-year bonds are
capitalized for six months rather than for three months under the
old schedule, implying a higher price and lower yield. Because the
Treasury's estimates of constant-maturity yields are based on the
on-the-run securities, these widely reported yields include such
liquidity effects. Moreover, the Treasury's calculation of
constant-maturity yields makes no adjustment for changes in
duration, thereby overstating the extent of interest rate changes,
Board staff estimates of constant-maturity yields, which remove such
liquidity and duration effects, suggest that the impact can be
substantial at times (chart). Over this intermeeting period,
however, the wedge has not been significant, as the on-the-run
thirty-year bond incorporates little liquidity value.
Mortgage Markets
Since the last FOMC meeting, the yield spread between the
conventional fixed-rate thirty-year mortgage and comparable Treasury
securities is about unchanged, but the spread on adjustable-rate
mortgages over the one-year Treasury bill has narrowed 16 basis
points (chart). Portfolio lenders have continued to price ARMs
aggressively, to the point where the ARM-to-Treasury rate spread on

III-16
recently closed mortgages has turned negative; the ARM rate on new
lending, of course, reflects start rates that may be initially set
low to entice borrowers but that adjust upward over time.
Partial data for the third quarter indicate that mortgage
lending activity has picked up from an unusually weak second quarter
pace. Real estate loan growth at commercial banks has been notably
strong, in part reflecting the relative strength of ARM financing.
Mortgage loan growth at thrifts in the second quarter turned
positive for the first time in over a year and is expected also to
pick up further in the current period. While the Mortgage Bankers
Association purchase application index declined on a seasonally
adjusted basis from its level in the second quarter, much of the
weakness is likely attributable to a shift of originations from
mortgage companies to banks and thrifts. The ARM share of
conventional mortgage originations remained above 40 percent,
according to the Federal Housing Finance Board, and depositories are
more active than are mortgage bankers in this sector of the market.
Gross issuance of pass-throughs by the agencies declined to
about $19-1/2 billion in August, the lowest monthly volume since
April 1991. Net issuance also has been relatively weak recently,
totaling only $6-1/2 billion in June and $8 billion in July,
substantially below January's $17 billion. One reason for the
decline in issuance is that lenders typically hold the bulk of the
ARMs that they originate in portfolio. Even so. agencies appear to
be participating in the increase in ARM originations. So far in
1994, total ARM-backed securities issuance has jumped 28 percent
above the same period as last year, and the agency sector has
accounted for about 85 percent of all new ARM-backed securities
issued thus far in 1994. The limited new supply of pass-through
securities coupled with generally lower rate volatility have

III-17
contributed to relatively tight spreads between mortgage securities
and Treasuries in secondary markets.
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit increased at an 8 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, half its June pace.
However, this deceleration was overstated by the reclassification of
about $2 billion of loans at one large finance company, formerly
reported as "other consumer loans." which trimmed about 3 percentage
points from the growth of total installment credit in July.
Interest rates on consumer loans at commercial banks increased
over the period from May to August. The average "most common" rate
on a forty-eight-month new-car loan rose about 60 basis points to
8.4 percent. Rates on two-year personal loans and credit card plans
also rose, but by lesser amounts. The spread of the auto loan rate
against three-year Treasuries widened a bit in August but remained
well below the average of the past ten years (chart). Spreads on
personal loan rates and credit card rates were little changed and
remained near their ten-year averages.
Credit quality of commercial bank consumer loans improved,
based on data reported on the second-quarter call report.
Delinquency rates on all types of consumer loans edged down; the
largest decline occurred for credit card loans. Delinquency rates
at large banks were sharply lower, while those at small banks were
up slightly. The American Bankers Association series on delinquency
rates also indicated declines in rates for five types of closed-end
consumer loans and for credit cards.

Exports of goods and services in July dropped back to levels
recorded in April and May, and were 1 percent less than the second-
quarter average. One part of the decline in exports was transitory.
Aircraft exports were low for seasonal reasons in July and are
expected to have rebounded in August. Similarly, exports of
automotive products to Canada dropped in July (as did imports of
automotive products from Canada). Another part of the decline
reflected a drop back from the comparatively high levels recorded in
June: exports of machinery and consumer goods were less than in
June, nonetheless, they were still higher than in either of the two
preceding months. Agricultural exports (primarily soybeans)
declined in July to about the second-quarter average level. On the
other hand, exports of nonagricultural industrial supplies
(especially chemicals) increased strongly in both June and July.

and was 2 percent higher than the second-quarter average. In July.
small increases in imported oil, other industrial supplies, and
automotive products from Japan were offset by declines in imported
aircraft, consumer goods, and automotive products from Canada.
In the second quarter the trade deficit was larger than in the
first quarter and significantly larger than at any time since 1988
Exports of goods and services were 4 percent higher than in the
first quarter; increases occurred in both goods and services with
the sharpest rises recorded for machinery, industrial supplies
(particularly chemicals, aluminum, and paper), and travel and
transportation receipts from foreigners. Imports of goods and
services rose 5 percent; the increase was spread about evenly over
most categories of merchandise. The exception was imported oil
whose value jumped nearly 25 percent.
The quantity of oil imported in July (10 million barrels per
day) eased only slightly from the record high levels in June. The
strength of imports in June was associated with increased
consumption of oil that accompanied the onset of the summer driving
season. In July, imports remained strong as inventories rose at a
quicker pace while production eased. Preliminary Department of
Energy statistics indicate that in August consumption of oil rose
slightly, inventories continued to be rebuilt, and imports fell
somewhat but remained over 9 mb/d.
Prices of Merchandise Imports and Exports
The price of imported oil continued its upward trend in July
rising another $1.00 per barrel to reach $16.62 per barrel. While
the $1.00 rise in June prices occurred as OPEC production remained
roughly unchanged in the face of increasing world oil demand, the
onset of the Nigerian oil workers unions strike on July 4 pushed the

closing spot oil prices (West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) fell as low
as $16.70 per barrel (the lowest levels since April) as concern over
Nigerian production disruption abated and the unions suspended their
strike (September 5). Currently, spot WTI is trading at $17.17 per
barrel. Import prices in August and September should follow this
fall in spot and futures prices; import prices are expected to be
above $16.00 per barrel in August, and to average about $15.25 per
barrel in September.
Prices of non-oil imports rose in July for the fifth
consecutive month. The sharpest increase in July, as in June, was
for imported coffee, the price of which jumped 60 percent in two
months. Other than for foods, import price increases in recent
months were strongest for industrial supplies followed by capital
goods other than computers. Prices of imported automotive products
which increased earlier in the year did not rise much in June or
July. While prices of imported consumer goods have varied within a
small range this year, in recent months increases have occurred more
often than declines.
Price increases of nonagricultural exports have moved up
during the year, with the sharpest increases in recent months
recorded for nonagricultural industrial supplies (especially paper).
Only small price changes were reported for exported consumer goods,
automotive products, and capital goods other than computers in
recent months, Prices of agricultural exports declined in July
(primarily soybeans and corn) as they did in June (largely wheat).
Price data for August will be released by BLS on September 29.
U.S. Current Account through 1994-02
The U.S. current account deficit was $147.9 billion SAAR in
the second quarter, $18.6 billion larger than in the first quarter.

The deficit for net goods and services widened as an increase
in net receipts from service transactions (largely from foreign
travelers in the United States, especially for World Cup Soccer) was
more than offset by an increase in the deficit for merchandise trade
(imports increased more than exports rose).

Both payments and receipts of investment income rose sharply
in Q2, with income payments on foreign assets in the United States
increasing more than income receipts from U.S. assets abroad. The
jump in income payments reflected higher interest rates (which
pushed up portfolio payments) as well as higher income payments on
foreign direct investment in the United States. Most of the
increase in income receipts from U.S. assets abroad reflected higher
interest rates and receipt of past due interest payments owed to
U.S. banks by Brazil.
Net unilateral transfers rose marginally in the second
quarter.

IV-8
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States rose
strongly in July for the third straight month (line 1 of the Summary
of U.S. International Transactions table). July's increase was
related only in part to reported foreign exchange-market
intervention by the G-10 countries. Within the G-10, significant
increases were registered by Canada, Japan, and Switzerland, while
outside the G-10 most of the rise was accounted for by Singapore and
the BIS. Mexican reserves in the United States continued to fall.
Banking inflows, at $10.9 billion, also continued at
approximately the same rate as May and June (line 3). About half of
the net inflow was attributable to investment banks and securities
dealers. Daily average data indicate continued inflows in August
from own foreign offices and IBFs (line 1 of the International
Banking Data table).
Private foreigners sold U S. securities net in July, in
contrast to huge net purchases in the the first quarter and
significant net additions in May and June (line 4 of the Summary
table). Holdings of Treasury securities fell by $9 billion in July
(line 4a): much of the international activity in U.S. Treasury
securities in 1994 has been recorded in Caribbean financial centers,
particularly Bermuda, the British West Indies, and the Netherlands
Antilles, and presumably reflects the activities of certain "hedge"
and other investment funds. Net private sales of U.S. Treasury
securities reported for these areas amounted to $12.7 billion in the
second quarter and another $7.5 billion in July.
Corporate and other bond purchases by private foreigners were
almost halved in July to a net $5.8 billion (line 4b); of the total,
about $2.5 billion was for U.S. agency bonds. Small net sales of

corporate stocks continued in July (line 4c). U.S. residents, on
the other hand, continued net purchases of foreign securities at
the moderate rates seen since the beginning of the second quarter
(line 5).
Recently released preliminary data for second-quarter direct
investment capital flows show a substantial falloff of both outflows
and inflows from the very high levels of 1994:Q1 (lines 6 and 7).
In both cases the declines were largely associated with shifts in
accounts receivable and payable between parent firms and affiliates,
reflecting shifting financing decisions. At $7.8 billion for the
quarter, outflows of U.S. direct investment abroad were double the
value of inflows for foreign investment in the United States.
However, net outflows for direct investment declined, from $12.8
billion in the first quarter, to $3.9 billion (line 6 plus line 7).
The preliminary statistical discrepancy was a small negative
$3.5 billion for the second quarter, but the very large revision of
the statistical discrepancy for the first quarter underlines the
"softness" of the preliminary numbers. The revised figure for the
first quarter of negative $14.5 billion represents a $19.2 billion
shift from the preliminary number of $4.7 billion. The primary
causes of the change were revisions in bank claims on own foreign
offices and the receipt of data on the claims and liabilities of
U.S. nonbanks that normally lag by a quarter. The (preliminary)
statistical discrepancy for the first two quarters of 1994 now
stands at a negative $18 billion. When combined with the impact of
currency shipments of approximately $13 billion in the first half
that are unrecorded in the balance of payments, the total of
unrecorded net capital outflows and net imports now stands at $31
billion for the first half of 1994.

Two possible sources of such a sizable discrepancy are the
series on credit extended to and Eurodeposits of U.S. nonbank
residents. As part of recent improvements introduced by BEA in the
U.S. international accounts, BEA is now using data reported to the
BIS as a major source of information on these items. As shown in
lines 4 and 5 of the International Banking Data Table. BEA's data
for these accounts recorded a capital inflow of $6 billion in the
first quarter. Federal Reserve statistical reports present a quite
different picture; as reported on lines 2a and 2b of the same table,
the sum of the differences between the March and December levels of
credit extended to U.S. nonbanks equals a net outflow of $2.7
billion. Further, our independent measures of Eurodollar holdings
(lines 3a plus 3b), total a net outflow of $2.3 billion. Thus,
Federal Reserve figures estimate a capital outflow totaling $5
billion for these items -- a difference that would account for $11
billion of the revised statistical discrepancy in the first quarter,
However, since the coverage of the Federal Reserve series is less
complete than that of the BIS, it is still possible that these
differences do not account for the statistical discrepancy in
1994:Q1.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar,
shown in the chart, declined 1-1/2 percent on balance during the
intermeeting period, with concerns over U.S. inflation apparently
the primary factor contributing to the decline. The dollar rose
shortly after the Federal Reserve tightened monetary conditions on
August 16, but subsequently fell on concerns that the Federal
Reserve was likely to fall behind what was needed to prevent a rise
in U.S. inflation. The dollar rebounded temporarily at the end of
August on U.S. GDP figures for the second quarter that suggested

U.S. economic growth was beginning to slow. In the following weeks,
however, the dollar gave up all of these gains, weakened in part by
figures showing that in August U.S. producer prices, capacity
utilization, and industrial production had all increased by more
than market participants had expected. Toward the end of the
intermeeting period, the dollar weakened against the yen on news of
a widening of the U.S. trade deficit in August and worries about
ongoing trade talks with Japan.
The Canadian dollar rose 2-1/2 percent against the dollar
during the intermeeting period. Most of this rise reflected an
unwinding of concerns that a victory by the separatist Parti
Quebecois in provincial elections on September 16 would lead to
Quebec's eventual secession from Canada. The slim margin of the
Parti Quebecois' popular vote victory supported pre-election polls
showing a substantial majority of Quebec's citizens opposed to
secession.
Sterling rose 2-1/4 percent against the dollar during the
intermeeting period. About half of of this rise occurred after the
Bank of England surprised market participants by raising its money
market intervention rate 1/2 percentage point on September 12.
Strong economic growth and a desire to prevent the emergence of
inflation were cited as the basis for the rate increase. Data
released subsequent to the rate increase suggested U.K. inflation
may be picking up.
Ten-year bellwether bond yields rose 45 basis points in Germany
during the intermeeting period and by 20 to 40 basis points in most
other European countries. These increases followed reports of
strong second-quarter GDP growth in both Germany and the United
Kingdom. A non-trivial portion of the backup in European interest
rates occurred after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S.

economic data, suggesting a common component to concerns about the
pickup in U.S. and European economic activity.
In Japan the ten-year bellwether bond yield declined 10 basis
points, reflecting Japan's weak second quarter economic performance,
as well as low business confidence, which both suggest that the
Japanese economy is recovering at a considerably slower pace than
that in Europe.
While long term interest rates rose in the United States and
Europe during the intermeeting period, the ten year bellwether bond
yield declined 5 basis points in Canada, reflecting an unwinding of
the risk premium that it had developed prior to Quebec's
parliamentary election.
The yield on the bellwether bond in Sweden declined 35 basis
points on balance during the intermeeting period. Prior to
national elections on September 18. the yield declined on market
participants' relief that it appeared a centrist, as opposed to a
far-left, coalition would form the next government. Following the
election, the bellwether bond yield gave up some of its pre-election
gains after the Social Democratic Party indicated that it intends to
form a minority government.
Three-month interest rates rose 10 basis points to 5.00 percent
in Germany during the inter-meeting period. Over the same period,
the Bundesbank conducted all of its RPs at a fixed rate of 4.85
percent. Comments by Bundesbank Council members concerning the
future scope for monetary easing were mixed during the period, but
three-month Euromark futures rates backed up slightly, suggesting
the market expects a slightly accelerated pace of Bundesbank
tightening. The yield on the December 1994 three-month Euromark
futures contract is currently 30 basis points above the current
three-month rate, and the yield on the December 1995 three-month

IV-16
Euromark futures contract is currently 175 basis points above the
current three-month rate. These yields reflect both expectations of
the future path of three-month rates, as well as liquidity and risk
premia.
In Japan, short-term rates remained unchanged at about 2.30
percent during the intermeeting period. Three-month Euroyen futures
rates declined about 10 basis points during the period, with most of
this decline occurring at the end of the period, following the
release of weaker than expected second quarter GDP figures. The
yield on the December 1994 Euroyen futures contract is 20 basis
points above the current three-month rate, and the yield on the
December 1995 Euroyen futures contract is 140 basis points above the
current three-month rate.
The Desk did not intervene
during the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real GDP grew strongly (by 4 percent or more. SAAR) in the
second quarter in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
confirming that recovery is firmly established, but Japanese real
GDP contracted. Components of GDP showed differing patterns of
growth across these economies. In Japan, growth in public
investment and private housing expenditures was offset by weakness
in private consumption and investment spending. In Germany, final
domestic demand contracted and inventory investment surged, while in
France all components of final domestic demand were strong. In the
United Kingdom, government expenditures made an important
contribution to growth, while in Canada a surge in fixed investment
was the primary source of growth. Net exports provided support in
Germany. Canada, and the United Kingdom. but subtracted from growth

in Japan and France. Available data for the third quarter are
mixed, but in general suggest a slight moderation from the rapid
pace of expansion in the second quarter.
Consumer price inflation remains low in major foreign
industrial countries, but in several there has been a pickup in
input prices and producer prices. Unemployment rates have started
to level off or come down, but they remain well above estimated
NAIRUs.
In Japan. after growth of nearly 4 percent (SAAR) in the first
quarter, real GDP declined 1.6 percent in the second quarter, as
consumption expenditures, plant and equipment investment, and net
exports fell. While consumption expenditures are expected to
reverse their decline in the third quarter, reflecting the effects
of tax rebates and unusually hot weather, the second-quarter decline
in economic activity underscores the weak and tentative nature of
the recovery.

Data for the third quarter are mixed, but on balance suggest a
resumption of growth. Industrial production and housing starts
moved up moderately in the second quarter, but they edged down
somewhat in July. New car registrations declined in the second
quarter but rebounded in August. Similarly, new machinery orders

were up strongly in June and July following a second-quarter
decline, on average. Recent movements in the unemployment rate and
the job offers/applicants ratio point to further deterioration in
the labor market.

In the Bank of Japan's August economic survey (Tankan), the
index of business sentiment of major manufacturing firms (the
percentage having a favorable view of business conditions minus the
percentage with an unfavorable outlook) registered its second
consecutive increase after more than four years of decline.
However, sentiment on balance is still negative, and firms predicted
a 4 percent fall in investment in the fiscal year that began in
April, about the same predicted decline as in May's survey.
Real GDP rose 4 percent at an annual rate in western Germany in
the second quarter, nearly twice the first-quarter rate of increase.
In the first quarter, a surge in construction spending (due to mild
winter weather and tax incentives) boosted growth, but in the second
quarter, inventory accumulation was the major source of growth.
Consumption declined substantially, owing partly to the decline in
real disposable income this year. Construction fell, as expected
after the weather-induced surge in the first quarter, while
machinery and equipment investment spending rose for the second

consecutive quarter. Both exports and imports grew strongly, and
net exports made a modest contribution to growth.

In July, industrial production continued to expand (although
the July figure is expected to be revised downward), while the
volume of retail sales fell further, suggesting that inventory
accumulation may have continued into the third quarter. However, a
July survey showed a marked improvement in west German businesses
views concerning finished goods inventories, except in consumer
goods sectors. Increases in manufacturing orders and firms'
production plans in June and July suggest that economic activity is
likely to continue to pick up.

In eastern Germany. industrial production (NSA) has continued
to show strong gains, advancing 21-1/2 percent in the year ending in
June. led by basic and producer goods, which were up nearly 30
percent. Manufacturing orders (NSA) also have evidenced strong
gains recently, and are up more than 15 percent for the year ending
in June.
In France, real GDP rose 4 percent (SAAR) in the second
quarter. Growth was broad based with consumption, investment, and
total domestic demand all expanding at a 4 percent annual rate The
strength in consumption is partly due to government subsidies on
automobile purchases (which rose almost 33 percent, SAAR). These
incentives appear to have had most of their impact early in the
quarter, as the consumption of manufactured products, which includes
autos, declined in May and was almost flat in June.

be larger due to deficits in the social security budget and at the

A sharp drop in oil production in July resulted in flat
industrial production despite a pickup in manufacturing production.
Retail sales expanded in July, but fell back in August, with the end
of summer discounting by retailers. Rising input prices contributed

to an increase in producer price inflation in August, after declines
in the previous seven months.

In the first change in monetary policy since February, the
government set a minimum lending rate of 5.75 percent on September
12 that resulted in a 50 basis-point rise in base lending rates.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke stated that the rate
increase was in response to the strong and rapid pickup in growth
and was designed to ensure that no risks were taken with inflation.

Preliminary indicators for the third quarter suggest that
economic activity will continue at a healthy, but more moderate,
pace. Growth in the composite index, Canada's main leading
indicator, slowed in July and August, continuing a trend begun in
May and the volume of retail sales fell in July. Rising commodity
prices and the lower level of the Canadian dollar through August
continued to contribute to industrial-product price inflation, but
so far consumer price inflation remains subdued. Excluding the
effects of recent tax cuts. 12-month consumer price inflation
averaged 1.6 percent in August.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Growth appears strong in major developing economies other than
Venezuela and Russia.
Mexico grew strongly in the second quarter, according to
preliminary statistics released just before the August presidential
election. In Brazil, inflation has fallen under the latest
stabilization plan, which took effect July 1. Price controls in
Venezuela have restrained inflation, and output continues to
contract. In Argentina, growth is steady while inflation has stayed
low. In China, strong growth continues and inflation rates have
risen; strong export growth has pushed the trade balance for the
year into surplus. In Taiwan, consumer prices rose substantially in
August because of bad weather. In Korea, output growth and
inflation have both risen recently. Russian output continues to
fall, but inflation has also fallen: tax revenues are running far
below projections.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, real GDP rose 3.8 percent
in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. This strong
growth was well above the 0.5 percent rise in the first quarter, and
exceeded most private and official forecasts. The surge was
attributed to increases in foreign direct investment and spending on
public infrastructure. These data are preliminary and were released
just before the Mexican presidential elections; hence, their
implications for the strength of the recovery will remain unclear
until revised GDP data are released. Consumer prices rose 6.8
percent in August from a year earlier. The trade deficit in the
first half of 1994 was $8.9 billion, up from $6.9 billion in the
same period last year.

a decisive victory. The wide margin of Zedillo's victory, as well
as the reporting of only scattered, minor electoral irregularities.
largely dispelled concerns that political turmoil would continue to
restrain economic activity even after the elections.
As shown in the following chart on Mexican financial
developments, pressure on the peso eased in the runup to the
presidential election as polls indicated increasing support for the
PRI. By the time of the election, Zedillo's victory had been
largely discounted. Since then, however, pressure on the peso has
increased because of uncertainties related to the renewal within the
next few weeks or months of the annual anti-inflation pact. The
peso/dollar exchange rate has moved closer to the "lower" limit of
its fluctuation band. The rate on one-month peso-denominated
Treasury bills fell steadily from its recent peak of 17.7 percent at
the July 19 auction to 13.4 percent at the August 17 auction. The
rate rose slightly in the three weeks following the election before
falling back to 13.4 percent on September 21. The Mexico City stock
market, which gained steadily in the month before the election, also
has largely leveled off since then.
In Brazil. inflation has continued to fall under its latest
stabilization program, the Plano Real, implemented July 1. Consumer
prices rose 7.8 percent in July, 5.5 percent in August, and are
projected to rise even less in September. By contrast, prices rose
50 percent in June. Under the plan, the central bank committed to
maintain the value of Brazil's newly introduced currency at no less
than one dollar per real. Although nominal interest rates have
declined since early July, the exchange rate has continued to be
about $1.10 per real. The central bank's international reserves
have remained at about $40 billion since June.

Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero resigned in mid-September
after unintentionally stating during an interview that the aim of
the government's economic plan was to support the presidential
candidacy of former finance minister Henrique Cardoso. Owing to the
popularity of the current program. Cardoso holds a strong lead over
other presidential candidates. If he does not amass a majority in
the October 3 election, however, a runoff between the top two
contenders is scheduled for November 15. Ciro Gomes, the new
finance minister, has pledged to adhere to the current program. To
reduce inflationary pressures, the government recently announced
that it would slash tariffs on over 400 goods. Recent reports that
the central bank has had to provide some assistance to banks facing
liquidity problems have caused some disturbance, albeit minor so
far, in financial markets.
The cumulative trade surplus for the year through July 1994 was
$7.6 billion, roughly equalling the surplus recorded over the same
period last year. Economic activity reportedly slowed in July; but
in August retail sales in Sao Paulo have been robust, up 22 percent
from July and 70 percent from a year ago.
In Venezuela. consumer inflation has been restrained by price
controls imposed on basic goods and services in late June. Monetary
policy remains highly expansionary, however, putting upward pressure
on non-controlled prices. Consumer price inflation was 5.2 percent
in August, down from 9 percent in June and 6.3 percent in July;
nevertheless, inflation remains high compared with monthly rates of
about 3 percent last year. The maximum bank loan rate has fallen to
about 3 percent in recent weeks, substantially below consumer
inflation. The authorities hope that negative real interest rates
will stimulate economic activity and reduce urban unemployment. GDP
contracted 2.8 percent in the first half of 1994 from a year

earlier, while the urban unemployment rate reached 8.9 percent in
June, up from 6.6 percent at the beginning of the year. In early
September, the Caldera administration announced an economic recovery
plan that emphasizes deficit reduction, privatization, and foreign
investment in the petroleum industry.
Imports in July dropped nearly 30 percent from a year earlier,
due to weak aggregate demand as well as the strict foreign exchange
controls imposed the previous month. Non-oil exports in July and
August were unchanged from a year earlier, compared with 21 percent
growth during the first half of 1994. The central bank's official
reserves, excluding gold, reached an estimated $7.1 billion at the
end of August, up from $5.5 billion in late June.
Following previous takeovers this year, the authorities on
September 12 took over Banco Consolidado. which holds an estimated 8
percent of deposits in the banking system. The bank will remain
open during restructuring and is expected to be eventually
reprivatized.
In Argentina. growth appears steady while inflation remains
low. Industrial production during the first half of 1994 was up 6
percent from a year earlier. Consumer prices were 3.8 percent
higher in August than a year earlier. Strong import growth caused
the cumulative trade deficit for the year through June to widen to
$2.1 billion, from $240 million for the year-earlier period.
Exports rose 12 percent from the year-earlier period, while imports
rose 34 percent. Argentina registered a current account deficit of
$3.3 billion in the first quarter of 1994, up from $1.8 billion a
year earlier.
The Treasury initiated auctions of three-month peso and dollar
denominated T-bills on August 22. On September 19, the auction
rates for these two bills were 7.5 percent and 6.2 percent

respectively. The government also announced its intention to
privatize nearly all remaining state enterprises by early 1995.
Growth in China remains strong and inflation, which had shown
signs of moderating, has risen again. Value-added in industry rose
18 percent in August compared with the year-earlier period; for the
year through August, industrial output is up 16 percent. This
strong industrial growth still appears slightly slower than growth
last year. Urban consumer prices were 27 percent higher in August
1994 than a year earlier, after rising 24 percent in July. The
continuing problems with inflation have caused the authorities to
postpone additional price reforms, and have led to plans to outlaw
"unreasonable" profits.
China ran a trade surplus of $170 million in August, its third
straight monthly surplus. The trade surplus for the year through
August is $100 million, compared to a deficit of $5.7 billion in the
same period last year The movement from deficit to surplus
reflects strong exports, which are up 32 percent over the first
eight months of last year; imports are up 18 percent. Imports are
reportedly fueled primarily by equipment imports of foreign-funded
enterprises, which account for 45 percent of imports this year.
Equity markets in China boomed in August. The Shanghai and
Shenzhen A share markets, which are not open to foreigners, roughly
tripled between July 29 and September 21. B shares, which are open
only to foreigners, rose about 20 percent over this period. Despite
the recent surge, share prices remain well below their record levels
of last year.
In Taiwan. GNP rose 5.8 percent in the second quarter from the
same quarter last year. Consumer prices in August were up 2.4
percent from July and 7.1 percent from a year earlier. This spike
in inflation was attributed to typhoons that caused food prices to

rise sharply, and is not expected to persist. Taiwan's current
account surplus in the first half of 1994 was $2.4 billion, down
from $3 billion in the first half of last year. In August Taiwan's
trade surplus was $800 million; exports rose 5 percent from the same
month last year, while imports rose 11 percent.
In Korea. real GNP increased by 8.1 percent in the second
quarter from the same quarter last year, driven especially by strong
growth in investment. Rising inflation has accompanied the economic
recovery. Consumer prices rose 7.4 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with a 4.4 percent rise in August 1993. The
central bank has tightened liquidity in an effort to reduce
inflation, contributing to a marked rise in interest rates during
the past three months. The interest rate on three month CDs was
15.3 percent on September 13, almost three hundred basis points
above the average rate in June.
Merchandise exports increased by 11.9 percent in the first
seven months of 1994. as demand strengthened in industrial countries
and yen appreciation enhanced Korea's competitiveness. Merchandise
imports rose 14.7 percent over the same period, however, as strong
investment demand fueled imports of capital goods. Hence, the
current account deficit for the first seven months of this year
widened to $2.9 billion, from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
In Russia, the ruble-dollar exchange rate depreciated 6.2
percent during August and about 6 percent during the first three
weeks of September, up sharply from the 3.8 percent average monthly
depreciation from May through July. The pressure on the ruble
appears to reflect substantial credits to the agricultural sector,
the industrial sector, and the Northern Territories, which has
increased demand for dollars.

Russian official statistics indicate that during the first
eight months of 1994. real GDP fell 16.5 percent and industrial
production contracted 23.4 percent compared with the same period in
1993. These figures probably overstate the actual decline in
economic activity, however, because they do not adequately cover the
private sector. Monthly consumer price inflation in both July and
August was around 5 percent, well below last year's average monthly
rate of 20 percent. On August 22, the Central Bank of Russia
reduced its three-month refinance rate from 12.5 percent a month to
10.8 percent a month.
Through June, Russia was complying with the major commitments
in its Systemic Tranformation Facility (STF) with the IMF. The
fiscal situation, however, continues to deteriorate. Government
officials indicate that nominal federal tax receipts are now running
at only 50 percent of revenue projections. This partly reflects
lower than anticipated inflation, but also reflects sharper than
expected declines in output, increased tax evasion, and
unrealistically optimistic initial projections In response, the
government has reduced expenditures relative to budget and increased
its use of sequestration, in an effort to satisfy fiscal targets
outlined in the STF.
