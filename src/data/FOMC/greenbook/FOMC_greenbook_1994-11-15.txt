Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFNANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy appears to have entered the current quarter with a
substantial amount of forward momentum. Growth in aggregate hours
of production workers surged in October, and industrial output
likely posted a large increase. Sizable gains in employment and in
income as well as upbeat sentiment bode well for household demand.
Contracts and orders point to hefty growth in business fixed
investment, and there is no evidence that the surge in inventory
investment over the past two quarters left firms feeling
overstocked. While there have been hints of wage acceleration as
labor markets tightened further, growth in labor compensation
through the third quarter was little changed as firms succeeded in
further reining in medical benefit costs. Mounting pressures on
manufacturing capacity have continued to push up prices of goods at
early stages of processing, but these increases, as yet, have not
been reflected in a clear pickup in core consumer price inflation.
Employment and Unemployment
Total nonfarm payroll employment increased 194,000 in
October.1 Private payrolls rose 198,000, a shade below the
third-quarter pace, but still a sizable gain. In addition, the
workweek surged so that aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers rose 1 percent--to a level almost
1-1/2 percent (not annual rate) above the third-quarter average.
The October gains in payroll employment were widespread.
Manufacturing employment rose 40,000, owing partly to continued
growth in automobile-related and construction-related
2industries. But, payrolls also increased in textiles, paper,
1. The level of payroll employment was revised up 53,000 in
September, reflecting higher employment in construction,
manufacturing, trade, and government.
2. Some of the manufacturing industries related to construction
are lumber, furniture, and stone, clay, and glass.

printing, and rubber and plastics. Construction added 5,000 jobs in
October after gaining more than 25,000 in September. Employment
rose in residential construction, and further gains were reported at
special trade contractors (electricians, plumbers, carpenters and
other crafts).
Payrolls in the private service-producing sector rose 157,000
in October. Retail trade was up 51,000, with especially large gains
occurring at automotive dealers and at furniture and home furnishing
stores. Similarly, in wholesale trade, much of the October increase
in employment was in durable goods distribution: motor vehicles,
lumber, and construction. Employment in services was up 96,000.
Moderate gains continued in health and business services. Although
rising 15,000 in October, growth in personnel supply services has
slowed in recent months and has accounted for a smaller share of
overall employment growth than it did a year ago.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently announced that
the level of total nonfarm payroll employment in March 1994 will be
revised up 760,000 or about 0.7 percent.3 This revision would be
the largest since 1978 (in percentage terms) and appears to be
broadly based. Data from state unemployment insurance records
suggest that estimates of payroll employment from the BLS
establishment survey began to substantially underestimate employment
growth in December of 1993. However, following its usual
benchmarking procedure, the BLS plans to wedge the revision in
between April 1993 and March 1994. The BLS has not announced
whether this revision will affect payroll employment growth after
March 1994.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers
jumped 0.3 hour to a cyclical high of 34.9 hours in October,

June 1995.

reflecting increases in almost all major sectors. The average
workweek has changed 0.3 hour (up or down) or more in only one out
of ten months since the series began in 1964. Indeed, the workweek
has been especially volatile this year. Between 1964 and 1993, the
monthly absolute change in the workweek averaged 0.1 hour, but so
far this year, the absolute change has averaged more than
40.2 hour. However, experience has shown that large movements in
the workweek tend to be partly reversed (or partly revised away) in
later months.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance averaged 330,000 in
late October. This is in the middle of the range of 315,000 to
340,000 per week that has prevailed since late July and points to
another substantial payroll increase in the November survey.
Employment, as measured by the household survey, jumped 608,000
in October, and the aggregate unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage
point to 5.8 percent. The decline in unemployment was concentrated
among individuals aged 20 to 54; unemployment rates rose for
teenagers and those aged 54 and over. The labor force increased
493,000 in October, and the labor force participation rate rose to
66.8 percent, the highest rate recorded this year. The increase in
participation last month mostly reflected higher rates for men.
Growth in labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector,
which is highly volatile on a quarterly basis, rebounded in the
third quarter--rising 2.7 percent at an annual rate. The gain
reflected a 3.9 percent increase in output and a 1.2 percent
increase in the hours worked of all persons. Over the year ended in
the third quarter--one of accelerated output growth--labor
productivity rose 2.1 percent, well above the staff's estimated
trend rate of growth of 1.4 percent per annum. In manufacturing,

extensive a revision process as the earlier numbers.

productivity increased 5.3 percent (annual rate) in the third
quarter, and over the past four quarters, it has increased
6.4 percent.
Industrial Production
Available indicators suggest that industrial production posted
a large gain in October following growth at a 6.0 percent annual
rate in the third quarter. Accordingly, capacity utilization in
manufacturing, mining, and utilities probably moved up considerably
above the September rate of 84.6 percent.
Manufacturers assembled motor vehicles at an 11.9 million unit
annual rate in October--little changed from the assembly rate in
September. However, that pace ended up to be about 1/2 million
units short of the rate scheduled at the beginning of the month.
Most of the shortfall reflected a temporary shutdown of lines at
General Motors (GM), Ford, and Chrysler in order to address quality
control problems. Following the shortfall in October,
production schedules for the fourth quarter as a whole were revised
up 100,000 units to an annual rate of 12.5 million units. General
Motors, which continues to be plagued by production problems, has
lowered assembly plans, while other domestic manufacturers (both
U.S. and transplants) have raised their schedules.6

Outside of motor vehicle production, manufacturing activity
rose sharply in October. Production worker hours in manufacturing
surged 1/2 percent last month (FRB seasonal basis), with the
increases widespread among industries. After accounting for typical
gains in productivity, the hours data point to continued strong
growth in output of industrial machinery and some categories of
electrical machinery, and a rebound in production of nondurable
materials such as textiles and chemicals. Physical product data
indicate that production of steel posted a large increase in
October, but that output of household appliances fell for the second
consecutive month following hefty increases earlier in the summer.
Production was little changed, on balance, in the few other
industries in which physical product data are available.
With strong increases in manufacturing activity in the past
year, the factory operating rate in September was 84.2 percent, only
about 1 percentage point below the last cyclical peak, and the rate
evidently increased noticeably further in October. Utilization
rates are high in most industries, and only aluminum producers and
aerospace equipment manufacturers have operating rates that have
moved down significantly in the past year. The former reflects, at
least in part, an international agreement to curb production and
raise prices.
Other indicators also point to tight resources in the
manufacturing sector. As measured by the purchasing managers' index
of vendor performance, deliveries have slowed considerably in recent
months (lower-left panel of chart). And unfilled orders for real
adjusted durable goods have moved up sharply (lower-right
panel).7
7. These orders data equal bookings for durable goods industries
that report unfilled orders excluding orders for defense capital
goods and nondefense aircraft--items with particularly long lead
times--and for motor vehicle parts.

Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles held firm into early autumn. In
October, sales of automobiles and light trucks averaged 15.4 million
units at an annual rate (FRB seasonal basis)--about unchanged from
August and September. Sales of light trucks were quite strong last
month, rising to a 6.3 million unit annual rate. In contrast, car
sales fell 400,000 in October, with most of the decline occurring at
the Big Three. At Ford, the drop in auto sales likely reflected the
expiration of some sales incentives, while supply problems may have
held down sales at GM and Chrysler.
Prices of light vehicles have posted larger increases this year
than last, reflecting both supply factors and demand pressures.
Transaction prices for new motor vehicles--as measured by the
CPI--rose 4.1 percent over the year ended in September, up from the
3 percent increase recorded over the previous twelve-month period.
Not enough detail is available in the CPI to distinguish price
changes at the Big Three auto makers from those at foreign
producers. However, independent industry information on sticker
price changes for comparably equipped vehicles indicates that part
of the price increase in light vehicles since last fall can be
traced to the continued appreciation of the yen, which has boosted
prices of Japanese makes and raised demand for Big Three vehicles.

Personal Income and Consumption
Real consumer spending is estimated to have risen at a
3 percent annual rate in the third quarter. This gain in consumer
spending was supported by the solid trend in personal income growth
and the continued high levels of overall consumer confidence.
Consumer spending on durable goods aside from motor vehicles
grew rapidly in the third quarter, advancing at a double-digit rate
for the fourth time in the past five quarters. Furniture and
household equipment purchases expanded nearly 15 percent at an
annual rate, with particularly large gains in sales of computers and
other home electronic equipment. Spending on other nonauto
durable goods grew at a somewhat slower, though still appreciable,
rate. In contrast, consumer outlays for motor vehicles barely crept
up; as noted in previous Greenbooks, spending on motor vehicles
likely was held down in part this summer by limited supplies.
Growth in real spending on nondurable goods was 2.1 percent at
an annual rate in the third quarter. Most of this growth can be
attributed to a large increase in apparel purchases, in which
sizable gains earlier in the summer more than offset a September
8. When available, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
estimates consumer spending on computers using the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey. However, at this point,
the survey data are available only through 1992. For more recent
periods, BEA estimates nominal growth in computer sales using a
weighted average of growth in retail sales at various types of
stores that sell computers. The weights are based on the proportion
of computers in total sales at these stores in 1987. Because this
fraction likely has grown since 1987, BEA's estimate of nominal
growth in computer sales likely is understated.
The misallocation of nominal computer sales probably also causes
BEA's estimates of total real consumer spending to be understated:
Because computer prices have fallen relative to prices of other
goods, nominal sales of computers that have been incorrectly
classified in other categories of spending are being overdeflated.
However, part of this understatement may be offset by a problem with
the raw retail sales data. Some of the computers sold at retail
stores are bought for use by businesses; these sales should be
counted as investment rather than consumption. Although the Census
Bureau attempts to correct for this phenomenon, they are concerned
that they might not be making a large enough adjustment.

decline. Meanwhile, outlays for other nondurable goods rose just
0.7 percent at an annual rate, held down by a decline in spending on
food for home consumption.
Consumer outlays for services also grew moderately in the third
quarter. Real spending on energy services declined nearly
9 percent, as cooler-than-normal temperatures in August and
September held down the demand for residential electricity.
Consumer spending on non-energy services grew 2.8 percent at an
annual rate last quarter, reflecting growth in medical,
recreational, and net foreign travel services.
The gains in consumer spending have been accompanied by solid
growth in real disposable personal income. In the third quarter,
real disposable personal income grew 2.7 percent at an annual rate,
and the most recent employment data suggest a very large increase in
wage and salary income in October. The personal saving rate has
been essentially flat at 4.0 percent since the fourth quarter of
1993.
Some of the recent strength in disposable personal income can
be attributed to a substantial pickup in growth of personal interest
income. Since interest rates began to rise in the fourth quarter of
1993, real interest income has increased about 9 percent at an
annual rate. In the most recent quarter, growth in interest income
accounted for roughly 30 percent of total growth in disposable
personal income. However, the influence of this pickup in interest
income growth on spending likely has been offset in part by higher
interest payments on consumer and mortgage debt.
9. Between the fourth quarter of 1993 and the third quarter of
1994, nominal personal interest income increased $42.5 billion.
Over the same period, nominal personal interest payments rose $10.6
billion and net mortgage interest payments (which are an unpublished
subtraction in rental income) were up $7 billion.

Both the Michigan and Conference Board consumer confidence
indexes remain at the high end of the range seen in the past four
years. The most recent movements in the series, however, have been
mixed. According to the Michigan survey, consumer confidence
improved slightly between July and October; in the Conference Board
survey, consumer confidence turned down a bit. The different
patterns reflect divergent movements in the expected conditions
components in the two surveys. The Michigan index of expected
conditions has increased, boosted by more optimism about personal
financial situations over the next year and business conditions over
the next year and over the next five years. The Conference Board
index of expected conditions has fallen, with respondents reporting
less optimism about employment, income, and business conditions over
the coming six months. However, to this point, the divergence in
the indexes has been relatively small.
Housing Markets
Housing demand and construction were surprisingly strong in the
third quarter, given the increase in mortgage interest rates over
the past year.10 Total housing starts rose 4.4 percent in
September to their highest level of the year. Both single-family
and multifamily construction contributed to the third-quarter
increase.
The single-family housing market has proven to be considerably
more resilient than anticipated. Single-family starts edged up in
the third quarter, despite this year's hikes of 150 to 200 basis
10. Despite increases in starts in both the second and third
quarters, BEA estimates that residential investment expenditures in
the NIPA declined 7.2 percent in the third quarter. Such a
discrepancy is unusual, because most of this component of GDP is
estimated mechanically from lagged starts and cost per unit started.
Nonetheless, because of incomplete data, BEA must project several
inputs to the total at the time of the advance GDP release. Most of
these projections for the third quarter appear to have been
conservative, and we would not be surprised to see residential
investment revised up as more data are received.

points in rates on both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. In
September alone, single-family starts jumped 6 percent. Permit
issuance suggests that estimates of single-family starts might
overstate the true level of activity during the third quarter to
some extent. But, even allowing for possible mismeasurement, home
construction still has been stronger than expected.
Demand for single-family housing also has held up well. New
home sales increased 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter, rising in
each month. In the market for existing homes, sales declined about
2-3/4 percent last quarter, but were off only 5 percent from the
record high reached in the fourth quarter of last year. House
prices also indicate strong demand. As measured by constant-quality
indexes, year-to-year increases in the prices of new and existing
homes sold in the third quarter were about 4 percent--at the top of
the range of recent readings (chart). Transactions prices, which
partially reflect mix shifts, have risen somewhat less.
A number of factors may be offsetting the effect of higher
mortgage interest rates on housing demand. Home sales likely have
been buoyed by the continued solid pace of job and income growth and
the corresponding elevated level of overall consumer confidence. In
addition, standards for approving home mortgage loans may have
eased. Loan-to-value ratios for home purchase loans have risen to
their highest levels since at least the early 1980s, and senior loan
officers at some commercial banks report making home mortgage credit
more available in recent months.
In contrast to the recent construction and sales data, other
indicators of single-family activity have not been so robust.
Although the overall level of consumer confidence remains high, data
on attitudes towards home buying from the Michigan Survey are
considerably less bullish than they were late last year, despite a

recent uptick. In addition, homeowners' assessments of market
conditions in the Michigan Survey for selling a home--an indicator
of potential demand in the trade-up market--were off a bit in the
third quarter. Home builders' evaluations of their current sales
have trended down throughout the year, and applications for home
purchase loans received by mortgage bankers have fallen roughly
1225 percent this year.2 Part of this latter decline may reflect
mortgage bankers' specialization in fixed-rate mortgages, which have
been losing market share to adjustable-rate loans.
Multifamily construction also strengthened in the third
quarter, and this sector remains on the gradual recovery path that
began early last year. Permit issuance has been strong relative to
starts, providing further evidence of firming in this market. Gains
in multifamily construction since the trough in early 1993 have been
concentrated in the South, where starts have doubled. In the third
quarter, the South accounted for nearly half of the national total
(chart, top panel). By contrast, the increase in single-family
construction during that period has been more proportionally
distributed across the four regions (bottom panel).
BusinessFixed Investment
According to BEA's advance estimate, real business fixed
investment advanced at an annual rate of 7 percent in the third
quarter. Spending for producers' durable equipment (PDE) was up
11 percent at an annual rate while outlays for nonresidential
structures (NRS) fell at a 5.4 percent annual rate. However, the
September construction put-in-place data were significantly stronger
than BEA's assumption in the advance GDP release, and imply that

composite index.

the strength of sales this year. Analysts at the National
Association of Home Builders, the sponsor of the survey, have no
explanation for the discrepancy.

third-quarter NRS will be revised up to roughly a 5 percent (annual
rate) increase. In addition, revisions to September shipments of
nondefense capital goods imply a modest upward revision to third-
quarter PDE. Taking these data into account, the staff estimates
that growth in business fixed investment last quarter will be
revised up to a 10 percent annual rate.
Taking a somewhat longer perspective, growth in business
capital spending, while still brisk, has slowed somewhat from the
extremely rapid rate witnessed last year. The slower growth of
capital spending in 1994 is explained by a sharp decline in the
growth rate of office and computing equipment purchases. In 1993,
real office and computing outlays grew almost 60 percent, adding
roughly $48 billion--or 1 percentage point--to real GDP growth. So
far this year, real outlays for office and computing equipment have
grown at an annual rate of about 10 percent, adding only $12 billion
to growth over the first three quarters of the year.
Most of the deceleration in real outlays for office and
computing equipment reflects smaller gains in nominal spending;
after advancing 35 percent in 1993, nominal computer outlays have
risen only 6 percent (annual rate) so far this year. Most analysts
attribute the slower growth to two main factors. First, computer
shipments appear to have been limited by scattered capacity
constraints. Second, upgrading activity for personal computers
appears to have slowed considerably. In 1993, many firms switched
to machines based on the 486 microprocessor in order to effectively
run Windows software. While the current cutting-edge processors are
significantly faster than the 486, many firms believe that 486
processors are fast enough for their applications and have deferred
upgrades. The deceleration in real computer expenditures also, in
part, reflects a slowing in the rate of decline in BEA's computer

deflator, which has fallen 5-1/4 percent at an annual rate so far
this year, compared with the decline of roughly 15 percent recorded
in the previous two years. As mentioned in previous Greenbooks, we
believe that the slowdown in the decline in the deflator has been
exaggerated by price mismeasurement.13
The demand for other nondefense capital goods has continued to
be quite strong. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft and computers increased 1.4 percent in September, while
shipments were flat. With orders remaining well above shipments,
backlogs are large and growing for most types of equipment. The
recent growth in orders has been especially strong for communication
equipment, where among other things, the demand for digital
equipment from telephone companies has surged.
Business purchases of transportation equipment grew at a
healthy pace in the third quarter. Purchases of motor vehicles,
which dropped off in the second quarter, headed back up in the
third. Sales to daily rental fleets generally have been solid.
Also, heavy truck sales have continued at a very high level, and
manufacturers are increasing capacity in order to meet demand.
Shipments of complete aircraft, however, fell a bit further in the
third quarter.
Given the expected upward revision to investment in
nonresidential structures in the third quarter--and smoothing
through the volatility so far this year--nonresidential construction
looks to be increasing a little faster than last year. Construction
of industrial and commercial buildings has been fairly strong, while
outlays for hotels have dropped back a great deal since the
13. The deflator is based upon the PPI for office and computing
equipment. The BLS only changes the basket of computers used to
construct the index every two years, with the next change scheduled
for January 1995. As a result, the basket used to gauge computer
price movements currently contains relatively outmoded computers,
whose prices were already low at the start of this year.

beginning of the year. Looking ahead, permits for new
nonresidential construction were strong in the third quarter, which
bodes well for fourth-quarter construction. Elsewhere, oil and gas
exploration has been down slightly so far this year. Natural gas
producers are optimistic about the demand for gas over the next
decade, but the large drop in gas prices last summer has delayed
some drilling plans.14
Manufacturing and Trade Inventories
According to BEA's advance estimate, real nonfarm inventory
investment was $56 billion in the third quarter, up from an already
robust $52 billion pace in the second quarter. However, Census data
for September--which were not available at the time of the advance
GDP estimate--and revisions to data for August point to a
$12 billion downward revision to BEA's estimate of real inventory
investment in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors last
quarter.15
By sector, manufacturing inventories rose only $4 billion at an
annual rate in current-cost terms in August and then declined at an
$8 billion annual rate in September. Over the two months, stocks in
the aircraft and parts category ran off further, while inventories
of computers and office equipment were down sharply in
September.16 (This drop was accompanied by a 2.5 percent jump in
computer shipments in September.) Aside from these factors,
14. The recent flooding in eastern Texas damaged two pipelines
that transport gasoline and heating oil from Houston to the
Northeast. Although the disruption of supplies may have had a
significant impact on energy prices, the necessary repairs to the
pipelines--which will show up in NRS--are reported to have been
relatively minor.
15. Census current-cost retail inventory data for September will
become available November 16. In the advance GDP estimate, BEA
assumed a $15-1/2 billion accumulation in retail inventories
(excluding automotive dealers).
16. Inventories held by producers of aircraft and parts have been
trending down since early 1991, reflecting ongoing sluggishness in
the commercial aviation market and retrenchment in defense spending.

manufacturing inventories increased moderately in August and
September, led by increases in stocks of telecommunication
equipment, electronic components, and service industry machinery.
For most industries, inventory-shipments ratios in September were
still at or near their historical lows.
In the trade sector, merchant wholesalers continued to build
their stocks in August and September, but at $10-1/2 billion
(current-cost terms), the pace of accumulation has slowed from early
summer. Recent increases in wholesale stocks generally have
occurred in types of goods for which orders have been strong
upstream in manufacturing--for example, in selected machinery and
capital equipment, motor vehicles and accessories, and electrical
goods. Data on retail inventories are available only through
August. In August, retail stocks surged, following a small decline
in July. Outside of auto dealers, a sizable portion of retailers'
August inventory buildup was in stocks held by furniture and
appliance dealers, where sales have been brisk in recent months. In
general, retailers' inventories appear to be in satisfactory
condition at present. Inventory-sales ratios for many types of
retail establishments in August were below the recent highs observed
around the turn of the year, and the inventory-sales ratio at G.A.F.
(general merchandise, apparel, and furniture) stores in August
remained in line with recent norms.
Federal Sector
Real federal purchases increased 9.8 percent at an annual rate
in the third quarter. Real defense purchases rose at an 8.6 percent
rate after sharp declines earlier in the fiscal year had left
spending below levels consistent with legislated appropriations.
Part of the increase in defense purchases last quarter also
reflected increased purchases of ammunition, food, and clothing,

which may have been due to the military operation in Haiti. In
fiscal year 1994, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
estimates that the costs of the Haiti operation and taking care of
the detainees was $483.5 million, with roughly three-quarters of
this sum being spent in September. To date, OMB has not provided
estimates for FY1995. Nondefense purchases in the third quarter
also rebounded strongly from an unusually low second-quarter
level.17
The deficit for FY1994 was $203 billion, compared with
$255 billion in FY1993. Excluding deposit insurance outlays, the
deficit fell $72 billion this past fiscal year. Receipts rose
9 percent in FY1994, and outlays excluding deposit insurance
increased 2 percent; deposit insurance outlays were about
$20 billion less negative, on net, than in the previous fiscal year.
In FY1994, all receipt categories registered strong growth.
Personal income taxes and social insurance taxes grew 6.5 percent
and 7.7 percent, respectively. Corporate tax receipts grew an
especially robust 19.5 percent, reflecting both strong income growth
and a probable increase in the effective corporate tax rate.
On the outlay side, all major spending categories except net
interest showed less growth in FY1994 than in FY1993. Defense
spending fell 3-1/2 percent and other spending (excluding deposit
insurance) rose 3-1/2 percent. At 9.4 percent, growth in health-
related spending was still high in FY1994; nevertheless, it was
2 percentage points lower than in FY1993.
17. Two special factors depressed nondefense compensation in the
second quarter. First, the day off given federal workers for the
funeral of former President Nixon reduced hours worked of government
workers, thereby reducing real federal compensation. Second,
nondefense civilian buyouts were first authorized in the second
quarter, and agencies concentrated all of their FY1994 buyouts in
that quarter so as to maximize fiscal year savings on compensation.

In September, individual nonwithheld tax payments were about
unchanged from a year earlier. September contains one of the four
"due dates" for estimated tax payments, and these payments normally
are a useful indicator of total individual income tax liabilities
for the year. This year, however, changes in estimated payments
rules have altered the timing of receipts, making these data
difficult to interpret.18
On the legislative front, all thirteen regular appropriations
bills for FY1995 have been signed by the President. Each bill is in
close accord with the President's total spending request and
complies with the spending limits set in OBRA-93.
State and Local Governments
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments increased at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the third
quarter, the largest quarterly gain in a year. Purchases of goods
and services were up at a 2-1/2 percent annual rate. Construction
spending rose at a 10.4 percent clip: Growth has been robust for
water and sewer systems and other buildings (a category that
includes prisons, offices, courtrooms, and the like), while
construction of highways has remained flat all year.
State government employment fell 4,000 in October. Employment
in education dropped back 9,000--possibly because the late survey
week in September picked up some gains that normally would not have
appeared until October. At the local government level, employment
was unchanged. Employment in local education also fell in October,
18. Under current safe-harbor provisions, taxpayers with adjusted
gross income in 1993 of less than $150,000 can avoid IRS penalties
for late payment if payments in 1994 are at least as great as the
lesser of 90 percent of this years' tax liability or 100 percent of
last year's tax liability. For other taxpayers, the previous year's
safe harbor is 110 percent of last year's tax liability. Under last
year's law, some taxpayers were denied the option of the previous
year's liability safe harbor entirely.

but local government employment outside of education rose 5,000,
after a gain of more than 40,000 in September.
In the third quarter, the NIPA estimate of the deficit of
operating and capital accounts remained at around $40 billion, a
level that has prevailed for about a year. This aggregate deficit
has gradually trended down as a share of GDP in recent years,
indicating some improvement in the fiscal position of state and
local governments taken as a group. This year, the greatest deficit
reductions appear to have been in states' general fund accounts
(largely operating accounts) mainly because revenues were stronger
than expected.
States' end-of-year "balances" often are the focus of fiscal
analysis. These balances include funds carried over from the
preceding years' balances as well as the excess of current-period
revenues over expenditures. According to a recent survey by the
National Conference of State Legislatures, general funds balances
for the states taken together increased in FY1993 and in FY1994
after dipping in the previous two fiscal years. For FY1994, which
ended in June, the end-of-year general fund balance was
3-1/2 percent of expenditures--still below the 5 percent level
considered prudent by market analysts, but more than double the
share expected when FY1994 budgets were in the planning stage. As
seen in the chart, positive balances were reported by most states;
furthermore, there was less variation across states in fiscal
balances relative to recent years. However, California continued to
record a negative balance, and three other states showed a zero
balance.
Labor Costs
Growth in overall hourly compensation was still moderate as of
the third quarter. Over the twelve months ended in September 1994,

ECI hourly compensation rose 3.3 percent--down from 3.7 percent over
the same period a year ago. However, in October, average hourly
earnings (AHE) of production or nonsupervisory workers jumped
0.7 percent, and the twelve-month percent change in AHE moved up to
2.9 percent--the highest reading since February 1992.
The slowing in overall ECI compensation over the past year
occurred despite the rapid decline in the unemployment rate from
6.7 percent in October 1993 to 5.8 percent in October 1994.19 As
seen by the solid line in the middle panel of the chart, the
aggregate unemployment rate was above the staff's estimate of the
NAIRU throughout most of this period. Historically, given inflation
expectations, hourly compensation growth begins to accelerate--and
then rather gradually--only after the unemployment rate drops below
the NAIRU. And, even though econometric models generally do
indicate that the change in the unemployment rate has some effect on
growth in hourly compensation, the effect is minor compared with
that attributable to the gap between the level of the unemployment
rate and the NAIRU.
Compensation growth over the past year slowed or was little
changed in almost all major occupations and in a number of
industries. Among industries, hourly compensation in manufacturing
slowed more than 1 percentage point over the past year to
3.2 percent. Compensation also slowed in utilities, services, and
finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE). However, hourly
compensation in transportation accelerated 1-1/2 percentage points
to 4-1/4 percent. In addition, there are signs that the strength in
residential construction over the past year is boosting
19. Unemployment rates in 1994 are not directly comparable with
earlier values because of the redesign of the Current Population
Survey (CPS). Our working assumption is that the redesign of the
CPS and new population controls added 0.15 percentage point to the
level of the unemployment rate on the old basis.

compensation. Hourly compensation in construction rose 3.9 percent
over the twelve months ended in September--up 3/4 percentage point
over the same period of a year ago. Earlier this year, the pickup
in compensation growth in construction appeared to be concentrated
among white-collar occupations: Despite strong growth in trades
employment, compensation growth of blue-collar workers in
construction remained moderate. However; the third-quarter ECI data
suggest that compensation growth has begun to pick up in many blue-
collar occupations. Indeed, over the twelve months ended in
October, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers in construction rose 3.1 percent--up almost 1-1/2 percentage
points relative to the pace over the same period a year ago.
Growth in ECI wages and salaries slowed 0.2 percentage point
over the past twelve months to 2.9 percent. Growth in benefit costs
slowed considerably more than wages did: Over the twelve months
ended in September, ECI hourly benefit costs rose 4 percent, down
nearly 1-1/2 percentage points from the same period of a year ago.
Growth in employers' hourly costs for health insurance slowed nearly
3 percentage points to 4.3 percent. Also, increases in legally
required benefits were down considerably, reflecting smaller
increases for unemployment insurance and workers' compensation. In
contrast, over the twelve months ended in September, pension
benefits increased 11-1/2 percent compared to a gain of about
4 percent over the same period a year ago.20 Employers' increased
demand for overtime was reflected in a pickup in growth of premium
pay rates from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the twelve months ended
20. We had expected a $2.5 billion contribution from GM to its
pension fund to boost ECI benefit costs in the third quarter.
However, GM did not report this contribution in the ECI because it
fell outside of the definition of labor costs established by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board.

in September.21 Nonproduction bonuses also accelerated over the
year to a rate of 8-1/2 percent.
ECI hourly compensation growth slowed in all four major regions
over the past year, and the dispersion in growth rates narrowed.
Over the twelve months ended in September 1993, hourly compensation
growth ranged from 3.2 percent in the West to 4.2 percent in the
Midwest; over the twelve months ended in September 1994, hourly
compensation growth ranged from 3 percent in the West to 3.7 percent
in the Midwest.

The fixed-weighted ECI hourly compensation index is designed to
measure labor cost inflation. In contrast, hourly compensation of
all workers in the nonfarm business sector is an average of all
workers' compensation, and thus is affected by employment shifts
among industries and occupations as well as changes in overtime
hours. In the third quarter, nonfarm hourly compensation rose
2.9 percent in the third quarter, and over the four quarters ended
in 1994:Q3, nonfarm hourly compensation was up 3 percent. Given
growth in labor productivity of 2.1 percent over the past year, unit
labor costs rose only 0.9 percent.
21. Premium pay rates are the product of hourly pay rates and the
overtime premium: The pickup in growth in premium pay reflected
increases in the overtime premium. Fluctuations in the number of
overtime hours are not reflected in the ECI. However, total
overtime earnings are reflected in income measures like nonfarm
hourly compensation.

II-46
In the third quarter, real product hourly compensation rose
221.1 percent. Over the past year, real product compensation
increased about 1 percent, lagging productivity growth of 2 percent
over the same period. As seen in the chart, although real product
compensation and labor productivity share longer-run trends, they
can diverge for considerable periods of time. For example, during
both the 1960s and 1980s, the level of real compensation remained
below the level of labor productivity over much of each expansion.
In our first reading of wages in the fourth quarter, average
hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.7 percent in October. The large increase in AHE did not appear to
reflect shifts in the industrial mix of employment. Earnings rose
in all major sectors, and the BLS's chain-weighted hourly earnings
measure also rose 0.7 percent.23

0.2 percent. At the finished level, producer prices also were
restrained in September, as the overall PPI fell 0.5 percent and the
index excluding food and energy edged up just 0.1 percent. But
prices of intermediate materials other than food and energy rose
0.6 percent in September--their fourth consecutive increase of
around 1/2 percent--as high capacity utilization rates in
manufacturing continue to generate pressures on prices.
Retail energy prices fell 0.7 percent in September, following
large increases in the previous two months. Gasoline prices fell
0.6 percent, in part reflecting the decline in crude oil prices
between July and September. Lower crude costs helped push down
heating oil prices as well. Fees for natural gas and electricity,
which make up half of the CPI energy index, also fell in September,
by 1.0 and 0.5 percent respectively. Mild summer weather, which
held down the usual seasonal spike in electricity demand, likely
24contributed to the moderation in both prices. So far this year,
lower prices of natural gas and electricity have helped hold down
increases in overall energy prices to a 3-1/2 percent pace, despite
crude oil price increases of about $3 per barrel, on net, between
December 1993 and September 1994.
As mentioned earlier, the flood in eastern Texas caused some
damage to the pipeline system in the Houston area on October 20th,
disrupting transportation lines from the Gulf Coast to the
Northeast. These lines supply nearly half of the motor and heating
fuels used in the Northeast region of the country. Coming on the
eve of the reformulated gasoline program, the pipeline ruptures have
added to supply uncertainties and contributed to price increases.
Since the flood, wholesale gasoline prices on spot and futures

production because many utilities bring relatively higher cost
natural-gas-fired generators on line to meet peaks in electricity
demand.

than accounted for the moderation in food price increases.
Prices of consumer commodities other than food and energy were
about unchanged in September, their third consecutive small monthly
change. After posting large declines in July and August, apparel
prices were about unchanged in September. So far this year, apparel
prices have fallen, on balance, at the retail level. Producer
prices of apparel manufactured in the United States have been
unchanged over this period, while prices of imported apparel have
increased only modestly--at a 1 percent annual rate--despite the
decline in the dollar. As mentioned earlier, prices of new motor
vehicles have accelerated in 1994--rising at a 4-3/4 percent annual
pace so far this year.
Prices of services other than energy rose 0.2 percent in
September, down from a 0.4 percent increase in August, but the same
as the increase in the preceding four months. Over the past twelve
months, non-energy service prices have increased 3.5 percent,
compared with 4.0 percent over the preceding twelve-month period.
The moderate September increase for non-energy services came despite
a 0.5 percent increase in owners' equivalent rent, the largest
service component. In part, the increase in owners' equivalent rent
was offset by a 1-1/2 percent decline in hotel fees. A large
decline in tuition and other school fees also helped hold down

service-price increases in September. Tuition and fees have
decelerated 1-1/2 percentage points over the past year. Data from
the College Board indicate that the deceleration has been
concentrated in tuition of public colleges and universities--likely
reflecting the improved fiscal situation of many state governments.
Among other services, cable television fees fell 1.0 percent in
September and are down 3-1/2 percent over the past twelve months.
Medical services prices rose 0.4 percent for the fifth consecutive
month in September; nonetheless, on a twelve-month-change basis,
medical fees continued to decelerate.
The 0.5 percent drop in the PPI for finished goods in September
was the largest monthly decline since August 1993. As with the CPI,
the PPI was pulled down by energy prices, which fell 2.9 percent.
Also, finished food prices edged down 0.2 percent, pushed down by a
10 percent decline in coffee prices. Among categories excluding
food and energy, prices increased just 0.1 percent in September;
passenger car prices fell 1.1 percent in September, partially
offsetting the 1-1/2 percent increase over the preceding two months,
while tobacco prices rose 2 percent, following a 1-1/2 percent
increase in August.
The moderate increases in finished goods prices have continued
despite the pickup in price increases at intermediate stages of
processing. Intermediate materials make up about half of variable
costs of finished goods manufactures in the nonfood, non-energy
sector. With demand high, manufacturers of finished goods will be
unlikely to continue to allow their profit margins to erode.
Accordingly, finished goods price increases may pick up in coming
months.
Since the last Greenbook, prices of many industrial materials
have increased sharply. Among metals, the most notable price

increases were for zinc, tin, and aluminum.25 On balance, the
price of rubber has moved up even further in recent weeks, and is
now nearly 60 percent higher than its level at the end of last year.
The price of steel scrap, however, has edged down since the last
Greenbook. Precious metals prices also are down, on net. Prices of
domestically produced agricultural products have been mixed since
the last Greenbook. Coffee prices remain volatile, but have moved
down, on net, since the last Greenbook; nonetheless, their level is
about three times higher than at the beginning of the year.
25. Spot prices for aluminum have risen dramatically over the past
year. This may reflect, in part, the impact of voluntary supply
limitations by world producers rather than domestic capacity
constraints. Russia, along with producers in several other
countries, agreed to limit supply earlier this year after plants in
the former Soviet Union flooded world markets with aluminum in 1993
and drove prices sharply lower.

The Journal of Commerce index is based almost entirely on industrial commodities, with a small weight given to energy commodities, and the
CRB spot price index consists entirely of industrial commodities, excluding energy. The CRB futures index gives about a 60 percent weight
to food commodities and splits the remaining weight roughly equally among energy commodities, industrial commodities and precious metals.

APPENDIX
REVISIONS TO THE CPI
Starting with the January 1995 CPI, to be released in February,
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will make several changes to
the consumer price index. The most important changes will occur in
the rent-of-shelter and food-at-home components. Taken together,
the BLS estimates that these changes will reduce measured consumer
price inflation about 0.1 percentage point per year.
The BLS is making two changes in the indexes for the rent of
shelter. First, in both renters' rent and owners' equivalent rent,
the BLS will switch from using a weighted average of reported one-
month and six-month rental changes (with the bulk of the weight on
the one-month change) in calculating the monthly rental index, to
using only the six-month change. Currently, the sum of the one-
month changes has generally been less than the six-month change.
The BLS believes that this difference reflects downward bias in the
one-month changes, since the one-month changes are based on tenants'
recall, whereas the six-month change is based on a comparison of
actual rents. The BLS estimates that this revision will boost
reported annual changes in renters' rent 0.2 percentage point and
reported annual changes in owners' equivalent rent 0.1 percentage
point.
More than offsetting this upward revision is a change in the
formula used to aggregate the individual rents used to construct
owners' equivalent rent. The current formula takes a simple average
of the price changes from the various rental units in a sampling
area (usually about the size of a county). The new formula first
calculates an average rent level across all the units in the area
and then calculates the six-month percentage change in the average
rental rate. The old formula had severe deficiencies that led to an
upward bias. The BLS estimates that this revision will lower
increases in owners' equivalent rent index 0.5 percentage point per
year.
To keep the outlets in the CPI sample up to date with current
shopping patterns, on a rotating basis, the BLS surveys consumers in
the various metropolitan areas on where they shop. From this
survey, the BLS draws a new sample of stores every five years for
each metropolitan area. Unfortunately, under the BLS's current
procedures, the cutover to the new survey causes price changes to be
biased upward in the first few months after sample rotation. This
bias is particularly acute in the food-at-home category.
To address this problem, the BLS will begin collecting two
parallel samples for the first three months after sample rotation.
During this transition period, the old sample will be used in the
official index. The BLS estimates that by avoiding the use of the
1. The BLS will also begin introducing generic prescription drugs
more rapidly into the CPI sample, but this is not expected to have a
noticeable effect on the overall index.
2. The BLS surveys rental units every six months and asks for
both the current rent and the tenants' recollections of rent the
month before. The BLS believes that too many people assume that the
rent the month before was the same as the current month's rent.
II-A-1

II-A-2
price change from the new sample during the first three months after
sample rotation, most of the bias will be eliminated.
The net effect of the two rent-of-shelter changes will be to
reduce the measured increase in the CPI excluding food and energy by
about 0.08 percentage point per year, and the overall CPI by about
0.06 percentage point per year. The BLS estimates that sample
rotation bias in the food-at-home category boosts overall inflation
by about 0.04 percentage point per year. So, the overall effect of
these changes will be to reduce measured CPI inflation by
0.10 percentage point per year beginning in January 1995.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Although the federal funds rate has remained unchanged over the
intermeeting period, other market interest rates have risen
appreciably. Strong economic data and the slumping dollar have
heightened concerns about inflationary pressures; market
participants generally have raised their sights for prospective Fed
tightening actions, some expressing the view that the System had
fallen "behind the curve." Three-month market rates have risen more
than 50 basis points, while the thirty-year Treasury yield is up
more than 25 points to 8 12 percent. Meanwhile, stock price indexes
have changed little, on net, over the intermeeting period, as the
effect of the rise in interest rates has been offset by news of
surprisingly robust corporate earnings.
M2 shrank further in October as rates on liquid deposits
continued to lag the rise in market yields. Bond mutual funds
continued to experience heavy redemptions, and the rise in stock
mutual funds slowed; however, noncompetitive tenders for Treasury
securities attracted a large volume of funds. Despite the weakness
in M2, M3 expanded at a moderate pace, boosted by strength in large
time deposits and institution-only money market mutual funds.
Growth of debt of the domestic nonfederal sectors appears to
have remained moderate in recent months. Businesses have continued
to shun the bond markets, turning to bank loans and commercial paper
issues. Corporate cash flow evidently has remained fairly ample,
and much of business borrowing has been related to mergers and
acquisitions. While there is little information available on recent
household sector debt growth, at commercial banks mortgage lending
slowed in October and consumer loans remained robust. State and
local government debt is estimated to be falling, as gross issuance
of bonds remains subdued and retirements apparently continue to be

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 edged down 1 percent at an annual rate in October, after
declining a bit in both August and September. This contraction
dropped the aggregate to the 1 percent lower bound of its annual
range as of last month.
The weakness in M2 last month reflected primarily outflows of
liquid deposits. Rates offered on these instruments have moved up
little this year and have been virtually unchanged since the policy
tightening in August. For example, rates on savings deposits and
MMDAs, the largest component of M2, rose only about 1/4 percentage
point between February and October, a period over which money market
rates increased about 1-3/4 percentage points. Not surprisingly,
these deposits continued to run off last month.
Among the other components of M2, M1 deposits were especially
weak, depressed not only by rising opportunity costs but by several
special factors as well. For example, reductions in mortgage
refinancings have had a negative effect on the growth of demand
deposits; in October this component declined at a 6-1/2 percent
annual rate. In addition, the contraction of OCDs in part reflected
the sweep of investors' NOW account balances into MMDAs at
; the spread of sweep accounts is
estimated to have lowered the annualized growth of OCDs 4-1/2
percentage points in September and 2 percentage points in October.
Retail money market mutual funds (MMMFs), which declined in
August and September, rebounded in October at a 9 percent growth
rate. In contrast to the returns on liquid deposits, rates on such
funds and on retail CDs have risen more in line with market interest

rates of late (chart), leading to some substitution between these
components and liquid deposits. The effective annual yield on some
money funds is now above 5 percent for the first time since February
1992. Growth of overnight RPs and Eurodollar deposits also helped
boost M2 in October.
It seems unlikely that M2 growth is being held down by shifts
to longer-term mutual funds. Net inflows into stock funds moderated
in September and October, with the slowing distributed across
domestic and international funds. Bond funds registered sizable net
redemptions in September and apparently even more rapid runoffs in
October. Although the reductions continued to be particularly large
in GNMA and government bond funds, other types of bond funds also
posted outflows in October; in the case of "income" funds--which
invest primarily in corporate and agency bonds--the outflow in
October was the first this year. While bond mutual funds
contracted, direct purchases of government securities through
noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions were robust, at $2.7
billion in October; this continued a trend begun in May.
M3 grew at a 3-1/2 percent pace last month, with the strength
of the non-M2 components placing it in the lower portion of its
annual range. Institution-only money market mutual funds spurted
upward, as their returns have about closed the gap with market
interest rates. M3 also was buoyed by strong issuance of large time
deposits. To some extent, these deposits may have replaced
nondeposit funds, which are estimated to have declined in October.
Bank credit rose at a 3 percent annual rate in October, as
banks continued to draw down their holdings of government
securities, while loan expansion remained brisk. Consumer loans
expanded at a rapid 18 percent rate in October, sustaining the pace
of the third quarter. The rise in real estate loans in October was

at a 5 percent annual rate--about half that of the third quarter.
The slowing reflected in part an acceleration in the runoff of
commercial loans at branches and agencies of foreign banks
Business loans expanded at almost a 12 percent annual rate in
October. According to market reports, banks have continued to ease
their terms on C&I loans, including extending loan maturities to
accommodate borrowers who may be deterred from entering the capital
markets because of the rise in bond rates. Aggressive loan pricing
may be on the wane, however. Market reports indicated that some
syndicated loan deals had to be repriced to find sufficient buyers
and that a major money center bank which is a leading loan
syndicator indicated it would pass up deals rather than reduce its
yields.
The November senior loan officer opinion survey showed a
continuation of trends apparent in recent surveys. A significant
fraction of the respondents reported a further easing in terms and
standards for business firms of all sizes, owing to increased
competition for loans and to an improved economic outlook. In
addition, a substantial number of respondents reported a further
pickup in the demand for business loans. Some banks also reported
increased willingness to lend to consumers. By contrast, most
respondents continued to report little change in commercial real
estate lending standards.
The rise in loans has been funded in part by a decline in
security holdings at banks. Government securities ran off at nearly
an 18 percent pace in October, the fourth consecutive month of
decline. Marking to market likely accounted for a significant part
of this decline. Purchases of municipal and other securities, as
well as an upward revaluation of off-balance-sheet positions, more

Business Finance
The rise in bond yields, substantial internal funds, and
relatively attractive terms on short-term financing continued to
damp public bond issuance by nonfinancial firms through early
November. Junk bond issuance has been especially weak, declining in
October from the already low third-quarter level.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was
up only slightly in September and October from the depressed levels
of late summer. IPO issuance is expected to be heavier in November
as potential issuers sense an improved tone of the market. In
contrast to the situation during the summer, recent issues have been
priced within or above filing ranges (the expected range for the
price of the issue before it is marketed), and some issues have
recorded large returns on the initial trading day.
For financial firms, bond issuance has been better maintained:
gross issuance of asset-backed securities so far in 1994 already
exceeds last year's total. These securities are attractive to
investors when interest rates are rising because they have
relatively short maturities and often offer floating interest rates.
Equity issuance by financial corporations declined in October, as
many proposed REIT offerings were cancelled or postponed.
Corporate earnings statements for the third quarter have been
strong, with a majority of reports exceeding analysts' expectations.
Earnings per share for the nonfinancial sector increased more than
20 percent for the year ended in the third quarter. The financial
sector has registered less improvement. Data from the third-quarter

Call Report are not yet available, but press reports on earnings at
major bank holding companies are mixed Despite slightly narrower
net interest margins, many banks managed to increase profits by
expanding their lending. However, banks with large trading
operations saw related revenues dwindle in the last quarter.
Altogether, earnings for bank holding companies appear to have grown
12 percent over the year ended in the third quarter.
The S&P 500 price index has changed little on net over the past
year. As a result, the ratio of the S&P 500 price index to the
twelve-month trailing earnings of companies in that index fell from
about 24 in October of 1993 to about 18 this October (chart). The
price-earnings ratio adjusted for non-recurring restructuring
charges exhibits a similar, though less steep, decline.2
The credit quality of financial corporations rose slightly on
balance in the third quarter. According to ratings changes by
Moody's. financial companies experienced nineteen upgrades and seven
downgrades, providing the seventh consecutive quarter of improvement
in this sector. When measured by the value of rated debt, the
improvement for the financial sector was even more striking:
upgrades exceeded downgrades by a margin of ten to one. In the
nonfinancial sector, downgrades continued to exceed upgrades, but by
a smaller margin than in the first half of the year. The modest
slippage in the third quarter reflected further downgrades of
electric utilities as well as some net deterioration of ratings for
industrial companies. Among investment-grade companies, rating
changes were about offsetting. However, for speculative-grade
companies, downgrades outnumbered upgrades, continuing the pattern

set in the second quarter. Most notably, USAir--with more than
$3-1/2 billion of rated debt outstanding--was downgraded from B1 to
B2.
Merger activity has remained brisk since the previous FOMC
meeting, with the announcements of five deals, each valued at more
than $1 billion, that are expected to close in 1995. The two
largest of these involve hospital chains, extending the trend toward
consolidation among health-care providers. As has been the case
throughout the year, the recently announced mergers will be financed
largely by stock swaps; nonetheless, cash-financed transactions have
been occurring with some frequency, which has boosted the amount of
merger-related share retirements.
To finance a few of the recent large mergers, acquirers have
accessed the commercial paper market for interim funds. Over the
six weeks ended October 26, total nonfinancial commercial paper
outstanding increased about $12 billion, of which approximately
four-fifths was merger related. Dealers expect that an additional
$10 to $15 billion of merger-related commercial paper will be issued
before the end of the year.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt has remained
sluggish, averaging about $9 billion in September and October, less
than half the rate during 1993. A lack of refunding activity
largely accounted for this sluggishness. With retirements estimated
to have exceeded gross issuance in September and October, the
outstanding stock of long-term tax-exempt debt likely continued to
decline.
Meanwhile, Los Angeles County sold $2 billion of taxable bonds
in October, a record amount. The bonds allowed the county to reduce
the expected costs of funding its pension plan. At least one more

California county plans to issue a taxable pension bond before year-
end.
Gross issuance of short-term tax-exempt debt fell in September
and October from the brisk pace in the summer, when a number of
states and municipalities had been in the market to replace maturing
debt. On balance, retirements of short-term debt have continued to
exceed gross issuance, and the amount outstanding fell to about $32
billion at the end of October from a record $43 billion at the end
of June.
The ratio of long-term tax-exempt yields to Treasuries remained
low through mid-October, held down by the limited supply of debt.
However, in November, the yield ratio has risen sharply, boosted by
heavy net sales of municipal bonds by mutual funds (chart).
Downgrades of municipal debt exceeded upgrades during the third
quarter, but this deterioration mainly reflected finances in
California. The three major credit agencies downgraded almost $20
billion in California debt during July; this accounted for about 90
percent of the municipal debt downgraded last quarter. Outside of
California, upgrades exceeded downgrades, as financial conditions of
most other state and local governments were buoyed by the strength
in the economy.

The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance most of

billion.

rely on bills for more than half the funds raised this quarter.
Since the end of September, the Treasury has increased the weekly
bill auctions from $23.2 billion to $27.2 billion.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to finance a sizable
expansion of their mortgage portfolios with debt issuance. Fannie
Mae's outstanding debt grew 20 percent from September 1993 to
September 1994; Freddie Mac's debt, currently one-third the size of
Fannie Mae's, increased 60 percent in the same period. Most newly
issued debt has been conventional debentures with call options.
Meanwhile, yield spreads of agencies over Treasuries, in the two-to-
three-year sector of the maturity spectrum, have widened
considerably, from less than 3 basis points a year ago to around 15
basis points now. Spreads in the seven-year sector have remained at
25 to 30 basis points. Agencies have not issued much debt with
longer maturities.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on home mortgages have increased considerably
over the intermeeting period. The average contract rate on
conventional fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) rose to 9.05 percent in the
first week of November, the highest level in more than three years,
and 32 basis points higher than at the time of the September FOMC
meeting.
The average initial rate on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
indexed to the one-year Treasury has increased about 35 basis points
since the September meeting. Portfolio lenders, aided by very low
rates on marginal deposit funds, have boosted the initial discount
on ARMs in an effort to combat the loss of volume stemming from
rising rates and to gain market share. This intense price
competition has held start rates on ARMs below those on the one-year
Treasuries. Until recently, the ARM spread series, which dates back

to late 1983, had been negative only briefly in 1984 and for a
longer period in late 1988 and early 1989 (chart) Such aggressive
pricing helped raise the ARM share of mortgage originations to 46
percent in September, the highest level since June 1989 (chart).
An important trend in the ARM market is the growing use of
contracts that have fixed-rate periods lasting several years, after
which the mortgages become one-year adjustable loans. These
mortgages are attractive to home buyers because of somewhat lower
rates than those available on fixed-rate mortgages. Reflecting this
development, the average number of months before the first scheduled
rate adjustment on ARMs has more than doubled from nineteen months
in September 1992 to forty-eight months in September 1994, according
to estimates provided by the Federal Housing Finance Board.
Another manifestation of heightened competition in the market
for home mortgages has been a softening of nonrate credit terms.
The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on conventional home mortgages
(FRM and ARM) at a cross-section of lenders climbed from just below
77 percent in January to a series high of nearly 81 percent in
August, and remained near that level in September (chart). This
increase likely reflects both concessions made by lenders in an
effort to retain market share and efforts to provide financing to
marginally qualified borrowers by easing downpayment requirements.
Loan-to-value ratios rose more rapidly for mortgages on existing
homes and for mortgage loans at the lower end of the size spectrum,
market segments where demand by buyers seeking starter homes is
concentrated.
The growth in ARMS likely contributed to recent strength in
mortgage loans at commercial banks where real estate loans rose at a
9-1/2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. In contrast,
because mortgage bankers are not portfolio lenders, they have less

flexibility to adjust standard loan terms, and their activity likely
has slowed, as evidenced by continued low net issuance of pass-
through securities in the secondary mortgage markets (chart).
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit slowed in September from
the exceptionally rapid August pace; for the third quarter, consumer
credit grew at a 15 percent annual rate based on revised data.3
The third-quarter gain was only slightly below that of the second
quarter, which was the strongest advance of the current economic
expansion. Consumer credit growth has reached the 15-to-20 percent
range attained at some point during most previous expansions
(chart). Such levels were reached sooner in past upswings, but an
unusually slow pickup in spending on consumer durables in the early
stages of this expansion kept credit growth sluggish for several
quarters. In recent months, however, outlays for autos and other
durable goods have been brisk, providing a significant boost to
credit expansion.
The continued vigor in consumer credit during the third quarter
was accounted for by growth rates of 16 percent in the automobile
component and 18 percent in revolving credit (primarily credit card
debt). Recent growth in auto credit has tracked new-car sales much
as it has in the past. Part of the strength in revolving credit
stems from the continued proliferation of programs that tie rebates
and other rewards to the volume of charges made to an account. The
change in payment habits that these programs encourage adds
uncertainty to the interpretation of the growth in consumer credit.
3. The finance company component of consumer credit has been
revised from June 1990 through August 1994 to reflect both a new
estimation procedure and revised reports. Recent call report data
for savings institutions and credit unions have been incorporated:
seasonal factors have also been recalculated. The net effects of
the revisions on overall consumer installment credit were small; the
largest revision for any year was to lower overall growth 0.4
percentage points in 1993.

III-22
Clearly, a cardholder has an incentive to run as many transactions
as possible through an account that rewards charge volume. Such
usage tends to increase the measured level of aggregate outstandings
because at any given time the balance in an account used this way
will be larger than if fewer charges were passing through the
account. As a rough estimate, the staff believes that as much
as a third of the recent growth in revolving credit can be
reasonably attributed to the use of credit cards to complete
transactions in order to obtain volume-related incentive benefits.
4. Even if an account is figured into the aggregate on the day a
"full" payment is received, the balance may still be large because
of the accumulation of charges debited to the account between the
time of billing and the receipt of the payment by the card issuer.

Exports of goods and services rebounded in August; the increase
was spread among automotive products to Canada (primarily parts),
aircraft (partially offsetting a seasonal drop in July),
agricultural products (largely soybeans), machinery, and consumer
goods. The July-August average level of exports increased at a 2
percent annual rate relative to the second quarter. Large gains in
machinery and consumer goods mostly reflected increases in quantity,
while an increase in industrial supplies was almost entirely due to
increases in prices.
The level of imported goods and services jumped in August,
primarily in automotive vehicles from Canada. The July-August
average level rose at nearly a 4 percent annual rate relative to the

second quarter. The strongest gains were in automotive products,
industrial supplies, and oil.
The quantity of oil imports remained above 10.0 mb/d for the
third consecutive month in August as a result of higher consumption.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that while
consumption eased and production rose in September, inventory
accumulation accelerated with inventories at above normal levels at
end-September. While imports are projected to decline from the
historic highs of the past three months, they are expected to remain
above 9 mb/d in September. During the third quarter, the value of
oil imports is projected to have risen from second quarter levels,
as both the price and quantity of imported oil rose.
Prices of Merchandise Imports and Exports
The price of imported oil rose a modest $0.10 per barrel --
averaging $16.65 per barrel in August -- after rising $1.00 per
barrel each month since April. In September, OPEC production
increased as Nigerian production rebounded from its strike-depressed
levels and as North Sea oilfield maintenance ended. Consequently,
the price of imported oil fell, on the order of $1.00 per barrel, to
about $15.60 per barrel. During the third quarter, the price of
imported oil should average approximately $1.65 per barrel above the
second quarter price.
Spot oil prices (West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) rebounded in
late September on the Brazilian oil workers' strike. Prices
continued to firm as Iraqi troops massed near the Kuwaiti border,
but closed as low as $16.95 per barrel when fears of an Iraqi
invasion abated. More recently, the price of WTI strengthened due
to an anticipated increase in refinery demand, as ruptured Houston
pipelines carrying refined petroleum products come back online and

in light of an EPA-mandated switch to reformulated gasoline on
January 1. In addition, new shipping rules to be implemented on
December 28, requiring tankers to prove their ability to compensate
pollution victims in the event of an oil spill, have raised concerns
of possible disruptions in crude shipments to the U.S. As a
consequence, the spot price of WTI has been pushed to 12-week highs,
closing at $18.93 per barrel on November 2. Currently, spot WTI is
trading at $18.33 per barrel.
Prices of nonoil imports rose 0.3 percent in September,
significantly less than in July and August. While there was a sharp
rise in the price of imported industrial supplies in September, the
deceleration of import prices primarily reflected a slowdown in food
prices (largely coffee). For the third quarter as a whole, nonoil
import prices rose at a 5.3 percent annual rate, somewhat faster
than in the second quarter and largely due to prices of industrial
supplies.
Prices of nonagricultural exports increased in September, at
about the same pace that was set in August. For the third quarter,
prices of nonagricultural exports increased at a 4.4 percent annual
rate, well above the rate in the first half of the year and led by
significant increases in prices of industrial supplies. Prices of
agricultural exports moved up in September after three consecutive
monthly declines. Still, prices of agricultural exports fell on
balance in the third quarter; the weaker prices largely reflect the
prospects for bountiful corn and soybean harvests.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Capital inflows through banks slowed markedly in the third
quarter from the heady pace recorded in the second. This smaller
inflow was offset by larger private foreign purchases of U.S.
securities, smaller U.S. purchases of foreign securities, and a

IV-7
substantial increase in foreign official reserve accumulation in the
United States.
Net inflows through banks declined by $28 billion in the third
quarter (line 3 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions
Table). In transactions with non-bank foreigners, U.S. banks (and
securities dealers) on net lent almost $7 billion in the third
quarter after borrowing more than $14 billion in the second,
resulting in a $21 billion reduction in net banking inflows between
the quarters. A substantial portion of this reduction was by U.S.
securities dealers and likely reflects smaller RP financing. In
interbank transactions, U.S. banks brought funds in at about the
same pace as in the second quarter. As shown on line 1 of the
International Banking Data Table, net claims on own foreign offices
and IBFs declined $25 billion in the third quarter, on a monthly-
average basis; almost all of this inflow was at U.S.-chartered banks
and most of it occurred in July and August. Foreign-chartered banks
brought in some funds in July and August, but increased net claims
on own foreign offices in September. Partial data for October
indicate small inflows through foreign-chartered banks and sizable
inflows through U.S.-chartered banks.
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities picked up markedly
in the third quarter (line 4 of the Summary Table). Most of the
pickup was in Treasury securities, which swung from large net sales
in the second quarter to net purchases in the third. Transactions
with the United Kingdom more than account for the swing. Net
purchases of Treasury securities by Japanese residents fell to less
than $1 billion in the third quarter after totaling more than $10
billion in the second. Private foreign purchases of U.S. corporate

and agency bonds remained brisk in the third quarter and foreign
purchases of U.S. equities swung to small net purchases. Japanese
residents continued to acquire U.S. equities in the quarter and more
than account for the total net purchases.
U S. net purchases of foreign securities continued to slow in
the third quarter (line 5). However, the recorded slowing in net
equity purchases is exaggerated by the aquisition of Syntex
(technically a Panamanian company) by Roche (Swiss), which was
recorded as a $5 billion sale by U.S. holders to Panama. Elsewhere,
U S. purchases of European equities rose in the quarter; in Japan,
U.S. residents on net sold equities, after purchasing more than $4
billion in the second quarter.
Capital inflows through official reserve accumulation slowed in
August and September, but were still up sharply for the third
quarter as a whole (line 1). Inflows from G-10 countries slowed in
the quarter while OPEC and other countries swung from net outflows
in the second quarter to net inflows in the third. Partial data for
October from FRBNY show further inflows from G-10 and other
countries.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average foreign exchange value of the dollar,
shown in the chart, declined nearly 1 percent on balance during the
intermeeting period. The dollar declined about 1-1/4 percent on
balance against the mark and 3/4 percent against the yen. During
the early part of the period the dollar fluctuated in a narrow
range, before falling sharply in mid-October. The dollar's mid-
October drop can partially be attributed to the market's pricing in
of the narrow conservative victory in German elections on October
16. However, a large part of the dollar's mid-October decline does
not appear to have a fundamental explanation.

For most of the second half of October the dollar drifted
lower, weakened in part by concerns that the Federal Reserve was
falling behind the curve. The dollar also weakened on comments of
U.S. and foreign officials that called into question the willingness
of U.S. and foreign monetary authorities to support the dollar via
foreign exchange intervention. The dollar rebounded somewhat on
October 28, in response to a lower than expected implicit GDP
deflator for the third quarter. In early November, the dollar began
to decline again, in part in response to the stronger than expected
purchasing managers index for October, and in part in response to
the failure to reach agreement on flat glass during bilateral
U.S./Japan trade talks.
On November 2, after the dollar reached a two-year low of
DM1.4907 and a new postwar low of 96.12, U.S. monetary authorities
intervened, purchasing dollars against marks and yen on November 2
and 3. During the intervention operations on November 2, Treasury
Secretary Bentsen issued a statement indicating that "continuation
of recent foreign exchange trends would be counterproductive for the
United States and the world economy." Over the two days, U.S.
monetary authorities purchased $1.3 billion against marks and $1.3
billion against yen, evenly split between System and Treasury. The
Bank of Japan purchased dollars against yen on both days, but the
intervention operation was not joined by other foreign monetary
authorities.
Following the intervention, the dollar rose 1-1/2 percent but
then gave up about one-half of these gains ahead of U.S. elections
on November 8. Following the U.S. election, the dollar moved 1-1/4
percent higher. From the dollar's lows on November 2, the dollar
rose 2-1/2 percent on balance against the mark and 1-3/4 percent on
balance against the yen.

IV-13
Long-term bond yields declined 10 basis points in Germany,
France, and the United Kingdom after the U.S. election. For the
intermeeting period as a whole, the German ten-year bellwether bond
yield declined about 5 basis points. From September 27 through
October 18 the bellwether bond yield declined 30 basis points in
anticipation of a victory by Kohl's coalition. Subsequent to the
German election, however, long-term bond yields rebounded on worries
that the new coalition has too narrow a majority to significantly
pare back the budget deficit. Higher than expected M3 growth in
September may also have contributed to the back-up in long-term
rates. Three-month rates in Germany rose 15 basis points during the
period.
In the United Kingdom, the bellwether bond yield declined 30
basis points on balance. Long-term U.K. rates had declined by more
earlier in the period, in response to both the lower than expected
U.S. September PPI figures, as well as to lower than expected U.K.
September retail price inflation. In the second half of the period,
however, long-term rates rose, on balance, in response to survey
data and September industrial production figures that show the U.K.
economy is continuing to expand at a rapid clip.
Long-term bond yields elsewhere in Europe were mixed, with
yields down 10 to 30 basis points in Belgium and Switzerland, and
unchanged to up about 40 basis points elsewhere. In Italy long-term
rates rose 35 basis points on balance in response to the current
government's political difficulties, as well as to uncertainty over
whether the proposed budget will remain intact as it makes it way
through parliament. In Sweden, long-term rates rose 45 basis points
on rising concerns that voters would reject membership in the

IV-14
European Union in a referendum vote on November 13. Three-month
rates in most European countries were unchanged to up 40 basis
points.
The Japanese ten-year bellwether bond yield rose about 20 basis
points during the intermeeting period reflecting a strengthening
Japanese economy. Three-month rates in Japan were about unchanged
during the period. Call money rates rose 5 basis points during the
period, and have risen about 15 basis points since mid-August,
suggesting an apparent monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan.
In Canada, the bellwether bond yield rose about 15 basis
points. A part of this rise occurred on disappointment over
government proposals to cut social expenditures that lacked specific
measures. Short-term rates in Canada rose 20 basis points.
U.S. monetary authorities' purchases of $1.3 billion against
marks and $1.3 billion against yen accounted for all U.S.
intervention during the period.
Developmentsin Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic recovery appears to have continued into the third
quarter in the major foreign industrial countries, although probably
at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year. In
continental Europe, where the staff estimates that the cyclical
troughs were reached in early to mid-1993, growth accelerated in the
first half of this year and available data suggest that the
expansions are continuing in the second half. The Japanese recovery
started later and is still relatively weak, but activity appears to
have picked up again in the third quarter following a second-quarter
decline. The economies in the United Kingdom and Canada are still
growing at rates above potential in the third year of the current
recovery.

IV-15
Consumer-price inflation remains generally subdued in most of
the major foreign industrial countries despite the revival in
economic activity. Unemployment rates have either levelled off or
begun to come down, although they are still at relatively high
levels, while wage growth has remained moderate.
Individual country notes. The recovery that began early this
year in Japan is still not firmly established, although the economy
appears be continuing to expand in recent months. Industrial
production generally has continued to trend up, despite a small
decline in September. Growth in housing starts moderated in the
summer, but the July-August average level was still a little above
the second-quarter pace. In addition, new car registrations rose
sharply in August and September, and for the third quarter were
nearly 6 percent above the previous-year level. In general,
consumption was likely boosted in the third quarter by unusually hot
weather and sizable tax rebates. Orders for new machinery rebounded
strongly in the summer months following a sharp decline in the
second quarter and in August were about 4 percent above their
previous year's level.
The labor market remains weak. The unemployment rate rose to 3
percent in the third quarter, slightly above its level in the first
half of the year, while the job offers/applicants ratio fell a bit
in the third quarter. Inflation remains subdued, with the third-
quarter Tokyo CPI slightly below its year-earlier level. (A 0.8
percent increase in the CPI in October was due primarily to
increases in food prices that are expected to be reversed.)
On October 1, the United States and Japan reached agreement in
principle on opening Japan's insurance and public procurement
markets under their economic framework talks. However, no agreement
was obtained regarding the car and car parts markets. The United

IV-16
States has initiated a probe of Japan's replacement parts market
under Section 301, which could lead to sanctions.

In western Germany, economic activity has continued to expand
in recent months, following a substantial increase in real GDP in
the second quarter. Industrial production rose 0.6 percent in the
third quarter according to preliminary September data. (The monthly
pattern this summer was affected by the fact that more holidays fell
in August, and fewer in July, than is usually the case.) A rather
sizable upward revision in the September level of the index is
expected; this would raise the quarterly growth rate to about 1
percent. Capacity utilization in manufacturing also increased again
in the third quarter. On the expenditure side, retail sales for the
months of July and August were 0.4 percent above their second-
quarter level. The unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high,
however, as output growth so far in the recovery has been achieved
mainly through strong productivity gains.
Forward-looking indicators of activity are generally positive,
although there are some indications that the pace of the expansion
may be slowing. Manufacturing orders were up about 2 percent in the
third quarter, less than their average rate of increase in the first
half of the year. Foreign orders showed a particularly sharp

deceleration, rising at a rate of about 1 percent in the third
quarter following increases averaging 4-1/2 percent in the first
half, while domestic orders continued to rise at a moderate pace.
Production plans in manufacturing rose sharply in the first half of
the year and remained at a high level in the third quarter.
Similarly, firms' assessment of their inventory situation continued
to improve over the summer, although at a slower rate than earlier
in the year.
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index has shown a
gradual deceleration this year, to 2.8 percent on a year-over-year
basis in October, compared with 3.5 percent last January. Wage
moderation has been a significant factor in the slowdown in the
inflation rate, as earnings per hour rose a little less than 2
percent in the year ending in August, about half the rate of
increase in the previous year. Import prices (n.s.a.) rose in
September but were still only about 2 percent above the previous-
year level.
Production in eastern Germany has continued to expand at a
rapid rate, with industrial production in August up 14 percent from
its year-earlier level. Orders for manufactured goods have also
continued to rise and were 26 percent above their previous-year

IV-18
level in August. Most of the strength continues to be in domestic
orders, although foreign orders also showed an increase in August.
The unemployment rate fell in October to 13.3 percent, 2 percentage
points below its year-earlier level.
In France, monthly indicators for the third quarter suggest
that GDP growth continued at its rapid second-quarter pace. The
July/August average of industrial production was 2.3 percent above
its second-quarter level, roughly the same size as the increase
registered in the second quarter. Much of this summer's strength in
output was in construction and autos, which benefited from temporary
government subsidies. Consumption of manufactured goods (one-third
of total consumption) rose 1.5 percent in the third quarter, similar
to the second-quarter gain. Most of this increase occurred early in
the quarter, as auto sales rose. Expenditures then fell back along
with a drop in auto sales in September, as the impact of the subsidy
wore off.

INSEE's October business survey showed that production of
other consumer goods remained strong, while business confidence
continued to improve. Foreign orders were particularly strong, but
orders for capital goods remained weak. The consumer price index
(n.s.a.) rose in September for the first time in several months
largely as a result of an increase in food prices. Despite this

IV-19
increase, year-over-year inflation slowed to 1.6 percent in
September, compared with 1.7 percent in the previous month.
The unemployment rate rose back to its peak level of 12.7
percent in September. The increase was primarily due to a sharp
rise in labor force participation, as employment continued to
improve. The labor ministry suggested that this rise was due to
"discouraged workers" reentering the labor market in response to
signs of economic recovery.
In the United Kingdom, the pace of real non-oil GDP growth
slowed to 2.7 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter, following
increases averaging 4 percent in the first half of the year. The
slowdown was most apparent in the manufacturing sector, while
activity in the services and construction sectors accelerated.
Other indicators also suggest that the underlying momentum in
the U.K. economy remains strong. Industrial production, which
paused in July and August owing to sharp drops in oil production and
refining, rebounded strongly in September. Retail sales were
brisker than expected in September, and the unemployment rate
continued to fall. In October, the latest CBI quarterly survey of
British businesses again pointed to increased optimism about
production plans, investment spending, and export orders. The
survey reported that rates of capacity utilization, already well
above their long-run average levels, continued to rise in October.
The October Purchasing Managers' Survey also showed that the
manufacturing sector continues to grow rapidly and that purchasing
managers, expecting a further rise in prices, are building up extra
stocks in anticipation.
In September, targeted inflation, measured as 12-month changes
in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, fell to 2
percent, the lowest rate in over 25 years. However, producers'

IV-20
input prices (n.s.a.) have risen significantly in recent months. In
its November inflation report, the Bank of England said that the

outlook for inflation has improved since the previous quarterly

current level.
In Italy, the recovery that began late last year gathered
momentum in the second quarter. Real GDP rose nearly 6 percent at
an annual rate, as domestic demand surged on the strength of
inventory accumulation. For the first time in over two years, net
exports made a negative contribution to growth as exports declined
and imports grew at a rate of nearly 10 percent (SAAR).

rose. Consumer and business confidence remained at high levels.

On September 30, the Berlusconi government submitted its
proposed 1995 budget to Parliament. By trimming 50 trillion lire
(nearly 3 percent of GDP) from the baseline budget deficit, the
proposal would reduce the deficit from 9.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to
8 percent in 1995.
In Canada, indicators for the third quarter suggest that
economic activity increased at a robust pace. Industrial
production, factory shipments, and new orders remained strong
through August. The average volume of retail sales for July and
August increased only slightly over the second-quarter average, but
both business and consumer confidence strengthened. The decrease in
employment in October was concentrated in part-time jobs, while
full-time employment edged up following strong gains in the third
quarter. Excluding the effects of recent tax cuts, 12-month
consumer price inflation was 1.6 percent over the quarter.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity appears strong in major developing countries
and countries in transition, with the exceptions of Venezuela and
Russia.
In Mexico, strong growth in industrial output suggests a
further recovery in economic activity while inflation has continued
to decline. In Brazil, growth has been strong while inflation has
risen. In Argentina, economic activity has been robust, and
inflation has stayed low. In China, rapid growth has been
accompanied by persistently high inflation. In Taiwan, growth has
been steady while a rise in inflation reflects the temporary effects
of typhoons last summer. In Korea, growth remains high, and
reducing inflation has become a focus of macroeconomic policy.
Economic problems continue to plague Venezuela and Russia. In
Venezuela, economic activity continues to contract while inflation
has risen. In Russia, the ruble has plunged against the dollar,
inflation has risen, and real GDP continues to contract.
Individual country notes. In Mexico on September 24,
representatives of government, business, and labor renewed the
annual social pact--known as the pacto--that has been used to guide
inflation down since 1987. The new pact sets ambitious goals for
1995, including roughly 4 percent real GDP growth, 4 percent
consumer price inflation, and a balanced budget. It provides a
number of tax incentives for investment, a rebate for low-income
workers, and continued federal subsidies. The new pact commits the
government to continue devaluing the "lower" limit of the exchange
rate band by .0004 pesos per day, or by about 4 percent annually.
In view of the downward pressure on the peso earlier this year, as
well as growing concerns that the peso was overvalued, some
observers had anticipated that the depreciation of the "lower" limit

IV-26
might be accelerated to give the peso more room to move in the event
of future pressures.
Industrial production in July was 4 5 percent above its year-
earlier level, suggesting further recovery of economic activity. In
early November, President Salinas predicted that real GDP growth
would reach 4 percent in the second half of this year, which would
be well above the first half's 2.2 percent pace. Consumer price
inflation has continued to decline, registering 6.7 percent on a 12-
month basis in September.
Mexico's merchandise trade deficit in the January-August period
was $12.1 billion, well above its year-earlier level of $9.3
billion, reflecting a 17 percent growth in exports and a 20 percent
growth in imports over the period. Largely as a result, Mexico's
current account deficit for the first half of this year registered
$14.2 billion, up from an $11.4 billion deficit in the first half of
1993.
international reserves were $17.2 billion as of end-October, well
below their end-1993 level of $25.1 billion.
In Brazil, economic activity expanded rapidly after a monetary
reform was implemented on July 1 as part of the stabilization
program called the Piano Real. In Sao Paulo, industrial sales in
September were 33 percent above a year earlier in real terms.
Growth in retail sales appears to have slowed since the central bank
imposed credit controls in October to dampen aggregate demand and
mitigate inflationary pressures. Monthly inflation was less than 2
percent in September, compared with 50 percent in June, but it rose
slightly in October and is expected to rise further in November.
The government also accelerated the schedule of tariff reductions

IV-27
under the Mercosur trade agreement, which is to go into effect
January 1, 1995, to contain inflationary pressures in the tradable
goods sector.
In July, the central bank committed only to maintain the new
currency at no lower than one real per dollar. However, since
September, the central bank has intervened, apparently in small
amounts, to ease upward pressures on the real; as of November 8, the
real-dollar exchange rate was 0.83. (Estimates of Brazil's holdings
of international reserves in October ranged from $41 billion to $43
billion.) In October, the central bank also imposed taxes on
capital inflows and removed some controls on capital outflows. In
recent months, the rapid expansion in the monetary base, combined
with the uncertainty about the prospects for fiscal reform, has
raised concerns that the central bank is losing monetary control.
In October, a governmental decree raised the ceiling on the central
bank's fourth-quarter target for the monetary base by 70 percent.
Brazil's cumulative trade surplus for the year through
September was $10.7 billion, little changed from last year,
reflecting a 12 percent growth in exports and a 13 percent growth in
imports.
Former Finance Minister Henrique Cardoso won the October 3
presidential election by a wide margin and takes office January 1.
Cardoso's victory owed to the plunge in inflation after the monetary
reform was enacted in July; the monetary reform was part of the
anti-inflation program that was launched almost a year ago when
Cardoso was finance minister.
In Argentina, growth appears strong while inflation remains
low. Industrial production during the first eight months of 1994
was up 5.3 percent from a year earlier. Consumer prices were 3.7
percent higher in September than a year earlier. The cumulative

IV-28
trade deficit for the year through August was $3.8 billion, compared
to its year-earlier level of $1.5 billion, reflecting a 36 percent
growth in imports and a 16 percent growth in exports.
Argentina and the IMF agreed to forego the last two
disbursements of its March 1992 three-year Extended Fund Facility,
and the program will expire as scheduled. The agreement resulted
from Argentina's desire not to have to meet Fund fiscal performance
criteria in upcoming months (1995 is an election year). In recent
months, the budget surplus has shrunk and is expected to shift to a
deficit. In August, the government discontinued auctions of three-
month, peso- and dollar-denominated Treasury bills after rejecting
all bids several times, but has recently indicated that it will
resume the auctions before the end of the year. The government also
announced that the privatization of all airports was underway; it is
hoped that the asset sales will reduce fiscal pressures over the
short-term.
In Venezuela, the highly expansionary monetary policy followed
by the central bank in recent months has not stopped the decline in
economic activity. The urban unemployment rate reached 13.5 percent
in the third quarter of 1994, up from 9.1 percent the previous
quarter. Consumer price inflation was 5.1 percent in October, up
from 4.0 percent in September and monthly rates of about 3 percent
last year, despite the imposition of price controls in late June.
The cumulative trade deficit for the year through August was
$2.7 billion, down from the deficit of $5.5 billion recorded over
the same period in 1993, reflecting a 31 percent decline in imports
and a 14 percent growth in exports. The fall in imports reflects
weak aggregate demand and strict foreign exchange controls imposed
in June 1994. The central bank's official reserves, excluding gold,
stood at an estimated $8 billion at the end of September.

IV-29
Economic activity in China has been robust and inflation
remains persistently high. In the first three quarters of 1994,
real GDP rose 11.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, down
from 13.4 percent growth in the first three quarters of 1993. In
both September and October 1994, however, industrial production rose
26 percent from a year earlier, the highest monthly growth rates
since December 1993. In the twelve months ending in September 1994,
retail prices rose 25 percent while urban prices rose 28 percent.
In early November, the People's Bank of China officially
announced monetary statistics for the first three quarters of 1994.
Although Chinese authorities have sporadically announced monetary
statistics in the past, the new figures provide greater detail than
previous announcements, and the authorities have promised to provide
such figures regularly in the future. At the end of the third
quarter, M2 was 37 percent higher than a year earlier while M1 was
33 percent higher.
In the first three quarters of 1994, China ran a trade surplus
of $1.4 billion, compared with a deficit of $7.0 billion for the
same period of 1993, reflecting export growth of 30 percent and
import growth of 15 percent over the period. Foreign exchange
reserves nearly doubled over the first nine months of 1994, reaching
$40 billion at end-September.
In Taiwan, industrial production in September was 5.4 percent
above a year earlier. Consumer prices in September were 6.7 percent
higher than a year earlier, reflecting largely the temporary effects
of typhoons during the summer. The trade surplus for the January-
October period was $6.0 billion, down slightly from its year-earlier
level, reflecting a 7 percent growth in exports and an 8 percent
growth in imports over the period.

IV-30
In Korea, economic activity remains very robust. Manufacturing
output expanded by 8.7 percent in the third quarter from the same
quarter last year. Reducing inflation has become a principal focus
of macroeconomic policy. Consumer prices rose by 5.7 percent in
October from a year earlier, compared with a 5 1 percent rise in
October 1993.
Merchandise exports increased by 12 percent in the first nine
months of 1994, with a substantial fraction of the increase
accounted for by higher exports of technologically sophisticated
manufactured goods. However, merchandise imports rose by 18 percent
over the same period, mainly because of extremely rapid growth in
imports of capital goods. Hence, the current account deficit for
the first nine months of this year widened to $4.4 billion, from
$0.7 billion a year earlier.
The Korean authorities recently announced that the ceiling on
foreign participation in the equity market will be raised from 10
percent to 12 percent of a company's outstanding stock effective
December 1, and to 15 percent in 1995.
In Russia, loose monetary policy, a deteriorating fiscal
situation, and resulting increases in inflation expectations caused
the ruble to plunge against the dollar by 17 percent during
September and 14 percent during October. The October decline was
also accompanied by significant volatility; the ruble fell by 22
percent on October 11 but rebounded by 25 percent two days later.
The Russian currency has since depreciated by about 1 percent a
week. On November 9, the ruble-dollar exchange rate on the MICEX
auction closed at 3102.
The ruble's plunge generated considerable political fallout.
President Yeltsin asked Parliament to dismiss Central Bank of Russia
Chairman Gerashchenko; in response, Gerashchenko resigned. Yeltsin

IV-31
has nominated CBR Deputy Chairman Tatyana Paramonova as the new
chairman of the central bank. Yeltsin also fired acting Finance
Minister Dubinin, replacing him on November 4 with Vladimir Panskov.
Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin resigned in protest over Panskov's
nomination, since Shokhin was not consulted beforehand. Yeltsin has
since promoted Deputy Prime Minister Chubais to First Deputy Prime
Minister; Chubais will apparently assume the bulk of Shokhin's
former duties.
Monthly inflation in October was 15 percent, up sharply from 8
percent in September and 5 percent in August, apparently reflecting
loose economic policies and the weakening of the ruble. It is now
uncertain whether the Russian government will reduce monthly
inflation to 7 percent by December, the target stipulated in
Russia's Systemic Transformation Facility with the IMF.
According to Russian official statistics, real GDP during the
first nine months of 1994 contracted by 16 percent, compared with
the same period last year, and industrial production was 23 percent
below its year-earlier level. These figures, however, fail to
capture the burgeoning growth of the private sector.
