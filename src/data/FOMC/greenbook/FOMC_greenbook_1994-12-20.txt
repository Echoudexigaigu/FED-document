scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy shows every sign of continued brisk growth,
Payroll employment surged in November and manufacturing output
posted another substantial gain. Consumer spending has remained
robust; and consumer sentiment moved up to the highest levels since
before the last recession. Business investment in both equipment
and nonresidential structures appears to be rising at a rapid clip
Despite substantial ongoing inventory accumulation, firms do not
thus far appear to be overstocked.
Although prices of industrial materials and intermediate
supplies have continued to post large increases, recent increases
in the "core" CPI have been quite moderate. In addition, tighter
labor markets have yet to generate a substantial firming of wages.
Labor Market Developments
Nonfarm payroll employment jumped 350,000 in November,
following a gain of 164,000 in October Although the average
workweek of private production or nonsupervisory workers fell back
in November from a high October level total hours look to be headed
toward a growth rate of around 4-1/2 percent (annual rate) in the
fourth quarter In the household survey, the unemployment rate fell
1another 0.2 percentage point in November to 5.6 percent Since
January, the jobless rate has fallen 1 1 percentage points, the
largest ten-month drop since 1984.
Private payrolls expanded 324,000 in November, with more than
one-third of the increase in the goods-producing sector
Manufacturing recorded another sizable advance, showing widespread
production gains throughout both durable and nondurable goods
1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that its
research suggests that the introduction of the new Current
Population Survey and new weights based on the 1990 Census raised
the unemployment rate 0.2 percentage point beginning in January
1994.

industries. In construction, employment was up 71,000 in November,
reflecting increases in all three major components.2 According
to the BLS, some of the employment growth in construction likely
reflected a bounceback from a level that had been depressed by heavy
rains in the Southeast during the survey week in October. In
addition, the November survey week came relatively early in the
month, so the estimates for November may incorporate fewer seasonal
construction layoffs than usual.
The private service-producing sector added 204.000 jobs in
November, following an increase of 137,000 in October. Gains last
month were uneven. Hiring in retail trade was sluggish, perhaps
because the early survey week missed some temporary Christmas-season
workers who normally are picked up in the November survey. At
service establishments, net hiring increased a bit in November;
rapid growth in personnel supply resumed in November after a pause
in October. Elsewhere, renewed hiring in trucking and warehousing
boosted transportation payrolls by 18,000 in November.
Employment as measured by the household survey rose 372,000 in
November, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent. Jobless
rates declined for men and for teenage women. In addition, the
number of long-term unemployed dropped noticeably. On net, the
labor force rose 100,000, and the participation rate was unchanged
at 66.8 percent.
Other indicators are also consistent with robust labor market
activity. The Conference Board's help-wanted index jumped 11 points
in October to its highest level since July 1990,3 and weekly
initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained in the

320,000 to 340,000 range, a level consistent with another sizable
gain in employment in December. Moreover, the Manpower Inc. index
of net hiring plans for the next quarter rose to its highest level
since 1989, with notable strength evident in construction,
manufacturing, and trade.
Despite increasing anecdotal reports of labor shortages, recent
aggregate measures of wage growth have remained in the moderate
range that has prevailed for some time. Average hourly earnings of
production or nonsupervisory workers fell 0.2 percent in November,
partly offsetting the October gain of 0.6 percent. This measure of
wage growth has picked up somewhat in a few sectors, notably
construction and services. For the economy as a whole, hourly
earnings rose 2.6 percent over the past twelve months--1/4
percentage point faster than the pace over the twelve months ending
in November 1993.
Industrial Production
Led by continued increases in manufacturing output, the
industrial production index rose 0.5 percent in November, following
a revised gain of 0.5 percent in October. With output growth
running faster than the pace of capacity expansion, the rate of
industrial capacity utilization moved up 0.2 percentage point, to
84.7 percent.
Motor vehicle assemblies rose to 12.3 million units at an
annual rate in November, somewhat below planned output at the
beginning of the month but still well above October's rate.
Moreover, current schedules show a sizable increase in assemblies at

last Greenbook because of the annual revisions to the production,
capacity, and capacity utilization indexes.

the turn of the year; even assuming a typical production
shortfall, the motor vehicles and parts industry should make a solid
contribution to overall IP gains in coming months. The ramp-up in
motor vehicle output may be motivated in part by the current low
level of dealer stocks of automobiles and light trucks relative to
the recent sales pace. Days' supply for automobiles and light
trucks remained somewhat short of the level of sixty-five days that
the industry considers "comfortable."

Unlike October's widespread output gains, last month's
production increases were concentrated in durable goods industries,
where output climbed 1.1 percent Among nondurable industries,
petroleum and rubber posted large advances.
Capacity constraints do not appear to be leading to much
slowing in manufacturing activity. The following table reports
recent production growth rates in three manufacturing groups. The
first group includes those two-digit SIC industries for which
factory operating rates had, by August, exceeded their 1988-89

production at GM may be overstated for the first quarter by about
0.3 million units. If this is correct, total schedules for the

13 3 million that appears in the table.

which August rates remained below their last cyclical peaks but
above their 1967-93 averages.7 The third group includes those
for which August rates were below their long-term averages. The
first column reports the average growth rate of production over the
past year; the next three report growth rates in the last three
months. The table shows that those industries with high operating
rates in August have continued to grow at a robust pace.

Outside of manufacturing, activity has declined in the past
couple of months. Mining production fell another 0.6 percent in
November, after a 0.4 percent retreat in October. Utilities output
dropped 1.6 percent in November, the fifth straight monthly decline.
However, short-run movements in utilities output often follow the
weather, which was unusually mild over the past few months.
Owing to the run-up in manufacturing production, the factory
operating rate rose one-half point, to 84.4 percent, in November.
The utilization rate was reduced about one-half percentage point in

the recent revision, in large part reflecting data showing that
manufacturing investment, and thus growth of the net capital stock,
was stronger than previously thought. Still, the primary processing
utilization rate, at 89.2 percent, is now above its peak in the late
1980s, while the advanced processing utilization rate, at
82.5 percent, is only one percentage point below its peak.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles in November held near the strong
pace that has prevailed since August. Sales were 15.2 million units
at an annual rate (FRB seasonals), as a slight gain among
North American-produced vehicles mostly offset small declines in
sales of imports.
Several factors that have affected recent sales in selected
segments of the light vehicle market are likely to prevail through
the turn of the year. Within light trucks, an ongoing year-end
sales race between GM and Ford has boosted light truck sales since
September. And although sales of sport-utility vehicles continue to
rebound in the wake of last summer's availability problems, the pace
of production since August may not have been sufficient to eliminate
the pent-up demand that accumulated while these vehicles were in
short supply.
For automobiles, both industry sources and the November data
suggest that GM's production problems continue to hold down sales of
small cars. Since last March, sales of GM's popular Cavalier and
Sunbird models have plunged about 400,000 units as an extended
changeover and slow ramp-up have curtailed supply. Although a
substantial incentive program for Toyota's small cars in August
siphoned off some of the pent-up demand for GM's small vehicles,
sales of small cars have continued to decline since then. GM's auto

assembly plans for the first quarter show a sharp rebound in small-

Personal Income and Consumption
The latest data on retail sales point to a large gain in
consumer spending in the fourth quarter, supported by strong
employment and income growth and substantial recent gains in
consumer sentiment.
Total nominal retail sales increased 1.2 percent in November,
following an upward-revised gain of 1.3 percent in October.
Spending in the retail control group, which excludes sales at
automotive dealers and at building material and supply stores, rose
0.7 percent in November; revisions to previous months were small and
offsetting. Within the retail control category, nominal sales at
most types of stores were up in November. The retail sales data and
the available information about prices suggest that the November
level of real spending on goods other than motor vehicles was
1.9 percent above the third-quarter average, not at an annual rate.
Consumer spending on services has also advanced solidly,
growing 0.4 percent in October. Outlays for energy services
rebounded somewhat from their September level, which was held down
by unusually mild weather. Gains were widespread among other
services, with the largest increases occurring in transportation and
personal business services; as a whole, spending on non-energy
services was 0.6 percent higher in October than the third-quarter
average.
Real disposable personal income grew rapidly in October,
advancing 1.3 percent and pushing the personal saving rate up to
4.7 percent in that month. Roughly two-thirds of the growth in
disposable income was attributable to a sizable gain in wages and
salaries, including large bonuses paid to workers in the motor

vehicles industry. In addition, October income was boosted by large
government payments to farmers who had voluntarily put farmland in
the Conservation Reserve program. In November, farm proprietors'
income should drop back, and the most recent labor market data
suggest that wages and salaries will be little changed.
Nonetheless, real disposable income appears likely to register a
gain in the neighborhood of 6 percent (annual rate) in the fourth
quarter.
The Michigan Survey Research Center's index of consumer
sentiment increased sharply in the first part of December.
Consumers' assessments of current conditions improved solidly, and
the expected future conditions index jumped up sharply; if its
early-December level is maintained for the remainder of the month,
it will be the most favorable reading since 1984. The latest
Conference Board report indicated a sharp improvement in sentiment
in November. Before November, the Conference Board index of
consumer sentiment had been depressed relative to its pre-recession
values; the November increase put the series in line with its
readings in the first half of 1990.
Housing Markets
The fundamental determinants of housing activity have weakened
substantially since late last year, but indicators of sales and
production have not yet shown a commensurate drop. The most recent
readings gave mixed signals about the current direction of activity
in the housing market.
Single-family starts fell 7 percent in October, to 1.14 million
units, the lowest figure since February, and the strong initial
estimate for September was revised down moderately. However, the
level of single-family permits, which are measured with considerably
less statistical error than are starts, has been essentially

unchanged in recent months, and at its current level suggests that
the October level of starts may understate the true volume of
construction activity.
Sales of new homes rose 1.3 percent in October, to 726,000
units at an annual rate, the highest level since December 1993. The
September-October data on sales and single-family construction, on
average, placed the two series in a typical alignment after a period
when sales were unusually low relative to starts. Sales of existing
homes edged up in October, but the September-October average sales
level stood below the pace in months before September.
The survey indicators of housing activity have been mixed
recently, but all remain substantially below the favorable readings
registered early this year. Consumer attitudes about homebuying
conditions improved slightly in early December after a sharp drop in
November, while builders' assessments of new home sales continued to
worsen in November. Applications for home mortgage financing rose
somewhat on a month-average basis in November, after dropping
sharply earlier in the year.
After approaching a 28-year low early this year, the cash-flow
burden of fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) financing has risen noticeably
in recent months, although the effect of the higher FRM rates may
have been cushioned somewhat by a shift toward adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs), which depository institutions have offered with
large initial rate discounts. According to the Federal Housing
Finance Board, the ARM share of newly originated conventional home
mortgages rose in October to 49 percent, the highest proportion
since May 1989.
Since the last FOMC meeting, however, typical ARM rates have
increased about 55 basis points, while rates on FRMs have fallen

94 basis points. This narrowing FRM-ARM spread may prompt more
homebuyers to opt for the less-risky fixed-rate alternative--and it
likely will disqualify some would-be buyers who can qualify for
loans only if the monthly payments are lower in the early years.
Multifamily housing starts rose 4.8 percent in October, to
282,000 units. In general, multifamily starts have been trending up
recently, reflecting emerging demand pressures in some markets.
Business Fixed Investment
Investment in producers' durable equipment evidently has
continued to expand rapidly this quarter. Shipments of nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft were up a bit in October after
advancing sharply in the two previous months, yielding an October
level that was 2-1/4 percent above the third-quarter average.
Nominal shipments of computing equipment have been very strong in
recent months, rising in October to a level 5-1/2 percent above
their average for the third quarter. Reports in the trade press
suggest that both business and consumer demand for PCs,
workstations, and related equipment is surging.10 Shipments of
other capital goods were also at a very high level in October.
Moreover, the continuing strength in new orders for both computers
and other capital equipment, along with growing backlogs for
computers and office equipment, suggests that shipments will rise
further in coming months.
9. The majority of ARMs are linked to the one-year Treasury rate.
10. Intel announced recently that under certain conditions its
Pentium microprocessor might malfunction. This problem has received
a great deal of attention in the press, but our industry contacts do
not believe that, thus far, it has had much of a depressing effect
on computer purchases, owing to the small share of Pentium machines
in total business computer purchases. However, as a result of its
own research showing that the problem is more severe than Intel has
indicated. IBM announced that it will suspend shipments of machines
with the defective chips. These developments have caused
uncertainty, which may lead some customers to postpone purchases for
a few months until the situation is clarified.

As for transportation equipment, healthy business demand helped
push up light vehicle sales in October and November. In addition,
heavy truck sales shot up in October and November, putting the
average pace in the two months roughly 10 percent (not annual rate)
above their third-quarter rate. The demand for heavy trucks has
been very high throughout 1994, but capacity constraints have slowed
deliveries, and orders have backed up considerably. Several truck
manufacturers report that new capacity is coming on line in the
fourth quarter, which should help them whittle away at the large
backlog. Aircraft outlays and backlogs have continued to fall.
Domestic shipments dropped 35 percent from December 1993 to
September 1994, and this downtrend has continued into the fourth
quarter. Boeing's domestic orders, which were very slow in 1993,
have remained weak so far this year.
The continued strength of spending on producers' durable
equipment is broadly consistent with recent readings on several
fundamental determinants of investment. Despite higher interest
rates, the cost of capital continues to be quite favorable for
equipment, primarily because prices for capital goods have not
increased very rapidly on average--owing importantly to the drop in
computer prices. In addition, the acceleration of business output
continues to provide a positive, albeit diminishing, stimulus to
investment, and corporate cash flow has been growing rapidly.
Outlays for nonresidential structures have continued to advance
strongly. Construction put-in-place for buildings increased
1-1/2 percent in October and has been on a modest but steady uptrend
for almost two years. The strength is concentrated in the "other
commercial" sector (which includes retail outlets) and, to a lesser
11. The accelerator effect relates the lagged change in growth
rates to investment. While growth in nonfarm business output
excluding housing (called "Business Output" in the chart) has
continued strong, the change in growth rates has declined.

extent, in the "industrial" category; office and institutional
construction (which includes structures related to health care and
private educational buildings) have been only inching up. In the
aggregate, leading indicators of future construction have also been
solid. Although permits for nonresidential construction dropped
back in October, after smoothing through the monthly volatility they
still appear to be on a healthy uptrend.
Drilling and mining is one sector where investment has been
declining, as relatively low natural gas prices and substantial
inventories have depressed drilling activity. The slowdown in
activity in this sector may well be intensifying. Rotary drilling
rigs-in-use dropped about 5 percent in October, after declining
1 percent in the third quarter. In addition, the Baker-Hughes index
of footage drilled registered a large drop in October.
Inventories
The recent robust business inventory expansion may have
continued into October. Census data available at this point show
that inventories in manufacturing and wholesale trade rose in
October at a $33.7 billion annual rate, only a bit less than the
rapid $36.4 billion pace posted during the third quarter. The brisk
rise in stocks appears to reflect desired accumulation in light of
favorable sales expectations and concerns about prompt availability
of supplies.
In manufacturing, the pace of stockbuilding picked up again,
with an accumulation of $17.5 billion (annual rate) in October
following little net change in the preceding two months. The
pattern of manufacturers' inventory investment in October was quite
similar to that observed through much of this year; a sizable
portion of the increase was in stocks at producers of capital goods,
reflecting the continued strength in demand for business equipment.

In particular, inventories at producers of computers and computer
accessories, office machinery, and telecommunications equipment--
industries where bookings have been robust for much of this year and
the backlog of unfilled orders has been relatively high--accounted
for the bulk of the October buildup. By stage of processing,
investment in stocks of materials and supplies posted another
sizable rise in October following a string of increases since
January. In contrast, factories have seen little net accumulation
in inventories of finished goods since July.
Merchant wholesalers continued to build their inventories at a
brisk pace in October; excluding motor vehicles, wholesale stocks
expanded at a $12 billion annual rate in October, about the same
pace as in September. The pattern of accumulation was similar to
that of the manufacturers, with a significant part of the buildup in
the categories of machinery, professional and business equipment,
and metals.
Non-auto retail inventories seemed well in line with sales at
the end of September, as a sharp August-September rise in
inventories was matched by sales gains, leaving the overall
inventory-sales ratios near trend. Moreover, some of retailers'
stockbuilding in recent months may reflect optimistic expectations
regarding holiday sales.
Federal Sector
Continuing spending restraint combined with rising tax revenues
have contributed to substantial shrinkage of the federal budget
deficit. On a unified basis, the deficit was $32 billion in October
compared with $45 billion a year ago. However, October outlays were
artificially depressed this year by about $6 billion because the
October outlays for defense payrolls, veterans benefits, and SSI
benefits were paid in September. (October 1 fell on a Saturday.)

II-32
After adjusting for this special factor, the October deficit was
down $7 billion from last year, with adjusted outlays up 3 percent
and receipts up 13 percent. Falling payroll-adjusted defense
spending, which was down 12 percent, contributed more than any other
category to the overall spending decline. The strong growth in
receipts was due primarily to a surge in personal withheld taxes and
social insurance taxes, and likely reflected the robust growth in
wages and salaries.
Defense spending for operations and maintenance was a bit below
trend in October after surging in September.2 The September-
October military operations in Haiti were likely sustained primarily
by September spending and by inventories; additional operations and
maintenance expenditures will probably show up in future months as
inventories diminish. Nonetheless, the low operations and
maintenance expenditures in October could signal lower levels of
expenditures for Haiti than were projected by OB.13 In addition,
OMB sources indicate that the Persian Gulf buildup will be reflected
primarily in future defense purchases as fuel supplies are
replenished and equipment is returned to storage.14
OMB and CBO reportedly will lower their estimates of future
federal spending for health programs in their respective fiscal year
1996 budget documents due to be released in early 1995 Last
summer, the average annual growth rate of health spending between
12. Timing of procurement spending also contributed to the year-
over-year decline in payday-adjusted October defense spending.
This year, high procurement spending in September was offset by low
procurement spending in October.
13 OMB estimates that outlays for Haiti were $514 million in
FY1994 and $148 million for October. Estimates for the remainder of
FY1995 are not yet available. In addition, costs associated with
the retention of Cuban refugees are estimated at $119 million for
FY1994 and $243 million for FY1995.
14. Arab countries are expected to finance most or all of the
costs of the Persian Gulf operations via a special defense account,
so that the resource costs will be reflected in offsetting NIPA
purchases and transfers, but not in unified outlays. (Payments into
the special defense account will be scored as a negative outlay.)

II-33
fiscal years 1994 and 1996 was estimated at 10 percent by OMB and 12
percent by CBO, somewhat higher than the 9 percent growth rate
experienced in fiscal 1994 (see chart).15
President Clinton recently proposed a $2 billion emergency
supplemental appropriation for the Defense Department for fiscal
year 1995 to offset the costs of military operations in Haiti and
Bosnia, the setup of a migrant camp for Cuban refugees at Guantanamo
Bay, and the buildup and builddown in the Persian Gulf. Under OBRA-
93 budget rules, emergency spending need not be offset by other
spending reductions. In addition, the President announced that his
fiscal year 1996 budget will request $25 billion more defense
spending over the next five years than was requested in last year's
budget. Increases in non-emergency defense spending through fiscal
year 1998 must be offset by reductions in other discretionary
spending under OBRA-93 budget rules.
Both houses of Congress have approved legislation implementing
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) and providing for offsetting revenue increases and spending
cuts necessitated by the OBRA-93 budgeting rules. The five-year
financing legislation includes $1 billion from spending cuts,
$4 billion from increased tax compliance and changes in the timing
of tax payments, $1 billion from reforms to the operations of the
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, $2 billion from surpluses
attributable to previous legislation, and $4 billion from other
miscellaneous sources. The President signed the legislation on
December 8.
15. OMB revised down its estimates of health spending this past
August but CBO, for the most part, did not. CBO chose to remain
consistent with the assumptions used to cost out the various health
care reform proposals put forward during the 1994 legislative
season.

The President's Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform,
chaired by Senator Kerrey, was scheduled to have voted its
recommendations on December 14. The commission's options, which
were set out in a staff report, include more than seventy-five
measures to restrain entitlement spending or increase federal
revenues. Which options will be chosen and the net impact remain
quite uncertain.
State and Local Government Sector
Available indicators suggest that purchases of goods and
services by state and local governments will post another solid gain
in the fourth quarter. Although the increase in employment in
November largely represented temporary election workers, trend
employment growth in the state and local sector appears to have
firmed a bit in recent months. In addition, real outlays for
structures jumped in October, boosting construction to a level
nearly 5 percent above the third-quarter average. Most categories
of construction spending saw advances in October, with the largest
increase in outlays for educational facilities.
With many states having ended fiscal year 1994 in reasonably
good shape, pressures to raise taxes have abated. Although the
changes in state tax laws made last spring raised revenues, on net,
the increase is forecast by the National Council of State
Legislatures to be only about 1 percent of total collections in
fiscal 1995, the smallest increment since 1988. This development
reflects both a drop in the amount of money raised from tax hikes
and a step-up in tax cuts.
Further reductions in taxes are likely during the 1995
legislative sessions. Four states just elected governors with
ambitious tax-cutting agendas, and a number of others have similar
plans. However, in light of the recent fiscal difficulties in many

of these states, most recent tax-reduction proposals have been
relatively small.
Prices
Although inflation has picked up smartly at the early stages of
processing, thus far this acceleration has not been paralleled in
prices for final goods.16 The PPI for intermediate materials
excluding food and energy increased 4.8 percent in the past twelve
months--more than three percentage points faster than its pace in
the year-earlier period. In contrast, for commodities excluding
food, energy, and tobacco, the PPI for finished goods accelerated
just 0.1 percentage point in the past year, while the corresponding
CPI decelerated about 0.8 percentage point. Nor do the recent data
give a hint of a change in direction. The core PPI rose just
0.1 percent in November, while the CPI excluding food and energy was
up only 0.2 percent.

Intermediate goods prices excluding food and energy advanced at
a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in the past six months--considerably
faster than during the previous six months. The increases were led
by a variety of materials purchased as inputs to manufacturing.
Crude prices have been increasing even faster, and have also picked
16. Logically, there are three possible explanations for the lack
of a pass-through: either producers' margins must have declined,
some other costs (e.g., labor costs) must have declined, or their
productivity must have risen. It is not possible at this stage to
determine the relative importance of these possibilities.

up their pace in the past six months from that of the previous half
year.
Meanwhile, the PPI for finished goods rose 0.5 percent in
November--a sizable increase, but one that only partially offset a
1 percent decline registered over the previous two months. Gasoline
prices increased 4-1/2 percent, likely reflecting temporary
disruptions to supplies from the pipeline rupture in Texas in late
October. Food prices were little changed. Excluding food and
energy, the PPI edged up 0.1 percent after a drop of 0.5 percent in
October. Truck prices declined again in November after a sharp drop
a month earlier, the fallout of an end-of-year sales contest between
Ford and GM. November producer prices were also soft for apparel
and tobacco.
Consumer energy prices rose 0.7 percent in November, led by
increases in gasoline prices as well as gas and electric utility
rates. Although crude oil prices were generally flat over the past
couple of months, retail gasoline prices in November probably were
boosted by temporary supply disruptions following the pipeline
ruptures in the Houston area. For natural gas, consumer prices had
been declining for several months before November, reflecting
pervasive weakness in spot wellhead prices through much of this
year. The November increase in natural gas prices in the CPI
retraced only part of the previous declines.
The prices paid by gasoline wholesalers and consumers are
expected to increase in the near term, reflecting government
mandates for gasoline designed to reduce emissions of carbon
monoxide, benzene, and other pollutants. The reformulated gasoline
had to be stocked at the wholesale level by December 1, and at the
retail level by January 1. The mandate is expected to add six cents
per gallon to wholesale prices and nine cents per gallon to retail

II-40
prices in the approximately one-third of the national market that is
affected; as a result, the mandate is expected to add two and three
cents per gallon respectively to the national averages of wholesale
and retailer prices. The price increase will not appear in the PPI
or CPI, because (contrary to our earlier expectation) the BLS has
ruled that the mandate is a quality improvement.
Consumer food prices were unchanged in October and rose only
slightly in November. Meat and poultry prices were down a bit, on
net, over the two months, and prices of fruits and vegetables rose
moderately. Prices for other foods increased about a tenth of a
percent per month, on average. The twelve-month rise in food prices
held steady at 2.4 percent.
Unlike prices at the earlier stages of processing, price
increases for consumer commodities other than food and energy slowed
a bit over the past year. In November, they increased 0.1 percent
after showing no change a month earlier. Apparel prices continued
to fall, while car prices decreased 0.2 percent and truck prices
were off 0.7 percent. In the past year, however, new car and truck
prices have increased slightly faster than other consumer prices,
while used car prices have well outpaced the consumer market basket,
increasing 1.4 percent in November to a level 6-3/4 percent above a
year ago
Over the past twelve months, non-energy service prices
increased 3.5 percent, compared with 1 3.7 percent rise over the
preceding twelve-month period. Owners' equivalent rent and
residential rent increased 0.3 percent in November, about in line
with the pace over the past year. Medical service prices increased
0.8 percent in November and are up 5 2 percent over the past twelve
months- compared with a 5.9 percent increase during the year-earlier

II-41
period. In contrast, auto finance charges have increased sharply in
recent months, reflecting the rise in interest rates.
The increase in materials prices has been most notable among
industrial commodities. In the past month, prices of industrial
materials increased sharply, with the Journal of Commerce Index of
Industrial Commodities up 1.1 percent. In the past year, this index
has moved up 22 percent. Among industrial metals, particularly
large increases have been registered for copper and steel scrap.
Although prices of tin and zinc fell in the past month, they had
posted large increases in earlier months. Cotton and rubber prices
have risen rapidly in recent months. Plywood prices have declined
6-1/2 percent in the past month but had increased rapidly in earlier
months. In contrast, gold and silver have traded lower in the past
month and are down from their year-earlier levels. Agricultural
prices have shown no clear direction in the past month, but they had
generally fallen over the summer and early fall, reflecting bumper
harvests of corn and soybeans and sizable increases in livestock
production. Coffee prices have weakened substantially of late,
reversing some of the earlier run-up.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The System action announced after the November FOMC meeting--a
75 basis point increase in the discount rate that was fully passed
through to the federal funds rate--was more forceful than generally
anticipated in the markets. Other money market yields firmed in
response, and major commercial banks promptly raised their prime
rates by an equal amount, to 8-1/2 percent. But the large move--and
the unanimous discount rate vote--evidently was taken as a signal
that the Federal Reserve was firmly committed to taking such steps
as might be needed to contain inflation: Rates further out the yield
curve increased only a few basis points, and the thirty-year
Treasury bond yield actually fell on the day of the policy action.
Bond yields continued to move down over the balance of the
period, despite surprising and persistent strength of incoming data.
These data were read as suggesting that considerably tighter policy
was likely to be needed, and short-term rates rose considerably. In
early December, financial markets were disrupted for a time by the
news of Orange County's difficulties. Municipal bond markets were
affected by concerns that other issuers might have similar problems
and that tax-exempt mutual funds would experience accelerated
redemptions. Spreads on federal agency securities widened somewhat
in response to sales of agency issues held as collateral by Orange
County creditors, and the equities of such agencies fell sharply.
After a period of several days, however, as only scattered reports
of other such situations emerged, markets settled down. Mutual
funds generally reported little change in investor interest, with
reports of unusual redemptions limited to money funds that
specialized in California paper. By December 13, both agency and
municipal spreads had returned to levels prior to the Orange County
problems, although individual tax-exempt borrowers, especially those
III-1

III-2
associated with the Orange County pool investors, continued to
experience difficulties. Gross issuance in tax-exempt markets also
was disrupted only briefly.
More broadly, borrowing by businesses and households has
continued at a brisk pace. Long-term bond offerings by nonfinancial
firms remained fairly weak, as these firms have continued to display
a preference for short-term financing; the latter was reflected in
further solid growth of business loans at banks and in commercial
paper issuance. Mortgage lending is estimated to have proceeded
near its third-quarter pace, supported by the firmness of home sales
through October. Consumer credit recorded double-digit growth again
in October.
Bank credit expanded at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent in
November, as robust loan growth once again was partly financed by
run-offs of security holdings. M3 growth continued to be supported
by rapid expansion of large time deposits to help fund bank credit.
M2 rose a little in November, the first monthly increase since July,
lifted by the rapid growth of small time deposits and retail money
funds.
Interest Rates
The rise in short-term rates and drop in bond yields combined
to produce the flattest yield curve (thirty-year minus three-month
rate) since December 1991. Contributing to the upward pressure on
very short-term rates was the approach of year-end. One-month
commercial paper rates, for example, jumped 34 basis points on the
day that maturity first fell in 1995, implying a turn-of-year
premium of almost 3 percentage points. Orange County's chapter 9
bankruptcy filing may have added upward pressure on Treasury yields;
in particular, dealers' efforts to sell the collateral they claimed
when Orange County ran dry of funds may have affected the three- to

five-year sector, where rates are up 20 to 40 basis points over the
intermeeting period.
With the November move, System actions in 1994 have slightly
outpaced the median increase in the federal funds rate in episodes
of policy tightening since 1955 (chart). In those eight prior
periods, the federal funds rate rose just over 2 percentage points
in the first ten months of rising short-term rates, compared with
the 2-1/2 percentage point increase since February 1994. It is the
market reaction in the wake of those policy moves that stands out
more. Short-term market rates rose by a larger amount in the early
stages of tightening this year than the historical record would
suggest. This pattern may partly reflect the System's announced
intention to move to policy "neutrality" early this year, enabling
markets to anticipate further actions. In addition, the incoming
news suggested that aggregate demand was especially strong and the
margin of slack was dwindling rapidly. More recently, though, the
pass-through to the three-month Treasury bill rate, at about 75
percent of the total change in the policy rate, has been similar to
the average experience over the 1955-to-1988 period. Three- and
ten-year note yields have about followed that same pattern: More of
the market response came sooner this time around, but the reaction
looks less anomalous ten months after the onset of tightening.
Municipal Markets
Revelation of the financial difficulties of Orange County
dominated municipal and other financial market news in early
December. The Orange County investment pool managed commingled
assets of 187 municipalities and other agencies, including Orange
County. The fund engaged in repurchase agreements to lever its
$7-1/2 billion in capital into $20 billion in securities, mostly
debt of federally sponsored agencies (specifically, Fannie Mae and

III-5
the Federal Home Loan Banks). With the fund's management betting in
1993 and throughout 1994 that rates would fall (or at least would
not rise much), most of those securities had maturities of five to
twenty years. More than 40 percent of the fund's assets were
structured notes with coupons that vary inversely with short-term
market rates. With interest rates rising fast and the fund deep in
the red, the county and its fellow investors added to their bets
last summer by issuing nearly $1 billion in short-term taxable
notes.
On December 2, the county released to the public an estimate
that its investment fund had lost $1-1/2 billion, or about one-
fifth, of its value. More recent estimates place the size of the
loss at upwards of $2 billion. On December 6, when dealers became
reluctant to roll over maturing repurchase agreements, or demanded
additional collateral, and concerns grew that its own pool investors
would clamor for their funds, Orange County filed for chapter 9
bankruptcy protection; it actually defaulted on $110 million of
taxable notes on December 8. With few exceptions, dealers, who held
$13 billion of collateral provided by Orange County for money lent
to the investment pool under RP agreements, sold off those
securities in the secondary market, although their right to do so
under chapter 9 remains unclear. Standard & Poor's lowered its
rating of the county to CCC from AA-, and Moody's suspended ratings
on all noninsured Orange County bonds.
The reaction to these developments was widespread. Municipal
bond prices fell; dealers bid for uninsured Orange County debt at
deep discounts, although no trading has been reported, and its
insured debt traded for a while at a spread of 40 basis points over
other municipal securities, but such spreads have now dissipated.
Much of the debt issued by California municipalities is uninsured,

leaving mutual funds, households, and other holders to bear the
brunt of any losses stemming from defaults. But the county may
still decide to make its investors whole, and some recoveries may be
made through lawsuits against brokers who sold securities to Orange
County.
With the price of municipal securities down, the net asset
value of tax-exempt money market funds declined. Reports of unusual
outflows from these funds, however, have been limited to funds that
specialize in California paper. Several fund advisors have
requested SEC permission to shore up their funds' portfolios in
order to prevent them from "breaking the buck."
Earlier in the intermeeting period, the ratio of tax-exempt to
taxable yields had risen above 91 percent amid a large amount of
muni bond fund redemptions. Subsequently, large purchases by
insurance companies led to a rally in municipals, which pushed the
ratio below 90 percent. The Orange County developments reversed
that rally, sending the ratio back up to 91 percent. The ratio is
at its highest level in five years, apart from a few months in late
1993 when heavy volume boosted municipal bond rates (chart). In the
first week of December, tax-exempt bond funds experienced modest
inflows, but reports from a number of funds suggest that outflows
may have resumed more recently.
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt remained light in
November, owing to a continued low level of refunding activity.
Retirements probably roughly offset gross issuance last month,
leaving the stock of long-term tax-exempt debt about unchanged. The
level of such debt outstanding is estimated to have fallen about $5
billion since the beginning of the year. Heavy retirements
scheduled to occur in December ensure a further run-off of long-term
debt this month.

Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
Yield spreads for federally sponsored credit agencies widened
considerably over the intermeeting period. Some market participants
estimated that the bankruptcy filing by Orange County may have
caused spreads on short-term instruments to increase 10 to 15 basis
points, as dealers sold collateral backing Orange County's
repurchase agreements. But spreads had been widening for unrelated
reasons throughout November. The value of the stock of major
agencies fell; the stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in
particular, dropped more than 2 percent on December 7, the day after
the bankruptcy filing. These agencies, which grew rapidly in 1994,
may feel compelled to scale back the aggressive expansion of their
balance sheet if the spreads remain wide.
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance the
projected $79 billion fourth-quarter fiscal deficit partly by
borrowing $55 billion from the public and by drawing down its cash
balance by $9 billion. With no long-term bond in its midquarter
refunding, the Treasury has relied heavily on bills, which are
expected to raise $31 billion this quarter. Since September, the
Treasury has increased the size of the weekly bill auctions, from
$23 billion to $27 billion, while the sizes of the coupon auctions
have been kept unchanged. It also auctioned three cash management
bills, raising $35 billion, to help cover seasonal financial needs.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 grew at a 1 percent annual rate in November--the first
monthly increase since July. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to
November, M2 increased at that same rate, leaving it at the lower
bound of its growth cone.
The rise in M2 last month was mostly accounted for by rapid
increases in small time deposits and retail money funds, whose rates

kept pace with increases in market rates in recent months, at least
until the mid-November tightening. In addition, small time deposits
have probably been buoyed by banks' increased issuance of brokered
CDs, as indicated by Call Report data through September. Market
sources suggest that rates on brokered deposits have risen more than
those on nonbrokered CDs this year. Security dealers may be using
these instruments to lure customers moving out of mutual funds, and
banks can bid up rates on brokered CDs without raising the structure
of rates on their core retail deposit business.
In contrast, rates on OCDs and saving deposits have moved up
only slightly in recent months, considerably widening the
opportunity costs of such deposits. In consequence, these liquid
deposit components of M2 continued to contract in November.
A portion of the growth in M2 in November may mirror the net
redemptions of bond and stock mutual funds (chart). Outflows from
bond funds apparently accelerated in November, while inflows to
equity funds slowed early in the month and briefly turned to out-
flows around Thanksgiving. Investors may have channeled some of
these mutual funds outflows into direct holdings of securities,
consistent with heavy net noncompetitive tenders at Treasury
auctions of bills and notes again in November.
M3 grew at a 2 percent annual rate in November, a bit slower
than in October. The continued expansion of this aggregate has
positioned it well within its annual range. Growth in the non-M2
component of M3 slowed from its exceptional October pace, as
institution-only money market mutual funds, which had spurted in
October, were about flat for the month. Yields on these funds lag
market rates, inducing some investors to shift into direct holdings
of the underlying instruments after the mid-November tightening.

brisk pace, nevertheless proceeded at an annual rate exceeding 20
percent for the third consecutive month. The strength in large time
deposits over the last few months has contributed to the funding of
rapid loan growth in the face of weak retail deposits, compensating
for the weakness in other managed liabilities. To fund credit
growth over much of 1994, banks had been relying heavily on managed
liabilities; although credit growth continued, these liabilities
declined in both October and November.
Bank credit grew at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent in
November. Following the same pattern since August, robust loan
growth offset runoffs in security holdings. Consumer loans
decelerated to an annual rate of 7-1/2 percent from more than twice
that pace in October, partly because of increased securitization,
while the growth of real estate loans accelerated to 7-3/4 percent.
About half of the pickup in real estate loans was accounted for by
the purchase of a thrift by a large commercial bank and half by a
slowing of the run-off in real estate loans at branches and agencies
of foreign banks.
Growth in business loans remained robust, at a 9-1/2 percent
annual rate in November. In addition to a shift from longer-term
sources of funds owing to relatively high bond yields, this growth
may be due in part to a continued easing of terms and standards for
commercial and industrial loans, as reported by respondents to the
November senior loan officer opinion survey. Recently available
data on loan rates from the November survey of terms of bank
lending, conducted the week before the most recent tightening, show
a narrowing of spreads for small loans, while spreads remained
narrow for larger loans (chart).
In the last several senior loan officer surveys, banks have
attributed their easing of terms and standards to increased

competition. This relatively more aggressive lending behavior may
reflect the improved quality of bank balance sheets. The September
Call Report data show continued sharp declines in delinquency and
charge-off rates for all three major loan types (chart, page 16), as
well as a preservation of comfortable capital ratios. Indeed, this
relaxation of standards on business lending stands in contrast to
previous episodes of monetary tightening (chart, below).
Banks' holdings of securities declined at a 9-1/4 percent
annual rate in November after having fallen at a rate of 12 percent
in October. In both months, a significant part of the drop
reflected declines in the market value of securities that banks mark
to market. A little over half of securities at domestic banks are
marked to market--all of those held in trading accounts, plus those
held in investment accounts that are classified as available for
sale.

Business Finance
While lending by banks and commercial paper issuance was brisk
in November, public bond issuance by nonfinancial firms remained
fairly subdued. The $6-3/4 billion pace of bond issuance last month
was more than 50 percent below the average monthly rate in 1993,
when many firms satisfied their long-term funding needs by locking
in relatively low interest rates. The rise in bond rates has
depressed bond issuance this year and has reduced considerably the
average maturity of nonfinancial bond issues (chart).
Although yields on most corporate bonds, from investment grade
to junk, have remained close to those on Treasuries, spreads on junk
bonds of the lowest quality widened considerably in November.

Several planned issues of junk bonds have been withdrawn in recent
weeks, and the deals that were completed generally required higher
coupons than first anticipated or additional equity to attract
investors. The high-yield market remains particularly wary of
unseasoned and lower-quality issuers.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations
increased to $4-1/2 billion in November, up sharply from the anemic
pace that had prevailed since midsummer, and the issuance thus far
in December has slackened only slightly. Despite this pickup in
gross issuance, spurred by increases in both initial public
offerings and seasoned issues, net equity issuance is expected to be
negative again in the fourth quarter, reflecting another slug of
merger-related share retirements.
Merger activity has continued heavy in recent weeks. Since the
November FOMC meeting, eight mergers of nonfinancial firms have been
announced in which the target company was valued in the neighborhood
of $1 billion. Three of these transactions are structured as stock
swaps, and the other five involve equity retirements, which will be
debt financed to some degree. So far this year, $70 billion of
large nonfinancial mergers (those with targets valued at $1 billion
or more) have been completed, and deals valued at another $30
billion have been announced for later this year or early next year.
By comparison, only $22 billion of large nonfinancial mergers were
completed in 1993.
Issuance of commercial paper by nonfinancial companies has
continued to be robust on net, largely to provide funding for merger
activity. Nevertheless, strong corporate profits reportedly enabled
some firms to pay down outstanding paper--including paper that was
issued earlier to finance acquisitions. Further, cash from balance

sheet restructurings and asset sales reportedly was used to reduce
commercial paper outstanding.
Recently released reports on corporate earnings for the third
quarter have been strong on the whole and generally have come in
above analysts' forecasts. Nonetheless, over the intermeeting
period, broad indexes of stock prices moved down 3 to 6-1/2 percent,
as investors apparently were lured away from equities by the higher
rates on fixed-income instruments and by the potential for some
slowdown in the growth of corporate earnings. At the end of
November, the ratio of the Standard and Poor's 500 price index to
the earnings of companies in the index over the previous twelve
months stood at about 16-1/2, the lowest level during the current
expansion (chart).
Mortgage Markets
Contract rates on thirty-year fixed-rate conventional mortgages
climbed to their highest levels since late 1991 after the November
FOMC meeting but subsequently edged down and, on net, are little
changed from the November meeting. Initial rates on adjustable-rate
mortgages indexed to the one-year Treasury constant maturity yield
are up about 55 basis points, somewhat less than the one-year
Treasury benchmark and adding to the already large teaser discounts.
As a result, the FRM-ARM initial rate spread has narrowed to 260
basis points, around the levels prevailing in September 1993. The
ARM share of new conventional loan originations moved up to 49
percent in October, which was the highest ARM share since May 1989
(chart).
Upward adjustments to ARM rates this year are estimated to have
added less than $5 billion, on net, to annual household mortgage
interest costs, while interest rate adjustments on home equity lines
contributed about half as much to these costs. The increase in

these interest costs has been partly offset, however, by further
savings on FRMs in 1994, something over $3 billion, associated with
the large volume of refinancings earlier this year.
In the secondary mortgage market, gross issuance of pass-
throughs by the agencies slipped to about $20 billion in October,
and net issuance totaled $4.8 billion, near September's pace but
substantially below January's peak of $17 billion (chart). Spreads
of newly originated fixed-rate mortgage pass-through securities over
Treasuries have increased in recent weeks, owing to the flatter
yield curve and uncertainty surrounding the Orange County
developments.
Total mortgage debt outstanding grew at an estimated 5-1/4
percent annual rate in the third quarter, as all four property
categories registered positive growth. Residential mortgage debt
outstanding on single-family dwellings grew at an annual rate of
roughly 6-1/4 percent, while the comparable figure for multifamily
dwellings is 2-1/2 percent. Farm mortgage debt outstanding
increased at about a 4-1/2 percent annual rate, and outstanding debt
on nonfarm, nonresidential properties expanded at 1-1/4 percent, the
second consecutive quarter of growth after 3 years of decline.
Compared with previous cycles, growth in total mortgage debt in
the current expansion has been weak, owing both to the runoff in
debt outstanding on income properties and to the sluggish growth in
single-family mortgage debt outstanding. Historically, growth in
the latter debt category has tended to rise sharply after cyclical
troughs, reach a local peak around mid-cycle, and then decline,
usually bottoming out around the end of each economic downturn
(chart). In the most recent cycle, however, single-family mortgage
debt has failed to register the spurt in growth that has
characterized previous expansions, despite relatively strong housing

activity, and has consistently fallen short of model-based forecasts
(chart). Anecdotal reports of a pickup in the number of borrowers
making additional principal payments on their outstanding mortgages
may provide part of the explanation for the unusually slow growth of
home mortgage debt.
The Federal Housing Finance board announced last month that the
national average single-family house price was $141,900 for October
1994, down from $144,000 a year earlier. Normally, the percentage
change in the national average home purchase price as reported in
the FHFB's October interest rate survey is used by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac to determine the conforming loan limit; that is, the
maximum size of home loans that they will purchase or securitize.
But, despite the 1.5 percent drop in the home price index, both
agencies have announced that the current limit of $203.150 will be
retained. This would be only the second time since the statutory
formula was established in 1973 that the conforming loan limit
remained the same for three consecutive years; the first such
episode occurred in the 1975-1977 period, when the limit remained at
$42,000.
Consumer Installment Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit remained brisk in
October, at an annual rate of 16 percent, slightly above the third-
quarter average. Revolving credit registered an 18 percent annual
rate of increase, and the large "other" category also expanded
rapidly. After a very strong September, growth in auto credit
moderated to an annual rate of 11 percent.
Interest rates on consumer loans at banks rose between the
August and November surveys, as they have throughout 1994, but by
considerably less than yields on Treasury securities of similar

rates on unsecured personal loans rose 26 basis points to 13.59

basis points over the same period. The spread between rates on
newly originated new-car loans and yields on three-year Treasuries
has dropped from 400 basis points early last year to 130 basis
points most recently (chart). The narrowing spreads between
consumer and Treasury market rates reflect, in part, a typical lag
in consumer rates, which tend to track the more sluggish movements
in lenders' costs of funds but are also consistent with an easing of
banks' lending standards.

APPENDIX
GROWTH OF THE CREDIT AND MONETARY AGGREGATES IN 1994
Summary
Growth in M1 and M2 slowed in 1994 while growth in M3 and the
broad credit aggregates rose this year at least as rapidly as in
1993. Of particular note were changes in the composition of asset
flows which were greatly affected by the rise in interest rates this
year. Higher long-term interest rates induced borrowers to shift
into shorter-term or floating rate obligations; lenders, concerned
about future capital losses, seemed eager to reduce their exposure
to long-term market instruments thereby accommodating, and perhaps
even encouraging, the change in borrowers' preferences. A byproduct
of the rise in market interest rates and the deceleration of M1 was
a sharp weakening of reserve aggregates.
Total debt of nonfinancial sectors increased 5-1/4 percent
through November--the same as in 1993--leaving it in the lower half
of its monitoring range. A slower expansion of federal debt this
year offset a pickup in the debt growth of nonfederal sectors from 4
percent in 1993 to 5 percent in 1994.
Business borrowing was boosted by a rising financing gap and a
surge in merger and acquisition activity. However, the weakness in
bond and equity markets led firms to shift their credit demands
toward shorter-term debt such as commercial paper and bank loans.
Households, in turn, redirected mortgage borrowing into adjustable
rate loans, and mortgage debt continued to expand at a moderate pace
despite the backup in rates. Households also greatly increased
usage of consumer credit. The change in business and household
borrowing may have been encouraged by bank behavior: Survey
evidence indicated continued relaxation of standards and nonprice
terms of credit for business loans, and rates on consumer credit
lagged the rise in market rates. Bank credit overall grew at a 6-
1/2 percent pace through November, with bank loans advancing
7-1/4 over the same period.
Depositories elected to meet increased loan growth primarily
through sales of government securities and reliance on wholesale
funds. The shift toward wholesale funding in the form of large time
deposits helped push M3 growth up to 1-1/4 percent through November.
This was in the lower half of the Committee's range, and somewhat
faster than in 1993. Banks were reluctant to raise retail deposit
rates, however, and the resulting rise in the opportunity cost of
holding money constrained M2 growth to 1 percent this year--a bit
below the pace in 1993 and at the lower bound of its target range.
The sluggish expansion of M2 was quite consistent with long-run
historical relationships and, in contrast to 1992 and 1993, was not
a consequence of unusually large portfolio shifts into mutual funds.
Higher opportunity costs produced a sharp deceleration in M1 growth
from 10-1/2 percent in 1993 to 2-1/4 percent through November of
this year.
Domestic Nonfinancial Debt Growth
Although changes in the growth of the broad debt aggregates
were rather modest, rising long-term interest rates produced some
notable shifts in the underlying pattern of credit flows. Falling
bond prices and greater market uncertainty led households to scale
III-A-1

III-A-2
back their holdings of bond mutual funds in favor of investments
that posed less risk of capital loss. Outflows from bond mutual
funds began in February and continued at a rapid pace through
November. A portion of the outflow from bond funds likely helped
bolster inflows to money funds and bank retail certificates of
deposit in M2. In addition, short-term Treasury securities appeared
to be a popular safe haven for investors fleeing bond mutual funds.
Indeed, net noncompetitive tenders for Treasury bills averaged $1.2
billion per month through November, the highest level in more than a
decade.
Households made adjustments on the liability side of the
balance sheet as well. The pace of mortgage refinancing fell
sharply toward the end of 1993 and was further depressed by the
increase in long-term rates this year. Nonetheless, total household
mortgage debt continued to expand; ARMs became increasingly popular,
rising to nearly half of originations, with many mortgage lenders
offering attractive terms relative to those on fixed-rate mortgages.
Consumer credit accelerated as household spending on consumer
durables strengthened. In addition, convenience usage of credit
cards likely increased with the proliferation of cards offering
incentives tied to transaction volumes.
In the business sector, declines in bond and stock prices
sparked a change in funding patterns. Bond and equity issuance fell
off sharply during the year from the extremely heavy pace in 1993.
In the face of weak investor demand and higher interest rates, junk
bond offerings, in particular, were depressed. Stronger earnings
allowed many firms to finance a large portion of their capital
outlays with internal funds. In addition, many firms turned to
shorter-term instruments for their external financing needs.
Commercial paper grew rapidly in the second half of the year, while
bank loans to businesses increased for the first time since 1990, in
part reflecting a more accommodative stance by bank lenders. A
portion of the rise in commercial paper and business loans was
associated with a resurgence of merger activity during the year. In
addition, lending by finance companies accelerated sharply over the
year, paced by auto-related loans and equipment leasing.
In the state and local sector, tax-exempt bond issuance was
also depressed by the rise in interest rates. Much of the proceeds
of new tax-exempt bonds in recent years had been targeted to
refinance higher-cost debt issued in 1980s. Refunding offerings
subsided early this year, as the amount of bonds eligible for
advance refunding dwindled and borrowing costs rose. The moderate
pace of new offerings, coupled with an unusually large volume of
bond retirements, will result in a contraction in outstanding long-
term tax-exempt debt is projected to decline this year.
Depository Credit Growth
Bank credit expanded at a 6-1/2 percent pace from the fourth
quarter of 1993 through November--the fastest rate of growth since
1989. Indeed, through October, a little more than 30 percent of the
1. Individuals can purchase Treasury securities at auction by
submitting a noncompetitive tender through a Federal Reserve Bank at
no cost. In addition, they can buy Treasury securities through a
bank or brokerage firm for a modest fee. The data on noncompetitive
tenders thus measure only a portion of the total retail demand for
Treasury securities.

III-A-3
increase in total domestic nonfinancial debt was intermediated
through the banking sector--the largest share since the 1970s.
Business and consumer loans were the fastest growing components
of bank credit, with the increase in business loans especially
striking following the previous three years of runoffs. Responses
to survey questions throughout the year indicated that many banks
were easing underwriting standards and nonprice terms for such
loans. Moreover, data on bank loan pricing indicate that spreads of
bank loan rates over Treasuries held roughly constant over the year
despite the strength of loan demand, remaining well below levels
prevailing earlier in the 1990s. Continued declines in delinquency
and chargeoff rates for all major loan categories likely contributed
to banks' renewed interest in lending. Banks were also eager to
book consumer loans as suggested by historically low spreads of
rates on such loans over benchmark rates. Through November, growth
of consumer loans at banks strengthened to about 14-1/2 percent at
an annual rate--comparable to the growth of overall consumer credit
--even as securitization of consumer loans picked up.
The measured change in bank securities during the year was
significantly affected by two changes in accounting standards, which
on net added perhaps three-quarters of a percentage point to the
growth of bank credit. Aside from these accounting changes,
banks appeared to rely on liquidations of U.S. Treasury securities
to make room for new business and consumer loans, especially in the
second half of the year. Through November, growth of total bank
securities slowed to 5 percent compared with 8-1/2 percent last
year. Growth of Treasury securities was slightly negative through
November.
The long-running contraction of the S&L industry drew to a
close in the first quarter, tending to buoy growth of depository
credit.
M3 Growth
Helping to fund the pickup in depository credit, M3 expansion
picked up this year to 1-1/4 percent, comfortably within its 0 to 4
percent annual target range. With M2 deposits weak, domestic banks
issued large time deposits to fill a portion of their funding gap.
Growth of large time deposits for the year is expected in the
neighborhood of 6-1/4 percent, marking the first yearly increase in
this component since 1989. In an effort to avoid deposit insurance
premiums, much of the past year's large time deposit issuance took
the form of senior bank notes. Another substantial portion of
domestic banks' funding gap was filled by borrowing from (or
reducing lending to) their foreign offices--an item not included in
M3. The reasons for this trend are not clear, but may be related to
2. A new accounting rule implemented at the start of this year
(FIN 39) limited banks' ability to net their gross positions on
certain items that are included in "other securities." This rule
change, which inflated both sides of banks' balance sheets,
substantially boosted the growth of securities early in the year and
may have added as much as 1-1/4 percentage points to bank credit
growth for the year through November. A second accounting rule
change (FAS 115) required banks to begin marking-to-market
securities held in "available-for-sale" accounts. Estimates suggest
that revaluations of securities under FAS 115 pared perhaps 1/2
percentage point from the growth of bank credit during the year.

III-A-4
the profitability of investment opportunities at banks' domestic
offices relative to those overseas. In addition, borrowing from
foreign affiliates is not included in the deposit insurance
assessment base and, since December 1990, has not been subject to
reserve requirements.
M2 Growth
M2 hovered at or near the 1 percent lower bound of its target
range throughout the year, with banks not bidding very aggressively
for retail deposits. As noted, banks evidently found wholesale
funding less expensive than mounting a campaign to attract retail
deposits with attendant advertising, administrative, and deposit
insurance costs. On balance, though, M2 growth was more in line
with the historical relationships embodied in the staff's money
demand models than in recent years.
In part, weaker-than-expected adjustments of retail deposit
rates help explain why outflows from bond mutual funds and reduced
inflows into stock funds did not translate into faster M2 growth.
Indeed, with households evidently favoring direct holdings of
Treasury securities. M2 plus stock and bond funds grew at about the
same 1 percent pace as M2.
M1 Growth
Consistent with its historical behavior, Ml growth slowed
sharply in 1994 in response to widening opportunity costs. From the
fourth quarter of 1993 through November, MI grew only 2-1/4 percent
at an annual rate--down substantially from the double digit growth
recorded over the previous two years. Following the typical
pattern, demand deposits and other checkable deposits (OCDs) were
especially responsive to the rise in short-term interest rates. On
balance, demand deposits edged up only 1/2 percent through November
compared with growth of 13-1/4 percent in 1993. OCDs were depressed
early in the year by a reserve avoidance program introduced by
in which customers' OCD balances are swept into MMDA
accounts at the end of each day. In addition, a
holding company with affiliates operating in many of the same
markets implemented a version of the
sweep account program in September. further depressing OCD growth.
More important, the sluggish adjustment of interest rates offered on
OCD accounts throughout the year encouraged households to shift
funds into higher-yielding assets.
In contrast to transaction deposits, the currency component of
Ml continued to register strong growth. Through November, currency
advanced at a 10-1/2 percent pace, a bit faster than last year and
close to the record annual currency growth rate of 1990. As in 1990
and subsequent years, much of this year's currency growth was
associated with strong demands from abroad. In 1994, foreign demand
appeared to be heavily concentrated in Russia and the other former
Soviet republics.
The downturn in transaction deposits during the year led to a
decline in required reserves. Given the strength of currency
growth, however, the monetary base expanded at a 8-1/2 percent rate
through November, down only a little from the 10-1/2 percent pace
recorded last year.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was a bit larger
in September than in August (exports declined marginally and imports
increased slightly) and the deficit for the third quarter as a whole
was substantially greater than in the second quarter. Data for
October will be released by the Commerce Department on December 20.

Exports in September were slightly less than in August as rises
in exported aircraft, passenger cars shipped to overseas markets,
and service receipts from foreigners traveling in the United States
were more than offset by declines in most other categories of trade.
Nonetheless, third-quarter exports were 3 percent higher than in the
second quarter; the largest increases were in machinery, industrial
supplies, and consumer goods. Most of the rise was in quantity,
with the exception of industrial supplies (where virtually all of
the increase was in prices). By area, most of the increase in the
third quarter went to developing countries in Asia and Latin
America. Over the past year, exports to developing countries, and
to Canada and Japan, rose 15-20 percent on average, while exports to
countries in Western Europe rose an average of 6 percent.

Imports in September were marginally higher than in August. A
sharp drop in imported automotive products (from strong levels
reported in August) was offset by a large increase in imported
capital goods (aircraft, computers, and other machinery). Imported
consumer goods moved up slightly from the high levels reported in
August. The value of oil imports declined in September; a drop in
price was only partly offset by a moderate increase in the quantity
imported. The quantity of oil imports remained over 10 mb/d in
September (for the fourth consecutive month) as the pace of
inventory accumulation quickened.
For the third quarter, imports were 4.5 percent higher than in
the second quarter; the increases were spread among all major trade
categories and reflected the strength of consumption and investment
spending in the United States.
In October and November, preliminary Department of Energy
statistics indicate that higher oil consumption was met, in part, by
stock draws resulting in an easing of imported oil. Oil imports are
expected to be less in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.
Prices of Merchandise Imports and Exports
After rising since April, the price of imported oil fell $1.25
per barrel in September. Prices fell as world oil production
rebounded from low levels associated with effects of summer oilfield
maintenance and the strike in Nigeria. In October and November, the
price of imported oil appears to have remained near the September
average. In early November, spot oil prices (West Texas
Intermediate) fell as concerns over new shipping insurance
regulations (COFRs) abated. Prices have continued to ease downward
on balance in late November and early December. The twelve-month
extension of OPEC's quota has not put upward pressure on prices

because of rising concern over the potential effects of a warm
winter on needs for fuel at a time when there are ample product
inventories. Overall, the price of imported oil in the fourth
quarter should average about $0.85 per barrel less than in the third
quarter.
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports rose strongly in October, pushed
by a continued advance in the price of imported industrial supplies.
Also contributing to the rise was an upswing in the prices of
imported passenger vehicles (primarily associated with model
changeovers) and foods. In the third quarter, non-oil import prices
rose significantly more than in the second quarter, largely because
of prices of industrial supplies and foods.
Prices of exported nonagricultural products rose somewhat
faster in October than in recent months; in both October and the
third quarter increases were led by rising prices of industrial
supplies. Prices of U.S. agricultural exports fell slightly in
October; declines were recorded in four of the last five months.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States rose by more than
$10 billion in October. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) There were large increases in
holdings of several developing countries in Asia and Latin America.
In addition, holdings by Israel also rose substantially, probably
reflecting the proceeds of U.S. aid and bonds issued with U.S.
guarantees. Partial information from FRBNY indicates little
increase in G-10 reserves in November.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds were large
in October (line 4a). Entities in the Netherlands Antilles
accounted for most of the total. Net purchases of U.S. corporate

and government agency bonds (line 4b) were also significant, but
foreigners continued to sell U.S. corporate stocks (line 4c).
U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds (lines 5a and
5b) rebounded strongly in October. Bond purchases were almost
entirely from Europe and Canada. More than half of stock purchases
were also from developed countries. However, there were also net
purchases of stocks from Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, and South
Korea.
For the first ten months of 1994, U.S. net purchases of foreign
bonds were down sharply from the 1993 pace. In fact, U.S. residents
were net sellers of bonds in Europe. Bond purchases in Latin
America (excluding the Caribbean financial centers) were up in 1994,
but only because of more than $5 billion in Brazilian bonds acquired
as part of that country's bank debt rescheduling. Rising interest
rates on bonds denominated in dollars and many other major
currencies produced capital loses for holders of long-term bonds and
outflows from U.S. international bond funds.
U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks in the first ten months of
1994 have come closer than bonds to maintaining the record 1993
pace. Net purchases of stocks in Japan were very large,
particularly in the first quarter, and accounted for one-third of
U.S. net purchases in the first 10 months of 1994. Net purchases in
the rest of the world were down from the 1993 pace. In particular,
the developing countries that received the largest net equity
inflows from the United States in 1993 (Hong Kong, Mexico,
Argentina, Brazil, and Singapore) have all received smaller inflows
in 1994. U.S. investor interest has picked up, though, in a wide
assortment of other developing countries, including South Korea,
Chile, Indonesia, China, India, and Peru.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the November 15 FOMC meeting, the weighted average value
of the dollar, shown in the chart, has risen 2 percent. The dollar
rose by similar amounts against the mark and the yen. The larger
than expected increase in U.S. short-term rates on November 15
reassured the market of the Federal Reserve's determination to
contain inflation and contributed to the dollar's rise early in the
period. The dollar continued strengthening for most of the period,
buoyed in large part by strong U.S. labor market data and the rising
expectation that the Federal Reserve would tighten again before the
end of the year. The dollar rose only 1-1/2 percent on balance
against British sterling; tightening by the Bank of England helped
stem the decline of the U.K. currency.
Three-month interest rates rose about 20 to 40 basis points in
most foreign G-10 countries during the intermeeting period, but rose
about 170 basis points in Canada, 70 basis points in Italy, and 50
basis points in France. Three-month rates remained about unchanged
in Japan.
The large rise in Canadian short-term rates is mainly a
response to concerns about large and stubborn fiscal deficits of the
provincial and central governments, which weighed on the Canadian
dollar over the period. The rise in three-month rates to a lesser
extent reflects the Bank of Canada's 50 basis point tightening of
overnight rates during the period and anticipated further tightening
in response to strong growth of economic activity.
U.K. short-term rates rose 20 basis points during the period
after the Bank of England raised its minimum lending rate by 50
basis points on December 7. Most market participants had not
expected a rate rise of this magnitude until early next year.

In Italy, short-term increases in interest rates reflected
ongoing turmoil within the Berlusconi government. In France, short-
term rates moved higher after Jacques Delors announced that he does
not intend to run for President. Delors was viewed as a strong
proponent of EMU, and his withdrawal from the race is viewed as
increasing the chances that EMU could emerge as an issue in the
Presidential election, or that the next President of France may not
be as staunch a supporter of EMU.
Weighted average foreign long-term interest rates were little
changed on balance during the intermeeting period. Long-term rates
rose about 10 basis points in Germany and Canada and declined by
about the same amounts in the United Kingdom and Japan.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
In the third quarter, growth of real GDP appears to have
exceeded potential output growth in all of the major foreign
industrial countries for the first time in the current recovery.
Growth in Japan and Germany accelerated in the third quarter on the
strength of private consumption and investment. In France, the

IV-13
United Kingdom, and Canada, growth slowed in the third quarter but
remained at least 3 percent. The slowdowns in France and the United
Kingdom were largely accounted for by declines in the contribution
of net exports. In contrast, deceleration in Canada was more than
accounted for by a decline in domestic demand, particularly in
investment. Italian industrial production grew robustly in the
third quarter but somewhat slower than in the second quarter.
(Third-quarter GDP data are not yet available for Italy.) In the
fourth quarter, the pace of activity in the major foreign industrial
countries generally appears to have slowed somewhat and may have
fallen in Italy due to recent strikes and a major flood.
Consumer-price inflation remains subdued in most major foreign
industrial countries. Unemployment rates have stabilized or begun
to fall, although they generally remain well above estimates of
structural unemployment rates.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GDP increased 3.7
percent (SAAR) in the third quarter, after increasing a revised 0.7
percent in the second quarter. The third-quarter increase was
driven by a strong recovery in private consumption and the first
positive growth in private plant and equipment investment since the
third quarter of 1991. The latest rise in GDP was the third
consecutive quarterly increase, pointing to a firming of the
economic recovery.

Data for the fourth quarter are mixed, but on balance suggest a
continuation of growth, albeit at a slower pace. In October,
industrial production edged down somewhat, while housing starts
rebounded. There was a large decline in new car registrations. The
recent stability in the unemployment rate and in the job
offers/applicants ratio suggest that the labor market has hit
bottom.

In the Bank of Japan's November economic survey (Tankan), the
index of business sentiment of major manufacturing firms registered
-29, up from -39 in the previous survey taken in August, the third
consecutive increase after more than four years of decline.
However, firms predicted a roughly 4 percent decline in investment
in the fiscal year that began in April, about the same predicted
decline as in August's survey.
Economic recovery is continuing at a brisk pace in western
Germany. Real GDP rose 5.3 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter
following a 4 percent gain in the second quarter. Since the
recession trough in the first quarter of last year, real GDP has
risen 4 percent and is now almost 1 percent above its previous peak.

IV-15
The largest increase in third quarter spending was in
consumption, which rose 6.1 percent, more than reversing the second-
quarter decline. Investment spending was up moderately, due to a
substantial gain in equipment purchases. Construction expenditures,
which surged during the mild winter, were unchanged in the third
quarter after falling a little in the second quarter. Net exports
dropped somewhat.

Recent data suggest that economic growth is continuing at a
robust pace in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators
are positive as well. Industrial production in October was about
1-1/2 percent above the third-quarter level, while orders for
manufactured goods surged in September and remained at a high level
in October. Most of the recent strength in orders was due to
foreign demand, suggesting renewed strength in exports in the coming
months. Other business indicators, including manufacturers'
production plans and firms' assessment of their inventory situation,
also showed an improvement in October. However, retail sales
dropped sharply in October and were about 2 percent lower than the
third-quarter average.
The recovery has still had only a minor impact on the labor
market, as the unemployment rate edged down to 9.1 percent in

IV-16
November Meanwhile, inflation continues to decelerate. In
November, 12-month consumer price inflation for western Germany was
2.7 percent, the lowest rate since early 1991. Wage growth
continues to be relatively moderate, with earnings per hour up only
about 1-1/2 percent in the year ending in September.

Production in eastern Germany has continued to expand at a
rapid rate, with industrial production in September up 14 percent
from its year-earlier level. Orders for manufactured goods were 16
percent above their previous-year level in September. The
unemployment rate fell in November to 13 percent, 2 percentage
points below its year-earlier level.
In France, real GDP growth slowed to 3 percent (SAAR) in the
third quarter from 4.6 percent in the second. The slowdown occurred
because the contribution from net exports turned negative as imports
continued to grow at a relatively rapid pace and exports were almost
flat. Also contributing was a modest slowing in consumption growth.
Inventories made a significant positive contribution to growth.
Monthly indicators suggest that, on balance, growth may slow
further in the fourth quarter. Consumption of manufactured products
(one-third of total consumption) fell very sharply in October, while
retail sales (SA) were flat. Preliminary data for large stores

Consumer price inflation edged up in November to 1.6 percent
at a 12-month rate. However, underlying inflation, which excludes a
large increase in fruit and vegetable prices, declined slightly to
1.5 percent. This good inflation performance has been supported by
a slight slowing of wage inflation to 2.3 percent in the third
quarter.

In the United Kingdom, the pace of activity slowed in the
third quarter from very rapid increases in the second quarter, due
primarily to a decline in the contribution of net exports. In
addition, domestic demand growth decelerated for the third
consecutive quarter as inventory accumulation slowed.

In the fourth quarter, growth may slow somewhat further, but it
appears to have remained robust. Although essentially flat in
October, industrial production and retail sales were 0.9 percent and
0.3 percent above their third-quarter averages, respectively.
Producer and consumer confidence edged back slightly in October and
November from their strong showing in the third quarter. In
November, the unemployment rate fell to 8.8 percent, and job
vacancies increased to their highest level in over four years.
Underlying wage inflation in October picked up to 4 percent (SAAR)
from 3.75 percent recorded most of this year, and underlying
inflation increased to 2.3 percent in November on the strength of
food price increases.
On November 29, the government released its budget, in which

On December 7, the government increased the minimum lending
rate 50 basis points to 6-1/4 percent. The rate was last changed on
September 12 when it was also raised 50 basis points. According to
Chancellor Clarke, the increase was taken "in order to sustain
economic recovery with low inflation" and followed the surprising
defeat of a government budget measure in Parliament the previous
night. (The measure would have increased the VAT on home fuel to
17.5 percent from 8 percent.)
Indicators in Italy suggest that the recovery continued to
move ahead in the third quarter. Although capacity utilization
edged down slightly, industrial production expanded briskly, the
unemployment rate fell sharply as employment rose, and business
sentiment firmed further. However, activity in the fourth quarter
looks weaker. Consumer confidence dipped in October and November
due to uncertainty over pension reform, and a forecast released by
ISCO, a respected research institute, calls for a 2.4 percent (SAAR)
decline in GDP in the fourth quarter after a projected 3.6 percent
increase in the third quarter because of widespread strikes by labor
unions and last month's devastating flood.

On December 1, the Berlusconi government signed an agreement
with the labor unions that will postpone most elements of pension
reform until June 1995 when legislation will be drafted. In return,
the unions agreed to call off a general strike planned for December
2 and to continue to abide by the July 1993 labor agreement that
limits wage growth to the government's projected inflation rate.
In Canada, real GDP continued to expand at a vigorous pace in
the third quarter. Most of the strength came from merchandise
exports; final domestic demand increased only 1.1 percent (SAAR),
its slowest advance in a year and a half. After surging in the
second quarter, fixed investment fell as a drop in residential
construction offset moderate increases in machinery and equipment
investment and nonresidential construction.
Early indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that economic
activity is continuing at a robust pace. Full-time employment in
both goods-producing and service industries grew strongly in
November. Slack still remains in labor markets, however, and

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity appears strong in major developing countries
and economies in transition with the exceptions of Venezuela and
Russia. Inflation performance has been mixed.
In Mexico, real GDP has grown strongly in recent quarters while
inflation has remained restrained: newly inaugurated President
Ernesto Zedillo has chosen a cabinet that promises continued free-
market policies. In Brazil, growth has picked up while inflation
remains low following the stabilization of the exchange rate last
July; President-elect Henrique Cardoso's prospective choices for
Central Bank head and Economy Minister have been closely associated
with the disinflation program. Argentina and Taiwan continue to
combine steady growth with low inflation. In Korea, very robust
economic activity has taken place alongside stable inflation, but in
China, rapid growth has fueled strong inflationary pressures. Both
Russia and Venezuela have experienced contractions of economic
activity combined with rising inflation. However, there are signs
that Russian output may be stabilizing.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, real GDP was 2.9 percent
above its year-earlier level in the January-September period, with
year-over-year growth in the third quarter alone coming in at 4.5
percent. Industrial production has been particularly buoyant,
registering 6.1 percent above its year-earlier level in September.
While these high rates of growth in part reflect the depressed level
of the economy in the third quarter of 1993, they also signal that
the economic recovery is becoming firmly established. Increases in
public spending are believed to be contributing to the recovery, but
Mexico's general government budget continued to show a small surplus
for the January-September period, although it was much reduced from
its year-earlier level.

IV-26
Notwithstanding the stronger pace of activity, consumer price
inflation has remained quiescent. It registered 6.9 percent on a
year-over-year basis in November, slightly above the third quarter's
6.7 percent rate, but equal to the rate averaged in the January-
October period. However, the trade deficit has grown to $13.7
billion in the January-September period, up from $10.4 billion in
the same period last year.
President Ernesto Zedillo, inaugurated on December 1, chose
former Commerce Department head Jaime Serra Puche as Secretary of
Finance. While previous Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe, a key figure
in Mexico's stabilization program, was not included in Zedillo's
cabinet, it is expected that the new economic team will continue the
free-market policies of the Salinas Administration. In the 1995
budget proposal sent to Congress on December 9, President Zedillo
affirmed the goals of higher growth, lower inflation, and a balanced
budget that were contained in the annual social pact signed by the
Salinas Administration last September.
In spite of this continuity in economic policymaking, financial
markets have remained unsettled due to continued political
uncertainty, increased foreign interest rates, and the growing trade
deficit. The peso/dollar exchange rate has remained within one
percent of the "lower" limit of its fluctuation band. The spread
between the rate on three-month peso-denominated Treasury bills and
comparable Eurodollar rates registered 858 basis points at the
December 14 auction compared with a recent low of 791 basis points
at the September 28 auction. The Mexico City stock market is well
below its September peak.
In Brazil, growth has been robust while inflation appears to be
relatively low. Real GDP in the third quarter was up 6 percent over
the third quarter of 1993, compared with growth of 4 percent in

IV-27
1993. Anecdotal accounts suggest that the credit controls imposed
in late October have dampened demand for durable goods, while growth
in sales of non-durable goods remains strong. Analysts expect that
consumer prices in December will rise by 2.5 percent, compared with
an increase of 3 percent in November. Monthly inflation is far
below the nearly 50 percent level reached before the new currency,
the real, was adopted last July.
The trade surplus was $11.9 billion in the January-October
period, up from a surplus of $11.4 billion over the same period in
1993, reflecting import growth of 17 percent and export growth of 13
percent. The real/dollar exchange rate has remained stable at about
0.85 since September. Under Brazil's current anti-inflation plan,
the central bank is committed to maintaining the value of the
currency at no lower than one real per dollar.
It is widely expected that Central Bank President Pedro Malan
will be President-elect Henrique Cardoso's Economy Minister, and
Persio Arida, currently head of Brazil's main development bank, will
be the new central bank president Cardoso, who has not confirmed
the appointments, takes office January 1. Malan and Arida have been
closely associated with Brazil's anti-inflation plan, and their
appointments have been regarded as a reaffirmation of Cardoso's
commitment to economic reform.
In Argentina, growth is steady while inflation remains low.
Industrial production during the first nine months of 1994 was up
5.1 percent from a year earlier. Consumer prices were 3.7 percent
higher in November than a year earlier. The cumulative trade
deficit for the year through October widened to $4.9 billion
compared with its year-earlier level of $2.4 billion. However, in
the third quarter, year-over-year export growth registered 22.1

IV-28
percent, exceeding import growth of 20.7 percent for the first time
since the start of the Convertibility Plan in April 1991.
After ceasing auctions in October because it considered the
interest rates that were bid to be too high, Argentina resumed its
local auctions of 91- and 182-day Treasury bills, which are offered
both on a peso- and dollar-denominated basis, on November 22. For
91-day bills, the only offering for which data are available, the
government accepted bids for 200 million pesos and $200 million at
rates of 9.5 percent and 7.58 percent respectively. These rates
represent an increase from the last tender on September 26, when
peso-denominated bills were auctioned at 7.5 percent and dollar-
denominated bills at 6.2 percent. The increase in the spread
reflects growing fears that Argentina's budget may have moved into
deficit, raising concerns about the sustainability of the
Convertibility Plan.
In Venezuela, the highly expansionary monetary policy
implemented by the central bank in recent months has not stopped the
decline in economic activity. Consumer price inflation was 4.3
percent in November, down from 5 percent in October but up from
monthly rates of about 3 percent last year, despite the imposition
of price controls in late June.
The cumulative trade deficit for the year through October was
$3.3 billion, down from the deficit of $6.8 billion recorded over
the same period in 1993, reflecting a 32 percent decline in imports
and a 16 percent increase in exports. The fall in imports reflects
continued weak aggregate demand and strict foreign exchange controls
imposed in June 1994. The central bank's official reserves,
excluding gold, stood at an estimated $8 billion at the end of
October.

IV-29
In China, economic activity and inflationary pressures continue
to be strong. Industrial value added rose 24 percent above its
year-earlier level in both October and November. Consumer prices in
October were 28 percent above their year-earlier level; for the
three months ending in October, consumer prices rose at an annual
rate of 42 percent.
In the first ten months of 1994, China ran a trade surplus of
$2.4 billion, reflecting export growth of 30 percent and import
growth of 15 percent over the year-earlier period. In the first ten
months of 1994, foreign direct investment was $25 billion. Some
financial market participants appear to be reassessing the
creditworthiness of Chinese companies, however, in the wake of a
recent lawsuit filed by Lehman Brothers against two Chinese
companies for nonpayment of debts, as well as other reports of
nonpayment by Chinese firms.
In Taiwan, growth continues to be relatively steady, while
inflation has been moderate. Real GDP rose 6.1 percent in the third
quarter of 1994 from a year earlier, after rising 6.4 percent in the
second quarter. Industrial production in October was 9.4 percent
higher than a year earlier. Consumer prices in November were 3.9
percent higher than a year earlier. The trade surplus for the
January-November period was $7 billion, down slightly from its year-
earlier level, reflecting a 9 percent growth in exports and 11
percent growth in imports
Real GDP in Korea increased by 7.7 in the third quarter from
the same period a year earlier. Fixed investment continued to
expand rapidly, increasing by 11.2 percent during the third quarter.
Despite strong growth in economic activity, inflation has remained
stable at roughly a 6 percent annual rate since the beginning of

IV-30
this year. Consumer prices rose by 6.1 percent in November from a
year earlier.
Merchandise exports increased by 13 percent in the first 10
months of 1994, in part because a substantial real depreciation of
the Korean won against the yen has enhanced Korean competitiveness.
However, imports rose 19 percent over the same period. This
contributed to a widening of the current account deficit for the
first ten months of this year to $4.6 billion, from $170 million
during the same period a year earlier.
Russian inflation has surged in recent months. Consumer
prices, after rising only 5 percent during August 1994--a 30-month
low--increased 15 percent in October and 14 percent in November.
The government has attributed the jump in inflation to seasonal
increases in food prices and to rising import prices triggered by
the ruble's sharp depreciation during September and October. It
seems unlikely that inflation will fall to 7 percent in December,
the target specified in Russia's IMF Systemic Transformation
Facility.
The ruble was relatively stable during November and early
December, depreciating against the dollar at a steady rate of about
1-1/2 percent a week. On December 14, the MICEX ruble-dollar
exchange rate closed at 3368.
According to Russian official statistics, real GDP during the
first ten months of 1994 contracted by 15 percent, compared with the
same period last year, and industrial production was 22 percent
below its year-earlier level. During the fourth quarter, however,
economic activity may have begun to stabilize. In October, for
example, real GDP grew by 4 percent (year/year). The government
recently estimated that the "shadow" economy, which is not included

IV-31
in official statistics, accounts for at least 20 percent of economic
activity and is still growing.
Discussions between the Russian government and the IMF on a
stand-by arrangement reportedly are making progress, but the Fund
has rejected the government's proposed 1995 budget. The IMF
estimates that the budget, as written, would generate a deficit
equal to 10 percent of GDP, and has urged the government to take
steps to increase budget revenues by 3-4 percent of GDP.
