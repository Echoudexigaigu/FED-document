DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Signs that growth of economic activity is moderating have been
multiplying in recent weeks, with indications of weakening demand in
several sectors. However, rates of resource utilization remain
high: After jumping in January, the unemployment rate fell back to
5.4 percent last month, and capacity utilization in manufacturing
remained around 85 percent. Producer and consumer price indexes
have risen more rapidly, on average, in the past two months than
they did in 1994, but no acceleration of wages is evident at this
point.
Labor Market Developments
The demand for labor still appears to be quite robust. Average
monthly growth of private payrolls has slowed only a little in
recent months, and although the average workweek of production or
nonsupervisory workers no longer appears to be lengthening, the
aggregate hours of these workers has continued to move up at an
appreciable pace. On average, the level of aggregate hours in
January and February was 0.7 percent above the fourth-quarter level.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased 318,000 in February after
a rise of 176,000 in January. The average gain of about 250,000
over the two months is only a little below the sizable increases
recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. In the service-
producing sector, jobs in business services were up an average of
50,000 a month in January and February, as personnel supply services
and computer services scored strong gains; employment in health
services rose 23,000 per month, on average. The average monthly
gain in retail and wholesale trade employment was about 75,000.
In the goods-producing sector, manufacturing payrolls rose an
average 36,000 per month in January and February. The largest gains

occurred among manufacturers of fabricated metals, industrial
machinery, electrical machinery, transportation equipment, food
products, and rubber and plastics. The factory workweek remained
roughly constant in the very high range that has prevailed over the
past year. In construction, employment fell 32,000 in February
after increasing 41,000 the previous month; these gyrations
evidently reflected the unseasonably mild weather in January and the
return of more normal conditions in February.
Various other data to which we look for indications of the
strength of labor demand have continued to be relatively upbeat in
recent months. Since the week of the latest employment surveys in
mid-February, initial claims for unemployment insurance have
remained in the low range observed over the past year. The most
recent Employment Outlook Survey conducted by Manpower, Inc., showed
its measure of net hiring strength for the second quarter to be the
strongest reading in several years. The Conference Board Survey of
consumers indicates that respondents have found job opportunities to
be increasingly plentiful this year; however, expectations of future
labor market conditions have softened a little.
Employment indicators in the household survey have fluctuated a
good deal in recent months. Most notably, the unemployment rate
declined to 5.4 percent in December, rose to 5.7 percent in January,
and then dropped back to 5.4 percent again in February. These ups
and downs may have reflected, at least in part, difficulties with
seasonal adjustment of data from the new household survey, which
has been in place only fourteen months. The average unemployment
rate for January and February was the same as the average for the
fourth quarter and about 1 percentage point below the rates recorded
in the same two months of 1994. The latest Bureau of National
Affairs quarterly employment survey also indicates that labor

markets have been tightening: Most notably, an increasing
percentage of firms have been reporting that production and service
jobs are difficult to fill.
Data through the end of 1994 indicate continued appreciable
gains in labor productivity. Output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector rose at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter of 1994 and increased 1.4 percent over the four quarters of
the year, a gain that was close to our estimate of the underlying
trend rate. In manufacturing, productivity continued to soar last
year, and the desire for additional gains in efficiency reportedly
is an important driving force behind the strong investment plans for
1995.

Industrial Production
The total index of industrial production rose 0.5 percent in

closer to normal last month. Manufacturing output expanded
0.4 percent after a revised 0.2 percent gain in January; the average
gain for the two months was substantially below the rapid pace seen
toward the end of 1994. The factory operating rate remained flat at
85.1 percent in February; over the past few months, it has been
hovering around the peak reached during the business expansion of
the 1980s.

Growth in output of motor vehicles and parts moderated last
month. Assemblies of vehicles moved up just a touch, to an annual
rate of 13.0 million units. Industry schedules for March show
production holding at the February level, with available weekly
output figures running close to schedules. A sizable reduction in
assemblies currently is scheduled for the second quarter, owing to
inventory problems and retooling.

Throughout 1994, market groups such as consumer durables and
construction supplies, which typically exhibit strong cyclical
patterns, continued to rise quite rapidly, seemingly little affected
by the consequences of last year's rise in interest rates. However,
production gains for these items slowed appreciably in February.
Output of consumer durable goods was up 0.1 percent last month, as a
small gain in consumer automotive parts, coming mainly from light
trucks and replacement parts, was nearly offset by a decline in
output of other durable goods such as household appliances and
furniture. Output of construction supplies also was up just
0.1 percent in February, after a rise of 0.6 percent in January and
even stronger increases, on average, during 1994. With housing
starts down sharply in the past couple of months and motor vehicle
assemblies scheduled to drop back in the second quarter, renewed

strength in consumer durables and construction supplies does not
seem likely in the near term.
Although utilization rates have generally drifted sideways in
the past two months, they remain at high levels. In primary
processing industries (mainly the producers of intermediate goods)
average operating rates have come down a bit since December but
remain around the highest levels since 1973; the absence of slack in
these industries continues to be a source of significant upward
pressure in the prices of materials.
The estimates of capacity utilization for January and February
of this year incorporate a further step-up in the estimated rate of
growth in manufacturing capacity. After increasing at a relatively
sluggish rate of about 2 percent over the four years ended in 1991,
growth of capacity began picking up in 1992 as investment started to
climb; last year's rise in capacity is estimated to have been about
3 percent. We have estimated that the increase this year could be
more than 4 percent, given the continued strength in most of the
recent indicators of near-term investment spending and the bullish
investment plans that manufacturers seem to have made for the year
as a whole.1
Motor Vehicles
Based on seasonal factors prepared by the Board staff, the unit
sales of light vehicles declined 5 percent in February, after
holding in January. Purchases of both autos and trucks fell last
month; the drop was especially large for sales of domestic autos.
1. The Census Bureau's Investment Plans Survey, introduced just
this year, indicates that manufacturers are planning to spend
20 percent more on new capital than they did in 1994. Although a
longer track record of survey results will be needed before the
usefulness of the IPS can be assessed, the initial survey results
for manufacturing seem to reinforce other indicators that point to
strength in investment in that sector.

Confidential data from General Motors and Ford suggest that
the falloff in sales in February came mainly from weakness in the
consumer sector. Consumer purchases of autos manufactured by those
two companies (including leased vehicles) fell more than 10 percent
in February, while fleet sales were down about 2 percent (chart).
Moreover, both the Michigan and Conference Board surveys indicate
that auto buying intentions continued to weaken early this year,
with higher prices and interest rates cited in the Michigan survey
as the main reasons. Regarding truck sales, purchases of sport
utility vehicles eased a bit last month; according to anecdotal
reports, supply limitations, which had constrained sales last year,
were not a major factor in February. Sales of pickups and vans
declined a bit as well; minivan sales, while up last month, were
still at a relatively low level.
The pace of motor vehicle sales so far this quarter is about
2 percent below the strong fourth-quarter average and well below
auto producers' expectations. As a result, dealer stocks have
increased. In February, the days' supply of domestic autos rose
sharply to an uncomfortably high 74 days; the days' supply of light
trucks also moved up somewhat. In response, vehicle manufacturers
have recently introduced or extended sales incentives for many
models, in addition to scheduling a lower level of assemblies
through the spring. Among the Big Three, most of the incentive
programs currently are scheduled to end between March 31 and April
30.
Personal Income and Consumption
Growth in consumer spending has slowed somewhat in recent
months following robust gains in the second half of last year.
According to staff estimates that incorporate revised retail sales
data, total real personal consumption expenditures rose 0.1 percent

in December and about 1/4 percent in January.2 Available data
for February point to soft motor vehicle sales and, as indicated in
the advance report on retail sales, a marked decline in spending on
3other goods. Nominal sales in the retail control category--
which excludes automotive dealers and building materials and supply
stores--fell 0.5 percent last month, according to the advance
report. Sales declined at furniture and appliance stores, apparel
outlets, general merchandisers, and food stores. Real outlays for
services rose 0.2 percent in January after a gain of only
0.1 percent in December. The January increase in part reflected
higher spending on electricity and natural gas, as temperatures were
not quite as unseasonably warm as they had been in December.
Outlays for non-energy services rose just 0.1 percent in January,
compared with an average monthly increase of 0.2 percent over the
past year.
Personal income continued to grow at a robust pace in January,
largely because of the big increases in aggregate hours and average
hourly earnings that month; the level of real disposable income in
January was up 4.6 percent, at an annual rate, from its fourth-
2. Officially, real PCE in January still is reported as having
been unchanged from the level of December. However, nominal sales
of stores in the retail control category now are estimated to have
risen 1 percent in January, up from an initial estimate of
0.5 percent.
3. In contrast to Federal Reserve data, which show vehicle sales
edging up in January and then falling sharply in February, BEA data
show sales dropping appreciably in January and decreasing a bit
further last month. Seasonal factors that the Federal Reserve now
is employing adjust for reporting changes that automakers adopted
early this year; the BEA's seasonal factors do not incorporate an
adjustment for these changes.
The difficulty in allocating sales between months should have
little effect on BEA's estimate of the contribution of the motor
vehicle sector to GDP in the first quarter. Because BEA estimates
the change in inventories of new domestic motor vehicles from the
difference between production and sales, mismeasurement in sales
is accompanied by offsetting mismeasurement in inventory investment.

4quarter average. Looking to February, the data on hours worked
and average hourly earnings point to some weakness in gains in wages
and salaries, but a boost is expected from the $1.7 billion of
bonuses (not at an annual rate) paid to auto workers in February.
These payouts are more than double the size of last year's auto
bonuses.
Some of the recent softness in spending may be attributable to
delays in the disbursement of tax refunds. As discussed in more
detail in a later section, the IRS has indicated that a
disproportionate number of processing delays occurred on returns
claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit: households receiving the
credit are more likely to use refunds to finance consumption than
are higher-income households. Any effect of late refunds on PCE
should be offset by higher spending when the refund checks start
rolling out this spring. If BEA follows their usual procedure in
calculating disposable income, they will allocate refunds smoothly
over the entire year; thus, the change in the timing of refunds will
not show up in the published monthly pattern of disposable income.
Consumer sentiment has moved down of late in both the Michigan
and Conference Board surveys. A noticeable decline in the
preliminary reading of the Michigan index in March reflected less
optimistic assessments of current and prospective personal financial
situations and of expected business conditions over the next twelve
months and five years. A drop in the Conference Board measure in
February reflected moderate declines in households' expectations of
4. Each January, disposable income growth is affected by
adjustments to social security, other federal programs, pay raises
for federal employees, and indexing of income tax brackets.
Although these factors exert a regular influence on income growth
each year, the BEA does not seasonally adjust them. This year,
income growth in January also was affected by changes made in OBRA93
that boosted Earned Income Tax credits and tax rates on upper income
brackets. The effects of the regular and OBRA93-related adjustments
on real DPI growth this January were largely offsetting.

business conditions and employment opportunities six months from
now. Despite the recent slippage, households' views of the economy
still appear to be relatively optimistic. The February drop in the
Conference Board measure was relatively small, and the declines in
the Michigan index in February and early March offset a pickup that
had occurred in December and January. The readings for all these
months were in a high and relatively narrow range compared with
readings that were observed in the first two or three years of the
expansion.
Housing Markets
Most key indicators of housing activity have weakened
noticeably in recent months and are at, or near, their lowest levels
in at least a year. Single-family housing starts edged down in
February after falling 15 percent in January: the pace of these
starts is at the lowest level in nearly two years. The slowdown
probably reflects a lagged response to the higher mortgage rates of
the past couple of quarters.
Home sales have been trending down over the past year but with
erratic monthly movements and, at times, unusually large revisions.
The current figures show that after rallying for a time last autumn,
new home sales slumped toward year-end and recovered only part of
those losses in January of this year. Although the homebuilding
industry has been voicing concern about inventories, the months'
supply of unsold new homes at the end of January was only slightly
above its long-run average. Sales of existing homes declined 5
percent in January; this decline, together with downward revisions
to earlier months, put this series on an unmistakable downtrend.
Sales prices of both existing and new homes have been flat in their
most recent readings, although the higher rates of rise reported in

constant-quality price indexes suggest that mix shifts might be
holding down the recent average monthly transaction prices.
Other indicators of single-family activity generally weakened
in February and early March. Consumer homebuying attitudes in the
Michigan survey continued to decline, reaching their lowest level in
four years, and builders' negative assessments of their sales
returned to their downtrend in March after an uptick in February.
However, applications for home purchase loans at mortgage bankers
moved up in the most recent weekly reading, to the top end of the
range of the past two months.
Multifamily housing construction fell back in February from the
pace of 300,000 units recorded in January, but trends in permits
hint at a rebound in March. Although these starts have about
doubled from their thirty-five-year low reached in early 1993, they
are still less than half the levels of the mid-1980s. Tightening in
some local markets continues to be tempered by high vacancies and
soft rents elsewhere.
Business Fixed Investment
Taken at face value, the investment indicators of recent months
suggest that growth in business outlays for fixed capital might have
slowed quite sharply from the robust pace of last year. However,
much of the apparent slowdown is in the indicators of office and
computing equipment and runs counter to all the industry anecdotal
reports of ongoing strength. Elsewhere, business outlays for light
vehicles have weakened, but investment in most other types of
equipment is still surging ahead. Construction activity--outside of
the public utility sector--was strong in January, and anecdotal
reports continue to be consistent with a healthy uptrend in
investment of nonresidential structures. The fundamental
determinants of investment spending remain relatively favorable:

The cost of capital is being held down by declines in computer
prices and, recently, by increases in stock and bond prices. In
addition, the acceleration of business output continued to be a
slightly positive influence through the end of 1994, and corporate
cash flow has been much stronger than it was when the pace of
economic growth was shifting down in early 1989.
For computing equipment, data on orders and shipments have been
almost uniformly negative since mid-autumn. After flattening in
November, shipments fell sharply in December and January, and orders
plummeted almost 15 percent over those three months. In contrast,
reports in the trade press suggest that the demand for PCs,
workstations, and related equipment is growing rapidly, and the
major computer manufacturers still appear to be relatively bullish.
Moreover, the Census Bureau, the agency that prepares the orders and
shipments series, has indicated that response rates for computer
firms have been abysmal, providing still another reason for caution
in interpretation of the recent orders and shipments data.
Excluding computers, the January data on orders and shipments
were highly upbeat. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft and computers advanced solidly, and orders for these goods
shot up dramatically. Bookings were especially strong in several
categories with very long delivery times: engines and turbines,
metalworking machinery, and ships.
Signals have been mixed for transportation equipment, a
category that accounts for about 20 percent of total real equipment
outlays. Business demand for light vehicles appears to have tailed
off in January and February. Sales of both domestic and foreign
vehicles declined noticeably over these two months. On the other
hand, heavy truck sales surged 17.3 percent in January and fell back
only a tad in February. With strong demand and large backlogs, the

normal seasonal pause in heavy truck sales did not occur. Aircraft
outlays were very weak in January, with shipments of complete
aircraft dropping 14-1/2 percent from their December level. While
this series is highly volatile, the drop more or less extends the
downtrend of the past twelve months.
Outlays for nonresidential structures have advanced strongly of
late, and the incoming construction data are consistent with a
continuation of recent uptrends. Construction put-in-place fell
0.7 percent in January, but the decline was concentrated in spending
by public utilities, which are experiencing a great deal of
uncertainty about the regulatory environment. Pending
deregulation, which would result in increased competition, has
apparently caused many utilities to adopt a "wait and see" attitude
toward capacity expansion. The other categories of nonresidential
construction--including office, other commercial, industrial, and
lodging--all posted solid advances in January. Leading indicators--
such as permits and contracts--while admittedly highly volatile,
still appear to be trending up, albeit a little hesitantly of late.
Business Inventories
After slowing in December, accumulation of manufacturing and
trade inventories surged at an annual rate of nearly $100 billion in
January, the highest monthly figure since last May. Stocks of motor
vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels accounted for nearly
$40 billion of the January rise. Accumulation of non-vehicle stocks
was just a touch larger than it had been, on average, over the final
three quarters of 1994. The inventory-sales ratio for all
manufacturing and trade establishments rose slightly in January but
remained low by historical standards.

place data when preparing its measure of investment by public
utilities.

In manufacturing, the published data for January showed a
sizable pickup in the rate of inventory accumulation. However, the
January estimate may be subject to more uncertainty than usual. In
particular, accumulation of inventories among producers of office
and computing equipment picked up considerably in January, but
reporting problems that seemingly are distorting the orders and
shipments data for that industry may also be affecting the data on
inventories.6 Elsewhere in manufacturing, producers of many
types of capital goods (telecommunications equipment and special
industrial machinery, in particular) added further to their stocks
in January, maintaining, in most cases, patterns of accumulation
that were evident through much of 1994. The inventory-sales ratio
for all of manufacturing edged down, on net, around the turn of the
year, with an uptick in January only partly offsetting a small
decline in December.
Increases in non-auto trade inventories slowed around the turn
of the year. At wholesale establishments, the average accumulation
of nonvehicle stocks in December and January was only about half the
pace seen over the preceding few months. All of the January
accumulation was in stocks of durable goods, extending the fourth-
quarter buildups. Inventories of nondurable goods were unchanged,
on net, as a run-up in apparel stocks was offset by drawdowns in
inventories of other products. The inventory-sales ratio for
wholesale distributors of apparel jumped in January to its highest
level in the past year, consistent with anecdotal stories that warm
6. Just as we have not been able to confirm, through industry
contacts, the reported weakness in orders and shipments of office
and computing equipment, we have not been able to find independent
evidence of a buildup in computer inventories. Although a recent
news article said that two major producers are planning to introduce
new lines of personal computers in the near future--a development
that could be prompting some intended stockpiling--most reports
indicate that demand is strong, production is rising, and
inventories are lean.

weather caused a backup of winter clothing at the retail level.
However, most other types of wholesale inventories appeared to be in
line with sales at the end of January.
In retail trade, non-auto inventories rose at just a
$3.5 billion rate in January after falling $11.3 billion in
December; the average pace of accumulation over the preceding eight
months had been more than $20 billion at an annual rate.
Inventories at general merchandisers accounted for all of the
January increase, but sales were strong, and the stock-sales ratio
moved down from its November-December high. Outside of general
merchandise, retail inventories were unchanged. For non-auto
retailers as a whole, the stock-sales ratio has been edging down
since October.
Federal Sector
The unified federal budget deficit for the first five months of
fiscal year 1995 was $94 billion. Adjusting for differences in
payroll and benefit payment schedules, the deficit for this five-
month period was 15 percent less than for the same period in fiscal
1994. The improvement was attributable to developments in both
receipts and outlays. Tax receipts outpaced GDP growth, while the
growth in outlays was more restrained.
Relatively strong growth has been evident across all major
categories of taxes. For the fiscal year to date, individual and
social insurance taxes were 7 percent higher than in the comparable

security income payments scheduled for the first day of fiscal
1995--October 1, 1994, which fell on a Saturday--were accelerated
into September. No such payment shift occurred at the beginning of
fiscal 1994.

healthy gains. Other receipts were up 14 percent, paced by strong
excise tax receipts and Federal Reserve Bank earnings.
As noted above, a major anti-fraud effort by the IRS has slowed
significantly the payments of individual tax refunds in February and
March. Individual income tax refunds paid as of March 10 were
$5-1/2 billion (more than 20 percent) lower than over the same
period a year ago. Most returns flagged by the IRS were those that
both claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit or other credits and
8
were filed electronically. Nonetheless, the staff still expects
greater individual refunds to be paid this year compared with last,
and the current refund shortfall should be made up in April and May.
Excluding deposit insurance and adjusting for differences in
payroll and benefit payment schedules, outlays have risen about
4 percent so far this fiscal year, with restraint evident in some
key programs. Defense spending (adjusted for changes in the timing
of military pay) has dropped 4-1/2 percent in nominal terms. Total
outlays for income security programs (adjusted for the supplemental
security income payment schedule) have also fallen, because of
earned incoEe tax Iredit TlaiCs and reductions in unemployment
benefits. Health-related spending is up about 8 percent in the
current fiscal year, on the low side of recent trends. By contrast,
net interest payments have increased about 14 percent for the
current fiscal year owing to rising debt levels and higher interest
rates.
On February 6. the Clinton Administration released its fiscal
year 1996 budget, which contains a set of proposals to cut taxes and
reduce spending by modest amounts. The Administration estimates
that if its proposals are accepted, the deficit will be $193 billion
8. Under unified budget accounting about half of the refund
payment shortfall is assigned to the receipts side of the budget;
the remainder--the refundable portion of the EITC--is counted under
outlays for income security.

in fiscal 1995 and edge up to $197 billion in fiscal 1996; the
estimate for fiscal 1996 includes proposed deficit reductions of
about $5 billion. The most recent baseline projection of the
Congressional Budget Office, which assumes no policy changes, shows
deficits of $175 billion in fiscal 1995 and $210 billion in fiscal
1996.
In the absence of policy changes, the deficit is likely to
increase over the next several years. OMB projects that the
baseline deficit would rise from $193 billion in fiscal 1995 to
$229 billion in fiscal 2000, while the updated baseline in CBO's
preliminary analysis of the President's budget shows the baseline
deficit reaching $299 billion in fiscal 2000. The gap between the
OMB and CBO baseline projections largely reflects OMB's more
favorable economic assumptions and its greater optimism about the
longer-term trends in outlays on health-related entitlements. The
two agencies also differ in their assessments of the amount of
deficit reduction implied by the President's proposals. OMB
estimates that the package would lower the deficit, on net, by
$81 billion over fiscal 1995-2000, but CBO sees the proposals as
having essentially no effect on the deficit through 1998 and
generating only modest savings in 1999 and 2000.
The Congress is working on the Contract with America and other
key elements of the Republican agenda. The tax provisions in the
contract have been passed by the House Ways and Means Committee;
they include middle-class tax cuts, saving and investment
incentives, and tax breaks for senior citizens; these changes are
-estimated to result in a cumulative revenue loss of nearly
$200 billion over five years. In addition, the House has passed a
package of rescissions that would cut $17 billion from the
appropriations approved by the previous Congress for fiscal 1995;

according to preliminary CBO estimates, the package would lower
actual outlays in fiscal 1995 about $2 billion, with the remainder
of the spending cuts spilling over into subsequent years. Detailed
proposals for reductions in outlays in fiscal 1996 and beyond are
only now beginning to take shape. For example, House Budget
Committee Chairman Kasich recently provided a sketch of a five-year
plan and a menu of potential cuts in discretionary spending.
Chairman Kasich has promised to release the remainder of his plan to
balance the budget in fiscal 2002 in May.
State and Local Government Sector
State and local government purchases still appear to be
expanding at only a modest pace. Employment increased 25,000, on
average, for the first two months of the year, fractionally above
the average for all of 1994. Gains were concentrated among
education workers at local governments during both January and
February. Real state and local construction spending was
essentially unchanged in January. These construction series are
very volatile, but they appear to show a leveling off of public
investment in structures in recent years after strong increases
between the mid-1980s and early 1990s (chart). Among the categories
accounting for the greatest share of outlays, spending for highways
has trended down a bit for the past year, while outlays for
9. Congressional committees are scheduled to report their budget
estimates to the House and Senate Budget Committees by the end of
March, and the budget resolution is scheduled to be completed by
April 15. However, this deadline is rarely met, and budget leaders
do not expect the resolution to be adopted until May. If the
resolution has not been adopted by May 15, the House can start to
pass fiscal 1996 appropriations anyway and is expected to approve
its versions of the thirteen appropriations bills by June 30.
Budget reconciliation is scheduled to be completed by June 15, but
this deadline is also likely to be missed. Given the complexity of
this year's budget decisions, the debate will undoubtedly be
contentious and will probably extend at least through late summer,
fiscal 1996 starts on October 1.

educational facilities and for other buildings (which include
prisons)10 have seen little upward movement for more than a year.
Incoming data on the fiscal positions of state and local
governments have been mixed. Most state governments have been
reporting higher revenues and a rosier budgetary outlook. However,
according to recent surveys, the direction of city and county
economic and fiscal conditions is not so clear. Although most
cities report that economic conditions have improved over the past
year. 38 percent of them also say that their fiscal situations have
deteriorated, up from 26 percent in 1993 and the second highest
percentage in the past eight years. Moreover, preliminary figures
from a recent survey of counties indicate that most of these
jurisdictions are experiencing some erosion in their fiscal health:
60 percent of the respondents either are having difficulty
maintaining services or are reducing discretionary programs, while
10 percent report that they are experiencing fiscal crisis. By far,
the most important concerns of cities and counties center on crime
and the impact of unfunded state and federal mandates.

Increases in materials prices, which picked up sharply in the second
half of last year, accelerated further in the first two months of
1995, and monthly increases of 0.3 percent in the CPI in both
January and February were slightly larger than the average monthly
increases in 1994. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices
jumped 0.4 percent in January and 0.3 percent in February. The
producer price index for finished goods has also picked up a bit.
The CPI for commodities excluding food and energy moved up
0.4 percent in January, but data for February showed a price rise of
only 0.1 percent. Used car prices, which had advanced nearly
9 percent in 1994, continued to climb rapidly in the first two
months of this year. Elsewhere, however, increases in the retail
prices of commodities have been more subdued. Prices of apparel
commodities rose 0.7 percent in January but reversed that gain last
month. Prices of cars and light trucks posted only small increases,
on balance, in the first two months of 1995. Tobacco prices fell,
on net, over the two months.
The CPI for non-energy services rose 0.5 percent in January and
0.4 percent in February; the average for the two months was more
than one-tenth of 1 percent larger than the average monthly increase
during 1994. Postal rates jumped in January, and auto finance
charges continued to rise sharply in early 1995. Airfares, which
had declined sharply over the course of 1994, took a couple of steps
back up in the first two months of this year. The price indexes for
owners' equivalent rent and residential rent accelerated in January,
but the February increases in those categories were small
(0.2 percent for each series).
Energy prices changed little in the CPI in early 1995, as a
January rise of 0.3 percent was partially reversed by a small

decline in February. Gasoline prices were unchanged over the two-
month period, and small declines were reported, on net, in the
prices of fuel oil and natural gas. Electricity prices jumped
0.7 percent in January and edged up slightly further last month. In
the PPI, the prices of finished energy products increased
2.3 percent in January, driven largely by a steep rise in the price
of gasoline; the February increase in PPI energy prices was much
smaller--only about 0.4 percent. Crude oil prices, as measured by
the price of West Texas intermediate, have risen moderately, on net,
since the start of the year.
Food prices have exhibited their characteristic volatility in
recent months, influenced chiefly by fluctuations in the prices of
fruits and vegetables. After shooting up in December, the CPI for
food fell 0.3 percent in January; fruit and vegetable prices dropped
2.6 percent in January, reversing about half of their December gain,
which seems to have been caused by Tropical Storm Gordon. In
February, food prices rose 0.3 percent in total. The prices of
fruits and vegetables turned back up last month, and the price index
for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs moved up somewhat faster than in
January. Prices of other foods, which account for about two-thirds
of total food in the CPI, were essentially flat, on average, over
the first two months of the year. Looking ahead, another surge in
fruit and vegetable prices could emerge in coming months, as effects
of the recent flooding in California begin to show through to retail
prices. In farming, the spot prices of a number of commodities have
moved up in recent months from the low levels of last fall, driven
in part by actual and expected increases in agricultural exports,
especially to China; however, farm prices in total still are well
below the levels of a year ago and do not seem to be a source of
much inflation pressure at the moment.

Note. Weekly data, Tuesdays. Vertical lines on small panels indicate week of last Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce index is based almost
entirely on industrial commodities, with a small weight given to energy commodities, and the CRB spot price index consists entirely of industrial
commodities, excluding energy. The CRB futures index gives about a 60 percent weight to food commodities and splits the remaining welght roughly
equally among energy commodities, industrial commodities, and precious metals. Copyright for Journal of Commerce data is held by CIBCR, 1994.

After accelerating sharply in the second half of 1994, the
producer price index for intermediate materials, supplies, and
components rose sharply further in the first two months of this
year. Excluding food and energy, prices of these intermediate
products were up 1.0 percent in both January and February. The
prices of materials for manufacturing of durables rose about
3 percent over the first two months of 1995; those for nondurables
moved up almost 4 percent. Prices of containers, responding to
tight supplies of woodpulp and paperboard, climbed about 6 percent
in the first two months of the year, to a level nearly 15 percent
above that of a year earlier. Prices for crude materials excluding
food and energy also continued to move up rapidly in the first two
months of the year; declines in February in the prices of some
metals were more than offset by substantial increases in the prices
of other primary inputs, such as cotton, hides, and wastepaper.
Breaking ranks with the recent trends in materials prices, some
indexes of spot commodity prices fell sharply in late January and
the first half of February. The Journal of Commerce index of
industrial materials prices plunged about 3-1/4 percent in a three-
week stretch, pulled down, in large part, by sharp declines in the
prices of primary metals. Since mid-February, however, the index
has turned back up and has retraced more than half the earlier
drop. Other indexes of spot commodity prices also have been moving
up in recent weeks, although, like the Journal of Commerce index,
some of these measures still show net declines for the period
between the January and March Greenbooks.11
11. Price changes for individual commodities spanned a wide range
in the intra-Greenbook period. Declines in the spot prices of
aluminum, tin, and zinc ranged from 12 percent to 19 percent over
that period. Prices of copper and steel scrap also fell somewhat.
Apart from metals, prices of many spot commodities have continued to
rise; cotton prices, in particular, have chalked up a huge advance

Labor Costs
Most indicators of labor costs remained on favorable trends
through the final quarter of 1994, and the few data available for
the first quarter of 1995 do not suggest any marked departure from
those trends in the past couple of months.
In the fourth quarter of last year, hourly compensation, as
measured by the ECI for private industry workers, rose at an annual
rate of only 2.6 percent, down from 3.3 percent in the previous
quarter. Over the twelve months of 1994, the ECI rose 3.1 percent--
half a percentage point less than the increase recorded in 1993 and,
by a slight margin, the smallest annual increase on record in a
series that goes back to 1980. Growth in the ECI for wages and
salaries slowed from 3.1 percent over the twelve months of 1993 to
2.8 percent over 1994, while growth in benefits slowed from
5.0 percent to 3.7 percent.
Much of the slowing in benefits during 1994 can be attributed
to smaller increases in health insurance and workers' compensation
costs, which together make up about one-third of hourly benefits
costs. Health insurance costs presumably were slowed by reduced
inflation in the health sector, increased use of managed care plans,
and ongoing efforts of employers to shift a greater proportion of
health care costs to employees. Costs for workers' compensation
(Footnote continued from previous page)
since late January, nearly 20 percent in total, as the market for
that product tightened further.
Supply developments appear to have played a part both in the
price declines and the price advances. Aluminum production, for
example, picked up in early 1995, as a "memorandum of understanding"
between aluminum producing countries--an agreement to reduce world
production in the face of excess supply--began to unravel.
Similarly, high prices for copper are said to have enticed increased
quantities of scrap into the markets in the United States and
Europe. In the cotton market, upward price pressures associated
with rising demand have been compounded recently by production
shortfalls in China, Pakistan, and India, three of the world's major
cotton producing countries.

are, to some degree, linked to health care costs; the slowing in
workers' compensation this past year also reflected shifts in some
states toward rules that reduce the contributions required from
businesses. Costs for state unemployment insurance also decelerated
in 1994, as would be expected as an economic expansion lengthens and
the experience ratings of firms improve. Pension costs, on the
other hand, accelerated markedly last year, largely reflecting
attempts by many firms to reduce the underfunding of their plans.
Scattered reports that workers with some types of skills are in
short supply began to appear in 1994 and have continued to surface
in recent months. However, at least through year-end, these
shortages do not seem to have shown through in any major way in the
ECI data on compensation across various occupational groups;
Between the four quarters ended December 1993 and the four quarters
ended December 1994, compensation growth declined 0.5 percentage
point for white-collar workers, 0.9 percentage point for blue-collar
workers, and 0.3 percentage point for service occupations. Even for
more disaggregated categories, unusually large increases have not
been evident in the ECI. Thus, shortages of skilled workers, to the
extent that they do exist, probably have been confined to fairly
narrow occupational specialties at a finer level of detail than is
reported in the ECI or other available indicators of labor costs.
According to revised data on productivity and costs,
compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an
annual rate of 3.4 percent in the final quarter of 1994. Although
this rate of increase was substantially larger than that reported in
the ECI, the two series often have diverged considerably on a
quarterly basis.12 Over all of 1994, nonfarm compensation per
12. The fourth-quarter gap between the rates of increase in
nonfarm compensation and ECI compensation was more than accounted
for by a faster rate of rise in the wages and salaries component of

hour rose 3.3 percent, just a touch more than the increase in ECI
compensation over the year. With a further rise in productivity
offsetting nearly half of the 1994 rise in hourly compensation, unit
labor costs in the nonfarm business sector increased 1.9 percent
over the four quarters of the year, after an increase of only
0.6 percent in 1993. In the four-year stretch since 1990, increases
in labor costs per unit of nonfarm output have averaged just
1-3/4 percent per year.
Wage data for 1995 are quite limited at this juncture.
Average hourly earnings of private production or nonsupervisory
workers rose at an average monthly rate of 0.3 percent over the
first two months of the year, with increases coming in all major
industries except transportation and public utilities. Over the
twelve months ended in February, average hourly earnings increased
2.5 percent, down somewhat from the 2.8 percent increase in the
year-earlier period.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
nonfarm compensation. This difference, in turn, seems to be
traceable to two factors: First, the ECI is computed on an end-of-
quarter basis; in contrast, nonfarm compensation is measured on a
quarterly-average basis. Second, the ECI captures changes in the
rate of pay for overtime but is not affected by changes in the
number of overtime hours (relative to straight-time hours); by
contrast, the series on nonfarm wages and salaries is affected by
both changes in overtime pay and overtime hours in manufacturing.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates beyond the very shortest term have
declined appreciably since January 31, despite the half-point
increase in the discount and federal funds rates implemented
immediately after the last FOMC meeting. The initial market
reaction was limited because the System action was fairly widely
anticipated. But the yield curve flattened subsequently as incoming
economic data were interpreted as indicating that the monetary
policy tightening over the past year was beginning to bite--to a
greater degree than had been foreseen--and thus that further policy
action might be of lesser dimension than had been anticipated. In
this context, market sentiment was further bolstered by remarks by
System officials recognizing the softer tone of the data and
suggesting that further tightening was less likely. The change in
interest rate outlook contributed to downward pressures on the
dollar against the yen and mark and buoyed bond prices, even though
they slipped temporarily in early March when the dollar declined
especially sharply.
Thus far in the intermeeting period, yields on Treasury coupon
issues have fallen 30 to 55 basis points, with the largest declines
posted at intermediate maturities. The thirty-year fixed rate
mortgage rate shed 75 basis points and, at 8-3/8 percent, is at its
lowest level since August. The growing confidence that policy
tightening has largely run its course, coupled with surprisingly
strong corporate earnings reports, boosted major equity indexes
4-1/2 percent or more during the period.
Overall credit growth appears to have been well maintained in
early 1995, although its composition may have shifted slightly.
Consumer loan growth has slowed a bit, as consumer spending has
flattened and as changes in IRS practices have curtailed the usual

burst of tax-refund anticipation loans. Business borrowing, in
contrast, has been buoyant; bank loans to businesses have been
expanding at an annual pace of more than 20 percent so far this
year, and commercial paper issuance has remained robust. Longer-
term debt issuance by nonfinancial firms has revived somewhat in the
past two months as firms have moved to take advantage of the
widespread rally in capital markets, partly to pay down merger-
related commercial paper. Municipal bond issuance has been notably
sluggish, and, with sizable retirements extending the contraction in
outstanding supply, the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields has
declined sharply.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The growth in the broad monetary aggregates slowed in February.
M2 contracted at a 1 percent annual rate, and M3 grew at a 3 percent
pace. In January, these aggregates posted gains of 4-1/4 and
7 percent, respectively. M2 growth fell off in February, in part
because of a reversal of the volatile components that had boosted
the aggregate in January: demand deposits, overnight RPs, and
overnight Eurodollars. The continued decline in OCDs and savings
deposits also showed through to pull down growth in the aggregate.
On the plus side, small time deposits grew at a 29 percent annual
rate in February, accelerating from a 23 percent growth rate in
January. Early March data suggest some pickup in the growth rates
of M2 and M3.
The disparate behavior of the components of M2 largely reflects
relative movements in opportunity costs (chart). The costs of
holding NOW accounts and savings accounts increased throughout 1994,
and for NOW accounts has widened further this year. In contrast,
1. From the fourth quarter of 1994 to February, M2 has grown at a
1-1/2 percent annual rate, putting it a little above the lower edge
of its annual range. Over the same period, M3 has grown at a 4-1/4
percent rate, leaving it slightly above its annual range.

III-4
the cost of holding small time deposits has dropped substantially
this year because of both increased retail CD rates and declines in
intermediate-term Treasury rates. In addition to high opportunity
costs, growth in OCD and savings accounts may have been damped a bit
by slower-than-usual tax refunds.
Except for the highly interest-sensitive institution-only money
market mutual funds, which contracted after the System's tightening
move, the non-M2 components of M3 were up sharply in February.
Banks continue to rely heavily on managed liabilities, rather than
retail deposits, to fund the recent run-up in bank lending, and this
has been reflected in the strength of the large time deposit, term
RP, and term Eurodollar components of M3.

Bank credit growth cooled appreciably in February, as run-offs
of U.S. government securities resumed and loan growth slowed from
its torrid January pace. Bank lending in February was pulled down
by a marked deceleration of consumer loans, which expanded at only a
2-1/2 percent annual rate after a year of double-digit growth.
Several percentage points of this deceleration likely owed to a
major cutback of tax-refund loans this year. The amount of lending
against future income tax refunds has been reduced by the
unwillingness of the IRS to send checks directly to lenders in
certain cases or to confirm in advance that a tax-refund claim is
valid. The slowdown in consumer lending is also consistent with
weakness in spending on durable goods in January and February, which
may have been partly related to delayed tax refunds but also to
sharp increases in interest rates on consumer loans.
Business loans expanded at an annual rate of more than
20 percent in January and February. Checks with a few banks
confirmed the reasons given in the January Senior Loan Officer
survey for the strength in lending--primarily financing of
inventories and plant and equipment expenditures. Merger financing
was also mentioned, although the bulk of short-term merger financing
apparently has been through commercial paper, which has continued to
trend higher. The Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business
conducted in the second week of February found that loan spreads
over market rates had narrowed slightly from the November survey--
suggesting continued bank aggressiveness in making loans, though it
is possible that the adjustment of loan rates to the System
tightening was still incomplete at the time of the survey.
Real estate loans at banks grew in February at a 9 percent
annual rate, below the January pace but in line with growth rates of
last year. The strength likely owes in part to a growing share of

loans originated at adjustable rates. Banks tend to keep a larger
share of adjustable rate mortgages than fixed rate mortgages on
their books because of their access to funds with similar durations.
Some of the strength may also reflect increased commercial real
estate lending, which accelerated through 1994 after declining from
1991 through mid-1993. Banks' commercial real estate loans in the
fourth quarter (the most current data available) grew at a 7 percent
annual rate.
The quality of bank loan portfolios continued to improve
through year-end. Fourth-quarter Call Report data show that
delinquency and charge-off rates on real estate and business loans
fell again and are now at their lowest levels in recent history
(chart). Consumer loan quality appears about unchanged in the
fourth quarter but remains much improved over the early 1990s.
Recently available data for 1994 on the thrift sector--savings
and loans, savings banks, and credit unions--show that the assets of
those institutions were little changed from the previous year,
standing at a level of roughly $1.36 trillion. This steady asset
level balances two offsetting trends: the robust growth of
mortgage-related assets at individual thrifts and the continuing
decline in the number of thrifts due to commercial bank purchases of
savings and loans. This year, however, a significant cloud hangs
over the SAIF-insured thrift institutions, because of a likely, and
substantial, difference between BIF and SAIF deposit premiums. If
no action is taken by Congress, SAIF-insured thrifts will pay about
20 basis points more than BIF-insured institutions, and a
significant flow of deposits from SAIF to BIF may develop as
institutions seek to avoid the higher premium.

Mutual Funds
Strong inflows into tax-exempt and high-yield bond funds in
February more than offset further withdrawals from government and
GNMA bond funds, leaving net flows into bond funds positive for the
first time since June of last year. However, data through mid-March
on the tax-exempt funds point to some resumed weakness in that
sector. As the stock market rallied, inflows into domestic stock
funds edged up in February and early March from the subdued pace of
2January. Although much weaker than last year, net flows into
international stock funds also picked up, despite the increased
uncertainty associated with plummeting stock prices and weakening
currencies in some emerging markets. Trade reports indicate that

some investors are seeing the weakness in these markets and other
international markets as a buying opportunity; however, those funds
investing primarily in Latin America have faced modest net
redemptions.
This spring, the Securities and Exchange Commission will issue
final amendments to Rule 2a-7 to tighten investment standards for
tax-exempt money funds. A key provision would extend a
diversification test--currently in effect for taxable funds--to
national tax-exempt funds, by prohibiting a money fund from
investing more than 5 percent of its assets in any one issuer.
However, single-state tax-exempt funds would not be subject to the
5 percent diversification test. They would, instead, be limited to
purchases of investment-grade securities.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit, while relatively strong
in January, was down from the more rapid pace set for all of 1994.
Automobile credit declined in January--the first drop since January
1993. Revolving credit expanded at about its average pace over the
past year, while "other" loans outstanding posted a sizable
increase. Total consumer credit (installment plus noninstallment)
rose at a 12-1/4 percent rate in January, near the fourth-quarter
average.
Substantially higher interest rates may have contributed some
to the slowing in auto loan growth in recent months. Interest rates
on automobile loans at commercial banks jumped almost 1 percentage
point from November to February, the sharpest increase in the more
than twenty-year history of the series. Rates on two-year personal
loans at commercial banks also rose significantly. Nonetheless,
spreads of consumer rates over Treasuries remain relatively low by

historical standards, having recovered only to about the levels of a
year earlier (chart, top panel).
The substantial growth in consumer indebtedness over the past
two years, both in nominal terms and relative to growth in personal
incomes, does not yet appear to have greatly affected the ability of
the household sector to service its debt. Staff estimates of
scheduled principal and interest payments on consumer and mortgage
loans rose only slightly in the fourth quarter, to a level still
significantly below the 1989-90 peak. Further, data on consumer-
and mortgage-loan delinquency rates remained at relatively low
levels in the fourth quarter (chart. bottom panel), although some
series recorded increases. For instance, the American Bankers
Association reported a substantial rise in bank credit card
delinquencies (in contrast to evidence from the bank Call Report),
and the auto finance companies reported higher auto loan
delinquencies. Most other available series registered small mixed
changes. The seasoning of the large volume of loans originated over
the past two years and the pickup in delinquencies usually
associated with such seasoning suggest that many of these series may
be bottoming out.
Mortgage Markets
Apart from the data on real estate lending at commercial banks,
information on mortgage lending activity in the current quarter is
scant. Total issuance of mortgage pass-through securities continues
to slow, with the January data showing a decline to a seasonally
adjusted monthly rate of about $12 billion, well below the average
monthly pace of the past few years. Weak demand for mortgage
derivative securities continues to affect the REMIC market. Trade
reports indicate that the dollar volume of CMOs/REMICs outstanding

actually declined for the first time ever last year, and issuance in
1995 remains quite low.
Although total issuance of pass-through securities slowed
sharply last year, reflecting the drop-off in overall mortgage
originations, the dollar volume of newly issued securities backed by
adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) remained strong. Nearly 40 percent
of the issuance of ARM securities in 1994 came from GNMA, whose
record volume reflected the increased popularity of FHA and VA ARMs
in the primary market. The spread of the average contract rate on
conventional fixed rate mortgages over the average initial rate on
one-year Treasury-indexed ARMs reached a record high early in 1994
(chart), leaving ARMs with a wide rate advantage relative to fixed
rate mortgages. According to the Federal Housing Finance Board's
survey of major lenders, the ARM share of conventional loans closed
rose from 24 percent a year ago to 59 percent in January, the
highest share since November 1988.
But the rate advantage for ARMs began diminishing rapidly late
in 1994 and shrank further during the intermeeting period. With the
ARM rate down only about 25 basis points since the beginning of
February--one-third the size of the decline in the rate on
conventional fixed rate mortgages--the spread contracted to about
195 basis points, close to levels last seen in March 1991. The
sharp fall in the spread--and the lower level of rates on fixed rate
mortgages--is expected to boost originations of fixed rate mortgages
relative to ARMs in coming months.
Business Finance
The recent declines in interest rates, coupled with continuing
merger activity, have led to some restructuring of corporate
liabilities. Gross offerings of bonds by nonfinancial corporations
jumped in February to $8-1/2 billion--the highest monthly total in

nearly a year--although the pace of issuance moderated in the first
half of March. Interest rate spreads over comparable Treasuries
generally remained narrow across the quality spectrum, but spreads
on lower-quality junk bonds have widened a bit further.
Bond issuance in February was boosted as two investment-grade
companies--American Home Products and Rockwell--took advantage of
the decline in bond rates to issue longer-term debt to pay down
$2.5 billion of commercial paper that had been used to finance
acquisitions last fall. Speculative-grade issuance was also very
strong in February, with more than half of the roughly $2 billion
total reflecting an offering from National Medical Enterprises to
prefund a planned acquisition. Junk issuance was characterized by a
pickup at the lower end of the quality spectrum, as issues were
placed that had not been marketed successfully last year. A
contributing factor to the spurt in junk issuance may have been
investors' renewed appetite for junk bond mutual funds; these funds
have posted steady inflows from late December through February,
although they appear to have shown a small outflow on balance in the
first half of March.
Gross issuance of equity by nonfinancial corporations also
picked up some in February and is expected to run at about the same
pace in March. For the first quarter as a whole, gross equity
issuance should about match the $3 billion monthly pace of the
previous quarter. Net equity issuance, however, is likely to remain
negative in the first quarter, owing to sizable merger-related share
retirements.
Merger activity among nonfinancial firms has continued at a
strong pace in the first quarter. Consistent with the recent
pattern, large mergers are being financed about equally by stock
swaps and cash payments. Several of the recently announced deals

III-18
have been proposed by European firms--fueled by their strong cash
positions and the weak dollar--pointing to a potential new source of
buying power in the current merger wave.
Outstanding commercial paper issuance by nonfinancial
corporations continued to expand in February, although it appears to
have decelerated from the very robust pace registered in the fourth
quarter. Even though new merger-related issues have continued to
reach the market, their effect on total outstandings has been partly
offset by the substantial paydowns, noted above, by American Home
Products and Rockwell.
Fourth-quarter earnings reports for both nonfinancial and
financial corporations were quite strong, with positive earnings
surprises outnumbering negative surprises by nearly two to one. For
an aggregate of more than 3,000 companies, operating income was
about 20 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 1993, and
about 3 to 4 percent above analysts' most recent predictions. The
technology sector, transportation (particularly airlines), and some
basic materials industries (paper and nonferrous metals) generated
the largest positive surprises. Reflecting the strong fourth-
quarter profits, the price-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 dropped to
a four-year low (chart), even as share prices have touched new
highs. Since early December, when the current rally began, stock
prices in most industry groups have moved up between 9 to
12 percent, with basic materials, technology, and financial issues
leading the pack. A notable exception in the financial category is
Bankers Trust, whose stock price declined 16 percent on news of
trading losses in the first quarter. News of financial distress
abroad--the bankruptcy of Barings Brothers and the difficulties in
Latin American financial markets--seemed to have little effect on
the equity prices of major U.S. financial institutions.

Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt fell to anemic
rates in January and February. The $7 billion of issuance in
February was the lowest rate in four years. Refunding activity has
remained light, and new capital issuance--which was fairly well
maintained in 1994--has weakened. With gross issuance outpaced by
heavy retirements, the outstanding level of long-term municipal debt
fell an estimated $18 billion over the first two months of the year.
In addition, the amount of short-term tax-exempt debt outstanding
fell $2-1/4 billion during the same time period, to roughly $32-1/2
billion--its lowest level since May 1991. As the outstanding supply1958

III-20
of municipal bonds declined, the ratio of long-term tax-exempt to
Treasury yields dropped to 85 percent, down from 91 percent at the
onset of the Orange County crisis and 87 percent at the time of the
previous FOMC meeting.
The financial condition of Washington, D.C., has continued to
deteriorate. In mid-February, Moody's downgraded the District's
bonds to junk status, and S&P dropped the District's debt to its
lowest investment-grade rating. The District is likely to run out
of cash in May and will need federal assistance if it is to make
$250 million in payments to bondholders in June. Federal assistance
could take the form of a Treasury loan or a loan guarantee.
However, before providing assistance, Congress will most certainly
mandate that a financial control board be put in place that has the
authority to enforce major cuts in spending.
Orange County began to make significant budget cuts in response
to the losses incurred by its ill-fated investment pool. The
biggest cost-cutting measure thus far has been the dismissal of

1,600 employees on March 7. The county is also considering a
1 percentage point increase in the sales tax along with asset sales
and is making arrangements to extend the maturity of the $1 billion
of its debt obligations due this summer.
Another trouble spot is New York City. On March 8, the New
York City comptroller estimated that the city's budget deficit for
fiscal 1996 will total $3.2 billion, up $500 million from the
previous estimate. At this point, Mayor Giuliani is seeking
$600 million in union concessions, service cutbacks, and asset
sales, although further cuts are likely to be needed. S&P rates New
York City's general obligation bonds A-, but this debt remains on
CreditWatch with negative implications.
Not all the news on municipal debt has been bad. Both
Philadelphia and Bridgeport, Connecticut, have received debt
upgrades from Moody's.
Treasury and Sponsored Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance the bulk
of the projected $68 billion first-quarter fiscal deficit (not
seasonally adjusted) by borrowing $63 billion from the public and,
as is normal in this quarter, by drawing down its cash balance.
Because the midquarter refunding included a thirty-year bond issue,
borrowing has tilted toward coupon issues and away from bills. New
cash raised in the bill market should total only $18-3/4 billion
this quarter, down from $36-1/2 billion in the previous quarter.
The Mexican assistance package will not have a major effect on
Treasury borrowing this quarter, though over time much of the
$20 billion in U.S. assistance will need to be financed by an
increase in U.S. Treasury obligations in the hands of the public,
and some of the foreign contributions are likely to entail sales of

Treasury securities. Of the $20 billion being offered by the United
States, only $5 billion, on net, is expected to be taken down by
Mexico during this quarter. Of that net amount, the Federal Reserve
is expected to have only $1 billion outstanding by quarter-end,
supplied through an expanded swap line with the Bank of Mexico. (Of
course, to offset the effect on reserves, the Federal Reserve will
hold $1 billion less in Treasury securities.) The remaining
$4 billion is being arranged through the Treasury's Exchange
Stabilization Fund in transactions that are expected to result in a
reduction in the Treasury's cash balance this quarter, although
ultimately the cash balance is likely to be replenished by borrowing
from the public.3 The Mexican assistance package may also have
an indirect supply effect in the Treasury market, as the
international institutions and foreign countries that have offered
the $30 billion or so of additional support begin to liquidate
dollar securities--the bulk of which may be short-term Treasury
securities--to raise cash for Mexico.
Overall borrowing by government-sponsored agencies appears to
have slowed in 1995, although at this point data for January are
still incomplete. To hedge the prepayment risk embedded in their
assets, agencies have been issuing mostly callable paper, especially
at medium-length maturities. The recent declines in interest rates
have increased the likelihood that previously issued securities will
be called, prompting a widening of spreads on existing callable
issues over Treasuries to more than 50 basis points. Only a small
amount of noncallable debt has been issued beyond the short end of
the yield curve, and spreads on such issues in secondary markets
have remained around 20 basis points.
3. The Treasury cash balance falls as an immediate result of
redemptions by the Exchange Stabilization Fund of its holdings of
nonmarketable Treasury securities.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In January, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services
widened sharply from its December level as exports fell while
imports expanded. The deficit in January at an annual rate was
significantly larger than for any quarter of 1994.

Exports of goods and services declined 5 percent in January
after increasing strongly in the preceding two months. The decline
in January was primarily in aircraft and machinery. The increase in
the fourth quarter was spread over most major trade categories and
was largely in quantity, with the exception of exported industrial
supplies (where virtually all of the increase was in price). By
area, the sharpest increases in exports in the fourth quarter were
to Western Europe and Canada.
Imports of goods and services rose 3 percent in January; the
increase was widespread among most trade categories. Imports also
rose strongly in the fourth quarter, as a 16 percent drop in the
value of imported oil (mostly quantity) was more than offset by
increases in most other trade categories. The fourth-quarter

increase in non-oil imports reflected sharp increases in the real
expenditures by households and businesses.
In January, the quantity of oil imports declined 5 percent from
the level in December reflecting lower consumption (because of
unseasonally mild weather) and inventory decumulation. Preliminary
Department of Energy statistics indicate that imports should rise
marginally in February, despite a rise in production, largely
because of higher domestic consumption. For the first quarter,
imports are expected to average about 8.7 mb/d. This compares with
imports of 9.0 mb/d in the fourth quarter of 1994, when seasonal
stock draw-downs and increased domestic production reversed the
dramatic rise in imports seen during the third quarter.
After averaging about $15.25 per barrel in December, the price
of imported oil rose moderately in January reflecting a tighter
market for lighter-end products (in response to increased Asian
demand coupled with somewhat leaner U.S. inventories) and periodic
weather-related problems (largely in Europe). We anticipate an
additional price rise in February for similar reasons as spot oil
prices (West Texas Intermediate (WTI)) remained firm throughout the
month. Currently, spot WTI is trading at $18.65 per barrel compared
with $18.00 in January.
Prices of Merchandise Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports in January showed the smallest
rise in many months. Increases were recorded in prices of imported
non-oil industrial supplies and foods; over the past twelve months
these commodities have recorded gains of 9.9 and 15.0 percent
respectively. In contrast, prices of the major imported finished
goods declined in January. Of the cumulative 3.8 percent increase
in non-oil import prices over the past twelve months, most of the
rise occurred in the July-October period.

Export price increases were strong for the fourth consecutive
month; prices rose 2.8 percent over the past four months and 4.0
percent over the twelve months ending in January. Almost all of the
rise in January (and during the past year) was attributable to
prices of nonagricultural industrial supplies which gained 2.3
percent in January and 16.4 percent over the past twelve months.
Data for February will be released on March 31.
U.S. Current Account in 1994 -- 04 and year
In the fourth quarter, the U.S. current account deficit was $16
billion SAAR larger than in the third quarter. Increased payments
of net investment income and a seasonal jump in unilateral transfers
were partly offset by a narrowing in the deficit in trade in goods
and services (exports grew more than imports rose).

Increased net payments of investment income were attributable
to both portfolio and direct investment income. Net portfolio
payments increased as a result of growing U.S. portfolio
indebtedness and higher interest rates. Net direct investment
income payments grew as earnings on foreign direct investments in
the United States continued to recover from very low levels and
receipt of income on U.S. direct investments abroad was about
unchanged.
The quantity of exported goods and services grew 12 percent
(Q4/Q4); two-thirds of the rise was in capital goods reflecting the
strength of economic expansion abroad. The quantity of imports rose
14 percent (Q4/Q4), with double-digit increases recorded in capital
goods, industrial supplies (other than oil), automotive products,
and consumer goods. The growth of imports in 1994 reflected the
vigorous growth of U.S. income during the year. Prices of non-oil
imports increased nearly 4 percent in 1994 largely because of rising
prices of non-oil industrial supplies and foods (coffee).
For the year, the current account deficit widened $52 billion.
About two-thirds of the increase was in net trade in goods and
services, and most of the rest reflected increased net payments of
investment income.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net banking inflows were very large in December, capping a
record year where net inflows through banks reached about $100
billion (line 3 of the Summary of International Transactions table).
Large inflows through banks continued in January; the total in line
3, however, is only about a third of the banking inflow because
large RP transactions by securities dealers are also reported on
this line. These robust banking inflows helped finance the large

increases in domestic bank credit registered in December and
January. For February, however, monthly average data reported in
the International Banking Data Table indicate the cessation of net
banking inflows from own offices and IBFs (lines 1 and 2a).
Foreigners purchased large amounts of both Treasury securities
and corporate and other bonds in December and January (lines 4a and
4b of the Summary table). Transactions with Canada, Japan and the
British West Indies accounted for most of January's foreign net
purchases of Treasury securities. Large placements of U.S.
corporate bonds in the Euromarket in January are reflected in line
4b; foreign currency denominated issues accounted for over half of
the total, although a number of these were later swapped into
dollars. Sales of Eurobonds appear to have continued at a somewhat
reduced, but still robust, rate in February. On the other hand,
private foreigners reduced their holdings of U.S. corporate stocks
in both December and January (line 4c).
U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks remained small in December
and fell to virtually zero in January (line 5b). Despite the
turmoil after the Mexican devaluation, U.S. net purchases of Mexican
and Latin American stocks remained positive, but very small, in both
December and January. During the same months, U.S. residents sold
foreign bonds net (line 5a). However, small net purchases from
Latin America were recorded (excluding the Caribbean financial
centers).
Foreign official assets held in the United States fell
moderately in both December and January. The major item in the
December figure was Germany's sale of troop dollars; in January,
Argentine holdings fell significantly, as well as those of the Bank
for International Settlements.

IV-11
Recently released data on direct investment in the fourth
quarter show both continued heavy outflows on the part of U.S.
businesses (line 6) and a surprisingly large rebound of direct
investment inflows into the United States (line 7). The inflow was
more than accounted for by an upsurge of foreign acquisitions of
U.S. firms, which has continued into the present quarter.
For the year, direct investment outflows and inflows were in
approximate balance at very high levels. At $58 billion, outflows
reached a new high; the year's inflow was close to the high reached
in 1989. Geographically, approximately one-third of the direct
investment outflow in 1994 went to each of Western Europe and Latin
America. Within Latin America, for the year as a whole, outflows to
Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were at or above the levels for 1993.
Only for Argentina was there any indication of a fall-off in the
second half of the year. Outflows to Japan more than doubled in
1994 to $3.7 billion.
The statistical discrepancy for the year indicated unrecorded
net outflows of $33 billion, more than reversing the unrecorded
inflow registered in 1993. The statistical discrepancy would have
been even larger had the known, but unrecorded, currency outflow of
over $20 billion been correctly included as a capital inflow.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the February 1 FOMC meeting, the dollar's multilateral
trade-weighted average value against the currencies of the other
G-10 countries has declined 5 percent. Because of the dollar's
nearly 30 percent nominal appreciation against the Mexican peso, its
decline using a broader 18 country bilateral trade-weighted index
has been only about half as large in nominal terms. (In due

IV-12
course, as the Mexican price level adjusts, the dollar's nominal
appreciation against the peso will translate into a much smaller
real appreciation.)
There appear to have been several factors contributing to the
dollar's weakness against other industrial countries' currencies
over this period. Probably the most important factor has been a
growing market perception that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
increase interest rates further in the near term. In addition, some
spillover from the ongoing financial crisis in Mexico may have
contributed to pressure on the dollar. As background factors,
market commentary has also mentioned the large U.S. trade and
government budget deficits, with attention on the latter possibly
receiving added attention following the defeat of the balanced
budget amendment in the Senate at the beginning of March.
With the dollar under strong selling pressure, U.S. authorities
intervened to support the dollar on March 2 and 3, purchasing a
total of $750 million against marks and $670 million against yen,
split equally between the accounts of the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve.
Despite this intervention, the dollar
continued to move lower, reaching post-war record lows below 89 yen
per dollar and 1.35 marks per dollar on March 8. The dollar
recovered partially against the mark later in the period, but
revisited its record low against the yen on March 21.
The dollar's recent decline against other industrial-country
currencies has not been uniform. The dollar has been weakest
relative to the yen and mark, depreciating 10 percent and 7 percent,
respectively, since the last FOMC meeting. Spillover from financial
and political unrest in Europe may have boosted the mark against the
dollar. In Japan, investors' repatriation of funds in advance of

the Japanese fiscal year end may have raised the yen relative to the
dollar. In contrast to the dollar's weakness against the mark and
the yen, the dollar has shown almost no net change relative to the
Canadian dollar over this period. A report that Moody's was
considering a possible downgrading of Canadian government debt
contributed to the Canadian currency's relative weakness. The
February 16 announcement of the new Canadian government budget,
designed to reduce the deficit through expenditure reductions and
increased taxes, gave only a temporary boost to the Canadian dollar
on exchange markets.
The mark has been strong recently against other European
currencies, having appreciated by amounts ranging from about 2
percent against the French franc to 14 percent relative to the
Italian lira since the beginning of February. Political
uncertainties in some European countries--particularly Italy, Spain,
and France--have contributed to the downward pressures on their
currencies against the mark. These pressures have created strains
within the European exchange rate mechanism. On March 5, it was
announced that the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo were being
devalued by 7 percent and 3-1/2 percent, respectively, within the
ERM.
Short-term interest
rates have also risen sharply in several European countries as their
currencies have come under downward pressure against the mark. The
largest increases have been in France and Italy, where three-month
interest rates have increased on the order of 250 basis points since
the beginning of February.
On a weighted average basis, foreign short-term interest rates
have risen about 40 basis points since the last FOMC meeting while
comparable rates in the United States have declined about 10 basis

IV-15
points. Three-month rates have declined on balance by about 5 basis
points in Germany and about 15 basis points in Japan over this
period. The U.S. 10-year government bond rate has fallen about 50
basis points since the last FOMC meeting, about twice the decline in
the weighted-average of foreign long-term rates over this period.
The German long-term rate has moved down about 30 basis points and
that in Japan has declined about 60 basis points.
The Mexican peso has depreciated about 25 percent on balance
against the dollar since the last FOMC meeting. The peso-per-dollar
rate has moved from below 5-1/2 at the beginning of February to a
peak near 8 in early March before falling back to about 7 later in
the period. The announcements of agreement on terms of the $20
billion U.S. support package for Mexico and the Mexican government's
new economic stabilization program gave the peso a temporary boost,
but in each case selling pressures on the peso reemerged. Market
participants appear to have been concerned over the health of
Mexican industry, particularly financial institutions, in an
environment of reduced domestic demand and sharply higher interest
rates, as well as ongoing political unrest.
On February 2, Mexico drew $1 billion each from its swap lines
with the System and the Treasury's ESF. Later in the period, Mexico
repaid to the System and the ESF $500 million of swap drawings made
in January, and made drawings totaling $3 billion from the ESF's
medium-term swap facility.
The Mexican stock market has also experienced periodic strong
selling pressure over this period. Since the beginning of February,
Mexican stock prices have fallen 21 percent on balance. Stock
prices in some other Latin American markets have also fallen sharply
on balance over this period, including declines of 25 percent in
Brazil and 22 percent in Argentina.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The pace of economic recovery in the major foreign industrial
economies appears to have moderated in recent months. In Japan, GDP
declined 3.4 percent (SAAR) in the fourth quarter, while growth
slowed in most other foreign G-7 countries. Only in Canada did GDP
growth rise in the fourth quarter. Moreover, recent monthly
indicators point to a deceleration of growth in the first quarter in
all countries except Japan. In Germany, the imposition of a 7-1/2
percent income tax surcharge in January likely slowed consumption
spending. In Japan, the decline in output due to the Kobe
earthquake in January is expected to be reversed by the end of the
quarter.
Consumer price inflation has remained subdued in foreign
industrial countries with the exception of Italy where it has picked
up over the last few months. Inflation has been held in check in
part by moderate increases in labor costs. However, there are
indications lately of a pickup of inflationary pressures in several
countries including, Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GDP decreased in the
fourth quarter. Large declines in personal consumption and housing
investment accounted for much of the drop, although government
investment also declined as the impact of fiscal stimulus measures
enacted earlier in the year wore off. Net exports fell, as strong
growth in exports was more than offset by even faster growth in
imports. The only component registering a significant increase was
private investment.

On balance, recent data point to a modest recovery of growth in
the first quarter. While industrial production fell in January
reflecting the effects of the Kobe earthquake on January 17th,
companies are expected to make up the production losses by the end
of this quarter. Moreover, the reconstruction effort, which could
take several years, should also contribute to the recovery in
production. Damage from the earthquake is now estimated at more
than $100 billion (2 percent of GDP). Positive indicators for the
first quarter include rises in new car registrations and housing
starts. Also, recent stability in the unemployment rate and in the
job offers/applicants ratio suggests that the deterioration in labor
market conditions has come to an end. In the Bank of Japan's
February "Tankan" economic survey, the index of business sentiment
of major manufacturing firms rose relative to the previous survey
taken in November, the fourth consecutive increase.
The combined effects of recession and yen appreciation are
apparent in recent inflation performance. In February, the Japanese
consumer price index for the Tokyo area was unchanged from its year-
earlier level while the wholesale price index declined 0.6 percent.-1 04

In western Germany, real GDP growth of 3 percent in the fourth
quarter was supported by a surge in exports and strong growth in
fixed investment. Nevertheless, GDP slowed relative to its third-
quarter pace due to a fall in consumption and slower inventory
accumulation.

Prospects for growth in the first quarter are mixed. Some
recent forward-looking indicators have been positive. The share of
firms planning to increase production in the next three months
doubled in December and remained near that level in January and
firms' assessment of their inventory situation continued to improve.
Also, unemployment declined in February. However, other
considerations point to a slowing of growth in the first quarter.1994

The reimposition of the 7-1/2 percent solidarity income tax
surcharge in January should restrain consumption, and unusually cold
winter weather is expected to have reduced construction spending.
Strikes in the engineering industry also may have had some effect on
output, although the impact will be limited if the wage contract
negotiated in Bavaria is accepted by the rest of the industry as
expected. The recent sharp appreciation of the DM probably will not
affect foreign demand immediately, since export contracts typically
are made several months in advance, but it could begin to have an
impact on production later this year if the strength of the DM is
sustained.

Although the western German unemployment rate has been fairly
stable at about 8-1/4 percent over the past year wage growth shows
signs of accelerating. The 4 percent wage increase in the
engineering industry's contract and the reduction in the workweek
scheduled for later this year will bring the increase in hourly wage
costs to about 5 percent. Several other industries have also
recently negotiated wage settlements on the order of 4 percent.

IV-21
This contrasts with average settlements of a little over 2 percent
last year.
West German inflation has been stable. Consumer prices in
February were 2.4 percent above their year-earlier level, up
slightly from the 2.3 percent increase registered in January.
However, signs of inflationary pressure have begun to appear in
other measures. Wholesale prices in February were 3.4 percent above
their year-earlier level, the largest annual increase since December
1989. Import prices also have begun to accelerate in recent months,
although DM appreciation should help mitigate this increase.
German M3 in February was 3.8 percent (SAAR) below its level
in the fourth quarter of 1994, compared with a decline of 5.6
percent registered in January. However, M3 was 3.7 percent above
its level in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Eastern German GDP grew 9 percent in 1994 from its average
level in 1993. This growth was largely due to investment,
particularly in construction.
In France, GDP growth of 2.4 percent (SAAR) in the fourth
quarter resulted from rapid investment growth, especially in the
business sector, and strong contributions from inventories and net
exports. Growth slowed from its strong third-quarter pace due to
weak consumption that was depressed by special factors.
Monthly indicators are mixed for the first quarter. The
February business survey by INSEE suggests that production increased
moderately and is expected to continue to increase but at a slower
pace. Foreign orders registered a strong gain in January but
weakened in February along with domestic orders. INSEE's January
survey of investment intentions showed that industrialists intend
to increase real investment 12 percent in 1995, a substantial
improvement compared with the previous survey in October 1994. The

IV-22
number of unemployed declined sharply in January, but this only
reduced the unemployment rate to 12.3 percent from 12.4 percent.
Consumption of manufactured products, equal to one-third of total
consumption, declined 1.9 percent (SA) in January, suggesting that
consumption will continue to be weak in the first quarter. INSEE's
survey of consumer confidence stabilized in February after declining
in January.

Consumer prices in January and February were 1.7 percent above
their year-earlier levels, up slightly from the record low of 1.6
percent registered in December. This good inflation performance is
partly due to a slowing of wage inflation. Hourly wage increases
slowed in the fourth quarter, and wages stood 2.4 percent above
their year-earlier level.

In the United Kingdom, growth of non-oil GDP slowed in the
fourth quarter as the negative contribution of net exports more

than offset the effects of stronger investment and inventory
accumulation. However, GDP inclusive of oil production grew more
strongly, increasing at roughly its third-quarter pace, due to a
surge in oil production.

Indicators for the first quarter have been mixed. In January,
industrial production declined. Also, retail sales were flat on
average in January and February and consumer confidence weakened in
the first quarter. The purchasing managers' survey reported a
pickup in output and a surge in new orders while producer sentiment
increased sharply in February. In February, the unemployment rate
fell slightly to 8.4 percent.

The impact of rapid increases in manufacturers' input prices
over the past year on inflation were offset in large part by falling
unit labor costs. Unit labor costs have stabilized in recent
months, however, and both producer-price inflation and underlying
retail-price inflation have begun to increase.
In Italy, monthly indicators point to some slowing of growth
in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 1995 from the robust
pace registered earlier in 1994. Industrial production rose 0.9
percent (SA) in the fourth quarter of 1994, down from the 3.7
percent rise registered in the third quarter. The slowdown partly
reflects a general strike in October and serious floods in November.
The unemployment rate jumped to over 12 percent (NSA) in the fourth
quarter as employment in all sectors of the economy declined. The
ISCO business survey, conducted in late January, revealed a slight
improvement in business confidence and pointed towards a modest rise
in output in the first quarter.

Inflation in Italy has begun to rise. In February, the
consumer price index was 4.3 percent above its year-earlier level,
up from 3.8 percent in January. Signs of inflationary pressure were
also evident in wages, which in January were 2.7 percent above their
year-earlier level after registering an increase of 1.9 percent in

IV-25
December. Wholesale and producer price inflation have also
increased sharply in recent months.
On March 22, the Italian parliament completed approval of the
supplemental 1995 budget. This supplemental budget, which reduces
the budget deficit by 1 percent of GDP, is intended to allow the
government to reach its 1995 deficit target of 8 percent of GDP.
Roughly three-quarters of the deficit reduction results from tax
increases. Increases in the VAT and excise tax on gasoline are
expected to increase consumer prices by 0.7 percent this year.
Economic activity in Canada expanded at an unexpectedly
vigorous pace in the fourth quarter of 1994, with strong growth in

Preliminary data for the first quarter are mixed. Employment
and the unemployment rate have been flat since the end of 1994.
However, in January, the manufacturing survey showed another surge
in factory shipments and retail sales increased.
Signs of inflationary pressure are evident in recent price
data. Industrial product prices rose sharply in January, reflecting
both recovery in world commodity prices and the depreciation of the
Canadian dollar. In January, consumer prices excluding the effects
of recent excise tax cuts were 2 percent above their year-earlier1994

On February 28, Finance Minister Paul Martin presented the
budget for the current fiscal year and the 1995-96 fiscal year. The
budget calls for the deficit to fall to 4.2 percent of GDP in the
1995-96 fiscal year, and to 3 percent of GDP in the 1996-97 fiscal
year. These targets had been questioned in light of the sharp
increase in debt-service costs that resulted from the recent
increase in interest rates. The budget projections are based on
conservative economic assumptions and involve a mix of deep spending
cuts and moderate tax increases.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Policymakers in Mexico and other Latin American countries
continued to struggle with emerging or potential crises. On
March 9, the Mexican government announced a strengthened stabiliza-
tion program aimed at improving the fiscal situation and the
condition of its banking system. Argentina also put together
an economic package with the assistance of the IMF and other
multilateral agencies. In Brazil, a run on the currency was halted
by a substantial increase in overnight call money rates and a
further modification of the exchange rate regime.
Russia and the IMF agreed to a $6.4 billion stand-by
arrangement. China and the United States reached an agreement on
enforcement of intellectual property rights, thus defusing trade
frictions.
Individual country notes. On February 1, the IMF approved a
18-month stand-by arrangement for Mexico of SDR 12.1 billion (about
$18 billion, including an originally programmed $7.8 billion plus
supplemental support of $10 billion). It called for a moderate
further tightening of monetary and fiscal policy beyond that
included in the emergency economic plan announced by Mexico on
January 3.
On January 31, the Clinton Administration announced that, as a
result of heavy Congressional opposition, it was dropping its
initial proposal to provide Mexico $40 billion in securities
guarantees. Instead, the United States would provide $20 billion in
the form of short-term swaps, three- to five-year swaps, and
securities guarantees maturing in five to ten years. Most of these
funds would be provided through the Exchange Stabilization Fund,
while the Federal Reserve would participate in short-term swaps of
up to $6 billion.

IV-31
The Administration also announced that the BIS would consider
doubling its commitment from $5 billion to $10 billion.
Simultaneously, the IMF announced plans to supplement this support
with an additional $10 billion to be provided by central banks and
governments outside the BIS. In the event that the resources
provided by central banks and government fell short of the targeted
$10 billion, the difference would be committed by the IMF itself.
In the wake of these announcements of support for Mexico, both
the peso and the Mexican stock market initially strengthened
sharply. However, financial markets soon weakened in response to
uncertainties concerning the timing and implementation of the
support package. The signing of the support package agreement with
the U.S. Government on February 21, as well as a 10 percentage point
increase in interest rates on peso-denominated Treasury instruments
on the eve of the signing, failed to restore investor confidence.
Delays in the announcement of new stabilization measures, along with
political turmoil associated with the arrest of former president
Salinas' brother, who was accused of having masterminded the
assassination of PRI Secretary General Ruiz Massieu last September,
contributed to further downward pressures in financial markets.
The government's strengthened stabilization program, which was
finally announced on March 9, includes the following elements:
o A minimum wage increase of 10 percent, effective April 1,
bringing the total projected minimum wage increase for 1995 to
almost 18 percent.
o Elimination of the pacto between government, business, and labor,
and its provisions for wage and price guidelines.
o Increases in the public sector revenues totalling 0.7 percent of
GDP, reflecting substantial increases in public sector energy
prices, and an increase in the value-added tax rate from 10
percent to 15 percent for most goods, except at border locations.
o A reduction in non-interest government expenditures equal to 0.3
percent of GDP, primarily reflecting reduced wages and salaries.
o As a result of these measures, the primary (non-interest) fiscal
surplus in 1995 is projected by the Mexican authorities to rise

IV-32
from 3.4 percent of GDP under the January program to 4.4 percent
of GDP under the March 9 program. However, because public sector
interest costs are projected to be 1.1 percent of GDP higher
under the March program, the overall balance of the non-financial
public sector is projected to decline slightly from 0.6 percent
of GDP under the January program to 0.5 percent of GDP under the
March 9 program.
o Establishment of new rules on reserve requirements allowing banks
to hold a zero balance with the Bank of Mexico, on average, over
the period of a month. Under the previous system, banks were
required to hold a zero balance on a daily basis.
o Measures to support the banking system, including:
--A voluntary program for banks to restructure loans and deposits
by indexing the value of the principal to the level of a "Unit
of Investment" based on the CPI. This measure is intended to
help firms faced with paying the very high inflationary premia
embedded in nominal rates of interest.
--Strengthened commitment to provide liquidity to solvent banks
through the purchase from banks of subordinated debt.
--Development of a program, in conjunction with the Mexican
Association of Bankers, to restructure the debt of small- and
medium-sized firms whose repayment capacity has been adversely
affected by the macroeconomic situation.
o Maintenance of the current floating exchange rate regime, at
least for the near future.
o Continued adherence to the limit on net domestic credit creation
by the Bank of Mexico, established under the IMF stand-by
arrangement, of 10 billion new pesos in 1995, consistent with
monetary base growth of about 17 percent, well below the 29
percent increase in nominal GDP projected to occur under the
March 9 program.
Reflecting response to the depreciation of the peso, consumer
prices rose 4.2 percent in February following increases of 3.8
percent in January and 0.9 percent in December; February prices were
14.3 percent above their year-earlier level, compared with 7 percent
inflation for 1994. The merchandise trade balance registered a
surplus of $0.45 billion in February 1995, after deficits of $0.5
billion in January, and $1.7 billion in December 1994. Exports rose
31 percent from year-earlier levels in the first two months of 1995,
while imports fell by about 2 percent. Real GDP grew 3.5 percent in
1994, up from only 0.6 percent in 1993, with output rising 5.2
percent over its year-earlier level in the fourth quarter. However,

IV-33
industrial production was only 0.1 percent above its year-earlier
level in December after showing a 6.5 percent rise in November. The
weak December 1994 performance reflects exceptionally high
industrial production in December 1993.
In Argentina, consumer prices rose 4.8 percent in February from
a year earlier. Gross international reserves stood at $12.8 billion
as of March 17, of which $2.1 billion are in Bonex bonds. The
monetary base was $11 billion, leaving only $1.8 billion in excess
reserves.
Mexico's crisis has prompted a shortage of liquidity in
Argentina's banking sector. In response, the central bank has
lowered its minimum reserve requirements, allowed banks to use 50
percent of their vault cash as reserves, extended the period that
the central bank can lend to financial institutions in need from a
maximum of 60 days to an indefinite period, and used approximately
$800 million in excess reserves to help ailing banks.
In an effort to stem the confidence crisis affecting Argentina,
the government has announced several fiscal austerity measures. The
latest fiscal package, announced on March 13, augments the spending
cuts announced in previous packages with a proposed increase in the
VAT tax rate from 18 to 21 percent and increases in tariff rates.
The package also includes a reactivated Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
arrangement from the IMF of $2.4 billion, including roughly $400
million available under the original three-year program, and about
$2 billion made available by extending the program to a fourth year.
The program is likely to be approved in early April. New World Bank
and IDB loans of $2.6 billion in total ($1.3 billion each) are also
expected.
In addition, the government in conjunction with private
domestic corporations and foreign banks will place a bond, called

IV-34
the "Bono Argentino," for a total amount of $2 billion. These bonds
will have a three-year maturity with quarterly coupons that can be
used at 100 percent of face value to cancel future tax liabilities
with the Argentine government. Overall, the new package involves $7
billion from international organizations and the "Bono Argentino,"
about $2.4 billion in domestic sources of financing such as receipts
from privatizations and sales of government shares in privatized
companies, and $2 billion in expenditure cuts. The government
expects that the package will be sufficient to cover the $5.2
billion in amortization payments and about $4.1 billion in interest
payments on foreign debt needed in 1995.
Consumer price inflation in Venezuela was 2.4 percent in
February, down from 3.1 percent in January. The central bank's
official reserves have fallen recently; as of February 17, reserves,
excluding gold, stood at an estimated $7.6 billion, down from $8.5
billion at the end of December 1994.
In early February, the authorities closed three banks that had
been subject to government-monitored recapitalization plans since
August 1994. This brings the total number of banks that either have
been closed or nationalized, or are currently subject to a
recapitalization plan, to 18. These banks accounted for over 60
percent of total banking system deposits at end-1993, but for only
about 35 percent by end-January 1995, reflecting the "flight to
quality" of deposits. The government has announced the
reorganization of the Emergency Financial Board (JEF), which
oversees the handling of Venezuela's banking crisis, and has
stripped the Depositor's Guarantee Fund (FOGADE) and the
Superintendency of Banks of any authority on the JEF.
In Brazil, real GDP growth in 1994 was revised upward from 5.3
to 5.7 percent. Inflation has remained relatively low by Brazilian

IV-35
standards; monthly inflation has been 1-2 percent since December
1994. Economic activity appears to have remained strong in January
and February 1995; production in several sectors has been at near
capacity.
Brazil registered a trade deficit of $0.3 billion in January
1995, and unofficial reports indicate that the deficit was as high
as $1 billion in February. The Brazilian government has maintained
that the country will have a trade surplus of $5 billion in 1995.
During the week of March 6, a run on the real, the new currency
introduced in July 1994, was precipitated by a 2.3 percent
devaluation of the de facto band within which the real has been
allowed to float against the dollar, and by the announcement that
the lower limit of the band would be devalued by a further 9 percent
in early May. To support the real, the overnight call money rate
was raised from 40 to 70 percent on March 10, the lower limit was
devalued a further 3 percent, and exchange and capital controls on
outward flows of capital were tightened. These measures stabilized
the real, and calmed the stock market. The central bank has
subsequently intervened to keep the exchange rate within the upper
limit of the new band (0.88-0.93 reais/dollar). As of March 21, the
exchange rate was 6 percent below its level on March 6. The central
bank's foreign reserves have fallen from $41 billion in November
1994 to an estimated $32 billion as of mid-March 1995.
In China, industrial value added rose 14 percent in the first
two months of 1995 from a year earlier, down from 18 percent growth
for 1994 as a whole. Consumer prices were reported to be 22 percent
higher in February than a year earlier. Strong export growth led to
a trade surplus of $4.5 billion in the first two months of 1995.
Exports rose 70 percent from the year-earlier period, while imports
rose 17 percent.

IV-36
Inflation continues to be a major concern of policymakers. At
the annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) in early
March, Premier Li Peng pledged to bring inflation under control by
slowing output growth from double-digit levels to 8-9 percent in
1995, and by forgoing any new price reforms. The NPC also approved
a new law that codifies the role of the central bank in formulating
and implementing monetary policy. However, the central bank's
ability to conduct monetary policy remains dependent on the
political will of the State Council, China's Cabinet.
In late February, the United States and China defused serious
trade frictions by reaching agreement on the enforcement of
intellectual property rights in China. In mid-March, the United
States and China announced that negotiations for China's accession
to the WTO would reopen in April.
In Taiwan, real GDP rose 6.5 percent in 1994. Strong import
growth reduced the current account surplus from $6.7 billion in 1993
to $6 billion in 1994. This was the smallest surplus since 1984.
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rose to $93 billion at the end of
1994, up $9 billion from the end of 1993.
Consumer prices rose 4.3 percent in the first two months of
1995 from the year-earlier period. In the first two months,
Taiwan's trade surplus was $0.8 billion, with exports up 21 percent
and imports up 17 percent over the year-earlier period.
Real GDP in Korea increased by 9.3 percent during the fourth
quarter of 1994 from its level a year earlier. The manufacturing
sector expanded at a particularly strong pace. Despite robust
growth, inflation remains quite low and has even decreased somewhat
over the past year. Consumer prices increased by 4.2 percent in
February from a year earlier.

IV-37
Merchandise exports increased by about 16 percent in 1994.
However, merchandise imports grew by 22 percent over the same
period, in part because of very strong investment demand. This
import growth contributed to a current account deficit of $4.8
billion in 1994, compared with a surplus of $0.4 billion in 1993.
On March 10, Russia and the IMF signed a joint policy statement
outlining conditions for a one-year $6.4 billion stand-by
arrangement. Russia aims to reduce monthly inflation to one percent
by December 1995 and has agreed to limit the 1995 fiscal deficit to
5.5 percent of GDP, down from 10 percent of GDP in 1994. Russia
took a number of actions to qualify for this agreement, including
implementing a restrictive monetary policy during the first quarter
of 1995 and liberalizing the export sector. The stand-by
arrangement calls for monthly performance reviews (rather than the
usual quarterly reviews), which will govern access to monthly
disbursements.
During the first two months of 1995, monthly inflation has
remained in double digits, reaching 17.8 percent in January (a 12-
month high) and 11 percent in February. The ruble continues to
depreciate rapidly against the dollar, falling by 12 percent during
January, 10 percent during February, and 6 percent during the first
three weeks of March.
Industrial production during January and February was only 3
percent lower than a year earlier, compared with a 26 percent
(year/year) drop during the first two months of 1994. The IMF
estimates that Russian exports during 1994 totalled $63.5 billion, 6
percent higher than in 1993. Imports during 1994 were $50.3
billion, up 11 percent from the previous year.
