text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Growth of real GDP appears to have slowed substantially in the
current quarter, and resource utilization has declined.
Manufacturing output likely will fall appreciably this quarter,
mainly reflecting an inventory correction that is centered in the
motor vehicles sector, and construction activity will be held down
by the slump in housing starts since the turn of the year.
Increases in consumer and producer prices picked up a bit in the
first four months of this year, even as compensation increases
remained subdued.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market report for April showed essentially no change
in the levels of payroll employment and aggregate hours and a spurt
in the unemployment rate to 5-3/4 percent. Although possible
technical problems call into question the results of that report, a
slowing of the growth of labor demand is indicated by other
information as well. Notably, initial claims for unemployment
insurance have moved up considerably in recent weeks.
With respect to the April data, the BLS believes that a
combination of special factors and seasonal adjustment difficulties
likely depressed reported job growth last month. Most notably, five
weeks elapsed between the March and April survey periods in each of
the past three years, leading the seasonal factors to expect sizable
job gains in April. This year, however, only four weeks elapsed
between the surveys, and the BLS's seasonal adjustment technique
makes no specific allowance for the length of the interval. The
greatest impact of the missing week was probably in industries such
as services, retail trade, and construction, in which job increases
normally are quite large at this time of year. The BLS has produced

estimates of the understatement ranging from 70,000 to 230,000.1
Our own estimate of the understatement--based on seasonal adjustment
procedures that take explicit account of the survey interval--is at
the low end of the BLS range, leaving the adjusted April increase
well below the average monthly gain during the first quarter of
234,000.
Manufacturing employment, which does not exhibit large seasonal
flows in early spring and thus is less vulnerable to the recent
seasonal adjustment difficulties, declined in April for a second
consecutive month. Apart from metals and machinery, most
manufacturing industries lost jobs over the past two months.
Elsewhere in the goods-producing sector, construction employment
fell 20,000 in April after a sizable weather-related surge in March.
In the service-producing sector, retail trade employment
increased moderately in April, after accounting for the strike at
grocery stores. By contrast, services added a mere 6,000 jobs last
month, compared with an average increase of 133,000 per month in the
first quarter. Notably, jobs in personnel supply services declined
for a second straight month after three years of rapid growth.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the weakness in personnel supply
services is partly associated with a softening of demand for
temporary workers by manufacturers.
The civilian unemployment rate jumped 0.3 percentage point in
April. However, seasonal adjustment difficulties associated with
the timing of the survey week likely boosted the unemployment rate a
bit. In addition, the household data continue to be clouded by the
1. In addition, the BLS estimates that a strike by supermarket
workers took 32,000 workers off the job. However, the net effect of
the strike on the employment figures may be less because many stores
apparently hired replacement workers and because some striking
workers whose last pay period overlapped the survey week may have
been included in the payroll data. Furthermore, the late start of
the baseball season may have depressed April employment in retail
trade, transportation services, services, and local governments.

redesign of the CPS. The seasonal adjustment factors for the
unemployment rate are calculated from a time series that includes
only one previous April under the redesigned CPS. Concurrent
seasonal adjustment factors, which include this April's data, would
put the unemployment rate at 5.7 percent.
Industrial Production
According to our initial estimates, industrial output dropped
0.4 percent in April after no change in February and a 0.3 percent
decrease in March. The decline last month in manufacturing output
was slightly larger, and factory utilization fell to 83.5 percent,
more than 1-1/2 percentage points below its peak at the turn of the
year.
Roughly one-half of the decline in manufacturing output in
April was the direct result of a cutback in the production of motor
vehicles and parts. Assemblies fell to an annual rate of 12.1
million units in April, 3/4 million units below the March pace. And
with sales dropping sharply and inventories rising to uncomfortable
levels, producers' assembly schedules call for output to be down
nearly 1 million units further in May.

to auto production. Output has also fallen in several other
cyclically sensitive sectors. Notably, in response to sluggish
demand, there have been widespread reductions in production of non-
auto consumer durables, such as furniture and appliances. In
addition, output of construction supplies has fallen more in the
past three months than in any previous three-month period since the
beginning of the current expansion in early 1991. Production of
business equipment (excluding autos and trucks) registered only a
small gain in April despite the strong uptrend in orders for capital
goods; the strong orders may reflect in part the weakness of the
dollar against the yen and the deutsche mark.
Since peaking at 85.2 percent around the turn of the year, the
factory operating rate has fallen more than 1-1/2 percentage points
and now stands about midway between its recent high and the long-run
average of 81.3 percent. This easing reflects both the declines in
production in recent months and the stepped-up pace of capacity
growth estimated for this year. The utilization rate for primary
processing industries has posted an even greater decrease;
nonetheless, at 88.3 percent, it remains high by historical norms,
and prices for intermediate materials continued to post sizable
increases through April.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles fell nearly 12 percent in April, to
a 13.3 million unit annual rate (FRB seasonals). Although much of
the weakness has been in consumer sales, confidential data from
General Motors and Ford suggest that fleet sales were especially
weak last month. Fleets tend to be heavy purchasers of mid-sized
cars, the category accounting for the bulk of the decline in car
sales in April (chart).

So far this year, light vehicle sales have averaged 14-1/2
million units at an annual rate, compared with the 15 million unit
rate posted for 1994 as a whole.2 The drop has been widespread
across types of vehicles and has affected both foreign and domestic
models. The weakness in sales could be an indication that the pent-
up demand accumulated during the early 1990s has been satisfied.
Sales probably also have been depressed by higher auto finance
charges; these rates have risen about 3 percentage points over the
past year. In addition, many respondents to the Michigan survey
cited high prices as a deterrent to car purchases.
At the low April sales pace, the days' supply of domestic autos
at dealers jumped to about 85 days--well above the desired level of
60 to 65 days. Days' supply of domestic light trucks moved up as
well, but the April level of about 70 days was less worrisome than
that for autos.
As noted, assemblies of both autos and trucks likely will be
down sharply in May. This week Chrysler announced new sales
incentives on many models and for the industry as a whole,
additional incentives, coupled with restrained production, are
likely through the summer. However, prior commitments to parts
suppliers constrain manufacturers' ability to trim production
further through the end of the current model year.
Personal Income and Consumption
The revisions to the retail sales data indicate that spending
has not been so weak as suggested by earlier estimates.
Nonetheless, consumption growth in the first quarter was still
2. We do not have a good explanation for the plunge in sales in
April, but it is worth noting that assessments of buying conditions
for cars in the Michigan survey also plummeted last month. The
buying conditions index recovered in early May to a level comparable
to the average for the fourth and first quarters.

appreciably below last year's pace, and the second quarter appears
to be off to a slow start.
The drop in motor vehicle purchases in April depressed total
retail sales, which fell 0.4 percent in nominal terms. Sales in the
retail control category, which excludes automotive dealers and
building materials and supply stores, are estimated to have
increased 0.3 percent in April, and the data for earlier months were
revised up to show little net change over February and March. Given
the revisions, we estimate that real outlays for goods other than
motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of about 3-1/2 percent in the
first quarter, well above the 2 percent rate in the advance GDP
release. However, based on the advance retail sales data, the level
of these outlays in April was only about the same in real terms as
the first-quarter average.
Although much of the slowdown in spending this year has been in
motor vehicles, spending for other durable goods has also
decelerated considerably after three years of extraordinary growth.
Outlays for furniture and household equipment other than
electronics, which posted an 11 percent (annual rate) increase in
the second half of 1994, were little changed in the first quarter--
likely influenced to an extent by the slower pace of home sales.
Real outlays for electronics, which had grown at a blistering
30 percent annual rate in the second half of 1994, rose less than
10 percent in the first quarter. It is too soon to know whether
spending on home electronics is slowing because pent-up demand for
these products has been satisfied or whether consumers are merely
taking a break before embarking on another spending binge. Among
nondurable goods, the most notable development this year has been
the flattening of apparel expenditures, which had increased at an
11-1/2 percent annual rate in the second half of 1994.

In contrast, outlays for services other than energy continued
to trend up in the first quarter at about the 3 percent annual rate
that was recorded in 1994. Transportation was the only major
category of services for which first-quarter growth was weak, but
the level of this series had been temporarily boosted in the fourth
quarter by an airline fare war.
Real disposable personal income grew at a 4-1/2 percent annual
pace in the first quarter, and the personal saving rate rose from
about 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter to about 5 percent in the
first quarter.3 Delays in income tax refunds probably depressed
consumption and boosted the measured saving rate in the first
quarter, although the pattern of retail sales through April suggests
that the effect may have been small. (BEA's estimates of income
allocate tax refunds smoothly over the course of the year and thus
make no allowance for the delays in refund disbursements in early
1995.) Looking to April, the combination of essentially no change
in hours worked and an increase of 0.6 percent in average hourly
earnings points to a brisk gain in labor income.
Recent readings on consumer sentiment have been mixed. The
Michigan SRC index declined somewhat in early May because of less
optimistic assessments of current and prospective personal financial
situations and of expected business conditions over the next twelve
months and five years. Even so, the overall sentiment index
remained in the high and relatively narrow range that has been
evident since the end of 1993. Moreover, the Conference Board
confidence measure jumped in April, largely because of more
favorable expectations about near-term business conditions and
employment opportunities.
3. The currently published saving rate for the first quarter is
5.2 percent. All else equal, the revisions to retail sales will
lower it by slightly more than 0.1 percentage point.

The consumer debt service burden has been increasing gradually
since bottoming out in late 1993, but it remains well below the
levels of the late 1980s and early 1990s. An adjusted measure of
the debt service burden, which includes regular monthly payments on
leased vehicles, is also substantially below the highs of a few
years ago.
Housing Markets
Housing starts were virtually unchanged in April at an annual
rate of 1.24 million units. Both single-family and multifamily
starts--and permits--were about flat from March to April.
Though it was not true of last month's starts figures, other
recent indicators point to some firming in the demand for single-
family homes. This is not surprising, given that rates on fixed-
rate mortgages have fallen about 140 basis points since the recent
peak in mid-December. Initial rates on adjustable rate mortgages
have fallen 75 basis points since mid-January. Sales of both new
and existing homes rose moderately in March, after declining
appreciably over the first two months of the year. More recently,
the improvements in April and May in homebuying attitudes, builders'
assessments of new home sales, and purchase applications at mortgage
bankers all support the view that demand has started to rise.
But, at least through April, single-family construction
evidently continued to be damped by a relatively large inventory of
new homes for sale. The stock of unsold new homes rose in March to
349,000 units, the highest level in nearly five years, and the
months' supply ratio remained well above average (chart). Moreover,
in the past year, completed houses have accounted for a growing
proportion of the rising inventory. The substantial cost of
financing unsold finished units is an inducement for builders to cut
back on construction.

Multifamily housing starts last month continued to run well
below the level of permits. Although there is no clear-cut
explanation for the gap, discrepancies of this magnitude are not
uncommon and tend to be reversed within several months. Data on
vacancy rates and residential rent suggest that the realignment of
supply and demand in the apartment market has continued. The
vacancy rate for multifamily rental housing has remained below
9 percent since mid-1994, the lowest sustained readings since the
mid-1980s (although still well in excess of the long-run average).
Also, residential rent in real terms continued to rise in the first
quarter (chart).
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment remained extremely strong in the
first quarter. Real outlays rose nearly 20 percent at an annual
rate, with substantial increases in both equipment and construction.
Advance indicators point to further growth over the near term,
although gains are likely to be smaller than those of the past
several quarters.
On the equipment side, data on new orders for nondefense
capital goods suggest that shipments will post another solid advance
in the current quarter--probably reflecting sizable increases in
both producers' durable equipment spending and exports. Excluding
computers and aircraft, orders rose a whopping 7-1/2 percent in the
first quarter, and backlogs continued to increase. New orders for
computing equipment also shot up in February and March after a dip
around the turn of the year, and trade reports indicate that demand
remains strong in all segments of the market. Moreover, product
innovations continue at a rapid pace. For example, Intel plans to
roll out faster Pentium processors in coming months, and the next

generation Intel processor, the P6, is scheduled to be available in
PCs and multiprocessor servers by late October.
Transportation equipment is the one area in which some
retrenchment appears likely. Business purchases of motor vehicles
reportedly plunged in April. Likewise, outlays on aircraft probably
will drop back after spurting in the first quarter to their highest
level in almost two years. Domestic demand for aircraft remains
weak, and unfilled orders have continued to trend down. In
contrast, all the major producers of heavy trucks are operating at
capacity, and deliveries should remain high in the current quarter.
Although a falloff in new truck orders earlier this year has reduced
the backlog, that backlog is still large enough to sustain strong
production volumes for some time.
On the whole, the fundamental determinants of equipment
investment, which tend to lead spending by a few quarters, remain
relatively favorable. The user cost of capital goods continues to
be held down by the ongoing decline in computer prices and is
benefiting from rallies in the stock and bond markets this year. In
addition, financial reports suggest that corporate cash flow was
fairly healthy in the first quarter. However, the accelerator
effect, as proxied by the four-quarter change in output growth, no
longer appears to be providing much impetus to the growth of
investment.
Outlays for nonresidential structures have risen appreciably
over the past several quarters. Spending advanced at a 14 percent
annual rate in the first quarter, reflecting widespread gains among
the various components. Permits for nonresidential structures,
which tend to lead construction by a few months, have continued to
trend up, although the rate of advance appears to have moderated a
bit recently. During the past half year or so, permits for

industrial structures have been especially strong, while growth in
permits for office buildings and other commercial structures appears
to have slowed. Real spending for structures by public utilities
rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the first quarter because of
heavy spending by telecommunications companies; many electric
utilities apparently have put their investment plans on hold,
because of concerns about the implications of actual and potential
changes in the regulatory environment.
Inventories
Investment in manufacturing and trade inventories surged to an
annual rate of $105 billion in book-value terms in the first
quarter, $40 billion more than the average for the second half of
1994. Increases in stocks of motor vehicles at the wholesale and
retail levels accounted for about $30 billion of the first-quarter
stockbuilding, and the imbalance in this sector has led to sizable
cuts in production. Nonvehicle stocks also accumulated at a brisk
pace, and, although the aggregate non-auto inventory-to-sales ratio
has remained in a relatively narrow range since late last summer,
scattered signs of imbalances have emerged.
Much of the non-auto accumulation this year has been in stocks
of business equipment, which continued to grow at a rapid pace at
both the factory and wholesale levels. Capital goods orders overall
are probably firm enough to justify most of this accumulation. By
contrast, producers and distributors of construction supplies,
steel, and some other materials built inventories through early 1995
in anticipation of continued firm demand--and perhaps in some cases
as a hedge against price increases. But with demand in these
industries slowing more than had been anticipated, efforts to trim
stocks have contributed to the recent slowdowns in industrial
production. Similarly, the disappointing pace of retail sales has

resulted in a backup of stocks of furniture, appliances, and
apparel, and production of these goods has been cut appreciably over
the past few months.
Federal Sector
BEA estimates that real federal government purchases decreased
at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent in the first quarter. Real
defense spending declined about 7 percent, while real nondefense
purchases were essentially flat.
The unified federal budget deficit for the first half of fiscal
year 1995 was $144 billion, 4 percent lower than for the same period
in fiscal 1994. The decline resulted from a 6-1/2 percent increase
in receipts and a more restrained 4-1/2 percent rise in outlays.
Monthly Treasury Statements from October through March show
4growth in all major categories of receipts. For the fiscal year
to date, receipts from individual income taxes and social insurance
taxes are 5 percent higher and 7-1/2 percent higher, respectively,
than in the first six months of fiscal 1994. Corporate income taxes
are up 6-1/2 percent. Federal Reserve earnings, which represent
more than half of the "other" receipts category, have been
particularly strong, reflecting the higher interest rates this
fiscal year.
Daily Treasury Statements indicate that nonwithheld tax
collections from April 1 through May 17 were $86 billion, up
$20 billion from the same period in 1994. Nonwithheld taxes in 1995
include final payments on income tax liabilities from 1994 and prior
years, estimated tax payments on 1995 liabilities, and social
4. Receipts in March 1995 were slightly lower than in March 1994,
largely because of a calendar anomaly that resulted in five weekly
refund payments this year compared with four in 1994. In addition,
corporate final payments, which were due by March 15, probably were
weakened by changes in the tax law that required corporations to pay
a greater portion of corporate tax liability as estimated payments
throughout the year.

security and Medicare taxes from the self-employed. The robust
growth in nonwithheld tax payments reflects the strong gains in
income of the past year and a change in tax payment rules that
allowed individuals to delay a larger share of payments on 1994
liability to the April 17 due date for final payments.5
The pace of refund issuance has picked up appreciably in the
past several weeks, and the shortfall that occurred earlier in the
year appears to have been eliminated. Refunds issued through May 12
totaled $82 billion, $7 billion more than in the comparable period
of 1994 and about in line with the normal pattern once income growth
is taken into account.
Federal outlays, excluding deposit insurance, have risen about
5 percent so far this fiscal year. Roughly 40 percent of the
increase is attributable to higher interest payments. Spending on
Medicare and other health programs has also continued to grow, with
spending up 8 percent over the comparable period of last year; this
rate of increase is consistent with recent trends but is
significantly lower than the rates at the beginning of this decade.
Outlays for education have also risen sharply, largely reflecting
the artificially low level of spending last year, when the Student
Loan Marketing Association prepaid some outstanding Federal
Financing Bank loans two years ahead of schedule (these prepayments
were scored as negative outlays). Payments for income security and
5. Under current safe harbor provisions, taxpayers with adjusted
gross income (AGI) in 1993 of less than $150,000 can avoid IRS
penalties for late payments of 1994 taxes if payments in 1994
(including the estimated payment in January 1995) were at least as
great as the lesser of 90 percent of 1994's tax liability or
100 percent of 1993's tax liability (the so-called "previous year's
safe harbor"). For higher-income taxpayers, the previous year's
safe harbor is 110 percent of their 1993 tax liability. These
provisions are looser than the law that applied to estimated and
final payments on 1993 liabilities. Under that law, taxpayers were
denied the option of the previous year's safe harbor if their AGI
was greater than $75,000, or had jumped more than $40,000, or if
they had paid estimated taxes or penalties for underpayment of
estimated taxes in any of the previous three years.

defense were relatively high in March, but much of the increase can
be explained by differences in payment schedules between this March
and last.6 For the fiscal year to date, outlays for income
security were about the same as a year earlier, while defense
spending was down 4 percent.
Both the Senate and the House budget committees have passed
budget resolutions that contain sizable spending cuts in fiscal 1996
and aim to balance the budget by fiscal 2002. Official CBO scoring
for the bills has not been released, but estimates provided by the
Senate Budget Committee for, its plan show a path of steady deficit
reduction that results exclusively from spending cuts. By contrast,
the House Budget Committee plan includes the tax cut passed by the
full House earlier this year; it shows a smaller improvement in the
deficit from fiscal 1996 to fiscal 1999 and sharper decreases
thereafter. Floor debate on these bills is scheduled to begin this
week.

6. Because April 1 fell on a Saturday, outlays of $5.7 billion
were accelerated into March ($2.6 billion for military active duty,
$1.4 billion for veterans benefits, and $1.7 billion for
supplemental security income benefits). Because a similar event
occurred in September and October of 1994, such payment shifts have
only a small net effect on the data for the fiscal year-to-date.
The extra payment date for refunds this March also boosted spending
slightly because the refundable portion of the EITC is counted as an
outlay for income security.

II-33
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments were little changed in the first quarter after having
grown 2 percent over 1994. The slowing in the first quarter was
concentrated in construction spending, which fell after three
quarters of solid increases. Purchases of other goods and services
remained on the gradual uptrend that has been evident over the past
few years. State and local employment increased nearly 20,000 per
month, on average, over the first four months of 1995; most of the
advance this year has been at local governments. The recent
employment gains have been about in line with the average over
1992-94.
Although many cities and counties have not yet resolved their
financial problems, the fiscal news from the states remains upbeat.
Preliminary figures from the National Association of State Budget
Officers (NASBO) indicate that revenues are coming in at or above
projected levels and that most states expect to close out fiscal
1995 (which ends June 30 for most states) with their general fund
budgets--the primary accounts for financing day-to-day operations--
in good shape. For the states as whole, year-end balances in these
accounts are expected to exceed 5 percent of expenditures for the
second year in a row (chart). Meanwhile, almost half the states
have finalized their budgets for fiscal 1996. A fair number of
states are expected to enact tax cuts, but most will be small. The
legislatures in Virginia and New Mexico have already rejected
sizable rollbacks, and opposition to the large tax cuts proposed by
the governors of California, Massachusetts, Nebraska, and Wisconsin
is strong. On the spending side, states are continuing to focus on
anti-crime measures and reforms to welfare programs.

Prices
Inflation has been more rapid in recent months, offsetting the
good news of late 1994. Indeed, excluding food and energy, consumer
prices increased 0.4 percent in April and have risen 3.1 percent
over the past twelve months--the highest reading on this basis since
December 1993. Materials prices, which had picked up sharply in the
second half of last year, have continued to rise rapidly.
The CPI for food increased 0.7 percent in April after remaining
unchanged in March. Food prices were pushed up by a surge in fruit
and vegetable prices resulting from the March floods in California.
However, spot prices of vegetables have since retreated, and the
spike in retail prices should be largely reversed over the next
couple of months.
Retail energy prices increased 0.4 percent in April, about
reversing the decline in March. Gasoline prices at the pump rose
0.6 percent in April, consistent with increases in crude oil prices,
while utility rates have changed little on balance over the past two
months and also over the past year.
The CPI for goods other than food and energy rose 0.2 percent
in April, as compared with increases of 0.1 percent in the two
previous months. Prices of new cars and trucks rose 0.6 percent and
0.8 percent, respectively, in April, the largest increases in more
than two years. The weaker dollar has boosted the prices of foreign
models and--because of lessened competition--may also be raising the
prices of many domestic models. Used car prices rose another
0.4 percent in April, bringing the increase over the past year to
nearly 16 percent.
The CPI for services other than energy increased 0.4 percent in
both March and April. Automobile finance charges increased
1.1 percent in April to a level 32 percent above a year earlier.

and animal feeds.

II-37
The increase in this component added 0.2 percentage point to the
twelve-month change in the CPI excluding food and energy. Available
information on recent interest rate developments suggest that there
should be little further rise in these charges. Airfares continued
to move up in March and April and, so far in 1995, have largely
reversed their decline over 1994. Airlines are finding it easier to
fill seats and are operating in the black once again. Whether the
rising price trend will persist is questionable, however: With
hundreds of planes parked on runways and in the desert, additional
capacity is readily available.
After several years of decelerating prices, inflation in
medical care services appears to have leveled out. CPI prices of
medical services increased 0.4 percent in both March and April, in
line with the trend increase of about 5-1/4 percent over the past
year. The twelve-month change in the PPI for hospital care, a
narrower but conceptually superior measure to the CPI, has been
around 3-1/2 to 4 percent since late 1993.7
Prices of intermediate materials have continued to increase
rapidly and have begun to push up prices at the finished level. The
PPI for nonfood, nonenergy intermediate materials increased
0.4 percent in March and 0.7 percent in April. Although these
increases are smaller than the back-to-back 1 percent increases in
the first two months of the year, they are still large enough to
have pushed the twelve-month increase in this PPI measure to nearly
8 percent, compared with a 1 percent increase over the year ended in
7. The CPI is believed to overstate inflation in the medical
services sector because it focuses on the costs of physician visits
and days in the hospital (rather than the cost of treating an
ailment), does not account for quality changes, and is based on
"list" prices that exceed the prices actually paid by most insurers,
managed care plans, and government programs. By contrast, the PPI
for hospital care is based on treatment paths and explicitly
attempts to monitor transactions prices. It has been available only
since December 1992.

April 1994 At the finished level prices of nonfood, nonenergy
items have increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate so far in 1995 up
from an increase of 1.6 percent over the twelve months of 1994
Movements in prices of major industrial spot commodities have
been mixed since the week of the March Greenbook. Prices of most
metals have risen--notably steel scrap prices are up 3-1/2 percent
largely offsetting their decline since the beginning of the year
Zinc and tin prices have also gone up, and also offset much of their
declines since the beginning of the year Copper prices, however
fell markedly, more than offsetting gains since the beginning of the
year Cotton and rubber prices have also moved down after posting
large increases in the first three months of the year Among major
farm crops, prices of corn and wheat have moved up since the last
Greenbook, apparently reflecting concerns over weather related
planting delays. Prices of soybeans however; have edged down,
Labor Costs
Trends in labor compensation remained favorable in early 1995
According to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) hourly compensation
for private industry workers rose at an annual rate of just
2.3 percent from December to March; this was the second small
increase in a row and held the twelve-month change in the ECI to
2.9 percent the lowest twelve-month reading since the series began
in 1980 The deceleration in the ECI was centered in benefits,
which rose at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent in the first
quarter and were up only 3 percent over the past year Growth in
wages and salaries has held steady at around 3 percent per year
since 1993 The moderation in benefit growth has reflected a
continuing slowdown in the rate of increase in health insurance,
workers' compensation, and state unemployment insurance costs, In
addition, employers' payments to retirement funds, which had soared

BLS.

II-45
in 1994 as firms came under pressure to shore up the funding of
defined-benefit pension plans, have been rising less rapidly of
late.
Under some circumstances, decreases in benefits costs may lead
to offsetting adjustments in other components of employees' real
compensation packages For example, to the extent that employers
are offering less attractive health insurance plans to workers (or
increasing workers share of health insurance costs) we might
expect to see some offset over time in faster growth of other
components of compensation or in slower increases in prices
However these relationships are loose, and we have not been able to
find evidence of regular short-run tradeoffs in the historical data.
The deceleration in ECI compensation has been spread widely
across occupations and industries. By occupation, the only
exceptions are skilled white collar and unskilled blue collar
workers. By industry, only wholesale trade posted a significant
acceleration.
In the union sector the ECI measure of hourly compensation
rose 2.6 percent in the twelve months ended in March, 1 percentage
point less than over the preceding twelve months These data are
consistent with the latest BLS data on major collective bargaining
settlements, which showed the average effective change in wage rates
for the 5.4 million workers covered by major contracts- -both new and
continuing--dropping to 2.6 percent in the year ended in the first
quarter of 1995, compared with an average increase of 2.9 percent
during the previous year Moreover wage increases specified over
the life of new contracts reached during the first quarter of 1995
were more than a percentage point less than those specified in the
contracts they replaced. Information from the Bureau of National

Affairs on contracts negotiated so far this year is broadly
consistent with the BLS data
Preliminary data from the BLS's productivity and costs release
indicate that average hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter of
1995 substantially more than suggested by the ECI The disparity
between the two measures is attributable in part to differences in
the treatment of benefits costs, shifts in the industry mix of
employment and an increase in the ratio of overtime to straight,
8
time hours. In any event quarterly movements in these two
measures of compensation rarely match. In fact, since the ECI began
in 1980, the mean absolute difference between the two measures on a
quarterly basis has been 1.6 percentage points Nonetheless, the
series tend to grow by similar amounts over longer periods of time,
and both suggest that hourly compensation has risen roughly
3 percent over the past year
After remaining essentially unchanged in the second half of
1994, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector rose at an
annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 1995, reflecting
a 4.1 percent increase in compensation and a 0 7 percent increase in
productivity Over the past four quarters, unit labor costs have
risen about 1 1/2 percent compared with an increase of only
1/4 percent over the preceding four quarters. This pickup in unit
labor costs is more than accounted for by a slowdown in productivity
growth; hourly compensation actually rose less rapidly than over the
preceding year
8. The ECI uses current survey data to measure benefits while the
compensation-per-hour data often extrapolate from the recent past
On the other hand, the compensation-per-hour measure included a
large pension contribution by General Motors that was not included
in ECI benefits, By design, the ECI does not capture either shifts
in the industry mix or changes in the number of overtime hours

After holding fairly steady in the first quarter of 1995
average hourly earnings (AHE) jumped 0.6 percent in April bringing
the increase over the past twelve months to 3.J percent However
this series is volatile; indeed, the last two monthly increases in
the vicinity of 0.6 percent (in January 1995 and October 1994) were
followed by low readings over the subsequent two months Judging by
the chain-weighted AHE, as seasonally adjusted by the Board s staff
AHE growth in April would have been 0.7 percent if not for mix
shifts among industries.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The FOMC's decision at its March 28 meeting to keep money
market conditions unchanged largely confirmed market expectations
for System policy, and most interest rates showed little response.
In the weeks that followed, though, rates edged lower as data
pointing to slower economic growth solidified market expectations of
no further System tightening. Additional evidence of decelerating
activity, including the figures on April employment and auto sales,
gave fresh impetus to the bond rally in early May, which produced a
particularly sharp decline in rates at intermediate maturities.
Large increases in the April producer and consumer price indexes put
only a mild dent in the market's enthusiasm, and bond prices soon
moved up again in connection with a rebound in the dollar.
Short-term rates have shed as much as 30 basis points over the
intermeeting period, and yields on Treasury coupon securities have
fallen more than 1/2 percentage point. The pattern of federal funds
and Eurodollar futures rates can now be read as suggesting that
market participants see a greater chance of System easing than of
tightening later this year. Private rates have about kept pace with
the decline in Treasury yields, preserving narrow quality spreads.
Rates on municipal debt have fallen by smaller amounts, reflecting
concern that tax reform might erode that sector's relative
attractiveness. Major stock price indexes are up 4-1/2 percent to
7 percent on generally stronger-than-anticipated earnings reports as
well as the lower interest rates.
Borrowing by the business and household sectors appears to have
remained strong so far in the current quarter. Although bond
issuance by nonfinancial firms was subdued through April, offerings
have picked up in response to the latest drop in rates. In
addition, businesses have continued to borrow substantial sums from

banks and have stepped up their use of commercial paper. Evidence
on household borrowing activity this quarter is scant, but banks
recorded a big increase in consumer loans in April.
Total bank credit advanced sharply in April. With managed
liabilities providing much of the funding for this expansion, M3
posted further substantial growth--including a noticeable pickup in
its M2 component.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Tax effects substantially boosted M1 and M2 in April.
Nonetheless, M1 expanded at only a 2 percent rate, while M2
increased at a 4 percent rate and moved up toward the midpoint of
its target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The growth of M3
matched the previous month's relatively rapid gain of 6 percent, and
the aggregate continued to exceed the upper bound of its target
range of 0 percent to 4 percent.
The individual components of M2 continued to exhibit widely
disparate movements. Small time deposits recorded another hefty
increase, as interest rates on this component have risen
substantially more than those on other deposits. Other checkable
deposits edged up after several months of declines, but savings
deposits experienced another large contraction.
The pattern of tax payments and tax refunds likely affected the
liquid components of the aggregates more strongly this April than in
past years. Nonwithheld personal tax liabilities tend to boost
liquid deposits in the period before a tax date as individuals build
balances in advance of writing checks to the IRS. Nonwithheld tax
obligations ran higher this April than last because of the stronger
economy in 1994 and because of rule changes that allow individuals
to delay a larger share of payments until April. Furthermore, since
mid-March, individual tax refunds have been running above last

year's pace, in part catching up from earlier processing delays
caused by IRS efforts to detect fraudulent claims for refunds. Both
of these effects probably strengthened the liquid components of M1
and M2 (including money market mutual funds) in April, partly
offsetting the lagged effects of previous increases in overall
opportunity costs of holding M2 assets.1
Bank credit accelerated to a 14 percent annual rate of growth
in April. Much of the faster growth reflected a cessation of the
heavy run-offs of U.S. government securities observed over the
previous two months. Other securities were again boosted by
increases in the market value of off-balance-sheet derivatives
contracts, which accounted for an estimated 4 percentage points of
bank credit growth in April. An accounting interpretation by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FIN 39), adopted in January
1994 for regulatory reporting of off-balance-sheet contracts, limits
the ability of banks to net contracts in a gain position (carried as
assets) against those in a loss position (carried as liabilities)
and thereby has the effect of grossing up the balance sheet. At
times, the FIN 39 requirement has strongly influenced measured bank
credit growth (table).2
The major components of bank loans strengthened in April from
the previous month. Growth in real estate loans picked up some,
although not to the elevated pace of the first quarter as a whole;
net gains continued to be held down by run-offs of commercial real
estate loans at U.S. offices of foreign banks. Consumer loan growth
1. broadened its sweep account program at the
beginning of May, which should depress Ml substantially for the
month. However, the program will have no effect on M2 because it
moves NOW account balances into MMDAs.
2. Call Report data show that these asset and liability items
tend to move together, suggesting that bank equity has not been as
heavily exposed to movements in interest and exchange rates as
either side of the balance sheet alone. This result is not
surprising, given that the major bank dealers in derivatives
probably hedge the risks of conducting their customer business.

III-8
in April (with and without adjustment for securitizations) was
marginally ahead of the brisk pace in March. The May Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey indicated some softening of demand, on
balance, for residential mortgage, home equity, and consumer
installment loans. In contrast, for commercial mortgages, the share
of bankers perceiving a pickup in demand slightly exceeded that
seeing a decline. The willingness of banks to lend in these areas
held nearly steady or increased a bit: Virtually all respondents
reported unchanged standards for mortgage loans, while a few banks
expressed greater willingness to make consumer loans and none said
they were less willing.
Business loans at banks grew at a 15-3/4 percent annual rate in
April. The recent strength in this category largely reflects heavy
financing needs for inventories and for plant and equipment, though
some banks responding to the May opinion survey also cited merger
financing as a major factor in recent loan growth, especially for
larger firms. The few banks reporting changes with regard to
lending standards were in the direction of ease, and a large number
of banks reported easing terms.
Mutual Funds
Investors' purchases of stock fund shares remained strong in
March and April, while bond funds posted small net outflows after a
moderate inflow in February. Most types of bond funds have
experienced net outflows since February; the exceptions are funds
that specialize in corporate bonds and those that mix stocks and
bonds. Among stock funds, inflows into international funds picked
up in April, reflecting renewed investor interest now that equity
prices in emerging markets are generally viewed as having bottomed
out.

Taxable money market funds posted a sizable net inflow over
March and April, with most of the inflow invested in commercial
paper. In contrast, tax-exempt funds have experienced no net
increase in assets so far this year.
Business Finance
With businesses concentrating much of their fund-raising in
bank loans and commercial paper, gross public offerings of bonds by
nonfinancial corporations in March and April continued at a level
only somewhat above the weak volumes recorded during the second half
of last year. However, the recent decline in long-term interest
rates has spurred a pickup in bond issuance. Merger activity has
contributed to total offerings, as several companies each have
issued about $1 billion of bonds since mid-April to finance the cash
portion of recent acquisitions. But some firms involved in merger
transactions have elected to issue private placements with

registration rights under SEC rule 144A; this avenue enables them to
raise funds quickly and then to exchange a private issue for a

SEC filing requirements.
Quality spreads on corporate bonds have remained narrow. For
example, the interest rate spread between bonds rated Baa by Moody's
and those rated Aaa tightened to 57 basis points in April, only
1 basis point above the lowest monthly spread since 1980. Spreads
on junk bonds also declined slightly through April. The tightening
of spreads owes partly to the light supply of new bonds, but
investors also seem comfortable with the financial positions of most
U.S. corporations. Investor confidence has been mirrored in the
commercial paper market as well, where the spread between yields on
medium-grade and high-grade paper has remained very tight by
historical standards.
Issuance of commercial paper was strong again in April, as
firms continued to find the market very receptive to new offerings.
Much of the issuance has been used to fund mergers or to repurchase
shares, as was the case for DuPont, which recently issued
$8.5 billion in paper to buy back most of its shares owned by
Seagrams. Gross issuance is expected to remain heavy, as firms
involved in recently announced merger deals plan to use paper for
the initial financing. At the same time, there have been
substantial paydowns of previously issued merger-related paper,
which has limited the net impact of mergers on the amount of
commercial paper outstanding.
Merger activity in the nonfinancial sector has been buoyant
since the last FOMC meeting. Seven new deals valued at more than
$1 billion each have been announced. Indeed, the spate of recently
announced deals suggests that the value of mergers completed in 1995

III-12
could exceed the record set in 1989. As was the case last year,
most of the recent deals have been concentrated in a few
industries--most notably, health care and pharmaceuticals, and
telecommunications and media. Consistent with the pattern of
financing in the second half of 1994, about half of the deals have
been structured as stock swaps, implying far less reliance on cash
payments than during the 1980s. Accordingly, the recent merger wave
has not prompted a deterioration in overall credit quality in the
nonfinancial sector. In fact, during the first quarter, Moody's
merger-related rating changes were generally upgrades because of
expected synergies from these transactions and the relatively small
amount of debt needed to finance them.
Most of the recent mergers have been strategic, intra-industry
deals: however, the attempted takeover of Chrysler by Kirk Kerkorian
could signal the beginning of a new wave of hostile leveraged
buyouts. Kerkorian believes that Chrysler has hoarded too much cash
and seeks a larger payout in the form of dividends or share
repurchases.3 At present, Kerkorian's bid appears doomed, as he
has failed to line up the necessary financing. It is possible,
though, that this theme will arise elsewhere: A number of U.S.
corporations have built up large cash reserves to weather a possible
recession; thirty-five companies reportedly have more than $1
billion in cash, and for some of these firms, the ratio of cash to
the market value of equity exceeds the 30 percent ratio of Chrysler.
Bolstered by declining interest rates and reports of strong
profits, the stock market has continued the rally that began last
December. The major stock price indexes have moved up between

In December, Chrysler upped its dividend by 60 percent in response
to earlier pressure from Kerkorian.

III-13
4-1/2 percent to 7 percent since the March FOMC meeting, and
13 percent to 16 percent since the end of last year. First-quarter
earnings reports for nonfinancial corporations generally came in
above market expectations, with positive earnings surprises
outnumbering negative surprises by nearly two to one for the fourth
consecutive quarter. Profit margins remained at their highest
levels since the late 1970s. Some of the largest positive surprises
were in the computer industry (Digital, Intel, IBM, Sun
Microsystems, and Microsoft) and in chemicals (Dupont, Dow Chemical,
and Eastman Chemical).
Despite the stock market advance, gross issuance of equity by
nonfinancial corporations continued at a slow pace through April.
The relatively few offerings brought to market early in May, along
with the sluggish pace of new registrations, suggest only a limited
increase in issuance this month.
Mortgage Markets
The average contract rate on conventional fixed-rate mortgage
(FRM) loans declined roughly 50 basis points, to 7-7/8 percent,
between the March FOMC meeting and early May. The fixed-rate
decline has exceeded the drop in the average initial rate on
conventional adjustable-rate mortgages indexed to one-year Treasury
yields. As a result, the spread between the initial rates on fixed-
and adjustable-rate mortgages dipped below the relatively narrow two
percentage points that already had prompted some rebound in the
popularity of fixed-rate loans recently. According to the latest
data from the Federal Housing Finance Board, the ARM share of all
newly originated loans declined in March for the second consecutive
month, to 44 percent from a peak near 60 percent in January (chart).
Market participants expect that if the recent lower levels of
mortgage rates persist, refinancings will rise over the next few

months to about 20 percent of total origination volume, from around
10 percent now. In particular, many mortgage borrowers who have
ARMs issued with sizable initial-period discounts are likely to
switch to fixed-rate credit as those ARMs reach their reset dates.
Currently, initial rates on FRMs are well below the fully indexed
levels (index plus margin) for one-year Treasury ARMs (chart).
Without further rate declines, however, refinancing is unlikely to
reach the pace in 1992-93, as up to 65 percent of outstanding
mortgages today have rates that are at or below current levels.
Sufficient data are not yet available to gauge the pace of home
mortgage lending activity in the current quarter. However, a
slowdown in single-family construction expenditures, offset in part
by a pickup in mortgage refinancing, suggests the more moderate pace
of borrowing evidenced in the first quarter likely has continued.
In the secondary market, gross issuance of agency pass-through
securities edged lower in March, while net issuance was about flat.
Issuance of private-label mortgage-backed securities jumped in
April, largely reflecting a sizable $1.3 billion deal from the
Resolution Trust Corporation, its first residential mortgage
security this year. In the multiclass sector, agency-backed REMIC
volume totaled only $1.5 billion in April, 20 percent below the
already-low level registered in March. Fannie Mae issued by far the
largest volume, including one issue that represented the agency's
first major entry into the home-equity loan security market.
Only limited information on measures of aggregate mortgage
credit quality are available for the first quarter. Results from
Freddie Mac indicate a slight weakening in credit performance, as
delinquencies on loans held in portfolio edged up for both
single-family and multifamily mortgages. Freddie Mac attributed the
uptick to continued declines in house prices in California and parts

of the Northeast. Although the delinquency indicators remained well
below the average levels for 1994, Freddie increased its loss
provision in response to the weaker results.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit moderated only a little
further during the first quarter. A strong rebound in March nearly
offset the slower pace over the first two months of the quarter,
leaving growth for the quarter as a whole at an annual rate of
13-1/2 percent. The revolving credit component continued its strong
advance of the past several quarters, averaging a 22 percent rate of
growth. As a result of the slower pace of new-car sales, growth in
automobile credit tapered off to a 7-1/4 percent rate last quarter
from a 12 percent gain in the fourth quarter; relatively strong
used-car sales probably kept auto credit from slowing more than it
did. The "other" category--mainly personal cash loans, non-auto
sales finance contracts, and home improvement loans--decelerated to
a 10 percent rate of increase for the first quarter as a whole.
So far, only limited evidence has accumulated to suggest that
the substantial rise in consumer installment debt since mid-1993 has
significantly increased the financial strains on households.
Despite the rapid expansion of such debt, declines last year in the
average interest rate paid on the outstanding stock of debt tended
to offset increasing principal payments. On balance, the

because of the low levels from which the rise began, new loans were
still coming on stream at rates lower than the average on existing
loans. In the auto loan area, however, rates on new loans about
equaled the average rate on the stock of auto debt by the first
quarter of 1995, so that the downward push of lower interest costs
on scheduled payments had effectively ended.

payments relative to income has edged up over the past two quarters
but is well below the 1989 highs (chart).5
Little information on loan payment performance is yet available
for the first quarter. Most consumer loan delinquency rates at the
end of last year stood near their lowest levels in two decades.
However, one series for which first-quarter data are available--
delinquency rates on auto loans at the captive auto finance
companies--rose fairly sharply (chart). This series, which had
turned higher in the first quarter of last year, may be providing an
early warning signal of increased financial strains on some
households. Its performance may also be reflecting a somewhat
riskier loan mix brought about by the shift toward leasing in new-
car financing, which has left the captives holding a greater share
of higher-risk used-car contracts.
Consumer willingness to use credit for major purchases, as
measured in the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer
sentiment, has changed little over the last few months but does
indicate a more cautious attitude than was apparent last spring and
summer (chart). As discussed above, bank loan officers also have
noticed some slackening lately in consumer loan demand.
State and Local Finance
A five-month municipal bond rally abruptly reversed course in
the last week of April as underwriters had difficulty placing new
supply. Although tax-exempt rates have fallen, on balance, since
the last FOMC meeting, the ratio of long-term tax-exempt yields to
taxable yields jumped to 88 percent in early May, reportedly because
of increased investor concerns about tax reform. However, the

debt service burden would raise these measures about 1/2 percentage
point recently compared with about 1/4 percentage point in 1990.
Thus, the inclusion of leases would not significantly alter the
picture of household debt service burdens.

increase in the ratio of tax-exempt to taxable yields occurred at
shorter maturities as well, even though it is extremely unlikely
that a flat tax or consumption tax would be implemented before 1997.
Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt during March and
April increased somewhat from the anemic rates in January and
February. Nonetheless, so far this year, gross issuance has been
40 percent below its pace during the same period last year.
Refunding activity has remained light, and new capital issuance has
been slightly below the year-ago rates. Retirements continue to
outpace gross issuance, and we estimate that the level of long-term
municipal debt outstanding fell $20 billion over the first four
months of the year.
The negative net issuance owes to the retirements of bonds
issued during the municipal market boom in the mid-1980s. Over the
past three years, state and local governments locked in favorable
interest rates by advance refunding a substantial amount of the debt
issued during those earlier years. They are committed to calling
and retiring the defeased debt on its first call date. Such
retirements will amount to an estimated $64 billion this year alone,
which suggests that net issuance will continue to be negative
through the remainder of the year.
Overall, state and local financial conditions, as measured by
ratings changes, have been relatively stable. On balance, Standard
and Poor's downgraded somewhat more municipal debt in the first
quarter than it upgraded, but Washington, D.C., alone accounted for
much of the dollar volume of downgrades.6
Nevertheless, a few other notable trouble spots remain evident.
For example, the rebounding California economy has been set back by
6. Even with the new oversight board, which may be in place by
the end of June, the District is not expected to balance its budget
for at least a couple of years.

III-22
the financial crisis in Mexico, a major export market for the state.
Governor Wilson has proposed a 15 percent across-the-board cut in
state personal and corporate income taxes, and his budget continues
to rely on unrealistic expectations of large federal subsidies for
services provided to illegal aliens. California's controller
characterizes the proposed budget as creating enormous fiscal risk,
and it faces an uncertain fate in the California legislature.
It is becoming increasingly likely that Orange County will
default on its more than $1 billion in short-term obligations due
this summer. Orange County and its noteholders continue to press
ahead with their negotiations to roll over payments due this summer.
As a result of this likely default, investors have been less
receptive to note issuance by municipalities throughout California.
Such note issuance during the first four months of 1995 was
$222 million, down from $3.5 billion during the same period in 1994.
Moreover, California note issuers are paying for credit enhancement
on a much higher proportion of notes issued in 1995.
The U.S. bankruptcy court approved Orange County's settlement
with the participants of its ill-fated investment pool.7 Pool
participants will receive 77 cents on the dollar in cash, with the
remainder of their investment covered by notes and IOUs. All
participants have accepted this settlement and, thus, have given up
the right to sue Orange County. The county plans to issue
$1 billion in new debt in order to extricate itself from bankruptcy.
The California Senate has approved a number of measures that, if
also approved in the House, would increase the likelihood of such
debt being successfully issued. These measures would, for example,

make it easier for Orange County to sell off assets and would permit
motor vehicle registration fees to collateralize new debt.
New York City also continues to face major financial hurdles.
Mayor Giuliani has proposed the sharpest budget cutbacks in the
city's budget since World War II, yet his latest proposed budget
still depends on nearly $1 billion in uncertain state aid. New York
City is now behind in meeting its pension obligations, and another
payment to its pension fund is due later this month. S&P continues
to carry New York City's $23 billion in outstanding general
obligation bonds, currently rated A-, on CreditWatch with negative
implications.
Federal Finance
The inflow of federal tax receipts is projected to result in a
budget surplus of $24.4 billion in the second quarter. The staff
anticipates that this surplus will be used to replenish the Treasury
cash balance, with basically no net marketable borrowing, as the
Treasury is expected to pay off nearly $35 billion in bills while
raising a similar amount with coupon issues. To meet this latter
need. Treasury auction sizes are being raised at all maturities. In
May, the Treasury increased the one-, two-, and five-year offerings
$500 million each. The auction sizes of three- and six-month
Treasury bills have also been increased, from $23.2 billion in April
to $25.6 billion in May. Similarly, in the mid-quarter refunding,
the Treasury also announced increases of $500 million in the size of
the auctions of three-year and ten-year notes. At the press
conference to announce the mid-quarter refunding auctions, Treasury
said it was studying the possibility of issuing floating-rate and
index-linked securities.
Borrowing by government-sponsored agencies, especially the

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In February, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was
substantially smaller than in January. Exports, which had dropped
sharply in January, rose in February to just under their record year-end
level. Imports, which had jumped up in January, eased in February.
Nonetheless, for January-February combined, the deficit at an annual
rate was larger than in the fourth quarter. Data for March will be
released May 18 and included in the Greenbook supplement.

The level of exports of goods and services for January-
February combined was about the same at an annual rate as in the
fourth quarter. A decline in exports of automotive products to
Mexico, aircraft, and consumer goods was largely offset by increased
deliveries of automotive vehicles to Canada and shipments of
industrial supplies. The change in exports in January-February
combined was largely in quantity; the exceptions were exported
industrial supplies and agricultural products, where virtually all
of the rise was in price. By area, higher exports to Japan and Asia
were offset by lower exports to Western Europe and Latin America.

IV-4
Imports of goods and services in January-February were 2
percent higher at an annual rate than in the fourth quarter.
However, this was a somewhat slower rate of increase than in the
past several quarters. This moderate growth is consistent with the
easing of U.S. economic activity experienced during the first
quarter. Increases in imports were recorded in all major trade
categories except oil and computers. By area, imports from Canada
and Western Europe registered the sharpest rise during the first
quarter.
The total quantity of oil imported in January-February was
less (at an annual rate) than in the fourth quarter. While
preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that imports
rose in March with the onset of seasonal inventory accumulation, the
quantity of imports for the full quarter is expected to be somewhat
less than in the fourth quarter. In April, the quantity of oil
imports is estimated to have remained near the first quarter
average.
The price of imported oil rose during the first quarter,
averaging about $16.00 per barrel, $0.60 per barrel higher than the
fourth quarter of last year. In early 1995, the market for lighter-
end products remained tight (given strong Asian demand and
relatively lean U.S. inventories). In addition, towards the end of
March and throughout April, spot oil prices (West Texas
Intermediate) picked-up on increased tension between the United
States and both Iran and Iraq, a relatively tight gasoline market in
the United States, and seasonally lower production in the North Sea.
Currently, spot WTI is trading at $19.93 per barrel, compared with a
first-quarter average of $18.35 per barrel.

Prices of Merchandise Non-oil Imports and Exports
The price of U.S. non-oil imports rose 0.4 percent in March, a
bit less than in February. For the first quarter, the price rose at
a somewhat slower rate than in the previous two quarters. Most of
the increase in the first quarter was in prices of imported
industrial supplies, which were 11 percent higher than a year
earlier. The price of imported food rebounded strongly in March
from the previous month's decline, but was unchanged for the first
quarter as a whole, after having risen 15 percent over the previous
four quarters. Prices of capital goods and automotive imports also
decelerated significantly in the first quarter.
Export prices rose strongly in the first quarter -- the
largest quarterly increase since 1990. This rise largely reflected
increasing prices of industrial supplies and agricultural products.
Export prices in March, having increased for the sixth consecutive
month, increased largely on higher agricultural export prices.
Data for April will be released on May 26.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States increased sharply
in March as foreign governments (particularly Japan) intervened in
foreign exchange markets to counter the slide in the foreign
exchange value of the dollar. For the first quarter as a whole,
foreign official assets in the United States rose by $21.6 billion
(line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).
Intervention continued on a substantial scale in the first half of
April and partial data from the FRBNY indicate large increases in
foreign official assets in the United States in that month as well.
In general, official holdings in the United States of developing
countries in Asia increased in the first quarter while the
experience of Latin American countries was mixed. Particularly
large declines were shown by Argentina.

Private foreigners made very large net purchases of U.S. bonds
in the first quarter (lines 4a and 4b), but sold U.S. stocks net
(line 4c). Purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were particularly
strong, approaching almost as much in the first quarter of 1995 as
in the entire year 1994. Net purchases of U.S. corporate and U.S.
government agency bonds were also strong, as U.S. corporations
borrowed heavily in the Eurobond market. In recent months, new
issues of Eurobonds by U.S. corporations have returned to a more
moderate, but still strong, pace.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) were modest
in the first quarter, far below the pace of recent years. Purchases
of equities from developing countries were negligible. Net bond
purchases were also low. However, foreign issues in the U.S. bond
market picked up in April.
There was a large net capital outflow recorded by banks and
certain brokers and dealers in March (line 3), bringing the net
recorded outflow to almost $18 billion for the first quarter. About
one-fourth of the total outflow for the quarter was accounted for by
RP transactions of brokers and dealers. Both domestic and foreign
chartered banks contributed to the rest of the outflow. As
indicated on line 1 of the International Banking Data table,
outflows from banks to their foreign offices and IBFs also showed up
on a monthly average basis in March and April. These outflows
apparently reflected a shift in funding sources for banks. Rates of
return on domestic bank deposits have been rising relative to
alternative investments attracting larger inflows into core
deposits; banks have also increased their reliance on managed
liabilities other than net borrowing from their own foreign offices.
Net shipments of U.S. currency to foreigners were very large
in the first quarter of 1995, reaching $8.5 billion. Shipments to

Russia remained strong, while shipments to Argentina picked up
sharply.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average dollar has risen 1 percent, on net, since
the March 28 FOMC meeting. The dollar has risen 3 percent against
the German mark, but has declined by similar amounts against the
Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. All of the dollar's gains
against the mark occurred in the past week. The reasons for the
dollar's recent rally were unclear. Market participants may have
come to believe that the dollar's decline earlier this year was
overdone, especially in light of signs that the weak dollar is
having a negative effect on foreign economies and is prompting
easier monetary policy abroad. With the Mexican crisis having been
cited as a negative for the dollar earlier this year, the dollar may
have benefitted recently from the improvement in Mexican economic
conditions over the past two months. In addition, last week's
Congressional proposals to balance the U.S. government budget over
the next seven years may have supported the dollar over the past
week.
During the first three weeks of the intermeeting period, the
dollar continued to decline sharply against the yen, reaching a
record intra-day low just under 80 yen per dollar on April 19, amid
indications that the United States and Japan would not be able to
reach agreement on trade issues. Without a negotiated agreement to
open Japanese markets, market participants apparently believed that
the dollar would have to fall to bring about adjustment in the trade
balance. The strengthening of the yen occurred despite two moves by
the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy. First, on March 31, the
Bank reduced its target for the overnight call money rate by more
than 30 basis points to the 1-3/4 percent level of the official
discount rate. Then, on April 14, the official discount rate was

cut to 1 percent and the call money rate was allowed to decline to
nearly 1 1/4 percent Also largely ineffective were the Bank of
Japan's frequent dollar purchases during the intermeeting period
and U.S. intervention purchases against mark and yen
totalling $2.6 billion on April 3 and 5.
The Bundesbank's surprise easing of key interest rates on
March 30 appeared to have more effect on the foreign exchange
markets. The Bundesbank reduced its discount rate 50 basis points
to 4 percent and reduced the rate on 14-day repurchase agreements 35
basis points to 4-1/2 percent, indicating that the move was prompted
in part by the effect of the strong mark on the domestic economy.
The dollar recovered some ground against the mark that day and
remained relatively steady against the mark from then until the
recent dollar rally.
Within Europe, the mark declined against other currencies
following the Bundesbank's actions but then rose ahead of the second
stage of the French presidential election. Following that election,
the French franc recovered to be about unchanged on net against the
mark since the last FOMC meeting. The Italian lira has gained more
than 5 percent on balance against the mark. Most of that gain came
in May after an agreement between the government and unions over
reforming the pension system. Italian ten-year bond yields have
declined nearly 1-1/2 percentage points since the last FOMC meeting,
much more than yields in any other major country. Italian short-
term interest rates have also eased more than 1 percentage point
Short-term rates have declined nearly as much in Canada and France,
two other countries where exchange rate pressures have eased over
the intermeeting period. On net, weighted-average foreign three-
month interest rates have declined nearly 70 basis points versus a
10 basis point decline in U.S. short-term rates. In contrast, U.S.

IV-13
ten-year interest rates have declined somewhat more than the 50
basis point decline in weighted-average foreign ten-year interest
rates.
The Mexican peso has appreciated nearly 15 percent against the
dollar since the last FOMC meeting, as Mexican financial markets
have stabilized. Mexican stock prices have risen nearly 13 percent
and yields of Mexican Brady bonds (stripped of their collateral)
have fallen 5-1/2 percentage points. There has also been a
significant decline in the interest rates at which Mexican banks are
able to borrow dollars. With banks able to borrow more cheaply
elsewhere, outstanding dollar loans from the Bank of Mexico through
its FOBAPROA window have declined from a peak of nearly $4 billion
in early April to about $2.5 billion on May 16. With those
repayments, and with a somewhat greater willingness of foreigners to
receive tesobono payouts in pesos, the Bank of Mexico has been able
to meet tesobono maturities of $4 billion since the end of March
with only an $800 million decline in dollar reserves (net of
official loans).
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Indicators of economic activity for the major foreign
industrial countries suggest that recovery continued in the first
quarter of 1995, although the pace varied significantly across
countries. In Japan, industrial production bounced back following
the Kobe earthquake, and other indicators suggest tentative signs of
renewed recovery. In Germany, available incoming data are quite
limited, although capacity utilization continued to expand in the
first quarter. Preliminary estimates of first-quarter GDP in the
United Kingdom indicate that growth continued at about the same pace
as in the fourth quarter of last year. Preliminary data are weak in
France and Italy, and growth in Canada appears to have decelerated
from the rapid pace of last year.

IV-14
Consumer price inflation remains low in most foreign
industrial countries, with the exception of Italy. Inflation has
been held in check in part by moderate increases in labor costs,
although recent wage settlements in Germany may put upward pressure
on inflation later this year. There are also indications of
emerging inflationary pressures in the United Kingdom and Canada.
Data through March give little information on the impact of
recent exchange rate movements. In Japan, "J-curve" effects are
likely to increase the nominal trade surplus in dollar terms in the
short term, although provisions of the recent Japanese government
fiscal package should offset some of the increase. In Germany, the
rapid appreciation of the DM from February through April appears to
have affected confidence about the durability of the recovery.
However, since May 10, the dollar has rebounded sharply against the
DM and the yen, which may mitigate some of these effects.
Former prime minister Jacques Chirac was elected president of
France. Chirac promised to address the problem of high French
unemployment. He is expected to introduce a supplemental budget
reducing payroll taxes and increasing employment subsidies.
Individual country notes. In Japan, data for the first quarter
of 1995 are mixed, but appear to point to a slow recovery of growth.
Industrial production fell in January, reflecting the effects of the
Kobe earthquake, but bounced back in February and March as companies
made up the production losses. New car registrations grew strongly
in the first quarter, but fell in April. Housing starts declined
for the third straight quarter. The fall in January machinery
orders, and its subsequent February rebound, may also reflect the
negative effects of the earthquake. The recent stability in the
unemployment rate and the job offers/applicants ratio suggests that
the labor market may have hit bottom.

On May 10, the Japanese government approved a stimulus package
amounting to 1/2 percent of GDP to finance reconstruction of areas
hit by the Kobe earthquake and for programs to help companies cope
with the strong yen. On May 16, the United States announced a 100
percent tariff on luxury cars imported from Japan worth almost $6
billion, after the breakdown of recent trade talks aimed at
deregulating Japan's auto parts market and at opening up Japanese
car dealerships to U.S. auto companies.
Information on recent economic developments in Germany is
limited, as the statistical agencies are in the process of
converting the separate western and eastern accounts to a pan-German
basis. Preliminary all-German retail sales for January and February
showed no change from the previous year and sales in March showed a
sharp decline, consistent with the weakness in spending that had
been expected as a result of the reimposition of the solidarity
income tax surcharge. Very preliminary pan-German industrial
production data (SA, based on new data collection methods) for
January show a 6.9 percent decline from December, partly reflecting
weather-related weakness in construction. However, capacity

utilization in west German manufacturing rose in the first quarter,
suggesting that production continued to expand.

A substantial increase in orders for manufactured goods at the
end of last year is likely to translate into further gains in
production in the short run. However, the recent appreciation of
the DM may have begun to affect the business outlook, as the net
percentage of firms expecting to increase production in the next
three months fell in both February and March along with a sharp drop
in export expectations. Continued stagnation in the west German
labor market, reflected in the persistence of the unemployment rate
(SA) at 8.2 percent in April, also has been attributed in part to
the strength of the DM, as firms reportedly are reluctant to hire
new staff in the face of uncertainty about the durability of the
recovery. The east German unemployment rate (NSA), which was 13.9
percent in April, has stabilized in the last few months following
nearly a year of steady improvement.
The year-over-year CPI inflation rate for western Germany was
2.3 percent in April. Excluding effects of indirect tax increases,
consumer price inflation has shown little change for the past six

IV-17
months, following a significant reduction over the preceding year.
The outlook for further deceleration is uncertain. The DM
appreciation has begun to have a beneficial effect on import and
producer prices. However, wage settlements so far this year have
been significantly higher than previously anticipated, while the DM
recently has retraced much of its earlier appreciation.
Official interest rates were lowered on March 30 for the first
time in nine months. The discount rate was reduced from 4.5 to 4.0
percent, and the repo rate was lowered from 4.85 to 4.5 percent.
The Bundesbank also switched from fixed to variable-rate repurchase
operations in April, although the repo rate since has shown little
change.
In France, recent monthly indicators are weak. Industrial
production fell in February, after rising slightly in January,
largely reflecting movements in energy output. Manufacturing
production rose in February, reversing about half of its January
decline. A business survey by INSEE, the French Statistics
institute, indicated that production changed little in the first
quarter, and data on manufacturing capacity utilization in April
showed little change from January. An April INSEE survey reported
that French businesses intend to increase real investment by 11
percent this year, roughly the same as the intended increase
reported in the January survey. Consumption was also weak, as
consumption of manufactured products (equal to one-third of total
consumption) fell almost one percent in the first quarter.
Consumer prices in April were 1.6 percent above their year-
earlier level, a slightly smaller increase than in previous months.
This good inflation performance in part reflects relatively constant
wage inflation.
On May 7, former prime minister Jacques Chirac was elected
president of France, defeating socialist candidate Lionel Jospin

IV-18
with 52.6 percent of the vote. The high rate of unemployment in
France was the dominant campaign issue and Chirac has committed
himself to new measures to reduce unemployment. The new government

is expected to introduce a supplemental mid-year budget in July that
will cut payroll taxes paid by employers sharply and increase
employment subsidies. These measures probably will be financed by
an increase in the VAT. On the issue of European integration,
President Chirac is committed to achieving European Monetary Union
by 1999, but has said he will call a referendum on reforms to the
institutional structure of the European Union that are expected to
result from the 1996 intergovernmental conference.
In the first quarter, real GDP in the United Kingdom rose a
preliminary 3.1 percent (SAAR), the same as in the fourth quarter
and much stronger than market expectations. (No information about
components was released.) Economic activity increased in the
service sector, while industrial production reportedly was flat.
Good weather also boosted agriculture and construction. Retail
sales were flat on average in the first quarter, but survey data
show a surge in April sales and expectations of strong sales in May.
In April, the unemployment rate fell further to 8.3 percent.
Producer confidence improved considerably in the first quarter but

IV-19
fell somewhat in April. Consumer confidence in the three months to
April was at its lowest level in over two years.
Despite some deceleration in earnings inflation, producer and
retail price inflation has accelerated this year. However,
expectations of price increases in the CBI survey were considerably
smaller in April, after edging down in the previous two months from
the peak in January.

In the Bank of England's quarterly Inflation Report released
May 11, inflation is forecast to rise to the top of the 1 to 4
percent target range in 1996 and to fall to only 3 percent in 1997,
primarily because of the pound's depreciation this year. Because
the government is committed to reducing inflation to 2-1/2 percent
or below by mid-1997, the Report's release reinforced market
speculation that Governor George had advised Chancellor Clarke to
raise official rates at the monetary meeting on May 5. After their
meeting, Clarke surprised the market by announcing that rates would
not be raised this month.
In Italy, monthly indicators are mixed, but on balance suggest
a resumption of GDP growth. ISTAT, the Italian statistics office,
reported that after falling sharply in January, industrial
production rebounded 0.5 percent in February to a level slightly

IV-20
below its fourth-quarter average. The unemployment rate rose
sharply in the first quarter as employment declined in all sectors
of the economy. An industry survey by Confindustria, an
organization of Italian employers, indicated that industrial
production rose 2 percent in April, after declining 0.4 percent in
March.

Indicators of inflation have risen sharply in recent months.
In April, consumer prices were 5.2 percent above their year-earlier
level. Increases in the VAT and excise taxes on gasoline are
expected to increase consumer prices by 0.7 percent this year.
Wholesale and producer price inflation also increased sharply in
both January and February. Signs of inflationary pressure were also
evident in wages. In February, wages were 2.5 percent above their
year-earlier level, a slightly smaller increase than in January but
well above the increase of 1.9 percent registered in December.
On May 8, the Italian government and labor unions announced an
agreement on pension reform. Under the reform, Italy will move
gradually from a system where workers are entitled to a pensions
equal to 70 percent of recent wages after 35 years of work

organization refused to sign the agreement, arguing that the 12-year
transition from the old to the new system is too long. The reform
is expected to reduce the structural budget deficit by roughly 2/3
percentage points of GDP. Prime Minister Dini said he will resign
after parliament passes the reform, which is expected by June 30.
New national elections are expected in November.
Preliminary economic indicators in Canada for the first
quarter suggest that growth has slowed from the very rapid pace of
expansion seen last year. Industrial production declined in
February and manufacturing shipments and new factory orders fell in
both February and March, following four consecutive strong monthly
increases. Retail sales fell in both January and February. A
decline in the labor force participation rate was responsible for
the drop in the unemployment rate in April, while overall employment
has been essentially unchanged since last November. The index of
business confidence registered its first decline in six quarters,
and the index of consumer attitudes fell to its lowest level since
the end of 1993. Consumer price inflation has picked up in recent

cigarette tax cuts rising from 1.6 percent in December to 2.2

Canada's target range.
On May 3, the Bank of Canada released the first issue of the
new semi-annual Monetary Policy Report, which summarizes the Bank's
inflation-control targets and the outlook for inflation. The Report
concludes that although there is some risk that past depreciation of
the Canadian dollar could push core inflation temporarily to the
upper half of the 1 to 3 percent target band in 1995, the longer-
term outlook is consistent with the Bank's objectives. On May 8,
the Bank of Canada lowered the target range for the overnight call
rate by 25 basis points, to a range of 7.5-8 percent. The Bank
previously had raised the call rate target by a total of 300 basis
points since last November.

Data on Japan's trade and current accounts for the first
quarter are now available. Since January, the yen has appreciated
close to 14 percent against the dollar. The first-quarter trade
balance was down slightly from the fourth quarter, and the current
account was about unchanged, suggesting that exchange rate impacts
have yet to be felt. Based on historical experience, we expect the
recent yen appreciation to increase Japan's nominal trade surpluses
in dollar terms until sometime during the first half of next year,
reflecting "J-curve" effects.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Growth in the first quarter of 1995 remained relatively steady
in most major developing countries other than Mexico, where growth
was negative. Export growth in the first quarter of 1995 was strong
in most countries other than Brazil. Import growth varied widely,
however, with high import growth in Brazil, Taiwan, and Korea, and
low or negative growth in Mexico and Argentina. As of May 16, the
prices of par Brady Bonds had risen by nearly a third since the last
Greenbook, and in Argentina and Brazil are now above their levels on
December 19, 1994; Mexican bond prices remain 9 percent below their
December 19 levels.
Mexico ran trade and fiscal surpluses in the first quarter;
the peso has appreciated strongly since late March. Brazil has
responded to a deteriorating external balance by increasing tariffs.
Argentina's trade deficit narrowed considerably in the first four
months of 1995, and the government has established two trust funds
to strengthen confidence in the banking system. Strong growth and
high inflation continue in China, where exports surged in the first
four months of 1995. In Taiwan and Korea, both exports and imports
grew rapidly in the first quarter, as strong growth continues.
Monthly inflation has slowed in Russia in recent months, and
economic activity, though still falling, has been falling more
slowly.
Individual Country Notes. In Mexico, there is growing
evidence that economic activity has declined sharply in recent
months. First-quarter real GDP (n.s.a) declined 0.6 percent from
its year-earlier level and 9.1 percent from its level in the fourth
quarter of 1994. While GDP usually exhibits a seasonal decline in
the first quarter, this year's decline was the sharpest in more than
a decade. The downturn was most pronounced in construction and
textiles manufacturing. Industrial production in February was 1.1

IV-27
percent below its year-earlier level, and was 6.2 percent below its
January level on a seasonally adjusted basis; although January
industrial production had increased 0.9 percent (s.a.) from
December, this rise probably was associated with declining sales and
increased inventory accumulation. The urban unemployment rate
(n.s.a.) rose from 3.2 percent in December to 4.5 percent in January
and 5.3 percent in February, confirming anecdotal evidence of
widespread layoffs.
There was a marked turnaround in Mexico's trade performance in
the first quarter, reflecting both the sharp decline in economic
activity and the marked depreciation of the peso. The merchandise
trade balance registered a $460 million surplus in March following a
$235 million surplus in February (revised downward from a
preliminary estimate of $450 million), leading to a surplus of $165
million for the first quarter. Exports were 33 percent higher in
the first quarter than a year earlier, while imports were virtually
unchanged. Last year, Mexico recorded a $4.3 billion first-quarter
trade deficit.
From its low of more than 7 pesos/dollar in late March, the
peso has appreciated strongly, reaching about 5.9 pesos/dollar on
May 16. Nevertheless, inflationary pressures have remained high.
Consumer prices rose 8 percent in April after increasing 5.9 percent
in March and 4.2 percent in February, in part reflecting an April 1
increase in the value-added tax. After rising more than 5 percent
in the first half of April, however, prices rose only 2.2 percent in
the second half, reinforcing expectations that inflation will
decline in subsequent months.
Preliminary data indicate that in the first quarter, the
fiscal surplus of the non-financial public sector was about 2
percent of GDP. This surplus was well above the targeted 1995
surplus of 0.5 percent announced in the economic adjustment program

IV-28
March 9. The primary (non-interest) surplus was about 7 percent of
GDP, compared with a 1995 target level of 4.4 percent.
Economic policy since the last Greenbook has focused on
further implementing the March 9 program. On March 17, a new
reserve requirement regime was put in place, allowing commercial
banks to hold a zero balance with the Bank of Mexico over a month-
long period rather than on a daily basis. On March 31, trading in
exchange rate futures by selected Mexican banks was authorized;
trading in peso futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began on
April 25. The 5 percentage point rise in the value-added tax
specified in the March 9 program was put into effect on April 1, and
on the same day, the minimum wage was raised by 12 percent, two
percentage points higher than announced on March 9. On April 4, the
Bank of Mexico began publishing the daily index numbers, or UDIs, to
be used to index bank loans, and plans are moving forward on the
development of the restructuring program for loans to small- and
medium-sized borrowers.
In Brazil, aggregate demand continues to be very strong and
inflation has recently risen. Real GDP in the first quarter of 1995
was 9.1 percent higher than its year-earlier level, continuing the
strong growth experienced since the enactment of the exchange-rate-
based stabilization plan in July 1994. Monthly inflation, which has
been 1-2 percent since December 1994, rose to 2.3 percent in April
1995.
Brazil recorded a trade deficit of $0.8 billion in April 1995,
reflecting a 77 percent rise in imports and a 6 percent fall in
exports over the same month last year. The trade deficit was $2.8
billion in the first four months of 1995, compared with a trade
surplus of $4.3 billion in the year-earlier period. In late March
1995, Brazil increased tariffs on over 100 consumer durables from an
average of 12 percent to 70 percent, which represented a partial

IV-29
reversal of the trade liberalization enacted in recent years. In
late April the government raised reserve requirements and tightened
controls in an attempt to reduce credit demand. The real/dollar
exchange rate has been stable in the lower range of the 0.88-0.93
band established in early March. One-month deposit rates, however,
remain relatively high at 60-70 percent per year, and continue to be
volatile. Analysts estimate that international reserves in late
April were $30-$32 billion, down from $39 billion in November 1994.
Brazilian share prices increased by 25 percent between mid-
April and May 16 in response to moves in Brazil's congress towards
removing constitutional restrictions on direct foreign investment in
mining, telecommunications, and other sectors of the economy. (The
Bovespa index, however, was still 23 percent below its pre-Mexican
crisis level.) Although the constitutional amendments still have to
pass a few more hurdles, it is anticipated that the restrictions
will be lifted.
In Argentina, industrial output rose 2.7 percent in the first
quarter of 1995 from a year earlier. Consumer prices rose 4.7
percent in April from a year earlier. Austerity measures, including
a shortage of credit in the economy, have resulted in a rapid
turnaround in Argentina's trade deficit in the last two months. For
the first four months of 1995, the trade deficit shrank to $270
million from $2.4 billion for the same period last year. Exports
rose 47 percent while imports fell 2 percent.
Gross international reserves stood at $13.7 billion as of May
10, of which $2.3 billion are in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds.
The monetary base was $11.8 billion, leaving $1.9 billion in excess
reserves. This compares with reserves of $17.7 billion at the
beginning of 1995, despite a $1.6 billion payment from the IMF in
early April, most of which went to build up reserves. Problems in
the banking sector have led to an $8.3 billion decline in total

IV-30
deposits, of which $4.8 billion were in pesos, since December 20,
1994. Of the $8.3 billion decline in deposits, at least $5.6
billion was covered out of reserves, with the rest "financed" by a
reduction in the domestic credit of the banking system.
In an effort to strengthen confidence in the banking system,
the government has established two separate trust funds, financed by
loans from the World Bank and the IDB, and a deposit guarantee fund,
financed by a $2 billion "Argentine Bond." The World Bank and the
IDB have already approved $725 and $750 million, respectively, from
a total of $1.3 billion each, for provincial financial sector
reforms, privatizing 15 out of the 20 provincial banks and giving
assistance to private banks that are in need of liquidity. The BIS
in late April approved a bridge loan of up to $1 billion to be
repaid out of the World Bank and IDB disbursements. A deposit
guarantee fund was established on April 19 under which deposits up
to 90 days will be guaranteed to a maximum of 10,000 pesos
($10,000), and deposits for more than 90 days will be guaranteed up
to a maximum of 20,000 pesos. The system will be funded by a charge
to banks of 0.03-0.06 percent of their deposits (about $2.5
billion).
Despite these new funds, Argentina's banking troubles remain.
On April 14, the Central Bank temporarily suspended the operations
of six more commercial banks and financial institutions that were
having trouble paying back depositors. About 50 banks and financial
institutions have merged with other banks since late February, but
so far only one bank has actually failed.
On May 14, Argentina re-elected President Menem, from the
Justicialist (Peronist) Party, for a second term. Menem won the
election in the first round with about 50 percent of the vote; the
second-place candidate received about 31 percent of the vote.

In Venezuela, consumer price inflation was 4.1 percent in
April, up from 3.2 percent in March. Total reserves excluding gold
stood at an estimated $7.8 billion on April 14, little changed from
the beginning of 1995. Foreign investment in Venezuela's non-
traditional sectors (that is, sectors other than oil, mineral,
banking, and insurance) was $71 million in the first quarter of
1995, compared with $22 million in the same period last year.
Venezuela registered a trade deficit of $650 million in the first
two months of 1995, with exports rising 34 percent and imports
rising 22 percent.
The government is currently negotiating an anti-inflation pact
with business and labor, in which the government would commit itself
to fiscal and monetary discipline in exchange for a moderation of
wage and price increases on the part of the private sector. It
appears unlikely, however, that this agreement will be signed soon.
The government also announced that it will not privatize its
electric plant complex (Planta Centro) or the remaining shares, 49
percent, of its phone company (CANTV).
Real GDP in China rose 11.2 percent in the first quarter of
1995 from the year-earlier period, after rising 12 percent overall
in 1994. Industrial value-added was up 15 percent in April from the
year-earlier period, after rising 14.4 percent in the first quarter.
Consumer prices at the end of March 1995 were 21.3 percent higher
than a year earlier. Strong export growth led to a trade surplus of
$8.8 billion in the first four months of 1995. Exports rose 53
percent from the year-earlier period, while imports rose 15 percent.
In early May, China's National People's Congress approved a
new commercial bank law, scheduled to take effect July 1. The goal
of the new law is to turn China's major banks into independent,
commercial entities, giving banks the right to refuse to extend
credit to borrowers they consider poor credit risks. In particular,

IV-32
the new law seeks to guarantee that China's major banks are
independent of local or provincial authorities, who often direct
banks to provide credit to favored borrowers. The new law also sets
asset, loan, and liquidity ratios.
In Taiwan, industrial production rose 9.1 percent in the first
quarter of 1995 from the year-earlier period. Consumer prices at
the end of March were 4.4 percent higher than a year earlier. In
the first quarter, Taiwan ran a trade surplus of $1.5 billion, with
exports rising 23 percent and imports rising 18 percent from the
year-earlier period.
Economic activity in Korea continued to expand rapidly during
the first quarter of 1995: output of manufactured goods rose 14
percent from its year-earlier level. Consumer prices in April were
5.1 percent higher than their year-earlier level. Although consumer
price inflation has thus remained moderate, controlling inflation is
a principal concern of Korean policymakers, given both strong growth
in aggregate demand and substantial increases in imported goods
prices in recent months.
Korea's exports in the first quarter of 1995 increased by
about 32 percent (in dollar terms) from their year-earlier level.
However, imports increased by 34 percent over the same period due to
strong domestic demand and rising import prices. This contributed
to a widening of Korea's current account deficit to $3.8 billion in
the first quarter of the year, compared to a deficit of $2.2 billion
in the first quarter last year.
Russian monthly consumer price inflation fell to 8 percent in
April and 9 percent in March, from 18 percent in January and 11
percent in February, due primarily to a tightening of monetary
policy. During the first quarter of 1995, broad money grew by only
1 percent a month, down from 9 percent average monthly growth during
all of 1994. On May 16. the Central Bank reduced its monthly

IV-33
refinance rate slightly, from 16.7 percent to 16.3 percent; given
the recent decline in inflation, however, the real refinance rate
remains strongly positive.
Falling inflation and tighter monetary policy have allowed the
ruble to stabilize. After declining against the dollar by about 10
percent a month during the first quarter of 1995, the ruble fell by
less than 5 percent during April. During the first half of May, the
ruble appreciated against the dollar by 2 percent. On May 17, the
MICEX ruble-dollar exchange rate closed at 5,038.
The rate of decline of economic activity continues to slow.
During the first four months of 1995, real GDP and industrial
production were each about 5 percent below their year-earlier
levels. By contrast, during the first four months of 1994.
industrial production plunged 25 percent and real GDP declined 17
percent from a year earlier.
On April 11, the IMF Executive Board approved a $6.8 billion
equivalent stand-by arrangement for Russia, with an initial
disbursement of about $1.1 billion. The agreement calls for the
1995 budget deficit to fall to about 6 percent of GDP, down from 10
percent of GDP in 1994, and for inflation to average 1 percent a
month during the second half of the year.
