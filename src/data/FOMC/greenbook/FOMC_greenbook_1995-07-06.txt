DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity will likely decline a bit this quarter,
primarily reflecting a slowing in homebuilding and an inventory
correction centered in the motor vehicle industry. Consumer
spending has remained sluggish, and growth in business fixed
investment appears to be moderating from the very rapid pace of
recent quarters. There are indications that consumer and producer
price inflation may be slowing, after picking up earlier this year.
Labor Market Developments
Recent data indicate a substantial weakening in labor
demand. Most notably, nonfarm payroll employment fell 101,000 in
May, after posting a slight decline in April. As noted in the
last Greenbook, the Board staff and the BLS believe that the April
data were depressed somewhat by seasonal adjustment problems
associated with the timing of the survey week. However, even
adjusting for this problem, employment gains in April were small.
And, while we are skeptical that the May decline in payrolls is a
good representation of trends in the labor market, apart from some
minor weather-related disruptions in construction, we can identify
no major special factors affecting the data for that month.
The deterioration in the labor market has been especially
marked in the goods-producing sector. Manufacturing payrolls
dropped 81,000 over the past two months; employment in nearly every
major industrial category declined, on net, over the April-May
period. In addition, the factory workweek fell from an average of
1. The BLS also revised previous data to reflect the 1994
benchmark to unemployment insurance tax records (ES-202 program).
These revisions raised the level of nonfarm employment by 789,000 in
March 1994 (the benchmark month). At the same time, however, BLS
lowered their estimates of employment growth by roughly 25,000 per
month after March 1994 to reflect more recent information available
from the ES-202 program. As a result, the level of employment was
486,000 higher as of February 1995.

42.1 hours per week in the first quarter to 41.5 hours per week in
April and May. Most of this decline appears to reflect reductions
in the use of overtime hours, which fell from 4.8 hours in the first
quarter to 4.3 hours in May. Employment also declined in the
construction industry in April and May. The BLS indicated that some
of the dropback in construction jobs can be attributed to heavy
rains and floods in the South during the May survey week.
In the service-producing sector, overall employment has
continued to rise in recent months, but the pace of hiring has
slowed. In the services industry, payrolls rose by an average of
47,000 in April and May, well below the average pace of growth
during the first quarter. Business services posted no gain over the
latest two months, as a downturn in employment at temporary help
agencies offset small gains elsewhere; meanwhile, net hiring in the
health care industry slowed to about half its first-quarter pace.
Employment in wholesale and retail trade was unchanged, on balance,
in April and May, while the number of jobs in finance, insurance,
and real estate fell.2
The combination of the decline in employment and a shortening
of the average workweek in most sectors left the level of aggregate
hours of production or nonsupervisory workers thus far this quarter
1 percent below the first-quarter average. Even if June shows a
sizable increase in aggregate hours, as seems likely, aggregate
2. The federally funded summer jobs program, which was targeted
for cuts in the House version of the rescissions bill earlier this
year, appears to be proceeding normally. The final version of the
rescissions package, which contained cuts in summer jobs only for
future years, was vetoed by President Clinton. As a result, we
expect the program to fund about 600,000 youth jobs this summer,
about the same as in 1994.

hours for the second quarter as a whole will probably show a
decline.
Data from the household survey also indicate a weakening in
labor demand. The unusually sharp declines in household employment
in April and May--which totaled nearly 1 million--most likely
reflect seasonal adjustment problems associated with the timing of
survey weeks and the end of the school year. Such problems often
afflict the household data at this time of year, and we would not be
surprised to see at least a partial offset in the June or July
4data. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate--which is less
affected by these timing issues--has moved up in recent months, to
around 5-3/4 percent. Increased joblessness among teenagers has
accounted for part of the rise in the overall unemployment rate.
However, jobless rates for adult men and adult women also have
increased.
Other labor market data also suggest that growth in labor
demand has slowed, but the weakness implied by these series is not
so profound as the drop in the employment numbers would suggest.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved up in recent
weeks to the 400,000 range, but even that level of claims has
historically been consistent with no change or a small increase in
payroll employment rather than an outright decline. Moreover, the
decline in the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising--
about 5 index points from its peak in December--left the series in
April at a level about equal to that in the second half of last
3. Payroll employment in June may be artificially boosted by the
same type of seasonal adjustment problem that depressed the April
data. Because the May and June survey periods were separated by
five weeks this year instead of the usual four, the reported June
employment change could be elevated by about 100,000 jobs.
4. The difficulty is caused by the large numbers of seasonal
workers who enter the labor force following the end of the school
year. This year, the May survey week was early in the month, and it
is likely that many college students were still in school, leading
to underestimates of both employment and the labor force.

year. Similarly, the most recent reading from the Manpower index of
net hiring strength--which refers to employers' hiring plans in the
third quarter--showed a decline that about offset the increases
posted in the previous two quarters. Finally, the Bureau of
National Affairs' survey of personnel executives indicated that
employers continued to have some difficulty in the second quarter in
filling production/service and technical/professional jobs; however,
the survey also reported that fewer employers are planning workforce
expansions in the third quarter than in recent quarters.
Despite the generally negative tone of the recent labor market
indicators, workers have remained relatively upbeat about job
prospects. The Conference Board's June indexes on current job
availability indicated that roughly a quarter of the respondents
believed that jobs were hard to get, a bit greater than the fraction
reporting that jobs were plentiful. Although the balance
deteriorated slightly from readings earlier this year, those
readings had been the most favorable since 1990. With regard to
future job prospects, recent readings from both the Conference
Board's employment expectations index and the Michigan Survey's
index of unemployment expectations have generally held in the
range seen over the past couple of years.
Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 2.7 percent
in the first quarter, bringing the growth in labor productivity over
the past year to 2.0 percent. Part of the recent surge in
productivity--which seems somewhat surprising in light of the
deceleration in GDP--results from the fact that the income-based

measure of output used by BLS to calculate productivity has been
rising faster than the product-based measure.
Industrial Production
Industrial production slid another 0.2 percent in May and has
declined nearly 1.0 percent from its peak in February. Weekly
production data received so far in June (covering about 17 percent
of total IP) indicate further weakening in IP this month.
Manufacturing output registered its fourth consecutive decline in
May as the production of motor vehicles and parts moved down sharply
and production in most other industries remained sluggish. The
factory operating rate fell to 83.0 percent in May, 2.2 percentage
points below its beginning-of-year high but still 1.7 percentage
points above the 1967-94 average.

The output of motor vehicles and parts dropped 8.0 percent from
March to May, directly accounting for about one-half of the decline
in total IP over that two-month period; perhaps another quarter of
5. This divergence is reflected as a sharp decline in the value
of the statistical discrepancy in the national income and product
accounts--from $25.5 billion in the first quarter of 1993 to
-$60.4 billion in the first quarter of 1995. BLS plans to convert
its productivity series to a product-side concept (by adding the
statistical discrepancy) in late 1995 or early 1996.

the decline can be traced to indirect effects of motor vehicle
production on related industries. Though the makers' schedules call
for some increase in motor vehicle assemblies in June, the weekly
output data suggest that production in June will remain roughly
unchanged at May levels.
Industrial production excluding motor vehicles and parts was
essentially unchanged in May, after declining 0.3 percent in April.
Production of consumer goods fell 0.2 percent in May as an increase
in the production of nondurables, such as chemical and paper
products, offset some of the auto-related decline in the production
of durables. Output of other durable consumer goods, which sank
4.5 percent between January and April, edged down another
0.2 percent in May. Production of construction supplies fell
0.6 percent in May, for a total drop of 3.4 percent since January.
Production of business equipment edged up a bit in May after falling
0.2 percent in April.
Downturns in IP of the dimension recently experienced have
often occurred in the midst of continuing expansions; but, of
course, they have also been the early phase of a recession or a
precursor of a near-term cyclical downswing. The historical
relationship between declines in manufacturing output and recessions
suggests that, given the 1.2 percent reduction in manufacturing IP
between January and May, there is a roughly 44 percent chance that
the economy will be in recession as of November (table).6
6. The table groups months from January 1947 to June 1994 by the
magnitude of the percent change in manufacturing output over the
preceding four-month period. In order to examine the relationship
between output declines and the probability of entering a recession,
the analysis excludes output changes that occur in the midst of a
recession. Recession months are defined as months on or after a
business cycle peak and on or before the subsequent business cycle
trough. Peaks and troughs are dated by the National Bureau of
Economic Research.

Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles rebounded in May to a 14.8 million
unit annual rate from the 13.3 million unit rate in April (FRB
seasonals). Sales of foreign autos spurted to 2.1 million units at
an annual rate.
Last month's increase in sales of domestic vehicles reflects,
at least in part, the broadening and deepening of incentives that
were introduced earlier in response to the weaker-than-expected
first-quarter demand. Even with the increase in incentives, sales
plunged in April, and despite the rebound in May, purchases so far
this quarter are running well below the pace of the first quarter.
Much of this decline reflects weakness in sales to consumers
(including leases). Fleet sales in April were also low, with most
of the decrease attributable to a planned shift in the timing of
sales from April to December of last year; in May, fleet sales
returned to more normal levels. (Information on retail and fleet
sales is based on confidential data from industry sources.)
Consumption and Personal Income
The data received since the last Greenbook indicate that real
consumer spending has remained sluggish. Nominal retail sales
increased only 0.2 percent in May, to a level essentially unchanged
from the first-quarter average. Retail sales have been held back
this quarter by a contraction in spending at building material
stores and by the April dip in sales at automotive dealers. In the
retail control category, nominal spending grew 0.4 percent in May.
Among the components of retail control, sales of apparel and
furniture and appliances revived a bit in May after persistent
weakness in both categories for much of 1995. The retail sales
data, in combination with the latest reports on consumer prices and
on unit sales of motor vehicles, suggest that real spending for

goods has been essentially constant since the fourth quarter of last
year.
This slowdown in consumption growth has occurred in an
environment of weakening income growth. After growing at an average
monthly rate of 0.6 percent (annual rate of 7.5 percent) in the
fourth quarter of 1994, real disposable income decelerated to an
average monthly increase of 0.4 percent in the first quarter of
1995. In April, real DPI fell 1.1 percent. Although private wages
and salaries grew moderately in April, DPI was depressed by a $50
billion increase in personal taxes--reflecting the second
installment of the OBRA-93 tax increase on high-income households.
Even though the level of personal taxes fell back in May, hours
worked and average hourly earnings declined, so real DPI likely
remained weak.
Recent readings on consumer sentiment have been mixed.
According to the preliminary estimate, the University of Michigan
SRC index rose slightly in June. Although down somewhat from the
peak in January 1995, recent monthly readings on this index have
remained well within the range that has prevailed since early 1994.
In contrast, the Conference Board index moved down substantially in
June to a level distinctly below the buoyant readings that had
prevailed since late last year. Despite the slippage over the first
half of 1995, both sentiment indexes remain at levels that have been
consistent in the past with moderate consumption growth.
Furthermore, both of the unemployment expectations indexes, which
are more highly correlated with spending than are the overall
indexes, also have remained in a relatively favorable range.
The overall financial condition of households remains good, but
some small signs of financial stress may be emerging. Delinquency
rates for both mortgages and most other consumer loans remain low,

but auto-loan and credit-card delinquency rates rose in the first
quarter of 1995. Debt service payments are also rising relative
to income, although again from very low levels. There is no
evidence, however, that banks have started to restrict credit or
that consumers have reduced their credit demand. Responses to the
Michigan survey, for example, show that consumers are still quite
willing to use savings or credit to finance big-ticket purchases.
In addition, the recent stock market rally has added several hundred
billion dollars to the net worth of households, although the effects
of this addition to wealth on consumption are likely to be spread
over a considerable period of time.
Housing Markets
Housing starts edged down in May. In the single-family segment
of the market, starts fell 4 percent, although permit issuance was
somewhat stronger. Flooding in some areas of the country may have
been a factor in the weakness of starts.
Sales of new homes remained soft through April. Sales of
existing homes, most of which are recorded a month or two after a
contract has been signed, bounced back in May, but only to their
relatively low first-quarter pace. Selling prices of new and
existing homes have been subdued in their latest readings. But
these monthly statistics are fairly noisy indicators and likely have
been depressed by shifts in the mix of sales, as suggested by the
continued increases in the constant-quality price indexes.
More recent surveys, available through early June, suggest that
improvement in starts and sales may be at hand. The recent decline
7. Recent data give a mixed picture of the extent of the
delinquency problem. Data from the American Bankers Association
show a steep rise in credit-card delinquencies, but data from the
Call Report registered only a small increase in the first quarter.
Similarly, delinquencies on auto loans at the captive auto finance
companies rose in the first quarter, while those at banks continued
to trend down.

in interest rates has buoyed consumer homebuying attitudes and
reduced the cash-flow burden of homeownership (based on fixed-rate
mortgages) to near the twenty-five-year low set late in 1993.
Builders rate their current sales more positively than they did
earlier in the spring, and mortgage loan applications appear to be
up.
If housing demand is firming, the response of builders may be
tempered to a degree by the substantial inventory of unsold new
homes. At the end of April, the stock of unsold units was at a
five-year high, having trended up both absolutely and relative to
sales for more than two years. During this period the speculative
share of all single-family starts rose considerably from its record
low at the beginning of 1993, as builders and their lenders became
more willing to initiate projects prior to having a customer under
contract. In the second half of last year, even as demand (measured
by nonspeculative starts) was softening, builders were still
increasing their speculative construction, contributing to the
overhang of unsold new homes.
Multifamily starts rose in May to their highest monthly pace
since January. The increase is consistent with the level of permit
issuance in recent months and with various indicators of gradual
firming in this long-depressed segment of the housing market.
Business Fixed Investment
The available monthly indicators suggest that equipment
investment advanced at a brisk pace in the second quarter, although
growth has moderated from the still more rapid clip of the previous
year or so. Spending for nonresidential structures appears to be
headed for another large gain in the second quarter, consistent with
an improvement in market fundamentals in this sector.

II-25
Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft--an
important indicator of near-term equipment spending--increased
2.5 percent in May, more than retracing the April decline. The
average level of these shipments during the first two months of the
quarter was 2-1/4 percent above the first-quarter average; in
contrast, during the previous four quarters, these shipments
advanced at an average quarterly pace of 4-1/2 percent. New orders
for these goods rose 4.1 percent in May, after a 5-1/2 percent
decline in April. Cutting through the monthly ups and downs, these
orders have continued to increase in recent months, but at a more
moderate pace than in 1994.
Computer shipments have been especially robust in recent
months. The level of shipments in May was 13-1/2 percent higher
than the average reading in the fourth quarter of last year. This
strength would seem to defy anecdotal reports that computer
shipments have been crimped in recent months by shortages of parts
and peripherals.
Overall, the fundamentals for investment are consistent with a
moderation in equipment spending later this year. The accelerator
effect, which econometric relations suggest is best captured by long
lags of changes in business output--with a mean lag of seven
quarters--has been waning gradually during the past couple of years,
and in the first quarter of this year was about neutral for
investment. After large increases early in 1994, the underlying
trend in real cash flow has moderated since last fall. The cost of
capital for equipment was boosted last year by the rise in interest
rates, and, given the estimated lag relationships, that increase
8. While the list of items reported to be on short supply is
fairly long (memory chips, CD-ROM drives, monitors, and hard disk
drives), industry contacts have indicated that these are mainly spot
shortages of the sorts that have nagged most major producers at one
time or another during the past couple of years.

should exert its greatest effect on PDE during the first half of
this year. Looking ahead, the rallies in the stock and bond markets
so far this year have lowered the cost of capital; all else equal,
this should have a positive influence on spending later this year
and early in 1996.
Outlays for nonresidential structures have been on a solid
uptrend since the spring of 1994. Spending for these structures
advanced at a 14-1/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
reflecting widespread gains among the various components. Monthly
data on construction put-in-place through April point to another
healthy increase early in the second quarter. Permits for
nonresidential structures, which tend to lead construction by a few
months, still are trending up, especially sharply in the industrial
sector.
Indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential
construction sector have continued to improve. According to CB
Commercial, vacancy rates for office buildings declined to
15.1 percent in the first quarter, down 1-3/4 percentage points from
a year earlier. Downtown markets have seen a dramatic improvement
during the past couple of years, although the first-quarter vacancy
reading, 15.6 percent, still is a few percentage points above the
typical estimate of equilibrium. While the growth of construction
spending has been quite rapid, the level of activity is still
extremely low. For example, only 1.9 million square feet of
completed office space were added to markets in the first quarter,
and much of this space was pre-leased or build-to-suit for a
corporate owner. This is up from the pace in 1993 and 1994, when
new supply averaged about 1 million square feet each quarter, but
in 1985, the peak year for new supply, 131.5 million square feet
were completed, and most of this space was not pre-leased. In the

industrial sector the vacancy rate declined to 7.3 percent in the
first quarter, down 1/2 percentage point from a year earlier and
1-3/4 percentage points below its peak in mid 1992.
The National Real Estate Index, which is based on transactions
prices for commercial properties, has also improved markedly during
the past year or so. Office prices, which fell the furthest earlier
in the 1990s, have turned around most abruptly. Prices for
warehouses and for other commercial properties also have rebounded.
Inventories
After a significant buildup in the first quarter, business
inventories continued to expand at a fairly brisk pace in April.
Although the information in hand suggests that serious inventory
imbalances exist in only a few sectors, surveys indicate that
businesses are watching their stock levels very closely and are
poised to adjust orders and production if demand weakens further.
Other than motor vehicle inventories, no data are yet available on
stockbuilding in May and June, but there are a few hints that the
pace of inventory investment may have slowed. Industrial production
declined further in May--with part of the weakness stemming from
production adjustments in sectors with excessive stocks. In
addition, the growth in shorter-term business credit--particularly
C&I loans and commercial paper--which often is used to finance
inventories, slowed in May and turned negative in early June; this
could, however, reflect debt restructuring, as bond issuance is up
sharply.
For all manufacturing and trade, the book value of inventories
rose at an annual rate of $90 billion in April--down from the $105
billion accumulation in the first quarter. Excluding motor
vehicles, stocks were up at a $72 billion annual rate in April--
about the same rate as in February and March but well below the

blistering pace of $97 billion in January. As a result of these
increases, stock-to-sales ratios in manufacturing and trade
(excluding motor vehicles) moved up to the high end of the recent
range.
In manufacturing, inventories rose at a $35 billion annual rate
in April--somewhat above the pace in March. Stocks held by
producers of materials and supplies have continued to rise despite
the cutbacks in production. Among industries producing finished
goods, the picture is mixed. Although stocks rose further in
industries producing capital goods--particularly manufacturers of
computing and telecommunications equipment--demand for these
products appears to have held up through the spring. In contrast,
the buildup in inventories of apparel and goods for the home has
taken place in the context of weakness in sales, and inventories now
seem high in these areas.
In wholesale trade, stocks rose at a $35 billion annual pace in
April--matching the gain in the first quarter. Stocks of motor
vehicles continued to build, likely reflecting an uptick in imported
vehicles. Significant stock accumulations also occurred outside of
autos, and the inventory-sales ratio in this segment jumped to the
highest level in four years. The accumulation of stocks was
greatest among distributors of machinery, other durable goods, and
apparel. Import penetration ratios are high for these goods as
well, suggesting that some of the adjustment in production will
occur abroad.
Inventory investment was more moderate at retail
establishments. Outside of auto dealers, retail trade inventories
rose $9 billion in April, and inventory-to-sales ratios generally
seem to be in line with the current pace of sales. The notable
exceptions are in stocks of apparel, where retailers have

II-37
consistently been surprised this year by the dearth of demand, and
in inventories of furniture, appliances, and home furnishings.
Federal Sector
The federal government recorded a budget surplus, on a unified
basis, of $11 billion in April and May, compared with a $15 billion
deficit a year ago. However, after adjusting for differences in the
timing of some payroll and benefits payments and excluding deposit
insurance, the April-May deficit improvement from last year was $16
billion; adjusted outlays were up 6-1/4 percent and receipts were up
14 percent.
Personal nonwithheld taxes in April and May were up 41 percent
($22 billion) from last year. These payments were boosted this year
by a change in "safe-harbor provisions" that allowed some high-
income individuals to delay a larger share of payments on 1994
10liability to the April 17 due date for final payments. It is
likely that this tax law change accounted for most, if not all, of
the growth in personal nonwithheld taxes.1
9. Because April 1 fell on a Saturday, some outlays for defense
payroll, veterans benefits, and supplemental security income
benefits were accelerated into March. No such payment shift
occurred last April.
10. Under current law, taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI)
in 1993 of less than $150,000 can avoid IRS penalties for late
payments of 1994 taxes if payments in 1994 (including the estimated
payment in January 1995) were at least as great as the lesser of
90 percent of 1994's tax liability or 100 percent of 1993's tax
liability (the so-called "previous year's safe harbor"). For
higher-income taxpayers, the previous year's safe harbor is
110 percent of their 1993 tax liability. These provisions are
looser than the law that applied to estimated and final payments on
1993 liabilities. Under that law, taxpayers were denied the option
of the previous year's safe harbor if their AGI was greater than
$75,000, or had jumped more than $40,000, or if they had paid
estimated taxes or penalties for underpayment of estimated taxes in
any of the previous three years.
11. There has been some speculation in the press that lower
mortgage interest deductions, derived from 1993 mortgage
refinancing, led to the jump in April and May tax payments.
However, as of May, cumulative 1994 individual income tax payments
were not unexpectedly high, given income growth and estimates of the
incremental liabilities legislated in OBRA-93. Similarly, refunds
were not unexpectedly low.

II-39
Payments of individual refunds and the EITC (scored as an
outlay) were up 21 percent in April and May, owing in part to
increased IRS scrutiny that delayed payments ordinarily made during
the first quarter. After adjusting for timing effects, about
$9 billion of refund/EITC payments were shifted into the second
quarter.12 Much of the payment shift was from February (down
about $6 billion) to May (up about $6 billion), especially the last
week of May (up about $4 billion).
For the first eight months of the fiscal year, the deficit was
$133 billion, $32 billion less than last year. Excluding deposit
insurance, and adjusting for timing shifts, the deficit reduction
this year was $18 billion, very close to the deficit improvement for
April and May alone. Adjusted outlays excluding deposit insurance
rose at a 5-1/4 percent pace, as rapid growth in spending for net
interest (15 percent) and health programs (9 percent) was offset by
modest growth for adjusted income security spending (2-1/2 percent)
and negative growth for payday-adjusted defense spending
(-3-1/2 percent). Over the first eight months of the fiscal year,
receipts grew at an 8-1/2 percent pace, with all major categories
contributing strongly.
A House-Senate conference committee has agreed on a seven-year
budget resolution that projects budget balance in fiscal 2002.
Relative to CBO's April baseline, the agreement cuts spending $1271
billion and decreases taxes $245 billion. About 50 percent of the
spending reductions are for mandatory programs, primarily Medicare
(21 percent of reductions) and Medicaid (14 percent). In addition,
the plan calls for a $441 billion decrease in discretionary
spending. The agreement includes procedural rules designed to
12. Refund/EITC payments are bunched on Fridays, and the last
Friday of the first quarter fell on March 31; payments made on the
corresponding Friday of last year fell on April 1 and were included
in the second-quarter numbers.

ensure that the spending targets are met before any tax cuts are
enacted. Tax cuts are limited to $245 billion over seven years and
$50 billion in fiscal 2002, and are paid for by an assumed $170
billion fiscal dividend derived from lower interest rates and $75
billion in additional budget cuts to be agreed upon later.
The conference agreement calls for far more deficit reduction
than does the ten-year budget balance plan released by the President
on June 13. The President's plan reaches balance in fiscal 2005
only under economic and technical assumptions that are more
optimistic than the CBO assumptions used in the conference
agreement. Using CBO's assumptions, the policies in the President's
plan would keep the deficit close to $200 billion over the next ten
years.
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of state and local government spending so far in the
second quarter have been mixed, with employment basically flat over
the first two months of the quarter and construction up in April.
Employment fell 16,000 in May, reversing most of the April increase.
All of the May weakness was in employment of noneducation workers.
Real construction spending rose 1 percent at a monthly rate in
April, about twice the monthly average during the first quarter.
Construction of schools and other buildings (the category that
includes prisons) registered strong gains.
State governments are currently finalizing their fiscal 1996
budgets, if they haven't done so already, as the new fiscal year for
all but four states starts July 1. Most states should end the
current year in relatively good shape financially. At the start of
the fiscal year, the states as a group were assuming that general
fund revenue would increase 3.8 percent over the year. For the
first three quarters of the fiscal year, the level of receipts from

II-43
taxes and fees for all state and local governments had already risen
4.0 percent. Even so, with tax revenue in recent months coming in
below expectations in some states and concern mounting about
potential, but as yet unknown, federal reductions in grants, many
state legislatures have been reluctant to pass the generous tax-cut
measures requested by their governors earlier in the year. Indeed,
gubernatorial tax cuts have been rejected, or are likely to be, in
seven states this year: California, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
Nebraska, Oklahoma, Virginia, and Vermont. And, although seventeen
states have cut taxes this year, with several more likely to do so,
these tax cuts have tended to be smaller than first proposed.
Generally, states cutting taxes this year are states with relatively
strong economies, with Republican governors, or with tax hikes
earlier in the decade.
While states, which account for about half of the sector's
spending, have been reporting improved fiscal conditions this year,
many local governments are still struggling financially. After
considerable improvement in 1993 and 1994, more than half of cities
are estimating that they will run current-year deficits in their
general fund accounts in fiscal 1995. In addition, school districts
have been in deficit since the school-year ending in 1990, after
running surpluses during the mid-to-late 1980s; the reported
deficits reflect imbalances in operating accounts as well as a step-
up in school construction early in the 1990s. And, in a recent
survey, nearly 65 percent of counties said they were either having
difficulty maintaining services or were reducing discretionary
programs; 4 percent characterized their fiscal position as in a
crisis. Cities, school districts, and counties make up the bulk of
local governments.

Wages and Prices
Wage inflation has remained in check to date. Average hourly
compensation in the nonfarm business sector accelerated to a
4.3 percent rate of increase in the first quarter, but in large part
this pickup reflected developments that are likely to be reversed in
13the second quarter. Over the twelve months ended in March,
this measure rose 3 percent, about 1/2 percentage point more than
14the change over the previous year. More recent data on average
hourly earnings showed a 0.5 percent increase in April, followed by
a 0.2 percent decline in May. This measure of wage change has risen
2.7 percent over the past twelve months, 0.2 percentage point more
than during the comparable period of a year ago.
Price inflation abated in the most recent data, after an
uptick in early 1995. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices
increased 0.2 percent in May--as compared with the roughly
0.4 percent average pace in the first four months of the year. Over
the past twelve months, the core CPI has increased 3.1 percent--
0.3 percentage point more than in the preceding year. Prices for
finished producer goods excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent
in May, about the same as in the previous month. However, price
increases for producer goods at earlier stages of production slowed
considerably. Prices for industrial commodities have been mixed,
and most commodity price indexes continue to show only modest
increases or slight declines in prices for industrial materials.
Prices for consumer commodities excluding food and energy were
flat in May. Apparel prices fell 0.3 percent, probably reflecting
13. In particular, the first-quarter increase was boosted by an
increase in overtime hours, mix-shifts toward higher-wage
industries, a lump-sum payment by GM to its pension plan, and the
increase in the wage ceiling for social security taxes.
14. The employment cost index for private industry workers showed
an almost identical change in hourly compensation--2.9 percent- over
this same period.

larger inventories of clothing and weaker demand. New car prices
rose only slightly in May, and prices for used cars fell
0.7 percent, the first monthly decline in over three years. The CPI
for services other than energy rose 0.3 percent in May, somewhat
less than in the last two months. Automobile finance charges
decreased 1.3 percent, the first decline since 1993, indicating that
earlier interest rate hikes are now fully reflected in consumer
charges.15 Airfares rose a modest 0.4 percent in May, slowing
substantially from their pace over the last three months. Owners'
equivalent rent and tenants' rent increased 0.4 percent and
0.3 percent, respectively.
The CPI for food was about flat in May. Vegetable prices fell
sharply, after rising in April owing to the California floods.
However, much of that decline was offset by increases in prices for
fresh fruits. Prices for food excluding fruits and vegetables were
little changed in May, held back by declines in prices for beef,
pork and poultry.
Energy prices rose 0.5 percent in May, largely owing to a
2.0 percent increase in gasoline prices at the pump. This increase
in gas prices reflected the pass-through of crude oil costs earlier
in the year and some supply bottlenecks stemming from the
introduction of reformulated gasoline in some parts of the country.
Natural gas prices fell sharply as stocks have been high in the wake
of a mild winter.
Prices at earlier stages of processing point to some easing of
inflationary pressures over the next few months. The PPI for
intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent in
May, sharply lower than the 0.7 percent average monthly pace in the
15. Finance costs have risen 26 percent in the last twelve months,
adding 0.2 percentage points to the twelve-month change in core
inflation.

preceding twelve months, and prices for industrial commodities have
risen modestly since the last Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce
Industrial price index has increased 1.2 percent. Prices for steel
scrap have slipped slightly, reversing their mild uptick in the last
Greenbook. Aluminum prices seem to have stabilized at levels about
ten percent below their late-1994 highs, as aluminum supply has
increased recently. Demand for aluminum has also eased, due to the
slowdown in economic activity and some substitution away from
aluminum by can manufacturers. On the other hand, copper prices
have surged in recent weeks, and are about 13 percent higher than at
the time of the last Greenbook, as copper traders appear to be
nervous about short-run supplies. Stocks of copper in London
Mercantile Exchange warehouses have been dropping rapidly and now
stand at only a four weeks' supply. The Chinese reportedly are
taking advantage of the price surge to sell off their strategic
copper reserve: Chinese exports of copper rose 200 percent in the
first quarter.
Agricultural Conditions
Prices for agricultural commodities have been volatile in the
weeks since the last Greenbook, reflecting weather-related
uncertainty. Both cash and futures prices for corn, wheat, and
soybeans have risen since the last Greenbook, and it looks like
harvest prices will be significantly higher than last year's levels.
Prices for cotton in the cash market have fluctuated widely, as
traders are concerned about short-run supply problems before the
harvest of the U.S. crop; futures markets for cotton have been about
steady since the last Greenbook. Prices for livestock, both cattle
and hogs, have firmed modestly, but are likely to show little
increase over the next six months, except for seasonal fluctuations.

The Agriculture Department's estimates of crop production for
1995 indicate much lower supplies of corn and wheat, as planting
delays earlier in the year led to a downward revision in production
estimates for both crops. The real value of output from the twelve
major crops is now projected to decline about 11 percent. If these
projections were to turn out to be accurate, stocks at the end of
1995 would be much lower than the average in recent years,
indicating higher prices for these commodities. Projections of
cotton production, on the other hand, indicate about a 7 percent
rise in 1995. While output of crops will be lower this year, higher
prices will offset some of the loss to farmers.

II-55
Recession Probabilities
The latest readings on recession probability measures based on
indexes of leading economic indicators are mixed. The measure based
on the Commerce Department's April index of leading economic
indicators (LEI) puts the probability of a recession starting during
the April-September period at 48 percent. Based on the available
data for May, the staff expects the LEI to fall about 0.2 percent
and the probability of recession (over the May-October period) to
rise to 54 percent.
In contrast, the April reading on the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER) measure, which gives a heavier weight to
financial variables, put the probability of recession at only
4 percent.
As may be seen in the charts, these leading indicator measures
have been far from infallible. At this point, they certainly don't
provide any clear reading on whether the recent weakness in the
economy is the beginning of a downturn of recession proportions or
just another of the brief pauses that have occurred in the midst of
previous expansions.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Market interest rates have declined substantially in recent
weeks on evidence of economic weakness and hints in remarks by
System officials that an easing of monetary policy might be at hand.
On balance, Treasury yields moved down 30 to 40 basis points since
the May 23 FOMC meeting, with the largest declines at intermediate
maturities. Declines in private-market interest rates have been
slightly smaller than those on Treasuries. But if that relative
movement reflected concern about the financial strength of firms in
a softer economy, such sentiment did not seem to weigh heavily on
the equity markets: Major stock market indexes have posted gains of
about 2-1/2 percent during the intermeeting period, with most
setting all-time highs.
Credit demands of the federal and state and local governments
have slackened in the second quarter, but borrowing by the private
sector has remained strong. Nonfinancial businesses jumped back
into the bond market in May and June and lifted gross issuance to
the highest volume in more than a year. Business borrowing from
banks was also brisk early in the period, but appears to have
tapered off in the past several weeks, and commercial paper has
contracted since early May. The shift toward bond issuance has
lessened demands on banks and the paper market, but the back-off in
shorter-term credit could also be signalling a reduction in
financing for inventory investment. In the household sector, data
beyond April are scant, but it is likely that overall borrowing has
remained moderate in the second quarter.
M2 and M3 accelerated in May and appear to be expanding at
double-digit rates in June. The former has moved to the upper
portion of its annual range, while the latter has climbed further

above the upper bound of its growth cone. In contrast, narrow
monetary measures, such as total reserves and M1, have remained
weak, though that pattern has been exaggerated to a degree by the
spread of sweep facilities.
Rate Expectations and Yield Curves
Just prior to the May 23 FOMC meeting, quotes on futures
contracts for shorter-term interest rates were essentially flat over
both intermediate and near-term periods; with due allowance for term
premia, this pattern suggested an expectation that policy might ease
by the fall. At present, futures prices anticipate a substantial
easing by that time.
The flattening of the yield curve beyond the near term has been
substantial. Indeed, at times of late an investor had to go to
maturities beyond seven years to find a Treasury yield above the
6 percent intended federal funds rate. Nonetheless, the spread of
the thirty-year bond rate over the three-month bill rate (chart) is
still around 115 basis points. This spread is a good deal wider
than is typical before an economic recession. In the average
experience around the peaks of the seven business cycles since 1955,
the yield curve generally began to flatten as much as one year prior
to the onset of recession, and the spread moved distinctly into
negative territory well before the economic peak (chart). Moreover,
the inversion of the yield curve observed before recessions
generally occurred because long-term rates rose by less than
short-term rates, whereas the flattening that has occurred since
early this year has come from a rally at the long end of the market.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
M2 grew at an annual rate above 5 percent in May and appears to
have strengthened further to an 11 percent pace in June, placing the
aggregate above the midpoint of its annual range of 1 percent

to 5 percent. M3 growth also picked up in May, to an 8 percent
pace, and remained well above the upper bound of its annual range of
0 percent to 4 percent. Available data for June suggest that M3
growth will be a brisk 12 percent for the month, owing primarily to
a surge of flows into institution-only money market mutual funds.
This volatile and interest-sensitive component was likely boosted by
the decline in money market rates that made money funds relatively
more attractive. Given the pickup in M2 and M3 and the likely
prospects for nominal income in the second quarter, the velocities
of the broad aggregates appear to have fallen for the first time in
more than four years. Meanwhile, M1 is expected to be about flat in
June after having contracted in May, as implementation of sweep
programs in May and early June reduced other checkable deposits.
The sweep programs have no effect on M2, however.
The staff believes that the recent pickup in M2 relative to
nominal income primarily reflects portfolio reallocations, in part
responding to declines in market rates relative to returns available
on M2 assets. The strength in M2 over the past two months has been
driven by inflows to retail money market mutual funds and small time
deposits. Money funds grew at a 28 percent pace in May and are
estimated to have surged to more than a 50 percent growth rate in
June. When market rates fall sharply, as they have in recent
months, returns on money funds lag and thus become attractive
relative to other short-term investments. Indeed, with the front
end of the yield curve currently inverted, money funds are paying
returns above the rates that banks offer on five-year certificates
of deposit. The competition from money funds may also account for
some of the recent weakness in net noncompetitive tenders at
Treasury auctions, which appear to be averaging less than $1 billion

at a monthly rate this quarter, compared with a six-year high of
nearly $4 billion a month in the first quarter.
Small time deposits continue to register strong growth, at an
18 percent pace in May and at a 12 percent rate in May. Rates paid
on these deposits have fallen less than those on Treasury securities
of comparable maturities and remain well above rates paid on liquid
deposits. Even so, growth of small time deposits is below the
nearly 25 percent pace of earlier in the year.
Outside of the monetary aggregates, flows into long-term mutual
funds picked up in the second quarter (chart). Net purchases of
equity mutual funds shares eased slightly in May and June but
remained above their pace during the first quarter. Net flows into
bond funds remained weak in May after outflows last year and a flat
first quarter. Municipal and income funds grew modestly, but much
of the rise in assets in these funds likely reflects reinvested
dividends rather than new money from investors. Inflows into
high-yield bond funds continued in May. More recently, municipal
and high-yield funds have reversed these gains, and, on balance,
bond funds posted modest outflows over the first three weeks of
June.
Growth of bank credit softened in May and appears to have eased
further in June. The decline in growth in May was attributable to a
contraction in holdings of securities, as the marking to market of
derivatives contracts reduced reported holdings in the other
securities category.
Loan expansion remained robust in May, at a 14 percent pace,
but slackened over the month, and appears to have slowed in June.
The softening is particularly pronounced in business loans, which
had increased near a 15 percent pace in April and May. Real estate
loans in May posted their smallest advance of the year, and their

growth in June appears moderate as well. In contrast, consumer
lending at banks has continued to be brisk. The rise in May was at
only a 4-1/2 percent pace, but it was held down by a spate of
securitizations. Adjusting for loans that were removed from banks'
books puts consumer loan growth in May at an 11 percent rate, and
growth in June appears higher. The volatile security loan category
jumped in May, as dealers' financing needs likely rose with the
pickup of underwriting activity in corporate securities.
Data from the March Call Report indicate that delinquency rates
for business and real estate loans at banks continued to fall while
those on consumer loans flattened (chart). In terms of dollar
volume, delinquent loans touched bottom last year and have ticked up
since (chart).
Business Finance
Net borrowing by nonfinancial corporations remained sizable in
May and June, primarily owing to a sharp pickup in bond issuance
after a prolonged period of quiescence. With long-term yields down
to their lowest levels since February 1994 and the term structure
relatively flat, firms found it attractive to lock in bond rates.
The resurgence in gross public offerings was broad based,
encompassing investment-grade and junk issues in all maturity
ranges.
Quality spreads on bonds increased a bit as the market absorbed
the hefty volume of new issues, but spreads remained narrow by
historical standards. Spreads on junk bonds widened somewhat more
than those on investment-grade bonds. Even so, the overall climate
for junk issuance has remained favorable.
A portion of the proceeds from long-term debt issues has been
used to repay nonfinancial commercial paper, and outstandings fell
steadily through May and early June. The paydowns reflected, in

III-12
part, a substitution to longer-term bond funding of mergers and
acquisitions that were completed in late 1994 and earlier this year.
Given the large volume of commercial paper issued for mergers and
acquisitions, further paydowns are expected in coming months.
Nonfinancial merger activity has continued to be strong.
Several large mergers have been announced since late May, led by
IBM's $3.5 billion acquisition of the Lotus Corporation and
Kimberly-Clark's $7.1 billion merger with Scott Paper. Consistent
with the pattern over the past year, most recent deals have been
nonhostile, strategic alliances between firms in a single industry.
In addition, the form of payment has continued to be split fairly
evenly between stock swaps and cash. IBM is expected to tap its
large liquid reserves to finance its cash payment to Lotus
shareholders; financing for the other cash transactions has not yet
been announced.
ITT stated in mid-June that it would split into three separate
publicly traded companies. ITT stock traded up substantially to
reach a fifteen-year high on the announcement. In addition to ITT,
twenty-five other spinoffs have been announced thus far this year,
up from last year's pace that eventually totaled forty-five
transactions valued at a record $17.8 billion.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations, both
initial and seasoned offerings, was up slightly in May over the slow
pace earlier this year. As has been the case since the beginning of
the year, most of the initial public offerings have involved
technology firms and, mirroring the recent strength among
semiconductor and software stocks, demand for these offerings has
been strong. Seasoned issuance was bolstered by a large offering by
DuPont to finance its repurchase of shares from Seagram. Excluding
DuPont, seasoned offerings have remained light. Despite the new

III-13
highs touched by major stock indexes, issuance has been damped by
price-to-earnings measures that remain well below those prevailing
earlier in the expansion. Analysts' forecasts of earnings through
1996 have continued to hold up fairly well on balance, though the
estimates for companies serving the domestic consumer sector appear
to have been pared somewhat.
Municipal Securities
Yields on tax-exempt bonds have changed little over the
intermeeting period despite appreciable declines in long-term
Treasury rates. Investors have become increasingly concerned that
the Congress might alter income tax laws in a way that would reduce
or eliminate the value of the tax exemption of interest received
from such securities. The yield ratio for thirty-year tax-exempt to
Treasury bonds rose to 93 percent in mid-June, its highest since
November 1989 (chart). At shorter maturities, the tax-exempt to
taxable yield ratio has remained about unchanged at 70 percent,
presumably because any revamping of the tax code is expected to be
some way off in the future.
The narrowing of the long-term spread has occurred even as
retirements have outpaced gross issuance, reducing the outstanding
level of long-term municipal debt by an estimated $24 billion thus
far this year. Gross issuance of long-term tax-exempt debt picked
up a bit during May and June, in part owing to refunding activity.
However, such activity is not expected to rise appreciably further,
even in the event of additional declines in interest rates, because
little debt remains eligible after the wave of advance refundings in
1993.1 During May, short-term tax-exempt issuance continued to
be light, and outstandings fell about $1-1/4 billion; however, in
recent weeks there has been a seasonal pickup in issuance.
1. The 1986 Tax Reform Act restricts state and local governments
to only one refinancing of a tax-exempt debt issue.

Market participants continue to focus on developments in Orange
County, California. On June 27, Orange County voters overwhelmingly
rejected a 1/2 percentage point increase in the county's sales tax,
making it almost certain the county will default on about $800
million in debt. Defeat of the measure was widely anticipated and
appeared to have little immediate impact on prices of other insured
municipal debt. Meanwhile, investors balked at buying $155 million
in bonds the county offered on the same day, despite a bank letter
of credit that guarantees repayment of the debt. Underwriters of
the bonds ended up absorbing the bulk of the securities.
Federal Finance
The inflow of federal tax receipts has been heavier than
expected and is anticipated to produce a budget surplus of
$35 billion in the second quarter. These tax proceeds have caused
the Treasury's cash balance to surge even as its marketable
borrowing has slowed from $74 billion in the first quarter to
$23 billion in the second quarter. By quarter's end, the Treasury
plans to have paid down $14 billion in bills; but auction sales of
coupon securities will net $37 billion.
Given the high level of the cash balance now, the Treasury
likely will have enough room within its current debt authority of
$4.9 trillion to operate until late October, although the cash
balance will be on the lean side in early September.
Net borrowing by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the
second quarter appears to have picked up slightly from the sluggish
pace of the preceding three months. Gross issuance of debt has
risen as the enterprises refunded callable securities carrying rates
above those currently available. Yield spreads on the new debt
issues remain tight, in the neighborhood of 20 basis points over
Treasury rates.

Global bonds are becoming a bigger source of funds for
agencies. The bonds can be settled on a variety of clearing systems
and they trade in relatively liquid secondary markets. In June, the
Tennessee Valley Authority--an agency on the federal budget--joined
the GSEs in tapping this market, raising about $2 billion. The TVA
deal, the largest single issue ever by a company owned or sponsored
by the U.S. government, was well received. Indeed, the issue size
was doubled because of investor demand.
Mortgage Markets
The average contract rate on conventional fixed-rate mortgage
loans has fallen roughly 30 basis points on net since the May FOMC
meeting. At about 7-1/2 percent, the rate has returned to the
levels that prevailed in early March 1994. Rates on adjustable-rate
mortgages indexed to one-year Treasuries have declined somewhat less
over the period; at 169 basis points, the initial rate advantage of
these ARMs is the narrowest since mid-December 1990. With the large
drop in FRM rates, thirty-year fixed-rate loans have become more
popular among homebuyers, and the ARM share of conventional mortgage
originations has declined (chart). According to the Federal Housing
Finance Board, the ARM share of originations declined in May for the
fourth consecutive month to 38 percent, down from 59 percent in
January. This measure is based on loan closings rather than
applications and thus reflects interest rate developments with some
lag; a further rise in the FRM proportion seems likely.
The downtrend in mortgage interest rates has sparked a pickup
in borrowing activity, especially refinancings. The Mortgage
Bankers Association (MBA) indexes of loan applications and new
indexes constructed by J.P. Morgan (chart) provide timely signals of
potential market activity based on the number of applications at

survey respondents.2 Since late April the J.P. Morgan purchase
index has increased about 11 percent, while the MBA purchase index
is up roughly 18 percent on net. Both surveys indicate that the
refinancing share of total applications has increased. Despite the
sizable increase in the indexes, the longer MBA series indicates
that aggregate refinancing is currently less than one-third of the
peak levels of 1993. Most market participants expect that, in the
absence of a further significant drop in interest rates, refinancing
is unlikely to approach those earlier levels. According to data on
home mortgages securitized by agencies, the proportion of
2. J.P. Morgan and the MBA collect information from leading
mortgage lenders on the number of new applications each week. The
lenders surveyed by the MBA account for about 40 percent of all home
mortgage originations. Those surveyed by J.P. Morgan cover about 50
percent of all originations.

outstanding fixed-rate loans that are considered good candidates for
refinancing at current interest rates is considerably less than in
the 1992-93 episode.
Much of the current refinancing is probably by borrowers who
purchased homes in the past year or so, when FRM rates were near
8-3/4 percent on average, and by borrowers holding ARMs that are
adjusting upward. Treasury-based ARMs originated during 1992 or
early 1993 would now have rates well in excess of current contract
rates on FRMs (chart). Data from Freddie Mac show that more than
60 percent of conventional ARMs that were refinanced in the first
quarter were replaced by an FRM (chart).
The pickup in origination of FRMs has contributed to a slight
increase in issuance of agency pass-through securities, and issuance
is likely to be somewhat higher in the next several months as recent
FRM originations make their way to the secondary market. Issuance
also will be boosted by the settlement of a record $6.4 billion swap
of payment-capped ARM loans for pass-throughs between Freddie Mac
and Home Savings of America, the nation's largest thrift.
Consumer Credit
Growth in consumer installment credit retreated somewhat in
April from the strong advance in March, but at 14 percent was a
shade above the pace of the first quarter as a whole. The
still-brisk consumer borrowing is broadly consistent with the
pattern of durable goods sales over the same period. Although
outlays for durables have been flat this year, they had climbed
sharply in the second half of 1994. The level of spending is still
high enough to generate a large volume of loan originations, but
with repayments continuing to rise in lagged response to growth in
the stock of credit outstanding over the past few years, the net
flow of credit should begin to moderate gradually.

III-23
Increased use of credit cards for transactions has continued to
boost installment credit and may have softened the downward pull
resulting from the slowdown in the growth of outlays for durable
goods. Revolving credit, which is now close to 40 percent of
installment credit, remains the fastest growing component, with
recent gains in excess of 20 percent at an annual rate. In addition
to rebate programs and other incentives, credit card use has been
stimulated by the expanding range of opportunities for using cards,
such as for grocery store purchases.
The cost to consumers of financing credit card debt apparently
declined on balance last year even as interest rates rose on other
types of consumer credit. Insofar as more than half of all credit
card accounts now pay adjustable-rates, the increases in short-term
market rates between early last year and early this year were
presumably giving an upward push to credit card rates. However,
balance transfer programs featuring low initial rates and other
promotions have tended to pull down average rates paid. The Board's
new series on average rates paid on accounts that are assessed
finance charges showed a slight drop between November and February
but rebounded in May.
In contrast, the average "most common" rate on a forty-eight
month new-car loan at banks jumped sharply between November and
February and edged up slightly further on net in the May survey
(chart). Rates on personal loans followed a similar path. Because
yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturity fell between
February and May, spreads over Treasuries for the two consumer loan
rates rose. The auto loan spread has risen to about the middle of
its ten-year range after being unusually low most of last year.
Historically, most of the large swings in such spreads have mirrored

changes in Treasury rates; movements in consumer loan rates lag
changes in Treasury yields, and they tend to be more gradual.
Delinquency rates on household debt presented a mixed picture
during the first quarter (chart). Most series on home mortgage
delinquencies registered declines and were at very low levels. Some
series for consumer loans were also at low levels, but others, such
as auto loan delinquencies at the auto finance companies, have
climbed fairly sharply over the past two quarters or so. The
American Bankers Association (ABA) has reported a particularly steep
rise in credit card delinquencies at banks since 1994:Q3, as
measured by the proportion of accounts that are past due.
Calculations from Call Report data on dollar balances also show
increases in the fourth and first quarters, but the rise was much
smaller than reported by the ABA. Delinquencies on closed-end
consumer loans increased slightly in the first quarter, according to
the ABA, but the previous quarter's past-due ratio was the lowest in
more than twenty years.

The level of exports of goods and services for April was
modestly higher at an annual rate than the first-quarter level.
Increases in exports of aircraft and industrial supplies were
partially offset by declines in exports of automotive products to
Canada and Mexico. The change in exports was largely in quantity;
the exception was exports of industrial supplies, where virtually
all of the increase was in prices.
Imports of goods and services in April were about 3 percent
higher at an annual rate than the first-quarter level, about the
same rate of increase as those seen in the past two quarters.
Increases were posted in all major import categories except food and
services. Imports of industrial supplies and consumer goods
continued to expand at a healthy pace. A drop in imports of
automotive products from Canada and Mexico about offset a jump in

automotive imports from other countries; the jump was partly
attributable to the introduction of some new models, and imports
from Japan accounted for about half of the increase. As with
exports, most of the increase in imports was in quantity.
The total quantity of oil imported in April fell on higher
domestic production and a contra-seasonal decline in inventories.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that in May
seasonal inventory accumulation has set in and we estimate that
imports rose.
The price of imported oil rose sharply in April, just over
$1.00 per barrel. Oil prices rose on increased tension between the
United States and both Iran and Iraq, a relatively tight gasoline
market in the United States, and seasonally lower production in the
North Sea. During May, spot oil prices (West Texas Intermediate -
WTI) averaged slightly less than in April, as prices eased at the
end of the month given the impending suspension of the month-long
Brazilian oil workers strike.
Currently, spot WTI is trading at around $18 per barrel,
compared with an April-May average of $19.80 per barrel. Oil prices
fell sharply in mid-June on concern over prospective higher OPEC
production due to comments by an OPEC leader that the cartel may
suspend quotas to regain market shares.
Prices of Merchandise Non-oil Imports and Exports
The price of U.S. non-oil imports rose 1/2 percent in April.
This rate of increase was much faster than the increases seen in the
first quarter and a bit larger than those seen in the last half of
1994. Most of the April increase was in prices of imported capital
goods and industrial supplies. The price of imported food, which
has been quite volatile in recent months, fell 2-1/2 percent in
April, reflecting weaker prices for vegetables and coffee.

The price of U.S. exports posted another strong increase in
April, somewhat faster than the already robust rate of increase seen
in the first quarter. The bulk of the increase was in prices of
exported agricultural products (primarily soybeans and wheat) and
industrial supplies.
Price data for U.S. merchandise trade for May will be released

U.S. Current Account in 1995:Q1
In the first quarter of 1995, the U.S. current account deficit
was $11 billion SAAR smaller than in the fourth quarter of 1994.
Decreased net payments of investment income and a seasonal drop in
unilateral transfers more than offset a widening in the trade
deficit for goods and services.
Decreased net payments of investment income were attributable
to an increase in net direct investment receipts (mostly
manufacturing) of $8-1/2 billion. Net payments on portfolio capital

rose by $1-1/2 billion in the quarter, largely attributable to a
further deterioration of the net portfolio position.
U.S International Financial Transactions
Capital inflows through both foreign official sources and
private purchases of U.S. securities slowed between March and April.
These smaller inflows were more than offset by a swing in private
banking flows from large net outflows in March to large net inflows
in April. U.S. net purchases of foreign securities slowed between
March and April, but remained near the modest first-quarter pace.
The reduction in foreign official inflows in April reflected
smaller intervention purchases of dollars by foreign industrial
countries. Intervention purchases by Japan in April, although much
smaller than in March, remained substantial, and increases in
Japanese reserves in the United States account for most of the
increase in total official reserves (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). Official reserves held by
Mexico, Chile, and Russia also increased in April.
Partial data for May from the FRBNY show modest official
inflows.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. securities slowed to $8-1/2
billion in April from $12-1/2 billion in March (line 4). Foreign
purchases of both Treasuries and corporate bonds fell off in April.
New Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations picked up in May.
Foreigners on net purchased a small amount of corporate stocks in
April--the first month of net purchases since November of last year.
U.S. private net purchases of foreign securities fell slightly
from March to April, but remained above the weak first-quarter pace
(line 5). Nearly all of the decline in net purchases was
concentrated in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The huge outflow recorded for private banking transactions in
March was largely reversed in April (line 3). On a monthly average
basis, data on banks' transactions with their own foreign offices
and IBFs do not show these sharp swings (line 1 of the International
Banking Data table). In fact, these data show continuing net
Eurodollar borrowing by banks through May, accompanied by rising
deposits of U.S. residents at offshore banking offices (line 3).
Balance of payments data for the first quarter recorded large
outflows through U.S. direct investment abroad and relatively small
inflows from foreign direct investment in the United States. As
with the banking data for the first quarter, the direct investment
flow data are likely distorted by temporary factors. The U.S.
offices of both domestic and foreign-based financial firms lent
large sums to their foreign affiliates, which is recorded as a
direct investment outflow. Data on mergers and acquisitions in the
first quarter would indicate a larger inflow of direct investment
than that which was recorded. The statistical discrepancy in the
first quarter was a positive $19 billion, indicating a substantial
unrecorded inflow. Only part of the unrecorded inflow in the first
quarter can be accounted for by large increases in foreign holdings
of U.S. currency.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average dollar has declined 2-1/2 percent on balance
since the May 23 FOMC meeting as the dollar has depreciated 3-1/3 percent
against the mark and 1-3/4 percent against the yen. The dollar declined
sharply early in the intermeeting period and then rebounded somewhat due
to concerted intervention by G-10 countries on May 31. In June, the
dollar's oscillations in a fairly narrow range have been driven mostly by
technical factors as most market participants reportedly have been
hesitant to open new positions before the future courses of monetary
policy in the United States and Germany, and to a lesser extent, Japan,

become more apparent. On June 28, the dollar rose 1-1/2 percent against
the yen, and 1/2 percent on a weighted-average basis, following the
announcement that U.S. and Japanese negotiators had reached agreement in
the auto trade talks.
The dollar's precipitous drop in the days immediately following
the May 23 FOMC meeting reflected U.S. data releases on May 25 that
showed a sharp decline in durable goods orders in April and a large
increase in initial jobless claims in the second week of May. Both of
these releases were seen as evidence that economic activity in the United
States was decelerating faster than the market had expected, thereby
increasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would ease monetary
policy in the near term. The dollar recouped nearly half its losses when
central banks in the G-10 countries surprised the market on May 31 with
concerted intervention purchases of dollars. The Desk purchased $500
million against yen and $500 million against marks for the accounts of
the System and the Treasury.
Since May 31, the dollar has traded in a fairly narrow range. There
appears to be little interest to buy the dollar due to the weakness of
recent economic indicators in the United States. In addition, there are
a number of factors that reportedly have made many market participants
unwilling to open new positions. In early June, there reportedly was
little desire to open new positions ahead of the G-7 summit meeting on
June 15-17 although most market participants did not expect the
announcement of any major economic policy packages at that meeting.
Since the conclusion of the G-7 meeting, this hesitancy among most market
participants to open new positions has continued due to uncertainty

IV-13
surrounding the auto trade talks between the United States and Japan,
which were successfully concluded on June 28, and to the upcoming
meetings of the Bundesbank Council on June 29 and July 13, and the FOMC on
July 5-6.
Within Europe, DM cross rates have been generally stable over the
intermeeting period. However, the British pound has declined 3 percent
against the mark due in part to renewed intra-party squabbling within the
ruling Conservative Party over European integration. In addition, the
resignation on June 22 of John Major as leader of the Conservative Party,
which will force the party to choose a new leader and hence, prime
minister, has weighed on the pound. Sterling's weakness has contributed
to the 2 percent decline of the Irish punt. The Swedish krona has
depreciated 2 percent due in part to rising inflation in Sweden and
market expectations that the upcoming Swedish budget will not go far
enough in correcting that country's fiscal woes. The French franc has
strengthened 1 percent as market uncertainty over the economic policies
of the newly elected Chirac government has dissipated.
Short-term interest rates in the United Kingdom jumped 1/4
percentage point following the resignation of John Major as Conservative
Party leader. Following monetary tightening by the Bank of Italy and the
Swedish Riksbank, short-term rates in Italy and Sweden have risen. In
contrast, monetary easing in Belgium and the Netherlands has provided
scope for short-term rates in those countries to decline. French short-
term rates have drifted lower as pressure on the French franc has
subsided. In Canada, short-term rates have fallen as the Bank of Canada
has reduced its target range for the Canadian overnight rate by 50 basis
points since the May 23 FOMC meeting.
In contrast to the marked decline in long-term interest rates in
the United States over the intermeeting period, long-term rates in most
European countries have remained about unchanged. Long-term rates in
the United Kingdom backed up following John Major's resignation, and

IV-14
renewed political uncertainty in Italy, initiated by former-Prime
Minister Berlusconi's call for general elections in October, has
contributed to the rise in Italian long-term rates. In Japan, long-term
rates have declined due to the weakness of the Japanese economy and as
investors continue to shift funds from the depressed Japanese stock
market, which on June 13 reached its lowest point since August 1992, to
the bond market. Since May 23, the Japanese stock market has declined
8 percent due to the weakness of the Japanese economy and to heightened
concerns about the fragility of the banking system.
The Mexican peso has depreciated 5 percent against the dollar
during the intermeeting period as peso-denominated short-term interest
rates have fallen 7 to 8 percentage points. Mexican stock prices are
about unchanged on balance, and the interest rate spread of Mexican Brady
bonds against U.S. Treasury securities of similar maturity has widened
1/2 percentage point. Mexican banks have continued to repay their
FOBAPROA loans as outstanding balances have declined by $800 million
since May 23 to $1.5 billion.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
After expanding rapidly last year, economic activity appears to
have moderated in the first half of this year in most major foreign
industrial countries. The slowdown has been particularly sharp in
Canada, where all components of demand except inventory accumulation
were flat or declined in the first quarter and recent indicators suggest
output may be falling in the second quarter. The economic expansion also
appears to have moderated to a lesser extent in the major European
countries, except Italy, which had a stagnant fourth quarter. Growth in
Japan was anemic in the first quarter after falling in the fourth quarter
and appears to have remained weak in the second quarter.
Consumer price inflation has slowed in the major foreign
industrial countries with currencies that have strengthened, especially
in Japan, where prices have declined. On the other hand, inflation has

IV-15
picked up somewhat in countries with currencies that have depreciated,
especially in Italy.
Individual country notes. Japanese real GDP increased 0.3 percent
(SAAR) in the first quarter of 1995, after falling a revised 3.9 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1994. Personal consumption was nearly flat, but
government consumption grew strongly because of the earthquake relief
effort. Growth in private corporate investment and housing was offset by
steep declines in government investment.

Data for the second quarter point to continued weakness in private-
sector activity. Industrial production fell in April and May, but the
April-May average remained 0.8 percent higher than the first-quarter
average. New car registrations, an important indicator of durable
consumption and machinery orders, have declined considerably so far in
the second quarter. The unemployment rate worsened in April but improved
slightly in May. However, the job offers/applicants ratio deteriorated
in both April and May. suggesting that the labor market may have
deteriorated further. In May, the government announced fiscal measures
totaling 0.5 percent of Japan's GDP to cope with the recent appreciation

IV-16
of the yen. Recently, it was announced that a larger fraction of planned
spending will occur in the next several months.
In the Bank of Japan's May Tankan survey, the index of business
sentiment of major manufacturing firms registered -16, less negative
than the previous survey taken in February. This was the fifth
consecutive increase after more than four years of decline. However,
firms predicted a fall in investment of 8.3 percent in the fiscal year
that began in April 1995, worse than the 5.6 percent drop predicted in
February.

The yen's appreciation has contributed to deflationary pressures.
Falling wholesale prices have fed through to a decline in consumer
prices; nationwide consumer prices in April were down 0.2 percent from a
year earlier. Furthermore, price indices using sales at selected
supermarkets show 12-month deflation of over 4 percent.
Recent information on Germany is limited as the conversion of data
on orders, production, and sales to new EU methods has delayed the
publication of these series and impaired their comparability with

IV-17
previous data. However, some slowing in the economy from last year's
rapid pace appears to have occurred. In western Germany, industrial
production fell 4.1 percent in the first quarter, but much of this
decline has been attributed to the changeover in statistical methods.
Meanwhile, first-quarter capacity utilization showed another strong
gain. However, the unemployment rate has remained constant at 8.2
percent since late last year. The pan-German volume of retail sales rose
1 percent in April from a year earlier after falling in the first quarter
from their previous-year level.

Production plans have been lowered sharply in the wake of the
appreciation of the DM that has occurred this year. The net percentage
of firms that expect to increase production over the next six months
averaged 4 percent in April and May after peaking near 20 percent late
last year. Firms' assessment of their inventory situation also worsened
slightly between January and May.
The appreciation of the DM has helped restrain inflation recently,
as import prices fell in each of the three months ending in April.
Western German consumer price inflation dropped to 2.2 percent on a 12-
month basis in May, its lowest level in over six years. However,

IV-18
preliminary data indicate that inflation increased to 2.3 percent in
June, contrary to expectations of further deceleration. There were some
special factors affecting the preliminary inflation data, including oil
price increases. However, some of the rise was in the service sector and
is thought to reflect the relatively high wage settlements that have
occurred this year.
In eastern Germany, production rose 2.1 percent in the first
quarter. However, these data are affected by the same problems as the
western German data. The unemployment rate in May was 13.3 percent,
about two percentage points below its year-ago level.

In France, real GDP growth was 2.9 percent (SAAR) in the first
quarter, down slightly from the rate registered in the fourth quarter.
This slowing was more than accounted for by a negative contribution from
inventories. Investment growth picked up, but consumption remained
relatively weak after declining in the fourth quarter. Net exports made
a substantial positive contribution to growth as import growth dropped
sharply.
Monthly indicators for the second quarter have been mixed. In
April, capacity utilization in manufacturing and investment intentions
remained unchanged from January according to a quarterly business survey
by INSEE, the French statistics institute. The June INSEE survey of

business confidence indicated that businessmen expect production to
weaken. It also showed that orders declined, while inventories rose
slightly. On the other hand, consumption of manufactured products
(equal to one-third of total consumption) rebounded strongly in April
and May.
Consumer prices in May were 1.6 percent above their year-earlier
level. This good inflation performance was partly due to relatively
moderate wage inflation. Hourly wages in the first quarter were 2.2
percent above their year-earlier level, up slightly relative to the
increase registered in the fourth quarter.
Prime Minister Juppe presented the new French government' s
mini-budget for 1995 on June 22. The budget seeks to fulfill President
Chirac' s promise to reduce unemployment and maintain progress towards
meeting the Maastricht budget criterion. The budget contains
significant job creation measures but, on balance, shifts fiscal policy
toward a more restrictive stance. Although it leaves the 1995 central
government budget deficit target unchanged at 4.6 percent of GDP, it

increases taxes significantly in order to prevent a projected
overshooting of the target. In particular, the VAT was increased by 2
percentage points to 20.6 percent, and the corporate income tax was
increased by over 3 percentage points to 36.6 percent.
Growth in the United Kingdom continued to slow in the first quarter
from its rapid pace last year. Total real GDP grew 2.7 percent (SAAR),
but GDP excluding oil and gas extraction grew only 2.3 percent. Every
component of domestic demand fell in the first quarter, while net exports
expanded rapidly.
Activity in the second quarter appears to have continued to expand
moderately. Industrial production fell in April but was 0.4 percent
higher than the first-quarter average. After falling in the first
quarter, retail sales continued to be weak in April and May, leaving
average April-May sales about 0.3 percent higher than the first-quarter
average. Since late last year, consumer expenditure has been diverted
from retail sales by overwhelming participation in the new national
lottery; the introduction of the lottery is estimated to have reduced
retail sales so far this year by about 2 percentage points. As
participation in the lottery stabilizes, retail sales growth should pick

government-sponsored research institute, showed a modest improvement in
production plans relative to the first quarter and relatively stable
orders. The ISCO consumer survey showed that consumer confidence
rebounded in April and May. Unemployment fell somewhat in the second
quarter to 12 percent from its peak in the first quarter.
Inflation has risen sharply in Italy. In June, data from the eight
largest Italian cities pointed to an increase in consumer prices of 5.8
percent relative to their year-earlier level. This rise in measured
inflation reflects the effects of the depreciation of the lira, which has
pushed up intermediate goods prices, as wage increases have remained
modest. Hourly wages in both April and May were 2 8 percent above their
year-earlier level; in contrast, wholesale prices in April were 11.3
percent above their year-earlier level.

On May 31, Prime Minister Dini proposed reducing the central
government budget deficit from an estimated 7 1/2 percent of GDP this
year to 3 percent of GDP in 1998, thus allowing Italy to satisfy the
Maastricht budget deficit criterion by 1999. The planned deficit-
reduction measures are conditional on optimistic growth and interest
rate assumptions. Dini also stated that the government will consider
rejoining the ERM in the autumn.
In Canada, real GDP expanded only 0.7 percent (SAAR) in the first
quarter, while final domestic demand (not shown) decreased 0.4 percent.
Business inventory accumulation rose sharply, contributing 3.9 percent
to the quarter's growth. Statistics Canada attributed the sharp
deceleration in activity to the combined effects of rising interest
rates, strikes in the transportation sector, and a weakening U.S.
economy.

Preliminary indicators suggest that activity has weakened in the
second quarter. Retail sales picked up slightly in April but remained
0.6 percent below the first-quarter average. Manufacturers' shipments

IV-24
and new orders fell further in April to well below first-quarter
averages. Employment was unchanged in May, the sixth consecutive month
with little employment growth. Housing starts in May fell to their
slowest pace in 13 years. However, consumer price inflation increased
further in May to near the top of the Bank of Canada' s target band for the
end of 1995. The increase in 12-month inflation between February and May
reflects in part the removal of the beneficial effects of tax reductions
last year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela is sluggish,
and mounting evidence suggests that Brazil's economy has slowed. The
Asian developing countries, in contrast, continue to grow robustly.
During the first quarter, real GDP expanded by 9.9 percent in Korea and 7
percent in Taiwan from year-earlier levels. Chinese industrial value
added during the first five months of 1995 was 14 percent higher than
during the same period last year.
Exports from many developing countries have expanded rapidly in
1995. Through May, exports were up by about 50 percent in China and
Argentina and by over 30 percent in Mexico. Import growth has varied
widely, contracting in Mexico and Venezuela, while almost doubling in
Brazil.

Since the last Greenbook, the stripped spread on Argentina's Brady
bonds has increased by over 300 basis points, partially reflecting
concerns about the country's fiscal situation and whether the currency's
dollar parity is sustainable. The stripped spreads on Mexican and
Brazilian bonds have also increased, rising 40 basis points and 150 basis
points, respectively.
Individual Country Notes. In Mexico, the economy continues its
rapid adjustment to the devaluation of the peso and the tightening of
fiscal and monetary policy, amid mounting evidence that economic

IV-29
activity is contracting sharply. Industrial production (s.a.) rose 1.3
percent in March from February, but output for the first quarter was 0.7
percent below its year-earlier level. Real domestic demand (GDP less net
exports) declined by 10.3 percent in the first quarter of 1995 from its
year-earlier level, a much steeper decline than in real GDP and
industrial production, reflecting the sharp improvement in Mexican
trade performance. Of the components of domestic demand, gross fixed
investment fell 18.4 percent, private consumption fell 8.7 percent, but
government consumption declined by only 1.9 percent. The urban
unemployment rate (n.s.a.) rose to 6.3 percent in April.

The (preliminary) merchandise trade balance in May registered a
$600 million surplus, compared with a $1.5 billion deficit in May 1994.
Exports during the January-May period were 31 percent above their year-
earlier level, while imports were down 8 percent. Largely as a result of
the improved trade performance, the current account deficit declined to
$1.2 billion in the first quarter of 1995, from $6.7 billion in the first
quarter of 1994. Mexico's gross international reserves increased to
$10.4 billion as of June 23, from $6.9 billion at the end of March. This
increase reflects likely continued improvement in the current account
performance during the second quarter, moderation of pressures in

IV-30
financial markets leading to an improvement in Mexico's capital account
position, and drawings on international support packages.
Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in May, down from March and April.
April's inflation spike partially reflected an April 1 increase in the
value-added tax. The decline in May inflation from its March rate also
reflects some strengthening of the peso, from an average of about 6.7
pesos per dollar during March to about 6.2 pesos per dollar in recent
trading. During the first half of June, consumer prices were 1.7 percent
higher than in the second half of May, suggesting a further decline in
inflation.
On May 30, Mexico announced the buyout of ailing Mexican financial
group Probursa by Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which will increase its
holdings from 20 percent to 70 percent of Probursa shares. To support
the arrangement, which was made possible by a liberalization of laws on
foreign ownership of banks earlier this year, the Mexican government
will purchase a portion of Probursa's loan portfolio with interest-
bearing bonds at its estimated market value, thereby limiting risk to
investors. On June 13, it was announced that Mexico's third largest
bank, Banco Serfin, would be recapitalized by its shareholders, with the
government again providing support by purchasing part of Serfin's loan
portfolio but, in this case, without interest-bearing instruments. The
government hopes that such arrangements will help recapitalize the
Mexican banking system, which is burdened by large amounts of non-
performing loans and weak capital-asset ratios.
On June 30, the IMF Executive Board is scheduled to review Mexico's
performance under its stand-by arrangement. Waivers for some end-June
performance criteria are expected to be granted. The Board is also
expected to approve a disbursement schedule for the remaining $10
billion equivalent of Mexico's stand-by.
In Brazil, economic activity was very strong through the first
quarter of 1995, but recent evidence suggests that the economy has

IV-31
slowed. First-quarter real GDP was 10.5 percent higher than a year
earlier. In April, however, industrial production (s.a.) fell by 1.7
percent. The number of consumers and firms experiencing debt repayment
difficulties has also risen sharply in recent months. Since the
enactment of the exchange rate-based stabilization program in July 1994,
monthly inflation has remained relatively low, registering 2.5 percent
in May 1995.
On June 22, the Central Bank adjusted its exchange rate band,
moving the real-dollar band from 0.88-0.93 to 0.91-0.99. The real had
been near the mid-point of the previous band, with little intervention by
the Central Bank since March. The realignment was motivated by concerns
about the external position. Specifically, Brazil continued to record
large trade deficits in April and May 1995, bringing the trade deficit to
$3.5 billion over the January-May period, reflecting a near doubling in
imports; a trade surplus of $5.7 billion was recorded over the same
period last year. Surprisingly, the Central Bank announced that
international reserves (liquidity concept) rose from $31.8 billion at
end-April to $33.7 billion at end-May 1995.
Central Bank President Arida unexpectedly resigned on June 1.
Former Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola (previously in office
November 1992-April 1993) is his replacement. On June 1, in response to
evidence that the economy is slowing, the Central Bank lowered the
overnight rate on federal government securities from 65 percent a year to
61 percent a year and relaxed reserve requirements. On June 21, the
Central Bank also moved to ease the consumer debt burden by allowing
banks to reschedule consumer debts that were delinquent as of May 31.
In Argentina, industrial production in May was 3.6 percent below
its 1994 level. The recent slowdown in economic activity has contributed
to a rapid turnaround in Argentina's trade deficit during the last three
months, leading to a surplus of $770 million in May, reflecting a 50
percent increase in exports and no growth in imports from a year earlier.

IV-32
Gross international reserves stood at $13.5 billion as of mid-June, of
which $2.1 billion was in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds. The monetary
base was $11.1 billion, leaving $2.4 billion in excess reserves. May
consumer prices increased by 4.4 percent from a year earlier.
Argentina's fiscal situation remains difficult. Tax revenues
during May were 6 percent below the government's forecasts, due to the
weakness in economic activity. Concerns that Argentina will not achieve
the fiscal objectives outlined in its IMF program (perhaps necessitating
a waiver of program requirements), coupled with political conflicts
between Finance Minister Cavallo and Cabinet Chief Bauza, have led to
sharp price declines in Argentina's financial markets. Between June 6
and June 9, the Merval stock index and Argentina's Brady bond prices each
fell by more than 10 percent. Asset prices have since recovered only
slightly. In an effort to meet IMF fiscal requirements, Argentina
brought forward a wealth tax payment that was due later in the year and
postponed payments to government employees from the last week of June to
the first weeks of July.
Banking sector reform has progressed little since the May
presidential election, possibly due to government concerns that rapid
reform would further increase unemployment. Bank deposits have remained
stable at $39 billion.
In Venezuela, a continuing recession has led to an increase in the
unemployment rate from 7.8 percent in December 1994 to 11.4 percent in
March, according to official figures. Private sector analysts, however,
estimate that the jobless rate may have reached 15 percent. Venezuela
registered a trade deficit of $341 million in April, up from a deficit of
$191 million in March. Total reserves excluding gold were an estimated
$7.9 billion at the end of May, almost unchanged from the end of April.
Monthly consumer price inflation was 4.9 percent in May, up from 4.1
percent in April. During the first five months of 1995, consumer prices
increased by 18.9 percent, similar to the same period last year.

IV-33
In late May, the government reached preliminary agreement on an
anti-inflation pact with business and labor; a formal pact is expected to
be signed by the end of June. The government has promised increased
fiscal and monetary discipline in exchange for moderation in private
sector wage and price increases.
In China, industrial value added during the first five months of
1995 was 14 percent higher than a year earlier, compared with 18 percent
growth for all of 1994. Consumer prices in May were 20 percent higher
than a year earlier.
In the first five months of 1995, China ran a trade surplus of $10.3
billion, sharply improved from a $2 billion deficit during the same
period of 1994. Through May, exports jumped 49 percent and imports rose
16 percent from the year-earlier period. According to Chinese trade
statistics, exports have been strong to all major trading partners. In
the first four months of 1995 (the latest period for which detailed data
are available). Chinese exports rose 58 percent to Japan, 45 percent to
the European Union, and 37 percent to the United States. The export
surge may be slowing, however, as exports increased by 64 percent in the
first quarter, but by 35 percent in April and May.
Equity markets in China continue to be volatile. The Shanghai
stock market rose nearly 60 percent in three days during mid-May, for
example, after the authorities banned the sale of treasury bond futures.
The market then fell 17 percent when the authorities announced that they
were considering allowing new stock listings in 1995.
In Taiwan, real GDP rose 7 percent in the first quarter of 1995 from
the year-earlier period. Consumer prices at the end of May were 3.3
percent higher than a year earlier. In the first five months of 1995,
Taiwan ran a trade surplus of $2.3 billion, similar to the $2 billion
surplus during the same period last year. Through May, exports rose 23
percent and imports increased 24 percent from a year earlier. Foreign

IV-34
exchange reserves less gold reached $100 billion at the end of May 1995,
up $8 billion from the end of 1994.
Real output in Korea increased by 9.9 percent during the first
quarter of 1995 from its level a year earlier, despite the adoption of a
less accommodative monetary policy during the second half of 1994. Thus
far, the strong growth experienced during the recent cyclical upturn has
been consistent with a moderate level of consumer price inflation.
Consumer prices in May were 5.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
Korea's exports expanded at the most rapid pace in nearly a decade
during the early months of 1995, due in part to the appreciation of the
Japanese yen and continued strong demand for Korea's technologically
sophisticated manufactured goods. Exports in the first four months of
1995 increased by 33 percent from their year-earlier level in dollar
terms. However, imports increased by 36 percent over the same period
due to rapid growth in investment demand and to rising import prices.
This contributed to a widening of the current account deficit to $4.6
billion during the first four months of the year, compared with a deficit
of $2.4 billion a year earlier.
In Russia, the ruble continued to appreciate against the dollar,
rising by 3 percent during May and 10 percent during the first four weeks
of June. The ruble's recent strength reflects declining inflationary
expectations and subsequent increases in demand for ruble-denominated
assets. In mid-June, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) reduced its
refinance rate from 16.3 percent to 15 percent a month, in an attempt to
stem the ruble's appreciation. The CBR has also sold rubles frequently
in the foreign exchange market. This effort to limit the ruble's
appreciation (while allowing the Central Bank to replenish its official
reserves) has caused Russia's monetary aggregates to grow rapidly.
Broad money, after expanding by less than 10 percent during the first
quarter, jumped by 15 percent during April and another 7 percent during
May. As a result, inflation has remained stubbornly high. Consumer

IV-35
prices increased by 8 percent in May, little changed from the 8.5 percent
increase in April and the 9 percent increase in March. Russia's IMF
stand-by arrangement anticipates monthly inflation of one percent
during the last six months of 1995, which seems increasingly
unrealistic.
The budget deficit through May registered 4 percent of GDP,
consistent with the IMF program. A number of fiscal problems, however,
are emerging: revenue collection is less than projected, the growth of
tax arrears is accelerating, and the government has not fully
implemented the tax increases on the energy sector outlined in the stand-
by. In addition, seasonal pressures to fund the harvest and provide
credits to the Northern Regions will increase demand for fiscal
expenditures in coming months.
The decline in economic activity continues to slow. During the
first five months of 1995, real GDP was 3 percent below its year-earlier
level and industrial production was down by 4 percent. During the first
five months of 1994, by contrast, industrial production plunged 25
percent and real GDP declined 17 percent from a year earlier.
On May 26, the IMF Executive Board approved the first $550 million
equivalent monthly disbursement under Russia's stand-by arrangement.
The Executive Board is scheduled to consider the second disbursement on
July 14.
