DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Although the economic indicators have remained mixed, the
incoming data, on balance, point to a firming in activity early in
the current quarter. Output in the manufacturing sector was
restrained in July by ongoing efforts to pare inventories,
particularly those of motor vehicles. But final demand looks to be
continuing to grow moderately. With the exception of another dip in
auto sales, consumer spending is moving along at a healthy clip.
Moreover, housing demand appears to have rebounded sharply, and
business investment remains on a distinct uptrend. The news on
prices was favorable again in July.
Employment and Unemployment
July's employment figures suggest that labor demand remained
soft, although aggregate production worker hours continued to move
up and the retrenchment in initial claims in early August hints at
some strengthening in job growth. Beginning with the employment
data, nonfarm payroll employment was up only 55,000 in July.
Payroll employment changes over the past several months have been
buffeted by seasonal adjustment problems associated with the timing
of survey weeks. However, the average monthly gain over the
past four months, which smooths through most of these problems, was
only 63,000, well below the average pace of growth during the first
quarter.
By industry, manufacturing employment fell 85,000 in July, a
decline that brought total factory job losses over the past four
months to 188,000. Declines were widespread across both durable and
nondurable industries. In a few of these industries the declines
1. Specifically, although payroll employment rose 250,000 in
June, that increase was overstated by seasonal adjustment problems
associated with an early May and a late June survey week. The late
June survey week likely also borrowed a bit from the July change in
industries such as construction, hotels, and amusement services.

may have been exaggerated by seasonal adjustment difficulties. For
example, many of the suppliers of parts to General Motors shifted
their normal layoffs from the second half of July to the first two
weeks of the month, in response to the change that GM made beginning
last year to its summer vacation period. The effect of this shift
evidently has not yet been fully picked up by the seasonal factors
and likely contributed to the decline of 7,000 in motor vehicle
employment last month. In addition, some producers of textiles and
apparel may have extended their normal July 4 shutdown period into
the second week of July for purposes of inventory control.
Outside manufacturing, employment continued to rise in July,
but at a relatively slow pace. Excluding manufacturing, job gains
averaged just 100,000 per month during the second quarter and
totaled 140,000 in July. Over this four-month period, construction
employment has, on net, trended lower. In the services industry,
July's employment gain of 60,000 was a bit less than the average in
the second quarter and well below the first-quarter pace. Job
growth in services continued to be held down by relatively small
increases in employment at business and health service
establishments, the two industries that led employment gains in 1993
and 1994. In contrast, employment in wholesale and retail trade
advanced 71,000 last month, the largest rise this year; about two-
thirds of this increase was in eating and drinking places. The
number of jobs in finance, insurance, and real estate rose 7,000 in
July.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers
edged up 0.1 hour last month, to 34.6 hours, lifting the index of
aggregate production worker hours 1/2 percent, to a level
3/4 percentage point above the second-quarter average. The increase
occurred even though the workweek in manufacturing dropped 0.2 hour,

to 41.3 hours, bringing the cumulative decline in the factory
workweek since the beginning of the year to nearly one hour. In
combination with the decline in manufacturing employment, the drop
in the workweek resulted in a 1-1/4 percent decline in factory hours
last month.
In the household survey, employment jumped 474,000 in July, but
the labor force rose even more, and the unemployment rate edged up
0.1 percentage point, to 5.7 percent, the same as the second-quarter
average. The increases in both employment and the labor force were
concentrated among women aged 25 and over; the participation rate
for this group jumped to 58.6 percent, which, after allowing for the
break in the CPS, may be a new high for this series.
The weekly pattern of initial claims for unemployment insurance
was likely affected by the change in the timing of GM's vacation
schedule, as well as by the temporary layoffs in several other
industries. The result was a sharp spike in the first half of July
that was offset in the second half. On average, the July pace of
new claims held close to the average seen in June. However, the
latest week's figure, which refers to the week ending August 5, was
well below the July average. Because the seasonal adjustment
problems should have worked themselves out over July, the latest
figure may be a sign of a strengthening in the labor market.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose 3 percent at
an annual rate in the second quarter. Such a large increase in
productivity seems at odds with the sluggish pace of output growth
and is traceable largely to an unusually steep decline in hours.
Much of the decline in aggregate hours owed to a low workweek in the
second quarter, depressed by an unexplainably low estimate for May.
In addition, hours were depressed by a steep decline last quarter in
the number of self-employed workers, a series that is historically

quite volatile; indeed, in July the number of self-employed workers
rebounded to a level 3-1/2 percent above the second-quarter average.
Industrial Production
Industrial production was about unchanged again in July and was
essentially flat over the May-to-July period. Given the weakness in
total production since early this year and the rapid rate of
capacity expansion, the capacity utilization rate has dropped
2 percentage points since December 1994, to 83.4 percent, only about
1-1/2 percentage points above the long-run average rate.
Output at utilities was boosted in July by the unusually hot
weather; the number of cooling degree-days was the third highest
July reading since that of 1980. Mining output was up as well,
owing to increases in coal production and in oil and gas extraction.
However, manufacturing production fell 0.2 percent. For two
reasons, that decline is less than what might have been expected
based on the sharp drop in factory employment reported in the
payroll survey. First, incoming physical product data for
appliances and paper were stronger than the corresponding hours
data. In addition, some industries in which sharp drops in jobs
were reported, such as textiles and apparel, have lower value-added
weights in IP than their shares of employment while others, such as
computers and semi-conductors, where hours rose, have higher value-
added weights than their employment shares.
By industry, production of motor vehicles and parts dropped a
sharp 3.2 percent. Assemblies fell 0.4 million units in July, to an
annual rate of 11.2 million units, well below schedules in place at
the beginning of the month, and suppliers of parts are estimated to
have cut production by a comparable amount. Manufacturers'
schedules show assemblies rising to 12.0 million units in August and
12.3 million units in September. These plans appear ambitious,

Outside motor vehicles, manufacturing production was unchanged
in July. As in the second quarter, business equipment production
was the strongest component of this aggregate, with output gains led
by another jump in production of office and computing equipment.
Production of industrial equipment also posted another modest
increase. The output of non-motor vehicle manufactured consumer
goods fell 0.2 percent last month; weaker production of home
furnishings offset a gain in output of appliances. Materials
production turned up 0.2 percent.
Looking forward, other indicators of manufacturing activity are
consistent with a firming in production over the next couple of
months. Real new orders for goods in the adjusted durable goods
grouping grew more than 2-1/2 percent in both May and June. And the
purchasing managers indexes of new orders and production turned up
in July: in both indexes more companies reported increases than
decreases, a marked improvement from the readings in May and June.

remained lackluster. Sales of new light vehicles dipped in July to
a 14.2 million unit annual rate, and judging from the data so far
this year, the trend in sales appears to have dropped back to 14.6
million units, about 1/2 million units below the 1994 pace. This
year's relative weakness seems to indicate that the pent-up demand
accumulated during the early 1990s was largely satisfied when sales
reached a cyclical peak in the second half of 1994.
Sales in the control category of retail sales, which excludes
automotive dealers and building materials and supply stores.
increased 0.3 percent in July from a June level that was revised up
substantially. Sales of furniture and appliances now appear to have
firmed considerably over the past few months, likely reflecting, in
part, the strengthening of home sales. Sales of apparel, which had
also languished earlier in the year, have turned around. Given the
revisions to the retail sales data, we estimate that real consumer
spending rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second
quarter, 1/2 percentage point more than in the advance GDP release.
Although spending on goods has picked up in recent months, the
gains are still well below those recorded over the preceding three
years. The slowing in outlays for durables has been especially
dramatic, but it is broadly consistent with the experience in most
previous business cycles. The percentage of nominal income spent on
durables typically shoots up in the early phase of an expansion as
pent-up demands are worked off, but during the mature phase of the
expansion, it tends to fluctuate around a level somewhat below the
peak (chart). The resurgence of durable goods spending in the
current cycle occurred much later than usual--probably because
consumers remained pessimistic for so long--but the behavior of the
ratio over the past year is in line with the norm for a typical
mature expansion. Another notable feature of the current cycle is

II-13
the marked divergence among the major components of durables. When
measured relative to income, outlays for motor vehicles are at a
level somewhat below those typical of previous expansions, while the
boom in home electronics has pushed outlays for other durables to
their highest level since the mid-1970s.
We have no hard information on services expenditures in July,
but data on weather for the nation as a whole suggest that energy
spending rose moderately from an already high second-quarter level.
Real spending on services other than energy rose 2-3/4 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter, roughly in line with the
increases recorded over the preceding several quarters.
Growth in household income has clearly slowed from the rapid
pace of the past few years, although the deceleration in the
underlying trend is not as great as suggested by the second-quarter
data. The drop of 1-1/4 percent (annual rate) in real disposable
income in the second quarter was exaggerated by a spike in tax
payments in April as high-income households paid the second
installment of the retroactive OBRA-93 tax increase. Wages and
salaries were about flat in real terms for the quarter as a whole.
Looking ahead, however, the sizable increases in hours worked and
average hourly earnings in July, which come on the heels of a
moderate rise in wages and salaries in June, should set the stage
for a healthy gain in labor income in the current quarter. After
adjusting for the retroactive tax payments and the anticipated
revisions to the consumption data, the saving rate was about
4-1/2 percent in the second quarter, in line with the average over
the preceding four quarters.
Other key determinants of consumption remain sound. The July
readings on consumer sentiment from both the Michigan and the
Conference Board surveys held in the favorable ranges that have

prevailed since late last year (chart, top panel). Survey
respondents' expectations about unemployment also held steady
through June (chart, bottom panel), and the Conference Board
reported little change in expected labor market conditions in July.
By contrast, the Michigan survey showed an increase in unemployment
fears last month, but the sample is small and the July reading--even
if taken at face value--was still in a range generally associated
with moderate growth in consumption. In addition, the rallies in
the stock and bond markets this year have added appreciably to the
net worth of households, which should provide some impetus to
spending in coming quarters.
Housing Markets
Single-family housing production has strengthened appreciably
since May. Starts rose 4 percent in June and an additional
7 percent in July, reaching their highest level since last December.
Permit issuance for these projects has been on a similar uptrend,
further evidence of firming in this sector.
The increase in production is a response to stronger housing
demand. New home sales in May and June averaged 16 percent above
their pace during the first four months of the year. Sales of
existing homes also moved up significantly in May and June. House
prices, meanwhile, continued to increase at an annual rate of
2 percent to 4 percent in the second quarter, judging from the
constant-quality price indexes for new and existing homes. Average
transaction prices, which reflect changes in the mix of sales, have
been rising less rapidly.
Survey data through early August suggest that single-family
housing remains robust. Home builders reported continued
improvements in their assessments of current and expected sales, and
applications for home purchase loans remain well above the level

earlier this year. Availability of favorable terms on fixed-rate
mortgages has continued to boost demand, according to consumer
surveys. The cash-flow affordability of new homes in the second
quarter approached the twenty-five-year record set in late 1993.
Demand has also received a boost from demographics. After
running well below trend for several years, household formations
jumped in the year ending in the second quarter. This spurt may
help explain the surprising resilience of housing construction to
higher interest rates in the second half of last year. Most of the
increase in demand has been for owner-occupied housing. The overall
homeownership rate--that is, the percentage of households that own
their residence--rose to 64.7 percent in the second quarter, the
highest rate since 1983.
In contrast to the recent strength in the single-family market,
construction of multifamily housing has flagged. Starts of these
units in the past several months have been trendless at a level
about 15 percent below the five-year high recorded in the fourth
quarter of last year. Despite firming in some local markets,
vacancy rates for rental housing (two-thirds of which are
apartments) have not fallen much nationwide, nor have real rents
risen appreciably. Indeed, in the second quarter these two
variables hint of some softening in market conditions.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment increased at an annual rate of
12 percent in the second quarter after three quarters of even larger
gains. Equipment spending once again was boosted by surging
computer purchases, and construction of nonresidential structures
posted another substantial gain. However, looking ahead, growth of
investment seems likely to slow: Near-term indicators have been
mixed, and market fundamentals suggest some moderation as well.

Real equipment expenditures grew 13 percent at an annual rate
in the second quarter, even though spending for motor vehicles and
aircraft dropped sharply. Business spending for computers is
continuing on its strong upward trajectory, reflecting dramatic
improvements in performance for a wide variety of machines and
peripherals, aggressive pricing, and considerable upgrades in the
2quality of software. Real outlays for computers rose at an
annual rate of 60 percent in the second quarter, and the recent
trend in shipments points to a sizable gain in the third quarter.
Near-term prospects for other types of equipment are less
upbeat. Notably, orders for nondefense capital goods other than
aircraft and computers were about flat in the second quarter after
rising sharply early this year. In the motor vehicles sector,
purchases of cars and light trucks have been lackluster; sales of
heavy trucks, which had been robust through June, fell sharply in
July, and new orders have weakened considerably in recent months.
Purchases of aircraft, which had spurted in the first quarter, have
since fallen back to a level more in line with the average pace of
the past couple of years, and the continued paucity of orders from
domestic carriers suggests that improvement is not imminent.
The fundamentals for equipment investment are mixed but, on
balance, point to a moderation in spending growth over the next
several quarters. On the plus side, the cost of capital fell during
the first half of this year as a result of the rallies in bond and
equity markets and, even with the recent backup in long-term
interest rates, remains well below its level in the fourth quarter
2. The introduction of Windows 95 is unlikely to boost PDE
appreciably in the near term because business outlays on stand-alone
software are not counted as investment in the national income and
product accounts; rather, they are scored as intermediate inputs.
Over the longer run, however, many of the businesses that adopt new
software like Windows 95 (or "Cairo," which is the next version of
Windows NT and will be released in 1996) will upgrade their existing
machines or buy new ones to take full advantage of these programs.

of last year. In contrast, real cash flow has decelerated
considerably over the past year. Moreover, the accelerator effect,
which is based on long lags of changes in business output, has been
waning gradually during the past couple of years and is no longer
providing any impetus to growth in equipment outlays.
Construction of nonresidential structures posted another
substantial increase in the second quarter, with solid growth in all
major sectors but "other commercial." Permits in the aggregate also
continued to move up through June and imply a further robust gain in
construction in the current quarter. Nonetheless, the recent
increases in permits have been smaller than those recorded in 1994.
The tapering off of permits has been concentrated in the office and
other commercial sectors, the latter likely reflecting in part an
abundance of unrented retail space. By contrast, permits for
industrial structures have remained on a steep uptrend despite the
decreases in overall factory operating rates over the past several
months.
Inventories
Business inventory accumulation slowed markedly in June, and
inventories in many industries appear to be at, or approaching,
desired levels. Excluding motor vehicles, inventories in all
manufacturing and trade rose at a $28 billion annual rate (book
value) in June, little more than one-third of the average
accumulation from January to May.3 At the end of June,
inventory-sales ratios for most types of business establishments
were within their ranges of the previous twelve months and in some
instances were well below their recent peaks observed in spring. In
3. In real terms, non-auto inventories in manufacturing and trade
are estimated by the staff to have increased at an annual rate of
$11 billion in June and $20 billion over the second quarter as a
whole. The second-quarter accumulation is $7-1/2 billion below
BEA's assumption in the advance GDP estimate.

fact, in the July survey of the National Purchasing Managers'
Association, most respondents indicated that they feel both their
organization's inventories and their customers' inventories are at
about the right level for their expected sales.
Inventory investment in the manufacturing sector slowed to an
$8 billion annual rate in June, in contrast to the massive run-ups
earlier this year. Producers in many industries trimmed their
stocks, especially stocks of in-process goods that had backed up in
the preceding several months when output was reduced.
Downstream in wholesale trade, the inventory situation is
mixed. The accumulation of wholesale inventories became more
moderate and less widespread during the latter part of the second
quarter, although sales performances have been uneven, especially
among consumer goods. Apparel inventories, which had backed up
throughout the distribution chain earlier in the spring, were run
off by wholesalers in May and June, reducing the inventory-sales
ratio somewhat. In contrast, wholesale stocks of some consumer
durables, such as furniture and electrical goods, continued to grow
in June, and their stock-sales ratios remained high at mid-year.
In the retail sector, non-auto inventories expanded at an
$11 billion annual rate in June in book-value terms--roughly the
same as in the preceding two months. The bulk of the June
accumulation was in stocks at general merchandise and furniture and
appliance stores, where sales have also improved noticeably in
recent months. As in wholesale trade, retail apparel inventories
were reduced in June; the June liquidation followed two months of
little change, and the inventory-sales ratio has fallen
significantly as a result. On the whole, non-auto retail
inventories seem to be generally in line with the current pace of
sales.

Federal Sector
The incoming news on the budget for fiscal year 1995 continues
to be favorable, yet the longer-term uncertainties surrounding the
budget remain sizable. The deficit for the first nine months of
fiscal 1995 was 20 percent lower than it was during the comparable
period of fiscal 1994 (12 percent lower excluding deposit
insurance). Accordingly, both OMB and CBO have revised down their
deficit estimates for fiscal 1995 as a whole: OMB's projection in
The Mid-Session Review of the Budget is $160 billion (compared with
its February estimate of $193 billion), whereas CBO's upcoming
report will show a deficit in the range of $160 billion to $165
billion (compared with the March estimate of $175 billion).
Monthly Treasury Statements through June show that receipts are
about 8 percent above the same period last fiscal year, with growth
in all major categories. Individual income and social insurance
taxes combined were 8 percent higher than during the first nine
months of fiscal 1994. Corporate income taxes were especially
strong in June and have risen 12 percent so far this fiscal year;
the June surge may reflect corporations' attempts to comply with the
more stringent safe-harbor provisions instituted last year and thus
avoid underpayment penalties. Federal Reserve earnings have also
been robust, as interest rates have been higher than they were a
year earlier.
Excluding deposit insurance, outlays have been about
5-1/2 percent higher than during the comparable period of fiscal
1994. The main restraint continues to come from defense, which is
4. CBO is expected to release its summer update of the economic
and budget outlook in late August. This deficit estimate is taken
from CBO Director O'Neill's statement to the House Budget Committee
on August 3. She also indicated that CBO is lowering its projection
of the baseline deficit for 1996 but does not anticipate significant
changes in the projections for subsequent years.

down nearly 4 percent in nominal terms. By contrast, outlays
for Medicare and Medicaid, which had appeared to be slowing earlier
in the year, have picked up in recent months, and they now show a
year-to-date increase of 10 percent, similar to trend over the past
couple of years. In addition, net interest outlays were 15 percent
higher than over the comparable period of fiscal 1994.
Looking ahead, the Administration now expects the deficit to
edge up to $163 billion in fiscal 1996 and $179 billion in fiscal
1997 but to fall thereafter as the President's proposals push the
budget toward balance in fiscal 2004. This projection also
incorporates the fiscal 1995 rescissions package, other legislation
enacted since February, and revised economic and technical
assumptions. The main change to the economic assumptions is in
interest rates, which have been lowered considerably in the near
term in response to recent developments in financial markets. In
addition, OMB assumes that adoption of the President's plan would
result in a sizable decrease in interest rates over the next ten
years; this reduction in interest rates, in turn, results in
substantially lower outlays for debt service--this is similar to the
"fiscal dividend" that plays a key role in financing the tax cuts in
the congressional budget plan.
The Administration expects to achieve a balanced budget by
early next century with a much smaller package of budget cuts than
the one proposed in the congressional budget resolution. That
5. Real defense purchases in the NIPA fell at only a 2 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, compared with an average decline
of about 6 percent over the preceding three years. Real nondefense
purchases, which are also somewhat erratic on a quarterly basis,
have been essentially flat over the past year.
6. The fiscal 1995 rescissions bill, which the President signed
into law on July 27 after initially vetoing it, cancelled budget
authority of about $16 billion, whereas it increased emergency and
other supplemental budget authority by about $8 billion. CBO
estimates that the net reduction in budget authority translates into
lower outlays of about $3 billion in fiscal 1996 and $1 billion in
fiscal 1997.

expectation hinges importantly on OMB's more optimistic path for the
deficit in the absence of policy changes. In particular, OMB
projects that the baseline deficit will rise only gradually over the
next several years and will reach a level of only about $235 billion
in fiscal 2004, whereas CBO's projected baseline deficit, which
underlies the budget resolution, exceeds $400 billion in that year.
The divergence between the OMB and CBO baselines arises for
several reasons. First, OMB's economic assumptions are more
favorable than CBO's. In particular, OMB projects marginally faster
real GDP growth, and it projects that the gap between the increases
in the CPI and the GDP deflator will be noticeably smaller than in
the past few years. (All else equal, a smaller gap between the two
inflation measures will hold down the deficit because the CPI is
used to index benefit programs and tax brackets, whereas the GDP
deflator affects estimates of nominal income and hence the tax
base.) In addition, OMB is slightly more optimistic about the
outlook for health spending and other mandatory outlays under
current policies, and its smaller projected deficits help to hold
down outlays for net interest. The individual differences in the
assumptions underlying the two baselines are not large, but they are
sufficient to produce marked discrepancies in the longer-run budget
projections.
The 1996 budget process is likely to extend well into the
fourth quarter. Although the House has passed eleven of the
thirteen appropriations bills that provide funding for discretionary
spending programs, the Senate has passed only six, and a House-
Senate conference has completed action on only one. In addition,
the reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution do not
require the committees responsible for mandatory spending programs
to submit recommendations to the budget committees until

September 22, and the budget committee chairmen have hinted at the
prospect of a delay.
State and Local Government Sector
Growth in purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments remained moderate in the second quarter. Real employee
compensation rose only 0.4 percent at an annual rate, checked by
tepid growth in employment. State and local employment edged down
in July and rose just 10,000 per month, on average, over the first
seven months of the year, compared with an average gain of about
25,000 per month in 1993 and 1994. After taking into account the
construction data for May and June (which were not available for the
advance GDP estimate), real construction spending appears to have
risen at about a 5 percent annual rate in the second quarter; these
outlays have bounced around from quarter to quarter but have shown
little net change over the past couple of years.
Based on early reports from thirty-four states, the National
Conference of State Legislatures indicates that state fiscal
conditions continued strong in fiscal 1995. General fund revenues
of these states increased 6-1/2 percent for the year ending in June,
about twice the rise anticipated at the start of the fiscal year.
General fund spending increased 6-1/4 percent in fiscal 1995, also
above the original forecast of 4-1/2 percent and the largest gain
since 1990. Last year, states spent more than they had planned on
primary and secondary education, corrections, Medicaid, and AFDC,
but less than had been budgeted on higher education.
The states do not expect strong revenue gains to continue.
They forecast that general fund collections will rise just 3 percent
in fiscal 1996. In addition, they anticipate that spending will
grow 4 percent. About half the states expect to cover the spending
growth entirely with current revenues and half expect to use some

reserves. The largest budgeted increase is for corrections, on
which spending is expected to increase 13 percent compared with an
11 percent rise in fiscal 1995.
Labor Costs
Labor costs have remained generally well contained in recent
months despite the relatively low level of the unemployment rate.
The employment cost index (ECI) for private industry workers rose at
a 2.9 percent annual rate from March to June, bringing the rise in
hourly compensation costs over the past year to 2.8 percent, down
from 3.4 percent over the previous twelve-month period. The
deceleration in hourly compensation has occurred mainly in the
benefits component, for which growth slowed to 2.6 percent for the
twelve months ended in June from 3.9 percent over the previous
twelve months. Growth in wages and salaries has held steady at
about 3 percent for nearly two years.
Continued decelerations in health insurance costs and in a
number of legally required benefits have contributed significantly
to the moderation in overall benefit cost growth. Health insurance
costs slowed to a 0.6 percent rate of increase over the twelve-month
period ended in June from 5 percent over the previous twelve months;
as recently as 1991, increases in insurance costs were running in
excess of 10 percent annually. Among legally required benefits, the
slower rate of increase in health care costs along with changes in
many state programs led to a rare decline, of 2-3/4 percent, in
employer costs for workers' compensation over the past year.
Employer contributions to state unemployment insurance funds also
have fallen in recent quarters, reflecting the effects of fewer
layoffs on UI experience ratings.
Among other benefit components, supplemental pay dropped back
in the second quarter after a first-quarter surge that reflected

bonus payments to auto workers. In contrast, employer contributions
to retirement and saving plans rose 8-1/2 percent over the past
year, apparently boosted by continued efforts to raise the funding
levels of defined benefit pension plans.
The deceleration in compensation costs over the past year has
been widespread across occupations and industries. Nearly every
major occupational category within the white-collar and blue-collar
classifications showed some slowing, while compensation growth in
service occupations held steady at about 2-1/2 percent. Among the
major industry categories, there were sharp decelerations in
compensation costs in construction, nondurable manufacturing, and
retail trade, and a more gradual slowing in a number of other
industry sectors. Only transportation and public utilities and
wholesale trade have seen a pickup in compensation growth over the
past year.
A separate measure of hourly compensation available from the
productivity and cost data rose 3.6 percent at an annual rate in the
second quarter and 3.8 percent over the first half of this year,
more than 1 percentage point faster than the ECI. Most of the gap
owes to differences in the growth of benefits; the rise in wages and
salaries per hour is a bit larger when based on the productivity and
cost data, but not strikingly so. The ECI data on benefits tend to
be more reliable in the near term because they are based on an
actual survey of firms whereas benefits in the productivity and cost
data are largely extrapolated from recent trends.
The only information available for the third quarter is the
July reading on average hourly earnings for production or
nonsupervisory workers, which was up 0.6 percent after a 0.4 percent
increase in June. This series has tended to show a larger increase
in the first month of the quarter than in subsequent months for the

last few quarters, and this pattern seems to be continuing into the
third quarter. Nonetheless, over the past twelve months, average
hourly earnings rose 3-1/4 percent, about 1/2 percent more than
during the preceding twelve-month period.
Prices
The incoming news on inflation has continued to be favorable.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in July, and the core CPI
increased just 0.2 percent per month in each of the past three
months--down somewhat from the pace earlier in the year. Falling
used car prices and auto finance charges account for most of this
slowing. For the past three years the rate of increase in the core
CPI has been stable at around a 3 percent annual rate. Price
pressures at earlier stages of processing are now abating as
producer price increases for intermediate goods and crude materials
have dropped back from the rapid pace of earlier this year.
Consumer energy prices dropped 0.8 percent in July after three
months of sizable increases. Both the July decline and the earlier
increases reflected movements of crude oil prices. A further drop
in retail prices is likely in August based on the Lundberg survey of
gasoline prices and the net decline in the spot price of West Texas
intermediate since May. Natural gas prices rose 0.4 percent in July
after falling considerably in the first half of the year partly in
response to mild weather.
Food prices increased 0.2 percent in July after tiny increases
in May and June. In July, the food index was held down by declines
in prices for fresh fruits and vegetables. In particular, lettuce
prices fell sharply for the third consecutive month and have
completely reversed the sharp jump in April caused by the California
floods. Among the other grocery store items, prices were little
changed for meats, poultry, and fish but rose 4 percent for eggs in

July. Prices of food away from home, the largest part of the food
index, increased 2.4 percent in the past twelve months--a bit faster
than its year-earlier increase. Over the past twelve months, the
food index increased 2.7 percent--about the same as during the year-
earlier period.
Prices of consumer goods other than food and energy increased
only 0.1 percent in July and have been unchanged, on balance, over
the past three months. Rapid increases in used car prices boosted
the increase in the consumer goods index early this year, and
falling used car prices have held it down more recently. Under
pressure from high inventories, prices of new motor vehicles were
little changed in the past three months. Another industry that has
been under pressure from excess inventories is apparel, where prices
in July were 2-1/4 percent below year-earlier levels.
The prices of non-energy services have been buffeted by sharp
movements in airfares and automobile finance charges. Airline fares
dropped in July but are still 8 percent above their year-ago level
because of a succession of large increases over the first half of
1995. Auto finance charges have generally followed the path of
interest rates--rising 32 percent over the year ending in April
before falling 6 percent in the past three months. Excluding air
fares and auto finance, inflation of non-energy services has been
stable at about 0.3 percent per month since the beginning of the
year.
In the PPI, price increases among intermediate goods excluding
food and energy have slowed to about 0.2 percent per month, on
average, for the past three months, after rising 8 percent over the
previous twelve months. The PPI for finished goods excluding food
and energy has risen 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, up
from 0.5 percent during the year-earlier period.

Price changes for industrial commodities have been mixed in
recent weeks. Overall, the Journal of Commerce Industrial Price
Index has fallen about 1 percent since the June Greenbook, largely
because of a 3.7 percent drop in its textiles component; the Journal
of Commerce Metals Index increased roughly 2-1/2 percent in the same
period. Aluminum prices rose 8 percent, as stocks in LME warehouses
fell and the stronger ruble pushed up the price of exports from
Russia. Prices for steel scrap are also up from their level at the
time of the last Greenbook: Reports in the trade press indicate
that overseas demand for scrap, especially from South Korea and
Japan, remains strong, and further price increases could be
forthcoming. On the other hand, copper prices, which had surged
earlier this year, have softened a bit recently. Prices for lumber
have increased more than 7 percent since June, although prices are
still relatively low compared with levels seen in the past couple of
years.
In agriculture, the prices of crops have been volatile since
the last Greenbook, moving up and down with changes in traders
perceptions of weather developments and crop conditions. Prices of
grains and soybeans strengthened through much of July in response to
unusually hot weather in several agricultural regions. Toward the
end of July, however, cooler temperatures and timely rains appeared
to translate into some improvement in the condition of these crops,
and prices weakened. The price swings for corn and soybeans
resulted in small net increases from late June to mid-August; wheat
prices fell about 4 percent on net over that same period. Cotton
7. On balance, crop conditions seem to have improved during July.
Based on conditions as of August 1, the USDA raised its forecast of
corn production to 8.12 billion bushels, up about 0.3 billion
bushels from the forecast of a month earlier. The agency's
production estimates for wheat and cotton also were raised somewhat,
and the forecast of soybean output was little changed. Nonetheless,
crop production overall still is expected to be down considerably
from the level of 1994.

prices declined more substantially--about 20 percent in all--as the
size of that crop continued to progress toward a record high. In
the livestock sector, cattle prices dipped further, on net, from
late June to mid-August, but the prices of hogs continued to rise.
Prices of broilers and eggs were pushed sharply higher by the hot
weather of July, which led to reports of increased death losses in
the flocks of some producers; by mid-August, the runup in egg prices
had been largely reversed, but the higher level of broiler prices
was persisting.
Surveys of expected inflation in consumer prices have been
roughly stable over the past two years--a pattern that echoes the
path of the total CPI. But whereas the CPI has fluctuated around
3 percent, the inflation surveys have been stable at higher expected
rates. Both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board
surveys of one-year expectations are hovering around 4 percent,
while the Livingston survey (of one-year expectations) and the
professional forecasters survey (of ten-year expectations) are
holding at 3-1/2 percent.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The announcement on July 6 of the FOMC's decision to trim the
intended federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5-3/4 percent,
pushed Treasury yields down that day about 15 basis points at the
short end and nearly as much at long maturities. Subsequently,
however, economic reports began to show a stronger cast to economic
activity, evidently leading market participants to project a pickup
in credit demands and much less chance for further near-term policy
easing by the Federal Reserve. These perceptions seemed to be
reinforced by the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in mid-July,
which was widely seen as suggesting that the Federal Reserve saw
economic conditions firming faster than many had anticipated. On
balance, the Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeting
period, with bill yields beyond the three-month maturity up as much
as 21 basis points and longer-term yields up 30 to 40 basis points.
Despite higher interest rates, favorable corporate earnings
surprises pushed most broad indexes of stock prices moderately
higher. Small company indexes, led by technology issues, climbed as
much as 7-1/2 percent.
Aggregate credit demands appear to have eased a bit recently.
The flurry of corporate bond issuance during May and June was cut
short last month by the backup in long-term bond yields. Short-term
borrowing by businesses strengthened in July but was considerably
below the pace recorded earlier in the year. Household borrowing
appears to have maintained its recent rate, while the debt of state
and local governments continued to decline, primarily reflecting
retirements of bonds that had been refunded in advance. Treasury
borrowing needs in the third quarter are sizable, and funding late
in the quarter may well be complicated by potential debt-ceiling
limitations.

Maturity in years
Credit supply conditions have generally remained favorable.
Spreads on corporate debt over Treasuries narrowed over the
intermeeting period, and banks report that they remained quite
willing lenders. Indeed, although total bank credit growth was
weak, reflecting run-offs of securities, bank loans expanded
briskly.
The broad monetary aggregates continued to register strong
growth in July, led by increases in money funds and time deposits.
M1 growth, however, remained weak and likely will come under
continued downward pressure as more banks introduce OCD sweep
programs.

III-3
Depository Credit and Monetary Aggregates
Bank credit growth slowed to a 3-3/4 percent pace last month,
as strong loan growth was partly offset by a decline in trading
account securities. On balance, bank securities holdings have been
about flat this year. As a result, the ratio of bank securities to
total assets has declined but remains at a relatively high level
(chart, page 6).
The pickup in bank lending last month was concentrated largely
in real estate and business lending. Banks evidently continue to
seek new lending opportunities: Although the August Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey showed little further easing of standards, a
substantial number of banks reported narrower spreads of loan rates
over base rates for loans to middle-market and large firms. Few
banks reported increased willingness to make consumer loans, but
this stability followed an extended period of aggressive pursuit of
such loans. Consumer loan growth--at 8-1/4 percent in July--was off
somewhat from the pace earlier in the year. Adjusted for
securitizations, however, consumer lending remained brisk at 14-1/2
percent.
Assets at thrift institutions are estimated to have edged up
over the first half of the year. The expansion of thrift credit
going forward, however, could be affected by the FDIC's recent
decision to cut deposit insurance premiums for BIF-insured
institutions from an average of 23.2 basis points to an average of
4.4 basis points--a move expected to reduce the banking industry's
costs by an estimated $4-1/2 billion annually. Deposit
1. Under the previous risk-based deposit insurance premium
schedule, premiums had ranged from 23 to 31 basis points depending
on the financial condition of the institution. With a large
proportion of banks now quite well capitalized, most institutions
were paying 23 basis points. The new premium schedule will range
from 4 to 31 basis points, with most institutions again expected to
fall in the lowest premium category.

insurance premiums for SAIF-insured institutions (mostly savings and
loans, and savings banks) were not changed, and industry
representatives have argued that the BIF-SAIF premium disparity will
put SAIF-insured institutions at a significant disadvantage in
2competition with banks. Indeed, the market rendered its
assessment of the situation shortly after the FDIC's announcement:
Bank stock prices climbed appreciably while share prices for many
thrifts edged lower.
Despite the sluggish advance of bank credit in July, the broad
monetary aggregates registered continued strong growth. M3 expanded
at an 8-1/2 percent pace last month, placing its level well above
the upper bound of its revised annual range of 2 percent to
6 percent. Moreover, preliminary data available for August suggest
that M3 growth is continuing at about the pace in July. Increases
in large time deposits and institution-only money funds were
especially notable. Yields on institution-only money funds tend to
lag changes in money market interest rates and so became quite
attractive to investors following the easing of policy in July. The
rise in large time deposits appeared to be associated with stronger
loan growth at banks and a decline in banks' reliance on borrowing
from their overseas branches last month.
M2 increased at a 5-3/4 percent rate in July, down considerably
from its torrid growth in June but still quite brisk. Early data
for the month of August suggest that M2 continues to expand rapidly,
perhaps at a rate somewhat above that of July. A very large portion
of the recent rise in M2 has been associated with a steep climb in
retail money funds (chart). As money fund yields have become more
2. At recent congressional hearings on the insurance premium
issue, the Treasury, FDIC, and OTS proposed a joint plan to merge
the BIF and SAIF funds and to assess a one-time charge on SAIF-
insured institutions. In his testimony, Chairman Greenspan
supported a merger of BIF and SAIF.

attractive relative to both short- and long-term yields, money funds
appear to have drawn flows that in earlier months were directed to
market instruments outside M2. Indeed, net noncompetitive tenders
for Treasury bills and bonds at recent auctions have slowed to a
trickle from the very high levels recorded earlier in the year.
The strength of M2 in June and July does not appear to have
come at the expense of bond and stock mutual funds. The growth of
M2 plus stock and bond funds in both months, for example, is
estimated to have exceeded M2 growth by a considerable margin.
Flows into stock mutual funds were quite strong in July, and net
sales of bond mutual funds picked up as well (table).
In contrast to the broader aggregates, M1 remained rather
weak--expanding at a 1-1/2 percent rate in July--with declines in
currency and other checkable deposits largely offsetting
considerable growth in demand deposits. The sudden weakness in

currency growth over the last two months appears to have been
associated with a drop in overseas demands for U.S. currency, as
financial conditions in some key countries where dollars are widely
used have become more stable. In particular, currency reflows from
Argentina and softer demand for dollars in Russia are thought to
account for much of the currency weakness. OCDs have been declining
for some time, reflecting both the wide opportunity costs of holding
OCD balances and the introduction of sweep-account arrangements by
some large banks. Recently, two more large institutions have
introduced OCD sweep programs, and it seems likely that others will
follow. These accounts have no impact on M2 because OCD balances
are swept into MMDAs. However, they do lower the level of
transaction balances in M1 and required reserves. The sweep
accounts introduced this year have dropped the level of OCD by about
$15 billion and required reserves by about $1.5 billion.
Business Finance
Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations in July slowed from a
brisk second-quarter pace (chart), perhaps reflecting some reduction
in overall borrowing needs and a lull in long-term borrowing after
the surge in bond issuance in May and June. Corporate bond issuance
fell in July in concert with the backup in long-term interest rates.
In contrast, commercial paper outstanding moved up further over the
intermeeting period, but most of the increase reflected a single
large transaction: ITT issued $3 billion of commercial paper late
in July associated with its split into three separate operating
units.
To date, there are few signs of financial stress in the
nonfinancial business sector. Measures of business debt service
burdens (chart) have risen this year but remain well below the peak

levels attained in the late 1980s. Rating agencies have seemed
generally optimistic about corporations' financial health. Indeed,
boosted by upgrades of Ford and General Motors, the value of debt
upgraded by Moody's this year has greatly exceeded the value
downgraded. Financial markets also have appeared to recognize the
generally solid financial condition of businesses: Spreads on
corporate debt securities relative to Treasuries narrowed over the
intermeeting period for both investment-grade and below-investment-
grade securities. Spreads of junk bond yields over Treasuries
narrowed considerably, returning to the vicinity of spreads early in
the year.
The largest corporate merger announced over the intermeeting
period--Disney's $19 billion merger with Capital Cities/ABC--
appeared to take the market by surprise. The Disney deal, which
remains subject to approval by stockholders and the Justice
Department, would be the largest merger transaction since RJR
Nabisco in 1989. The day after the Disney announcement,
Westinghouse announced its long-rumored acquisition of CBS for
$5.2 billion. Both deals will entail significant borrowing, likely
beginning early next year. Board staff expect Disney to raise about
$10 billion in the commercial paper and bond markets to complete its
merger; the remainder of the deal will be structured as a stock
swap. Disney also reportedly plans to repurchase about $5 billion
in stock to reduce the dilution of its shares caused by the merger,
ultimately entailing more borrowing. Bank involvement likely will
be limited to supplying backup lines for Disney's commercial paper
program. In contrast, the Westinghouse/CBS acquisition probably
will be funded through a mixture of asset sales and bank borrowing.
Westinghouse reportedly already has bank commitments for some of the

III-13
necessary funding. The firm is rated speculative-grade and
therefore cannot feasibly access the commercial paper market.
With merger activity expected to result in further sizable
share retirements, the outstanding stock of equity likely will
decline in the third quarter. Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial
corporations declined in July to $3.5 billion, from about $5 billion
in June, but nonetheless remained above the weak pace in 1994 and
early this year. Technology companies continued to take advantage
of their buoyant share prices to raise funds. In July, their equity
issues accounted for more than a third of all funds raised in equity
markets, up significantly from their average over the past eighteen
months. The pace of initial public offerings continued to be strong
in July.
Despite weak economic growth over the second quarter, corporate
earnings reports for the quarter have been a little stronger than
expected, on balance. With about 60 percent of all companies now
having reported, somewhat more than half showed earnings that
exceeded analysts' expectations, while about a third came in below
expectations. Analysts now expect corporate profits (at book value)
to increase 12 percent this year and about 4 percent in 1996.
Municipal Securities
Through July, gross issuance of tax-exempt securities ran
considerably below that of the comparable period last year. The
falloff is largely attributable to a drop in refunding volume from
the elevated pace in early 1994. On net, state and local debt has
continued to contract as many local government units have called
debt that had been refunded in advance. Retirement of advance-
refunded issues is expected to keep the stock of long-term municipal
debt on a downward track for some time to come.

and private purposes.
Tax-exempt yields declined relative to Treasury yields over the
intermeeting period, apparently reflecting the relatively light
supply of new bonds and somewhat stronger demand for tax-exempt
debt. Still, from a longer perspective, the yield ratio remains
high, perhaps as a result of continuing concerns that Congress might
enact tax reforms that would reduce or eliminate tax advantages for
municipal debt (chart). In addition, the financial difficulties of
Orange County, California, have probably boosted tax-exempt yields.
As expected, Orange County technically defaulted on $800
million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in July and early
August. With no other feasible options at hand, bondholders and the
bankruptcy court allowed the county to extend the bonds' maturity
until next summer; rating agencies responded by declaring the debt
in default.
Spillover effects from the Orange County situation have been
most notable for other California issuers. Before the Orange County
bankruptcy, California issuers paid an average rate premium

of approximately 10 basis points at the five-year maturity relative
to a national benchmark for Al-rated issuers. After jumping to 28
basis points last December at the outset of the Orange County
debacle, the premium has retreated somewhat, averaging about 15
basis points this year.
Beyond California, the bankruptcy appears to have heightened
the market's perception of the risks of investing in the tax-exempt
market. Indeed, the average rate spread of noninsured bonds over
similar insured bonds has widened nationally. For example, the
yield spread of single-A general obligation twenty-year debt to
similar insured offerings has widened considerably over the past
year, from 11 to 19 basis points (table). As the required premium
on noninsured bonds has risen, issuers have responded by increasing
their use of credit enhancements; over the first seven months of
this year, insured bonds represented 55 percent of the volume of
long-term municipal issuance, up from 52 percent for all of 1994,
and 47 percent for the period between 1990 and 1993.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury's financing needs are projected to be sizable in
the third quarter; funding to cover the anticipated $44.7 billion
deficit is expected to involve both a $21.3 billion drawdown of the
Treasury's cash balances and $17.5 billion additional net borrowing.
The composition of the Treasury's borrowing during the third
quarter is expected to tilt toward longer maturities. The size of
weekly bill auctions was trimmed in July. While the Treasury may
trim the size of bill auctions a bit further to hold debt
outstanding below the statutory debt ceiling, it will have to raise
sufficient funds to bridge a low point in its cash balance just
before mid-September tax inflows.

Considerable market attention was focused on the Treasury's
midquarter refunding, which involved the record sale of
$42-1/2 billion of three-, ten-, and thirty-year securities. A
previous announcement by the Japanese Ministry of Finance of
accounting changes that seemed designed to encourage Japanese
investors to purchase securities abroad led to widespread
speculation about the likely participation of Japanese bidders in
the auction. In the event, the three-year note auction was
generally perceived to go rather poorly, but the subsequent sale of
ten-year notes and thirty-year bonds generated considerably more
investor interest.
After the issuance of the midquarter refunding securities, the
Treasury's debt subject to statutory limit stood just $31 billion
below the current debt ceiling of $4.9 trillion. A looming budget
impasse between Congress and the Administration combined with a
binding debt ceiling has raised the prospect of a Treasury financing
disruption. Staff projections suggest that under the current
ceiling, the Treasury would not have sufficient cash to meet
obligations beyond mid-November, when a large coupon payment is due.
As yet, market prices for Treasury securities maturing in November
do not suggest that market participants are concerned that the
federal government will default.
Net cash borrowing by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
is off last year's pace but still quite strong--$97 billion at an
annual rate compared with $176 billion of net borrowing last year.
Gross issuance of agency securities, however, has been very heavy
this year. With long-term interest rates declining over much of the
first half, GSEs called large blocks of existing debt and refinanced
with new lower-cost debt. In meeting their funding requirements,
GSEs continue to explore new approaches to tapping world capital

III-19
markets. For example, recent foreign exchan'ge volatility reportedly
has strengthened investor demand for assets denominated in German
marks. Following the lead of the World Bank, both FNMA and the
Federal Home Loan Bank System announced in early August that they
would each issue DM 1 billion ($717 million) of mark-denominated
five-year noncallable global bonds.
Mortgage Markets
Mortgage interest rates tracked the general pattern of other
market interest rates over the intermeeting period. On balance, the
average initial rate on fixed rate mortgages (FRMs) moved up about
20 basis points while contract rates on adjustable-rate mortgages
(ARMs) indexed to one-year Treasuries edged up 5 basis points.
Although the FRM-ARM initial rate spread has widened a little since
early July, it remains quite narrow by historical standards (chart).
Surveys of conventional mortgage applications conducted in the
latter half of July by the Mortgage Bankers Association and by
J.P. Morgan indicate a slight increase in ARM applications as a
share of total home loan applications in recent weeks, but a major
shift in borrower preferences away from FRMs seems unlikely.
With FRMs accounting for the bulk of new mortgage originations,
gross issuance of agency-backed pass-through securities edged up
further in June (chart). Issuance of private-label mortgage-backed
securities picked up in the second quarter but has remained
considerably below the pace of recent years. The volume of agency
collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) outstanding continued
weak in the second quarter. Demand for these securities has
remained subdued after the losses investors incurred on such
instruments during 1994--especially in the highly volatile tranches.
Banks, in particular, have scaled back their holdings of CMOs, and
bank regulators have introduced certain tests for depositories and

others to employ in identifying and screening CMOs with highly
volatile structures.
Broad measures of home mortgage credit quality in the second
quarter are not yet available. Anecdotal reports do not suggest
much deterioration in mortgage loan performance generally, although
one niche of the market has experienced rising delinquency rates.
Delinquencies have moved up for loans originated through various
affordable housing programs that employ more lenient underwriting
guidelines to qualify low- and moderate-income households. To date,
lenders have not taken steps to scale back the affordable housing
loan programs introduced in recent years. However, some industry
participants have recommended that the expanded underwriting
guidelines of these programs be supplemented with additional credit
review techniques, including credit scoring.
Consumer Credit
Total consumer installment credit advanced at about a 12
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in June--a little below the
pace over much of the first half of the year. Growth of auto loans
slowed a bit from May but remained above the first-quarter pace,
evidently reflecting sales incentives offered by many dealers trying
to pare inventories. Growth of revolving credit moved down in June
but remained quite brisk at close to a 20 percent annual rate.
On average for the second quarter, the growth rate of
installment credit moderately exceeded the first-quarter pace but
stayed within the rather narrow range of 13 percent to 15 percent
prevailing since the second quarter of last year. On the whole,
installment credit has expanded less vigorously during the current
economic upswing than is typical in this stage of the business cycle
(chart). In the past, consumer credit growth generally began to
climb sharply in the earliest stages of the economic upturn and at

some point reached peak rates of close to 20 percent. In the
current expansion, consumer credit growth remained sluggish for
several quarters after the upturn began, primarily reflecting an
unusually slow pickup in spending on durable goods. When spending
strengthened in late 1993 and into 1994, consumer borrowing picked
up substantially as well, though not quite reaching the highest
growth rates of past periods. Further increases in durables
expenditures have been limited this year, but spending levels
apparently are high enough to generate loan originations still well
in excess of loan repayments, so that the stock of consumer debt has
continued to grow relatively rapidly.
Preliminary data indicate that household debt service burdens
edged higher in the second quarter (chart) but remain below the peak
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1989. Scheduled payments of
principal and interest on the stock of outstanding home mortgage
debt have climbed a bit relative to income, reflecting somewhat
higher rates last year on fixed-rate mortgages and upward
adjustments this year to rates on adjustable-rate loans. Debt
service payments for consumer credit relative to income have risen
more sharply, consistent with the substantial increases in consumer
credit recorded over the past several quarters and, more recently,
some increase in the average interest rates paid on the stock of
consumer debt.

In May, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was the same as
the revised April deficit. Exports rebounded sharply from their fall in
April. Imports rose again in May at about the same rate as in April. For
April-May combined, the deficit (at an annual rate) was significantly
larger than in the first quarter. Data for June will be released August
17 and reported in the Greenbook supplement.

The level of exports of goods and services for April-May
combined was higher on average than in the first quarter. Increases
in exports of aircraft, machinery excluding computers, and
industrial supplies more than offset the decline in exported
agricultural products and automotive products. The change in
exports was largely in quantity; the exception was exports of
industrial supplies, where virtually all of the increase was in
price. By area, the rise in merchandise exports in April-May
combined was led by exports to Western Europe and Canada.
Imports of goods and services in April-May combined grew 4
percent from their level in the first quarter, somewhat above the
rate of increase recorded in the first quarter. Imports rose in all
major import categories, except foods. By area, the rise in

merchandise imports was concentrated in Western Europe, Canada,
Japan, and Asian LDCs.
The total quantity of oil imported in May rose sharply,
despite a fall in consumption, due to seasonal inventory
accumulation. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate
that in June imports posted another substantial rise as a result of
a pick-up in consumption. Thus, while the quantity of imports for
April-May combined was a bit below that in the first quarter, we
expect second-quarter imports to have posted a modest gain.
The price of imported oil rose about $0.70 per barrel in May,
mostly reflecting the influence of a tight gasoline market in the
United States and the Brazilian oil workers' strike. However, oil
prices worldwide fell sharply in June as the strike in Brazil was
called off, as statements by OPEC officials implied higher impending
OPEC production, and as fear of lower U.S. oil demand increased.
Spot WTI continued to fall in July on perceptions of abundant
supply, averaging $17.30 per barrel, compared with the second-
quarter average of $19.35 per barrel. Currently, spot WTI is
trading around $17.35 per barrel.
Prices of Merchandise Non-oil Imports and Exports
The prices of U.S. non-oil imports fell 0.1 percent in June,
led by a decline in the prices for foods and industrial supplies.
During the second quarter as a whole, the rate of increase in import
prices rose above the first-quarter rate, returning to the pace seen
in the second half of last year. Higher prices for imports in other
categories were partially offset by lower prices for imported foods
and computers.
The prices of U.S. exports in June rose modestly, as higher
prices for exported agricultural products overwhelmed the fall in
prices of exported industrial supplies and computers. In the second
quarter, the prices of exported goods rose almost as sharply as in

the first quarter. Most of the increase was associated with prices
of exported agricultural products and industrial supplies.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Increases in foreign official assets in the United States were
very large in the second quarter, as were private foreign purchases
of U.S. securities, particularly Treasury securities. These capital
inflows were partially offset by strong growth in U.S. net purchases
of foreign securities and large outflows reported by banks.
Foreign official inflows increased substantially during the
second quarter (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table), and partial data from the FRBNY indicate that
substantial inflows continued in July. Early in the second quarter,
G-10 intervention in the foreign exchange market (by Japan in
particular) accounted for most of the increase in foreign official
holdings in the United States. Subsequently, the marked increase in
official holdings in May and June was concentrated in Russia and
non-OPEC developing countries in Asia and Latin America. Throughout
the quarter. Russian official dollar holdings in the United States
rose as Russia purchased dollars to stem the appreciation of the
ruble and received IMF disbursements. Despite press reports to the
contrary, the U.S. data do not suggest that Asian nations
diversified their foreign official holdings away from U.S. dollars
in either the first or second quarters of 1995. Moreover, one Asian
country added more than $3 billion to its holdings of U.S. corporate
equities during the second quarter.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities were very
strong in the second quarter, particularly in May and June (line 4).
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries continued at the
rapid first-quarter rate (line 4a). Japan accounted for almost half
of these net purchases, but sizeable purchases were also recorded by
the United Kingdom and Caribbean financial centers. During the

second quarter, foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate and
agency bonds were most pronounced in May and June. New Eurobond
issues by U.S. corporations remained strong in July. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. stocks in the second quarter were positive, in
contrast with net sales of U.S. equities by foreigners in the
previous two quarters.
U.S. private net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) rose
dramatically in June, continuing the strong rise recorded in May.
U.S. interest in both foreign stocks and bonds was markedly greater
than during the weak first quarter. U.S. net purchases of foreign
bonds were concentrated in Europe and Canada, while purchases of
foreign equities were concentrated in Europe and Japan. U.S.
investors continued to show only limited interest in securities of
most emerging markets.
Banks and securities dealers reported a large net capital
outflow again in the second quarter (line 3). About one-third of
the outflow was accounted for by RP transactions by securities
dealers and may have contributed to the financing of large purchases
of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners during this period. Most
of the remainder of the net capital outflow was concentrated on the
books of foreign-based banks. Monthly average data on the net
claims of U.S. banking offices on their own foreign offices and IBFs
(line 1 of the International Banking Data table) show a smaller net
outflow in the second quarter, but also indicate that banks in the
United States stopped financing their asset expansion through
borrowing from abroad.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average dollar has risen more than 5 percent, on net,
since the July FOMC meeting. The dollar rose as economic data showed
stronger U.S. economic activity than had been expected, U.S. long-term
interest rates rose relative to European interest rates, and central
banks bought dollars in several episodes of concerted intervention.
The dollar rose most sharply against the yen, gaining about 15
percent. In part, the dollar's rise against the yen may be seen as a
reversal of the sharp yen rise during the first half of the year that
seemed much greater than could be justified by fundamental factors. The
dollar's recent rise against the yen centered on three days. On July 7,
the Bank of Japan lowered its call money rate nearly 50 basis points to
just above 3/4 percent, below the official discount rate of 1 percent.
On August 2, the Japanese government announced regulatory changes
designed to encourage capital outflow from Japan. On both days, the Bank
of Japan purchased dollars in Tokyo (extremely heavily on August 2) and
the FRBNY Foreign Exchange Desk intervened in New York for U.S. accounts
On August 15
the Desk
intervened to buy dollars against both marks and yen
.The Japanese policy actions, together
with the concerted intervention, may have been taken as a signal that the
Japanese government is committed to a weaker yen and that it is prepared
to take more substantial monetary policy measures to lower the yen's
value if these measures do not succeed. However, the yen's recent
decline has contributed to a 65 basis point rise in Japanese bond yields
and an erosion of expectations for further monetary easing as embodied in
Euroyen futures rates. Japanese stock price indexes rose about 20
percent during the intermeeting period, boosted by the depreciation of
the yen.

The dollar has gained nearly 7 percent against the German mark
since the July FOMC meeting as German bond yields declined and Euromark
futures came to imply a small further easing in the Bundesbank's RP rate
beyond the 5 basis point reduction that took place last week. Subdued
German inflation data for July made June's uptick look more like an
aberration while money supply growth has remained below target.
Other European currencies have recovered against the mark, so that
the dollar has risen less than 5 percent against the French franc, less
than 3 percent against sterling, and less than 1 percent against the
Italian lira. The gains of the peripheral European currencies relative
to the mark are in part a recovery from earlier declines that were linked
to political uncertainty or a general defensive shift into the mark. The
French franc has now recovered what it lost in the runup to the French
presidential election, even as French three-month interest rates were
allowed to decline 65 basis points. The Italian lira has been helped by
the passage of legislation to reform the pension system and by
speculation that the Italian government may push for re-entry of the lira
into the exchange rate mechanism as early as October.
The lira had fallen as
low as 1260 per mark in April.
The Mexican peso is about unchanged on net since the July FOMC
meeting, and has settled into a narrow range of 6.10 to 6.20 for the past
several weeks. Short-term cetes interest rates have declined about 5
percentage points to 35 percent. The ability of Mexican banks to raise
funds at progressively lower interest rates has led to the repayment of
most of the dollars borrowed by banks through the Bank of Mexico's

IV-13
FOBAPROA window. Repayments of more than $1 billion since the July
meeting have reduced outstanding FOBAPROA loans to about $200 million,
down from an April peak of nearly $4 billion.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries
appears to be proceeding at a fairly sluggish pace, particularly in
Japan, where monthly data on industrial production, housing starts, and
machinery orders all fell during the second quarter. In Canada, recent
data suggest that economic activity stagnated in the second quarter, and
July marked the eighth consecutive month in which the level of employment
remained relatively unchanged. Economic activity in the major European
economies seems to be advancing a bit faster. Reliable German economic
indicators are sparse, but on balance, point to continued moderate
expansion. In France, recent production data are weak, but consumption
expenditures surged in the second quarter owing to temporary subsidies
on automobile purchases. Italian industrial production expanded in the
second quarter, but overall growth probably moderated from its very
strong first-quarter pace. In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth slowed
a bit in the second quarter owing to weaker oil production.
Consumer price inflation has slowed in most of the major foreign
industrial countries, in part as a result of lower oil prices. In July,
consumer prices fell in Japan to a level about 1/4 percent below their
year-earlier level. Consumer prices also fell in western Germany and
France, bringing 12-month inflation rates to 2-1/4 percent and 1-1/2
percent, respectively. Inflation remained low in Germany and even lower
in France. Consumer price inflation continued to edge up in the United
Kingdom in June to about 2-3/4 percent, but moderated somewhat in Canada.
Owing to lower prices for food and energy, Italian consumer price
inflation receded somewhat in July, but remained above 5-1/2 percent.
Individual country notes. Second-quarter indicators for Japan
point to continued weakness in private-sector activity. Industrial

IV-14
production, housing starts, and new machinery orders all fell in May,
although new machinery orders were 10 percent above their year-ago
level. In June, industrial production contracted again. The
unemployment rate has remained at its post-war high of 3.2 percent since
April, but the job offers/applicants ratio continued to decline in June,
suggesting further deterioration in the labor market. One positive
indicator is the number of new car registrations, which continued to
recover in June.

Japanese consumer prices fell in July to a level 0.2 percent below
year-earlier levels. After falling for 5 consecutive months, wholesale
prices rose 0.2 percent in July. Wholesale prices of domestic goods were
flat, but imported goods prices rose 0.4 percent, partly as a result of
the recent reversal of some of yen's depreciation over the past year.
Despite a sharp increase in the merchandise trade surplus, the
Japanese current account balance declined slightly in June to just under
$11 billion. For the first six months of 1995 the current account
surplus was $61 billion (SAAR), down from $68 billion last year. In

IV- 15
July, the merchandise trade surplus dropped sharply to $8.1 billion,
compared to $11.1 billion in July 1994.
Prime Minister Murayama's cabinet recently endorsed an increase of
up to 4.2 percent in general budget expenditures for the upcoming fiscal
year that is designed to spur economic recovery. Finance Minister
Takemura also reaffirmed the government's intention to pass a second
supplementary budget for the current fiscal year.
Failure of a large Tokyo credit union (Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai) created
potential for a major financial market disturbance. However, efforts by
the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Japan, and the Tokyo government to
provide funding and assurances that authorities were dealing
effectively with problems in Japanese financial markets were received
well and appear to have contained the crisis.
In Germany, limited available evidence suggests that the expansion
is continuing, although at a slower pace than last year. Industrial
production rose 1.3 percent in the second quarter following a sharp
first-quarter decline that in part was a result of a recent change-over
in statistical methods. Almost all of the second-quarter increase in
production occurred in April; production was flat in May and declined in
June. Retail sales also showed a mild improvement this spring after
weakness in the first quarter, when demand probably was depressed by the
reimposition of the solidarity income tax. However, sales stalled in May
and dropped in June. The labor market remains stagnant; the west German
unemployment rate edged back up to 8.3 percent in June and remained at
that level in July. Improvement in the labor market in eastern Germany
appears to have stalled as well, as the unemployment rate has been little
changed since late last year. In contrast, capacity utilization in the
west German manufacturing sector has continued to increase, and is now
almost 3 percentage points above its previous fifteen-year average.

Forward-looking indicators are mixed. Data on new orders for
manufactured goods were a little more than 1 percent above the first-
quarter level on average in April and May. The improvement was more than
accounted for by domestic orders, as foreign orders fell. At the same
time, firms have become noticeably less optimistic about future
prospects since the beginning of the year, with the net percentage of
firms expecting to increase production in the next three months turning
slightly negative in June for the first time since the end of 1993.
Consumer price inflation on a year-over-year basis averaged 2.3
percent in the first and second quarter, and after a slight uptick in
June, returned to that level in July. The appreciation of the DM earlier
this year had a beneficial impact on import prices that has helped to
offset the impact of wage acceleration.
The German cabinet approved a draft of the 1996 budget on July 5
that includes a 5-1/2 percent reduction in expenditures, largely as a
result of the partial transfer of family assistance programs to states
and municipalities. On balance, however, the draft budget entails an__

IV-17
increase in the budget deficit because of court-ordered tax cuts that are
also included.
In France, available monthly indicators for the second and third
quarters are mixed. The average level of industrial production in April
and May was roughly unchanged from the level in the first quarter.
Capacity utilization remained constant in the second quarter, at a level
well below its recent cyclical peak. However, employment continued to
increase in the second quarter, contributing to a decline in the
unemployment rate. Surveys of business confidence taken in July and
August suggest output growth has been modest this summer.

Consumption of manufactured products rose sharply in the second
quarter, but this increase was entirely due to a surge in automobile
purchases before the end-of-June expiration of government incentives to
purchase cars.
Consumer prices fell in July, causing a slight decline in the 12-
month rate of inflation. However, the rise in the VAT that took effect
August 1 is expected to boost the consumer price index by 0.9 percent.
Hourly wages in the second quarter were 2.8 percent above their year-
earlier level after rising 2.6 percent in the first quarter. Moreover,

IV-18
the 4 percent rise in the French minimum wage on July 1 is likely to
contribute to a further pick up in wage inflation in the third quarter.
Second-quarter data for the United Kingdom suggest a continued
moderate pace of growth. Real GDP rose a preliminary 2.3 percent (SAAR),
while GDP excluding oil and gas extraction rose 2.7 percent. Industrial
production was little changed due to the decline in oil and gas
extraction, although manufacturing output expanded 0.4 percent. Retail
sales rose 0.3 percent after falling in the first quarter, and were up
0.6 percent from their second-quarter average level in July.
Unemployment stabilized during the second quarter at 8.3 percent and
remained at that rate in July. Production plans (revealed in business
surveys) have fallen from their first-quarter peak but were fairly
strong in July. Consumer confidence (NSA) dropped to its lowest level in
2-1/2 years in the second quarter but improved somewhat in July.

After rising rapidly from a low of 2 percent in October 1994,
consumer price inflation has remained fairly stable this year. In June,
targeted inflation, measured as the 12-month change in retail prices
excluding mortgage interest payments, was 2.8 percent. Although
producer input prices have risen considerably this year, their growth

IV-19
has slowed somewhat recently, while average earnings inflation has
remained steady. In addition, expectations of price increases in the CBI
survey have fallen back considerably since their peak in January.
In Italy, first-quarter GDP rose 6.1 percent (SAAR) as a result of
an exceptionally large rise in exports of goods and services. Final
domestic demand was about flat and inventories made a large negative
contribution. These data should be regarded as preliminary and are
likely to be revised substantially--as has occurred in past quarters.
The new system for collecting data on intra-EU trade, in which data are
derived from VAT forms rather than custom posts, has made export and
import data much less reliable.

continuing, although probably at a more moderate pace. Industrial

Year-over-year inflation slowed in July owing to declines in food
and gasoline prices following a sharp acceleration in the second
quarter. However, the 12-month rise in consumer prices excluding food
and energy was 5.8 percent in July. The second-quarter increase in
inflation reflects the large increases in intermediate goods prices that
resulted from the dip in the value of the lira earlier this year. Wage
inflation has not increased significantly and was 2.8 percent on a year-
over-year basis in the second quarter.
On August 4, the Italian parliament approved a reform of the
Italian pension system that is projected to save $60 billion over 10
years. The reform gradually shifts the system from one in which pensions
are based on earnings to one in which they are based on contributions. It
also gradually increases to 40 the number of years that a person must
work to retire on a full pension.
After a sharp deceleration in the first quarter, economic activity
in Canada remained weak. Industrial production and retail sales picked
up in April and May, but on average were little changed from the first
quarter. Manufacturing shipments and new orders fell in June, reversing
slight gains made in May; second-quarter average levels were below their
first-quarter levels. Housing starts fell again in July to their lowest

IV-21
level since September 1982. Employment declined slightly in July, the
eighth consecutive month with little change in employment. Business
confidence declined sharply in the second quarter, while the index of
consumer attitudes remained well below pre-recession levels. Consumer
price inflation fell in June, in part as a result of lower prices for
durable goods and gasoline.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in Mexico and Argentina contracted considerably
in the second quarter, and growth appears to have slowed in Brazil.
Growth has remained strong in the major Asian developing countries,
although the pace has moderated recently in some cases. In Russia, the
decline in economic activity continued to abate.
In Mexico and Argentina, strong export growth during the first half
of 1995 partly offset the contraction in domestic demand. In Brazil,
import growth was extremely high, reflecting purchases in anticipation
of a possible collapse of the fixed exchange rate policy. Both exports
and imports grew rapidly in the Asian developing countries.
Over the intermeeting period, financial conditions improved in
Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil, perhaps reflecting reduced concerns in
the latter two countries about the sustainability of their fixed
exchange rate policies. Stock market prices rose 20 percent in Argentina
and 10 percent in Brazil. In Mexico, stock prices rose 14 percent in
local currency, and 20 percent in dollar terms. Stripped spreads on
Brady par bonds decreased about 80 basis points in Argentina, 100 basis
points in Mexico, and 160 basis points in Brazil.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, economic activity contracted
significantly in the second quarter. Late August 15, the Mexican
government announced that real GDP fell 10.5 percent in the second
quarter on a year-over-year basis, a steeper decline than what the
government had previously indicated. The components of Q2 real GDP have
not yet been released. The weakening of economic activity, along with
the recent stability of the peso in foreign exchange markets, has
supported the continued decline of monthly consumer price inflation.
Mexico's net export performance has remained strong. Over the
first half of 1995, exports were 33 percent above their year-earlier
level, while imports were down 6 1/2 percent.

On July 10, Mexico sold $1 billion in United Mexican States (UMS)
two-year notes, the first offering by Mexico's central government since
the devaluation. The notes carry a floating interest rate of 5-3/8
percent over LIBOR and are exchangeable for capital in Mexican banks
seeking recapitalization or for shares in companies being privatized.
The amount of the offering initially was set at $500 million, but was
doubled in response to heavy demand. Mexico subsequently issued about
$570 million in yen-denominated UMS three-year notes on July 26.
Mexico violated its end-June performance criteria under its IMF
program for both net international reserves (NIR) and net domestic
assets (NDA) .However, these violations reflected the use of reserves--
including drawings on the IMF--to retire Tesobonos rather than
stimulatory domestic credit expansion. Therefore, on June 30 the IMF's
Executive Board agreed to grant Mexico a waiver, clearing the way for a
$2 billion IMF disbursement in the first week of July, along with a $2.5
billion drawing on the U.S. Treasury's ESF. In mid-August, Mexico became
eligible for a further $1.7 billion disbursement from the IMF, based on
successful compliance with new end-July criteria for NDA and NIR
approved by the Executive Board on June 30. As a result of drawings on
official lines of credit, improved access to private capital markets,

IV-27
and strong trade performance, Mexico's gross international reserves
rose from $6.9 billion at end-March 1995 to $13.3 billion as of August 4.
In Brazil, mounting evidence suggests that economic activity has
slowed in recent months. Industrial output (s.a.) fell sharply in May
1995, owing mostly to temporary disruptions accompanying the oil
workers' strike, but anecdotal accounts suggest that activity has not
fully recovered since then. Monthly inflation has remained relatively
low. In late July and early August, the Central Bank reduced the
overnight interest rate from 61 percent to 57 percent and eased credit
controls in response to the slowdown in economic activity.

Brazil continued to record trade deficits through June. Over the
first half of 1995, exports rose by 5 percent while imports nearly
doubled.
In June and July, large net private capital inflows and the
issuance of $1.6 billion in Central Bank Euroyen and Euromark bonds
raised international reserves substantially, reaching $41 billion
(liquidity concept) at the end of July. Strong net capital inflows
prompted the Central Bank in August to reimpose several restrictions on
capital inflows.
On August 11, the Central Bank took over Banco Economico, Brazil's
eighth largest commercial bank, and two other banks. This brings the

IV-28
number of banks taken over since the start of the stabilization program
to 21 out of a total of 250 banks. The Central Bank stated that Banco
Economico's takeover was aimed at ensuring the liquidity of the
financial system. However, the takeovers are symptomatic of underlying
problems in the banking system. When Banco Economico reopens for
business on August 18, withdrawals will be limited to $5,300.
Some progress towards economic reform was made with the
privatizations of Esclesa, a power distributor, in July, and Copene, a
petrochemical producer, in August. Also, in early August, the Senate
approved constitutional amendments opening the transportation and
natural gas sectors to direct foreign investment and ending the
government's monopoly on telecommunications.
In Argentina, economic activity contracted in the second quarter.
The unemployment rate reached a record level in May 1995. The fall in
economic activity contributed to a rapid turnaround in Argentina's trade
deficit. In the first half of 1995, exports rose by 44.5 percent over a
year earlier while imports declined by 6.5 percent. Consumer price
inflation remained low.

Argentina's fiscal situation remains difficult, particularly in
some provinces, where fiscal austerity measures and delays in salary and

IV-29
pension payments to public employees led to riots in late June. In early
August, the Menem administration announced a package aimed at reducing
unemployment that includes controversial cuts in employers'
contributions to social security programs.
Almost half of the roughly $8 billion in deposits that fled the
Argentine banking system in the aftermath of the Mexican peso crisis has
returned. Of the twelve financial institutions that were forced to
suspend operations, five are undergoing liquidation, and the rest have
been acquired by other banks. Argentina returned to international
capital markets in July, for the first time since the Mexican peso
crisis, when it issued a DM 1 billion five-year Eurobond at a 9.25
percent coupon rate. The money will be used to buy back public debt.
Gross international reserves stood at $15 billion as of August 2, of
which $2 billion are in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds. The monetary
base was $12 billion, leaving $3 billion in excess reserves.
In China, real GDP growth slowed somewhat, and consumer price
inflation continued a downward trend. Analysts attribute the fall in
inflation to good weather, leading to smaller increases in food prices,
and to price controls; all money and credit aggregates showed rapid
growth.

China' s trade surplus widened in the first half of 1995, as exports
rose 44 percent and imports rose 15 percent relative to the first half of
1994. Foreign direct investment in China was $16 billion, up slightly
from the year earlier. Foreign-exchange reserves rose considerably in
the first half of 1995, reaching $62 billion at the end of June.
In Taiwan, the growth of industrial production slowed in the second
quarter from a rapid rate in the first quarter. In the first seven months
of 1995, the trade surplus was down slightly from the same period in
1994: exports rose 23 percent from a year earlier, while imports rose 26
percent.

Two banking scandals hit Taiwan in early August, shaking financial
markets. The currency depreciated 3 percent against the dollar, and the
stock market fell 14 percent during the first week of August. Since then,
however, financial markets appear to have stabilized.
Real economic activity in Korea continued to expand briskly during
the second quarter of 1995, while consumer price inflation remained
relatively low. Rapid growth has been accompanied by a substantial
deterioration in Korea's external balance. Although exports increased
by 35 percent during the first half of 1995 from a year earlier, buoyed in
part by a real depreciation of the won, imports increased by 38 percent.
As a result, the current account deficit widened in the first half of
1995 to 3 percent of GDP.

Korea began implementing the third phase of its interest rate
deregulation plan in late July. Interest rates on short-term time
deposits have been deregulated, and financial institutions are now
allowed greater latitude in determining the maturity and duration of
money market instruments.

In Russia, the rate of decline in economic activity continued to
abate, and monthly consumer price inflation fell in July. Monetary
aggregates, however, have grown rapidly in recent months, generating
fears of a resurgence in inflation. The monetary base expanded at an
average rate of 13 percent a month during the second quarter, reflecting
the Central Bank's dollar purchases to stem upward pressures on the
ruble. Official net international reserves were $7.3 billion in June.

In early July, an exchange rate band was introduced to slow the
ruble's rapid appreciation. On August 15, the ruble-dollar exchange
rate closed at 4405, near the "upper" (most appreciated) limit. Since
late April 1995, the ruble has appreciated against the dollar about 40
percent in real terms, but is still considered to be substantially
undervalued. The Russian authorities have indicated that the exchange
rate band will remain in place until October 1.
Russia has successfully completed three monthly reviews under its
IMF stand-by arrangement, as all of the program's quantitative
indicative targets were satisfied, although money growth has been faster
than anticipated under the program. Notably, the fiscal deficit for the
first half was 3.5 percent of GDP, well below the program ceiling.
