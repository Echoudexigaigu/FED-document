DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Although some sharply conflicting signals have been present in
the recent economic indicators--especially those for manufacturing--
the data, on balance, point to a moderate step-up in the pace of
activity since the spring. Consistent with this view, the civilian
unemployment rate has remained near the average level of the second
quarter, and just a little above the low for the current expansion.
Signs of incipient acceleration in consumer prices that were
apparent earlier this year have been followed by more favorable
reports in recent months, leaving the inflation rate little changed
on a year-to-year basis.
Employment and Unemployment
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 176,000 in August,
bringing the cumulative increase in such jobs over the past three
months to about 440,000.1 Aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers remained above the second-quarter average
despite a partial reversal of earlier large advances. Since mid-
August, initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained in a
range that suggests another moderate employment gain in September.
Manufacturing payrolls increased 12,000 in August after having
declined about 185,000 over the previous four months, and factory
hours rose for the first time since February. Increases in
employment among most producers of durable goods more than accounted
for the August hiring. The largest additions to payrolls occurred
at producers of industrial machinery and electrical equipment. The
1. An overall increase in payroll jobs of 249,000 in August may
have been held down as much as 65,000 by seasonal adjustment
problems associated with the timing of the survey week within the
month. Total nonfarm payrolls, however, were boosted by a rise of
73,000 in the government sector, more than half of which was in
state and local education. BLS said that this rise in education
jobs was inflated by the failure of seasonal adjustment factors to
fully incorporate movements toward year-round jobs and earlier
school openings.

average workweek of durable goods manufacturers also lengthened in
August, more than reversing a decline in July. By contrast, the
average workweek at factories producing nondurables held steady, and
employment at these plants continued to decline, albeit less rapidly
than in previous months. Apparel was, once again, a notable area of
weakness.
In the service-producing sector, private employment rose
163,000 in August, fairly close to the average for the two previous
months and well above the subpar gains reported during the three
months ended in May. Employment in business services, which had
slowed in the spring, jumped 81,000 last month, bolstered by brisk
hiring at firms that supply personnel to other businesses. In
contrast, retail and wholesale trade lost a combined 13.000 jobs in
August. Eating and drinking establishments showed a sharp decline
in employment in August after two months of strong gains, and the
number of jobs at apparel retailers continued to fall.
As measured by the household survey, both employment and
unemployment moved down in August, and the labor force participation
rate remained near its second-quarter average. The August
unemployment rate edged down a tenth of a percentage point, to
5.6 percent, near the middle of the relatively narrow range of
monthly readings reported so far this year. Other indicators from
the household survey, such as the duration of unemployment, the
number of persons working part-time for economic reasons, and the
data on reasons for unemployment, also have changed little in recent
months.
Alternative indicators of labor demand are consistent with
moderate employment growth. The Conference Board's help-wanted
index rose in July, its first increase since February. In the
latest survey of net hiring plans from Manpower, Inc., the

percentage of employers planning to increase their hiring held
steady in the fourth quarter after declining in the third quarter.
Hiring plans improved in the private service-producing sector and
deteriorated in the government and mining sectors; manufacturers
reported no change. Finally, the latest quarterly Bureau of
National Affairs survey, taken in July and August, indicated an
increase in the number of firms reporting that jobs are difficult to
fill.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 1.1 percent in August after an
upward-revised gain of 0.3 percent in July. Both physical product
data and hours data used in estimating IP showed noticeable step-ups
last month. Hot weather boosted utilities output for the second
straight month, and manufacturing production rose sharply, posting
its first gain since January. As a result, the factory operating
rate climbed to 83.0 percent; that rate is about 2-1/4 percentage
points below the highs reached at the turn of the year but is about
1-3/4 percentage points above the long-run average rate. In
contrast to the IP report, other indicators of demand in the
industrial sector--such as new orders--have not displayed
corresponding vigor, and the underlying trend of IP growth almost
certainly is much more moderate than the growth rate in August.
Utilities output contributed 0.4 percentage point to IP growth
in August. The reading for cooling degree days last month was the
highest August level since 1947. Over the past two months
electricity generation has risen more than 10 percent; but with a
return to normal weather, electricity generation will be a
significant drag on total IP growth in the coming months. Indeed,
weekly data available through September 9 show a large drop.

Output of motor vehicles and parts jumped 4.2 percent in August
after falling 1.5 percent in July. Outside the motor vehicle
sector, manufacturing production rose 0.7 percent last month after
having been flat for several months. Led by a run-up in the
production of furniture and appliances, the output of manufactured
consumer goods other than motor vehicles, a locus of previous
weakness, advanced 0.6 percent, moving about half-way back to its
December peak. The production of construction supplies rose nearly
1 percent, a reflection of recent improvement in building activity.
Materials output moved up for a second month, with notable gains in
primary and fabricated metals.
Growth in business equipment output has remained an important
area of strength in recent months. Robust growth in high-technology
goods--a category that includes computers, semiconductors,
communications equipment, and photographic equipment and makes up
about 12 percent of IP--accounted for two-tenths of a percentage
point of IP growth in August, about the average since January. The
production of industrial equipment also posted a notable increase
last month.
Other indicators of manufacturing activity remain lackluster
and suggest that further large production gains are not in the
offing. Real adjusted new orders for durable goods dropped
2.0 percent in July, after two months of strong readings. The
purchasing managers' indexes of new orders and production--two
series that we find useful in forecasting near-term manufacturing
output--turned down in August. Our most recent conversations with
industry sources provided mixed reports: Orders for steel sheet,
silicon, and other motor vehicle-related products are said to be
flat to down, while sales of high-technology goods remained strong.

Spot prices for industrial materials have softened a bit in
September.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of automobiles and light trucks jumped to an annual rate
of 16.0 million units in August, well above the 14.2 million unit
rate in July. Part of the August rise in sales consisted of a surge
(3/4 million units at an annual rate) in General Motors' shipments
to fleet customers. (Information on retail and fleet sales is based
on confidential data from industry sources.) Although industry
sources expect General Motors to continue to rely on fleet customers
to purchase stocks now held in inventory, the high August pace of
these shipments looks unsustainable. Sales in August may also have
received a boost from buyers who were rushing to beat the early-
September expiration of heavy incentives offered by Japanese
transplant firms. In addition, a source at Toyota says that their
August sales figures included some purchases that occurred over the
September Labor Day weekend. We estimate that the misreporting
artificially boosted August sales 1/4 million units.
Measured against automakers' perceptions of the underlying rate
of sales, which currently center on 14-3/4 million units, stocks of
light vehicles at the end of August were still above desired levels.

Producers therefore are adhering to cautious production strategies
over the near term. Weekly data in hand for September suggest
assemblies could be about 1/2 million units lower than both
September schedules and actual production in August. Production
disruptions at Ford because of parts shortages explain only part of
the shortfall. Although we believe that fourth-quarter schedules of
11.5 million units are slightly understated, upward-adjusted
schedules for the fourth quarter would still look modest.
Consumption and Personal Income
After strong gains in May and June, growth of consumption
expenditures seems to have moderated after mid-year. Based on the
preliminary, and still highly tentative, readings on retail sales
for July and August, real outlays for goods other than motor
vehicles are estimated to have been essentially flat in the last two
months. Spending for durable goods other than motor vehicles moved
up on net in July and August, but outlays for apparel continued to
be quite weak. In terms of quarterly averages, however, the third-
quarter rise in real consumption expenditures still could end up
looking reasonably strong: We estimate that, because of the lift
from the gains of May and June, the average level of real
expenditures for goods other than motor vehicles in July and August
was up about 2-3/4 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter
average.
Elsewhere, some pickup in consumer expenditures on motor
vehicles probably occurred in August, although the surge in auto
sales last month apparently reflected in large part increased
purchases by businesses.2 In addition, outlays for services were
2. Our reading of business purchases of cars and trucks is based
on confidential fleet sales data from GM and Ford, which indicated
that fleet sales accounted for about 80 percent of the August sales
gain at those two automakers. In contrast, in constructing the
NIPAs, registration data are used to allocate motor vehicle sales

up 0.4 percent in July, boosted in part by high demand for energy-
related services due to the unseasonably warm weather; high
temperatures likely continued to push up spending on services in
August.
Income has been volatile in recent months around a moderately
rising trend. After plunging in April because of a spike in
payments associated with the retroactive tax increases of OBRA-93.
real disposable income increased sharply in May, June, and July. In
August, however, declines in hours worked and average hourly
earnings point to weakness in wage and salary income. Averaging
through the monthly numbers (and adjusting for the April spike in
tax payments), income was about flat in the second quarter, but
income in July and August appears to have been noticeably above the
second-quarter average.
Recent indicators of consumer sentiment have been mixed. The
Conference Board index of consumer confidence was at an elevated
level in both July and August, and the Michigan SRC index in those
two months was near the upper end of the range that has prevailed
since the end of 1993. But preliminary results from the Michigan
survey for September showed a sharp decline that brought the index
of sentiment to the lower end of its post-1993 range. Furthermore,
SRC respondents' expectations of the change in unemployment over the
next twelve months--one of the series that we have found to be
(Footnote continued from previous page)
between consumer and business expenditures. Because these data are
available with a lag, BEA generally uses recent average registration
rates when constructing the first estimate of monthly PCE.
Accordingly, we would not be surprised if the initial estimate of
PCE in August--scheduled for publication on October 2--includes a
large jump in outlays for motor vehicles. Actual registration data
for August will be available later next month, so any earlier
misallocation of motor vehicle sales between PCE and PDE ought to be
corrected by the time of the advance estimate of third-quarter GDP
on October 27.

statistically significant in explaining consumption growth--jumped
substantially. On net, unemployment expectations rose considerably
over the summer, reaching their highest level since the fall of
1993. Why expectations of unemployment have taken this adverse turn
in the SRC survey is not clear. Results of the Conference Board
survey show perceptions of labor market conditions holding steady
through August.
The aggregate net worth of households has risen substantially
this year. The broad-based Wilshire 5000 stock-market index was up
17-1/2 percent during the first half of 1995 and has gained another
8-3/4 percent since the end of June. According to the flow of funds
accounts, the value of corporate equities held by households either
directly or through mutual funds was boosted $732 billion by capital
gains during the first two quarters of 1995. All told, assets of
the household sector, both financial and nonfinancial, increased
about $1.6 trillion during the first half. Over the same period,
household liabilities rose about $141 billion. Increased consumer
credit accounted for roughly 30 percent of the increase in
liabilities, and higher mortgage debt, including home equity lines
of credit, accounted for nearly 60 percent. Netting the increases
in assets and liabilities, the net worth of the household sector at
the end of the second quarter was 4.9 times disposable income, up
considerably from the level at the end of 1994 and at the high end
of the range so far in this expansion.
Housing Markets
Single-family housing activity has been strong in recent
months. Multifamily activity, however, has been flat.
Starts of single-family units moved up 6 percent in July and
edged up further to an annual rate of 1.1 million units in August,
the highest reading since last December. Permit issuance for

single-family houses has risen somewhat more rapidly than starts,
corroborating the strength in the production estimates. Sales of
both new homes and existing homes increased in July to the highest
levels in more than a year. Stocks have tightened: The inventory
of new homes for sale was about a six-month supply at the end of
July, a stock slightly leaner than average.
The chief impetus for the recent strengthening in housing
obviously has been the downswing in mortgage interest rates that
extended through mid-July. These declines pushed the proportion of
average household disposable income required to carry a new fixed-
rate mortgage back toward its recent low in late 1993. Mortgage
rates did turn up temporarily in late July and August, but that
upswing has been mostly reversed by a decline in rates over the
first two weeks of September.
Against this financial backdrop, the attitudes of homebuyers
and builders have remained favorable. A sampling of consumers in
early September by the Survey Research Center showed that homebuying
attitudes held in a highly favorable range, and assessments by
homebuilders of the strength of new home sales continued to improve.
Moreover, the MBA index of loan applications for home purchase in
early September was at one of the highest levels on record for the
series, which began in early 1990.
Multifamily housing starts inched down in August, from an
upward-revised July estimate. Moreover, issuance of multifamily
permits dropped nearly 10 percent to the lowest level since last
January. The absence of any sustained rise in multifamily
construction this year likely reflects a continued excess supply of
multifamily housing units relative to demand. Indicators of this
imbalance include the continued high rental vacancy rate for
multifamily housing, a persistent slow decline in real residential

of 1995, a drop in the share that was rented within three months.
Business Fixed Investment
Recent monthly indicators of investment spending have been
mixed, but the fundamental determinants still look reasonably
strong.
The July data on orders and shipments of capital goods were
quite weak. Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft decreased 4.4 percent; both office and computing equipment
and other equipment posted declines that more than offset June
advances. Orders for capital goods other than aircraft and
computers dropped 7.1 percent in July. With the level of orders
slightly below that of shipments, the orders backlog for this
category fell 0.3 percent, the first drop in some time. New
bookings for office and computing equipment fell 11.1 percent in
July.
Although the fundamental determinants of investment have been
pointing to a slowdown in the growth in equipment spending from the
robust rates recorded over the past few years, their recent levels
are still consistent with further growth. While both the
"accelerator" and the growth of cash flow have receded from the high
levels that they reached earlier in the expansion, both indicators
still are at levels that typically have been associated with a solid
expansion of investment. Meanwhile, declines in long-term interest
rates and the rise of the stock market since the start of the year
have led to a favorable turn in the user cost of capital. The user
cost of capital for equipment other than computers has turned down,
and the user cost of capital for computers has fallen at a faster
pace of late.

The ongoing decline in the cost of capital for computers is but
one reason to suspect that the July drop in computer orders was just
another example of the month-to-month volatility that frequently has
shown up in that series, rather than a signal of emerging weakness
in computer investment. Although IBM and Apple Computers have
reported that parts shortages recently have held up shipments,
anecdotal reports from most industry sources suggest that demand is
holding up well. In addition, the Semiconductor Industry
Association's book-to-bill ratio was at a very high level by
historical standards in July and August. While this ratio does not
always match up well with short-term data on orders and shipments,
it has been a fairly reliable indicator of underlying trends in the
computer business.
In the transportation sector, sales of motor vehicles boosted
capital spending significantly in 1994 but have dropped off
appreciably so far this year despite the August bulge in fleet
sales. The bulk of this year's decline can be explained by a drop
in auto leasing that has accompanied the general softening in the
consumer market for automobiles. Sales of heavy-weight trucks
ticked up in August but remained below their second-quarter average.
New orders for trucks have fallen sharply recently. Backlogs of
orders for trucks have turned down, but their level is high and
should keep deliveries from plunging. Shipments of completed
aircraft have been bumpy over the past two months, although a pickup
in bookings for deliveries some years into the future appears to be
emerging.
Turning to nonresidential structures, construction put-in-place
advanced 3.3 percent in July. Outlays for office, institutional,
and industrial structures posted healthy increases, while
construction of other commercial buildings was flat. Smoothing

through the monthly volatility of these series, construction
activity continues to trend up at about the same rate registered in
1994.
Other indicators of commercial construction activity continue
to exhibit a positive tilt. The National Real Estate Index (NREI)
reported price increases over the past year for retail structures,
warehouses, and office buildings. The price increase for office
buildings is especially notable given the sharp declines in office
property values witnessed in recent years. The FDIC's August survey
of real estate conditions was also fairly upbeat; most respondents
reported that conditions are holding steady or improving. Finally,
according to the most recent Coldwell Banker survey, both downtown
and suburban office vacancy rates continued to edge down in the
second quarter.
Business Inventories
Business inventory investment has slowed from the very rapid
pace of early 1995. Although stockpiling continued at a brisk pace
in manufacturing and wholesale trade in July, retail stocks were
drawn down.
In both manufacturing and wholesale trade, a sizable portion of
the July inventory accumulation was in the capital goods sectors, as
can be seen in the table below.3 July additions to stocks were
sizable among manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and
electronic components, as were the increases in inventories among
wholesalers of industrial, professional, and business equipment.
Because these run-ups were accompanied by declines in shipments and
sales, inventory-to-sales ratios in the capital goods sectors moved
3. For manufacturing, capital goods consist of nondefense
machinery and equipment, and automotive products; for wholesale
trade, capital goods include industrial machinery, professional and
business equipment, and one half of motor vehicles.

industries where a sizable portion of the finished products are for

inventories in July were little changed. In wholesale trade,
inventories of non-capital goods showed a hefty rise in book-value
terms in July, but virtually all the increase was in farm products
and groceries and may reflect the surge in the prices of foodstuffs
and feedstuffs around midyear rather than real inventory
accumulation.
In manufacturing, the slump in shipments of durable goods in
July--and the accompanying rise in inventory-sales ratios--may have
been exaggerated by problems of seasonal adjustment. As shown in
the table below, shipments in durable manufacturing have fallen
sharply in July in each of the past two years only to rebound in
August. This pattern in the shipments data has carried through to
inventory-sales ratios, which have tended to tick up in July only to

turn back down in August. Transportation equipment, in particular,
has exhibited spectacular swings in sales in July and August in
recent years, but a similar pattern has appeared, to some degree, in
a number of other durable goods categories. The possibility that
sales in July were not as weak as the data indicate would help to
explain why firms did not hesitate to expand production and
employment in August.

In contrast to the large runups in manufacturing and wholesale
stocks, retail stocks declined in July. Total retail inventories
fell at an annual rate of $25 billion in July, and revised data for
June show a drop as well. Inventories at automotive dealers dropped
about $16 billion at an annual rate in July, and stocks excluding
automotive dealers fell at a rate of $9 billion. At apparel
outlets, stocks declined in July for a second month, and the
inventory-sales ratio of apparel retailers dropped to 2.56 months,
well below the April peak. Stocks also were trimmed in most other
categories of retail outlets. Inventories at general merchandisers
continued to rise, but at a slower pace than in previous months.

Federal Sector
Incoming Treasury data continue to point to a narrowing of the
federal budget deficit in the fiscal year now drawing to a close.
After adjusting for special factors, the unified budget deficit in
the first ten months of fiscal 1995 was 11 percent lower than in the
comparable period of fiscal 1994. Although adjusted outlays
through July increased 5-1/2 percent, receipts grew 8-1/2 percent.
The actual budget deficit for July was $14 billion, less than half
that in July a year earlier.
With the exception of a revision to defense spending, the
picture for outlays appears little changed from the last Greenbook.
Higher interest rates have pushed net interest outlays up from last
year's level. For the fiscal year through July, outlays for
Medicare and health were up about 9 percent from a year earlier, a
pace of growth a bit slower than in the two previous years. Defense
spending declines have continued to damp outlay growth, but the drop
in defense spending this fiscal year will not be so great as earlier
data suggested. The July monthly treasury statement contained an
unusually large $4 billion upward revision to defense outlays,
mostly to spending levels earlier in the fiscal year. As yet, BEA
has not changed its estimates of defense purchases in the national
income and product accounts to reflect the revised monthly data.
4. The auction of spectrum rights and increased proceeds related
to federal deposit insurance were two special factors improving the
deficit over the first ten months of the fiscal year, relative to
the comparable year-earlier period. On September 15, the FDIC
refunded approximately $1.5 billion of deposit insurance premiums to
member banks, but this refund will offset only part of the proceeds
of previous months. The FDIC now estimates that the Bank Insurance
Fund had attained its target level of 1.25 percent of insured
deposits in June, allowing it to retroactively reduce the insurance
premium rate.
The year-to-date deficit was also held down by the shift of
certain payroll and benefits payments into September, 1994 because
their scheduled payment date of October 1 occurred on a weekend. A
similar timing shift occurred between June and July, but it had no
effect on the year-to-date totals.

1. A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a
weekend or holiday. The monthly and fiscal year to date outlays for defense,
income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for this shift.
Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.

II-37
However, all else equal, we would expect to see a smaller decline in
real defense spending in the first quarter of calendar 1995 and a
larger decline in the second quarter when BEA releases its
comprehensive revision later this year.
In its recently released budget update, CBO's current-policy
projection shows an improved outlook for deficits in the near term,
but the longer-term outlook is little changed. The CBO projects
that deficits will rise from $161 billion in fiscal 1995 to
$460 billion in fiscal 2005. A $13 billion downward revision for
fiscal 1995 was largely a result of higher-than-expected receipts
and of lower-than-expected outlays for the Earned Income Tax Credit
and other mandatory programs. For the longer term, downward
revisions to outlays and upward technical revisions to receipts more
than offset decreased revenues resulting from a lower projected
level of nominal GDP.
A substantial amount of work remains on the budget for fiscal
year 1996. The House has passed twelve of the thirteen regular
appropriations bills, but six are still under consideration in the
Senate. None is ready to be sent to the President. As a result,
the President and Congressional leaders have begun discussing the
scope of a continuing resolution to provide interim funding for
discretionary programs; issues to be resolved include the length of
time the resolution will cover, the level of funding it will
provide, and the possibility that the Congress will attach
legislative riders. Meanwhile, committees with jurisdiction over
mandatory spending programs are meeting this week to draft
legislation that will implement the budget resolution adopted in
June. However, some are reportedly having difficulty coming up with
the required spending reductions, and the September 22 deadline
specified in the budget resolution is likely to slip.

State and Local Government Sector
State and local government purchases appear to have picked up
in the third quarter. Led by a sharp rise in highway construction,
real spending on structures rose more than 1-1/2 percent in July,
bringing construction to a level nearly 3 percent above the second-
quarter average. Relatively dry weather in the West and Northeast
probably led to faster completion of some projects.
State and local government employment surged in August after
remaining essentially unchanged in July. On balance, the average
for the two-month period stands 54,000 above the second-quarter
level, about twice the increase seen in the first two quarters of
the year. About half of the August employment gain came from a rise
in education workers. Historically, monthly changes in the
employment of state and local education workers have been fairly
erratic, and a jump like that of August probably says little about
underlying trends in the sector. Indeed, the August increase in
employment of state and local education workers left the year-to-
year change at about 2 percent, well within the range of annual
growth rates reported for this category over the past few years.
Prices
After a step-up early in the year, price increases recently
have eased. The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in August,
and the core CPI increased 0.2 percent. Over the past four months,
the core index has risen at a compound annual rate of 2.4 percent,
well below the 4.2 percent rate of increase during the first four
months of the year. The moderation largely reflects a downturn in
the indexes for used cars and automobile finance charges and a
slowing in the rise of airline fares. The core CPI in August was up
2.9 percent from the level of a year earlier; its increase over the
previous twelve-month period also was 2.9 percent. Price pressures

at earlier stages of processing also have abated, as producer price
increases for intermediate goods and crude materials have dropped
back from the rapid pace earlier in the year.
Consumer energy prices dropped 0.8 percent in July and August,
retracing all of the run-up during the previous three months. The
decline in July and August reflects decreases in crude oil prices in
May and June. Although oil prices since have turned up, the
Lundberg survey points to a further decline in pump prices in
September. Natural gas prices resumed their downward trend in
August after an uptick in July; they have fallen 5.7 percent over
the past twelve months.
The August increase in food prices of 0.2 percent marked the
fourth consecutive month of small increases. Most food categories
continue to show little inflation. The major exceptions of late are
egg prices, which were pushed up sharply in July and August as
unusually hot weather in the East hurt production, and the prices of
some cereal and bakery products, one of the few categories to be
visibly affected by rising grain prices. The index for prices of
food away from home, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the
food index, increased 2.4 percent over the past twelve months, a bit
faster than the year-earlier increase. The total food index also
increased 2.4 percent over the past twelve months, down slightly
from the year-earlier period.
The index for goods other than food and energy rose 0.4 percent
in August--well above its 0.1 percent per month rate of increase
during the previous twelve months. Above-trend increases were
widespread among nondurables. Household paper products increased a
further 1.0 percent, a reflection of increases at earlier stages of
production. Larger-than-usual increases were also posted for
apparel, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages. Prices of durable goods

increased 0.2 percent in August, about the same pace as during the
previous twelve months. Before seasonal adjustment, the price of
new motor vehicles fell 0.2 percent, less than usual for August;
thus, the index rose 0.1 percent on an adjusted basis. Used car
prices fell another 0.7 percent in August, the fourth consecutive
month of substantial declines. Despite the drop, used car prices
are still 9 percent above a year earlier.
Prices of nonenergy services increased only 0.1 percent in
August. Prices for lodging while out of town, a volatile category,
fell 0.9 percent, but service price increases were also held down by
below-trend increases in both owners' equivalent rent and renters'
rent. Among services excluding energy and shelter, auto finance
charges fell another 0.4 percent; the cumulative 6.9 percent decline
in this index since April offsets only part of the nearly 32 percent
increase over the previous twelve months. Airline fares fell
3.5 percent last month after a 20.4 percent increase (not
annualized) during the first half of this year.
In the PPI, price increases among intermediate goods excluding
food and energy have slowed to 0.2 percent per month, on average, in
the past four months, after having risen 8 percent over the previous
twelve months. Although price pressures in markets for softwood
lumber and plywood seem to have picked up and are persisting in
markets for paper and paper products, most intermediate-goods prices
increased more slowly in the latest two months than for the past
year as a whole. Among finished goods, the price of capital goods
inched up only 0.1 percent in August; it was held down by a decline
in the price of heavy trucks. Prices increased for railroad
equipment, tools and dies, and metal-cutting machine tools. Over
the past year, the PPI for finished consumer goods excluding food

and energy has risen 2.1 percent--up from a 1.7 percent increase
over the previous twelve months.
Price indexes for industrial commodities have declined somewhat
since the August Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce commodity price
index has slid 0.9 percent in the past five weeks. Lower prices for
a variety of metals have accounted for most of the drop; prices of
other industrial commodities are mostly unchanged or higher over the
past few weeks. Over 1995, the trend in the Journal of Commerce
index has been essentially flat; last year, by contrast, the index
rose more than 20 percent. An alternative index of industrial
commodity prices, produced by the Commodity Research Bureau, rose
nearly 30 percent in 1994 but has dropped about 3 percent in 1995.
Prices of agricultural commodities have increased, on balance,
since mid-August. Hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in late
summer, and the Department of Agriculture's September update of its
crop production forecasts showed moderate downward revisions to
yields of corn, wheat, and most other crops except soybeans.
Because stocks of some crops--notably corn and wheat--are likely to
be drawn down to quite low levels over the year ahead, prices in
coming months may be unusually sensitive to any shocks that might
arise. In that regard, crop markets this week are responding to
forecasts of an early-autumn freeze in the Midwest. In livestock
markets, price changes have been mixed since mid-August. Cattle
prices have moved up from midsummer lows; hog prices and broiler
prices have held steady recently after advancing earlier in the
summer.

to month, and strings of increases often are interrupted from time
to time by a decline. Over the past twelve months, average hourly
earnings have increased 3.0 percent--up from a 2.5 percent increase
over the previous twelve months and a 2.2 percent rise over the
twelve months ended August 1993. By comparison, the employment cost
index for production and nonsupervisory workers in private industry
rose 3.0 percent over the twelve months ended in June, up
0.1 percentage point from the increase over the previous twelve
months. The ECI for all workers in the private nonfarm sector,
however, slowed 0.2 percentage point over the same period.
Revised data on labor productivity and costs in the nonfarm
business sector--prompted chiefly by revisions to output growth in
the NIPA--indicate that productivity rose 4.8 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter, 1.8 percentage points more than
previously estimated.5 As noted in the last Greenbook, the
growth rate in hours in the second quarter was depressed by an
inexplicably low workweek in May and a steep decline in the number
of self-employed workers in the second quarter, the latter a
historically volatile series. Both measures have since rebounded.
We therefore continue to believe that productivity growth in the
second quarter may have been overstated. Over the year ended in the
second quarter, productivity increased 3.6 percent; since the
last expansion ended, it has increased at an average annual rate
of 2.0 percent.
5. Growth of nonfarm business output, which is derived from data
on payments to the factors of production, was revised up
considerably more than was GDP growth in the preliminary NIPA report
for the second quarter of 1995. Corporate profits, which are not
published in the advance GDP release, provided a stronger boost to
factor payments than the BEA had implicitly estimated when it
prepared the advance estimate of nonfarm output.
6. Beginning in December, the BLS will report productivity and
costs data on a chain-weighted basis rather than on a 1987 dollar
basis. As the data now stand, the chain-weighted figures show a
substantially lower rate of productivity growth since the end of the
last expansion--1.2 percent at an annual rate.

The revised second-quarter data on hourly compensation in the
nonfarm business sector were little changed from the previous
estimate. Hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent
in the second quarter, down 0.6 percentage point from the first-
quarter increase but about average for the past year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Yields on Treasury securities declined over the intermeeting
period, by 20 to 30 basis points at the short end and about 40 basis
points at the long end. The decline in interest rates occurred amid
reports suggesting that economic activity had firmed from the weak
second-quarter pace but that the step-up was moderate and presented
few inflationary risks. Against that backdrop, and with a firming
dollar, market participants now see the odds as favoring another
easing by the System in the coming months. Futures rates on federal
funds and Eurodollars have a noticeable downward tilt into early
1996 (chart).
Other long-term interest rates followed rates on Treasuries
downward. With corporate earnings continuing, on average, to meet
or exceed expectations, the stock market rallied along with the bond
market. Major indexes have gained about 3 percent to 4-1/2 percent
since the August FOMC meeting and stand close to record highs.
The growth of debt of nonfederal sectors seems to have slowed
in recent months. Bank loans to businesses have grown less rapidly,
at a time when bond issuance has been subdued (although there are
indications of a pickup in bond volume this month). Household
borrowing may have slowed a bit, too; consumer credit decelerated in
July, and data from commercial banks (adjusted for securitization)
suggest a further slowing in August. State and local government
debt continued to contract because of retirements of prerefunded
bonds.
The federal government has been able to cover a good portion of
its third-quarter deficit by drawing down the Treasury's cash
balance. Treasury debt subject to statutory limit was $18 billion
shy of the current debt ceiling at the end of August, and this
leeway should be exhausted before long. Financial markets have

begun to pay more attention to the issue of a default by the
Treasury, but yields on bills maturing around mid-November remain in
line with yields on those maturing sooner, suggesting that investors
are not currently giving much weight to that possibility.
The broad monetary aggregates continued to expand robustly in
August, pushing M2 closer to the upper bound of its 1 percent to
5 percent annual range and M3 further above the top of its 2 percent
to 6 percent range. M1, in contrast, continued to shrink as more
banks offered sweep accounts to their retail customers, pulling down
reservable deposits. Bank credit picked up last month despite a
slowing in most loan components.
Money and Bank Credit
M1 contracted near a 1-1/2 percent annual rate in August, with
other checkable deposits continuing to run off (table). OCDs are
about $35 billion below their level at the end of 1993, in large
part because of the spread of programs to sweep these funds into
MMDAs. Since introduced its sweep program early last
year, at least eight additional bank holding companies have followed
suit, with four starting up last month. These arrangements to avoid
reserve requirements have been an important factor in a drop in
total reserves of more than $4 billion since December 1993.
M2, which is unaffected by OCD sweeps, picked up to an
8-1/4 percent annual rate in August. Expansion was sustained by
another strong showing by retail money market mutual funds, whose
returns continued to lag the decline in market rates. The major
factors accounting for the pickup in M2 growth, however, were
turnarounds in overnight RPs--perhaps associated with increased
holdings of government securities by banks--and in Eurodollar
deposits. Households continued to favor M2 assets over direct
acquisition of debt securities, as suggested by the lack of

noncompetitive tenders at Treasury auctions, and over indirect
purchases in the form of shares of bond mutual funds, which have
posted only meager growth of late (chart). In contrast, stock funds
experienced strong inflows again last month.
M3 growth slowed in August but remained substantial. This year
M3 growth has been supported in part by an increased reliance on
deposits in relation to nondeposit sources (chart). Nonetheless,
deposits in M3 remain a relatively less important source for funding
credit growth than at any time before 1992.
Growth in bank credit picked up a bit in August, to a
5-1/4 percent annual rate (table). Securities holdings recovered
after three months of run-off, more than offsetting a noticeable
slowing in loan growth. Unlike many months of this year, growth in
August was not affected very much by changes in the market value of
securities or in the value of off-balance-sheet items.
Weakening was evident in most major loan components in August.
A drop in business loan growth was consistent with last month's
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which showed a sizable decline
in the net number of banks reporting increased business loan demand.
Paydowns of bank debt using the proceeds of bond issuance and
commercial paper programs likely also played a role. Consistent
with weaker demand in the face of largely unchanged supply
conditions, data from the latest Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to
Business show that the spread of average loan rates over the federal
funds rate edged down in the third quarter. The volatility of these
data, however, counsel against reading too much into small, single-
quarter movements. On balance, spreads have remained around the
narrow levels seen over the past several quarters.
Real estate loans cooled off from their July pace, although
some of the slowdown can be accounted for by a drop in acquisitions

securitizations of consumer receivables dipped. Adjusted for
securitizations, however, consumer loans decelerated from
14-1/2 percent in July to 13 percent in August. Security loans fell
sharply in August, perhaps reflecting a drop in the financing needs
of securities dealers in light of the subdued pace of issuance in
capital markets.
Indicators of bank loan quality were mixed in the second
quarter (chart). The Call Report shows that delinquency rates for
business and real estate loans edged down from already low levels
but that delinquency rates on consumer loans rose; net charge-off
rates followed the same pattern. With clear evidence that the
quality of consumer loan portfolios has begun to deteriorate, the
question is whether an erosion will also occur in other loan types.
The banking industry seems well-supplied with capital to handle such
an event, however. On balance, the quality of assets has remained
high. allowing banks to hold down provisions for loan losses,
thereby helping to maintain healthy profits. Net interest margins
remained wide in the second quarter, although somewhat below their
exceptional levels in 1993 and 1994.
Business Finance
The staff estimates that overall borrowing by nonfinancial
corporations was lighter in August (chart), after firms raised
substantial funds in bond markets in the second quarter. Borrowing
appears to be picking up a bit in September, however.
Gross public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations were
sluggish in August (table), as they had been in July after the
backup in long-term interest rates. However, the decline in bond
rates since late August has prompted a pickup in gross issuance of

investment-grade bonds in recent weeks. Although there have been no
public offerings of high-yield debt so far this month, dealers
expect a spate of issues to come to market shortly. This
expectation and the recent defaults of a few speculative-grade
companies have caused spreads on junk bonds to widen since the
August FOMC. Nonetheless, the spreads remain narrow by historical
standards, and this year's default rate, while up from the levels
recorded over the past few years, is still low.
Commercial paper outstanding at U.S. nonfinancial corporations
rose in August. More than half of the growth was attributable to
the establishment of new programs by two companies, and in one case
some of the proceeds were used to pay down a large bank loan. Both
new programs reflected the tendency this year to use commercial
paper primarily to meet core short-term borrowing needs, in contrast
to its heavy use last year for financing mergers and acquisitions.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was little
changed in August from the moderate July pace. Spurred by the rally
in technology stocks this year, computer-related companies accounted
for about a third of funds raised in equity markets in August.
Announcements for the third quarter indicate that nonfinancial
corporations plan to continue repurchasing their own shares at a
rapid rate (chart). Recently, both Chrysler and IBM announced a
doubling of the size of their ongoing programs--to $2 billion and
$5 billion, respectively. These two large programs have been
undertaken to satisfy shareholder demands that managements pay out
part of their sizable cash holdings. Merger and acquisition
activity, which has been strong this year, also seems poised to
continue at a rapid pace. Seven large mergers have been announced
since mid-August, all to be financed with stock swaps, thereby
resulting in no significant borrowing. Substantial debt financing

III-13
will be needed, however, to complete the Disney/Capital Cities-ABC
and Westinghouse/CBS mergers, with the former relying on a
combination of commercial paper and bond issues, and the latter
mainly on bank debt. With share retirements from previously
announced repurchases and merger activity, net equity issuance has
continued negative in the current quarter and should remain so for
several quarters.
Corporate earnings for the second quarter exceeded the
expectations of market analysts, on balance. The improved earnings
picture placed the S&P 500 price-earnings ratio at the end of August
at 16.2, down slightly from 16.9 at the beginning of the year.
Fueled by merger activity and by expectations of lower interest
rates, share prices of financial companies outpaced the broader
market averages over the intermeeting period.
State and Local Government Borrowing
Boosted by a few large refunding issues, gross offerings of
municipal securities increased in August (table), but preliminary
data for the first half of September suggest a return to the slower
pace that has characterized most of this year. Through August,
gross issuance for 1995 was 22 percent below the rate for the same
period in 1994. reflecting the falloff in refunding volume.
Bond retirements continued to overwhelm gross issuance, causing
further shrinkage in the stock of outstanding municipal debt. From
year-end 1994 through August, the stock of long-term debt fell
$41 billion, or more than 4 percent. To a large extent, the debt
retired was prerefunded in the early 1990s. Because the stock of
such debt yet to be retired may be more than $300 billion,
retirements should be large, and net issuance negative, for some
time to come.

Although rates on tax-exempt debt declined over the
intermeeting period, the ratio of yields on thirty-year tax-exempt
bonds to yields on thirty-year Treasury bonds has remained very high
(chart). One factor boosting yield ratios since April is the
concern about reforms that would reduce or eliminate the tax-exempt
status of municipal debt. When several such proposals were unveiled
in mid-April, the tax-exempt to taxable ratios rose even for debt
with short maturities (chart). Later, the ratio for short-term debt
fell back, as the market recognized that these securities would
likely mature before implementation of any reforms. In contrast,
the ratio for thirty-year debt has not fallen at all, presumably
because there remains a perceived risk to the tax preference for
municipal bond income. The ratio for ten-year debt has declined
somewhat from its peak but remains higher than it was in mid-April,
consistent with the expectation that tax reform may not be enacted
for several years.

A second, but less important, factor boosting yield ratios is a
perception of increased credit risk in municipal securities.
Although rating changes, on net, were favorable during the first
half of 1995, the bankruptcy of Orange County and the budget woes of
Los Angeles and the District of Columbia have caused quality spreads
to widen in the municipal market since the spring.
California state legislators approved a plan (already endorsed
by the Orange County Board of Supervisors and major non-county
participants in the investment pool) that would take Orange County
out of bankruptcy. The plan involves a combination of funding
sources--new debt issues, restructuring of existing debt, asset
sales, diversion of tax revenues, and proceeds from litigation--to
repay claimants, grouped by seniority. Although holders of Orange
County bonds and vendors are nearly assured of payment, claimants
with lower priority may not receive dollar-for-dollar compensation
because financing for some of these claims relies on the successful
outcomes of pending lawsuits.
Federal Government Borrowing
The projected third-quarter deficit of $38 billion has been
financed by drawing down the Treasury's substantial cash balance and
by borrowing from the public (table). Because the August midquarter
refunding included a thirty-year bond, and because auction sizes for
the three-, ten-, and thirty-year issues were raised, recent
borrowing has been tilted toward coupon issues and saw net
redemptions of nearly $9 billion in Treasury bills. At present, the
sizes of the weekly bill auctions stand at $24 billion, down only
marginally from gross sizes at the time of the August FOMC but down
$3 billion since the end of the second quarter.

With Treasury debt subject to statutory limit drawing close to
the $4,900 billion ceiling, remaining borrowing authority should be
exhausted around the end of October, even if bill auction sizes are
trimmed further and the October five-year note auction is canceled.
Without legislation to lift the ceiling, the Treasury faces a
shortfall in cash to meet its obligations no later than November 15,
when $25 billion of coupon payments come due and $33 billion of
securities are scheduled to mature. Financial markets, however, are
giving little weight to the possibility of a Treasury default.
Yields on bills maturing around November 15 are in line with yields
on bills maturing before that date, revealing the money market's
opinion that an extension of the debt ceiling (though perhaps a
temporary one) will not be held hostage in the battle over the
budget.
Overall borrowing by government-sponsored enterprises slowed in
July after a strong second quarter, and anecdotal information
indicates that borrowing was sluggish in August as well. In
domestic markets, government-sponsored enterprises continued to call
existing debt. With the decline in demand for exotic structured
notes, new issues have tended to be noncallable debentures or notes
with simple call structures. In global markets, government-
sponsored enterprises continued to be active. Recent issues by
Freddie Mac, Sallie Mae, and Fannie Mae (all with five-year
maturities) amounted to $1-3/4 billion, with the Sallie Mae issue
denominated in yen. Another issuer in global markets, the Tennessee
Valley Authority, was the subject of a recent GAO report to Congress
expressing concern that unless TVA reduced its $26 billion in debt
outstanding, it might ultimately require direct government support.
Last year, nearly 35 percent of TVA's current revenue was used to

II-19
service debt, compared with about 16 percent at private-sector
utilities.
Consumer Borrowing
Growth in installment credit slowed in July to an 11 percent
annual rate, a bit below the range of the past few quarters (table).
A moderation in the growth of revolving credit accounted for most of
the deceleration. Whether the slowdown in revolving credit signals
a new trend is unclear at this point; its steep rise over the past
two years has been punctuated by other one-month interruptions of
similar size.
The auto component of consumer credit strengthened in July
despite a drop in unit new-car sales that month. However, technical
differences often prevent a close matching of monthly movements in
the series on auto credit and new-car sales: The credit data
reflect activity in used-car as well as new-car markets, and the
booking of loans typically lags the recording of sales transactions
by a few days. Aside from these differences, heavy use of price
rebates on new cars in July may have induced a shift away from
leasing toward buying, with loans as the means of finance.
Some lenders reportedly have become more cautious about
extending credit-card debt because of poorer payment performance
recently. Delinquencies on credit card accounts have increased from
very low rates near the end of last year (chart). Call Report data,
which are based on dollar amounts at all commercial banks, showed a
rise in the second quarter. According to a survey of about
500 banks by the American Bankers Association (ABA), the number of
delinquent accounts, having increased sharply in 1994-Q4 and
1995-Ql, moved up further in the second quarter, to 3.24 percent.
Charge-offs on the Call Report also moved up noticeably.

securitized pools, tracked by Moody's (not shown), exhibit a pattern
of small increases from low levels, similar to that of the Call
Report.
According to some large card issuers, a rising number of
bankruptcies--often of cardholders with previously untarnished
payment records--has pushed credit losses higher in recent months.
Indeed, personal bankruptcies increased moderately over the first
half of 1995 after several quarters of decline. Before then,
bankruptcies had risen almost fourfold from the mid-1980s through
1992. That surge appeared to reflect a change in the relative
attractiveness of bankruptcy as a means to solve debt problems.
Changes in federal and state law that protected a larger amount of
assets from liquidation in bankruptcy proceedings, a general
lessening of the social stigma of bankruptcy, and vigorous
advertising of bankruptcy services by lawyers all played a role.
Evidence of increased payment difficulties has also cropped up
in auto loans. The major auto finance companies have been reporting
rising delinquencies on car loans for several quarters, and
commercial banks surveyed by the ABA reported a sharp rise in auto
loan delinquencies during the second quarter, reversing a long
downtrend. Delinquencies were up moderately on other types of
closed-end loans, according to the ABA series. On the Call Report,
however, delinquency rates outside the credit card area were little
changed.
Mortgage Borrowing
Rates on conventional home mortgage loans declined over the
intermeeting period. Having retraced most of its August run-up, the
average contract rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is down
about 35 basis points, to 7.60 percent, and now stands just above
its June lows. Initial rates on adjustable rate mortgages (ARM)

indexed to the one-year Treasury constant maturity yield declined
about 15 basis points, further narrowing the FRM-ARM rate spread
(chart). A narrowing of the spread usually implies a shift toward
fixed-rate mortgages, and this effect seems to have continued in the
current quarter. Corroborating evidence of the shift to fixed-rate
loans can be found in increased issuance of federally related pass-
through securities (not shown). Increased issuance at Fannie Mae
and Ginnie Mae offset a slowing at Freddie Mac and boosted gross
issuance in July. Net issuance picked up to about a $6 billion
pace. In the collateralized mortgage obligation market, the volume
of agency offerings has remained depressed, as it has been since
late last year because of investor concern about the risks of
holding derivative securities.
Borrowers may have begun to respond to the recent declines in
mortgage interest rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)
home purchase index has ratcheted upward this year as rates have
declined. The MBA refinancing index stood at 167 in the week ended
September 8. This level was well below the peak level of 900
reached during the early 1990s refinancing boom, but it was
substantially above the year-ago level of 57.
Preliminary estimates for total mortgage debt growth in the
second quarter show a slowing in overall activity on a seasonally
adjusted basis (table). In the residential category, growth in
mortgage debt outstanding on single-family homes edged down to an
annual rate of 4-1/2 percent, while growth in debt on multifamily
residences nearly doubled from its first-quarter pace. The slowdown
in nonresidential debt was accounted for by a run-off at thrift
institutions and life insurance companies and a slowing at
commercial banks. Farm mortgage debt accelerated somewhat.

II-25
The evidence on real estate loan delinquency rates in the
second quarter was mixed (chart). Call Report data for dollar
amounts of home mortgages at banks showed a very slight drop, but
MBA data, which are for the number of home mortgages at a sample of
all lenders, showed a slight rise. Nonetheless, both measures
remained quite low by recent historical standards.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In July, the deficit in trade in goods and services was about the
same as in June (revised) as both exports and imports declined. For
exports, the largest decreases were in industrial supplies (primarily
gold and chemicals, both from unusually strong levels) and capital goods
(largely aircraft), For imports, the declines were almost entirely in
automotive products (for the third months in a row) and oil (both price
and quantity). The total quantity of oil imported in July fell
reflecting a strong pick-up in production and an easing of consumption.
Preliminary DOE statistics indicate that in August oil imports probably
rebounded as production fell off.

substantially larger than in the first quarter. The value of
exports of goods and services was 2-1/2 percent higher than in the
first quarter. About two-thirds of the rise was in quantity, with
the sharpest increases recorded for capital goods.
The value of imports of goods and services in the second
quarter was 4 percent higher than in the first quarter with
increases spread across most major trade categories, except
automotive products from Canada. For non-oil imports other than
computers, the quantity in the second quarter was about 2 percent

higher than in the first; this was nearly the same rate of increase
as in the first quarter and slower than in any quarter of last year
Prices of Oil
The prices of imported oil fell sharply in July. As in June,
this decline was in line with the drop in spot oil prices over the
previous few months prompted largely by rising production by OPEC
and non-OPEC producers. As a result of an earlier run-up in prices,
however, the average price of imported oil was considerably higher
in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
More recently, spot oil prices (West Texas Intermediate) have
rebounded, reflecting unusually low petroleum and product
inventories in the United States and uncertainty surrounding the
events in Iraq (the defection of two high level Iraqi government
officials and the U.S. military build-up in the Gulf Region).
These factors, as well as concern over the effect of several
hurricanes on key Caribbean refineries, have also supported oil
prices in September to date. Spot WTI averaged $18.03 per barrel in
August, compared with $17.30 per barrel in July. Currently, spot
WTI is trading around $18.96 per barrel.
Prices of Merchandise Non-oil Imports and Exports
In July, prices of U.S. non-oil imports resumed increasing
after a one-month pause. As was the case during most of the past
year, the primary contribution to this increase was the rising price
of industrial supplies. For the second quarter of 1995, prices rose
at rates similar to those recorded in the third and fourth quarters
of 1994. There were increases in all categories with the exception
of food (due in part to a sharp drop in coffee prices in June).
Prices of exports increased slightly in July, largely driven by
price increases for agricultural products. In the second quarter,
export prices rose 7 percent (AR), only slightly less than in the
first quarter. In both the first and second quarters the increase

U.S. Current Account through 1995-Q2
In the second quarter of 1995, the U.S. current account
deficit widened $18.4 billion, SAAR, from the level reported
(revised) for the first quarter. Most of the change between the
first and second quarters was from larger net deficits in trade and
in investment income.

The larger net deficit in investment income was more than
accounted for by income on portfolio investment; it reflected
continued growth in U.S. net portfolio indebtedness and a bunching
of coupon payments on foreign holdings of U.S. securities that is
not yet adequately reflected in the BEA's seasonal adjustment. In
contrast, direct investment receipts increased more rapidly than

IV-7
payments. Robust growth in receipts from U.S. direct investment
abroad continued across all industries. Increases in payments from
foreign direct investment in the United States were most pronounced
in manufacturing.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Recorded capital inflows through both foreign official reserve
accumulations in the United States and foreign private purchases of
U.S. securities accelerated further in July. Recorded capital
outflows through U.S. private purchases of foreign securities rose
slightly in July from their already robust pace in June. Banking
recorded a small net capital inflow in the month as borrowing under
RP arrangements offset a reduction in net interbank borrowing.
Official reserve accumulation by countries outside of the G-10
accounted for nearly all of the official inflow in July (line 1 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Argentina,
Brazil, Singapore, and China increased their reserves in the United
States substantially. Partial data from the FRBNY for August and
the first half of September show a small official inflow since the
end of July. Although Japan accounts for most of this latter
inflow, it is much smaller than Japan's recorded exchange market
intervention over the period.
Foreign private purchases of U.S. securities picked up further
in July from their already heady pace in June (line 4). Most of the
increase in foreign purchases was in Treasuries and this was
concentrated in the United Kingdom (with the ultimate purchasers
therefore unknown). As in the previous two months, recorded
Japanese net purchases of Treasuries were large in July--above $6
billion--bringing the total for the May-July period to almost $19
billion. During 1993 and 1994 Japanese monthly net purchases of
Treasuries averaged about $1 billion and only twice exceeded $4
billion.

U.S. purchases of foreign securities also accelerated in July,
as a large increase in U.S. purchases of foreign equities more than
offset a reduction in U.S. net purchases of foreign bonds (line 5).
The increase in equities purchases was primarily in the developed
countries with purchases in Japan jumping from $1.3 billion in June
to $3.8 billion in July.
Transactions by banks and securities dealers on net recorded a
small inflow in July, in sharp contrast to the large outflows
recorded earlier in the year (line 3). This inflow was more than
accounted for by borrowing by securities dealers in the United
States. In interbank transactions, both U.S.-based and foreign-
based banks in the United States continued to reduce their level of
net borrowing from abroad. Available data for August indicate a net
inflow through interbank transactions, on a month average basis
(line 1 of the International Banking Data table).
Balance of payments data for the second quarter record robust
direct investment capital flows both into and out of the United
States (lines 6 and 7 of the Summary table above). In the first
half of this year, U.S. direct investment abroad was well above last
year's pace. In the first half, direct investment to Europe
exceeded its total for last year, and investment flows to other
regions, including Latin America, were near last year's pace.
Direct investment flows to Mexico, which fell off sharply in the
first quarter, rebounded strongly in the second. Foreign direct
investment into the United States is also running ahead of last
year's pace, as large inflows from Europe more than offset a sizable
decline in inflows from Japan.
The statistical discrepancy in the international accounts
remained positive in the second quarter, indicating net unrecorded
capital inflows. The discrepancy was significantly smaller than in

the first quarter, however, in part reflecting much smaller net currency
shipments to foreigners.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average dollar is about unchanged on balance since
the August 22 FOMC meeting. Over the intermeeting period the dollar
strengthened 6-3/4 percent further against the yen, in part reflecting
monetary easing, massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan, and
smaller Japanese current account figures. Statements by various
Japanese officials may also have convinced some market participants that
Japanese authorities are willing to take additional steps to effect more
yen depreciation. Although the Bundesbank, and many other European
central banks, eased official interest rates over the intermeeting
period, the dollar is 1 percent lower on balance against the mark and
most other European currencies. After depreciating against the Canadian
dollar early in the intermeeting period, the U.S. dollar recently has
strengthened and currently stands 1/4 percent higher on balance since
the August 22 FOMC meeting. Recent jitters ahead of Quebec's sovereignty
referendum on October 30 have put downward pressure on the Canadian
dollar.
After drifting somewhat higher following the August 22 FOMC
meeting, the dollar shot up 1-1/4 percent against the yen on September 6
when the Bank of Japan purchased very large amount of dollars following
the release of data that showed a smaller-than-expected Japanese current
account surplus in July. On September 8, the dollar rose 3/4 percent
further when the Bank of Japan, in a widely anticipated move, reduced its
discount rate by 1/2 percentage point to 1/2 percent and guided the call
money rate about 35 basis points lower to trade a bit below the discount
rate. Moreover, the Bank on that day broke its previous record, set on
August 2, for single-day dollar purchases. Since September 8, the dollar
has risen 3-1/2 percent more as various Japanese officials have
suggested that further yen depreciation is desirable.

Due largely to expectations, and subsequent realization, of
monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, the Japanese 3-month interest rate
has fallen about 35 basis points over the intermeeting period. Long-term
interest rates in Japan have tumbled 55 basis points.
On August 24, the Bundesbank announced reductions of 50 basis
points in its discount and lombard rates to 3.50 percent and 5.50
percent, respectively. This action in Germany was followed immediately
by official rate reductions in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, and the
Netherlands. However, the dollar's rise against the mark following the
Bundesbank's announcement was reversed within hours due in part to
weaker-than-expected data on U.S. durable goods orders in July that may
have led some market participants to revise downward their assessment of
the underlying strength of the U.S. economy. Since August 24, the dollar
has declined 1 percent against the mark.
The Swedish krona, which came under significant downward pressure
earlier this year, has strengthened against the mark and the dollar over
the intermeeting period. The krona has benefited from expectations that
Sweden soon may adopt credible fiscal consolidation plan, and by Swedish
inflation rates that, on a year-on-year basis, recently have declined.
Short-term interest rates in most European countries have fallen
since the August 22 FOMC meeting largely in sympathy with the cumulative
33 basis point reduction in the Bundesbank's repo rate. Long-term
interest rates in most European countries have declined also. The
decline in long-term rates has been most pronounced in Sweden, where
factors mentioned above have helped spur a bond market rally. Short-term
interest rates in Canada rose sharply last week, but have retreated
somewhat in recent days, as the Canadian dollar came under downward
pressure.

IV-14
The Mexican peso has declined 1-3/4 percent against the dollar over
the intermeeting period. Interest rates on most cetes maturities have
continued to drift lower. The remaining outstanding loans from the Bank
of Mexico's FOBOPROA window, which, at the height of the Mexican
financial crisis in March reached nearly $4 billion and have declined
steadily since, were repaid on September 6. Since the August 22 FOMC
meeting, the Mexican stock market has risen 3 percent. Spreads on
Mexican Brady bond have widened about 1/4 percentage point.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data on real activity in major foreign industrial countries on
average confirm that the slowing from the pace of growth in 1994
persisted through the first half of this year. Growth in Japan was
moderate in the second quarter, following a slight decline in the first
quarter. Available information suggests that the slowing of output
growth in the United Kingdom continued into the third quarter. In
Canada, the second-quarter contraction in activity left the level of
output essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of last year. In
contrast. German growth picked up substantially in the second quarter
from a sluggish first quarter, and indicators for the third quarter are
positive on balance. Private consumption spending bouyed activity in
both Germany and France, while investment was surprisingly weak.
Inflation pressures remain subdued, owing in part to declines in
the prices of food and energy. Price deflation at the consumer and
wholesale levels continues in Japan, while a new measure of consumer
prices in western Germany indicated inflation of only 1.5 percent in
August. French inflation is low as well, with a blip in August entirely
attributable to an increase in the VAT. U.K. inflation remains just
under 3 percent, and the recent slowdown in producer price inflation will
reduce the inflationary pressure on retail margins. Canadian inflation
has edged down in recent months to 2-1/4 percent.

IV-15
New fiscal packages were announced in Japan and France. The
supplemental measures in Japan--amounting to Y14.2 trillion or $138
billion--are expected to add Y6-7 trillion in new government spending
beginning in the fourth quarter. In France, budget plans for 1996 are
intended to reduce the government deficit, and make progress toward
meeting the Maastricht criterion.
Individual country notes. GDP advanced at a pace of 3.1 percent
(SAAR) in Japan during the second quarter, after a revised decline of 0.1
percent in the first quarter. Growth was led by private consumption and
investment. Available indicators for the third quarter indicate
weakness in private-sector activity, however. Industrial

production fell again in July as did new machinery orders. After
registering a sizable decline in the second quarter, new car
registrations--an important indicator of durable consumption--
continued to decline in July. The unemployment rate has held steady
since April at or near its post-war high of 3.2 percent, and the job
offers/applicants ratio has levelled out in recent months as well.

Japanese consumer prices fell in August to a level 0.5 percent
below year-earlier levels. Wholesale prices rose 0.7 percent in August,
but were still 1 percent lower than 12 months earlier.
In the Bank of Japan's August survey (Tankan), the index of
business sentiment of major manufacturing firms was down slightly from
the previous survey taken in May. This was the first decrease after five

The current account surplus (seasonally adjusted) was $9.6 billion
in July, down significantly from June. In July, the trade surplus
(seasonally adjusted) was $8.1 billion.
On September 20, authorities announced a supplementary budget
package worth Y14.2 trillion (about $138 billion) equivalent and 3
percent of GDP) , a somewhat larger amount than had been expected. About
half of the package is earmarked for public investment expenditure;
other components include land purchases, increased loans for housing and

IV-17
small businesses, assistance to farmers, and spending on
telecommunications and other technical/scientific programs. The
package also contains some tax measures aimed at revitalizing securities
markets. The portion of the package representing real stimulus to the
economy is estimated to be about Y6-7 trillion (about 1-1/2 percent of
GDP), most of which should take effect in 1996. Financing the new
package will require issuance of about Y8 trillion in new national and
local government bonds.
In Germany, real GDP advanced at a pace of roughly 2-1/2 percent
(SAAR) in the first half of 1995, about the same rate as in the second
half of 1994. Although average growth was about in line with market
expectations, the quarterly pattern of growth and the main source of
strength (consumption, not investment) was surprising, as well as the
sharp downward revision to the fourth quarter of 1994.

Indicators for the third quarter are limited, but industrial
production and orders for July suggest some rebound from the weakness
evidenced in June. (Data on real activity are unreliable, owing to new

IV-18
statistical methods that aim to bring German statistics into line with EU
standards.) The labor market remains stagnant, with little change in
unemployment rates this year. The redefined measure of consumer prices
indicates that inflation in western Germany slowed to 1.5 percent in
August on a 12-month basis. According to the new measure, 12-month
inflation has been at or below 2 percent each month since January.

In France, GDP growth slowed to 1.4 percent (SAAR) in the second
quarter from 2.7 percent in the first quarter. The slowdown in the
second quarter reflected a surprisingly large drop in investment growth
from its moderate pace in the first quarter, sharply lower growth of
exports, and a substantial drawdown of inventories. Second-quarter
growth was sustained by strong consumption, which largely reflects
purchases in advance of the expiration of the government's auto subsidy
program and the 2 percentage point increase in the VAT (to 20.6 percent)
on August 1.

Consumer prices in August were 1.9 percent above their year earlier
level, up from the 1.5 percent increase registered in July. The rise in

On September 20, Prime Minister Jupp6 presented to parliament his
government's budget for 1996. The budget contains tax increases and
expenditure measures intended to reduce the 1996 central government

IV-20
budget deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP from a target of 4.2 percent in 1995.
Juppe also proposed measures to cut the deficit in the social security
budget (which is separate from the central government budget) in half to
1/3 of one percent of GDP in order to reduce the general government budget
deficit to 4 percent from 5 percent in 1995. The objective is to reduce
the general government deficit to 3 percent in order to meet the
Maastricht criterion by 1997. Most of the actual deficit reduction is to
be achieved by expenditure restraint, although spending to support job
creation rises sharply. The budget eliminates or narrows a number of tax
breaks for saving. These tax measures are to be part of a reform of the
income tax system, to be announced by the end of the year, that will
include significant cuts in payroll taxes and a broadening of the income
tax base.
Real GDP growth for the United Kingdom slowed to 1.9 percent (SAAR)
in the second quarter, while the growth of GDP excluding oil and gas
extraction was unchanged at 2.3 percent. Domestic demand rose rapidly in
part due to a strong rebound in investment and a large positive
contribution from inventory accumulation. The contribution from net
exports was quite negative.
Third-quarter data suggest a slight slowdown in the pace of growth.
In July, industrial production was little changed from its second-
quarter average despite a surge in oil and gas extraction; manufacturing
output fell 0.2 percent from its second-quarter average. Furthermore,
in August, the purchasing-managers' survey indicated the smallest
growth of output in three years.
Retail sales fell sharply in August, leaving average sales in July-
August 0.2 percent above their second-quarter average level. The
unemployment rate fell slightly to 8.2 percent in August, after
remaining unchanged in the previous four months. Production plans
(revealed in CBI surveys) have fallen from their first-quarter peak but
were fairly strong in August.

earnings inflation has helped to mitigate the inflationary impact of the

large runup in producer input prices this year. In recent months, input
price inflation has slowed and expectations of price increases in the CBI
survey have fallen back considerably since their peak in January.
In Italy, consumer price inflation on a 12-month basis rose further
in August to 5.8 percent, up from 5.6 percent in July. Inflationary
pressures were more evident at the wholesale level, as prices increased
11.5 percent in July on a 12-month basis. Wage inflation remained
relatively moderate at 3.2 percent in July.
The government is expected to announce its 1996 budget plan before
the end of September, complete with measures necessary to achieve a
target deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP. The budget is likely to include
deficit reduction worth $20 billion, evenly split between new revenues
and expenditure cuts. The 1995 budget deficit is projected to be 8
percent of GDP, down from 9.7 in 1994.

Economic activity in Canada contracted in the second quarter,
after a sharp deceleration in the first quarter. Preliminary indicators
for the third quarter suggest that growth remains weak. Employment for
July and August on average was unchanged from the second quarter.
Housing starts recovered somewhat in August, but remain well below pre-

recession levels. Retail sales and manufacturing shipments declined in
July, while new orders picked up for the first time in six months.
Consumer price inflation has moderated in recent months, in large part
reflecting lower gasoline and food prices.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela remained
weak in the second quarter, while growth began to slow in Brazil. Growth
remained strong in the major Asian developing countries, although the
pace has moderated recently in some cases. In Russia, economic activity
appears to have stabilized.
The contraction in economic activity in Mexico and Argentina has
contributed to the turnaround in these countries' trade balances.
Strong export growth has also played an important role in both Mexico and
Argentina in the improved trade performance of both countries. However,
in both Brazil and Venezuela import growth was high. Exports grew
rapidly in the Asian developing countries, while import growth has been
mixed.
The continued recessions in Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela have
led to declines in their respective inflation rates, while inflation in
Brazil remains low by Brazilian standards. Inflation in the Asian
countries and in Russia continues to slow.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, economic activity fell
sharply in the second quarter. Mexican real domestic demand plummeted
21.4 percent from its year-earlier level while GDP fell 10.5 percent.
The smaller decline in GDP than in domestic demand reflected the
tremendous shift in Mexico's trade balance, with real exports (NIA
basis) rising 27 percent from a year earlier and imports declining by 30
percent. Of the components of domestic demand, gross fixed investment
fell most rapidly at 35 percent. Private consumption fell 16 percent,
while government consumption declined almost 6 percent. Industrial
production was down about 12 percent from its year-earlier level in June,
while the unemployment rate remained flat. Inflation remains high
relative to pre-crisis levels, but continues to decline in response to
depressed economic activity and the stability of the peso in foreign
exchange markets.

IV-28
Mexico's nominal trade balance has improved as well. Over the
first 7 months of 1995, exports were 32 percent above their year-earlier
level, while imports were down 7.5 percent. Based on this strong
performance, the current account registered a $455 million surplus in
the second quarter, following a revised $1,075 million deficit in the
first quarter.

Mexico's fiscal balance of the non-financial public sector
registered a surplus of about 2 percent of GDP in the first half of 1995,
while the primary surplus, which does not include public sector interest
payments, was about 6 percent of GDP. These surpluses are well in excess
of the non-financial public sector balance of 0.5 percent of GDP and
primary balance of 4.4 percent of GDP specified in Mexico's economic
program, which forms the basis for its IMF stand-by arrangement. As a
result, Mexico received a further $1.65 billion disbursement from the
IMF on August 28, raising its gross reserves to $15.2 billion as of
September 8 compared with $13.9 billion on July 31.
In late August, mounting pressure from small debtors prompted the
authorities to announce a new program that would cap interest rates paid
on small business and personal loans to below-market levels. The
government will pay the banks the difference between those rates and the
cost of funds plus a specified spread. The government hopes that the

IV-29
banks will benefit as the lower interest rates for borrowers encourage
improved loan-servicing performance.
In Argentina, consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in August from a
year earlier. The continued fall in economic activity in conjunction
with a consumption boom in Brazil have contributed to a rapid turnaround
in Argentina's trade deficit. In the first seven months of 1995, exports
rose by 44 percent over a year earlier, while imports declined by 7.6
percent. Gross international reserves fell as well and stood at $14.9
billion as of September 13, of which $1.5 billion are in dollar-
denominated Bonex bonds. The monetary base was $11.5 billion, leaving
$3.4 billion in excess reserves.

In an effort to increase credit in the economy, Argentina unified
its reserve requirements --lowering some and increasing others. In
addition, banks will now be allowed to earn interest on all of their
required reserves by investing them in a new domestic bond issued by the
Treasury, or on part of their reserves by investing in selected
international bonds such as OECD country bonds. The new "liquidity
requirements" will be phased in over the next three months and will reach
15 percent in November. Argentina issued a $1 billion yen-denominated
five-year Eurobond at an interest rate of 5.5 percent in late August.
The proceeds will be used to retire $964 million of domestic bonds. In

IV-30
mid-August, Argentina reached an agreement with the IMF on a new fiscal
target of an overall balanced budget instead of the $2 billion fiscal
surplus that was previously agreed on. The stock market fell 14 percent
between August 16 and August 30, due to fierce political infighting that
led to strong rumors that Finance Minister Cavallo would be ousted. As
of September 15, the stock market had recovered about 5 percent.
In Brazil, real GDP in the second quarter was up 5.8 percent over
its year-earlier level. However, seasonally adjusted data point to a
decline in economic activity beginning in the second quarter. Monthly
inflation has remained relatively low since the enactment of the
exchange rate-based stabilization program in July 1994.

Brazil recorded a trade balance in July, after eight months of
sizeable trade deficits. The current account deficit for the first half
of the year deteriorated to 4 percent of GDP at an annual rate from a
small deficit over the same period in 1994, reflecting mostly the near
doubling of imports. The capital account surplus was half the current
account deficit, resulting in a decline in international reserves, but
strong net capital inflows in July raised reserves past their level at
the end of 1994.
In early September, the Central Bank reduced the overnight
interest rate from 57 to 48 percent in response to the weakening of the
economy. In recent weeks, the Central Bank has also reduced reserve.0

requirements and loosened credit restrictions to help the banking
system, which has come under increased pressure since the Central Bank's
takeover of Banco Economico in mid-August.
In Venezuela, 12-month consumer price inflation was 53 percent in
August, almost unchanged from July. International reserves excluding
gold have been falling slightly recently and stood at $6.6 billion at the
end of July, down from about $7 billion at the end of June. Venezuela
registered a trade deficit of $2.7 billion for the first half of 1995, up
from a deficit of $2 billion during the same period in 1994, reflecting a
24 percent increase in imports and a 14 percent increase in exports.

On September 8, Venezuela raised its domestic gasoline price from
21.2 bolivars per gallon (12.5 cents) to a maximum of 53 bolivars (31.2
cents). On August 22, the Financial Emergency Board approved the
takeover of Banco Empresarial, a small commercial bank with about $30
million in deposits.
In China, industrial production growth and consumer price
inflation continue to slow. Exports surged in the first-half of 1995,
but in recent months export growth has slowed. Exports rose 44 percent
in the first half, but only 21 percent in July-August, compared with the
same periods a year earlier. Import growth, by contrast, has remained
roughly constant this year, rising 15 percent in the first half and 14
percent in July-August..1

In order to improve supervision of nonbank financial institutions,
China's central bank in September 1995 announced that all such
institutions must reregister and be examined within the next year. In
August, the Chinese authorities also ordered the four major state banks
to detach themselves from their nonbank financial subsidiaries. In the
past. the banks had evaded regulatory restrictions and undertaken
speculative investments through those subsidiaries.
In Taiwan, output growth remains strong, though growth was
slightly slower in the second quarter than the first. In the first eight
months of 1995, the trade surplus was down slightly from the same period
in 1994; the dollar value of exports rose 24 percent from a year earlier,
while the dollar value of imports rose 27 percent..5

Real GDP in Korea continued to expand at a rapid rate during the
second quarter, although the Bank of Korea has pursued a less
accommodative monetary policy since last fall. Despite robust growth,
consumer price inflation in August fell to its lowest rate in nearly a
decade.
Strong domestic demand, particularly for equipment investment,
contributed to a substantial widening of Korea's current account deficit
during the first seven months of 1995. Imports rose by 38 percent over
the period from a year earlier, while exports -- strengthened by the
appreciation of the Japanese yen during the first half of the year --
grew by 36 percent.

and industrial production during May-August were essentially unchanged
from their year-earlier levels, after four years of sharp decline.
Exports during the first half of 1995 were up 24 percent from the same
period last year, while imports increased by 16 percent. Monthly
inflation during August remained at 5 percent.

Since the implementation of the ruble band in early July, the MICEX
ruble-dollar exchange rate has been stable, closing at 4468 on September
19. The government announced in late August that the ruble band will
remain in place until the end of the year. Trading on the Russian
interbank ruble market is slowly recovering, following a liquidity
crisis in the end of August in which a number of banks were unable to
repay their borrowings in the interbank market. The lasting effects of
the crisis appear limited, although it revealed deep structural problems
in the interbank market.
Russia has satisfied all end-June performance criteria and all
end-July quantitative indicative targets outlined in its IMF stand-by
arrangement. The growth of the monetary aggregates during the second
quarter exceeded program projections, but the Russian government and the
IMF have agreed to a revised framework that anticipates a sharp reduction
in money growth. In mid-September, Russia completed the first quarterly
review and the fourth monthly review under the stand-by.
