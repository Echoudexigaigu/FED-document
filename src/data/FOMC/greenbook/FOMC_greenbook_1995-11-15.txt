Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Recent news on the pace of economic activity has been unusually
conflictive. The surprisingly strong advance estimate of third-
quarter GDP growth was followed by a further decline in the
unemployment rate and a jump in hours worked in October However
the tone of much of the anecdotal evidence is less robust,
and manufacturing activity appears to have contracted last month
after expanding only moderately in the third quarter The rate of
inflation has remained relatively low and stable, with firms
benefiting from decelerating labor costs.
Third-Quarter GDP
According to the advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, the growth in real GDP last quarter was $57 billion (1987
dollars) or 4.2 percent at an annual rate. BEA had to make a
number of assumptions about missing data, and the incoming
figures have deviated considerably from these assumptions.
Manufacturing inventory investment and outlays for construction were
larger than BEA wrote in, but wholesale inventory investment
declined unexpectedly. On net, as best we can estimate, these
numbers appear to point to a very slight downward revision.

We share the widespread uneasiness about the high third-quarter
number, and upcoming data--such as those on retail trade and
international trade due out next week--could significantly alter the
picture. Nonetheless, we have no compelling reason to anticipate
that GDP will be appreciably different from the advance estimate.
One consideration in this regard is that the available evidence on
the income side of the accounts does not call the published nominal
GDP figure into question, and profit reports that have been
published to date seem to support a robust estimate.
Employment and Unemployment
Moving into the fourth quarter, labor demand continued to
expand at a solid pace. Nonfarm payroll employment increased a
comparatively mild 116,000 in October, held down, in part, by the
net loss of about 23,000 strikers from the job count.2 However,
average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers jumped
0.2 hour, to 34.7 hours, pushing aggregate hours up 0.8 percent in
October. And the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage point last
month, to 5.5 percent--the lowest level since last March.
In manufacturing, the strike at Boeing by 33.000 members of the
International Association of Machinists, which began on October 6,
contributed to a decline of 21,000 jobs; adjusted for changes in
strike activity, however, the net gain was still only 5,000.3
Employment rose in lumber, fabricated metals, industrial machinery,
food, chemicals, and electronic equipment but fell in furniture,
1. Furthermore, the growth of real output when measured on a
chain-index basis is considerably lower than the 1987-based
figure and less difficult to reconcile with the data on labor
inputs.
2. In addition, September's growth in employment was revised
down 70,000, to 50,000, with transportation and services
undergoing the largest revisions.
3. About 7,000 Boeing workers began the strike one day into
the pay period and so were recorded as employed.

transportation equipment, instruments, apparel, paper, printing, and
rubber and plastics.
In other sectors, job gains were widespread. The
construction industry added 28,000 jobs in October after an upward
revised increase of 25,000 in September. Most of the recent gains
in construction have been in residential construction and in special
trades (electricians, carpenters, etc.).
Transportation and public utilities added 22,000 jobs, led by
trucking and warehousing (helped by the return of 5,000 striking
workers). Employment was also up in wholesale trade (12,000), with
most of the increase related to computers, peripherals, and
software. A small gain was recorded in retail trade (8,000), where
increases at general merchandisers (mostly department stores) and at
automotive dealers and service stations were partially offset by a
drop at eating and drinking establishments. Real estate posted
another increase (7,000), and finance employment rose 9,000 partly
because of job growth at nondepository institutions (including
mortgage bankers).
Services added 57,000 jobs last month. Computer, health,
engineering and management, auto repair, and educational services
all posted noticeable gains. However, personnel supply services
dropped back 16.000 after two months of strong increases.
Employment in hotels and in amusement and recreation services also
declined.
The October jump in average weekly hours is not unusual for
this volatile series, and such a change is often reversed the
4. The one-month diffusion index of employment change in 356
industries moved up 4 points to 54.8 in October after dropping a
similar amount in September.

following month.5 Even if all of October's increase in the
workweek is given back in November, however, aggregate hours are off
to a fast enough start to grow at a 3 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter with only moderate increases in employment. In
manufacturing, the workweek fell 0.2 hour to 41.5 hours in October;
overtime was down as well. The decline was spread among a number of
durable and nondurable manufacturing industries.6
Employment, as measured by the household survey, rose 259,000
in October, and the employment-to-population ratio edged back up to
63 percent--this ratio has changed little over the past year. The
labor force participation rate was unchanged at 66.6 percent in
October. Most of the decline in the overall unemployment rate last
month can be traced to a 0.4 percentage point decline, to
3.9 percent, in the rate for men aged 25 and over. The unemployment
rate for this group is now at its lowest level since the redesign of
the Current Population Survey in January 1994.
The Conference Board's help-wanted index fell 0.4 percentage
point in September after holding steady for the previous two months.
The index has moved within a relatively narrow range since early
1994. Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved back above
370,000, at the end of October. Initial claims in this range are
consistent with further moderate employment gains in the months
ahead.
Labor productivity, measured with output aggregated using fixed
1987 weights, rose at an annual rate of 2.0 percent in the third
quarter and was up 3.4 percent over the past four quarters. This
pace is well above its estimated trend rate of growth of
5. In October 1994, for example, the workweek also rose
0.2 hour. Then, as now, the increase appeared to be concentrated
in finance, insurance, and real estate and in services. But the
workweek dropped back to its earlier level the following month.
6. The BLS reported that the strike at Boeing had no noticeable
effect on the factory workweek.

1-1/2 percent annually, and the recent strong performance of output
per hour has pushed the level of productivity further above its
trend level (chart). In contrast, productivity growth using output
measured on a chain-weighted basis increased 0.7 percent at an
annual rate in the third quarter. Although the level of this
measure of productivity also was above trend in the third quarter,
the gap was much smaller than that using the official series (1987
prices).
Industrial Production
Industrial production slowed in September as a sharp weather-
related drop in electricity generation more than offset a modest
gain in manufacturing output. For the third quarter as a whole, the
rise in total industrial output more than reversed its second-
quarter decline. However, the rebound in manufacturing output was
more subdued--at just a 2-1/2 percent annual rate of increase--and
this left the factory utilization rate slightly below 83 percent.
Available indicators point to a further retreat in industrial
production in October; both the production worker hours and physical
product available for the initial estimate of October IP decreased
last month. Unlike September, the expected decline in October is
likely to reflect a drop in manufacturing output.
The strike at Boeing is estimated to have lowered growth in
manufacturing IP in October roughly 0.2 percentage point. Virtually
all of Boeing's commercial aircraft and parts facilities are
affected by the strike. To date, however, the strike has not
adversely affected production of parts by suppliers.
Another drag on factory output last month was the drop in the
production of motor vehicles. Weekly data indicate that

growth from using 1987 prices and measures output from the product
side, whereas the current 1987-dollar series measures output from
the income side.

manufacturers assembled motor vehicles at an 11.6 million unit rate
last month--down from the 12.0 million unit assembly rate in
September. Although production is scheduled to pick up from the
October pace over the remainder of the year, those schedules appear
slightly optimistic in light of the fact that, over the past two
months, the days' supply for automobiles and for light trucks have
each moved further above the ranges that the industry considers
"comfortable."

Outside of motor vehicles and aircraft, manufacturing activity
also apparently fell in October. Production-worker hours in
manufacturing (FRB seasonal basis) excluding transportation
equipment (most of which is motor vehicles and aircraft) declined
0.2 percent last month; the slowdown was spread widely across
industries. Producers of computing and high-technology electrical
equipment were noteworthy exceptions, continuing to post gains in
hours worked. Weekly information on physical output points to
declines in some industries, particularly appliances, lumber, steel,
meat products, and refined petroleum products.
Other recent indicators of manufacturing activity are mixed.
Real new orders for goods in the adjusted durable goods category
rose 1-3/4 percent in August and 2-1/2 percent in September,
resulting in a growth rate of 2.9 percent (annual rate) in the third

II-11
quarter. The national purchasing managers' indexes of new orders
and production, however, turned back down in October and are below
50. Nonetheless, reports from some regions, notably Philadelphia
and Chicago, suggest continued improvement in manufacturing activity
in these areas. Our most recent conversations with industry sources
provided diverse reports: Orders for high-grade paper and motor-
vehicle-related products were said to be soft, while demand for
high-technology goods and building products has been strong.
With the rate of capacity expansion running faster than
manufacturing output growth for much of this year, the factory
operating rate has dropped roughly 2-1/2 percentage points since
January, to 82.9 percent in September. Notwithstanding the further
slowdown in the manufacturing sector last month, utilization rates
in most manufacturing industries should remain above their
respective long-run averages.
After increasing at a relatively sluggish rate of 2.4 percent,
on average, over the six years ended in 1994, growth in
manufacturing capacity is currently estimated to be expanding
4.2 percent this year.8 The Investment Plans Survey (IPS), which
was updated in late September, indicated that manufacturers plan to
boost investment 24 percent in 1995 after increases that averaged
5 percent over the previous six years; the level of spending is now
well above that needed for replacement investment.
The sharp increase in aggregate manufacturing investment this
year reflects widespread gains across industries. The following
table shows capacity utilization, investment spending growth, and
manufacturing capacity growth for selected manufacturing industries.

spending include industrial machinery and equipment, electrical
machinery, and rubber and plastics products. For many producers,
the pickup in investment may reflect efforts to alleviate capacity
constraints; the table shows that industries with the greatest
increase in investment spending have experienced high operating
rates this year relative to their 1988-89 cyclical peaks. However,
some manufacturers, especially in the paper and chemical industries,
direct a notable amount of their capital expenditures toward
environmental protection.

annual rate (FRB seasonals)--were down sharply from the September
rate of 14.9 million units and well below the average pace over the
first half of the year. Two special factors account for the bulk ofManu

the decline: a reporting problem at a Japanese firm that
misallocated some October sales to September and the limited
supplies of some General Motors vehicles stemming from the car-
hauler strike that ended in early October.
Cutting through the recent gyrations in the data, sales of new
light vehicles averaged 14.6 million units in September and October,
about even with the pace set in the first half of the year. The
relative stability in sales trends this year--at a level about
1/2 million units below the 1994 pace--is also reflected in the
Michigan index for consumers' assessments of buying conditions for
cars--an indicator of underlying consumer demand. Except for an
uptick in July, that index has fluctuated in a narrow range for much
of the year, well below last year's optimistic readings.
The pace of sales this year has been relatively subdued despite
generous incentive programs that have slowed the rise in the
effective prices of motor vehicles. In the first three quarters of
1995, the average value of incentives per vehicle at Ford and
Chrysler was substantially above year-ago levels; anecdotal evidence
suggests that the same was true for Japanese makes. Incentives at
General Motors, however, trailed year-ago levels.

Prices for autos and light trucks--as measured by the CPI--rose
1.6 percent and 2.7 percent respectively over the year ended in
September, down from 3.9 and 4.6 percent over the previous twelve-
month period. Looking ahead, announced increases in sticker prices
for 1996 models appear modest--ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 percent on a
comparably equipped basis--but it remains to be seen whether the
third-quarter level of incentives will be maintained.
Consumption and Personal Income
Real consumer spending grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, a bit above the average pace during the first half of
1995. Gains were concentrated in consumer durables; growth in
spending on nondurable goods was particularly weak. The auto sales
figures and various chain store reports suggest tepid spending in
October, although anecdotal evidence points to strong demand for
home electronics. Income continued its solid uptrend through
October and presumably could support substantial spending growth in
the near term.
A jump in purchases of durable goods accounted for more than
half of the growth in total real PCE in the third quarter. Spending
in this category was boosted by a healthy gain in expenditures on
used cars. In addition, spending on electronic goods posted another
sizable increase, in part because of continued strength in purchases
of computers. Outlays for electronic goods have climbed at double-
digit rates (in 1987 dollar terms) in every quarter since the middle
of 1992.
Spending on nondurable goods was flat in the third quarter.
Real apparel outlays were unchanged, and a modest increase in food
expenditures was offset by declines in other categories.
Growth in services expenditures slowed to a 2.2 percent annual
rate in the third quarter after being boosted in the previous

quarter by a surge in energy spending. Unusually hot weather in the
third quarter caused spending on energy services to rise above its
already elevated second-quarter level. For the fourth quarter, the
available weather data indicate somewhat milder temperatures thus
far; if weather during the remainder of the quarter is about
average, the return of energy spending to more normal levels could
depress total PCE growth as much as 0.5 percentage point. Spending
on non-energy services rose 2.2 percent at an annual rate in the
third quarter, with a decline in transportation services and
moderate gains in most other categories.
Consumer spending was buttressed last quarter by fairly robust
growth in income. Real disposable income rose 4.3 percent at an
annual rate in the third quarter, pushing the saving rate up
0.2 percentage point, to 4.2 percent. The sizable gain in
disposable income was partly attributable to the timing of personal
tax payments: Payments jumped in the second quarter as some high-
income taxpayers paid some of the additional taxes associated with
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and then payments
were flat in the third quarter. In addition, pretax wages and
salaries posted a healthy advance in the third quarter. For the
current quarter, wage and salary income likely advanced
substantially in October, as indicated by the 0.8 percent increase
in aggregate private hours and 0.5 percent increase in average
hourly earnings.
Meanwhile, indicators of consumer sentiment remain in a
generally optimistic range, although recent data point to some
deterioration since the summer. The Michigan index of consumer
sentiment rose 1.3 points in October, reversing only a small portion
of its appreciable September decline. The October level of the
Conference Board index of consumer sentiment was more than 3 points

below its third-quarter average. In addition, the Michigan index of
unemployment expectations continued to climb in October; it now
stands at its highest level in two years.
Housing Markets
Housing demand and production firmed considerably in the third
quarter, reaching their highest levels since late last year.
The single-family segment of the market accounted for almost all of
the gain as multifamily construction continued flat. Of the four
regions, only the Northeast failed to post stronger housing numbers
in the third quarter than earlier in the year.
In the single-family sector, both starts and permit issuance
rose 11 percent in the third quarter. Most of the improvement came
in July, after which these indicators were essentially flat. The
higher level of construction is broadly consistent with the gains in
demand reflected in sales of new and existing homes. For the
quarter, sales in these markets rose 11 percent and 14 percent,
respectively. House prices, however, paint a more mixed picture.
In the resale market, both transactions prices and the "repeat
transactions" price index accelerated in the third quarter, but no
such pickup was apparent in new home prices.
Most early indications of housing activity in October suggest
continued strength in single-family demand. Home builders'
assessments of their current sales improved for the fourth
consecutive month, and applications for home purchase loans have
averaged higher in recent weeks. In contrast, consumers' attitudes
toward homebuying, as reported in the October Michigan survey, were
slightly less bullish than in September. Consumers viewed mortgage
9. The Conference Board index of unemployment expectations has
shown virtually no deterioration in recent months, but this index
historically has been less highly correlated with patterns of
consumer spending.

interest rates less favorably in October than September, even though
rates actually declined a bit during the month.
The generally favorable conditions for home purchase over the
past year have contributed to a rise in the home ownership rate. In
the third quarter, 65.0 percent of all households were homeowners.
up more than 1 percentage point from early 1994 and the highest
level since the early 1980s. Ownership has increased among both
young adults and the elderly.
Multifamily construction has not contributed much to the recent
strengthening in housing activity. Starts of these units, about
80 percent of which are rental apartments, increased in the third
quarter but did not reverse the declines recorded earlier in the
year. No market tightening was evident in vacancy rates and rents
in the third quarter, despite the continuing low level of
production. Mobile home shipments this year, meanwhile, have been
the highest since 1974, surpassing multifamily starts by 20 percent.
Improved product design and robust growth in some key southern
markets appear to have contributed to the doubling of shipments
since 1991.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment in both equipment and structures
decelerated in the third quarter. The moderation of growth in these
categories is not surprising, given the movements of the fundamental
determinants of BFI over the past few quarters. The cost of
capital--which has benefited from lower interest rates and declining
capital goods prices--has continued to decline, but accelerator and
cash flow effects have worked to slow investment growth in recent
quarters. Nevertheless, fundamentals still appear supportive of
strong investment; indeed the most recent reading on profits

indicates that the downward pressure from slackened growth in cash
flow may have eased in the third quarter.10
After dropping sharply in July, orders and shipments of
nondefense capital goods posted solid gains in August and September.
Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft advanced
2.2 percent in September, with both office and computing and other
equipment moving up. However, for the third quarter as a whole,
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts
increased 1.1 percent, a slower pace than that of the previous two
quarters.
Despite rising 7.0 percent in September, orders for nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft and parts were down slightly in the
third quarter and failed to keep pace with shipments.1 As a
result, the rapid accumulation of backlogs during the past few years
appears to have subsided.
The strike at Boeing is likely to lower aircraft deliveries in
the fourth quarter, although our industry contacts suggest some
shipments (including exports) will proceed. Elsewhere, McDonnell
Douglas reported large commercial orders from Saudi Arabia and from
Valujet. Although these orders will not affect output significantly
in the near term, they are important milestones because many
analysts have been predicting that McDonnell would be forced by weak
orders to abandon commercial aircraft construction.
Outlays for motor vehicles were fairly strong in the third
quarter, mostly because of a temporary surge in business purchases
of light motor vehicles as automakers unloaded model-year-end
10. Assuming that the statistical discrepancy remained constant,
real corporate cash flow advanced at an annual rate of more than
20 percent in the third quarter. Because the influence of cash
flow is subject to lags, this would tend to boost investment in
the following few quarters.
11. A good part of the September increase was attributable to
sharp rebounds in two volatile categories: communications
equipment and railroad equipment.

inventories onto their fleet customers. Sales of heavy trucks
declined 2.8 percent in September and dropped 9.5 percent for the
third quarter as a whole. Manufacturers have reported many
cancellations of existing orders, and heavy truck purchases have
clearly entered a downswing.
Outlays for nonresidential structures were estimated by the BEA
12to have advanced only 3 percent in the third quarter.2 However,
construction data received since the advance GDP release imply that
real NRS growth will be revised upward to an annual rate of
7 percent.3 Nonetheless, the movements of permits for new
nonresidential buildings appear to point to growth in construction
in the coming months that will be slower than we have seen over the
past few years. Permit issuance varied greatly from the second
quarter to the third quarter in the various categories, but--
smoothing through the ups and downs--the strong recent uptrend in
permits,for new construction appears to have leveled off.
Business Inventories
In the advance GDP estimate for the third quarter, BEA assumed
real nonfarm inventory investment of $36.8 billion at an annual
rate. Census book-value data released so far suggest
a lower rate of accumulation. Based on the book-value data,
we expect a modest downward revision of $6.5 billion to real nonfarm
inventory investment in the third quarter. However, the retail
12. Construction of office buildings and lodging and
miscellaneous structures surged, but industrial construction
dropped back a bit, while other commercial construction recovered
most of the ground lost in the second quarter.
13. Real spending for commercial structures appears to have
risen more rapidly than previously estimated, and the estimated
decline in industrial building has been largely erased.

inventory data for September, to be released on November 15, might
14well alter this estimate.
Manufacturers' inventories rose $29 billion at an annual rate
in September after a modest increase in August. Stocks of capital
goods--in particular telecommunications equipment and electronic
components--continued to expand rapidly, apparently reflecting the
robust equipment orders and shipments in recent months. Outside of
capital goods, however, the accumulation of factory stocks in August
and September was well below the pace observed during the second
quarter. Inventories at many material-producing industries,
including primary metals, chemicals, and rubber and plastics, have
posted relatively small net changes since July; inventories held by
producers of home goods and apparel also showed only modest
increases.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories were reduced in both
August and September following substantial buildups in the preceding
months. Stocks of motor vehicles and auto accessories fell further
in September; nonauto inventories also posted widespread declines.
In contrast to developments in manufacturing, stocks of machinery
and equipment held by wholesalers were drawn down in September,
although for the quarter as a whole they showed a net accumulation.
In the retail sector, inventories at most types of stores
expanded significantly in August following drawdowns in July. A
sharp runup in stocks at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture
and appliance outlets (GAF) lifted the inventory-sales ratio for
this wide range of stores to a relatively high 2.38 months.
However, given the gain in GAF sales shown in the September advance
14. The staff's estimated revision to 1987-dollar manufacturing
and wholesale trade inventory investment (excluding motor
vehicles) is larger than the revisions to the book-value
inventory figures underlying BEA's advance estimate. The
difference reflects a tilt in the composition of recent inventory
investment toward items with relatively large price increases.

report, the inventory position for stores in this broad category may
have improved since August.
By and large, the pace of inventory investment in the latter
part of the third quarter was in line with growth in shipments and
sales, and inventory-sales ratios for most types of businesses in
manufacturing and trade remained within the ranges that prevailed
over the past year.
Federal Sector
Real federal purchases increased 4.9 percent at an annual rate
in the third quarter, according to BEA's advance estimate. Real
defense purchases rose at a 2.1 percent annual rate, despite a small
decline in nominal spending. In large part, the rise in real
spending reflects a marked shift in the composition of nominal
purchases toward computers, whose deflator is lower than
15average. The third-quarter surge notwithstanding, real defense
purchases fell 6.6 percent for fiscal 1995, only slightly less than
the 7.2 percent decline posted in fiscal 1994 (chart).
Real federal purchases were also boosted in the third quarter
by a 10.2 percent (annual rate) increase in real nondefense
purchases. This growth was primarily a result of a jump in spending
for noncompensation services. However, real nondefense purchases
are quite volatile, and this third-quarter increase merely raised
real nondefense purchases to slightly above their recent average
level after a drop in the second quarter. Indeed, real nondefense
purchases have been approximately flat over the past four years.
The unified budget deficit for fiscal 1995 was $164 billion, a
$39 billion decline from the $203 billion deficit posted in fiscal
1994. Fiscal 1995 receipts from spectrum auctions accounted for
15. A significantly smaller factor contributing to the decline
in the deflator for defense purchases was the delivery of two
satellites in the second quarter and none in the third quarter;
satellites have a higher-than-average deflator.

almost $8 billion of the decline. Another $10 billion results from
lower net deposit insurance outlays. Excluding these factors and
adjusting for shifts in the timing of payments between fiscal years,
the deficit fell $16 billion.16
Compared with fiscal 1994, receipts rose 7 percent last year
and timing-adjusted outlays (outlays excluding deposit insurance and
spectrum auction proceeds) increased 5 percent. Most receipt
categories showed strong growth; individual income taxes were up
9 percent, and corporate tax receipts were up 12 percent. On the
outlay side, growth was led by net interest payments, which rose
14 percent. Health-related spending for Medicare and Medicaid was
up almost 10 percent. Income security outlays increased only
3 percent, reflecting favorable economic developments. Spending
restraint was provided by defense, which fell 2 percent.
The fiscal 1995 deficit was $4 billion higher than the
Administration's mid-session review had anticipated in July but
$29 billion below the deficit projection in the President's February
budget. Similarly, the fiscal 1995 deficit was $3 billion higher
than CBO's midyear deficit estimate released in August but
$12 billion below CBO's January estimate.
September contains one of the four "due dates" for estimated
individual and corporate tax payments, and these payments normally
are a useful indicator of total tax liabilities for the year.
Individual nonwithheld tax payments for September were more than
9 percent higher than a year earlier. Moreover, gross corporate
payments were almost 17 percent above September of last year.
16. Military pay, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and
veterans benefits scheduled to be paid on the first of the month
are shifted into the previous month if the first falls on a
weekend. For both fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1996, the first day of
the fiscal year--October 1--fell on a weekend, so these payments
were shifted into the previous fiscal year.

II-38
Even though the new fiscal year began on October 1, a
substantial amount of work on the fiscal 1996 budget remains to be
done. A continuing resolution signed by the President on
September 30 avoided a government shutdown when none of the thirteen
appropriations bills, which provide annual funding for most
discretionary spending programs, had been signed into law by the
beginning of fiscal 1996. The resolution funds currently ongoing
discretionary government programs between October 1 and November 13
if the pertinent appropriation bill has not been enacted. 17 As
of November 7 the President had signed only two appropriations bills
(Agriculture and Military Construction) and vetoed one (Legislative
Branch). A complete set of the appropriations bills will not be
signed into law by November 13. A second continuing resolution
extending funding through December 1 for programs covered by the
eleven unsigned appropriations bills is being considered by
Congress.18
Both the House and Senate have passed their respective versions
of a budget reconciliation bill, which proposes the legislative
changes to mandatory spending programs and tax laws designed to meet
the guidelines of the budget resolution. A House-Senate conference
is working currently to resolve the differences between the bills.
17. In general, the resolution funds programs at a provisional
level equal to 95 percent of the average annual funding in the
Senate and House versions of the appropriations bills. However,
most programs that would have their funding "significantly
reduced" under this funding formula can have their funding rate
increased to 90 percent of the fiscal 1995 level, and adequate
funding is assured to avoid worker layoffs. The staff estimates
that the current resolution, if extended at similar terms, would
reduce nominal discretionary spending by approximately $15 billion
(annual rate) in 1995:Q4 relative to the level set by the
discretionary spending caps enacted in the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993.
18. This pending resolution would set spending at the House or
Senate versions of the spending bills or at last year's level,
whichever is lowest. However, no program would be funded below
60 percent of its current level, and sufficient funding is allowed
to avoid layoffs.

II-39
Republicans in the Congress appear to remain committed to keeping
debt-limit legislation tied to the budget reconciliation bill.
The Congress is considering a bill to temporarily raise federal
borrowing authority by $67 billion through December 12 to allow time
for the Congress and the President to continue work on budget
legislation without forcing Treasury to default when the debt limit
is hit and its cash balances are depleted. The bill also contains
restrictions on Treasury's authority to disinvest or underinvest
government trust funds and provides authority for the continuation
of certain benefit payments in the event of a Treasury default.
State and Local Government Sector
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local
governments were estimated by BEA to have risen at a 2.1 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, about the same as in the second
quarter. Within that total, real construction spending was
initially estimated to have risen at a 3.5 percent pace in the third
quarter, but will likely be revised upward when BEA incorporates the
monthly data on construction put in place in September. The
revision may bring growth in total state and local purchases in the
third quarter to 3 percent, making this the strongest gain in a
year. State and local government employment increased 55,000 in the
third quarter, the largest advance since the fourth quarter of last
year. In October, employment rose just 6,000; sizable declines were
reported among education workers at both the state and the local
levels for the second consecutive month.
Heightened concern about both revenue growth and future cuts in
federal aid has raised questions about the budget assumptions of
many state and local governments. Most states based their fiscal
1996 budget on the assumption that federal aid would not be altered,
but they now face likely cuts in aid and a consolidation of programs

into block grants. Regarding revenue, the growth in tax bases
appears to be slowing. Notably, consumption and taxable income--
considered indicators of state and local tax bases--rose at an
annual rate of about 4.5 percent over the first three quarters of
this year, compared with gains of 6 to 7 percent during the
preceding year. Among the largest states, California, Illinois, New
Jersey, and New York incorporated particularly optimistic
assumptions about revenue. Meanwhile, budget difficulties continue
to be foreshadowed by structural imbalances, especially in states
like Florida and Texas, where both the population and public-school
enrollment have risen.
Prices
Inflation remained modest in September. The overall CPI
increased 0.1 percent, the same as in August, and the September
increase in the CPI excluding food and energy was 0.2 percent, the
fifth consecutive increase of this size. Over the twelve months
ended in September, the overall CPI rose 2.5 percent, down from a
3.0 percent increase over the preceding twelve months, while the CPI
excluding food and energy increased 2.9 percent in the latest
twelve-month period, little changed from the 3.0 percent increase in
the preceding twelve months.
The CPI for energy fell 1.4 percent in September, its third
consecutive decline. A large drop in gasoline prices over the past
three months--reflecting the reversal of a bulge in crude oil prices
in the spring--accounted for most of the decline in energy prices in
the third quarter. But utility rates also fell as natural gas
prices continued the downtrend that began in 1994. Food prices
increased 0.5 percent in September, the largest increase since
April. The increase was concentrated in prices of fresh vegetables,

which are very erratic. Increases in other food prices, at just
0.2 percent, were in line with increases over the past year.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy increased
0.1 percent in September after a 0.4 percent increase in August.
Over the twelve months ended in September, the index for nonfood,
non-energy goods has increased 1.5 percent, less than the rise over
the preceding year. Over the past twelve months, prices of new
motor vehicles have increased less rapidly than in the preceding
twelve-month period. Apparel prices have continued to decelerate;
soft demand has also likely been a factor here. Prices of
housekeeping supplies have increased more rapidly over the past
year, reflecting the pass-through to the consumer level of large
increases early this year in paper and chemical prices at early
stages of processing.
The rise in the CPI for services other than energy. 0.3 percent
in September, was in line with the average pace over the past two
years. Medical care prices, which decelerated sharply from 1990 to
1994, have increased at about a 5 percent pace in each of the past
two years. The latest twelve-month change in airfares (2.4 percent)
masks considerable gyration over the year; fares have fallen about
5 percent over the past three months after increasing more than 20
percent in the first six months of the year.
Over the past twelve months, the PPI for personal computers has
fallen rapidly--down 25 percent. These price declines are in line
with anecdotal evidence on changes in "street prices." In
contrast, the PPI for personal computers fell at only a
4-1/2 percent annual rate in the first half of 1994 even though
advertised mail-order prices of personal computers were falling at a
rate of at least 15 percent. At the time, we noted that the
discrepancy was probably the result of an out-of-date sample of

computers. Conversations with BLS analysts suggest that the agency
has recently done a better job of keeping its sample of computers up
to date with the mix of products in the marketplace.
Pressures on materials prices have eased considerably since the
spring. Over the past five months, the PPI for intermediate
materials other than food and energy has increased at a 2.1 percent
annual rate, down from a 7.8 percent increase over the preceding
twelve-month period. The easing in intermediate materials prices
likely reflects the drop-off in capacity utilization rates since the
beginning of the year.
Prices of industrial commodities were slightly lower during
most of the period since the last Greenbook; in recent weeks, some
commodities have regained much of their price declines. The Journal
of Commerce index is little changed from its level in late
September. Copper cathode prices have been quite volatile this
year, and, while having dropped in the past few weeks, were still at
about their level at the beginning of the year. The price of
aluminum now stands about 13 percent below its level at the
beginning of the year. Steel scrap prices have retreated since mid-
September and are currently near year-ago levels; the recent
declines are consistent with other indicators of sluggishness in
manufacturing. In addition, news in the trade press indicates that
exports--especially to Asia--have weakened recently, after surging
earlier this year.
In the farm sector, prices of crop commodities have moved still
higher since mid-September, boosted by further markdowns in
estimates of this year's harvest. Corn prices in recent days have
been at levels about 70 percent above those of a year earlier, and
prices of wheat and soybeans have also increased substantially.
Livestock prices have been mixed of late, with cattle prices

rebounding from summer lows and hog prices moving down more rapidly
than is implied by normal seasonal patterns.
History offers mixed signals as to how much of an effect this
year's sharp run-up in crop prices might ultimately have on farm and
food prices further down the line (see table). For example, in each
of three other recent episodes in which prices of feed grains and
oilseeds were pushed up by poor harvests--those of 1983, 1988, and
1993--responses in livestock prices displayed considerable
variation, rising modestly in the first episode, soaring in the
second, and declining sharply in the third.
Consumer food prices eventually accelerated in all three
episodes--at least if measured from the year preceding the poor crop
to the year after the poor crop--but the timing varied, and in two
of the three episodes the degree of acceleration left food prices
still rising at a rate less than the rate of core inflation. The
minimal acceleration in retail food prices in all three cases,
measured relative to the surge in crop prices, is probably in large
part a reflection of the dominance of nonfarm inputs in value added
in the food sector.
The duration of the surge in crop prices in all three cases was
limited by a rebound in production in the following year. As for
the current episode, recent configurations of futures prices suggest
that traders anticipate higher crop production and a downturn in
crop prices in 1996. At this point, however, with the usual
production rebound still uncertain--and with traders fairly bullish
about the prospects for farm exports--the markets also appear to be
betting on only a partial reversal of the large price advances of
the past year.

Labor Costs
The employment cost index (ECI) measure of hourly compensation
for private industry workers rose 2.3 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter, bringing the gain over the past twelve months to
2.6 percent. The rise during the same period of a year ago was
3.3 percent. In the past year, growth in hourly compensation has
slowed or been little changed in almost all major occupations and
industries. The few exceptions include service occupations
(security guards, food service workers, barbers, etc.) and the
wholesale trade, real estate, and securities/nonbanking financial
industries.
Most of the deceleration in growth of ECI hourly compensation
over the past year continues to reflect the dramatic slowing in the
benefits component. While growth in hourly wages and salaries has
held relatively steady at a bit under 3 percent, hourly benefit
costs have decelerated from a 4 percent pace over the twelve months
ended in September 1994 to a 2.1 percent pace over the most recent
twelve-month period. Health insurance costs, which were essentially
unchanged over the past twelve months, can account for about one-
half of the slowing in benefits growth. The deceleration in the
costs of health care has also contributed to the decline in
employers' costs for workers' compensation--a legally required
benefit--which fell 2.3 percent over the twelve months ended in
September. In addition, employer costs for state unemployment
insurance declined 2.9 percent over the same period, reflecting the
effect of fewer layoffs on firms' experience ratings.
Another measure of hourly compensation growth is available in
the productivity and cost data--nonfarm hourly compensation. Unlike
ECI hourly compensation, nonfarm hourly compensation does not have
fixed weights. Which weighting scheme is desirable depends upon the

use of the data. But one clear disadvantage of the nonfarm
compensation measure is that recent estimates of benefits costs are
essentially extrapolations. The wages and salaries component is
also subject to substantial revision as more complete information
comes in over several years. That said, nonfarm hourly compensation
rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter--down
from 3.7 percent in the second quarter. Over the four quarters
ended in 1995:Q3, nonfarm hourly compensation rose 3.7 percent. In
contrast to the ECI measure, this is up from 2.6 percent over the
preceding four quarters. The difference in the patterns of hourly
compensation growth between the two series may result in part from
the fact that recent information on benefit costs in nonfarm
compensation may not capture the dramatic slowing in health care
costs or legally required benefits that has occurred over the past
year.
The only major piece of wage data for the fourth quarter is one
month's reading on average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent in
October. Perhaps more telling, however, is that average hourly
earnings rose 3.0 percent over the twelve months ended in October--
about the same as the 3.1 percent increase over the previous twelve
months. After having run somewhat lower than the ECI (for a
comparable subset of workers) for much of 1993 and 1994, average
hourly earnings have risen faster than ECI in recent quarters.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The Treasury yield curve flattened over the intermeeting period
as market participants drew encouragement from signs of subdued
inflation and indications that, despite harsh words from both sides
and threats of debt default, substantial deficit reduction still
lies ahead. Even publication of a surprisingly high third-quarter
GDP estimate and a firm October employment report failed to shake
the general view that the economy is currently on a moderate growth
path that would leave room for further Fed easing. That view has
been strongly reinforced by comments of System officials.
Short-term rates are about unchanged to down slightly after
accounting for year-end effects, while longer-term rates are down
25 to 35 basis points. The thirty-year Treasury yield touched
6-1/4 percent, a level last seen in January 1994, just prior to the
onset of System tightening.
The decision to leave short-term rates unchanged at the
September FOMC meeting was widely anticipated, and had little market
impact. Quotes on federal funds futures and Eurodollar futures are
consistent with an expectation of a 1/4 point easing in the coming
months, with another quarter point indicated by next spring. Money
market yields imply financing rates for the long weekend at year-end
of about 6-1/4 to 7-1/2 percent, suggesting somewhat smaller
premiums than in recent years, although year-end premiums are much
larger for the troubled Japanese banking sector.
Private rates generally declined less than Treasury yields,
resulting in a widening of some spreads, most notably on lower-rated
instruments. Stock prices were quite volatile over the last six
weeks, as investors nervously scanned third-quarter earnings reports
for signs of a downturn in corporate profitability. In the event,
third-quarter earnings reports more often than not came in on the

while inflows to long-term mutual funds continued at their brisk
third-quarter pace. Meanwhile, the downtrend in private sector debt
growth appeared to continue. Household borrowing has slowed, with
consumer installment credit growth coming in at 6-1/2 percent for
September, and bank consumer lending figures hinting that the pace
in October may have remained below that observed earlier in the
year. Business credit appears to have expanded at about the same
pace or perhaps a bit slower than in September, as reduced borrowing
from banks and in the commercial paper market was offset at least in
part by a rate-induced pickup in bond issuance. State and local
government debt continued to contract, owing to heavy retirements
alongside moderate gross issuance.
Absent an increase in the debt ceiling, the Treasury is
projected to exhaust its borrowing authority and deplete its cash
balances by November 15. Given the uncertainty, the Treasury has
had to postpone its midquarter refunding auction. Even if a
temporary increase in the ceiling were enacted, it may not come soon
enough for the Treasury to be able to sell its midquarter refunding
notes on schedule. In that event, the Treasury would have to make
do with stop-gap sales of cash management bills.
Money and Bank Credit
M1 declined at an 11 percent annual rate in October (table), as
programs that sweep funds out of other checkable deposits and into
MMDAs spread to four additional bank holding companies. These sweep

III-4
programs, now used by fifteen bank holding companies, pulled down Ml
growth by about 7 percentage points in October, and have shaved
about 3 percentage points from its growth, on average, since the
fourth quarter of 1994. M2, which is unaffected by OCD sweeps, was
flat in October, as the growth of M2 components outside of Ml also
slowed significantly after their third-quarter burst. Notably,
growth in retail money market mutual funds fell to a 10 percent rate
from a 17-1/2 percent pace in September and a torrid 23-1/2 percent
average rate of increase over the year to date.
M3 growth eased to about a 4 percent annual rate, leaving that
aggregate just above its growth cone. The slowing in its M2
component was offset partly by continued rapid growth of
institution-only money funds. In addition, large time deposits
surged as domestic and foreign banks apparently shifted to domestic
funding sources, while net balances due to foreign offices declined.
Growth of M3 was likely held down by a sharp deceleration in
bank credit in October (table). The slowdown was broad-based,
reflecting sluggish growth in loans and a decline in security
holdings. Business loans outstanding were flat in October. While
the slackening in overall business lending may be signaling a less
rapid pace of inventory accumulation, it was presumably in part a
reflection of competition from the capital markets. Issuance of
bonds and stocks was brisk last month; moreover, the slowdown in
loans was concentrated at large banks as well as at branches and
agencies of foreign banks, the lenders that compete most directly
with capital markets. In support of this view, respondents to the
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in November reported an easing of
their business loan terms, on balance, as well as a slight increase
in their willingness to lend. The data do not point to significant
relative weakness of business loans at Japanese branches, though

reports suggest that the rising cost of funds for these institutions
is discouraging some lending by them.
Consumer loans outstanding on bank balance sheets fell slightly
in October. Even after adjusting for securitizations, consumer
loans grew at "only" a 8-1/2 percent pace, less than two-thirds the
pace posted in the last few quarters. The Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey suggests that, on balance, banks have not reduced
their willingness to lend to consumers in recent months, and that
demand by households has not slackened.
Preliminary data indicate that banks remained highly profitable
in the third quarter. Profits were boosted by a $1-1/2 billion
refund of deposit insurance premiums resulting from the reduction in
deposit premium rates put in place in August, but effective
retroactively to June. Respondents to the August Senior Loan
Officer Opinion Survey indicated that most of the premium reduction
would likely flow through to the bottom line rather than being
passed through as higher deposit rates or lower loan rates. In
addition to the refund, third-quarter earnings benefited from
continued rapid growth in loans, which allowed banks to preserve
their net interest margins by increasing the loan share of assets.
Bank stock prices outperformed the market by a significant
margin over the third quarter, perhaps sparked by the rapid pace of
merger activity in the industry. In mid-October, however, bank
stock prices--and those of other lending institutions--retraced some
of those gains, as investors reportedly began to focus on incipient
signs of deterioration in the quality of consumer loan portfolios
cropping up in some lenders' financial reports.

(table), and October issuance strengthened further with the decline
in long-term rates. Public offerings of junk bonds jumped to
$3.4 billion in September, the highest monthly total this year, and
remained strong in October. The weak growth of bank loans and
commercial paper (chart)--as well as comments from market
participants--suggests that some corporations have used bond
proceeds to pay down commercial paper and bank loans. On balance,
it appears that business borrowing has remained moderate.
Spreads on investment-grade bonds have widened several basis
points of late, reflecting a more cautious tone in the market
(chart, lower panel). Junk bond spreads have widened substantially
more, about 15 to 35 basis points over the intermeeting period,
resulting in year-to-date increases of as much as 100 basis points,
perhaps in part the result of supply pressures. The pace of junk
bond defaults this year, at 2.4 percent of outstanding debt,
represents an increase over the experience of the last couple of
years, though it remains below its average in the late 1980s. In
the past few months, defaults appear to have been disproportionately
concentrated in the retail sector, which has experienced a spate of
bankruptcies this year. Retailers--specialty and discount stores in
particular--have suffered from stiff price competition and
relatively mild growth in retail sales.
The volume of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding
increased moderately in September and October. As in earlier
months, considerable gross issuance was partially offset by paydowns
of merger-related paper. AT&T was a heavy issuer in September, to
finance its acquisition of LIN Broadcasting and, reportedly, to
boost the interest-sensitivity of its debt used to finance its
variable-rate credit card receivables. Reflecting funding pressures
faced by lower-quality borrowers at the end of the quarter, the

thirty-day A2/P2 quality spread rose sharply in late September and
then fell in October.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations in
September and October reached the highest level in nearly two years.
In addition, there remain a large number of issues in registration.
As has been the case all year, technology issues have accounted for
an unusually large share of total issuance (chart, top panel),
fueled by the strong first-half performance of technology stocks
(middle panel). Issuance tends to lag share price increases by
about a quarter as a result of delays between the filing of the
registration statement and the completion of the offering. In
addition to computer-related stocks, new issues of medical-related
companies were well-received in the third quarter after encountering
several years of lackluster investor demand.
Nonfinancial firms issuing stock this year have been mostly
companies that have no public debt outstanding or that are rated as
speculative grade. Through October, outside of utilities, only
seven investment-grade nonfinancial companies tapped the stock
market for capital this year, accounting for just $2.3 billion, or
6 percent, of gross equity issuance. In the current environment,
with strong earnings and ample liquidity, investment-grade firms are
more likely to repurchase stock than to issue new shares. Announced
repurchase programs in the third quarter exceeded $15 billion for
the fifth consecutive quarter (chart, lower panel).
The strong pace of merger and acquisition activity by
nonfinancial corporations has also resulted in significant share
retirements, despite a heavy reliance on stock swaps. Megamergers--
those mergers in which the target company is valued at more than
$1 billion--resulted in $15 billion of equity retirements in the
third quarter, up from a $9 billion pace in the first two quarters.

III-12
Smaller mergers resulted in additional retirements of $10.5 billion
in the third quarter. In the current quarter to date, retirements
from completed megamergers have already reached $12 billion, and a
large volume of projected retirements from announced but-not-yet-
completed deals remains. With some of these deals expected to close
by year-end, and with the high level of share repurchases expected
to continue, net equity issuance should remain decidedly negative in
the current quarter.
The credit quality of nonfinancial companies, as measured by
Moody's, improved in the third quarter, with the value of debt
upgraded exceeding the value of debt downgraded by $18 billion.
Much of the increase was due to the upgrading of $14 billion of IBM
debt, reflecting the success of the company's cost-cutting efforts.
Among financial companies, the most notable rating change involved
the upgrade on $30 billion of Citicorp debt.
To date, third-quarter earnings have exceeded analysts'
expectations by about 3 percent on a weighted-average basis.
Positive surprises have outnumbered negative surprises by nearly two
to one, with financial companies and utilities having an especially
strong quarter relative to analyst predictions. Earnings at
utilities were fueled by the hot summer weather, and at commercial
banks, as noted, by the decline in deposit insurance premiums.
Excluding financial companies and utilities, positive surprises also
outnumbered negative surprises, though by a smaller margin. Early
in October, disappointing third-quarter earnings announcements by
Motorola, Novell, and some other technology companies triggered
declines in technology share prices and led analysts to lower
fourth-quarter earnings estimates. In retrospect, it appears that
companies with the weakest third-quarter earnings released their

III-13
earnings early or gave advance warning in an effort to soften the
market's reaction.
Though quite volatile over the period, most major market
indexes are now only slightly above their level at the last FOMC,
and share prices of computer and software firms are up 3 to
5 percent. Also leading the market have been housing-related
shares; in contrast, stocks in most other cyclically sensitive
sectors have suffered declines.
Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities were sluggish
in September but bounced up in October, owing primarily to a handful
of large issues and a notable increase in refunding bonds (table).
Through the end of October, gross offerings have run about
16 percent below the rate for the same period last year. The
decline mainly reflects a drop in refunding activity, although
issuance to fund new capital projects also was somewhat below last
year's pace. Retirements of refunded and maturing bonds have

continued to be heavy during the intermeeting period, and net
issuance was negative in both September and October. Indeed, the
stock of outstanding long-term tax-exempt bonds is expected to
decline about $65 billion in 1995 as a result of heavy retirements
and the low gross volume of new bonds.
Ratios of tax-exempt to taxable yields changed little over the
intermeeting period (chart). For one-year securities, the ratio of
AAA tax-exempt to Treasuries hovered near its average of the past
few years, while the ratio for thirty-year AAA debt remained quite
elevated at about 0.88. The high ratio for longer maturity debt
owes largely to continuing discussion of tax reform proposals that
would reduce or eliminate the tax advantage of income from municipal
bonds. However, because any major change of the tax system is
unlikely to take effect for a while, short-term municipal yields
have not moved up.
Standard and Poor's downgraded almost $55 billion of municipal
debt during the third quarter and upgraded only $3 billion (chart).
However, almost $23 billion of the downgraded debt was confined to
municipal utility companies, which have faced sharply increased
competition in some regions as a result of recent measures to
deregulate the electric power industry. S&P downgraded more than
$25 billion of New York City's general obligation debt because of
chronic budget problems and continued high debt levels. S&P also
downgraded more than $5 billion of Los Angeles County debt in
response to the county's large deficit for fiscal year 1996. The
downgrades of New York City and Los Angeles County were widely
anticipated by market participants and had little effect on their
funding costs. In fact, both issuers raised significant amounts
with little apparent trouble subsequent to the ratings actions.

Excluding the utilities, New York City, and Los Angeles County, only
$2.5 billion of debt was downgraded.
As part of its strategy to remain below the current federal
debt ceiling, the Treasury Department stopped taking orders for the
sale of the state and local government series (SLGS) on October 18.
These nonmarketable Treasury securities are used mainly as
investments for the escrowed proceeds of advance refunding issues.
Although they yield slightly less than marketable Treasuries, they
can be tailored to match issuers' exact maturity and interest rate
needs and thereby ease compliance with the "no arbitrage"
restrictions on such issues. Temporary suspension of sales of
SLGS will probably have only a limited effect on refunding issuance
because recent overall demand for SLGS has been fairly low.
Refunding activity has been relatively light this year; moreover,
many recent issuers reportedly have purchased open-market Treasuries
rather than SLGS.
Treasury Financing
The debt subject to statutory limit is estimated to have been
$4,896.5 billion by the end of October, $3.5 billion shy of the debt
ceiling. On October 17, facing the prospect of exceeding its
statutory borrowing authority by the end of October, the Treasury
announced a sharp cutback in the size of that week's three-month
bill auction. To avoid worsening the shortage of that bill, the
Federal Reserve rolled over only $5.4 billion of the $6.3 billion of
the System's maturing Treasury holdings at that week bill's auction.
Nevertheless, this supply shortage was reflected in the price of the
three-month bill, with its yield about 5 to 10 basis points below
the smoothed bill yield curve for about a week. This supply effect

any earnings on escrowed investments above what it is paying on the
new, refunding bond.

III-18
has since disappeared, in part as it became clear to market
participants that this bill would be reopened as a cash management
bill.
In addition to suspending the sale of special issues to state
and local governments, the Treasury halted the practice of issuing
foreign add-ons at bill and note auctions, and has already called in
the $2.3 billion of deposits held at depository institutions as
compensating balances. The cut in bills permitted the Treasury to
announce normal sizes and a timely settlement of end-of-October two-
and five-year notes, as well as of two cash management bills
totaling $14 billion, which were issued on November 3 when seasonal
redemptions of nonmarketable debt held by government trust funds
occurred. On November 6, the Treasury announced that it had to
postpone the regular midquarter refunding auctions, stated to be
held on November 7 and November 8, because Congress had not
completed action on legislation to temporarily increase the
statutory debt limit. The postponed auctions included $18 billion
of three-year notes and $13.5 billion of ten-year notes. If a debt
ceiling extension occurs any later than November 8 or November 9,
then the settlement of the midquarter refunding would most likely
have to be postponed. In this case, the Treasury is likely to raise
new money by issuing a very short-term cash management bill
structured so that it expires the same day the rescheduled
midquarter refunding is to settle.
Absent an increase in the debt ceiling, the Treasury probably
would deplete its cash balances and run out of borrowing authority
by November 15 if it does not resort to gimmicks used in previous
debt ceiling crises, such as underinvestment of trust funds to meet
current outlays from such funds and replace them temporarily with

III-19
the issuance of special obligations that do not count as statutory
debt under the borrowing constraints.
The staff forecast for Treasury financing in the fourth quarter
assumes that there will be a permanent resolution to the debt-
ceiling problem, without a default, by mid-December. In that
forecast, the federal government is expected to finance the
projected $66 billion fourth-quarter fiscal deficit partly by
borrowing $53 billion from the public and by drawing down its cash
balance by $12 billion. With no long-term bond scheduled for the
upcoming midquarter refunding, the Treasury will rely on bills for
half of the funds raised this quarter. It is also expected that the
Treasury will auction four cash management bills, raising $28
billion, to help bridge upcoming seasonal financial needs.
Agency Financing
Net borrowing by government-sponsored enterprises contracted
slightly in the third quarter, and average spreads on GSE debt in
the secondary market have widened slightly over the intermeeting
period. Although the agencies continue to issue new debt, much of it
is to fund outstanding debt being called to lower financing costs.
About 85 percent of the new agency debt is callable. Borrowing by
GSEs in the global bond market slowed considerably in September,
after an active summer.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has recently undertaken
several steps to improve its financial condition, in part a response
to a critical report issued by the Government Accounting Office
(GAO). In 1994, the TVA's debt servicing costs ($1.9 billion)
amounted to 35 percent of its revenues, or about double the debt
service burden at neighboring utilities. Moreover, its nonproducing
assets--largely nuclear power plants not in operation--have been
treated as deferred assets so that the associated costs have not

been included in operating costs nor reflected in the TVA's
electricity rates. The GAO views the high debt servicing costs and
the large size of deferred assets as key factors that will put the
TVA at a competitive disadvantage.
Of late, the TVA has substantially reduced the number of
employees and has also refinanced some debt at a lower costs.
However, there are few remaining areas for the TVA to reduce its
costs. While the TVA is not currently facing any cash-flow
problems, the GAO expects that, if the TVA's capital expenditures
continue to exceed its net cash from operations to the tune of $1
billion annually, as occurred in 1994, the federal government "may
be at risk for some portion of TVA's $26 billion debt."
Mortgage Markets
The commitment rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped
to 7.38 percent in late October, its lowest level in eighteen
months, before retracing slightly. On balance, last week it was
down about 13 basis points from the reading in the week of the
September FOMC meeting. The average initial rate on ARMs indexed to
the one-year Treasury constant maturity yield has declined about
10 basis points on balance over the period, and the initial rate
spread between FRMs and ARMs is just above its four-year low reached
this past July (chart). Surveys of mortgage applications conducted
by both the Mortgage Bankers Association and J.P. Morgan show slight
increases recently in FRM applications as a share of total home loan
applications.
In absolute terms, mortgage application volumes are at
historically high levels. The MBA's home purchase index reached a
record high in the week ended October 20, coinciding with the drop
in mortgage commitment rates. In contrast, both the MBA and J.P.
Morgan surveys report that the volume of refinancing applications

remains significantly below the recent peak reached in mid-July.
Moreover, recent agency prepayment data show declines in prepayment
rates for the month of September, suggesting that the surge in
refinancings witnessed over the past six months will taper off
unless spurred on by a further sizable drop in mortgage contract
rates.
In the secondary market, the large FRM share of mortgage
originations continues to be reflected in increased production of
mortgage-backed securities. Although gross issuance of agency-
backed pass-through securities has moved up steadily from the market

bottom in January, totaling $29.1 billion in September (chart), it
is still substantially below the rate of issuance in 1993.
Despite the increased volume of pass-throughs, the agency
CMO/REMIC market has remained mired at low issuance levels in recent
months, with little sign of a near-term rebound. For the first nine
months of 1995, issuance totaled only $20 billion, compared with
$113 billion for the first nine months of 1994 and $324 billion for
all of 1993. The continued lull in issuance of CMOs/REMICs appears
to be the result of sparse investor demand, a consequence of many
investors' painful experiences in the derivatives markets in the
past couple years. The void created by the dropoff in CMO/REMIC
production appears to have been filled, in part, by asset-backed
securities (ABS), which are experiencing record issuance levels this
year.
Consumer Credit
Growth of outstanding consumer installment credit slowed to a
6-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in September,
following an upward-revised 12-3/4 percent gain in August. For the
third quarter as a whole, growth of consumer installment credit
slowed to a 10 percent annual rate from the 15 percent pace of the
first half. Revolving credit growth in September slipped to a
single-digit pace for the first time since last December, while auto
credit grew at a pace only slightly below that of August. Total
consumer credit (installment plus noninstallment) also moderated a
couple percentage points to a 9 percent growth rate in September.
Various reports over the intermeeting period suggest that
credit performance of consumer loans likely has eroded further in
recent months, albeit from fairly low delinquency levels. Indeed,
most respondents to the November loan officer survey indicated that
their banks' consumer loan delinquencies had increased this year,

which they attributed to several factors, including higher household
debt burdens, greater willingness by households to declare
bankruptcy, and slower growth in some markets. Although on net the
willingness of surveyed banks to make consumer loans had not changed
since August, a number of the respondents noted they had tightened
lending standards and some had increased loan spreads, but these
adjustments generally were small. These survey results are
consistent with anecdotal reports of a growing number of
institutional lenders undertaking reviews of their lending programs
and standards. More broadly, as noted, investor concerns about the
quality of lenders' portfolios contributed to some retrenchment of
bank and other financial institution stock prices recently.
As noted above, securitization of consumer loans has been very
strong so far this year; at $64-1/2 billion through mid-October,
securitizations have already surpassed the record annual level set
in 1994 (table). This rapid growth reflects both the rise in
consumer loans outstanding as well as the hunger of investors for
high-quality assets, evidenced, for example, by the narrowing of
spreads on securities backed by credit-card receivables (chart).
Although growth has occurred in most major asset categories,
credit card-backed securities have provided the biggest boost to
total issuance in 1995, stimulated both by strong growth in
outstanding credit card balances and by the need to re-securitize
assets underlying maturing securitizations. In 1995, about
$14 billion to $18 billion of existing securitizations are scheduled
to be paid down in whole or in part. For banks, there is a need to
"roll" these issues over in order to keep the underlying account
balances from returning to the balance sheet and, thus, having to
hold capital against the loans. For retailers and nonbank issuers

with less than top credit ratings on their debt, securitization
provides a very attractive means of financing credit card programs.
ABS issuance has also been boosted by a sizable increase in
offerings of securities backed by home equity loans. Notable among
the third-quarter home equity issues were two that featured a Fannie
Mae guarantee "wrapped" around the securities. A Fannie Mae "wrap"
broadens the investor base for the securities to include a number of
public entities and other investors whose investments are restricted
to government or federal agency securities. For banks, the Fannie-
backed securities carry a risk weight of 20 percent, compared with
the 50 percent or 100 percent risk weights of traditional home
equity loan securities. To date, Fannie Mae has done three home
equity loan deals, totaling roughly $820 million.

Exports jumped sharply after falling in July, and imports were about
unchanged following a substantial decline in July. For July-August

The level of exports of goods and services for July-August
combined declined about 1/2 percent relative to the second quarter,
as increases in exports of computers and agricultural products were
more than offset by decreases in exports of aircraft, gold, and
service receipts. Most of the changes in exports were due to
quantities. The exceptions were agricultural products, where all of
the increase was in prices, and industrial supplies, where quantity
declines were exactly offset by price increases.
Imports of goods and services for July-August combined were
about 2 percent lower than in the second quarter. Declines were
recorded in most major import categories; notable exceptions were
imported computers and semiconductors, which continued to rise
sharply. Most of the decrease in non-oil imports reflected changes
in quantities, as prices increased relative to the second quarter.

Oil Imports
The total quantity of oil imports is estimated to have risen
in the third quarter due in part to a modest pickup in
stockbuilding. Oil imports dipped in August, however, despite
higher oil consumption. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics
indicate that oil imports likely rebounded in September, as
inventory accumulation resumed.
The price of imported oil rose in September, after falling in
the previous three months. The earlier declines reflected concerns
in world spot markets about an over-abundant world oil supply.
These concerns abated, however, as spot WTI prices rose in August
(reflected in September import prices) and again in September
reflecting very lean U.S. inventories, uncertainty about the impact
of recent hurricanes on Caribbean oil facilities, and increased
tensions with Iraq (the defection of two high level Iraqi government
officials in August and the ensuing U.S. military build-up in the
Gulf Region). In October, however, spot oil prices fell back by
almost $1.00 per barrel, in part because of a partial rebound in oil
production in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, concerns about
continued quota-busting by OPEC producers, and short-lived rumors
about Iraq's acceptance of a limited U.N. oil sale for humanitarian
purposes.
Prices of Merchandise Non-Oil Imports and Exports
The average price of U.S. non-oil imports rose significantly
less in the third quarter than in recent quarters. Most categories
of non-oil imports posted modest price increases; in particular,
prices of non-oil industrial supplies, automotive products, and
capital goods (excluding computers) slowed sharply from previous
periods.

The average price of U.S. exports rose modestly in the third
quarter, also significantly less than in recent quarters. Most of
the increase stemmed from an upswing in the average price of
agricultural products, especially grains. The price of non-
agricultural exports fell in the third quarter, the first quarterly
decline since 1993Q4. The decrease was the result of sharp declines
in the price of exported industrial supplies, following four
consecutive quarters of double-digit increases, and a continued fall
in computer prices.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
(line 4) were extremely large in July and August. The United
Kingdom, Japan, and the Caribbean financial centers accounted for
the bulk of the net purchases. In the first eight months of 1995,
recorded net private purchases by Japanese residents amounted to
almost $36 billion, compared with $14 billion in all of 1994.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate and agency bonds (line
4b) were also strong in July and August. More recent information
indicates that new Eurobond issues by U.S. corporations fell
somewhat in September from the very strong August pace. Foreigners
showed renewed interest in the U.S. stock market in July and August
(line 4c); net purchases in those two months amounted to more than
cumulative net purchases in the previous six months or in all of
1994.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) were also
strong in July and August. More than half of U.S. net purchases of
foreign stocks (line 5b) during these months were from Japan.
Purchases of stocks from other developed countries accounted for the
bulk of the remainder, although there was some net investment in
developing economies in Asia. Similarly, U.S. net purchases of

foreign bonds (line 5a) also were concentrated in the developed
countries. However, U.S. investors did purchase over $1 billion in
bonds from Mexico in July. The issue of $1 billion in two-year
floating rate paper by Mexico in mid-July probably accounted for a
large part of these recorded purchases by U.S. investors.
Foreign official assets in the United States (line 1) rose
strongly in July, but rose by less in August. G-10 holdings (line
la) showed little increase in August despite large reported
intervention purchases of dollars by Japan. Information from FRBNY
shows that heavy intervention in September also was not reflected in
changes in reserve holdings at the FRBNY, as would typically be the
case. Very large increases in U.S. holdings were reported for
"other countries" (line 1c) in July and August, particularly Brazil
and China, but also several other developing countries in Asia and
Latin America.
There was little net change in the foreign positions of
banking offices in the United States between the end of June and the
end of August (line 3). However, monthly average data show net
inflows into banks in the United States from their IBFs and own
foreign offices in the third quarter of 1995. (See line 1 of the
International Banking Data table.) These inflows were concentrated
at Japanese-chartered banks and probably reflected their response to
the premium they were being charged to borrow dollars in interbank
markets.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets
The weighted-average dollar has moved in a narrow range since
the time of the September 26 FOMC meeting, declining about 3/4
percent on balance. The dollar has moved down 1/2 to 2 percent
against most of the major European currencies but has risen nearly
1-1/2 percent against the yen.
Over the intermeeting period, the dollar has depreciated 1-1/2
percent against the mark, as the U.S.-German long-term interest rate
differential moved against the dollar. During the period, the
Bundesbank moved to reduce short-term interest rates in Germany,
although perhaps somewhat less than had been expected, by ratcheting
down its weekly repo rate in small steps a total of 12 basis points.
The German three-month interbank interest rate edged down only 5
basis points during the period. At times during the intermeeting
period, the mark was supported by concerns that some European
countries, most notably France and Italy, would not be able to meet
the Maastricht criteria for European Monetary Union by the deadline
set forth in the treaty.
The dollar has declined about 1-1/2 percent against the
French franc during the intermeeting period, leaving the franc
little changed on balance against the mark. The franc had been
lower during the period as concerns over the budget and political
problems of the Chirac government came to the fore. Subsequent
statements by French officials asserting that they were willing to
take the policy stances needed to meet their budgetary and exchange
rate objectives, along with reports that the Prime Minister would
not be prosecuted for alleged improprieties in arranging family
housing in Paris, seemed to stay the pressure on the franc. In the
interim, however, French authorities suspended the 5-to-10-day
emergency lending facility and reintroduced a 24-hour emergency

lending facility at rates as high as 7.25 percent, 110 basis points
above the previous 5-to-10-day rate. Later in the period, as the
pressure on the franc subsided, the authorities moved the rate down
25 basis points to 7 percent.
The lira has declined nearly 1-1/2 percent on balance against
the mark during the period, and short- and long-term interest rates
in Italy moved up on net more than 10 basis points. The lira had
declined more and interest rates had risen further, as prospects for
the Dini government sank sharply ahead of a no-confidence vote on
October 26. The later recovery of asset prices in Italy followed
the dramatic, last-minute defeat of the no-confidence motion.
The yen weakened during the intermeeting period, as concerns
over the financial problems of Japanese banks appeared at times to
weigh on the currency, although the news in early November of the
termination of Daiwa Bank operations in the United States did not
seem to have created any further pressures on the yen or on the
funding costs of Japanese banks. Somewhat surprisingly, the
bellwether bond yield in Japan rose nearly 15 basis points during
the period, despite widespread declines in long-term bond yields
outside Japan and evidence of some flight-to-quality in the yields
on Japanese government securities at the short end of the maturity
spectrum. Reflecting part of the increase in the premium Japanese
banks paid to raise funds during the period, the three-month CD rate
in Japan edged up 6 basis points,
In recent months, a "Japan premium" has developed in both
dollar and yen interbank markets. Japanese banks have paid a
premium to borrow dollars in the interbank market since late July.
During late October, the premium for three-month dollar deposits
peaked at 50-70 basis points over rates paid by the most
creditworthy banks; it has since declined to 30-40 basis points.
Market commentary attributes the premium to Japanese banks' securing

IV-13
funds over the year-end book closing well in advance, to avoid
liquidity shortfalls. While Japanese banks have paid a premium for
year-end funds in past years, this year's premium is larger and more
persistent.
The maturity pattern of the premium confirms the importance of
both a year-end and a more prolonged effect. The premium shows up
most strongly at the three- and six-month maturities; for overnight
and one-week deposits, there is a negligible premium, while one-
month deposits carry a smaller premium. The combination of a
smaller one-month premium and a roughly equal premium at three and
six months implies a spike in the future one-month premium between
one and three months out followed by a sustained positive premium
between three and six months out.
The emergence of the premium appears to be having effects in
other financial markets. The dollar/yen forward rate has been
depressed as Japanese banks, faced with higher funding costs in
dollars, buy dollars in the spot market and sell them forward, after
the year-end. U.S. variable-rate municipal bonds issued with
guarantees from Japanese banks are paying 0.2 percent more than
bonds guaranteed by non-Japanese banks.
In recent weeks a premium has developed in yen funding markets
as well. As of November 7, Japanese banks appear to be paying
nearly 20 basis points more for one-month funding in the yen deposit
market than non-Japanese banks and 25-30 basis points more for
three-month funding in yen. An alternative measure of the credit
risk assigned to Japanese banks, the spread between the three-month
yen CD rate and the Japanese government treasury bill of comparable
maturity, has widened from 10 basis points or less in early
September to about 35 basis points on November 7.
The Canadian dollar has declined less than 1 percent on
balance against the U.S. dollar, after having traded in a wide range

IV-14
over the intermeeting period as expectations for the defeat of the
Quebec sovereignty referendum waxed and waned. In the days
immediately preceding the October 30 referendum, poll results
showing the separatists moving ahead by a small margin prompted a
decline of roughly 2 percent in the Canadian dollar. That drop was
reversed immediately following the referendum, in which Quebec
narrowly rejected the sovereignty proposal. The Canadian three-
month interest rate moved synchronously with the exchange rate
during the period, rising about 85 basis points in the days before
the referendum and declining that amount and more immediately
following the referendum. The extra decline in the three-month rate
validated an immediate 25 basis point cut in the Bank of Canada's
target range for the overnight rate and registered expectations of a
further cut in the near term.
The Mexican peso has declined nearly 20 percent since the
September FOMC meeting. Market commentary has focused on the lack
of any clear indications of recovery in Mexican economic activity in
the wake of the very sharp drop in second-quarter GDP announced in
August, and investors may be concerned about the government's
willingness to sustain its restrictive monetary policy stance.
Mexican monetary authorities have so far responded to the recent
pressure on the peso by refraining from exchange market intervention
and maintaining unchanged bank reserve positions, allowing market
interest rates to rise. The one-month interest rate in Mexico has
risen roughly 20 percentage points during the intermeeting period,
moving up to near the 55 percent level. Stock prices have continued
to decline, with the major equity index declining another 6-1/2
percent during the intermeeting period.
The Swedish krona has risen more than 4 percent against the
dollar, and Swedish short-term and long-term interest rates are down
about 25-40 basis points from their levels at the time of the

IV-15
September FOMC meeting, bolstered in part by better-than-expected
inflation data.
The Desk did not intervene
for the U.S. monetary authorities during the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic growth remains subdued in the major foreign
industrial countries. The Japanese economy has still shown little
evidence of a sustained recovery, while growth in the European
economies, with the exception of Italy, has continued to slow.
However, the Canadian economy appears to have resumed a modest
upward trend after contracting sharply earlier in the year.
Inflation abroad remains relatively low on average. Prices
have continued to fall on a year-over-year basis at both the
consumer and producer level in Japan, while consumer price inflation
has declined further in Canada. In Europe, underlying inflation has
been fairly stable in most countries, although the August increase
in the French VAT as well as drought and currency depreciation in
the United Kingdom have put some upward pressure on prices in recent
months in those countries.
Major economic and financial uncertainties exist in a number
of these countries. In Japan, concerns about the health of the
banking sector persist and banks are paying a funding premium. In
Europe, increased uncertainty about the ability of France to qualify
for EMU on schedule as well as political turbulence in Italy have
tended to put upward pressure on interest rates in those countries.
Although last week's sovereignty referendum was defeated in Canada,
the narrow margin suggests that the issue has not yet been resolved.

IV-16
Individual country notes. In Japan, recent indicators suggest
that private-sector activity remains weak, although some tentative
signs of improvement have begun to appear. Industrial production
fell in the third quarter after a flat second quarter, and the
unemployment rate remained at a record level of 3.2 percent.
However, machinery orders were a little higher on average in July
and August than in the second quarter. Also, housing starts rose
sharply in September from their very depressed August level,
although they were still down for the third quarter on average.
After registering a sizable decline in the second quarter, new car
registrations--an important indicator of durable consumption--
regained most of the lost ground in the third quarter. Meanwhile,
prices have continued to fall. The October CPI for the Tokyo area
was 0.8 percent below year-earlier levels, while wholesale prices
were down 0.2 percent in September on the same basis.

The Japanese current account surplus has continued to decline,
registering $119 billion (SAAR) in the year through September, down

IV-17
about $13 billion from the same period last year. In the year
through September, the merchandise trade surplus (SAAR) was $114
billion, down about $8 billion from a year earlier.
In Germany, available data suggest that real activity has
moderated somewhat from the 2-1/2 percent (SAAR) pace registered in
the first half of this year. Virtually all indicators--including
production, employment, prices, exports, and surveys of business and
consumer confidence--point to sluggish growth. However, there is
some uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of incoming evidence
such as production, orders, and retail sales, given the redefinition
of these series at the beginning of the year to achieve compliance
with EU standards. Consumer price inflation has remained subdued,
with the year-over-year rate just above 1-1/2 percent through
October.

The Bundesbank's targeted monetary aggregate M3 picked up in
September, registering 1.5 percent growth (SAAR) relative to its
base in the fourth quarter of last year. Although M3 growth will

IV-18
most likely not reach the targeted range of 4 to 6 percent this
year, the September pick-up was substantial, with the level of M3
balances more than 3/4 of one percentage point above its August
value.
The Kohl government has announced a downward revision to
expected tax revenue for this year and next. The revision is due
mostly to subsidies in eastern Germany and refunds for earlier tax
years and to a lesser extent to weaker-than-expected activity. In
response to this shortfall in tax revenue. Finance Minister Waigel
is requiring special approval for all federal government
expenditures in excess of DM 1 million through the end of 1995 (the
threshold rises to DM 10 million in 1996).
In France, monthly indicators suggest that economic activity
slowed further in the third quarter and remains sluggish. The
July/August level of industrial production (SA) was only slightly
above that registered in the second quarter, while the unemployment
rate was unchanged in August and up slightly in September. On the
demand side, third-quarter spending on manufactured goods (equal to
one-third of total consumption) was down sharply from its second-
quarter level, although the drop in consumption was probably partly
attributable to a two-percentage point increase in the VAT on
August 1.
The business confidence survey by INSEE, the French
statistical institute, indicates that business output declined
sharply in September and fell slightly further in October. However,
the survey also revealed that firms expect to increase output by the
end of this year.
The August increase in the VAT has also resulted in a rise in
the rate of year-over-year consumer price inflation in August and
September to about 2 percent from 1-1/2 percent in July. However,

IV-19
inflation exclusive of the VAT increase appears to have remained
stable.

The French trade performance has improved significantly this
year relative to last year. The trade surplus continued to rise in
August, and for the eight months through August was about $9 billion

Recent data for the United Kingdom suggest that economic
growth continued to slow in the third quarter, as real GDP rose a
preliminary 2.0 percent (SAAR), slightly less than in the second
quarter. Industrial production rose moderately in the third
quarter, with most of the increase in the gas and oil extraction
sector. On the demand side, retail sales were unchanged on balance
in the third quarter. Forward-looking survey indicators are
consistent with a softening trend. For example, the balance of
firms expecting to increase output fell from +15 in July to +10 in
October, according to the quarterly CBI survey. However, the

IV-20
unemployment rate fell gradually throughout the third quarter to 8.1
percent in September.

Inflation increased in the third quarter after remaining quite
stable over the previous half-year. Targeted inflation, measured as
the 12-month change in retail prices excluding mortgage interest
payments, rose to 3.1 percent in September from 2.8 percent in July.
The producer price index also continued to rise rapidly in the third
quarter. The recent increase in consumer price inflation largely
reflects upward pressure from both the pound's depreciation since
the end of last year and this summer's drought, while growth in
average earnings has slowed somewhat.
In Italy, real GDP declined a small amount in the second
quarter (SAAR) following strong growth in the first quarter.
However, the drop in GDP was concentrated in inventory investment,
as final domestic demand and exports continued to grow rapidly.
Investment growth was especially strong, while consumption showed a
modest increase and government expenditures declined. Net exports

IV-21
made a positive contribution to growth as exports continued to grow
at a rapid pace. These data should be regarded as preliminary and
are likely to be revised substantially, as has occurred in the past.

Inflation in Italy appears to have stabilized, but remains
high. The year-over-year change in the consumer price index
remained at 5.8 percent in October, the same rate as in the two
previous months. Wholesale price inflation in August was down a
little from the July level. However, wage inflation in September
stood at 4.0 percent on a year-over-year basis, up from 3.2 percent
in August.
On October 3, Prime Minister Dini presented the 1996 budget to
parliament. The budget, which by law must be approved by the end of
the year, includes a $20 billion deficit reduction package and calls
for savings through a combination of tax rises and reductions in
public expenditure. The 1996 budget deficit is projected to be 5.8
percent of GDP, down from an estimated 7.4 percent in 1995.
On October 26, Dini pledged to resign by the end of the year
following the passage of the 1996 budget. His announcement came
immediately before the government survived a vote of no-confidence
instigated by Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of the center-right
coalition. Berlusconi presented the no-confidence motion to
parliament after the Senate passed a center-left initiated motion
to oust Justice Minister Filippo Mancuso. National elections are
now likely to be held before the end of March.
Indicators of economic activity in Canada suggest that growth
resumed at a moderate pace in the third quarter after a sharp
contraction in the second quarter. Both industrial production and
retail sales were slightly above the second-quarter average in July
and August, while employment rose in August after showing little
change over the preceding half year, and increased further in
September and October. As a result, the unemployment rate was 9.4
percent in October, a little below the third-quarter average.
However, consumer and business confidence have remained weak.

IV-23
Although the index of consumer attitudes registered a slight
increase in the third quarter, it remained below 1994 levels.
Business confidence slipped in the third quarter, primarily
reflecting concerns over inventory buildup and excess capacity.
Consumer price inflation has dropped back after a pickup in the
second quarter, and was around 2-1/4 percent in both August and
September.

On October 30, Quebec voters rejected the sovereignty
referendum by a very narrow margin. Prime Minister Chretien has
called for reconciliation with Quebec and a promise to bring about
constitutional changes necessary to recognize the distinct character
of Quebec society. However, separatist leaders have suggested
another bid for independence should not be ruled out.-~--

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in Mexico and Argentina appears to have
remained weak in the third quarter following second-quarter declines
in real GDP, while the slowdown in growth in Brazil that began in
the second quarter probably continued into the third quarter.
Growth remained strong in the major Asian developing countries,
although the pace has moderated recently in China. In Russia,
economic activity appears to have stabilized.
The contraction in economic activity in Mexico and Argentina,
along with strong export growth, has contributed to the turnaround
in these countries' trade balances. In Brazil, the trade balance
moved into modest surplus in recent months after previously
registering large deficits. However, in Venezuela, import growth
was high and trade deficits have remained sizable. Both exports and
imports grew rapidly in the Asian developing countries, while
movements in trade balances have been mixed.
Inflation in Argentina and Brazil has continued to decline,
but progress toward reducing inflation in Mexico and Venezuela
appears to have slowed in recent months. Inflation in the Asian
countries and in Russia continues to slow.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, monthly indicators
suggest that economic activity remained depressed in the third
quarter after contracting sharply in the second quarter. Industrial
production was down about 12 percent from its year-earlier level in
July, the same as the June decline, while the unemployment rate
climbed to 7.5 percent by September. Inflation, after declining
steadily from its April peak of 8 percent at a monthly rate, ticked
up slightly to 2.1 percent in September, raising concerns that
progress toward reducing inflation in the wake of last December's

IV-28
devaluation of the peso may be slowing. Consumer prices increased
by 1.1 percent during the first half of October.
In part reflecting the continued weakness of the economy,
Mexico's trade performance remains strong. Over the first nine
months of 1995, exports were 33 percent above their year-earlier
level, while imports were down almost 8 percent. As a result, the
trade surplus for the January-September period registered $5.4
billion compared with a $13.6 billion deficit for the same period in
1994.

On October 29, representatives of government (including the
Bank of Mexico), business, and labor in Mexico agreed on a new
economic pact for 1996. The agreement seeks to achieve economic
growth of at least three percent while keeping inflation to 20
percent. Unlike the pacts concluded in previous years, which
stipulated the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate band, the
current pact provides for a continuation of the floating exchange
rate regime in the coming year. The agreement calls for a balanced
budget in 1996--a slight decline from the 0.5 percent of GDP surplus
targeted for 1995--with increases in investment spending and
reductions in certain business taxes being offset by reductions in

IV-29
current expenditures. As with previous pacts, the current agreement
specifies increases in the minimum wage--10 percent increases in
December 1995 and April 1996--and in public sector energy prices--a
rise of 29 percent from December 1995 through the end of 1996.
In Argentina, consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in October from
a year earlier. Real GDP fell 3.7 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, and industrial production continued to decline
in the third quarter. The drop in economic activity, in conjunction
with a consumption boom in Brazil, contributed to a rapid turnaround
in Argentina's trade deficit. In the first eight months of 1995,
exports rose by 40 percent over a year earlier, while imports
declined by 9.1 percent. However, the trade surplus peaked in June,
and Brazil's recent slowdown suggests it will contribute
significantly less to Argentina's export growth in the remainder of
the year.

Increased uncertainty about Finance Minister Cavallo's future,
the prospects of the Convertibility Law, and the weakness of the
Mexican peso led to a fall of 9.3 percent in the Buenos Aires stock
market between October 18 and October 26. As of November 3, the
stock market had recovered about 5 percent. Gross international

IV-30
reserves fell from $14.7 billion at end-September to $13.3 billion
at end-October, of which $0.7 billion are dollar-denominated Bonex
bonds. The decline in reserves is partly due to a $1 billion
buyback of domestic dollar-denominated bonds, reflecting the
government's efforts to improve banking system liquidity. The
monetary base was $11.4 billion at end-October, leaving $1.9 billion
in excess international reserves.
In Brazil, indications are that economic activity has
continued the slowdown that began in the second quarter. Monthly
inflation has fallen further under the stabilization program,
although seasonal effects were apparently responsible for some of
the decline.

Brazil recorded modest trade surpluses during August and
September, after sizeable trade deficits during the first half of
the year. International reserves (liquidity concept) continued to
climb, reaching $49 billion at the end of September, compared with
$34 billion in March 1995.
In September and October, the Central Bank reduced the
overnight interest rate several times in response to the weakening
of the economy. Since late August, the overnight rate has fallen
from 57 to 44 percent.

IV-31
In Venezuela, 12-month consumer price inflation was 51 percent
in October, essentially unchanged from September. Real GDP grew 1.1
percent during the first half from a year earlier, largely due to
7.7 percent growth in the state-owned oil sector; the private
sector, however, contracted by 2.6 percent during the first half.
Venezuela registered a trade deficit of $3.2 billion for the first
seven months of 1995, up from a deficit of $2.4 billion during the
same period in 1994, reflecting a 26 percent increase in imports and
an 18 percent increase in exports.

Venezuela began talks with the IMF in late September towards a
stand-by arrangement that is expected to be approved in early 1996.
Since the IMF program is likely to call for a devaluation of the
exchange rate, the bolivar has been under strong downward pressure.
The central bank's efforts to defend the exchange rate caused
international reserves excluding gold to fall to $5.8 billion at the
end of September from $7 billion at the end of June. To stem a
further drop in foreign reserves, the government created a committee
in mid-October to oversee foreign currency import requests and
stagger the disbursal of dollars. On October 25, Venezuela
introduced a dual exchange rate system. The new exchange rate for
travelers and credit card expenses is now determined by the implicit
exchange rate set by Brady bond prices on the Caracas Stock
Exchange, currently about 286 bolivars per dollar, while all other

IV-32
transactions will take place at the official exchange rate of 170
bolivars per dollar.
In China, real GDP growth and inflation continued to slow in
the third quarter. Real GDP rose 9.8 percent in the first three
quarters of 1995 from the year earlier period, somewhat below its
1994 pace. Consumer price inflation registered 14.4 percent in the
twelve months ending in September, continuing its steady decline
from its peak of 28 percent in October 1994.
China ran a trade surplus of $16.4 billion in the first three
quarters of 1994, well above its surplus of $1.2 billion in the same
period a year ago. The value of exports rose 35 percent over this
period, while the value of imports rose 16 percent. At the end of
September 1995, China's total reserves less gold reached $71
billion, up $19 billion from the end of 1994.

quarter, while consumer price inflation declined. The trade surplus
in the first three quarters of 1995 declined somewhat from its year-
earlier level, as the value of exports rose 23 percent while imports
rose 26 percent. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which peaked
at $100 billion in June 1995, fell to $91 billion at the end of

In Korea, economic activity continued to expand at a robust
pace during the third quarter, as the recent cyclical upturn entered
its third year. Despite rapid growth, inflation remained low by
historical standards: consumer prices in October were 4.4 percent
higher than their year-earlier level. Monetary policy appears to
have become somewhat more accommodating during the past two months,
as the central bank has allowed most of the runup in short-term
interest rates that occurred last fall and in the early part of this
year to be reversed.
Merchandise exports rose by 33 percent during the first three
quarters of this year from their year-earlier level. Imports also
expanded by 33 percent, largely due to a strong expansion of
business investment. Because imports began from a higher base, this
contributed to a substantial deterioration of Korea's current
account balance over that period.

In Russia, monthly consumer price inflation in September and
October remained at 5 percent, and the ruble-dollar exchange rate
continued to fluctuate around 4500. Real GDP and industrial
production during the third quarter were essentially unchanged from
their year-earlier levels, following four years of sharp declines.
The Central Bank reduced its benchmark refinance rate from 15
percent to 14.2 percent a month in late October.
Russia has successfully completed six monthly reviews under
its IMF stand-by arrangement. Through September, the government
satisfied all of the program's quantitative indicative monthly
targets. Notably, the fiscal deficit for the first nine months was
held to 3 percent of GDP, well below the requirements of the IMF
program. The government, however, is facing increased political
pressure to ease economic policies, as mid-December's parliamentary
elections approach. In an effort to obtain additional fiscal
financing, the government has recently taken steps to reinvigorate
its cash-based privatization program.
On November 8, President Yeltsin removed Mrs. Paramonova as
Acting Central Bank Chairman. Alexander Khandruyev, one of her
deputies, will serve as Acting Chairman until Yeltsin chooses a
permanent candidate. Russian financial markets were calm
immediately following the announcement.
