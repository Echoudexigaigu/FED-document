The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Revised data suggest that growth of real GDP in the third
quarter may have been even faster than the BEA initially estimated,
and labor input in October and November appears to have expanded at
a pace sufficient to support at least a moderate advance of real
output in the fourth quarter However, data on expenditures have
been somewhat less robust, on the whole, than the labor market
indicators. The trends in wage and price inflation appear to be
holding steady
Third-quarter GDP
Source data that have become available since the BEA's advance
estimate of real GDP was prepared in late October suggest that
growth may have been considerably stronger than initially indicated.
Data that were missing in late October have come in on the high side
of assumptions that BEA had incorporated into the advance estimate,
and revisions to data that already were in hand have tended to run
in a positive direction.

annual rate. As can be seen in the table, inventory accumulation
likely was greater than the BEA initially estimated, but most
categories of final sales apparently were stronger as well. In
terms of 1994 dollars, third-quarter growth of real GDP probably was
about 4-1/2 percent, by our rough estimate. The BEA's upcoming
revisions will start to feature a "chain-type" GDP index with a
"Laspeyres tail" that uses 1994 prices to measure recent changes in
real output. Revised data in terms of 1987 dollars will not be
reported.
Labor Market Developments
The BLS reported that nonfarm payroll employment rose 166,000
in November after a gain of 66,000 in October. However,
interpretation of these data has been complicated by the agency's
semiannual updating of seasonal factors, which, according to BLS
convention, resulted in new factors being applied to the November
level of payroll employment but left previous months' levels of
payroll employment in terms of old seasonals. Had consistent
seasonals been applied to the data, last month's rise in payroll
employment would have been 44,000 smaller than the published figure,
but the October gain would have been 42,000 larger. An additional
complication is that the November survey date was late this year, so
that more of the usual seasonal hiring was picked up in November,
rather than December. The BLS estimated that the net effect of the
late survey week was to add 25,000 to the November change in total
payrolls.1
1. The BLS said in its November employment release that the
federal shutdown from November 14 to November 19 had no effect on
data from the establishment survey. Schedules for collecting data
in the household survey were disrupted to some extent, but the BLS
said that sufficient interviews were conducted to provide an
adequate sample and that the quality of the data did not appear to
be "materially compromised" by the later-than-scheduled interviews.

II-4
According to the published figures, aggregate hours of
production or nonsupervisory workers fell 0.4 percent in November
after a cumulative gain of 1.1 percent over the two previous months.
The average workweek was little affected by the revisions to
seasonal factors, and that information, together with the data on
payroll employment, points to a fourth-quarter rise in aggregate
hours of roughly 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate, an advance
sufficient to yield a sizable increase in real GDP if a moderate
productivity gain is achieved this quarter. A similar message is
conveyed by recent changes in the unemployment rate. Although the
jobless rate edged back up to 5.6 percent in November, its average
for October and November, using concurrent seasonal factors, was
5.5 percent, a little below the average for the third quarter.
The November detail on payroll employment showed job growth
concentrated, once again, in the private service-producing sector.
In retail trade, two-thirds of a sizable monthly rise in the
published numbers stemmed from the updating of seasonal factors and
the late survey. Other broad categories within the private service-
producing sector were less affected by these influences.

Note. The two special factors are the updating of seasonals and

In the goods-producing sector, employment in construction was
little changed in November. In manufacturing, employment fell
26,000 after adjustment for the effects of the aforementioned
special factors. The published detail for manufacturing showed
further increases in employment in the capital goods sectors.
However, temporary layoffs cut into the payrolls of auto
manufacturers, and small declines were reported in most other
industries. The average workweek for all manufacturing was
unchanged in November after having declined in October.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance were pushed up
temporarily by the federal shutdown in mid-November. About 31,000
filings by furloughed federal workers were picked up in data for the
week ended November 18, an additional 21,000 were taken up the
following week, and 15,000 were reported in the first week of
December.2 Claims filed under state programs, which exclude
federal workers, fluctuated relatively narrowly before dropping off
in the week ended December 9.

workers. Other states initially held up the claims but processed
them later. In addition, some workers filed claims at their
respective agencies, which were slow to forward the applications to
the states.

has been moving sideways since the middle of 1994. The Manpower
series of net hiring for the first quarter of 1996 was unchanged at
16 percentage points. Like the help wanted index, this series has
traced out a relatively flat trend over the past year and a
half.
The published data on average hourly earnings show large
increases in September and October and a small decline in November,
but the application of consistent seasonals smooths out these ups
and downs. Twelve-month changes in average hourly earnings have
been trending up since 1992, and anecdotal reports of wage pressures
seem to have become a little more numerous of late, both for skilled
workers and entry-level workers. Fourth-quarter data from the
employment cost index, which we consider to be the most reliable
indicator of changes in the "price" of labor, will not be available
until late January. The last ECI showed subdued rates of increase
in hourly compensation persisting through the third quarter.
Two work stoppages that have been prominent in the labor market
news of recent weeks have now ended, with dramatically different
outcomes. On December 4, the United Auto Workers called off their
long-running strike against Caterpillar, and the striking workers
are returning to their jobs without a contract after having rejected
the company's last offer. During the year and a half that the
workers were on strike. Caterpillar maintained production with
temporary replacement workers and UAW members who crossed the picket
line. At Boeing, striking workers voted down a tentative agreement
in mid-November, but a second agreement was ratified in a vote taken
yesterday. The workers, who have been out on strike since
October 6, are starting back to work today. The contract that they

ratified contains provisions for large lump-sum payments in the
first and second years of a four-year contact and moderate increases
in wage rates in the third and fourth years. Workers also obtained
concessions from the company on contract provisions related to job
security and subcontracting. With business starting to pick up, the
company appears to have been eager to settle.
More generally, workers still appear reluctant to press their
wage demands to the point of walking off the job. Through November,
only twenty-five major strikes (those involving 1,000 workers or
more) had occurred this year, and the total for the year as a whole
is likely to fall short of last year's total of forty-five. In the
1970s, the annual number of work stoppages usually was in the
hundreds, but the frequency of strikes fell sharply in the first
half of the 1980s and has since remained low.
Industrial Production
Industrial production fell 0.3 percent in October but edged up
0.2 percent in November. The direct effect of the strike at Boeing
accounted for about two-thirds of the October decline and had a
slight further depressing effect on production in November.
Production of motor vehicles and parts fell 2.4 percent in October
but moved up 0.6 percent in November. Manufacturers assembled motor

vehicles at an estimated rate of 11.7 million units last month,
somewhat below planned output at the beginning of the month.
Outside the motor vehicle and aircraft industries,
manufacturing activity moved up 0.2 percent last month, the same as
the increase in the previous month. Growth in information-related
products--a category that makes up 9-1/2 percent of IP and includes
computers, semiconductors, communications equipment, and selected
instruments--continued to be the primary area of strength in
manufacturing. In addition, the production of industrial equipment
posted a solid gain. Spurred by gains in these categories, business
equipment output rose 0.8 percent in November. A jump in the
production of appliances provided a considerable boost to the output
of consumer durables last month. By contrast, output of consumer
nondurables continued to be sluggish. Production of construction
supplies dropped 0.5 percent in November, a second month of decline
after four strong months; nonetheless, the November index remained
above its third-quarter average. Outside manufacturing, utilities
output was boosted in November by cold weather, and mining
production remained flat.
Utilization rates for the past two years have been revised down
a little in conjunction with annual revisions to the data on
production and capacity. The revisions left the October level of
manufacturing production much the same as previously estimated.
Annual growth in manufacturing capacity was revised up
1/2 percentage point in 1994, and much as before, capacity growth
accelerated sharply in 1994 and 1995. The upward revision in 1994
was concentrated in advanced-processing industries, notably for
motor vehicles and parts and office and computing equipment. Survey
results suggest that operating rates in the computer industry were
much lower than those previously estimated and, given the revised

II-12
estimates for production, imply that capacity growth was much
higher. Among primary-processing industries, operating rates were
altered little, on balance, in 1994 and 1995; upward revisions to
primary metals and to petroleum products offset downward revisions
in other categories. In November, the factory operating rate inched
down 0.1 percentage point from its revised October level, to
82.2 percent, as capacity growth outpaced the small rise in
manufacturing output.
Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity are
somewhat varied. Current schedules of motor vehicle production call
for an increase in assemblies in December and a more noticeable
pickup in the first months of 1996. In recent years, however,
initial first-quarter announcements have tended to be trimmed, and a
similar outcome appears likely early next year, given that the days'
supplies for automobiles and light trucks are above the ranges that
the industry considers comfortable. All told, other indicators
appear consistent with small production increases for manufacturing
excluding motor vehicles. Real new orders for adjusted durable
goods posted a third monthly increase in October. The purchasing
managers' index of new orders--the part of the purchasing managers'
report that we find most useful in forecasting manufacturing
output--ticked up in November, a slight improvement from the October
reading. Measures of industrial commodity prices, discussed in more
detail in the section on prices, have been mixed in recent weeks
after having declined earlier in the fall.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending firmed in November. Total nominal retail
sales increased 0.8 percent last month after a decline of
0.4 percent in October. Spending in the retail control category,

supply stores, also rose 0.8 percent last month, more than retracing
its 0.6 percent October decline. Within the retail control,
spending at durable goods stores recorded a strong gain, consistent
with reports of continued robust demand for home electronics.
Outlays at nondurable goods stores posted a solid 0.6 percent gain
in November, but this rise merely offset a decline of similar size
in October. The monthly swing was especially sharp at apparel
stores. The retail sales data, together with the available
information about prices, suggest that the November level of real
consumer spending on goods other than motor vehicles was 1.0 percent
above its third-quarter average, not at an annual rate.
Sales of light vehicles in November amounted to 14.8 million
units at an annual rate, up considerably from the weak October
reading and about the same as the average pace for the first three
quarters of this year The November increase represented a sharp
gain in sales of light trucks, while unit sales of autos were little
changed. At the Big Three, auto sales slipped a bit, and
confidential reports from GM and Ford indicate that retail demand
remained soft while sales to fleets edged off only a little from the
high levels of the past several months. Dealers' inventories of
cars and light trucks remained at high levels at the end of
November Thus, the industry still is in the difficult position of
having to find a way to work off excess stocks through some
combination of concessionary pricing and production restraint
Producers have said that they plan to maintain the current incentive
plans into early 1996, but how consumers will react to this
information is uncertain: Some potential buyers may choose to take
advantage of the current incentives, but others, mindful of the
industry's behavior in past situations when stocks were sizable, may
choose to hold off in hopes that the deals will get sweeter

II-16
At this point, evidence on consumer spending in December
consists of anecdotal reports and various statistical indicators
from private sources. The anecdotal reports generally indicate that
electronic goods are moving well, but apparel sales are said to be
soft. Most of the statistical indicators, such as the Johnson
Redbook, suggest that retail sales were rather weak in the first ten
days of December. However, it should be noted that these indicators
have not proved to be very reliable in the past, probably in part
because they tend to focus only on certain types of stores or
categories of merchandise.
The BEA has not published any fourth-quarter data on
expenditures for consumer services or personal income. However,
some parts of the picture can be pieced together. Spending on
energy services, which tends to vary predictably with weather
changes, probably was boosted in November by the unusually cold
temperatures in that month. But unless temperatures remain quite
cold for the rest of December, average fourth-quarter spending for
energy will likely fall short of the third-quarter average, which
was elevated by unusually hot weather and a related surge in
electricity consumption.
With regard to income, the BLS data on aggregate hours and
average hourly earnings in October and November would seem to point
toward an appreciable gain in nominal wages and salaries this
quarter. In addition, accounting data that we obtain from the
Department of Agriculture show a sizable jump in farm subsidies in
October.5 Growth of interest income probably has been moderate.
4. The next monthly report on personal income and consumption
currently is scheduled for release on December 21. Complete monthly
detail will not be available until January.
5. In the past, the BEA has not been adjusting farm subsidy
payments for seasonal variation. If that accounting convention were
maintained, farm income probably would show a monthly rise of about
$20 billion at an annual rate in October. However, the upcoming
(Footnote continues on next page)

II-17
All told, these indicators of nominal income growth, together with
the data on consumer prices, seem to point to a healthy gain in real
disposable income this quarter. We suspect that the saving rate may
have ticked up a bit from its third-quarter average.
The recent indicators of consumer sentiment have generally been
on the positive side. The Michigan SRC index of consumer sentiment
rose slightly in early December, reflecting more upbeat expectations
of personal financial and business conditions. Other components of
the overall index and the separate index of unemployment
expectations were little changed. Although the overall Michigan
index is now a few points below its strong readings in the summer,
it remains in a range that historically has coincided with solid
gains in consumer spending. The most recent Conference Board report
pointed to greater consumer optimism than the Michigan survey; the
November value of this index of consumer confidence was at the upper
end of the favorable readings seen over the past year.
Finally, although a growing debt-service burden conceivably is
exerting a negative force on consumer spending, the surge in stock
market wealth probably is providing an offsetting positive force in
the aggregate. The most recent balance sheet data indicate that
household liabilities climbed further in the third quarter, raising
debt service payments. At the same time, however, the run-up in
stock prices increased household assets by a much larger amount.
Consequently, the ratio of household net worth to disposable
personal income has risen substantially.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
NIPA revision will bring a change in these accounting procedures
that should smooth some of the monthly volatility in payments to
farmers.

Housing Markets
After a strong third quarter, most indicators of housing market
activity either flattened or turned down early in the current
quarter. In the single-family sector, production and demand both
eased in October. Starts of single-family homes fell 2 percent, but
permit issuance suggests that the true level of starts may have been
a shade higher than the reported figures. Nonetheless, some easing
of construction appears to have been warranted, given the most
recent indicators of housing demand. New home sales declined about
3 percent in October from a downward-revised estimate for September.
Existing home sales also backed down in October, but they remained
near their most recent highs.
Indicators for the period since October present a mixed picture
of change in single-family housing demand. Market assessments by
home builders turned down in November after improving through most
of the year. In contrast, applications for home purchase loans
remained at a high level in recent weeks and would seem to imply
more sales and starts than observed in October. Consumer attitudes
toward home buying bounced back early this month after having
slipped since midyear. The sector continues to be supported by
favorable mortgage financing conditions, which have made new single-
family housing as affordable as at any time in the past quarter
century.
The multifamily sector has been soft since early this year,
although probably not so weak as implied by October's reduced level
of starts. Permit issuance for these projects exceeded starts by an
unusually wide margin in September and October. Both the permit
data and market fundamentals, including demographics and the
availability of finance for construction, suggest some near-term
rebound in multifamily starts.

Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment continues to be an area of strength
in the economy, but its growth apparently has slowed from the
extraordinary pace that was evident in 1994 and early 1995. Recent
gains in investment have also been less widespread than those of a
year ago, when large increases in spending were evident across
nearly all major categories.
From all appearances, falling computer prices and the desire of
businesses to stay current with changing technologies are still
providing powerful impetus for investment in computers. After steep
increases in August and September, the nominal shipments of office
and computing equipment held at a high level in October, roughly
5 percent above the average for the third quarter. Moreover, our
industry contacts provided extremely bullish reports about computer
deliveries in November and December.
By contrast, investment in equipment other than computers
appears to be slowing. Although shipments of nondefense capital
goods other than computers were at a high level in October, the
trends in new orders and unfilled orders for these goods have
flattened. Reports from our industry contacts have become less
upbeat of late, consistent with the deceleration evident in the
incoming data. Technological imperatives for new investment in
these types of goods are not so strong as for computers, and
cyclical influences, working through the accelerator and business
cash flow, are providing dwindling positive stimulus.
Recent indicators of business investment in transportation
equipment have been mixed. Outlays for light vehicles have been
supported this quarter by a high level of sales to daily rental
companies. Sales of heavy trucks turned up in October and
November. Shipments of heavy trucks could be propped up temporarily

if buyers take delivery on orders they have already placed.
However, net new orders have been very low in recent months, and
comments from the industry are decidedly negative. Historically,
outlays for heavy trucks have been highly cyclical, going through
booms and busts larger in percentage terms than the cyclical swings
in either total BFI or total equipment purchases.
Elsewhere in transportation, shipments of complete aircraft
dropped 41 percent in October, in part reflecting the Boeing strike.
Boeing's announced shipments of complete aircraft in November were
low, and a major negative effect on fourth-quarter outlays now seems
unavoidable. Looking ahead, Boeing announced a substantial new
order from Singapore Airlines for thirty-four 777s with options for
forty-three more. This order marks a significant victory for
Boeing, as Airbus aggressively pushed its A330 in competing bids.
This new order for 777s, combined with the other recent new orders
received by both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, suggests that the
long decline in domestic aircraft production may be bottoming out.
Outlays for nonresidential structures advanced strongly over
the first three quarters of the year, and the most recent
construction data are consistent with a continuation of this trend.
Construction put in place in October was well above the third-
quarter average. After a weak third quarter, industrial
construction appears to be rebounding. Other commercial
construction, which includes retail outlets, was also at a high
level in October relative to the third quarter, despite anecdotal
reports of overbuilding in the retail area. Construction of office
and institutional buildings has been about flat. Leading indicators
of future construction have been solid. A month or so ago, permits
for nonresidential construction appeared to be dropping off their
uptrend, but the sharp advance in October recovered most of the lost

ground. Other indicators of the general health of the
nonresidential sector are also quite positive. Prices of existing
properties are increasing moderately, and vacancy rates have been
declining steadily.
Drilling and mining activity has continued to advance in recent
quarters, lifted by increased exploration for natural gas. A trend
toward gas-powered electricity generation is expected to spur the
demand for natural gas for many years. Acting on that expectation,
drillers have tended to look beyond the softness in natural gas
prices of this past year, when technological gains in drilling and
recovery increased the typical yield of a given existing rig,
enabling production gains to outstrip the growth of demand, at least
temporarily.
Inventories
Incoming data show that business inventories continued to
accumulate at a brisk pace in October. Excluding motor vehicles,
book-value stocks in manufacturing and trade expanded at an annual
rate of $62.3 billion in that month. Shipments and sales in
manufacturing and trade were down 0.4 percent in October, and the
non-auto inventory-sales ratio edged up. For some lines of
products, inventories may have been to the high side of desired
levels at the end of October, but serious overhangs have not been
widely cited in recent anecdotal reports.
Manufacturers' inventory investment remained relatively robust
in October. Factory stocks expanded about $20 billion at an annual
rate in that month, only moderately slower than the third-quarter
pace. The basic pattern of manufacturers' inventory change that has
prevailed through much of this year apparently continued in early
autumn. In particular, the October increase was again concentrated
in stocks held at capital goods industries, especially industrial

the capital goods lines has changed little, on net, in recent months
and remains moderately above the lows of late 1994 and early 1995.
The buildup in capital equipment stocks has continued at the
wholesale level as well. In October, stocks held by machinery
dealers and distributors of professional and office equipment rose
sharply again, accounting for the bulk of the wholesale inventory
accumulation in that month. The October rise in stocks of capital
goods followed sizable increases in the inventories of these goods
through much of 1995, and the aggregate inventory-sales ratio for
wholesalers of capital goods has moved up noticeably. Elsewhere in
wholesale trade, the stocks held by distributors of paper products
increased sharply in October, as did the inventories at some other
miscellaneous categories of wholesalers. The ratio of inventories
to sales for wholesalers outside the capital goods area turned back
up in October; it has risen sharply since the start of 1995.
Retail inventories rose sharply in October, led by large run-ups
in stocks at auto dealers and GAF stores. The October accumulation
of GAF stocks, at an annual rate of $11.6 billion, was considerably
above the third-quarter pace. With sales sluggish at GAF stores in
October, the inventory-sales ratio for the group rose to its highest
level of the past two years. However, GAF sales rebounded strongly
in November, according to the advance report on retail sales.
Outside of auto dealers and GAF stores, retail inventory changes

II-35
were relatively modest in October, and inventory-sales ratios
remained within the ranges posted over the past year.
Federal Sector
The federal government recorded a $23 billion deficit in the
unified budget in October. Excluding deposit insurance, the deficit
for October was about $8 billion less than a year earlier. Higher
receipts accounted for $7 billion of this deficit reduction and were
paced by strong individual withheld income taxes. Lower outlays
were responsible for the remaining $1 billion decline in the deficit
excluding deposit insurance. Increased spending for health-related
programs, social security, and net interest was more than offset by
a net reduction in all other spending. The spending restraint seen
in October was consistent with the restrictions imposed by the
continuing resolution that funded most discretionary programs
between October 1 and November 13.
After a partial government shutdown from November 14 to
November 19, a second continuing resolution was passed.6 This
resolution has funded government operations that would have been
covered by the six appropriations bills that are still pending.7
Not all of these remaining appropriations bills are likely to be
signed into law before the continuing resolution expires tomorrow
night, and, therefore, expedient passage of another continuing
6. In general, the current continuing resolution funds programs
at a provisional level equal to the minimum of the fiscal 1995 level
and the levels called for by the House and Senate versions of the
appropriations bills. However, most programs that would have their
funding "significantly reduced" under this formula can have their
funding rate increased to 75 percent of the fiscal 1995 level, and
adequate funding is ensured to avoid worker layoffs.
7. As of December 14, seven appropriations bills had been enacted
(Agriculture, Defense, Energy-Water, Legislative Branch, Military
Construction, Transportation, and Treasury-Postal Service-General
Government) and six remain (Commerce-Justice-State-Judiciary,
District of Columbia, Foreign Operations, Interior, Labor-Health-
Human Services-Education, and Veterans Affairs-Housing-Urban
Development).

resolution would be necessary to avoid a shutdown of government
operations still lacking appropriations.
The President vetoed the budget reconciliation bill passed by
the Congress, which proposed legislative changes to mandatory
spending programs and taxes designed to balance the budget by fiscal
2002. With the intent of helping achieve a compromise budget bill,
the recent continuing resolution required that the effects of the
reconcilication bill be re-estimated using CBO's December update of
economic and technical assumptions. Revisions of these underlying
budget assumptions lowered CBO's baseline projections of the deficit
through fiscal 2002. The CBO estimated that the reconciliation
bill, in conjunction with the proposed discretionary spending caps,
would result in a seven-year deficit total that is $135 billion
below their estimate with the April assumptions that were used in
the budget resolution. However, the re-estimated budget surplus of
$3 billion in fiscal 2002 was little changed from the previous
estimate, because reductions in the deficit for that year due to
revised economic and technical assumptions were approximately offset
by lower estimated budgetary savings from the policy proposals in
the budget bill.
Legislation that would permanently increase the federal
borrowing limit was part of the budget reconciliation bill that the
President vetoed. However, before the veto, the Treasury took
actions to reduce the near-term pressure of a debt limit impasse.
On November 15, the Treasury exercised its authority not to fully
reinvest securities in the Federal Employees Retirement System's
Government Securities Investment Fund and to redeem a portion of the
securities held by the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
These actions created borrowing room of approximately $61 billion,
which should be sufficient to finance government operations until

the end of December. The Treasury has indicated that it will divert
a $14.5 billion interest payment owed to the Civil Service Fund at
the end of this month, which would allow the Treasury to meet
payment demands until about the end of January. Other options that
would further allow federal financing under the current debt limit,
such as tapping some of the $83 billion assets held by the Federal
Financing Bank, are being considered, but Treasury has not released
any longer-term plans at this time.
State and Local Governments
Data available for the fourth quarter suggest that growth in
purchases by state and local governments remained quite strong.
Essentially all of the strength so far has been in construction
spending, which rose 4.5 percent in October following a strong
advance in September. As a result, the level of construction in
October stands 6.4 percent above its average in the third quarter
(not at an annual rate). The recent increases were widespread and
lifted the major categories of construction to levels near or above
past records. In contrast, employment of state and local workers
was flat for the first two months of the fourth quarter.
The fiscal condition of many state governments continued to
improve over the past fiscal year. According to a recent survey by
the National Association of State Budget Officers, balances in state
general fund budgets were equal to 5.7 percent of expenditures at
the end of fiscal 1995, which ended in June 1995 for most states.
The fiscal 1995 figure was up a bit from an already high 1994 level
and resulted primarily from stronger-than-expected tax collections.
Only in a handful of states are budgetary problems still apparent.
Prices
Retail inflation trends appear to be holding steady. Over the
twelve months ended in November, the overall CPI rose 2.6 percent,

little changed from the 2.7 percent increase in the preceding twelve
months. The CPI excluding food and energy increased 3.0 percent in
the latest twelve-month period, up only a touch from the 2.8 percent
rise over the preceding twelve months. Monthly data for November
showed a rise of just 0.1 percent in the index excluding food and
energy; the CPI for all items was unchanged. In the PPI, the index
for finished goods other than food and energy jumped 0.4 percent in
November, but materials prices remained soft.
Consumer energy prices turned back down in November, after a
one-month uptick in October. Gasoline prices fell for the fifth
consecutive month, and heating oil prices also continued to decline.
Price changes for the service fuels were mixed--natural gas prices
fell, but electricity prices rose further after a large increase in
October. In December, a firmer tone has been evident in some of the
indicators of energy prices. Spot prices of fuel oil have been
pushed up in recent weeks by cold temperatures and the related jump
in demand. Upward pressure has also appeared in wholesale markets
for gasoline in recent weeks, and data from Lundburg Surveys suggest
that prices at the pump could move up considerably in December.
After a jump in September, food price increases slowed in
October, and the November data brought a slight decline. Increases
in the prices of cereals, meats, and dairy products were more than
offset last month by a sharp decline in the prices of fresh fruits
and vegetables. Over the past twelve months, the CPI for food has
risen 2.8 percent, somewhat more than the increase over the previous
year. Increases in the price index for food away from home, a
category that is heavily dominated by value added from nonfarm
inputs, has accelerated a little this year. At grocery stores, the
CPI for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs has moved up 3.5 percent over
the past year, after changing little over the previous twelve-month

period, and fruit and vegetable prices have increased appreciably.
By contrast, coffee prices, which soared in 1994, have turned down
in 1995.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy was
unchanged in November, after increasing 0.2 percent in October.
Over the twelve months ended in November, this index for nonfood,
nonenergy goods increased 1.7 percent, slightly more than the
1.5 percent increase recorded in the preceding year. The pickup
resulted from an acceleration in prices of nondurables. Year-to-
year declines in apparel prices have slowed, as these prices have
changed little, on balance, over the past few months. Prices of
household paper products also continue to show large increases from
the levels of a year earlier; however, the twelve-month rate of rise
for this category should start to slow because the prices of paper
products at the intermediate materials stage have been declining in
recent months. Durables prices have changed little over the past
three months; the twelve-month change in these prices was
1.7 percent in November. Auto prices were almost flat in October
and November. Twelve-month increases in new auto prices have slowed
to a pace about half the year-earlier rate.
The prices of nonenergy services increased 0.2 percent in
November, slightly less than the average for the past year. Auto
finance charges continued to move down last month, and the index for
airfares fell sharply, after a sizable rise in October. The indexes
for owners' equivalent rent and residential rent each rose
0.3 percent in November; twelve-month changes in these two series
were 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, about in line with
recent trends.
The November jump in the PPI for finished goods other than food
and energy was the largest increase for that category since January.

Prices of motor vehicles were boosted last month by the first
appearance of some 1996 models in the PPI; more typically, new
models are first captured in the data for October. At earlier
stages of processing, inflation pressures still appear to be
retreating. The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and
energy fell in both October and November. Over the past six months,
this measure has changed little, after rising 7.9 percent in the
preceding twelve months. The improvement reflects the easing this
year of operating rates in materials-producing industries, in the
context of ongoing competitive pressures from foreign producers.
Measures of changes in the prices of raw industrial commodities
have been mixed in recent weeks. The Journal of Commerce commodity
price index has edged up since the week of the last Greenbook, but
the CRB measure of industrial spot prices has moved down further.
Prices of steel scrap have held steady since mid-November. Aluminum
prices have continued to fall in the past six weeks in the face of
higher-than-normal stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses.
Lumber and plywood prices have fallen moderately and are well below
the levels of a year ago.
Prices for agricultural crops have moved higher, on net, since
the last Greenbook. Although these prices fell back a little
through the middle part of November, just after the release of the
USDA's November crop forecast, they have turned back up in early
December. Reduced production in the United States and rising export
demand, especially on the part of China and Korea, has fueled the
run-up in grain and oilseed prices this year. The Agriculture
Department's December assessment of world supply and demand
conditions, released earlier this week, contained no new information
on U.S. production of grains and oilseeds, and revisions to the
agency's forecasts of demand were small; market prices changed

little in the wake of the report. In the livestock markets, prices
for slaughter steers have held steady in recent weeks, and hog
prices have recovered some of the ground they lost earlier this
fall. Increases in farm commodity prices also have been evident in
futures markets and have lifted the CRB futures price index, which
gives heavy weight to farm products.
Price developments of recent months appear to have left a
favorable imprint on consumers' expectations of inflation. Based in
part on preliminary data for December, one-year-ahead inflation
expectations in the Michigan survey averaged 3.5 percent in the
final three months of 1995, compared with year-ahead expectations of
inflation of more than 4 percent in the final quarter of 1994 and in
the first half of 1995. Other measures of inflation expectations
reported by the Michigan survey--including the mean for five to ten
years ahead--also have edged lower, and a little improvement has
been evident as well in expectations data from the Conference Board.
In the Michigan survey, mean expectations of inflation remain above
actual rates of inflation, but the gap has narrowed this year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most interest rates declined over the intermeeting period as
market participants apparently read incoming data as indicating that
economic activity and inflationary pressures were sufficiently
subdued to permit the Federal Reserve to ease money market
conditions during the next several months. Early in the
intermeeting period, the sense that a policy ease was imminent was
bolstered by comments from System officials regarding the prospects
for economic growth and inflation as well as the significance of
potential fiscal restraint. The exception to the general direction
of rates over the period was among maturities of one month, which
crossed over the year-end during the intermeeting period.
Apparently a year-end premium of about 1/2 percentage point,
somewhat less than in previous years, is built into spot and future
rates.
With relatively little news on earnings over the intermeeting
period, recent stock market gains likely reflect the decline in
interest rates. Share prices have moved up about 1 to 5 percent
since the November 15 FOMC meeting, with the Dow pushing past 5200.
Since the beginning of the year, the Dow and the S&P 500 have risen
about 35 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index is up more than
40 percent.
Yields on corporate bonds have declined a bit less than
Treasury rates, but spreads are still narrow by historical
standards. The ratio of long-term tax-exempt to taxable yields has
stayed high, in large part reflecting investors' ongoing concerns
about the possibility of legislation that would reduce or eliminate
the tax advantage of municipal debt. Meanwhile, quality spreads on
long-term municipal bonds remain in the ranges that have prevailed

for a couple of years. The commitment rate on fixed rate mortgages
fell to 7.15 percent--the lowest level since early 1994.
Household debt growth has been running below its pace earlier
in the year. While there has been some moderation in the growth of
consumer credit, available evidence suggests that low mortgage rates
continue to buoy the demand for mortgages. The decline in market
yields has also stimulated bond offerings by nonfinancial firms, but
much of the issuance has been used to pay down short-term credit.
On balance, the expansion of debt of the nonfinancial sectors has
remained moderate in recent months. The broad monetary aggregates,
in contrast, slowed perceptibly in October and November, and their
velocities appear to have turned up in the fourth quarter after two
consecutive quarters of declines.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit1
In November, the broad monetary aggregates continued to grow
more slowly than earlier in the year. Even so, M2 remained in the
upper half of its growth range, and M3 hovered near the upper end of
its range. M2 increased at a 3 percent annual rate in November, and
its fourth-quarter pace is likely to be below that predicted by the
staff's standard money demand model using short-term opportunity
costs. A pickup in stock and bond mutual fund inflows may help to
explain a portion of the slowdown, but by no means all. In fact,
such flows were even heavier in the summer when M2 was unusually
strong. For the year, it appears likely that M2 will exceed the
prediction of the standard model by a couple of percentage points.
Ml fell at a 3-1/2 percent rate in November, with the further
spread of OCD sweep programs depressing growth of this aggregate by
4-1/2 percentage points last month. With five more institutions
implementing sweeps, a total of twenty-two bank holding companies

were operating sweep programs at the end of November. The initial
impact of these programs has been to reduce OCD balances by an
estimated $45 billion. M1 expansion also was held down by slow
currency growth, which has been weak in part because foreign demand
has fallen off in anticipation of the issuance of the new $100 bill,
which is viewed as a superior asset.
M3 grew at a 1 percent pace in November. A factor contributing
to its deceleration was a decrease in large time deposits at foreign
banks. Japanese banks, in particular, have recently increased their
use of funding from their home offices and affiliates, in part
because of rising funding costs in U.S. money markets. M3 was also
held down by the slow expansion of bank credit, which grew at only a
1-1/2 percent pace in November, near October's sluggish rate
(table). Loan growth accelerated a bit, owing largely to a pickup
in business loans related to merger and balance sheet restructuring
activities of a couple of large companies.
Household Debt
Household debt continues to increase at a good clip, although
less rapidly than earlier this year. The latest data show that the
growth in consumer installment credit rebounded in October to a
12-3/4 percent pace from a relatively weak September. Revolving
credit was the fastest-growing component, climbing at a 16 percent
2rate after a quarter of relatively subdued gains. The only data
available for November are for commercial banks, where, after
adjusting for securitization, consumer loans grew at a 12 percent
rate, in line with October's pace and a little below the third-
quarter rate. Even though consumer debt growth has been strong this
2. Contributing to the growth of credit card debt has been the
increased use of credit cards that provide rewards tied to the
dollar volume of charges. Based on various data sources, volume-
related incentives appear to have stimulated transactions use of
credit cards enough to boost the growth of revolving debt in recent
quarters by two to four percentage points.

year, net consumer credit flows in relation to consumption
expenditures are down some this year and are broadly in line with
historical patterns (chart).
Declining mortgage rates have continued to undergird the demand
for home mortgages. Single-family residential mortgage debt grew at
a 6-1/2 percent pace in the third quarter, the most rapid pace since
the end of last year. Although a number of indicators suggest some
easing in housing demand in recent months, the purchase applications
index compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association in the past few
weeks has climbed to its highest level in its six-year history.
Moreover, the refinancing index has risen appreciably from its
recent low in late August.3  Rates on adjustable rate mortgages
have declined more gradually than those on fixed rate mortgages, and
the ARM share of new loans has fallen sharply. Because commercial
banks tend to hold ARMs and securitize fixed rate mortgages, real
estate loan growth at commercial banks has slowed. In turn, net
issuance of securitized mortgages by the agencies increased in
October to a monthly rate of $9.8 billion as compared with
$7.0 billion in the third quarter.
Although most measures of household debt quality have shown
some deterioration over the past year, there is little evidence that
credit supplies have measurably tightened. Delinquency rates on
consumer loans generally have risen more than those for home
mortgages. While some series for consumer debt are at or above
peaks reached in previous business cycles, the mortgage delinquency
rate remains low. The American Bankers Association (ABA) credit
card delinquency rate, which measures the share of the number of
accounts held by commercial banks that are delinquent, is close to
3. Revised data for the mortgage application indexes were
released by the MBA in late November. The revision did not greatly
alter the overall behavior of the indexes.

its previous high (chart). However, the delinquency rate from the
Call Report, which is based on the dollar volume of loans held by
commercial banks, has retraced only a portion of its earlier
decline. Meanwhile, Moody's delinquency rate for accounts that
underlie credit-card-backed securities, which are generally higher-
grade accounts, is near its trough.
Delinquency rates on auto loans also have risen this year
(chart). The rate at captive auto finance companies is above peak
4levels reached during recession periods. However, according to
the ABA, auto loan delinquency rates at commercial banks are well
below levels earlier in the decade. Auto loan delinquencies are not
separately reported on the commercial bank Call Report but are part
of a broader category for closed-end consumer loans. The
delinquency rate on these loans has risen this year; however, the
series is well below past peaks, as is the ABA's aggregate
delinquency rate for all closed-end loans.
Delinquency rates on home mortgages increased slightly in the
third quarter, according to information provided by the Mortgage
Bankers Association, but nevertheless remain near their lowest
levels in more than twenty years (chart). Call Report data for the
third quarter show that delinquencies on home mortgages held by
commercial banks (based on the dollar amount of mortgages
outstanding) rose slightly as well from a very low level.
Business Finance
Gross public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations were
$12-1/2 billion in November, a bit above the already strong pace in
4. The level has been boosted a bit by the shift away from loans
toward leasing over the past few years because leases are not
included in the auto loan delinquency rate and lease customers have
tended to be better credit risks than borrowers. One company has
provided confidential data on both its loan and lease delinquency
rates. Based on these data, the staff estimate that the auto loan
delinquency rate may be elevated by 10 to 20 basis points because of
leasing.

October (table). The bond markets have been supported recently by
the strongest inflows to bond funds in two years. The maturity of
newly issued debt has lengthened recently as nonfinancial
corporations seek to lock in the lowest long-term rates since 1972
other than the brief stretch two years ago. Nonfinancial bond
volume this year is running about 30 percent ahead of last year,
although it remains well below that in 1993, when firms refinanced a
chunk of their outstanding long-term debt. This year, in contrast,
more than half of all bond issuance is estimated to have been used
to pay down commercial paper and bank loans (chart, upper left
panel). This substitution of long-term for short-term debt reduced
the level of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding over October
and November (chart, upper right panel)
Despite the paydowns of bank loans by some nonfinancial
corporations, business loans increased at a 9 percent rate in
November, in large part because of lending to support Westinghouse's
all-cash acquisition of CBS. In addition, a large retailer withdrew
from the commercial paper market in anticipation of a potential
downgrade of its debt to below investment grade and tapped its bank
lines.
Credit quality of below-investment-grade firms has slipped
somewhat this year. The default rate on junk bonds this year--at
2.7 percent--has moved up from the historically low levels of the
past two years, but remains below the average of the prior decade.
The ratio of operating income to interest expense for firms with
junk bonds outstanding has receded from its peak of last year, in
part reflecting higher short-term interest rates (chart, lower right
panel). Because of increased concerns about credit quality,
interest rate spreads on junk bonds relative to Treasuries have
widened on average by 70 or more basis points this year. Even so,

III-14
the spreads remain fairly narrow, and inflows to junk bond funds
have continued at a strong pace. Among firms with junk bonds
outstanding, one area of greater concern is the retail sector, where
the interest coverage ratio has retraced most of its improvement
between 1989 and 1992. In addition, a number of discounters have
filed for bankruptcy protection this year.
In contrast, credit quality of investment-grade firms has shown
no significant deterioration. Balance sheets generally remain
strong, and some large corporations that undertook major cost-
cutting efforts have had their debt ratings raised. As a result,
the value of nonfinancial bonds upgraded by Moody's so far this year
has exceeded those downgraded; this net upgrade is the first in a
number of years (chart, lower left panel). Looking ahead to future
rating changes, the value of debt on Moody's Watchlist for an
immediate review as of November 30 was fairly evenly balanced
between possible upgrades ($27 billion) and downgrades ($36
billion).
Merger activity remained strong during the intermeeting period
with the announcement of five new deals in which the target
company's stock was valued at more than $1 billion. The merger
activity of late appears to have spread to a broader range of
industries than earlier in the year. In particular, a number of
mergers have been announced in the public utility sector as ongoing
deregulation heightens competitive pressures. The wave of mergers
this year generally has not had an adverse effect on credit ratings,
reflecting both the limited amount of leverage involved and the
expectation of strategic gains from the mergers. Taken together,
the announced but not yet completed deals rely even more heavily on
stock swaps than the mergers already completed.

III-15
Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was strong last month,
although off somewhat from October's two-year high (table). The
market for initial public offerings (IPOs), which heated up this
summer, has remained active in recent months; measured by dollar
volume, the average pace of IPO issuance in October and November was
the strongest since late 1993. Preliminary data for the first half
of December suggest that both IPOs and seasoned issuance held at a
fairly high level. Nonetheless, the equity retirements from ongoing
share repurchases and merger activity have continued to outstrip the
pace of new issues.
Municipal Securities
Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities strengthened
in October and November (table). Owing to the continued decline in
long-term rates, refunding activity in recent months has picked up
to the strongest pace since early 1994. However, market contacts
suggest that refunding volume is unlikely to increase much from
recent levels even if long-term rates were to fall somewhat further,
in part because of the limited volume of outstanding bonds remaining
that are eligible for refunding.

Despite the recent rise in issuance, the volume of long-term
offerings so far this year has been about 10 percent below last
year's pace and has been only half that in 1993. when there was a
burst of refundings. Retirements of advance refunded and maturing
bonds continue to outpace gross issuance, causing a sizable drop in
outstanding municipal debt.
With some exceptions, the budget positions of many state and
local governments appear to have improved over the past year.
Quality spreads on long-term municipal bonds have changed little of
late. The spread between the Baa-rated general obligation bond and
a comparable AAA-rated bond stood slightly below 60 basis points in
November, near the middle of the range that has prevailed since the
beginning of 1994.
Treasury and Agency Financing
To avoid default on government obligations maturing in
November, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that he was
liquidating up to $39.8 billion of nonmarketable securities from the
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) and all of the
$21.5 billion of securities in the Federal Employees Retirement Fund
(FERs). The FERs has been disinvested during several debt-ceiling
impasses in the past, but the disinvestment of the CSRDF was
exceptional. To free up $61.3 billion of room under the
$4.9 trillion debt ceiling, the Secretary made the determination
that the debt-ceiling crisis could last a year, allowing him to
disinvest twelve months of securities associated with the payment of
civil service benefits.
By disinvesting these trust funds, the Treasury was able to
hold the auctions of the three- and ten-year notes, which had been
delayed. Auction delays and the threat of a possible debt default
have not had any visible lasting effect on the yields of Treasury

securities. The Treasury has not lifted the suspension of sales of
special issues to state and local governments and has continued to
include foreign official purchases in announced auction amounts,
rather than adding them on, as had been the practice.
Secretary Rubin announced that, by withholding a year-end
interest payment due to CSRDF, the Treasury could stretch its
borrowing into February should the debt ceiling not be raised.
Under this assumption, the staff anticipates that the Treasury will
finance the projected fourth-quarter fiscal deficit of $57 billion
by borrowing $38 billion from the public and by drawing down its
cash balance $19 billion. With no long-term bond in its midquarter
refunding, the Treasury has relied on bills for a third of the funds
raised this quarter and has increased the size of the two- and the
five-year note auctions by $500 million each.
Agencies continue to borrow at the same moderate pace of the
third quarter. New issues are primarily callable debentures, and,
with the exception of step-up notes, few structured notes are being
issued. The agencies continue to be active in the global bond
market; for example, the Federal Housing Finance Board recently
granted the Federal Home Loan Banks a large increase in the amount
that they are authorized to raise in the global market from
$5 billion to $31.5 billion.

APPENDIX
GROWTH OF THE MONETARY AND CREDIT AGGREGATES IN 1995
Summary
M1 contracted in 1995. Weakness in this aggregate reflected
two main factors. First, the spread of sweep arrangements shifted
other checkable deposit (OCD) balances into savings deposits,
reducing both M1 (leaving M2 unchanged) and required reserve
balances. Second, foreign demands for U.S. currency moderated,
removing a factor that had supported growth for the past few years.
In contrast, M2 strengthened in 1995 to its fastest growth in
six years. The nontransaction part of M2 grew faster than it had in
1994, even accounting for sweeps of OCDs to savings. Market
interest rates declined relative to deposit rates, boosting small
time and savings deposits. M2-type money market mutual funds (MMMF)
benefited from the built-in lag of their yields to falling market
interest rates and the flatter yield curve this year.
M3 in 1995 posted its strongest rate of growth in seven years.
In addition to the impetus from M2, the non-M2 portion of M3
rocketed upward, as large time deposits became instrumental in
funding stronger credit expansion at depository institutions.
Growth in M3-type MMMFs was lifted by the decline in short-term
market rates.
Depository credit accelerated in 1995. Some of the pickup in
bank credit reflected the accounting treatment of securities on the
balance sheet and derivative contracts off the balance sheet.
Abstracting from this effect, bank credit expanded 6-1/2 percent
this year, only slightly more than last year's 6 percent. Loan
growth was strong, funded partly by runoffs in security holdings.
Thrift assets ended their long slide, begun in 1989, even as
substantial amounts of assets were lost to commercial banks during
mergers. The stock of depository credit as a share of total
domestic nonfinancial debt edged up for the first time in more than
a decade.
Growth of domestic nonfinancial debt in 1995 continued near
the previous year's rate. A shrinking deficit reduced the growth of
federal debt. A sizable volume of maturing debt and retirements of
callable issues caused state and local debt to run off even faster
than in 1994. Household debt grew somewhat less than it did last
year, as consumer credit, though remaining quite robust, slowed.
All of these components, however, were offset by stronger business
borrowing to finance rapid increases in capital expenditures. Firms
initially tapped the money market and intermediaries and then swung
more toward bond financing when long-term rates fell. Also boosting
debt growth was the hefty volume, on net, of equity retirements
associated with mergers and acquisitions, although many firms took
advantage of the exuberant stock market to issue new equity.
M1
Ml fell 2 percent in 1995, the first annual decline since the
beginning of the Board's official series in 1959. Sweeps of
deposits from OCDs, a component of Ml, to money market deposit
III-A-1

III-A-2
accounts (MMDA), a part of savings deposits in M2, were a major
influence. Without these sweeps, Ml would have risen about
1 percent this year. Since their appearance at in early
1994, sweeps have spread to twenty-five bank holding companies. At
the end of November 1995, the initial impacts of these programs
caused a cumulative decline of $45 billion in transaction deposits.
The corresponding decline in required reserves of about $4.5 billion
largely showedthrough to reserve balances maintained at Federal
Reserve Banks.
The currency component slowed in 1995, primarily owing to
reduced shipments abroad. Foreign demand moderated with the
stabilization of financial conditions in some countries where
dollars circulate widely. In addition, demand for the existing
series of notes slowed in anticipation of a new series, starting
with the $100 bill early next year. Indeed, reduced demand from the
former Soviet Union and reflows from Argentina contributed to actual
declines in the currency component for two months this past summer.
Such monthly declines have been rare, the last occurring in the
early 1960s.
M2
M2 began 1995 hugging the lower bound (1 percent growth) of its
target range. It surged at midyear to touch the upper bound
(5 percent growth) of the range and then edged down in its range,
growing at 4-1/4 percent since the fourth quarter of 1994 and about
matching the projected growth of nominal GDP. This year was the
first since 1991 without a significant increase in the income
velocity of M2.
Declines in interest rates and a flattening of the yield curve
helped to increase demand for household nontransaction components of
M2, holding down the velocity of the entire aggregate. Although
they ran off for the year as a whole, savings deposits were boosted
by sweeps of OCDs into MMDAs. These shifts, which left M2
unaffected, were concentrated in the second half of the year. With
the stance of monetary policy unchanged for several months after the
System's tightening in early February and then eased slightly at
midyear, short-term market interest rates fell somewhat, making
savings deposits, whose offering rates adjust very sluggishly, more
attractive investments and raising growth as the year progressed.
M2-type MMMFs also were aided by the decline in short-term interest
rates, as their yields tend to lag the market. Falling short- and
intermediate-term market interest rates and some upward adjustment
of offering rates narrowed the opportunity cost of small time
deposits and contributed to rapid growth of this component in the
first half of 1995. Although growth of small CDs subsided in the
second half, the net result for the year was a sizable pickup from
growth in 1994.
1. Although the drop in reserve balances has been slightly offset
by an increase in required clearing balances, the net decline in
operating balances at the Reserve Banks has brought them near the
low levels experienced in early 1991, after the Board lowered the
reserve ratios on net Eurocurrency liabilities and nonpersonal time
deposits from 3 percent to zero. That episode was marked by a
considerable increase in volatility in the federal funds market
(since operating balances were close to the level that institutions
would have held voluntarily for clearing purposes) until a partly
seasonal upswing in transaction deposits raised required reserves.

III-A-3
Falling interest rates for comparable maturity instruments were
not the whole story for the growth of nontransactions M2, however.
Declines in long-term interest rates flattened the yield curve by
more than a percentage point. The reduced opportunity cost of
liquidity probably strengthened the household components of M2, as
consumers allocated more of their wealth to these assets.
Nonetheless, the evidence that yield-curve flattening drew
money back into M2 from longer-term assets was mixed. Bond mutual
funds rebounded from their runoffs in 1994, although net sales were
much weaker than they were in the 1992-93 period of steep yield
curves. (Equity mutual funds continued to have robust inflows
throughout the year.) On the other hand, direct investment in
debt instruments appears to have lessened, at least as seen in the
abrupt fall of noncompetitive tenders for Treasury securities after
the beginning of 1995. By themselves, noncompetitive tenders can
explain only a small part of the pickup in M2 deposits, but
noncompetitive tenders for Treasuries are only a part of direct
retail demand for debt securities.
The volatile overnight RP and overnight Eurodollar components
exerted a drag on M2 growth in 1995 as they both slowed from hefty
increases the previous year. Despite their overnight maturity these
liabilities have behaved in recent years more like managed
liabilities than like core deposits, and their weakness this year
reflected a shift toward large time deposits, discussed in the next
section.
M3
M3 grew at a 6 percent rate in 1995, its fastest rise since
1988. Like M2, the M3 aggregate expanded moderately early in the
year, surged in the second and third quarters, and cooled off near
year-end. M3 breached the upper bound of its 2 to 6 percent target
range by midyear and remained substantially above it until returning
almost to the upper bound near year-end.
M3-type MMMFs rebounded smartly in 1995 after having run off
the previous two years. These funds benefited from the typical lag
in their yields to the decline in short-term market interest rates.
Increases in the sum of the term RP and term Eurodollar components
of M3 about matched those in 1994.
2. Strong flows into stock mutual funds are not inconsistent with
a revival of M2 deposits, however, especially since flows out of
household direct holdings of equity were substantial in the first
half of 1995.
3. The negative correlation between overnight RPs and demand
deposits, evident in the 1970s before overnight RPs were included in
M2, has disappeared. Increasingly, depository institutions have
managed these instruments to smooth out funding needs instead of
merely responding to customer demand. As a result these components
will be removed from M2 during the February 1996 benchmark of the
monetary aggregates and combined with their corresponding term
liabilities in non-M2 M3. The table shows that, except for 1994,
the combined effect of these components on annual growth of M2 has
been very small. Comparisons of monthly and quarterly growth rates
(not shown on the table) suggest that M2 at these frequencies will
be little affected by this further redefinition.
4. In July 1995 the FOMC revised up the range for M3 from 0 to 4
percent to 2 to 6 percent.

III-A-4
Even though these nondeposit components as a group accelerated
in 1995, the pickup in M3's growth this year owed importantly to the
use of large time deposits to fund credit growth at depository
institutions. After bottoming out in the middle of 1994, the large
time deposit component began a climb that steepened through 1995, as
large CDs were, in general, substituted for nondeposit sources of
funds, first at domestic banks and thrift institutions and shortly
thereafter at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Late in
the year branches and agencies of Japanese banks, facing some
resistance in U.S. funding markets, ran off CDs while continuing to
increase their funding from overseas offices.
Depository Credit
The composition of bank credit growth for most of 1995 followed
the pattern of 1994--rapid growth of loans and subdued growth of
securities. Business loans grew robustly in the first part of 1995,
boosted by the need to finance inventories and by shifts toward
short-term financing as nonfinancial firms waited for a more
favorable climate for bond issuance. Business loan growth then
cooled off in the second half as capital markets rallied.
Qualitative information suggested that the easing of business loan
standards by lenders virtually ceased, although some easing of
credit terms continued. Real estate loans, too, had an impressive
first half but slowed near year-end despite declines in mortgage
interest rates throughout the year. The increasing share of fixed
rate mortgages (which tend to be securitized) in total originations
probably contributed to the slowdown. In addition, bank loan
officers indicated a slight movement toward tighter mortgage
underwriting standards during the year. Consumer loans on the books
of banks began the year growing at very high rates; this growth
decelerated throughout 1995 as the volume of securitization
increased. Adjusted for estimated securitizations, consumer loans
maintained an elevated 15 percent rate of growth before slowing a
bit in the last quarter of the year.
Mark-to-market effects inflated the growth of the securities
component of bank credit by an estimated 4-3/4 percentage points in
1995. Without these influences, securities in bank credit would
have run off slightly, thereby clearly showing that banks drew down
their liquid assets to meet loan demand.
Data through the second quarter showed total assets of thrift
institutions rising at a 1-3/4 percent annual rate, for the first
increase since 1989. Growth at healthy thrifts more than offset a
substantial transfer of thrift assets to commercial banks through
mergers. These acquisitions raised the growth of bank credit by 3/4
percentage point in 1995. The revival of growth in thrift assets,
along with the strong showing of bank credit, helped to nudge up
depository credit as a share of domestic nonfinancial debt.
5. A solution to the mismatch between BIF and SAIF insurance
premiums, by recapitalizing SAIF with a one-time assessment and by
sharing between banks and thrifts the responsibility for paying off
the (FICO) bonds issued as part of the thrift bailout, has been
agreed to by the legislative and executive branches. However, it is
tied up as part of the federal budget reconciliation bill, which has
not yet been passed. This part of the bill also would provide some
tax relief to thrifts that lose their status as qualified thrift
lenders and could spur more movement of thrift assets into the
(Footnote continues on next page)

III-A-5
Domestic Nonfinancial Debt
Debt growth for nonfinancial sectors was little changed in 1995
relative to 1994, as a slowdown in federal borrowing was offset by
an acceleration in nonfederal borrowing. Although the business
sector's internal funds from profits and depreciation rose in 1995,
they did not keep pace with capital expenditures, leading to
increased demands for credit. Net borrowing by nonfinancial
businesses rose sharply, as firms financed both inventory and
equipment with bank loans and commercial paper. As the year went
on, businesses took advantage of lower long-term interest rates to
increase bond issuance, some of which replaced short-term financing
and some of which was net new funding.
In contrast to the nonfinancial business sector, debt growth
among households ebbed somewhat from last year's pace. Home
mortgage debt expanded at about the same rate as last year, even
though mortgage interest rates fell substantially. Consumer credit
growth was lower than last year's rate, reflecting the slowdown in
spending on durables and perhaps added caution as debt service
burdens rose.
Debt of state and local governments fell more in 1995 than in
1994, as retirements, especially of issues pre-refunded a few years
earlier, further outpaced sluggish gross issuance. Despite the
overall reduction in supply, the ratio of tax-exempt yields to
taxable yields jumped in the first half of the year on concerns
about the effect of congressional tax proposals on demands for
municipal debt. Continued uncertainty about tax treatment kept the
yield ratio for long-term debt at an elevated level for the
remainder of the year.
In the fiscal year ended on September 30, 1995, the unified
federal deficit shrank about $40 billion, to $164 billion, resulting
in a slowdown in federal debt growth. On a calendar-year basis the
deficit appears to have declined by about the same amount, with
outlays in the fourth quarter of 1995 held down by conflict over the
budget.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In September, the deficit in goods and services was about the same
as in August but well below the July level, as both exports and imports
rose by about 1-1/2 percent. For the third quarter, the deficit was
significantly less than in the second quarter.

Exports of goods and services rose 1 percent in the third
quarter, with increases recorded in most major categories of trade.
The sharpest increases were in machinery (particularly to developing
Asian countries), automotive products to Canada (from relatively low
levels) and to other countries, and agricultural products
(especially quantities of wheat and corn, reversing second-quarter
declines). These increases were partly offset by a drop in exports
of aircraft and gold.
Imports of goods and services declined about 1 percent in the
third quarter. Most of the decline occurred in trade categories in
which imports had increased sharply in the second quarter -- oil,
gold, other industrial supplies, and automotive products from
countries other than Canada or Mexico.

Oil Imports
The total quantity of oil imported in September rose despite
lower oil consumption, partly because of seasonal inventory
accumulation and partly because of a decline in production.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil
imports fell in October due to a reversal of both of these factors.
The price of imported oil fell $1.50 per barrel in the third
quarter, reflecting previous declines in spot prices as the market
came to expect an over-abundant world oil supply. More recently,
the September WTI spot price rose $0.20 per barrel on concerns about
low U.S. inventories and possible production disruptions due to
hurricane damage. The October spot price declined about $0.80 as
the hurricane season neared its end and on the possible return of
Iraqi crude to the market. Spot WTI rose $0.55 in November due to
an output loss in Mexico, concerns of oil worker strikes in
Venezuela and Brazil, and an OPEC decision to maintain its existing
production quota.
Prices of Merchandise Non-Oil Imports and Exports
In October, the average price of U.S. non-oil imports
decreased for the second consecutive month. The sharpest declines
were in prices of imported foods and capital goods. Smaller price
declines were recorded for imported industrial supplies and consumer
goods. The price of imported automotive products increased
slightly.
The average price of U.S. exports increased very slightly in
October, about the same as in September. As in September, the
October increase was led by an upswing in prices of exported
agricultural products, especially grains. Prices of nonagricultural
products decreased for the fourth consecutive month as prices of
industrial supplies continued to drop.

U.S. Current Account through 1995-Q3
In the third quarter, the U.S. current account deficit
narrowed $15.1 billion (SAAR) from the level reported (revised) in
the second quarter. A reduction in the trade deficit was partially
offset by larger net outflows of investment income and unilateral
transfers.

The larger deficit in investment income was mostly accounted
for by reduced net direct investment income, as direct investment
payments rose with increased U.S. earnings and receipts declined on
lower earnings abroad. Net portfolio income payments also increased
slightly, as U.S. net liabilities edged higher.
The small increase in unilateral transfers in the third
quarter resulted from a rise in U.S. government grants.

IV-7
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets in the United States declined
marginally in October, following a very strong third quarter (line 1
of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Japanese
official assets fell somewhat in October, after moderate increases
throughout the third quarter (increases far less than reported
Japanese intervention purchases of dollars during the same period).
The October data also showed a decline in Brazilian and Mexican
official holdings, after substantial buildups in the third quarter.
Increases in Chinese holdings in the United States slowed in October
from a rapid third-quarter pace, but information from the FRBNY
indicates a renewed pickup in November.
A large banking inflow in October reversed the outflow
registered in the third quarter (line 2). Over half of the October
net inflow was attributable to affiliates of Japanese banks,
continuing a pattern set in the third quarter in response to their
funding needs and the premia they faced. Monthly average data show
further net inflows to foreign-chartered banks in November (line lb
of International Banking Data table).
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. Treasuries were negative
in September, but rebounded somewhat in October (line 4a of the
Summary table). Much of the variability was caused by the high
volatility of holdings in the Netherlands Antilles (presumably
controlled by hedge funds): net sales of $6 billion in September
turned around to net purchases of $15 billion in October. Japanese
residents sold Treasuries net in both months, $2.9 billion in
September and $8.6 billion in October, almost reversing the large
net purchases in July and August.
Net foreign purchases of corporate and other bonds remained
strong throughout the third quarter and into October (line 4b).

IV-10
Eurobond sales by U.S. companies remained strong in November. Worth
noting is the high percentage of newly issued Eurobonds that have
been denominated in foreign currencies: almost 50 percent of new
issues in September and 32 percent in October. Nine different
foreign currencies were represented among the 28 such issues in
October, among them the Czech Koruna and the South African Rand.
Anecdotal evidence points to a number of factors that have played a
role in the proliferation of foreign-currency denominated issues.
Favorable swap spreads have been cited, as well as the desire to tap
new sources of capital.
U.S. purchases of foreign securities were substantial in
September, leading to a strong third quarter, and continued in
October (line 5). Bond purchases for the quarter were concentrated
in Europe, Canada and Japan. Over half the net purchases of foreign
stocks in the third quarter were from Japan; another $7 billion was
from Europe, with virtually nothing from Latin America. In October,
most of the bond and stock purchases were in Europe and the
Caribbean, with little net activity in Japan.
Recently released balance-of-payments data for the third
quarter showed a strong outflow of U.S. direct investment abroad and
an almost equally strong inflow to foreign direct investors in the
United States; flows in both directions were swelled by takeovers.
The statistical discrepancy for the third quarter was a negative
$23.3 billion, in contrast to the positive values for the first two
quarters of the year.

the Japanese yen. The dollar appreciated about 1-1/4 percent against the
Canadian dollar while it rose 1 percent against the British pound and 1/2
percent against the Italian lira.
During the intermeeting period, market expectations have focused
on the potential for further monetary easing in Germany amid gathering
evidence that German economic growth and inflation have slowed. Recent
data have been suggestive of weakness in other European countries as
well, and European 10-year government bond yields declined during the
intermeeting period. Yields on German and French 10-year bonds
decreased about 25 basis points, while 10-year rates were down about 35
basis points in the United Kingdom, and more than 50 basis points in
Italy and Sweden. One factor behind the substantial decline in Italian
long-term interest rates has been reports that the Italian government is
considering the elimination of a withholding tax currently levied on
foreign bond holders. The yield on Canadian 10-year government bonds
fell 25 basis points, about the same magnitude of the decline in U.S. 10-
year rates over the period.
Short-term market interest rates in Germany fell 20 basis points
from their level at the time of the November 15 FOMC meeting. The decline
in short-term rates occurred on December 14, when the Bundesbank
announced 50-basis-point cuts in its discount and Lombard rates to 3
percent and 5 percent, respectively. The Bundesbank also announced that
its next three repurchase tenders would be conducted at a fixed rate of
3.75 percent, compared with a minimum rate of 3.98 percent at the past
three repo operations. The Belgian, Dutch, Austrian and Danish central
banks swiftly followed the German lead and lowered official rates, but
the Bank of France did not immediately respond to the German rate cut.
The Swiss National Bank also cut its discount rate by 50 basis points to
1-1/2 percent on December 14. U.K. monetary authorities lowered their
official minimum lending rate 25 basis points to 6-1/2 percent on

IV-13
December 13 and 3-month interest rates in the United Kingdom fell about
25 basis points over the intermeeting period.
In France, official rates had been lowered about 1/4 percentage
point on November 16, in support of the government's social welfare
reform package released the day earlier. However, since then a series of
public sector strikes in protest of the proposed fiscal reforms have
raised questions about the viability of the government's budget deficit
reduction goals. At times during the intermeeting period, concerns over
the magnitude of government concessions to the unions weighed on the
franc. The Bank of France lowered its intervention rate by 10 basis
points on December 7, in part to signal its support for the reform
effort. French short-term interest rates rose and fell as pressures on
the French franc waxed and waned during this period. On balance, French
3-month rates fell almost 50 basis points as strike activity currently
seems to have ebbed, reducing pressures on the franc.
Japanese short-term interest rates were little changed since the
last FOMC meeting and the rate on 10-year benchmark bonds declined only
slightly. Japanese stock prices rose 9 percent, led by a 12 percent rise
in bank stocks. The banks' disclosure of the total amount of their
restructured loans was ahead of schedule and may have reassured market
participants. The announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it will
reveal a plan to deal with bad loans at financial institutions by the end
of the year also may have helped bolster bank stock prices. The premium
that Japanese banks paid in recent months on 3-month dollar deposits
narrowed considerably since the November 15 FOMC meeting while the
premium paid by Japanese banks on 1-month dollar deposits widened,
mainly reflecting year-end funding pressures.
The Mexican peso appreciated about 2 percent against the dollar
over the intermeeting period, as pressures on Mexican financial markets
abated. Short-term interest rates declined about 10 percentage points
on balance while stock prices surged nearly 15 percent. Since the

IV-14
November 15 FOMC meeting, spreads on Mexican Brady bonds narrowed nearly
2 percentage points. Following a period of no significant foreign
exchange intervention since March, Mexican authorities recently have
adopted a slightly more aggressive approach to exchange rate management.
The Desk did not intervene in foreign exchange markets during the
intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Third-quarter GDP data and available fourth-quarter indicators
point to subdued economic growth in the major foreign industrial
countries. The Japanese economy has yet to begin a sustained recovery.
There was little or no growth in France and Germany in the third quarter,
and the current quarter also looks weak. Growth in Canada and the United
Kingdom is modest. Only in Italy does growth in the second half of 1995
appear strong.
Inflation abroad remains low on average. Prices have continued to
fall in Japan, while consumer-price inflation in Canada has declined
from its peak in the first half of the year. In the United Kingdom
inflation has fallen slightly after being pushed up by temporary factors
in the summer. Italy has experienced the highest inflation rate among
the major industrial countries, as consumer-price inflation edged up to
6 percent in the twelve months through November.
Major economic and financial uncertainties exist in several
countries. In France, the outcome of the showdown between the government
and public-sector unions may determine whether EMU will proceed on
schedule. In Japan, concerns about the health of the banking sector
persist, although the funding premium for Japanese banks in Eurocurrency
markets has declined to a modest level. In Canada, uncertainty remains

IV-15
about the future of the federal structure following the narrow defeat of
the Quebec sovereignty referendum in late October.
Individual country notes. In Japan, recently released third-
quarter data confirm a very slow growth rate of GDP in 1995. However, the
underlying data present a more promising picture, as domestic demand has
continued to strengthen, led by rising consumption. After three years of
declining, investment has increased so far this year despite some
weakness in the third quarter. Higher domestic demand has not led to
higher output because the yen appreciation of 1994 and early 1995 has
depressed real net exports. If the more recent yen depreciation
persists, the current quarter should be the last quarter in which real
net exports are a significant drag on growth.

In the Bank of Japan's November survey (Tankan) , the index of
business sentiment of major manufacturing firms (the percentage having a
favorable view of business conditions minus the percentage with an
unfavorable outlook) registered -14, slightly less negative than the
previous survey taken in August.
The Japanese current account surplus has continued to decline,
registering $114 billion (SAAR) in the year through October, down about
$16 billion from the same period last year. In the year through October
the merchandise trade surplus (SAAR) was $108 billion, down about $11
billion from a year earlier.
In Germany, data for the third quarter confirm a marked slowing of
real activity from the 2-1/2 percent annual rate pace registered in the
first half of this year. A 1.2 percent (SAAR) increase in domestic
demand (due largely to inventories) was offset by a drop in net exports.
Few monthly indicators are available for the fourth quarter, but
those that are do not suggest a rebound in activity. Labor market data
indicate a rise in unemployment of 42,000 in November, putting total
unemployed at more than 3.7 million. Consumer price inflation has

IV-17
remained subdued, with the twelve-month increase just at 1.5 percent in
November.

On December 14, the Bundesbank announced an objective for the
growth of the targeted monetary aggregate M3 of 4 to 7 percent in 1996
(fourth quarter to fourth quarter) .Through October, M3 was 1.7 percent
(SAAR) above its base in the fourth quarter of 1994.
The Bundestag has approved the 1996 budget, which now awaits
approval by the Bundesrat. Opposition Social Democrats have suggested
that a shortfall in tax revenue in 1996 may necessitate a supplementary
budget.
In France, modest GDP growth in the third quarter, coupled with a
downward revision to 0.8 percent in second-quarter growth (from 1.6
percent SAAR), suggest a pronounced slowing of the economy. Private
consumption contracted, after growing strongly during the second
quarter in anticipation of the expiration of the government's auto
subsidy program and the 2 percentage point increase in the VAT on August
1. A rebound in investment coupled with a slight rise in government
consumption contributed positively to third-quarter growth. A negative
contribution from net exports, associated with a sharp increase in
imports, was almost entirely offset by inventory accumulation.

Monthly indicators suggest that economic activity is slowing
further in the current quarter. In October, consumer spending on
manufactured goods (equal to one-third of total consumption) registered
the sharpest decline since January 1993. A consumer confidence survey by
INSEE (taken before the onset of the public sector strikes) indicates
that consumer confidence continued to decline in November, reaching its
lowest level in over two years. The unemployment rate remained unchanged
in October after having risen slightly in September.
In November, year-over-year consumer price inflation was little
changed from the third-quarter average. The modest pick-up in inflation
since August is attributable to an increase in the VAT on August 1.

In November, the French government outlined new measures designed
to reform the social welfare system. These measures are intended to
eliminate the deficit on social security (estimated at more than $12
billion in 1995) by 1997 and reduce France's general government deficit
to 3 percent of GDP, as required by the Maastricht Treaty for European
Monetary Union. The announced package includes a combination of spending
cuts and tax increases. The major proposals entail reforms to limit the
growth in health care expenditures, a freeze on family benefits in 1996
and 1997 (with such benefits becoming taxable in 1997), a lengthening of
the number of years public sector employees must work in order to obtain

IV-20
full pension benefits, and a widening of the broad-based income tax known
as the GSG.
Several national trade unions have mounted a series of broad-based
public-sector strikes aimed at derailing this social welfare reform. In
negotiations with the unions the government has agreed to some weakening
of the reforms, but a final agreement has not been reached. We expect
that these strikes, which have extended into their third week, will
further depress economic activity in the current quarter.
In Italy, consumer price inflation rose further in November.
The year-over-year change in the consumer price index reached 6.0
percent in November, slightly higher than the 5.8 percent increase in the
previous three months. Wholesale price inflation in September was also
up a little from the August level while wage inflation in October
remained at 4 percent on a year-over-year basis, the same as in
September.

Monthly indicators suggest strong real GDP growth in the third
quarter. Industrial production rose sharply in August and was nearly 4
percent above the second-quarter level on average in July and August.

IV-21
Consumer confidence also increased. In the second quarter, real GDP had
declined by a small amount primarily due to a drop in inventory
investment.
On November 21, the Italian government launched its biggest ever
privatization by offering 14.7 percent of the state energy firm ENI.
Together with earlier privatization receipts, the $3.9 billion revenue from
the offer would allow the government to reach its 1995 privatization target
of $6.2 billion. In 1995, privatization receipts are projected to total
approximately 7.5 percent of the budget deficit.
The slowdown in output growth in the United Kingdom now appears
more pronounced as the most recent national income data lowered real GDP
growth in the third quarter to 1. 6 percent from the preliminary estimate
of 2.0 percent. GDP growth was even more sluggish when oil and gas
extraction are excluded. A sharp contraction of investment held down
domestic demand even though consumption grew at a pace close to its
recent average. There was also a noticeable increase in inventory
accumulation in the third quarter.

Recent activity data appear to be consistent with a softening trend
in aggregate demand. The purchasing managers' index fell to 49.6 in
November from 50.5 in October and 50.4 in September. The October
quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry also showed
that firms are lowering near-term output plans as they express concerns
about excessive stock holding and weaker export orders. Industrial
output fell nearly 1 percent in October.

After rising to 3.1 percent in September, retail price inflation
excluding mortgage interest payments fell slightly in October and was
unchanged in November. Recent movements in producer prices indicate
that inflationary pressures may be moderating. The growth rate of
average earnings continues to be modest, although there may be some
slight upward pressure on labor costs. According to a survey of private-
sector pay settlements, the average pay increase in new wage agreements
rose to 3.5 percent in October after remaining in the low 3 percent range
earlier this year.
On November 28, the government released its budget in which the
projected public-sector borrowing requirement for the current fiscal

FY94/95.
Economic activity in Canada expanded 2.1 percent (SAAR) in the
third quarter, following a 0.6 percent contraction in the second
quarter. Statistics Canada attributed much of the increase to a
resurgence of growth in the United States that boosted Canadian exports.
Final domestic demand contracted slightly, as robust consumption
expenditures were offset by decreases in machinery and equipment
investment, residential construction, and government expenditures. A
reduced pace of inventory accumulation also subtracted from growth.

Preliminary indicators of economic activity for the fourth quarter
are limited but suggest that growth remains modest. Employment fell in
November, offsetting October's gains, and average employment in October
and November was only 0.2 percent above the third-quarter average.
Housing starts picked up somewhat in November, but the level remained
below the third-quarter average. After rising to near the top of the
Bank of Canada's inflation target band of 1 to 3 percent in the second

quarter, consumer price inflation has continued to decline through
November.

Prime Minister Chretien introduced a three-part package in
Parliament that fulfills promises made during the Quebec referendum
campaign. The plan includes recognition of Quebec as a distinct society,
the right of any of five regions of Canada -- Quebec, Ontario, British
Columbia, the prairie provinces, and the Atlantic provinces -- to veto
proposed changes in the Constitution, and decentralization of some
government programs. Although the House of Commons has passed the first
two parts of the package, polls suggest that the proposals have limited
popular support both inside and outside of Quebec.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity picked up in Mexico in the third quarter, but
declined in Argentina and Brazil. Growth remained strong in the major
Asian developing countries, although the pace has moderated recently in
China and Taiwan. In Russia, economic activity appears to have
stabilized.
The weakness in economic activity in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil
has contributed to the turnaround in these countries' trade balances.
However, in Venezuela, import growth was high, and the trade deficit
remains sizable. On December 11, Venezuela devalued the bolivar by 41
percent. Both exports and imports grew rapidly in the Asian developing
countries, while movements in trade balances have been mixed.
Inflation in Argentina and Brazil has continued to decline, but
progress toward reducing inflation in Mexico and Venezuela appears to
have slowed in recent months. Inflation in the Asian countries continues
to slow.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, output is estimated to have
increased about 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter, on a seasonally
adjusted basis (not an annual rate), after declining 8 percent in the
second quarter. However, for statistical reasons, both the second-
quarter decline and third-quarter increase are somewhat overstated. The
year-over-year decline in industrial production was about 11 percent in
September, a little bit smaller than the August decline. The
unemployment rate (n.s.a.) fell in both September and October.
Inflation, after declining steadily from its April peak of 8
percent at a monthly rate, ticked up to 2.1 percent in September and
October, and to 2.5 percent in November. These developments raise
concerns that progress toward reducing inflation in the wake of last
December's devaluation of the peso may be slowing, although the November
rise in part reflects a seasonal, year-end upturn in inflation.

IV-29
In part reflecting the continued weakness of the economy, Mexico's
trade performance remains strong. The trade surplus for the January-
October period registered $6.2 billion compared with a $15.2 billion
deficit for the same period in 1994. Moreover, the current account
surplus continued to rise in the third quarter, reducing the deficit for
the first three quarters of the year to $0.2 billion compared with a
deficit of $21.3 billion in the first three quarters of 1994.

Mexico's non-financial public sector registered a fiscal surplus
of about 1.5 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1995, well in
excess of the target of 0.5 percent of GDP specified in the authorities'
economic program for 1995. The primary (non-interest) surplus, about 6
percent of GDP, was also higher than the target of 4.4 percent. Based on
Mexico's compliance with the end-September performance criteria, the
IMF is expected to release a further $1.6 billion disbursement.
The condition of the Mexican banking sector has continued to
deteriorate, partly because of recent sharp increases in interest rates
and weak economic activity. The share of non-performing loans in total
loans outstanding has risen from 9 percent at end-1994 to 18 percent at
the end of October. On December 1, the authorities announced that they
would take majority control of Banco Inverlat, Mexico's fifth largest

IV-30
bank, owing to its weakened financial condition, although the bank's
management would be left unchanged for the present.
In Argentina, consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in November from a
year earlier. Real GDP for the second quarter was 4.6 percent below its
year-earlier level. However, recent data suggest that the economy may
have bottomed out in the third quarter. In the first ten months of 1995,
exports rose by 36 percent over a year earlier, while imports declined
almost 10 percent. Gross international reserves have remained steady in
the last month and stood at $14.8 billion on November 30, of which $2.5
billion is in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds. The monetary base was
$11.1 billion, leaving $3.7 billion in excess reserves.

Argentina met the fiscal and monetary performance criteria under
its IMF program for the third quarter, which will allow the government to
receive about $400 million from the IMF before the end of 1995.
Moreover, the government is negotiating with the IMF for a new one-year
$1 billion stand-by arrangement. However, tax revenues are still
consistently under target, and it appears that the government will reach
its IMF-agreed criterion for 1995 of an overall balanced budget only with
the proceeds of a tax moratorium, which has yielded approximately $3.9
billion.

IV-31
In Venezuela, twelve-month consumer price inflation was 53 percent
in November, almost unchanged from October. Venezuela registered a
merchandise (non-oil) trade deficit of $4.3 billion for the first eight
months of 1995, up from a deficit of $2.6 billion during the same period
in 1994, reflecting a 40 percent increase in imports and a 17 percent
increase in exports.

On December 11, following several weeks of speculation that a
devaluation was imminent, Venezuela devalued the bolivar by 41 percent.
Negotiations with the IMF continue without significant progress.
In addition, President Caldera's decision to replace the progressive
President of the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) , Carlos Bernardez, on
November 20 has been interpreted in financial markets as an indication of
his reluctance to carry out free market reforms. The rise in the
expectations of a devaluation over the last month, as well as President
Caldera's lack of commitment to reform, contributed to a fall in
international reserves excluding gold to their lowest levels this year;
they stood at $5.6 billion at the end of October compared with $7 billion
at the end of June.
In an effort to cover external and domestic debt-service payments
through the end of the year. Venezuela returned to financial markets for
the first time since 1993 by issuing a 3-year DM500 million ($357
million) bond at a 10 percent fixed rate with a spread of 559 basis points

IV-32
over a comparable German government bond. Between late November and
year-end 1995, the government owes about $450 million in external
obligations, including Brady bond interest payments (with $231 million
due on December 18) , monies owed to multilaterals, and amortization of
the Austrian schilling bond issue in 1993. While the government has set
money aside to cover some of these external obligations, it plans to
accumulate around $850 million in arrears with the Paris Club as a means
of financing the deficit.
In Brazil, seasonally adjusted real GDP declined sharply in both
the second and third quarters. However, on a year-over-year basis, real
GDP growth was still positive. Inflation has remained low by Brazilian
standards.

The economic contraction contributed to a narrowing of the current
account deficit in the third quarter of 1995, as the sizeable trade
deficits over the first two quarters shifted to small trade surpluses in
the third quarter.
In November, the Central Bank enacted a new program that will
inject funds and provide other assistance to encourage weak banks to
merge with healthier banks. The program is the latest attempt by the

IV-33
Central Bank to respond to banking difficulties that have emerged in
recent months due to the deterioration in asset quality.
In China, the rate of growth of economic activity and the inflation
rate appear to be moderating. China ran a trade surplus of $17.8 billion
in the first ten months of 1995, well above its surplus of $2.2 billion in
the same period a year ago. This surplus largely reflects a surge in
exports in the first half of 1995, when the value of exports rose 45
percent; for the July-October period, exports rose 19 percent. Import
growth, by contrast, has been relatively steady over the year, with
growth of 16 percent in the first ten months of 1995. At the end of
October 1995, China's total reserves less gold reached $73 billion, up
$21 billion from the end of 1994.

In mid-November, Chinese authorities announced plans to cut
tariffs on about 4,000 goods. Although few details were given, the
reductions are expected to be implemented in the next few months.
However, authorities reportedly have decided to eliminate provisions
allowing foreign-invested enterprises to import capital equipment free
of tariffs and value added tax. Foreign commentators suggest this may
raise the cost of direct investment in China by 20 to 50 percent,
depending on the extent of Chinese tariff cuts.
In Taiwan, real GDP growth slowed slightly in the third quarter,
and industrial production growth slowed substantially in October. The
trade surplus in the first eleven months of 1995 declined slightly from

its year-earlier level; the value of exports rose 23 percent while
imports rose 25 percent.

Real GDP in Korea expanded rapidly during the third quarter.
However, recent data indicating a marked deceleration of capital goods
imports in the past few months and of industrial production in October
suggest that the pace of the current expansion has begun to slow. The
central bank seems likely to keep inflation below its target rate of 5
percent: consumer prices were 4.3 percent higher in November than their
year-earlier level.
Merchandise exports rose by 35 percent during the first ten months
of this year from their year-earlier level. However, imports expanded by
36 percent, reflecting in part extremely rapid growth in capital goods
imports during the first half of the year. Because imports began from a
higher base, this contributed to a substantial deterioration of Korea's
current account balance over that period.

During November, Russian monthly consumer price inflation
remained at 5 percent, and the ruble depreciated slightly against the
dollar. The monetary base during October increased by only 1 percent,
following monthly growth of over 10 percent earlier in the year. Real
GDP and industrial production during the first ten months of 1995 were
only slightly below their levels during the same period of 1994,
following several years of sharp declines.
Russia has successfully completed two quarterly reviews and seven
monthly reviews under its IMF stand-by arrangement, satisfying all of
the program's performance criteria and quantitative indicative targets.
The fiscal deficit during October was somewhat larger than in previous
months (reflecting spending pressures as the December 17 parliamentary
elections approach), but the cumulative 1995 deficit remained well below
the requirements of the IMF program.
In late November, Sergei Dubinin, the Acting Minister of Finance in
1994, was confirmed as Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. Dubinin
indicated that he intends to continue the tight policies initiated by
Mrs. Paramonova. On November 30, the ruble exchange rate band was
extended through June 1996. Effective January 1, however, the band will
be 4550-5150 rubles per dollar, rather than the current 4300-4900 rubles
per dollar.
