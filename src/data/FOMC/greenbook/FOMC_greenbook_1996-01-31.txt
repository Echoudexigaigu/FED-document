text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
As 1996 began, the economy appeared to be expanding, but only
slowly. Data are lagging because of the December and January
government shutdowns, but the available information indicates fairly
clearly that manufacturing activity has been on the soft side
recently--owing in part, we suspect, to efforts by businesses in a
number of sectors to curb inventory accumulation. Even so, the
labor market remained fairly taut, at least through December, with
growth in jobs continuing at a moderate clip; hourly earnings
figures last year hinted at some firming in wages. Because of the
delays in the PPI and CPI releases, we have no timely statistical
information on broad price movements; apart from pressures in
agricultural and energy markets, however, the price inflation
picture still appears fairly calm.
Labor Market Developments
Labor market conditions were little changed in December and
remained in line with those generally prevailing over the second
half of 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment expanded 150,000, and the
unemployment rate stayed at 5.6 percent. Although aggregate hours
of private production or nonsupervisory employees fell 0.2 percent
last month, the increase in the quarterly average of this measure of
labor input, 2.1 percent, was about the same as that in the third
quarter.
Several statistical problems raise some uncertainty about the
reliability of the estimated changes in payrolls for recent months.
Because of the federal government shutdown, the BLS was unable to
incorporate the additional responses to the November payroll survey
into revised levels of employment, hours, and earnings for November.
However, in estimating the change in employment from November to
December, the BLS was able to match the expanded set of responses

for November with a relatively good initial set of December reports
that the states had taken more time to collect and verify during the
delay. Thus, the reported estimates of November-to-December changes
in the payroll series may be more reliable than the levels reported
for either month. Nonetheless, because the BLS had to deviate from
its normal procedures in processing the data, we suggest
interpreting all the recent payroll series with some caution,
although we have no basis for thinking the alternative approach has
biased the estimates either up or down.
On a different statistical issue, the BLS suggested that some
seasonal hiring that would normally have been captured in December
may have been picked up by the relatively late November survey,
tending to inflate the October-to-November change in employment and
to understate the November-to-December change. Although this effect
is modest overall--perhaps 25,000--it is most significant for
several series that are particularly sensitive to seasonal hiring,
such as retail trade and amusement services; for these, the net
change from October to December should provide a more reliable
estimate of recent trends.
Although job growth in the private sector from November to
December may have been understated, because of the timing of the
November survey, it was also boosted by the return of 40,000
striking workers to Boeing and Caterpillar payrolls.1 On net,
private employment expanded in December roughly in line with the
average monthly gain during the second half of 1995 of around
120,000. Factory employment edged up 11,000 (strike-adjusted) after
having declined almost 30,000 per month (strike-adjusted) over the
1. Although 10,000 strikers returned to jobs at Caterpillar, we
understand from our industry contact that these rehires are not
intended to represent an expansion of the workforce. The gain in
employment in December will be retraced as replacement workers who
were temporarily employed during the prolonged labor dispute are
laid off.

previous eight months. All of the gains occurred in durable goods
industries, such as lumber, furniture, motor vehicles, fabricated
metals, and electrical equipment; jobs in nondurables, such as
apparel textiles, and chemicals, continued to contract. Elsewhere
in the goods-producing sector employment in contract construction
rose 14,000, despite reports of unfavorable weather, owing to gains
in "indoor" special trades.
Employment in the services industry rose at a relatively
moderate pace; excluding the seasonally sensitive amusement
industry, which lost 44,000 jobs between October and December,
employment in services rose about 100,000 per month in each of the
past two months. Growth remained solid in health, engineering and
management, and computer services, but employment in help supply
services, which had expanded sharply in both 1993 and 1994, was
little changed in December and posted a net gain of only 39,000 for
all of 1995. Elsewhere, employment at retailers was up 34,000, on
net, between October and December, although major job losses
occurred at department stores (-55,000) and apparel and accessory
outlets (-22,000)
In December, average weekly hours dropped to 34.4 hours, the
low end of the range within which this measure has fluctuated since
July 1995 The fall in hours was widespread. Both average weekly
hours and average weekly overtime hours in manufacturing fell
0.1 hour in December, to 41.4 and 4.3 hours respectively. Over the
year, the factory workweek dropped 0.8 hour from its exceptionally
high level at the end of 1994.
The household survey showed the aggregate unemployment rate
holding steady, with employment and unemployment falling 106,000 and
32,000 respectively, Because of the government shutdown, the

somewhat above average--9.2 percent versus a norm of 6.2 percent to
7 2 percent Although the estimates have greater sampling error
than usual, BLS uncovered no signs that the quality of the data was
significantly compromised. Unemployment rates for major demographic
groups were little changed at 4.9 percent for adult men, 4.6 percent
for adult women, and 18.3 percent for teenagers. The labor force
participation rate edged down another 0.1 percentage point, to
66.3 percent, the lowest reading in 1995
Recent data on unemployment insurance claims suggest little
change in labor market conditions between mid-December and mid-
January. The four-week moving average of state initial claims has
fluctuated narrowly since the week ending December 9 between 362,750
and 378,500, and stood at 374,000 for the week ending January 20.
Delayed filings in areas affected by the East Coast storm likely
caused the wide fluctuations in initial claims during the latest two
weeks The number of beneficiaries reported as insured under state
programs was less affected by the weather and, at 2 77 million for
the week ending January 13, was up about 150,000 from its mid-
December level
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in December after
having been unchanged in November On a year-over-year basis, this
wage measure was up 3.2 percent in December compared with its 1994
rise of 2.8 percent. During the second half of 1995, the trend in
average hourly earnings accelerated to a rate somewhat above the
trend in the ECI for wages of nonproduction workers. (The ECI for
December 1995, which was originally scheduled to be released on
January 30, is now scheduled for release on February 13.)

Industrial Production
Industrial production is estimated to have edged up just
0.1 percent in December The end of the strike at Boeing at mid-
month and an increase in motor vehicle assemblies propped up the
December index a bit Excluding these factors, factory output was
lackluster, on balance, at year-end. Production of nondurable
consumer goods and industrial equipment declined last month, and the
expansion of output of information-related products, mainly
semiconductors, slowed.
The factory operating rate dropped to 81.8 percent in December,
about 1/2 percentage point above its long-term average. Since the
beginning of 1995, utilization rates for most major manufacturing
industries have eased, the exception being the industrial machinery
and computer equipment industry. However, utilization in primary
processing industries remained at a relatively high 86.1 percent
rate in the fourth quarter, with operating rates above 1988-89 highs
for primary metals and petroleum products.
After increasing for a second consecutive month in December to
11.9 million units (annual rate) motor vehicle assemblies appear to
have dropped back sharply in January. Weekly production data
through January 26 suggest that assemblies are running at a
10.9 million unit rate, well below plans that stood at 11 7 million
units earlier this month. While a small part of the downshift in
output, about 200,000 units (annual rate) occurred during the
blizzard, the bulk of the change in assemblies was the result of
plant shutdowns later in the month to control inventories, which
2were uncomfortably high at the end of 1995. Our contacts in
2. Part of the December decrease in days' supply, shown in the
table, is due to the use of sales reports that were inflated by
extending the reporting period into January. In this instance, a
more reasonable representation of the industry's inventory position
at year-end is a comparison of end-of-period stocks to average sales
for the quarter

Anecdotal reports and available statistical indicators suggest
that industrial activity outside the motor vehicle sector remained
sluggish in January. The forward-looking orders components of the
national and regional purchasing managers indexes released early in
the month pointed to a further slowing of the manufacturing sector
early this year With four weeks of estimates available for
January, our weekly index of indicators of non-auto physical
product, which covers about a sixth of the IP index, is likely to
edge down; declines in electricity generation, coal paper, lumber,
and appliances appear to be offsetting increases in steel and
petroleum products. Nevertheless, IP in January will be boosted

about 1/4 percentage point by the return to full production at
Boeing.
At this point, we do not believe that the blizzard that struck
the East Coast at mid-month will seriously depress industrial
production for January: Most businesses contacted by staff of the
Board and the five Reserve Banks on the East Coast indicated that
much of any weather-related downtime likely would be made up later
in the month. Important exceptions were motor vehicle producers, as
noted above, and makers of home appliances, televisions, and
lighting and wiring products who do not intend to make up storm-
induced output losses. In addition, and unrelated to the storm,
industry contacts noted the persistence of outsized inventories for
aluminum mill products and coated paper and softer demand for basic
capital goods.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles reportedly surged in December to a
15.9 million unit annual rate, from the 14.8 million unit rate
registered in November The reported increase in total light
vehicle sales last month was overstated by roughly 1/2 million units
because major firms (except Ford) extended their December reporting
periods by one or two days into January; reported January sales will
be held down as a result. Even after adjustment of December sales
for variations in reporting periods, the estimated pace of sales
last month--closer to 15-1/4 million units--was relatively robust.
Consumer incentives helped push up automobile and truck sales of
General Motors, Chrysler, and Japanese models. Sales at Ford, whose
incentives were less generous, fell a bit. Confidential data from
automakers suggest that Ford relied on fleet sales last month to
keep total sales from falling further, while GM experienced gains in
3. The level of production in December retraced only one-fourth
of the cumulative drop during the strike that began last October

both retail and fleet sales. Sales of light vehicles totaled
14.8 million units for all of 1995, compared with 15.0 million units
in 1994.
Producers indicate that underlying demand weakened in January,
mainly for autos rather than light trucks. Many firms are reluctant
to abandon generous incentive packages. Ford has recently joined
the others by offering a package of incentives on about 60 percent
of its volume, including the 1996 Taurus; Chrysler is poised to
sweeten its incentive package on autos to match Ford. The
preliminary report from the January Michigan Survey bear out the
producers' sense that demand has softened. Households' appraisals
of buying conditions for cars plunged after having held in a
reasonably favorable range throughout most of 1995. The survey's
respondents cited less-favorable economic conditions among reasons
for their sour views on car buying. In the December Conference
Board Survey, the percentage of respondents planning to buy a new
car remained unchanged.
Personal Income and Consumption
One notable casualty of the government shutdown is the
availability of timely data on non-auto consumer spending. Real
personal consumption expenditures increased 0.9 percent in November
after a 0.6 percent decline in October, and estimates of total PCE
growth in August and September were revised downward. The level of
total real PCE in November was about 1/2 percent above the third-
quarter average. After two months of decline, spending on durable
goods jumped sharply in November owing to large increases in
spending on both motor vehicles and other durable goods. Real
spending on nondurables, although up in November, was only
fractionally above its third-quarter level However, spending on
services moved noticeably above the recent trend because of the

Anecdotal reports and statistical indicators from private
sources available for December indicate that the strength of holiday
spending varied appreciably among types of goods, with electronic
goods moving well but purchases of apparel sluggish. Reports of
same-store sales at the major retail chains generally pointed to
weak holiday sales, but estimates of total chain store sales
suggested reasonably healthy spending. However, no measure of chain
store sales has proved a very reliable indicator of the official
census estimates of retail sales in the past. These indexes are
plagued by a variety of problems, including data collection errors,
inconsistencies in definitions, and seasonal adjustment
difficulties. In addition, many tend to focus on only certain types
of stores or certain categories of merchandise.
Wages and salaries fell 0.1 percent in November, retracing only
a small part of their enormous October gain and leaving the November
level of real disposable income well above its third-quarter
average. Among sources of nonlabor income, rental income rose
appreciably in October and November after having declined in the
third quarter Most other categories of personal income posted
small to moderate gains in October and November Nominal personal
income likely continued to trend upward in December, with the most
recent employment report indicating further gains in average hourly
earnings that more than offset the decline in aggregate hours,
Altogether, the available evidence on income and spending suggests
that the fourth-quarter saving rate was considerably above its
4.1 percent third-quarter average.

The most recent data on consumer sentiment suggest mixed
prospects for spending. According to the preliminary, partial
sample report, the Michigan SRC index of consumer sentiment declined
1 1 points in early January, with less optimistic appraisals of
future business conditions offsetting more favorable assessments of
current and future personal financial situations and current
appliance-buying conditions. Although the overall Michigan index is
now a few points below its strong readings of the past summer, it
remains in a range that has historically been accompanied by solid
gains in consumer spending. However, results not included in the
overall index pointed to somewhat greater pessimism in early
January, with unemployment expectations jumping sharply and
consumers expressing substantially less willingness to use credit
The SRC identified the winter storms as a possible contributor to
the concerns about joblessness--and the recent news of major
corporate restructurings, especially at AT&T may have affected
public perceptions. The shift in attitudes toward use of credit
could indicate that increased debt burdens--and perhaps the
publicity given them--may have made respondents more sensitive about
credit use; but this series is particularly erratic and several
times in the past few years has registered dramatic declines
followed by sharp recoveries.
The most recent Conference Board data point to a small
deterioration in confidence in December Nonetheless, the level of
the Conference Board index remained in the narrow, generally
optimistic range that has prevailed over the past year. Likewise,
an index based on the separate questions about employment
expectations held at a fairly positive level last month.

Housing Markets
Recent data on housing demand and building activity have been
mixed. Total housing starts rebounded in November to 1.42 million
units at an annual rate, owing to a rise in multifamily
construction. Single-family housing starts were unchanged in
November, but permits, which are measured more reliably than starts,
bounced back to their relatively strong September level. Judging
from historical relationships, this volume of permits suggests that
the estimate of single-family starts may understate the actual trend
in construction activity.
On the other hand, sales of new and existing homes slipped a
bit at the end of last year after having surged in the summer. New
home sales fell in November, and existing home sales fell a
noticeable 3 percent in December. However, because most of the
latter transactions are recorded at closing, they do not really
represent a more current indicator of demand than new home sales,
which are counted primarily at the time the contract is signed.
The basic determinants of housing demand appear to favor
continued strength in home construction. Rates on fixed-rate
mortgages in the first three weeks of January averaged more than
200 basis points lower than in the same period a year earlier, and
our estimate of the debt-service burden of home ownership in the
current quarter is just above the 1993 low. Moreover, the most
recent indicators suggest that, on balance, demand for single-family
homes may have strengthened a bit again in the past two months. In
particular, builders' ratings of new home sales turned more positive
in December and January, and applications for home purchase
financing have been on the rise (apart from storm effects). The
4. According to analysts at the Census Bureau, the processing of
data on starts and permits was completed before the shutdown, making
these estimates fully consistent with earlier observations in the
series.

exception is the decline in consumer assessments of homebuying
conditions in January, as measured by the preliminary Michigan
Survey--extending a downtrend that began in midsummer; less
favorable views of business conditions have played a role in this
slippage.
Multifamily housing starts rose sharply in November However,
a continuation of starts at the November level seems far from
assured. Although the rental vacancy rate has edged down a bit
during the past several years, progress in working down the excess
stock of apartments has been extremely slow, and real rents for
apartments have been stagnant for the past three years.
Business Fixed Investment
As is the case for other economic indicators, the publication
of data relating to business fixed investment is behind schedule.
On net, both the limited data received since the December Greenbook
and anecdotal reports suggest that demand for capital goods-
especially equipment--may have slackened somewhat recently.
In particular, growth of business investment in computers is
expected to slow from the very rapid pace earlier in the expansion,
but still to remain at double-digit rates. Our contacts in the
computer industry were generally disappointed by sales in November
and December, but we believe that some of the earnings squeeze they
experienced may reflect lower margins rather than reduced output
The Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio--which
provides some leading information on computer shipments--also
dropped sharply in November and December, but it remains in a range
that historically has coincided with positive growth in nominal
computer shipments. Given the rapid technical change in this
sector--and accompanying steep price declines--modest growth in

nominal shipments would be consistent with healthy growth in real
outlays.
Business purchases of transportation equipment held up well in
the fourth quarter The confidential information on light-vehicle
fleet sales for GM and Ford showed an increase of roughly 5
percent. Although new orders for heavy trucks plunged, sales in the
fourth quarter were about 5 percent above their third-quarter
average, as producers continued to work on a large backlog of
orders.
Looking ahead, Boeing's bookings surged dramatically in
December, with orders for 52 of their new 777s and for 21 747s;
orders rose further in January. These bookings, which were placed
largely by foreign buyers but include some domestic orders, will
begin to affect deliveries in 1997
Data on contracts received since the December Greenbook suggest
that growth in construction expenditures is dropping back a bit from
the rapid pace in most of 1995. Contracts increased significantly
in November, boosted by healthy advances in the office and
industrial sectors, and this rise roughly offset the October
decline.
Business Inventories
The only incoming statistics on business inventories, outside
of those held by motor vehicle dealers, since the December Greenbook
are the book-value figures for wholesale trade inventories in
November. They show that stocks held by wholesalers were drawn down
at an $11.9 billion annual rate after having risen at a $24.9
billion rate in October; stocks expanded at a $17 billion rate
during the third quarter The bulk of the November decline was in
nondurables, particularly groceries, farm products, and the
miscellaneous category. Among durables, distributors of machinery

also reported a sizable liquidation, but that was more than offset
by a sizable accumulation of stocks at distributors of electrical
goods, which include household appliances.
Federal Sector
The federal unified budget deficit in November was $38
billion.5 This figure brought the total deficit for the first
two months of fiscal year 1996 to $61 billion, a drop of about
$7 billion from the comparable period in fiscal year 1995. Outlays
increased about $2 billion, while receipts grew about $9 billion, or
about 5 percent.
Outlays for the fiscal year through November were up only
slightly from the comparable period of fiscal 1995. Outlays for
Medicare and health continued to rise at about their recent trends.
However, defense outlays continued to decline, and nondefense
outlays other than for major entitlement programs and net interest
fell sharply. These "other" outlays were restrained in part by the
lack of appropriations and the stringent funding levels in the
continuing resolutions. In addition, agricultural spending was held
down by a drop in crop subsidies this year.
BEA estimates that real federal consumption and investment
expenditures (the category that replaces "purchases" in the NIPAs)
declined at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent in the third quarter of
1995, compared with an increase of about 5 percent for purchases in
the advance release. This marked change is largely attributable to
data received over the past several months and the switch to the
chain-type measures of price changes; the redefinition of government
accounts appears to have had a negligible effect. BEA's

revision also contained sizable changes to data for other recent
quarters; nonetheless, on balance, they still show a substantial
decline in real defense spending over the past few years and little
net change in other real consumption and investment expenditures.
The two shutdowns of the government and the January blizzard
are likely to have noticeable effects on real government consumption
and investment expenditures in the NIPA in the fourth and first
quarters. The effect comes primarily in real compensation, which
BEA derives mainly from estimates of hours worked. For the fourth
quarter we estimate that the mid-November furlough and the first
two weeks of the second furlough lowered the level of real
compensation (and thus expenditures) nearly $5-1/2 billion at an
annual rate. For the first quarter the level of real expenditures
was lowered about $1 billion during the last week of the second
furlough and about $2 billion because of the "Blizzard of '96." In
contrast, these developments have little effect on nominal
compensation in the NIPAs: According to BEA's convention, wages are
measured on an accrual basis and the drop in real compensation is
offset by a corresponding rise in the government deflator. For the
unified budget, which measures wages on a disbursement basis, the
second shutdown shifted some payments from December to January but
is expected to have little effect on fiscal year totals.
The Administration and congressional leaders have acknowledged
that prospects for major deficit reduction are slim, but they are
now considering enactment of a package of reductions on which they
previously agreed and a modest tax cut. On January 25, the House
passed a fourth continuing resolution that would fund federal
agencies lacking appropriations through March 15 Detailed cost
estimates for the bill are not yet available, but the implied level
of outlays appears to be broadly similar to that in the previous

II-34
continuing resolution. The Senate will consider the measure on
January 26, and the President is expected to sign it.
State and Local Governments
State and local government employment rose substantially in
December, but this followed two months of essentially no change, and
the average monthly increase for the fourth quarter was only about
10,000. Over 1995 as a whole, employment growth averaged just
14,000 per month, the smallest rise since 1991.
The fiscal position of most states is quite good, and many
would like to cut taxes a bit this year. However, they are being
cautious in light of the uncertainty about federal welfare and
Medicaid reform, the size and structure of other grants programs,
and changes in federal tax laws. Notably, most states appear to be
basing decisions on programs that depend heavily on federal funding
(such as highways, waste treatment, community development, and
educational programs) on the lowest likely level of federal aid.
Moreover, although most states are in good fiscal shape, some
are not. In a survey by the National Conference of State
Legislatures of the fiscal situation as of mid-fiscal year 1996, ten
states reported revenues coming in below projections, compared with
just two states last year. Several states indicated that the
weakness was due to lower-than-expected sales and excise taxes,
while a few blamed smaller personal income tax collections. The
states reporting problems are generally less populous: Idaho,
Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South
Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.
Prices
No data on consumer or producer prices have been released since
the December Greenbook. Commodity market developments have been
mixed and do not indicate that strong inflationary pressures are

II-35
present in the economy. Weather-related tightness in oil and gas
markets could lead to some near-term volatility in energy prices,
but the potential increases do not appear significant enough to push
overall inflation in the next several months to alarming levels.
Turning to prices for industrial commodities, the Journal of
Commerce commodity price index has edged down since the last
Greenbook, owing in part to a fall in the metals component, which is
about 2-1/2 percent lower than in mid-December. The CRB spot index,
which gives substantial weight to foodstuffs, dropped somewhat over
the same period. Prices for aluminum have fallen 6 percent in the
weeks since the December Greenbook, and copper prices have plunged
roughly 15 percent. Large shipments of copper into London Metal
Exchange warehouses appear to have eased traders' fears of a short-
term supply squeeze. Prices for lead and tin have posted modest
declines. The one exception to the general weakness in metals
prices is the price of steel scrap, which has risen about 8 percent
since mid-December; the price of steel scrap is slightly above the
average that prevailed in 1995.
Energy markets have been dominated by the below-normal
temperatures in recent weeks. Weather-induced price increases for
natural gas were magnified by the relatively low levels of working
gas storage and by pipeline constraints; in some parts of the
country, spot wellhead prices in early January were nearly double
the levels observed in the fall. Sharp increases in natural gas
prices spilled over to the petroleum market as some utility power
plants with dual-fuel capabilities switched to the less expensive
residual fuel oil for boiler fuel, boosting petroleum demand.
Prices for home heating oil also rose to new highs in early January.
Stronger-than-expected demand for motor fuels has bolstered gasoline
prices as well.

Prices for crude oil continued to move up in the weeks
following the December Greenbook, and the spot price for WTI crude
broke the $20 per barrel barrier during the recent snowstorms for
the first time since early May. Although the recent oil price
increases were largely weather related, several other factors- the
current low levels of inventories, the illness of Saudi King Fahd,
and the possibility of a U.S. sanction against Nigerian oil
exports--may have intensified price pressures. In recent weeks, oil
prices have dropped somewhat, in part owing to concern that Iraqi
oil might begin flowing into the market soon. The WTI spot price
has retreated to the $18.00 to $19.00 range, a price we believe is
more in line with market fundamentals.
In agriculture, prices of wheat have been running at twenty-
year highs; corn and soybean prices are at the highest level in
several years. U.S. production of major agricultural crops--corn,
wheat, and soybeans--dropped sharply in 1995; corn production was
down about 25 percent, soybean production dropped 15 percent, and
wheat production fell about 6 percent But weak U.S. production is
only part of the story: World production fell last year while
world demand rose, bolstered by rising incomes in the developing
world, Prospective stocks-to-use ratios at the end of the 1995 crop
marketing year--about the time of the 1996 harvest--are at twenty-
year lows, indicating that supplies going into the 1996 crop
marketing year will be tight. The markets are likely to respond
fairly strongly to any news about crop output, as they did in recent
weeks when the South American soybean crop seemed to be headed for
trouble and when the U.S. livestock herd was reported to be bigger
than traders had thought.7
7 Livestock feed is a major source of demand for corn and
soybeans, and a somewhat less important source of demand for wheat

Looking forward, futures contracts for corn and soybeans with
maturities in late 1996 have moved up somewhat since the December
Greenbook. At the same time, futures contracts for livestock have
fallen a little, with futures prices for hogs down sharply in 1996
relative to 1995. However, this favorable development in near-term
prices, if it holds up, will likely lead to higher prices for meats
in 1997 because farmers are likely to respond to lower prices by
liquidating part of the breeding herd.

APPENDIX A
COMPREHENSIVE REVISIONS TO THE NIPA
Overview
On January 19, BEA released a comprehensive revision to the
national income and product accounts. The revision, which covers
data back to 1959, involved: (1) the replacement of constant-dollar
figures with chain-type indexes as the featured measures of real GDP
and its components; (2) the separation of government purchases into
consumption expenditures and investment and a new definition of
government consumption; (3) improved statistical methods for
estimating depreciation, motor vehicle expenditures, and
contributions to private pensions; and (4) the incorporation of more
reliable and comprehensive source data.
The new source data include items generally incorporated only
with comprehensive revisions, most notably the 1987 input-output
tables, the 1991 Residential Finance Survey, and the 1992 economic
censuses. The data for more recent years also were affected by
items that generally are incorporated in the NIPA at the time of the
regular annual revisions, such as IRS tabulations of business tax
returns for 1992 and 1993. Census annual surveys of businesses and
government for 1992, 1993, and 1994, and BLS tabulations of wages
and salaries for 1994.
Revisions to Real GDP Growth
Over the 1960-94 period, growth of real GDP is now estimated to
have averaged 3.2 percent per year, 0.2 percentage point higher than
previously estimated. Revisions to current-dollar GDP had little
net effect on average growth rates (see table). The move from a
fixed-weight to a chain-type formula for real GDP raised average
growth 0.2 percentage point over 1960-94; average growth was boosted
0.3 percentage point before 1988 and was lowered 0.2 percentage
point during 1988-94. By sector, the move to the chain index
had the largest effects on growth in business fixed investment,
exports, and imports, a reflection of the large share of spending on
computers and related items in those sectors.
The cyclical timing of contractions and expansions in real GDP
were little changed by the revision. However, the 1990-91
recession now shows a 2 percent peak-to-trough decline in real
output as opposed to the 1-1/2 percent drop previously estimated
using 1987 dollars. And average growth between the first quarter of
1991 and the third quarter of 1995 is now estimated at 2.5 percent,
0.6 percentage point less than in the previously published 1987-
dollar estimates.
With regard to these most recent years, real GDP growth was
unchanged at 3.7 percent in 1992 but was revised down nearly
1. These effects are calculated as the difference between the
growth rates in constant 1987-dollar GDP and the previously
published chain-weighted GDP index.
2. Two minor changes are the following: (1) The trough in real
GDP during the 1969-70 recession now occurs in the first quarter of
1970 instead of the second quarter of 1970, and (2) the trough in
real GDP during the 1980 recession occurs in the third quarter
instead of the second quarter.

II-A-2
1 percentage point, to 2.2 percent, in 1993 and down 0.6 percentage
point, to 3.5 percent, in 1994. Over the first three quarters of
1995, real GDP growth was revised down 1.3 percentage points, to a
1.4 percent annual rate. The move to chain weighting accounted for
0.8 percentage point of the downward revision to growth in 1993,
0.4 percentage point of the revision in 1994, and 0.9 percentage
point of the lower growth estimate during the first three quarters
of 1995.
Revisions to current-dollar GDP
Annual levels of current-dollar GDP were revised up between
2-1/4 percent and 3-3/4 percent over the revision period. Between
1990 and 1994. the upward revisions averaged about $200 billion.
Definitional and classification changes--as opposed to new source
data--accounted for about 60 percent of these recent revisions and
for an even greater proportion of the changes further back in
history.
Among the components of current-dollar GDP, the largest
revisions occurred in the government sector and for the most part
reflect the definitional change of government consumption to include
the flow of services provided by government-owned structures and
equipment (including military). These flows are set equal to the
estimates of the depreciation of government-owned assets; this
depreciation is now also included in the consumption of fixed
capital for the economy. Accordingly, while the redefinition in
the government accounts results in higher gross domestic product,
the offset in consumption of capital implies that the new system has
no effect on net domestic product.
Personal consumption expenditures also were revised up. Much
of the revision begins to take place in the early 1980s and in large
part reflects the wedging in of new estimates of owner-occupied
housing services based on information from the 1991 Residential
Finance Survey. Spending on nondurables was revised up beginning in
the late 1960s, primarily because of higher spending on restaurant
meals. Outlays for durable goods were revised down starting in
1991, in part because of more accurate measures of average prices
paid for new cars. These revisions to motor vehicle purchases also
reduced outlays for producers' durable equipment, as did new
estimates of spending on communications equipment.
On balance, the revisions to exports and imports were
relatively small. Estimates of current-dollar inventory stocks
generally were revised down somewhat, which, along with the higher
figures for final sales, resulted in a lower level of the inventory-
to-sales ratio. The current-dollar inventory-to-sales ratio moves
in the same general pattern as it did before the revision. However,
the revised ratio of real inventories to real final sales shows less
3. Measuring the service flows from government-owned assets with
the assets' depreciation implicitly assumes that the net rate of
return on these items is zero. BEA recognizes this conceptual
problem. However, they felt their estimates were the best they
could construct for now, especially given the lack of consensus on
the best way to measure the rate of return on government-owned
capital. And, overall, BEA believes that the improvements to the
NIPA from the changes in government accounting more than outweigh
the potential mismeasurement problems arising from the zero net
return assumption.

II-A-3
of a downtrend in the early 1990s and a more noticeable upward
movement in 1994-95 than did the previously published data (chart)
Revisions to the Income Side of the Accounts
A major revision to the income side of the accounts occurred in
the calculation of depreciation of equipment and structures. In
computing equipment and motor vehicles, BEA is now using prices of
used equipment to estimate depreciation. Elsewhere, BEA replaced
their previous straight-line-type depreciation methodology with
geometric--or constant percentage--depreciation. For long-lived
assets, such as housing, the new method tends to lower average
depreciation. For short-lived assets, such as many types of
business equipment, average depreciation is increased.
Because rental income is net of the depreciation of the housing
stock, the new depreciation measures (and the higher estimates for
space rent) boosted rental income significantly. Personal income
also was raised in the 1980s and 1990s by higher estimates of other
labor income, reflecting new estimates of employer contributions to
health insurance and pension plans. BEA also recognized that
their prior estimates had not adequately captured voluntary pre-tax
contributions by employees to thrift savings plans. Revised
estimates of these contributions boosted wage and salary income
beginning in 1979, with the increases tapering off in recent years.
In 1994, however, wages and salaries were revised down significantly
on net, as a result of revised compilations from unemployment
insurance data. With the exception of 1988-90. personal income also
was reduced by lower estimates of nonfarm proprietors' income.
All told, the new estimates of income and outlays resulted in
upward revisions to the personal saving rate of roughly
3/4 percentage point between 1987 and 1991 and 0.4 percentage point
in 1992 and 1993, but they lowered the saving rate by 0.3 percentage
point in 1994 (chart) On balance, the saving rate was not revised
much over the first three quarters of 1995. In contrast, the
increases in depreciation and other revisions lowered economic
profits over the bulk of the revision period (chart)
The changes in government sector accounting also affected the
NIPA definitions of the federal government's and the state and local
governments' surpluses and deficits. These concepts now explicitly
are defined on a current-account basis and are measured by the
difference between receipts and government consumption expenditures,
transfers, net interest, and other current expenditures. Relative
to the previously published deficit calculations, expenditures no
4. Studies of used equipment prices generally find that the
dollar value lost in the first year of operation exceeds the loss
during the second year, the loss in the second year of operation
exceeds that in the third year, and so on. The patterns of these
dollar losses generally are well described by a geometric--or
constant percentage--loss in value.
5. The higher estimates of health insurance contributions come
from revised estimates from the Health Financing Administration.
The new estimates of employer contributions to pension plans largely
result from BEA changing their source of pension contributions from
corporate tax returns to IRS Form 5500.
6. The revisions reflect the changes in depreciation,
incorporation of new tax return data, and updated estimates of tax
compliance.

II-A-4
longer include gross investment, but now include the depreciation of
government-owned capital. The changes were especially large for the
state and local sector, where gross investment generally exceeds
depreciation by a wide margin. After accounting for these and other
revisions, the state and local sector is now estimated to be showing
surpluses (excluding social insurance funds) equal to about
1/2 percent of GDP in recent years; earlier estimates had shown
deficits equal to about 1/2 percent of GDP (chart).
Revisions to Productivity
BLS will be releasing revised productivity figures based on
BEA's new estimates of output. The Board staff estimates that the
revised data will show that the growth of output per hour in the
nonfarm business sector (excluding housing) averaged 1.8 percent
per year during the 1960-94 period, 0.2 percentage point higher than
previously reported in the 1987-dollar-based series. We estimate
that labor productivity growth over 1988-94 will be 0.9 percent at
an annual rate. 0.3 percentage point below the earlier
estimates. On balance, the lower growth reflects the switch
from measuring nonfarm business output from the income side of the
accounts using constant 1987 dollars to measuring output from the
spending side of the accounts using chain-weighted data.
7. These figures are calculated using the currently published
data for hours worked in the nonfarm business sector. The hours
worked data are scheduled to be revised in June.

APPENDIX B
EFFECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
AND EAST COAST BLIZZARD ON DATA QUALITY
Summary
We have been querying the staffs at the Census Bureau and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics concerning the effects of the government
shutdowns and the East Coast snowstorm on the agencies' statistical
releases. Most releases will be published several weeks late
because of delayed surveys and lost processing time. (The attached
table contains the current tentative release schedule.)
The delays ought to allow Census and BLS to process enough data
so that survey coverage and data quality will not be severely
compromised. However, a problem may arise with the CPI, PPI and
housing data: Their monthly percent changes could be distorted
because some source data are being gathered at different times of
the month than they usually are.
Retail Sales
Data on retail sales for November (preliminary) and December
(advance) are scheduled to be released January 30, and the January
advance report is planned for February 28. Both releases are a bit
more than two weeks later in the month than originally scheduled.
Our contact at Census indicated that normal procedures are being
followed and that the data will be in good shape. Indeed, our
contact indicated that the advance data might be a bit better than
usual: Because of the delay in collecting the data. Census should
be able to pick up some late reporters that otherwise would not have
been incorporated until the second estimate.
Business Fixed Investment
The reports on manufacturers' orders and shipments of durable
goods for November and December will be released together on
February 15.
About one-third of the respondents to the M-3 survey provide
their data using touchtone phones, and these responses were
unaffected by the government shutdowns and the snowstorm. The other
respondents fill in surveys mailed to them by the Census Bureau.
The November survey was mailed on time, and Census feels the month-
and-a-half delay in publication will enable them to process
sufficient information to allow the November report to be the
"final" data for the month. The December survey was mailed January
11, about two weeks later than normal. Census feels the three-week
delay in publication of these data will enable them to process about
as many responses as they usually do for a "preliminary" report,
Data on construction put-in-place for November and December
also will be published together on February 15. These data are
based on surveys of builders. Construction permits for November are
scheduled to be released January 25, and permits for December likely
1 Our contact indicated that a report in the Washington Post
suggesting that Census lacked retail sales data for December was
incorrect
II-B-1

II-B-2
will follow about two weeks after that. These data are based on
surveys of permit-issuing offices. The November surveys for both
construction-put-in-place and permits were mailed on their normal
schedule, but the December questionnaires went out about two weeks
late.
Inventories
Manufacturing inventories for November and December will be
released on February 15 in conjunction with the manufacturers'
orders and shipments data. The wholesale inventory data for
November were released on January 26, and the retail inventory data
for November are scheduled to be published during the week of
February 12. Trade sector inventory data are collected in the same
surveys as those that gather the monthly sales data. Our
contacts did not anticipate any problems affecting data quality.
Although the November retail surveys were mailed late, the
publication delay ought to allow Census to maintain at least the
usual survey coverage; in fact, our contacts felt the delays might
result in improved response rates. However, our contacts indicated
that they are far enough behind in processing data that the
wholesale and retail reports for December, January, and possibly
February also will be delayed.
Housing
Housing starts and permits for both December and January are
scheduled to be released on February 23.
The principal housing data stem from field samples of permit
offices (in permit-issuing places) and of housing starts (in non-
permit areas) by the Census Bureau. These surveys were delayed in
January by the government shutdown. Furthermore, the snowstorm may
have prevented some site visits in non-permit-issuing areas. The
storm also may have blocked some site interviews in permit-issuing
places that are used to augment the regular telephone follow-ups
that identify when construction on units with permits is started and
when units for sale are sold.
These delays and the missed sampling can cause a variety of
problems. First, smaller samples increase statistical noise.
Second, some permit offices have very poor recordkeeping, and our
Census contacts are concerned that the delays may make it more
difficult than usual to correctly allocate permits from these
offices between December and January. Finally, Census uses the
reported permit and start data to impute values for late responses
and for starts that occur before permit issuance. Similar
imputations are made for sales of units that occur before permit
issuance. When sampling is delayed--as it was in January--Census
may receive more responses than usual, so that automatic application
of the regular imputation factors would result in an overestimate of
starts and sales. Census does not plan to change its imputation
methods to account for this possibility.
2. In retailing, this survey is the one that also produces the
preliminary retail sales report. Response rates for inventories
generally are not as high as those for sales, however.

II-B-3
International Trade
The international trade data for November, originally scheduled
for publication on January 19, are now scheduled to be released the
week of February 5. Customs agents were at work during both
government shutdowns, and all import and export documents were
collected as usual Pushing back the publication date will allow
for full compilation of all statistics (including late reporters)
with no reduction in data quality.
Prices
The December PPI will be released on January 31 and the
December CPI on February 1; these publication dates are about two
weeks later than usual. The January PPI is scheduled for release,
as originally scheduled, on February 14, but the January CPI likely
will be delayed about two weeks, to February 28.
Our CPI contact at BLS estimated that the number of price
quotes incorporated in the December CPI will have been only about
2 percent less than the number used in last December's index. Our
contact would not venture a guess on what the sample coverage would
be in the January index. To get as large a sample as possible, BLS
is allowing more than the usual amount of telephone interviewing in
place of on-site data collection when needed--for example, when snow
prevented site visits. Still, smaller sample sizes could increase
the statistical noise in the CPI.
The CPI also will be affected by changes in the timing of data
collection. In anticipation of the government shutdown, BLS
accelerated its data collection last month; in contrast, the
shutdown is delaying data collection in January. All else
equal, these timing perturbations will trim the monthly percent
change in the CPI in December and February but boost the change in
January; however, given underlying inflation rates, the Board staff
estimates that the distortions ought to be less than 0.1 percentage
point per month. BLS will not make any statistical adjustments to
account for the timing problems, but it plans to include an
explanation of the procedural changes in the CPI press release.
Our PPI contact did not see any problems with the quality of
the December data: The forms went out on the usual schedule, and
since then, responses have "just been piling up in the mail room."
Some problems may occur in January, however. Normally, the forms
would have been in respondents' hands by the January 9 pricing date
for the PPI; instead the forms were mailed out between January 11
and January 19. This delay means that prices for the 9th will be
based on memory, which risks errors in recall or the substitution of
prices from later in the month. On the other hand, BLS does not
expect any sample attrition due to the late mailings or the
snowstorm.
3 Ordinarily, the CPI price quotes for January through October
are collected during the first eighteen working days of the month;
due to the extra holidays, data for November and December usually
are collected during the first fifteen working days of the month.
After accounting for weekends and holidays, without the shutdown,
last month's price quotes would have been collected by December 21
and this month's data would be in by January 26. Instead, the
December data probably were collected by the 15th, and the January
price quotes will be gathered between the 8th and the 31st.

II-B-4
Labor Markets
As noted in the labor market section, the government shutdown
prevented BLS from providing its usual revisions to the November
establishment survey. As a result, the levels of employment, hours,
and earnings in November and December may contain more statistical
noise than usual. The December establishment survey data were
transmitted late to the BLS by the state offices. This delay
resulted in larger-than-usual response rates, which may have
improved the estimates of the change in employment between November
and December. On the other hand, the survey may have been affected
by the compressed time available to process the data by BLS staff.
Indeed, Board staff observed some anomalies in the four-digit SIC
manufacturing data used in the construction of the industrial
production index, and we are concerned that similar aberrations may
exist in the data outside of manufacturing.
The January establishment survey also was collected late, but
the follow-ups are on schedule. With short time, the process used
to review revisions to data in December will be slightly less
complete than usual. Otherwise, in the absence of another shutdown,
processing should proceed according to normal procedures. The
January labor market report is scheduled to be released on
February 2, its regular publication date.
The December household survey was collected according to the
usual schedule, and the follow-ups were completed on time. Although
the response rate was lower than usual, BLS considers the sample
coverage to be adequate. However, the introduction of new
seasonal factors, which usually takes place in December, has been
postponed. The January household survey is being conducted this
week according to the regular schedule.
The employment cost index for the fourth quarter will be
delayed from January 30 to February 13. However, because the data
are drawn from permanent payroll records, data quality should be
unaffected.
4. Because the data are based on permanent payroll records, BLS
does not expect the late transmission to result in response errors
such as those that might plague the PPI.
5. The household survey was collected during the week of December
5, but BLS ordinarily collects the December household survey a week
early to avoid reporting problems around the holidays. Still, the
response rate to the December survey was somewhat lower than usual;
responses were unavailable from 9.2 percent of the households in the
CPS sample, as compared with the 6.2 percent to 7.2 percent
nonresponse rate usually experienced.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most market interest rates declined slightly in the wake of the
System's announcement at the close of the December FOMC meeting of a
25 basis point easing in the intended federal funds rate. Major
commercial banks followed the System's action by lowering the prime
rate a quarter point to 8-1/2 percent.
After this initial reaction, interest rates have fluctuated
widely in response to incoming news about the economy and the
federal budget On balance, market participants seem to anticipate
at least a near-term dose of federal expenditure restraint and have
interpreted incoming data as suggesting only modest economic growth.
Consequently, they have built in greater likelihood for a further
easing in System policy, and interest rates have declined somewhat.
Treasury note and bond yields are currently down about 10 basis
points to 30 basis points. Interest rate declines have helped
bolster stock prices; major equity indexes are up about 2 percent to
3-1/2 percent from their levels at the time of the December FOMC
meeting.
Gross public issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations
dropped off in late December but has bounced back in January With
long-term interest rates remaining close to their recent lows,
corporations have continued to favor longer-term financing. In the
household sector survey data on loan applications point to a pickup
in home mortgage borrowing; however growth of consumer credit in
November was somewhat less robust than in earlier months. In the
state and local sector, the volume of outstanding tax-exempt bonds
contracted about $11 billion in the fourth quarter Federal
borrowing was relatively weak last quarter: spending was constrained

Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit1
The growth rates of the broad monetary aggregates picked up in
December but they remained below the levels posted in the spring.
M2 expanded at about a 5-3/4 percent annual pace in December, buoyed
by strong growth in savings deposits (table) 2 Part of the surge
in savings deposits reflected a shift of funds from OCDs (other
checkable deposits) resulting from new sweep programs at nine
additional bank holding companies. Still adjusted for sweeps,
savings deposits grew at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate. Growth of
retail money market funds remained strong in December as the spread
of rates on money market instruments over those on money funds
narrowed, and the continued flatness of the yield curve provided
little incentive for investors to turn to longer maturity
instruments. Growth in M2 appears to have increased a bit further
in January.
M1 fell at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in December, as the OCD
sweep programs cut 10 percentage points from the growth rate of this
aggregate. The decline in OCDs offset increased strength in other
M1 components. Demand deposits grew at a 5 percent pace, boosted in
part by an increase in mortgage refinancings (associated prepayments
of securitized mortgages are temporarily held in liquid deposits)
1 The monetary data in the Greenbook incorporate new benchmarks
and seasonal adjustments. In addition, the M2 data reflect a minor
revision of the definition of the aggregate, which involves a shift
of overnight Eurodollars and overnight wholesale RPs from M2 to non-
M2 M3. These data are scheduled to be published in mid-February and
are strictly confidential until that time.
2. On a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, M2 expanded
4-1/4 percent during 1995, using either the old or the new
definition

Currency growth also has picked up in recent months, after slow
expansion in the summer and early fall
M3 expanded slightly more than 6 percent during 1995, just
above the upper limit of its annual growth cone Growth was more
modest last month, however, at about a 4-1/4 percent annual pace,
reflecting a drop in its non-M2 components. Growth of large time
deposits slowed further largely because of a drop at agencies and
branches of foreign banks, whose assets continued contracting in
December M3 in January appears to have accelerated, boosted by
strong inflows to institution-only money funds. Large time deposits
also appear to have picked up, and RPs have turned around.
Bank credit expanded quite sluggishly in December for the third
consecutive month (table) Securities holdings increased, but the
gains were the result of revaluations rather than purchases.
Indeed banks sold securities on net likely reflecting in part a
temporary easing of the accounting rules regarding sales of
securities categorized as held-to-maturity.3 Weakness in all
major categories reduced loan growth in December to a sluggish
1-1/4 percent annual pace. Growth of business loans late last year
likely was held down in part by some substitution toward capital
market financing by nonfinancial businesses Nonetheless,
preliminary data for January suggest that business loan growth has
strengthened noticeably, Growth of real estate loans also appears
to have picked up in early January after having fallen at a
3 percent annual rate in December; the strength in January is
largely attributable to bank acquisitions of thrifts.
3. The Financial Accounting Standards Board allowed banks to make
a one-time reallocation of their investment account securities from
the held-to-maturity classification to the available-for-sale
category between November 15 and December 31 1995

III-6
In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks
indicated no change, on net, in standards for approving home
mortgages and a slight increase in demand for these loans.
Nevertheless, a third of the domestic respondents indicated they had
experienced a slowdown in recent months in the growth of residential
mortgages on their books. Banks indicating such a slowdown placed
equal importance on reduced originations--reflecting partly a
seasonally weaker housing market--and increased securitization of
real estate loans as reasons for the slowing.
Despite some market fears that declining asset quality could
constrain bank profitability, earnings at large bank holding
companies were strong last quarter. Bank profits were buoyed by
loan growth, reduced deposit insurance premiums, and industry
efforts to cut costs. The increase in loans helped support net
interest margins last year, as banks shifted their portfolios away
from securities, which generally carry lower yields. Although
margins at the large holding companies narrowed some from the year-
earlier quarter, average margins remained high by historical
standards. Trading results were mixed but evidently improved on
balance. On the down side, provisions for loan losses and charge-
offs of nonperforming loans increased at many banks, but the rises
were generally modest.
Mutual Funds
Net sales of long-term mutual funds increased in November and
December, largely reflecting continued strong inflows into equity
funds (table). Investor demand for domestic equity funds held firm,
and interest in international equity funds picked up. Although a
sizable portion of the recent inflows is attributable to reinvested
distributions, mutual fund complexes report that net new sales of
stock funds also remained strong, despite the potential tax

III-7
liability from capital gains distributions. Spurred by the highest
total returns since 1991, net sales of stock funds for all of 1995
totaled a record $144 billion, surpassing the previous high reached
in 1993. Preliminary data indicate that stock fund inflows remained
heavy through mid-January.

Income and high-yield bond funds accounted for virtually all of
the net sales of bond funds last year, and they continued to post
inflows in December and early January. Funds in the income category
contain some equity exposure, which partly accounts for the strong
investor interest in such funds. For the past year as a whole, bond
funds registered positive net sales, reversing the outflows in 1994
but falling far short of the record pace in 1993.1995

III-9
Business Finance
Gross public bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations were
light in the second half of December, reflecting the seasonal
slowdown in activity around the holidays (table). This lull
followed a spurt of issuance during the fall, when companies took
advantage of the decline in bond rates to lock in favorable long-
term funding and to repay short-term debt. The incentive to pursue
this strategy remains strong, and the pace of offerings has picked
up in recent weeks; moreover, the calendar of prospective issues is
quite heavy.
Credit quality in the nonfinancial corporate sector appears to
remain strong although there are a few signs of deterioration.
Interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and high-yield bonds
have crept up since early 1995, but they remain relatively low by
historical standards (chart, upper panels). The default rate on
high-yield bonds increased in 1995 to 2.7 percent of face value, but
that rate is below the average over the past decade (chart, lower
left panel). Balance sheets at nonfinancial corporations appear to
remain healthy on the whole; interest-coverage ratios and debt-to-
asset ratios remain in good condition. In addition, 1995 was the
first year since the mid-1980s in which the value of debt upgraded
exceeded the value downgraded (chart, lower right panel). That
said, rating changes in the fourth quarter alone were not as
favorable as those earlier in the year, as Moody's upgraded only
$15 billion of nonfinancial debt while downgrading $27 billion.
Moreover, banks reported some small move toward tighter underwriting
standards for business loans in the January Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey, owing to concerns about the economy. [See the
appendix for a more detailed discussion of the survey results.]

Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms slowed in December
from the fast pace in October and November. Issuance during the
first half of January also was modest, likely reflecting the
slowdown that typically occurs as underwriters wait to obtain year-
end financial data from prospective issuers. The pace of issuance
has picked up some of late, and market sources anticipate a
substantial flow of offerings in the near term.
The numerous stock repurchase programs under way, along with
share retirements through mergers, have continued to overwhelm gross
equity issuance. Nonfinancial corporations announced repurchase
programs totaling nearly $70 billion in 1995, with $19 billion of
planned repurchases announced during the fourth quarter alone
(chart, upper panel). Repurchases have been concentrated among
successful industrial companies whose profits continue to exceed
their needs for cash. Indeed, in the fourth quarter, just four
companies together accounted for about one-third of the announced
repurchase volume.
Merger-related stock retirements have also continued to be
substantial (chart, lower panel). In 1995, megamergers (deals in
which the target's equity is valued at $1 billion or more) resulted
in equity retirements at nonfinancial firms totaling almost
$55 billion. (All told, megamergers accounted for about 60 percent
of merger-related equity retirements last year.) Another $2 billion
in equity was retired during the first weeks of 1996, and recently
proposed megamergers would retire another $25 billion in equity.
Most of the recent deals have not sparked concerns about a slippage
in credit quality, reflecting both the limited amount of debt
financing and the potential for increased profits at the newly
combined firms. Of approximately $100 billion in completed
megamergers last year, more than two-thirds of the combinations

occurred in just three industries that are undergoing structural
change--telecommunications and media, health care and
pharmaceuticals, and defense.
Most broad indexes of stock prices have risen 2 percent to
3-1/2 percent on net from their levels just before the December FOMC
meeting, boosted by the decline in long-term interest rates (chart,
top panel). Stock prices sagged temporarily because of worries
about the strength of corporate earnings. A number of companies,
mostly in the computer sector, warned analysts that earnings were
likely to be disappointing, and the warnings prompted some analysts
to revise down their estimates of fourth-quarter earnings ahead of
the formal announcements. However, on balance, earnings reports to
date have come in somewhat above the revised forecasts. Notable
positive surprises include IBM, Intel, and Microsoft; the latter two
helped the Nasdaq computer index to retrace part of its sharp
decline around year-end (chart, lower panel).
Treasury and Agency Financing
The staff expects the federal budget deficit to total close to
$100 billion in the first quarter. The Treasury is expected to
finance the shortfall by borrowing a roughly equivalent amount in
the market, raising about one quarter of the amount in coupon
auctions and the remainder in bills. The Treasury announced
reductions in the sizes of its weekly bill auctions for the third
and fourth weeks of January to make room under the debt ceiling for
the two-year and five-year notes that settle January 31. However,
the staff expects that the Treasury will need to raise weekly bill
auction sizes by quarter-end to make up for the earlier paydown. In
addition, the Treasury is expected to auction a sizable amount of
cash management bills. The staff's assumptions for Treasury

III-15
financing are contingent upon some resolution of the debt ceiling
problem.
On January 22, Secretary Rubin notified the Congress that the
Treasury would take further steps to make room under the current
$4.9 trillion debt ceiling. These steps include replacing
securities that are subject to the limit and currently held in the
Exchange Stabilization Fund (about $4 billion) with obligations that
are not subject to the limit. Additionally, about $9 billion of
securities of the Federal Financing Bank will replace Treasury
obligations held by various government trust funds. The Secretary
also made the determination that the debt ceiling problem will last
somewhat longer than was projected in mid-November, which permits
him to disinvest an additional $6-1/2 billion of Treasury debt held
by the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. All told,
these actions lower debt outstanding subject to limit
$19-1/2 billion, making room for a like amount of issuance of
marketable debt.
The Treasury's need to borrow in the first quarter, however,
outstrips this additional scope for borrowing. Absent further
steps, which Secretary Rubin has told the Congress are of
questionable legality, or an increase in the debt ceiling, the
Treasury has indicated that it will likely deplete its cash balances
and exhaust room under the current debt ceiling at the end of
February or early March. It appears that the markets are expecting
that the debt ceiling will be raised or that the Treasury will turn
to other measures to avoid default, as Treasury prices do not appear
to contain a default premium.
Debt issuance by federal agencies appears to have increased in
early January from the moderate pace of the latter half of 1995.
Much of the new debt is intended to refinance securities that have

II1-16
been called. New issues have been primarily noncallable debentures,
including the first-ever noncallable bond offering by the Tennessee
Valley Authority, but offerings of callable debt remain sizable.
Despite the pickup in issuance, spreads in the primary market for
noncallable debentures have remained stable.

State and Local Government Finance
Low long-term interest rates continued to boost gross offerings
of municipal securities in December (table). For the fourth quarter
as a whole, both new capital issuance and refundings were at the
highest quarterly levels in roughly two years. Market activity was
slow in early January, consistent with the usual seasonal pattern,
but issuance has picked up of late.
Gross issuance of tax-exempt bonds over all of 1995, was down
slightly from its 1994 level. In contrast, retirements increased
last year, as a large volume of advance-refunded debt became
eligible to be called. With the bulge in retirements, outstanding
long-term debt is estimated to have fallen more than $50 billion in

III-17
1995. The downtrend in outstandings will probably persist for some
time, as a considerable amount of pre-refunded debt has not yet been
retired. Market analysts expect that gross debt retirements this
year will again outpace gross offerings, with the range of estimates
centering on a decline in outstanding debt of about $30 billion.

Recent declines in municipal bond yields have about matched
those on Treasuries, leaving the long-term tax-exempt to taxable
ratio little changed from the elevated level that generally has
prevailed since last spring. In contrast, the one-year yield ratio
has increased quite a bit since early December and now hovers around
0.71, compared with a low of 0.62 reached last fall. Trade reports
indicate that most of this increase reflects concerns over the
Administration's budget proposal to eliminate a tax advantage for
corporations that typically buy short-term tax-exempt debt. If
the proposal is enacted, many corporations will reduce their demand
4. The Administration would eliminate a rule that currently
allows corporations to deduct interest expenses on funds borrowed to
buy tax-exempt paper as long as their holdings of municipals are no
more than 2 percent of total assets.

III-18
for short-term paper, much as the 1986 tax reform reduced commercial
bank demand for municipal debt.
Credit spreads on long-term municipal bonds have changed little
on balance since the beginning of 1995. The spread between the
Baa-rated general obligation bond and a comparable AAA-rated bond
stood at about 60 basis points in mid-January, about the same as in
December.
Mortgage Markets
Interest rates on home mortgages declined on net over the
intermeeting period. The average contract rate on conventional
thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped roughly 15 basis points,
while the average initial rate on adjustable-rate mortgages indexed
to the one-year Treasury constant maturity yield declined about
18 basis points. The FRM-ARM initial rate spread remains near its
lowest level since August 1990 (chart, upper panel).
The flatness in the mortgage yield curve and the low absolute
level of FRM rates have contributed to a sizable FRM share of
conventional mortgage originations. The Federal Housing Finance
Board reported last month that the FRM share climbed to 81 percent
in November, the highest since November 1993. Signs that homebuyers
may be responding to lower rates are evident in the Mortgage Bankers
Association's (MBA) index of applications for loans to purchase new
and existing homes. Apart from a weather-related drop in mid-
January, the MBA's purchase index (seasonally adjusted by Board
staff) has fluctuated over much of the intermeeting period at the
highest levels in its six-year history (chart). Refinancing
activity also appears to have increased, but it remains well below
the record levels reached in 1993.
In secondary mortgage markets, gross issuance of agency-backed
pass-through securities is estimated to have increased further in

December boosting total offerings in the fourth quarter to the
highest quarterly figure in more than a year. Still gross issuance
remained well below the average quarterly pace of $142 billion in
1993. For 1995 as a whole, gross issuance of agency pass-throughs
totaled $269 billion, owing largely to the historically low volumes
registered in the first two quarters of the year Issuance of
agency-backed CMO (collateralized mortgage obligation) and REMIC
(real estate mortgage investment conduit) securities totaled
$23 billion last year, just a fraction of the roughly $120 billion
issued in 1994
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit outstanding grew at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 10-1/2 percent in November down from
13-3/4 percent in October (table) While fluctuating from month to
month, growth of consumer credit appears to have slowed noticeably
since earlier in 1995 This slowing reflects a sharp deceleration
in revolving credit from rates above 20 percent earlier in the year
to under 12 percent in the second half Some drop-off in revolving
credit was expected, given rising debt burdens and softness in
retail sales. Auto credit in contrast grew a bit more rapidly in
recent months than earlier last year as manufacturers' incentives
(lower financing rates and rebates) apparently induced some
consumers to switch from leasing to outright purchase of autos, The
January survey of loan officers indicated that banks, on net, have
not changed the terms on auto loans or credit cards over recent
months. But some respondents reportedly had tightened standards for
approving such loans (appendix)
Interest rates on new cars and personal loans at commercial
banks were unchanged between August and November while the average
new-car rate at "captive" finance companies edged down slightly.

Over the full year, loan rates declined much less than did yields on
Treasury securities of comparable maturities, so rate spreads rose
substantially from very low levels to above-average levels (chart).
Still, new-car loan rates, at about 9-1/2 percent at banks, are in a
historically low range, at least in nominal terms. From 1972, when
the series began, until 1993, rates had never broken below
10 percent.
Preliminary data suggest that securitization of consumer loans
continued apace in the final quarter of 1995. Fourth-quarter
issuance of credit card, auto, and "other" asset-backed securities
is estimated at about $25 billion, bringing the total for the past
year as a whole to $81 billion--well above the previous record total
of $51 billion in 1994.
Despite statistical and anecdotal evidence of rising
delinquency rates for credit card accounts, investors do not appear
greatly concerned about the risk of holding such securities.
Rate spreads on credit-card-backed securities were at historically
low levels late last year (chart), notwithstanding a large volume of
supply. The current market reaction is in contrast to that in 1991,
when rising delinquency rates contributed to a steep rise in rate
spreads.
Several factors may help explain the market's limited concern
about credit quality. One is that although credit card
delinquencies have risen considerably in anecdotal reports and some
statistical measures, Moody's delinquency rate series on securitized
credit card receivables was quite low in October (latest available
reading), although up a little from its lowest point (chart).
5. The only securities currently of concern seem to be those
associated with certain troubled specialty retailers, which account
for only about $1 billion of a nearly $130 billion market.

Also, experience in the 1990-91 recession, when virtually every
credit-card-backed security survived without a mishap, may have made
investors more comfortable with holding such securities when
delinquency rates are rising. Moreover by comparison with some
other possible investment vehicles, card-backed securities may look
quite attractive. Investor disaffection with CMOs, for instance,
after several well-publicized cases of large investment losses in
1994, is likely boosting demand for card-backed securities. Demand
by foreign investors reportedly has been particularly strong.

APPENDIX
THE JANUARY SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON
BANK LENDING PRACTICES
The January 1996 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices posed questions about changes in bank lending
standards and terms, changes in loan demand by businesses and
households, the recent weakness in home mortgage lending, and the
response of the banks to a temporary opportunity to reclassify their
investment account securities. Fifty-eight domestic commercial
banks and twenty-two U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
participated in the survey.
The survey results are consistent with a slight firming of
credit standards over the past three months. Small net fractions of
banks indicated that they had tightened lending standards for
commercial and industrial firms of all sizes. Standards for
commercial real estate loans were also tightened, while standards on
home mortgage loans were unchanged, on net. In response to new
questions, banks indicated that they had tightened standards for
credit card accounts and auto lending, even though they indicated a
slightly increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.
While standards for most types of loans firmed a bit, a few
banks indicated that they had eased some loan terms. Banks eased
terms on business loans slightly, on net, although the shares that
reported having done so were the smallest in several years. There
was little change in terms on credit card debt or auto loans.
The change in demand for credit over the past three months was
mixed across loan types. Banks reported that demand for business
loans from large and middle-market firms was little changed, on net,
but demand from small businesses had increased. Banks also reported
increased demand for commercial and residential real estate loans.
Demand for consumer installment loans weakened, however.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
The January survey found a modest tightening of standards for
approving business loans other than for mergers over the past three
months. Between 5 and 10 percent of domestic and foreign banks
indicated that they had tightened standards for loans to large,
middle-market, and small businesses. This is the first survey to
report a net tightening of standards on business loans in the past 3
years.
Significant fractions of banks reported an easing of terms on
these loans. A quarter of the domestic respondents reported a
decrease in the spreads of loan rates over market rates for loans to
large and middle-market firms, while fewer than 10 percent reported
a decrease in spreads on loans to small businesses. As has been the
case for some time, smaller fractions of respondents eased other
terms, including the cost of credit lines, the size of credit lines,
loan covenants, and collateralization requirements. The pace at
which banks are easing terms appears to be slowing: This is the
third consecutive survey in which the share of banks reporting
easier terms has fallen. Indeed, for collateralization requirements
for small and middle-market borrowers, more banks tightened than
III-A-1

III-A-2
eased standards, the first such net tightening since 1993. Foreign
branches and agencies indicated no change, on net, in terms.
Those banks that tightened their lending standards or terms on
business loans attributed this foremost to a less favorable economic
outlook. Those that eased standards or terms did so because of
increased competition from other banks and, to a lesser extent, from
nonbank lenders.
Banks reported little change in demand for loans from large and
middle-market firms, but an increase in demand from small
businesses. Many of the banks that experienced an increase or
decrease in demand for business loans attributed it, in part, to
changes in the financing needs of their customers for inventory and
equipment investment. However, banks that experienced increased
demand from large firms attributed much of the increase to merger
and acquisition financing.
Commercial Real Estate
Small fractions of both domestic and foreign respondents
reported tightening standards on loans for commercial offices and
for industrial structures, while about 20 percent indicated they had
tightened standards on construction and land development loans and
on other nonfarm nonresidential real estate loans. On balance,
standards for commercial real estate loans were tightened by a net
share of banks that was larger than at any time since the beginning
of 1992. Demand for these loans likely increased over the past
three months, as a few more banks indicated an increase than a
decrease in demand for commercial real estate loans. However, the
net share of banks reporting an increase in demand was below the
levels reported since May, when this question was added to the
survey.
Lending to Households
About a quarter of the banks, on net, indicated they had
tightened standards over the past three months for approving new
credit card accounts, and a sixth tightened standards on auto loans.
Banks attributed the tightening to many factors including, in
decreasing order of importance, increased delinquency rates, an
increased willingness of households to declare bankruptcy, increased
household debt burdens, and a less favorable economic outlook. On
net, about 5 percent of banks indicated a greater willingness to
make consumer installment loans. Although this result seems at odds
with the tightening of standards reported for these loans, the
fraction of banks reporting increased willingness, while up slightly
from last quarter, remains relatively low. Terms on credit card
loans were little changed: A couple of banks reduced credit limits,
but a similar number reduced spreads over market rates and reduced
the minimum fraction of outstanding balances required to be repaid
each month. Banks reported essentially no change in terms on auto
loans. On net, respondents reported a small decline in demand for
consumer installment loans.
Banks indicated no change in standards for approving home
mortgages, and about 15 percent, on net, experienced an increase in
demand for these loans. A series of special questions explored the
reasons for the recent slowing of the growth in real estate loans on
banks' books. A third of the domestic respondents indicated they
had experienced such a slowdown. Those banks that had encountered a

III-A-3
slowdown attributed it to an increased rate at which they were
securitizing these loans, reduced loan originations, and increased
repayments of loans refinanced elsewhere. Respondents attributed
the increased rate of securitization to demand from households for
fixed rate mortgages, which are more likely to be securitized, and
to a need for funds by their bank. They attributed the slowdown in
originations of these loans to a weaker housing market in their
region.
Investment Account Securities
Several questions asked the domestic and foreign respondents
about the recent SFAS 115 reassessment, which allowed banks to
reallocate, on one occasion between November 15 and December 31
1995, their investment account securities between "available for
sale" and "held to maturity" without penalty. A large
proportion of the domestic respondents reported a substantial shift
of securities into the available-for-sale category. Three-quarters
of the respondents indicated that the resulting shift increased the
share of their investment account securities that are available for
sale by 20 percentage points or more. In most cases the banks held,
rather than immediately sold, the securities that were reclassified.
Those banks that reclassified securities did so because of a desire
for increased liquidity and flexibility and also because gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities are not reflected in equity
for regulatory purposes.
1 The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 115 requires banks, effective January
1 1994, to classify securities held outside of trading accounts as
"available for sale" or "held to maturity." The former are marked
to market while the latter are evaluated at amortized cost. Those
securities classified as held to maturity cannot be sold without
penalty.
2. The decision to exclude these gains and losses from regulatory
capital was announced after banks were required to declare which
securities in their portfolio would be held to maturity

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
The deficit for U.S. international trade in goods and services
was $8.0 billion in October, slightly smaller than in the previous
two months, and less than averages recorded in the second and third
quarters. Imports declined a bit more in October than exports
declined. The 1 percent decrease in imports was largely in oil
(especially quantity) and automotive products. Computer imports,
however, recorded another strong rise. For exports, a drop in
agricultural and automotive shipments from relatively strong levels
was partly offset by an increase to record levels in machinery
exports. Data for November are now scheduled to be released during
the week of February 5.

In the third quarter, the deficit was significantly less than
in the second quarter. Exports of goods and services rose 1 percent
with increases recorded in most major categories of trade. Imports
declined 1 percent, with most of the decrease occurring in
categories of trade that had increased sharply in the second
quarter.

imported in October was less than in any month since last April.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that in
November imports should move back up reflecting a build-up in oil
inventories.
The price of imported oil increased slightly in November after
declining in October. The general decline in prices from May
through October reflected concern in world spot markets about an
over-abundant world oil supply. In November, prices increased
because of loss of output in Mexico from late hurricanes, fear of
oil workers' strikes in Venezuela and Brazil, and the decision by
OPEC to maintain existing production quotas. Spot WTI prices rose
sharply in December (by over $1.00 per barrel to average $18.77 per
barrel) because of colder than normal weather in North America,
Japan, and Europe, and uncertainty about Saudi Arabian oil policies
given the poor health of King Fahd. Spot WTI rose above $20.00 per
barrel in early January as the cold weather persisted and King Fahd
temporarily turned over power to Crown Prince Abdullah. Spot WTI
fell back below $18.00 per barrel when Iraq requested a reopening of
negotiations with the United Nations for a limited sale of oil, and
when the temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere appeared to be
returning to normal.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports increased slightly in November
after falling during the previous two months. Increases in prices
of imported capital goods and foods (both following two months of
sizable declines) were partly offset by a drop in the price of
imported industrial supplies (primarily metals and selected building
supplies).
For October-November combined, compared with the third
quarter, prices of non-oil imports declined 1-1/2 percent at an

annual rate; this follows 10 consecutive quarters of price
increases. The largest declines were in capital goods and foods.
Prices of imported industrial supplies were little changed on
average.
Prices of exports decreased slightly in November following two
months of very small increases. The decline was attributable to a
drop (for the sixth consecutive month) in prices of exported
industrial supplies. As in the preceding two months, prices of
agricultural exports rose strongly (especially grains).
For October-November combined, compared with the third
quarter, prices of nonagricultural exports declined and prices of
agricultural exports increased sharply. As was the case in the
third quarter, prices of nonagricultural exports declined as prices
of exported industrial supplies dropped sharply following double-
digit increases from mid-1994 through mid-1995. Quarterly prices of

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities rebounded
strongly in November, to resume the heady pace set earlier in the
year (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions
table). Private security purchases were dampened in October by
large sales of Treasuries in the United Kingdom and Japan, which
totaled more than $14 billion. In November these countries recorded
purchases of almost $2 billion. In both months the offshore centers
associated with U.S.-based hedge funds recorded large purchases of
Treasuries--in the $15 billion range. This pattern is broadly
consistent with press reports stating that foreigners less closely
associated with the U.S. markets were particularly concerned about

the possibility that the U.S. Treasury might not meet its mid-
November obligations.
Foreign net purchases of corporate and agency bonds also
picked up in November, after a modest slowing in October (line 4b).
Nearly all of the net purchases were in Europe; Japan recorded net
sales of almost $1 billion. Foreign transactions in U.S. stocks
swung from modest net sales in October to net purchases in November.
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States increased
by $12-1/2 billion in November after a small reduction in October
(line 1). The increase is attributable to countries outside the
G-10, with particularly large increases coming from China and
Thailand. Partial data for December from the FRBNY indicate a small
reduction in official reserves in the United States.
The large inflows through official transactions and private
purchases of U.S. securities were partially offset by large outflows
through banking transactions and U.S. purchases of foreign
securities. U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds both
declined between October and November, but the total remained above
$8 billion (line 5). Bond purchases were concentrated in the United
Kingdom, providing little information about the residence of the
issuer. Stock purchases were widespread with net purchases in Japan
totaling about $1/2 billion.
Banks and securities dealers reported large net capital
outflows in November (line 3). About $7 billion, or one-third, of
this outflow is attributable to securities dealers' lending
associated with RP transactions. The remaining $14 billion outflow
is attributable primarily to transactions between banks and their
related foreign offices. The large outflow reported on an end-of-
month basis in the Summary table is largely consistent with daily
data reported on the FR 2950/51. However, the FR data indicate that
this outflow was an end-of-month phenomenon and does not reflect the

IV-9
general pattern of funding. On a monthly-average basis, U.S.-
chartered banks reported a relatively modest, $4 billion, net
outflow vis-a-vis own foreign offices in November while foreign-
chartered banks reported a $9 billion inflow (lines la and lb of the
International Banking Data table). Bank positions vis-a-vis own
foreign offices changed little in December, on a monthly-average
basis.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar has risen about 3
percent since just before the December 19 FOMC meeting. Over this
period, the dollar has appreciated over 4 percent against the yen
and the mark while showing little net change against the Canadian
dollar.
One factor contributing to the dollar's strength against the
mark and other European currencies over this period appears to have
been market perceptions of a slowing of economic activity in most
European countries, leading to heightened expectations of further
moves toward monetary easing by European central banks. The same
explanation cannot account for the dollar's strength against the
yen, since prospects for Japanese growth appear, if anything, to
have increased recently. Some market commentary has focused on the
recent decline in Japan's external surpluses to explain the yen's
weakness. The breakdown of U.S. budget negotiations early this
month put temporary downward pressure on the dollar, but this
pressure did not seem to be either intense or prolonged.
The most notable feature of industrial-country financial
markets since mid-December has been a general move by central banks
to reduce short-term interest rates. Since the Bundesbank's
December 14 announcement of 50 basis point reductions in its
discount and Lombard rates and a 23 basis point reduction in its
repo rate, the German repo rate has declined an additional 20 basis
points in subsequent repo auctions, to a current level of 3.55
percent. On reason for the Bundesbank's easing has been the slow
growth of the targeted M3 monetary aggregate. In the fourth quarter
of last year, M3 was only 2.1 percent above its year-earlier level,
well below its 4 to 6 percent target range for this period. After a
general initial rush to follow the Bundesbank's December 14 interest

rate reductions, several other European central banks have continued
to move down money market intervention rates in recent weeks
including the Bank of England, which lowered its minimum lending
rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent on January 18. On December
19, soon after the FOMC's announcement of a 25 basis point reduction
in the federal funds rate, the Bank Of Canada indicated that it was
reducing its target range for the overnight rate by 25 basis points.
Another 25 basis point reduction was announced on January 25
lowering the target range to 5.25 percent to 5.75 percent.
Consistent with this general move to monetary easing, short
term market interest rates have declined since mid-December in all
of the major industrial countries except Japan, where the short-term
rate has edged up slightly. The largest decline has been in Italy,
70 basis points. The German short-term rate has declined about 45
basis points over the intermeeting period, about 10 basis points
more than the reduction in the U.S. 3-month rate.
Long-term rates have also decreased in nearly all of the
foreign industrial countries over the past month, with the major
exception again being Japan, where the long-term rate has risen
about 30 basis points. The largest decline in long-term rates, 70
basis points, has been in Italy, where apparently reduced prospects
for early elections may have reduced political uncertainty somewhat
The long-term rate in Germany has declined about 10 basis points on
balance, about the same as the reduction in the comparable U.S.
long-term rate over this period.
Since the December FOMC meeting, the Mexican peso has
appreciated about 4 percent against the dollar. Over this period.
Mexican short-term interest rates have declined over 10 percentage
points to below 40 percent, and Mexican stock prices have risen over
10 percent

TV-14
Since mid-December, the gold price has risen 5 percent, moving
above the $400 level. It is hard to explain the recent strength of
the gold price in terms of new fundamental factors. Possibly the
lower interest rate atmosphere has contributed to the rise.
There has been no U.S. intervention during the intermeeting
period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data on real economic activity in major foreign
industrialized countries indicate that the pace of economic growth
has generally remained sluggish. While the Japanese economy has
begun to show signs of a modest pickup, activity in Germany and
France has slowed further. Only in Italy has growth been fairly
strong, although there too, recent monthly indicators point to some
deceleration.
Inflation pressures have remained generally subdued. Prices
have fallen further in Japan, while consumer price inflation in
Canada has continued to decline from its peak in the first half of
last year. In the United Kingdom inflation has fallen slightly
after being pushed up by temporary factors last summer. Italian
inflation remains high but it is slowing after reaching a year-on-
year peak of 6 percent in November.
Financial and economic uncertainties continue to be of concern
in some countries. In Germany, the consolidated general budget
deficit widened to more than 3-1/2 percent in 1995, raising
questions about Germany's ability to meet the Maastricht deficit
criterion. In Japan, worries about the health of the banking sector
persist, although the funding premium for Japanese banks in
Eurocurrency markets remains at a modest level. In Canada, another

IV-15
referendum on Quebec sovereignty is unlikely before mid-1997
Nonetheless, uncertainty remains about the future of the Canadian
federal structure.
Individual country notes. In Japan, available indicators
suggest that the long-stalled economy showed some improvement in the
fourth quarter Industrial production turned up and housing starts
and machinery orders were particularly strong in October and
November
Prices have continued to fall The December CPI for the Tokyo
area was 0.5 percent below year-earlier levels, while wholesale
prices were down 0.3 percent over the same period. The GDP deflator
in the third quarter was 0.2 percent below its level four quarters
earlier.

than the previous survey taken in August.
The current account surplus has continued to decline,
registering $112 billion (SAAR) in the year through November, down
about $17 billion from the same period the previous year. In the
year 1995 the merchandise trade surplus (SAAR) was $107 billion,
down almost $14 billion from 1994.
On January 11 the Diet elected Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
leader Ryutaro Hashimoto as Prime Minister to succeed Tomiichi
Murayama of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The ruling coalition
consists of the conservative LDP, the left-leaning Sakigake Party,
and the formerly socialist SDP. The party leaders have stated that
they intend to keep the three-party coalition intact. The change of
Prime Ministers is not expected to cause a major shift in policies.
Many observers are expecting a new election for the lower house of
the Diet around next summer.
In Germany, the "flash" estimate for real GDP shows growth of
only 1.9 percent in 1995, considerably less than the 3 percent
recorded in 1994. Although the economic expansion held up in the
first half of last year, at a rate of roughly 2-1/2 percent (SAAR),
growth stalled in the second half. Reliable data for fourth-quarter
real GDP and its components will not be available until early March,
but it now appears likely based on the weakness of industrial
production and business confidence that real GDP declined in the
final quarter of 1995.
Concern about Germany's ability to meet the Maastricht deficit
criterion emerged with the announcement that the deficit of the
consolidated general government widened from 2.6 percent of GDP in

1994 to 3.6 percent in 1995. While the deficit had been expected to
increase somewhat in 1995 when Treuhandanstalt debt was brought onto
the books of the general government, additional fiscal slippage was
attributable to lower-than-expected tax revenues and higher-than-
expected social security expenditures.
Political tensions have been heightened by a public
controversy in the ruling coalition, with the Federal Democrats
(FDP) calling for the removal of the 7-1/2 percent solidarity
surcharge on income beginning of 1997. Chancellor Kohl's Christian
Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Socialists (CSU) argue
that the surcharge cannot be removed until 1998 at the earliest.
This public debate has increased the likelihood of the dissolution
of the ruling coalition should the FDP receive little support in
three upcoming state elections in late March.
In France, monthly indicators available for the fourth quarter
point to slower growth, even excluding the impact of the public
sector strikes. Industrial production in October-November fell 2.6
percent compared with the third-quarter average, and the December

IV-18
business survey by INSEE indicated that output growth remained weak.
The survey suggested that business confidence had deteriorated and
that inventories were above normal, pointing to a very weak fourth
quarter. The unemployment rate remained unchanged in October after
having risen slightly in September.
Real consumption of manufactured products (equal to one-third
of total consumption) in the fourth quarter was down 1.8 percent
from its third-quarter average. While such consumption rebounded in
November from its sharp decline in October (when it registered its
largest drop since January 1993), the 24-day public sector strikes
that extended through the first half of December reduced consumer
spending further. According to INSEE (the French statistical
institute), consumer confidence in December fell to its lowest level
since January 1987.
Consumer prices in December were 2.1 percent above their year-
earlier level. A modest pick-up in inflation since August has been
due largely to a 2 percentage point increase in the VAT rate to 20.6
percent on August 1.
The French merchandise trade balance (SA) registered a record
surplus in November of $2.9 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in
October, on a sharp decline in imports. During the first eleven
months of 1995. France's cumulative trade surplus registered $20
billion, almost $5 billion greater than the same period last year,
with about equal growth in both exports and imports.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP rose a preliminary 1.6 percent
(SAAR) in the fourth quarter. Industrial production was little
changed on average in October and November relative to the third-
quarter level, partly as a result of a sharp contraction in output
in the energy sector in October due to unusually warm weather.
Manufacturing output continued to be sluggish as inventories were
being worked off.

Targeted inflation, measured as the year-on-year change in
retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, remained at 2.9
percent in the fourth quarter. However, as suggested by the slowing
of 12-month producer price inflation during the fourth quarter,
upward pressure from earlier depreciation of the pound and this
summer's drought might be moderating. Inflationary expectations
plus an inflation risk premium which can be interpreted as the yield
differential between regular and index-linked gilts, has declined
about 1/2 percentage point from its October level to just under 4
percent at the end of December. The pace of the growth in average
earnings continues to be modest.
In Italy, third-quarter data (which are likely to be revised
substantially--as has occurred in past quarters) indicate that GDP
(SAAR) soared as a result of a large inventory build-up and a rise
in fixed investment following a slight decline in the second
quarter. In recent quarters, Italian GDP growth and total domestic
demand have been subject to large fluctuations from changes in
inventories. Nonetheless, final domestic demand growth at about 2-
1/2 percent has been relatively strong in the second and third
quarters. Unlike the first two quarters of 1995, net exports made a
negative contribution to growth in the third quarter, as exports
declined and imports increased. Government expenditures continued
to fall.
Available monthly indicators point to a slowdown of growth in
the fourth quarter. Both consumer confidence fell: industrial
production declined while the unemployment rate remained high; and
producers likely partially worked off the large stock of inventories
in the fourth quarter.

Inflation in Italy has stabilized but remains high. In
December, the consumer price index was 5.8 percent above its year-
earlier level, down from 6.0 percent in November. Wage inflation in
October remained relatively moderate at 3.9 percent on a year-over-
year basis, the same as the increase in September. Wholesale prices
in November were 10.4 percent above their year-earlier level, down
from 10.8 percent in October.
On December 22, the Italian Parliament approved the 1996
budget. It includes a $20 billion deficit reduction package that is
split between tax rises and reductions in public expenditure. The
1996 budget deficit is projected to be 5.8 percent of GDP, down from
7.4 percent in 1995.
On January 11, Prime Minister Dini submitted his resignation.
Currently, President Scalfaro is meeting with political party
leaders to determine if an interim bipartisan government can be
formed or if early general elections need to be held. Since the end
of December, interest rates declined by about 90 basis points
probably due to the passage of the 1996 budget and renewed optimism
that Dini will be given a second mandate.

Preliminary indicators suggest that economic activity in
Canada remained sluggish in the fourth quarter of 1995. Although
employment in December retraced November's decline, employment for
the fourth quarter as a whole was flat, and consequently the
unemployment rate was little changed at 9.4 percent. After
declining the previous two months, manufacturing shipments and new
factory orders increased in November, but the average for October
and November remained below the second-quarter average. Retail
sales in October-November also remained below the average level in
the second quarter. After rising to near the top of the Bank of
Canada's inflation target band of 1 to 3 percent in mid-1995,
consumer price inflation declined to below the mid-point of the band
in December.
Lucien Bouchard resigned from Parliament and will be sworn in
as Premier of Quebec on January 29. He has said that another
referendum on Quebec sovereignty is not likely until after a
conference between the federal and provincial governments in April
1997.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Real GDP growth has been relatively weak in Latin America, and
may be slowing to more sustainable rates in Asia. In Russia, the
rate of decline in GDP in 1995 was the smallest since reform began.
Latin American countries generally had strong trade performances in
1995 relative to 1994, with the exception of Brazil; in Asia, both
exports and imports surged, with trade balances improving in China
but falling in Taiwan and Korea.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, monthly indicators
suggest that output may have grown marginally in the fourth quarter.
Real GDP increased about 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter on a
seasonally adjusted basis (not an annual rate), but for statistical
reasons, that increase was somewhat overstated. The year-over-year
decline in industrial production was about 12 percent in October.
The unemployment rate (n.s.a.) fell steadily from September through
December, although this decline in part reflects seasonal factors.
Seasonal factors also account for much of the increase in consumer
price inflation from 2.5 percent in November to 3.3 percent in
December. The November decline in the peso and December increases
in public sector prices also contributed to inflationary pressures.
In part reflecting the continued weakness of the economy,
Mexico's trade performance remains strong. Mexico registered a
trade surplus of $7.4 billion in 1995, compared with an $18.5
billion deficit for the same period in 1994; exports rose 31
percent, while imports fell 9 percent.
In mid-December, the Bank of Mexico announced its monetary
program for 1996. The Bank anticipates that the monetary base will
grow by nearly 29 percent this year compared with expected nominal
income growth of about 24 percent. The projected rise in the demand
for monetary base relative to nominal income is expected to reflect
a decline in inflation from 52 percent (December/December) in 1995

In Brazil, economic activity may have begun to recover from a
decline in the second and third quarters of 1995, when real GDP fell
on a seasonally adjusted basis (though it remained positive on a
year-over-year basis). Inflation remains relatively low.
Brazil recorded a small trade surplus in the fourth quarter.

In Argentina, real GDP fell an estimated 3.5 percent in 1995.
while inflation remained low: Consumer prices rose 1.7 percent in
December from a year earlier. The unemployment rate fell slightly
in October 1995 to 16.4 percent, down from the record 18.4 percent
in May. However, this fall resulted mostly from a fall in the
participation rate, not an increase in employment. In the first
eleven months of 1995, exports rose 31 percent from the year-earlier
period, while imports declined almost 9 percent. However, the
monthly trade surplus peaked in June. Gross international reserves
increased slightly in the last month and stood at $18.5 billion on
December 28. This increase in reserves is due to a disbursement
from the IMF and the proceeds of bond placements, as well as to a
change in the definition of international reserves, which now
include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. Of the $18.5
billion, $2.6 billion are in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds and $1.9
are in net repurchase agreements. The monetary base was $13.1
billion, leaving $5.4 billion in excess reserves.

Argentina met the fiscal and monetary targets under its IMF
program for 1995, which allowed the government to receive about $400
million in December. However, real tax revenues fell nine percent
in 1995 from a year earlier. The government is currently

IV-29
negotiating with the IMF for a new one-year $1 billion stand-by
program; the current program runs out in March.
In Venezuela, real GDP grew an estimated 2 percent in 1995.
However, this performance resulted from the strong performance of
the oil sector, which grew 6 percent. Economic activity in the non-
oil sector continued to decline, contributing to rising unemployment
in 1995. Consumer price inflation picked up in the fourth quarter,
but the 57 percent rise in prices during 1995 was below the 71
percent rise for 1994. Venezuela registered a merchandise (non-oil)
trade deficit of $4.8 billion for the first ten months of 1995, up
from a deficit of $3.1 billion during the year-earlier period,
reflecting an 18 percent increase in exports and a 34 percent
increase in imports.
Discussions with the IMF to establish a program are scheduled
to resume in late January. Substantial disagreements remain between
the Venezuelan government and the IMF regarding increases in
gasoline prices and taxes.

In Korea, growth in economic activity appears to be slowing to
a more sustainable rate, following two years of extremely rapid
growth. Industrial production growth fell markedly in October and
November, and a substantial deceleration in imports of capital goods
during the second half of last year suggests that the investment
boom of 1994-95 is tapering off. Export growth, although strong,

IV-31
also declined somewhat in the last quarter of 1995, in part because
of the substantial appreciation of the Korean won against the yen
that occurred since mid-summer. Consumer price inflation has
remained stable during the past year, and low compared with past
cyclical expansions: Consumer prices were 4.7 percent higher in
December 1995 than their year-earlier level.
Both merchandise imports and exports increased by 35 percent
during the first eleven months of 1995 from their year-earlier
level. Because imports began from a higher base, this contributed to
a widening of Korea's current account deficit to $8.5 billion (2
percent of GDP) during the first eleven months of the year, up from
$4.6 billion over the same period a year earlier.

3 percent, following double-digit declines during the three previous
years. In recent weeks, the ruble has remained relatively stable

all of the program's performance criteria and quantitative
indicative targets through end-November. The fiscal deficit during
October and November was larger than in previous months, reflecting
spending pressures as December's parliamentary election approached,
but the cumulative 1995 deficit remained below the program's
requirement. The Russian government and the IMF are in the final
stages of negotiating a three-year Extended Fund Facility, as a
successor agreement to the stand-by that expires in the first
quarter of 1996.
The December parliamentary election resulted in a
significantly more conservative Duma. The Communist Party and its
allies won 42 percent of the seats, almost twice their
representation in the old Duma. Reformist parties won about a
quarter of the seats, while ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
party won 11 percent. The remaining seats were split between small
parties and independent candidates. In mid-January, the Duma
elected Communist Gennady Seleznyov as its Chairman, replacing
moderate Ivan Rybkin.
On January 16, First Deputy Prime Minister Chubais resigned,
after he was sharply criticized by President Yeltsin. Chubais, the
chief engineer of Russia's 1995 stabilization program and the 1993-
94 voucher privatization campaign, was the government's leading

IV-33
economic reformer. Analysts believe that Yeltsin is attempting to
strike a more conservative stance in preparation for June's
Presidential election. This said, both Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin have publicly stated that they intend to continue
economic reforms.
