DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Despite storms, strikes, shutdowns--and inventory imbalances--
the economic expansion evidently survived the winter. Employment
and industrial production surged in February to levels that suggest
that real GDP will post a decent gain in the first quarter after
almost stalling out in the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, inflation
has remained on a fairly steady trend, with the core CPI continuing
to run in the vicinity of 3 percent on a twelve-month basis.
The General Motors Strike
The UAW has announced an end to the strike at Delphi Chassis
Systems, which produces brake systems for General Motors. The
strike, which began on March 5, forced GM to shut down virtually all
of its North American assembly plants and severely curtail parts
production. Outsourcing of parts production was the main issue in
dispute. In total, GM had furloughed about 175,000 North American
workers: layoffs at GM's suppliers were also beginning to mount but
are difficult to estimate.1 The union will vote on the agreement
on March 23.
Confidential information from GM indicates that the strike
reduced production about 2 million units at an annual rate. The
staff forecast assumed that assembly line workers would be back on
the job on March 25 and that production for the industry as a whole
would total 9.7 million units in March, more than 2 million units
below the industry's pre-strike schedules. (As the Greenbook was
1. About 38,000 workers were off their jobs for the entire pay
period covered by the March employment survey and will show up as
reduced employment in the report; another 40,000 to 50,000 workers
were off for part of the period and thus will show up as having
shortened workweeks. The strike was a key factor in the 32,000
increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance in the week
ended March 16, but its full effect has not yet shown through to the
claims data. Analysts at the Department of Labor suspect that some
states have been slow to process the surge in claims and expect to
see either a revision to data for the week ended March 16 or a bulge
in claims this week.

1. Staff estimate based on weekly production data
through March 16 and latest industry schedules adjusted to
reflect confidential GM estimate of production lost
because of the strike.
In contrast to Chrysler and Ford, GM had fairly high
inventories at the end of February--its dealers had a seventy-seven-
day supply of cars and a sixty-eight-day supply of trucks, measured
using a three-month average of sales. Thus, the strike is not
likely to have much effect on sales in March. Rather, it allowed GM
to accelerate an inventory adjustment that probably would have
occurred in the second quarter in the absence of the strike.
We estimate that the strike will subtract about a
percentage point from the growth in industrial production in March.
We also expect it to reduce real GDP growth about 3/4 percentage
point at an annual rate in the first quarter.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market report for February was very strong:
Payroll employment and aggregate hours soared, reaching levels
substantially above those recorded in December, and the unemployment
rate fell back to around its year-end level. However, it seems
likely that the December-February movements overstate the underlying
strength of labor demand. The resurgence in hiring by suppliers of

temporary help and by firms in some other categories may be driven
in part by efforts to make up January's production losses,
particularly in manufacturing. Furthermore, the BLS cites seasonal
influences as contributing to the big gains in construction and
retail trade jobs early this year.2 Finally, although initial
claims have been trending lower of late (abstracting from the GM
strike), they still do not display the exceptional robustness
indicated by the February employment report.
In contrast to the gains in most other sectors,
manufacturing employment dropped 50,000 between December and
February, in line with the average rate at which jobs have been shed
since the most recent peak in factory employment in March 1995. The
average factory workweek, which also weakened last year and was
further depressed by the blizzard in January, rebounded sharply in
February to the highest level since last September. The lengthening
of the workweek likely reflected in part firms' efforts to recoup
the production lost during the blizzard, but it may also be a
precursor of strengthening activity in manufacturing. All told,
aggregate hours of manufacturing production workers were 3/4 percent
higher in February than in December.
In the nonfarm business sector as a whole, a February rise
in the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers more
than reversed a steep January decline. This swing in the workweek,
together with the monthly changes in payroll employment, led
aggregate hours to decline 2.0 percent in January and rise
3.2 percent in February. Although the average level of aggregate
2. According to the BLS, some of the increase in seasonally
adjusted construction employment occurred because seasonal layoffs,
which normally extend through February, were made earlier than
usual, beginning in November. Similarly, employment growth in
retail trade in early 1996, may have been exaggerated because the
smaller-than-usual seasonal hiring last fall implied smaller-than-
usual seasonal layoffs after the holidays.

II-6
hours for the two months was 0.7 percent below the fourth-quarter
average, the actual labor input probably was greater than these data
indicate because the January survey period included the week most
affected by the blizzard. Making plausible adjustments to correct
for the blizzard, we estimate that the average level of hours in
January and February would have been up roughly 1/2 percent from the
fourth quarter. Such a gain normally would indicate moderate growth
in real GDP.
A similar message comes from application of the Okun's law
model to the results of the household survey. After ticking up in
January to 5.8 percent, the civilian unemployment rate fell
0.3 percentage point in February, to 5.5 percent. Using concurrent
seasonal factors and taking into account the slight overstatement of
the January unemployment rate because of the blizzard, we estimate
that the unemployment rate in January and February was unchanged
from its December level of 5.6 percent; this points to a gain in
aggregate output roughly in line with long-run potential growth,
which we put at about 2 percent per year.
Among other indicators of labor market activity, initial
claims have improved a bit recently. Although claims under state
programs jumped to 384,000 in the week ending on March 16, the
increase probably was attributable to the strike at General Motors.
In the three preceding weeks, claims had averaged 358,000 versus
374,000 between January and mid-February. Additionally, the
Conference Board's index of help wanted held nearly steady in
January after rising 6 points in December. On the other hand, the
Manpower Employment Outlook Survey shows that expectations of net
hiring (for the second quarter) have fallen to their lowest level in
two years.

II-7
Industrial Production
Industrial production is estimated to have risen
1.2 percent in February after a 0.4 percent decline in January that
was related in part to the blizzard. Roughly one-third of the
0.8 percent net rise in output from December to February reflected
an upturn in aircraft production after the settlement of the strike
at Boeing. In addition, output of office and computing machines
continued to soar. And, in February, a surge in semiconductor
production boosted the index for durable goods materials, and
production of other business equipment picked up. Motor vehicles
assemblies rose 3/4 million units to an 11.9 million unit annual
rate in February, thus making a substantial contribution to IP
growth that month, but this increase only reversed a decline in
January, and motor vehicles had little net effect on overall output
growth over the two months. Output of non-auto consumer goods
dropped sharply in January, likely in response to the effects of the
blizzard and firms' efforts to reduce inventories, and a February
rebound carried production of these goods only back to about its
December level. Output of construction supplies also showed little
net change over the two months.

Information on industrial activity in March is limited, but
production will, of course, be depressed substantially by the strike
at GM, which we expect to subtract about 1 percentage point from IP
growth. Outside of motor vehicles and parts, the available
information thus far suggests little change in output this month.
On net, manufacturing output has grown about in line with
estimated capacity over the past few months, leaving the utilization
3rate at around 82 percent in February. The overall factory
utilization rate now stands about 1/2 percentage point above its
1967-95 average, buoyed by sustained high readings for industrial
machinery and computer equipment, primary metals, and petroleum
products. In contrast, operating rates for nondurables, notably
textiles, apparel, and paper, have fallen sharply over the past
year, a drop reflecting producers' efforts to adjust production to
softer sales; operating rates for these nondurables now are well
below their long-term averages.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending appears to have returned to a moderate growth
path after hitting a lull in late 1995. Although readings on
consumer sentiment from both the Michigan SRC and the Conference
Board surveys sagged in early 1996, the most recent results in both
surveys have been quite positive. In addition, data on motor
vehicles and retail sales suggest that real outlays for goods in
February were noticeably above their fourth-quarter levels.
Sales of new light vehicles averaged 15 million units at an
annual rate in December and January and climbed to a hefty
15-3/4 million unit rate in February. The recent strength has been
3. We estimate that overall manufacturing capacity is currently
growing at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, a pace similar to that of
1995.

concentrated in the retail segment of the market--confidential data
from Ford and GM indicate that their combined fleet sales have
fallen below the fourth-quarter pace. Retail light vehicle
purchases in the past few months have been bolstered by incentives
from Ford and Chrysler, which were introduced around the turn of the
year. The incentives also contributed to the more favorable
readings of the Michigan index of car buying conditions in February
and early March.
Spending at the "control" category of retail stores, which
excludes automotive dealers and building materials and supply
outlets, increased 0.4 percent in February after a flat January.
Most major categories of retail sales turned upward in February.
Nominal spending at furniture and appliance and "other" durable
goods stores rose a little, although it remained noticeably below
its level at the end of last year. Sales at apparel stores posted a
sizable gain in February after a languid performance in 1995, and
outlays at general merchandise stores surged after declining in the
fourth quarter and edging up in January.
Official estimates of spending for services are available only
through January, but outlays apparently remain on the moderate
uptrend that has been evident over the past few years. Real
spending on non-energy services, which had posted solid gains in
November and December, edged up in January to a level roughly
1/2 percent (not at an annual rate) above its fourth-quarter
average. In contrast, energy services declined in January, and data
on weather for the nation as a whole suggest that spending on energy
services may have declined a bit further in February; however, these
declines were not large enough to put much of a dent in overall PCE.
Taking a longer view, consumer spending has fallen short of the
gain in real disposable income over the past few quarters, and the

personal saving rate has moved up--despite the large increase in
household wealth since the end of 1994. This upturn may prove just
to be short-term noise in the time series; it could even disappear
in later NIPA revisions. But there are possible explanations for
this seemingly anomalous pattern. First, it is important to note
that econometric models that capture significant stock market wealth
effects also suggest that the effects may take some time to play
out; the effect on the saving rate of the recent rally would be
small to this point, perhaps on the order of 1/4 percentage point
(ceteris paribus). Second, other factors could be masking the stock
market effect. For example, increased debt burdens may be hindering
spending--the ratio of debt service payments to disposable income in
the fourth quarter was 3/4 percentage point higher than its level
one year earlier. Moreover, consumer delinquency rates have
generally risen over the past year, suggesting that some households
are having greater difficulty servicing their increased debt
burdens. However, as long as income growth remains sound, these
financial stresses are probably not widespread enough to be a
significant deterrent to overall consumption.
The recent increases in the saving rate also could be part of a
longer-run upward adjustment in response to demographic changes and
heightened awareness of the need to provide for retirement and
medical costs. In addition, the media focus on job insecurity may
have contributed to a greater perceived need for precautionary
saving.
Housing Markets
New housing construction edged up in January--despite the
blizzard--and rose still further in February. Total housing starts
last month, at 1.49 million units, were the highest since December
1994.

Single-family housing starts edged down in January and
increased moderately in February; starts for the two months averaged
1.16 million units at an annual rate, about 2-1/2 percent above the
fourth-quarter average. Permit issuance for single-family homes
also edged up in February, after falling in January. Judging from
historical relationships, starts in January and February were well
in line with permit issuance.
Most other indicators of single-family housing activity have
also shown signs of strengthening. New home sales rose 4.2 percent
in January to 693,000 units, the most rapid pace since last August.
Moreover, the March sampling of builders' opinions suggests that new
home sales rose substantially in late February and early March.
Consumer appraisals of homebuying conditions, as sampled by the
Michigan survey, improved noticeably in February and early March,
owing mainly to a more general perception that mortgage rates are
low. Applications for home financing at mortgage bankers remained
relatively strong through mid-March, although they are down a bit
from the very high range of late 1995.
In contrast to the rise in new home sales, existing home sales
declined for the fourth consecutive month in January. This series
tends to be a lagging indicator of housing demand, however, because
a substantial share of existing home sales are recorded at the
closing, often months after a purchase contract has been signed.
Thus, existing home sales may not reflect changes that are evident
in more timely measures of demand for single-family housing.
In the multifamily housing sector, starts rose substantially in
January and moderately in February, largely offsetting a decline in
December. A step-up from the extremely low levels of multifamily
construction seen in recent years is not surprising, but the vacancy

rate for multifamily rental units is still high--suggesting some
limit on the near-term potential for further gains.
Business Fixed Investment
At the time of the last Greenbook, investment indicators were
lagging to an unusual degree because of the government shutdown.
The data releases, though back on schedule, are still not as current
as one would like. However, they now suggest that equipment demand
remained fairly robust into early 1996--indeed, surprisingly so--
while construction spending decelerated somewhat.
New orders reported by U.S. manufacturers of business equipment
were particularly strong in the office and computing category,
rising 3 percent in January after surging in the fourth quarter.
Shipments of these items also continued to post healthy gains. The
sustained strength in computer spending seems at odds with the
pounding that computer company stocks have taken in recent weeks:
Our industry contacts' explanation is that competitive pressures
have reduced margins and profitability, with the corresponding price
competition helping to maintain demand.
Orders at producers of other nondefense capital goods,
excluding aircraft and parts, were also quite positive through
January, although shipments dropped back after rising moderately in
the fourth quarter. Notably, much of the January drop in shipments
was in two industries: communications equipment, for which
shipments had soared in late 1995, and railroad equipment, which
tends to gyrate wildly from month to month.
As for transportation equipment, business purchases of motor
vehicles have been about flat so far this year despite the sharp
decline in new orders for heavy trucks in 1995. Shipments of
complete aircraft have been weak in recent months, in part because
of the Boeing strike. However, the weakness in aircraft should be

transitory: Airline profits are high, new products are coming on
line, and orders are surging. Boeing has announced plans to hire
additional workers and expand production, and the prospective
improvement in activity is affecting many of its suppliers as well.
A glance at the chart showing the fundamental determinants
suggests the sources of the continued expansion in equipment
spending. While accelerator effects have been about neutral over
the past year, recent movements in the user cost of capital and in
cash flow have been favorable. The user cost of computers has
continued to plummet because of falling prices, and this pattern is
likely to be extended in the near term with, among other things, a
sharp drop in semiconductor prices contributing to the trend.
Growth in outlays for nonresidential construction appears to
have slowed recently after three years of progressively stronger
increases. Although non-office commercial construction has
continued to trend up, the data on construction put-in-place suggest
that activity has slowed noticeably in recent months in the office,
institutional building, and industrial sectors. Contracts for these
sectors have also been softening over the past several months.
Other indicators are more favorable: Senior examiners and asset
managers at federal banking agencies remain fairly upbeat in their
assessments of commercial real estate conditions (as compiled in the
FDIC's January Survey of Real Estate Trends); vacancy rates in the
commercial and industrial sectors are well below the levels of a few
years ago; and prices, as measured by the NREI index, have continued
to firm.
Inventories
Following only a modest increase in November and outright
liquidation of stocks in December, business inventories expanded
sharply in January. Excluding motor vehicles at trade

II-25
establishments, book-value stocks in manufacturing and trade
increased at an annual rate of more than $50 billion in January,
after rising only about $10 billion in the fourth quarter.
Interpretation of the January data is complicated by the winter
storms, which caused delays in shipments and sales and thus may have
caused inventories to back up at manufacturers and wholesalers.
Retail stocks edged down, despite flat sales. In any event, firms
apparently made considerable progress in rectifying inventory
imbalances in late 1995, and recent trends in orders and production
bode well for further improvement in early 1996.

Sizable increases in manufacturing inventories in January were
evident in both capital goods industries and elsewhere. Within
capital goods, stocks of information-related equipment have
continued to rise briskly in recent months, while stocks of
industrial machinery and "other" producers' durable equipment have
shown little net increase since mid-1995. The inventory-shipments
ratio for manufacturing capital goods moved up in January, but the
jump was largely due to a sharp drop in shipments, which the
firmness of orders suggests was transitory. The picture for
inventories outside of capital goods is less sanguine--for example,

manufacturers' stocks of home goods and apparel, as well as some
materials, probably remain above desired levels--and the inventory-
sales ratio for this group as a whole has changed little, on net, in
recent months, after rising sharply over the first half of 1995.
In wholesale trade, inventories also expanded substantially in
January. In addition, the wholesalers' December inventory change
was revised up to show a small accumulation instead of the sharp
drawdown indicated in the preliminary report. As in manufacturing,
stocks of capital goods have continued to rise at a rapid pace in
recent months, and the inventory-sales ratio has fluctuated in a
fairly narrow range. Elsewhere in wholesale trade, changes in
stocks have been small in the aggregate in recent months, and
although the inventory-sales ratio edged up in January, it remained
well below the highs of last fall.
In the retail sector, nonvehicle inventories fell a bit further
in January, after plunging in December. The January decrease may
have been related in part to the blizzard disruptions and the backup
of goods at earlier stages of the distribution channel. Stores
selling apparel and furniture recorded sizable net liquidations over
the two months; as a result, the inventory-sales ratio for apparel
stores has fallen well below the levels that prevailed over much of
1995, while the ratio for furniture stores has also dropped
somewhat. In contrast, the inventory-sales ratio for general
merchandisers remained at the elevated level that has been evident
since late fall: the strong gain in general merchandise sales in
February should have helped restore stocks to more comfortable
levels.

12 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995, with double-digit declines
for both nondefense and defense purchases. The drop in defense
outlays was much sharper than the underlying trend as a consequence
of a plunge in deliveries of aircraft and other military equipment.
Nondefense spending was depressed by the reduction in real employee
compensation during the two government shutdowns and the restraint
implied by the appropriations and continuing resolutions for fiscal
1996.
In the unified budget, receipts have grown at a solid pace this
fiscal year, and outlays have risen only a little. Thus, the
deficit for the first four months of fiscal 1996 was just
$37 billion, $21 billion below that recorded during the comparable
period one year earlier.
The Congress has made only slight progress on appropriations
since the last Greenbook, and programs covered by the five unpassed
appropriations bills are being funded by the latest in a string of
continuing resolutions. In the aggregate, the current funding
levels for discretionary programs are more generous than those in
the continuing resolutions in place during the first few months of
fiscal 1996. Moreover, some agencies are now in a position to make
certain large annual payments, normally disbursed in the fall, that
were delayed by the difficulties in the appropriations process; for
example, the annual foreign aid payment to Israel, which totals
about $3 billion, was not remitted in its entirety until February.
On March 15 the President signed a one-week extension of the
continuing resolution, and he is expected to sign a further
4. After adjusting for shifts in the timing of certain federal
payments and excluding deposit insurance, the deficit for the first
four months of fiscal 1996 was $46 billion, $24 billion less than
during the comparable period one year earlier. (Timing adjustments
take account of the shifting of scheduled outlays for payroll and
some benefits into the preceding month when the first of the month
occurs on a weekend or holiday.)

extension by tomorrow, March 22. These extensions are designed to
give the President and the Congress more time for negotiations on an
omnibus appropriations bill for the remainder of the fiscal year.
The bill is expected to set overall spending at the levels specified
in the budget resolution, with any increases for particular programs
offset by reductions in spending for other programs or increases in
receipts. In other recent legislation, the President signed a bill
providing for a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, now set to
expire on March 29.
On March 19 the Administration released its fiscal year 1997
budget. The President's policy proposals are similar to those
incorporated in the preliminary budget document issued in February.
However, in contrast to the budget projections in the February
document, the Administration's new projections are based on a full
set of updated economic and technical assumptions. According to
OMB, if the President's plan were enacted, the deficit would drop to
$146 billion in fiscal 1996 and edge down to $140 billion in fiscal
1997; the budget position would improve steadily thereafter, showing
a sizable surplus by fiscal 2002. Under CBO's December economic and
technical assumptions (with adjustments by OMB), the budget would
also show a surplus in fiscal 2002, but it would be much smaller
than OMB's estimate. CBO will revise its assumptions this spring;
if the President's budget shows a deficit in fiscal 2002 under the
revised assumptions, the President will reduce his proposals for
discretionary spending by the amount needed to eliminate the
deficit.
State and Local Government Sector
Total real consumption and gross investment spending by state
and local governments has remained on the moderate uptrend that has
been evident since 1992. The 1-1/2 percent annual rate increase in

real spending in the fourth quarter was a bit below trend, but much
of the slowing reflected developments in the volatile construction
category. A noticeable upturn in outlays seems to be under way in
the current quarter, mainly because of a 1.6 percent jump in real
construction spending in January. The increase in construction in
January was broadly based and followed average gains of 0.3 percent
per month in the second half of last year. Employment grew 15,000
per month, on average, in January and February, about the same as
the pace over 1995 as a whole.
The fiscal position of the state and local sector remains sound
in the aggregate. The NIPA surplus of current operating accounts,
excluding social insurance funds, probably remained in the area of
$35 billion to $40 billion in the fourth quarter, a level similar to
the readings for the past two years and considerably above those of
the early 1990s. As fiscal positions have improved, many states
have cut taxes, in most cases by small amounts. This year again,
governors of many states are proposing fairly limited tax cuts.
Prices
Although data collection problems related to the government
shutdown and the January blizzard have created some uncertainty
about the reliability of the statistics, inflation appears to have
remained relatively stable over the past few months. Notably, the
core CPI increased an average of 0.2 percent per month over the past
three months, and the twelve-month change has held steady at around
3 percent. Prices have also remained in check at the producer
level; on net, the PPI for items other than food and energy was flat
between December and February.
Consumer energy prices increased 0.4 percent in February after
having posted much larger increases in December and January. Most
of the rise in February reflected a surge in natural gas prices as

the unusually cold winter depleted natural gas stocks in many parts
of the country. In contrast, prices of gasoline and heating oil
were little changed in February; these prices had soared around the
turn of the year as increases in crude oil prices in late 1995 fed
through the system. However, the lull in prices of petroleum-based
products may be short-lived: Stocks of both gasoline and crude oil
remain low, and prices for crude oil surged in mid-March.
Food prices edged up just 0.1 percent in February and have
increased just a little more than 2 percent over the past twelve
months. Prices for fruits and vegetables dropped a bit further in
February, while prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs were little
changed for a second month. In recent months, price increases in
grain markets seem to have shown through in some components of the
CPI for food, notably cereal and bakery products and dairy products,
but those increases have been offset by favorable developments in
other categories. Grain stocks at the end of the summer still are
projected to be tight, and the markets remain sensitive to changes
in conditions for the 1996 crop, as shown most recently by market
perceptions of changing weather conditions in the southern and
central plains, a major wheat-producing area.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy slipped
0.1 percent in February after having risen 0.4 percent in January.
In part, this pattern reflects the one-week delay in the January
survey period because of the government shutdown. The effect was
especially pronounced for merchandise for which the delayed survey
missed the usual post-holiday markdowns. Notably, apparel prices
fell 1 percent in February after spurting 0.7 percent in January.
5. The high grain prices have come at a particularly bad time for
livestock producers because cattle prices are the lowest in several
years and feeders' margins are being squeezed. The low prices for
slaughter cattle have been reflected in retail prices for beef,
which have edged down over the past three months.

Elsewhere, prices for new cars and trucks rose moderately in
February after having remained essentially unchanged over December
and January. Prices of vehicles have been held down in recent
months by price-based incentives introduced by Ford and Chrysler in
order to reduce bloated stocks; these incentive programs have also
included generous financing options, which have contributed to the
sharp drop in the auto-finance component of the CPI for services in
recent months.
The CPI for non-energy services rose 0.3 percent in February, a
rise identical to that in January and similar to the trend for the
past two years. The February increase was fueled by a turnaround in
airfares, which had fallen sharply over the preceding several
months. On the other hand, the increase for shelter costs (which
account for about half of non-energy services) was a bit below
trend, and the CPI for medical services rose a relatively modest
0.2 percent. Taking a longer perspective, the twelve-month change
in the CPI for medical services has dropped to around 4 percent
after having increased about 5-1/2 percent per year over the
6previous two years.
At the producer level, prices for finished goods excluding food
and energy rose 0.1 percent in February after falling a bit in
January; these prices have risen about 2 percent in the past twelve
months. Prices for intermediate materials excluding food and energy
6. The inadequacies of the medical care component of the CPI have
received much attention. The BLS now surveys medical prices as part
of the producer price index program, and the PPI's methodology is
better than the CPI's in several respects. In particular, unlike
the CPI, which measures only the "list" prices set by hospitals and
doctors, the PPI attempts to capture transactions prices, in part by
following contracts between medical providers and insurance
companies. Thus, if a new contract with an insurance company leads
to a greater discount relative to the list price than in the past,
it would be captured by the PPI, but not the CPI. Analysis of the
PPI data suggests that the CPI may be overstating the annual
increase in medical service prices by about 2-1/2 percentage points.
Nonetheless, the PPI provides no evidence that the CPI is
understating the deceleration in medical costs in recent years.

fell 0.2 percent in February, declining for the fifth consecutive
month.
Prices of industrial commodities have eased a bit since the
last Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial
commodity prices has changed little on net since late January, with
a sharp decline in its textile component mostly offset by a run-up
in the petroleum index. The JOC metals index has risen about
1-1/2 percent since the last Greenbook. Copper prices, volatile in
recent weeks, were pushed down earlier this year by weaker economic
activity and, to some extent, by weak export demand, but they appear
to have recovered and now stand about 3-1/2 percent above their
level in late January. Prices for aluminum, also volatile recently,
are about 4 percent higher than at the time of the last Greenbook.
Lead prices soared 7-1/2 percent this week, as supplies became very
tight in U.S. markets. In contrast, steel scrap prices have fallen
about 4 percent since the last Greenbook, but they remain at about
the average level for 1995.
Labor Costs
As measured by the employment cost index (ECI), the hourly
compensation of private industry workers increased at an annual rate
of 3-1/2 percent over the three months ended in December 1995, up
from a 2-1/2 percent annual rate over the first nine months of the
year. The uptick in compensation growth was widespread across
industrial and occupational groups and largely reflected an
acceleration in payments for health insurance benefits. Wages and
salaries increased 2-1/2 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate in the fourth quarter, a bit less than over the first nine
months of the year, and costs of most nonhealth benefits--such as

fourth quarter, the decelerating trend in these benefits remained
intact through 1995. Over the year as a whole, health costs rose
only 1/2 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent in 1994 and
a high of about 14 percent in the late 1980s. In addition to the
slowing in medical care costs, the switch in insurance arrangements
from traditional indemnity plans to HMOs and other managed care
plans and changes in the provisions of the health plans (including
greater sharing of health care costs with employees) may also have
contributed to the slowdown in employer-paid health benefits.8
Analysts remain uncertain about how much of the slowing is
sustainable and how much is a one-time saving associated mainly with
the shift from traditional insurance plans to lower-cost
alternatives. On one hand, the recent CPI and PPI data suggest that
the trends in underlying medical costs remain favorable; these
should affect insurance premiums with a lag. On the other hand,
some experts, who note that insurance premiums have decelerated more
over the past few years than have underlying medical costs, see some
catch-up in the offing.
7. Nonproduction bonuses, which are only a small part of benefit
costs in the ECI, increased sharply in the fourth quarter, likely
in reflection of the 10 percent lump-sum payment to Boeing workers
that followed the December 1995 resolution of their strike.
8. According to the 1995 Hay/Huggins Benefits Report, 69 percent
of firms had a fee-for-service plan as its "primary medical plan" in
1991, while 9 percent had a preferred provider plan and 22 percent
had an HMO or point-of-service plan. In 1995, only 34 percent of
firms had a fee-for-service plan as its primary plan, while
29 percent had a preferred provider plan and 37 percent had an HMO
or point-of-service plan.

Nonfarm hourly compensation, from the productivity and cost
data, rose 3 percent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the
fourth quarter; for all of 1995, nonfarm hourly compensation
increased about 4 percent, after rising 2-1/2 percent in 1994.
Because this pattern differs so dramatically from that in the ECI,
it is useful to note that although the two compensation measures
show fairly similar long-run patterns, they often diverge
substantially over shorter periods--especially in recent years, when
the NIPA compensation data have not yet been benchmarked to
comprehensive source data. Much of the discrepancy arises simply
because the data are collected from different sources. In addition,
because nonfarm hourly compensation does not use fixed weights as
does the ECI, it can be affected by changes in the composition of
employment.9 Also, the ECI explicitly incorporates current
information on benefit costs, whereas the hourly compensation
measure tends to extrapolate recent trends in benefits.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector apparently fell in
the fourth quarter as output decelerated sharply.10 The decline
followed strong gains over the preceding two quarters; nonetheless,
over 1995 as a whole, productivity growth fell short of its long-
term trend, which we estimate at about 1 percent per year.
Labor cost data for 1996 are sparse. Average hourly earnings
of production or nonsupervisory workers in private nonagricultural
9. The wage and salary portion of nonfarm hourly compensation for
1995 is based largely on average hourly earnings (AHE). Whereas the
ECI holds the mix of industries and occupations in its sample
constant, the AHE does not. The 0.3 percentage point acceleration
of the AHE between 1994 and 1995 is largely attributable to changes
in the industrial composition of employment; a chain-weighted
version of the AHE, which has been available since January 1994 and
holds the industry mix constant, shows an increase of 2.8 percent in
each year.
10. The fourth-quarter report on productivity and costs showed
output per hour dropping 1/2 percent at an annual rate. However,
given the likely revisions to output, we expect the decline in
productivity to be revised to about 1 percent.

establishments edged down in February after jumping 0.4 percent in
January. For the twelve-month period ended in February, average
hourly earnings grew 2.9 percent--in the middle of the range
observed since late 1994.
Recession Probabilities
The recession probability measures based on the indexes of
leading economic indicators continue to diverge. According to a
measure based on the Conference Board's index of leading economic
indicators (LEI). the probability of a recession starting within six
months was 60 percent in January, after readings in the range of
30 percent to 50 percent since the spring of 1995. These relatively
high probabilities reflect the sizable decline in sensitive
materials prices, which make up about 40 percent of the index, since
mid-1995. It is difficult to interpret the declines in sensitive
materials prices because they have been largely concentrated in
wastepaper, where prices have reversed the huge run-up between
mid-1994 and mid-1995. The probability of recession from a version
of the LEI that excludes materials prices was just 16 percent in
January. The recession probability was also boosted substantially
in January by the decline in the manufacturing workweek (which was
more than reversed in February).
The January reading of the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER) measure, which places a heavier weight on financial
variables, puts the probability of recession at only 1 percent. An
alternative version of the NBER index that excludes interest rates
and interest rate spreads puts the probability of recession at
13 percent. The NBER indexes do not include the manufacturing
workweek, but they do include part-time employment due to slack
work; this variable declined in January, possibly because of the
blizzard, making a positive contribution to the indexes.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Intermediate- and long-term interest rates have backed up about
55 to 65 basis points since the beginning of February, primarily on
stronger economic data. Short-term interest rates fluctuated during
the period, but now stand near their levels at the January FOMC
meeting. Short-term interest rates initially had edged down about
1/4 percentage point following the System policy change at the
January meeting and, judging from federal funds futures data in
early February, market participants appeared to place high odds on a
further 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at the March FOMC
meeting with additional easing by early summer (chart). However,
Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Congress regarding the
FOMC's forecasts of moderate economic growth along with the
subsequent release of stunningly strong employment data in early
March were seen as largely erasing any possibility of near-term
System easing and as raising questions about the direction of
monetary policy down the road. Moreover, election-year rhetoric
suggested that agreement on a major deficit-reduction plan was an
even more remote probability. Despite the rise in interest rates,
major stock-price indexes advanced between 3 and 5-1/2 percent over
the intermeeting period.
The growth of aggregate nonfederal debt has not deviated
appreciably from the moderate pace of the past two years. Although
some recent signs point to a slowing in household borrowing,
consumer credit has continued to climb relative to disposable
income. Corporate bond issuance has slackened with the backup in
rates; overall business borrowing this quarter will be buoyed,
however, by the completion of large merger transactions. New
issuance of state and local government securities also dipped with

the rise in yields in late February; on balance, tax-exempt debt has
continued to contract with heavy retirements of pre-refunded debt.
The federal government's borrowing has picked up after the
disruptions of the fourth quarter. The Treasury's plans have been
complicated to a small degree by the continuing dispute over the
debt ceiling, but regular monthly two- and five-year note auctions
proceeded on schedule.
Equity Price Developments
Although share prices posted strong gains over the intermeeting
period, broad measures of stock prices declined sharply on Friday,
March 8, after the release of unexpectedly strong employment data
for February. At one point that day, the Dow Jones Industrial
average had declined 215 points--approaching the 250 point trigger
that would have suspended trading on the NYSE for one hour.
However, prices recovered, finishing down 171 points, and most broad
indexes have since recouped that day's decline; indeed, some,
including the DJI, have proceeded to register new highs (chart). At
the same time, the markets have been quite volatile (chart).
The run-up in stock prices this year seems hard to reconcile
with higher interest rates and with reports that securities analysts
have, if anything, lowered their earnings forecasts for 1996. Based
on some benchmarks for equity valuation, stock prices appear
somewhat overvalued. For example, the expected earnings yield for
the S&P 500--the ratio of security analysts' expectations for year-
ahead earnings to current price--moved roughly in parallel with
long-term bond yields during 1994 and 1995, but has fallen
appreciably this year to a rather low level (chart, middle panel).
This decline, viewed against the recent backup in long-term yields,
implies a considerable decline of the so-called equity premium,
which some have asserted was already unsustainably narrow.

III-5
Nonetheless, at least one indicator suggests that confidence in
the prospects for a continuation of the bull market has not been
weakening. On certain assumptions, the ratio of prices on out-of-
the-money put and call options on stock price indexes can help to
gauge the market's assessment of risks associated with prevailing
stock prices. A put-to-call price ratio greater than 1, for
example, can be interpreted as implying a greater likelihood of a
downward movement in stock prices. For futures contracts on the S&P
500 stock index, the put-call ratio has fallen considerably on
balance since the end of 1994, suggesting that investors have become
less concerned about the prospects for a significant drop in stock
prices. Indeed, the historical record of sharp sizable stock price
declines over the past forty years--declines on the order of 10
percent or more over a two-month period--reveals little precedent
for such market breaks in the absence of a significant Federal
Reserve tightening or a jump in oil prices. The only instance in
which stock prices fell in the absence of at least one of these
factors was in 1962, when the Kennedy administration pressured the
major steel producers to roll back large price increases, setting
off fears that the administration would pursue anti-business
policies.
Mutual Funds
Stock mutual funds continued to experience sizable inflows
through early March, although the recent volatility in the market
may have diminished somewhat the enthusiasm for equity investment.
Preliminary weekly data suggest that stock fund inflows, though
still positive, moderated during the week ended March 13--the week
including the sharp one-day market decline. Inflows to bond funds,
which had trended down over February and early March, turned
negative that week.

Various industry reports suggest that mutual fund investors
generally have long investment horizons. For their part, mutual
fund managers have been holding relatively small cash and short-term
securities positions, suggesting that they do not perceive
themselves to be particularly vulnerable to a surge in redemptions
(chart).l Indeed, in the weeks following the October 1987 stock
market break, investors redeemed less than 4 percent of their stock
fund holdings, and net outflows have been far smaller during other
periods of falling prices.
Money and Depository Credit
The strength in mutual fund inflows early this year does not
appear to have come at the expense of the broad monetary aggregates.
Spurred by the policy easings at the December and January FOMC
meetings, M2 and M3 growth picked up over the first two months of
the year. Moreover, preliminary data for March suggest a
considerable further acceleration of M2 and continued robust growth
in M3, placing them both further above the upper bounds of their
respective annual ranges. Much of the recent advance of the broad
aggregates has been fueled by growth in retail and institution-only
money funds. Money fund yields lag changes in short-term market
interest rates, thus making them particularly attractive investments
in the wake of System policy easings.
In contrast to the broad aggregates, M1 continued to contract
over the first two months of the year, with the impact of new retail
OCD "sweep" accounts far outweighing the impetus from narrowing
opportunity costs. More than $25 billion of OCD balances have been
swept just this year. Partial data suggest positive M1 growth in
1. Mutual fund managers face considerable competition from index
funds and so may be quite reluctant to sacrifice yield by holding
liquid assets--at least until the bull market trend is perceived to
have reversed. Another factor holding down liquidity ratios is that
many mutual funds maintain backup credit lines with banks to cover
emergency liquidity needs.

March, largely propelled by a surge in demand deposits. M1 could
get could get a further boost at the end of March with the
introduction of the new $100 bill: Overseas demand for the current
$100 bill reportedly has been weak in anticipation of the new bill.
The growth of bank credit slowed to a tepid 3-1/2 percent rate
in February (table) with a deceleration in loans more than
offsetting an uptick in securities. All major categories of bank
lending weakened in February, and preliminary data point toward
continued sluggish growth in March. Bank securities portfolios
expanded considerably in February, with much of the increase
concentrated at branches and agencies of foreign banks.
To an extent, the weakening in consumer lending in February
probably reflected a rapid pace of securitizations. Even adjusting
for securitizations, however, bank consumer loans expanded at a pace
well below that over much of last year. Although delinquency and
chargeoff rates for consumer loans have turned up in recent months,
the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated only a
slight tightening in lending standards for consumer loans.
Business loans expanded at a 6 percent pace in February--down
considerably from the previous month, but about in line with the
average growth over the final months of last year. The deceleration
in business loans has likely reflected moderation in demand, as
banks reportedly remain willing lenders and have been pricing loans
attractively. Indeed, the February Survey of Terms of Bank Lending
shows a narrowing of spreads over the federal funds rate on loans
larger than $100,000. The average spread on business loans has now
fallen to levels not seen since the mid-1980s (chart). Call Report
data for the fourth quarter of 1995 indicate that delinquency and
charge-off rates for C&I loans are at or near their lows for the
series (chart).

Growth of real estate loans dropped off in February, perhaps
slowed by securitizations of fixed rate mortgages originated in
recent months. Delinquency and charge-off rates on bank real estate
loans fell to record lows. The decline in the overall delinquency
rate of bank real estate loans was largely associated with
improvements in commercial mortgage loan performance. In contrast,
delinquency rates on single-family residential loans at banks edged
up over 1995.
With most measures of loan performance quite favorable, banks
remained highly profitable in the fourth quarter, pushing their
return on assets for the year to a level just short of the record
set in 1993 (chart). Low provisioning for loan losses, cuts in
deposit insurance premiums, and strong fee income helped buoy bank
profits last year. Given the ongoing cost cutting and consolidation
efforts in the industry, market participants appear to be looking
for another strong earnings year for banks in 1996. Overall, bank
stock prices have climbed substantially this year, generally
outpacing broad market averages.
Preliminary Call Report data for the fourth quarter indicate
savings associations expanded assets, albeit slightly, last year for
the first time since 1988 while their return on assets was
essentially unchanged from the previous year. Clouding the outlook
somewhat for thrifts is the gap in deposit insurance premiums
between BIF- and SAIF-insured institutions, which industry
representatives say is impairing their competitive position and
encouraging them to pursue nondeposit funding more aggressively.2
Both the FDIC and the Treasury have expressed concern that if
legislation to restructure SAIF is not enacted soon, large declines
2. Only slight evidence of these effects is evident in fourth-
quarter Call Report data. The incentives to pursue nondeposit
funding may have been held in check to some extent last year by the
expectation that Congress would resolve the premium disparity issue.

III-13
in the SAIF deposit base might ensue--leaving SAIF insurance
premiums insufficient to cover the interest on Financing Corporation
(FICO) bonds.
Business Finance
Public bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations remained
strong through mid-February as many firms took advantage of low
rates to lock in favorable long-term funding and pay down higher
cost debt. However, the backup in long-term rates since mid-
February has greatly depressed bond offerings. At the same time,
nonfinancial commercial paper has increased quite a bit in recent
weeks, fueled primarily by merger financing.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms picked up in
February and remained substantial through mid-March. Data on
registrations point to a continued hefty pace of issuance in the
near term. Initial public offerings have accounted for nearly one-
half of total nonfinancial equity issuance since the fourth quarter
of last year--an unusually high share--as many rapidly growing
companies have taken advantage of the funding opportunities provided
by the ebullient stock market.
Even with the pickup in total gross issuance, net issuance has
remained negative because of the continuing wave of equity
retirements. In addition to merger activity, share repurchase
programs have been a significant factor driving retirements of
equity shares. Firms undertaking repurchase programs have generally
been quite profitable, and they generate cash flow well in excess of
that needed to fund current capital expenditures and dividends
(chart). Many firms that have implemented repurchase programs have
also deployed excess funds to pare debt outstanding, leaving their
leverage ratios little changed on balance (chart).

Overall, nonfinancial business credit quality this year appears
to have slipped just a bit. The volume of credit rating downgrades
has exceeded upgrades by a small margin, and Moody's Watchlist of
potential actions includes many more new potential downgrades than
upgrades (chart). Utilities, facing changes in regulation and new
competition, and retailers, facing market saturation, have accounted
for all of the volume of downgraded debt and for nearly two-thirds
of the debt under review for a downgrade. In addition, ratings
actions this year have reflected the agencies' growing concern with
the debt service obligations implicit in some recent merger
transactions. Still, signs of deteriorating credit quality in the
nonfinancial business sector have not produced any notable market
reaction. Spreads of investment-grade bond yields over Treasuries
have changed little since year-end, while spreads in the junk bond
market, where defaults have been running below last year's pace,
have narrowed.
Treasury Finance
Secretary Rubin's decision to disinvest several government
trust funds for up to $19.9 billion, along with congressional
approval a $29 billion increase in the debt ceiling until March 15,
allowed the Treasury to hold normal coupon auctions in January and
February and to cover social security payments in early March. A
further temporary increase in the debt ceiling enacted earlier this
month allowed the Treasury to continue borrowing until March 29.
Longer-term solutions to the debt ceiling problem are currently
being considered by the Congress; one proposal recently approved by
both houses contains a longer-lasting debt limit extension tied to
provisions for a line item veto.

III-18
State and Local Government Finance
The general pattern of tax-exempt borrowing has paralleled that
in the nonfinancial business sector. Until mid-February, state and
local governments had been issuing substantial gross volumes of
long-term debt targeted, in part, to refund existing higher cost
debt. With the backup in long-term interest rates, refunding
volumes have diminished substantially. On net, debt continues to
contract as heavy retirements outpace new issues.

Yields on municipal bonds rose less than those on comparable

fading concerns over prospective "flat tax" reforms that might
affect the value of the tax-exemption for interest on municipal
bonds. In recent weeks, the ratio of tax-exempt to Treasury yields
on longer-term securities has backed up, possibly in response to the
growing backlog of issues that have been postponed since rates
climbed (chart).

In the fourth quarter, Standard and Poor's upgraded about $8
billion of debt and downgraded about $4 billion (chart), but for the
year as a whole, the dollar volume of downgrades exceeded upgrades
by a sizable margin. These rating actions reflected problems for a
few large cities and counties and the utility sector, but have not
affected the bulk of state and local issuers. Quality spreads on
long-term municipal debt have remained rather narrow since the
beginning of 1995.
Mortgage Markets
Data on mortgage lending in the current quarter suggest that
credit growth may have slowed a little. Consistent with the backup
in mortgage rates, the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of loan
applications for home purchases in the first quarter is running
about 8 percent below the fourth quarter of last year (chart). The
refinancing index also has declined sharply and is likely to show
further weakness in coming reports. Partial first-quarter data for
securitized mortgage credit reveal a continued climb in gross
issuance of mortgage-backed securities, evidently fueled by the
large share of fixed rate mortgage originations in recent months
(chart). Most new issuance has been in the form of pass-through
securities, but the CMO market--which had been moribund until very
recently--has shown some stirrings with an appreciable pickup in
issuance this year.
The MBA's broadest measure of home mortgage delinquency rates
was about unchanged in the fourth quarter at 4.25 percent. The
average delinquency rate on loans thirty days or more past due rose
9 basis points, to 2.95 percent (chart). By contrast, the average
delinquency rate on mortgages sixty days or more past due was
unchanged last quarter, while delinquency rates on loans ninety days
or more past due moved down 8 basis points.

Several trade reports indicate that mortgage credit quality
problems have been concentrated in loans originated in recent years.
For example, an analysis of 25 million to 30 million loans across
thirty-five states by Mortgage Research Group--a New Jersey-based
market research firm--indicates that mortgages originated in 1994
and 1995 are experiencing much higher rates of foreclosure than more
seasoned loans. Moreover, compared with loans originated in 1992
and 1993, default rates on the newer mortgages have reached levels
in only a few months after closing that typically are not observed
until after a few years of seasoning. The upward trend in default
rates and foreclosures is evident in all regions of the country, but
the incidence is greatest in the West, where real estate prices in
many states have remained depressed.
To some extent, the poorer performance of recently originated
loans is consistent with the reported easings of lending standards
by mortgage bankers in recent years. Not surprisingly, for example,
both lenders and mortgage insurers have begun to report that loans
originated in the past two years under special "affordable" home
loan programs have performed especially poorly.3
Consumer Credit
Consumer installment credit continued to exhibit brisk growth
in January, increasing at a 12 percent seasonally adjusted annual
rate after an upward-revised 11-1/2 percent gain in December
(table). Nevertheless, over the past few months, the pace of
consumer credit growth appears to have slowed a notch from that
reached in 1994 and early last year (chart). Slowing growth in
February at commercial banks, which account for nearly half of total
3. Affordable housing loans refer to those loans underwritten
using more lenient standards for certain key risk factors, including
loan-to-value ratios, required cash reserves, debt-to-income ratios,
and credit histories.

outstandings, suggests that the gradual deceleration may have
continued in February as well.
A broad-based but modest rise in delinquency rates on consumer
loans occurred in the fourth quarter. Credit card delinquency
rates--calculated from the Call Report data--rose each quarter in
1995, approaching 4 percent in the fourth quarter from a low of 3.3
percent in the second half of 1994 (chart). Even at 4 percent,
however, credit card delinquency rates were still well below the
most recent peaks in 1991. The American Bankers Association (ABA)
reported a small increase in credit card delinquencies for the
fourth quarter. After rising sharply in the final quarter of 1994
and the first quarter of 1995, this series rose only marginally over
the rest of last year. The ABA recorded moderate increases in
delinquencies on closed end loans throughout the year; nevertheless,
this series is still much closer to its lows than its highs of the
past twenty years.
Delinquencies on auto loans at the captive finance companies
are at historically levels, but may be leveling off after rising
steadily for two years. (Readings on delinquency rates in January
and February are at about the same level as in the fourth quarter of
last year.) According to a credit manager at one company, the climb
in delinquency rates was an expected side-effect of efforts to sell
cars by liberalizing lending standards. Delinquency rates at
captive finance companies have also been boosted a bit by the shift
away from loans toward leasing in recent years; performance data for
leases are not included in the loan delinquency rate and lease
customers have tended to be better-than-average credit risks.
The upturn in consumer loan delinquency rates is consistent
with the recent climb in personal bankruptcies over the past few
quarters (chart). This increase no doubt reflects in part the rise

in debt payment problems but also importantly an increased
likelihood for individuals to declare bankruptcy as a means of
dealing with financial strains. Some changes in federal bankruptcy
law effective last year--principally an increase in the dollar
amount of assets that can be exempted from liquidation--likely made
bankruptcy more attractive to troubled debtors.
Despite these signs of deterioration in consumer
creditworthiness, interest rates on consumer loans declined in the
opening months of this year. The average most common rate on a
forty-eight-month new-car loan at banks was 9.1 percent in the
Board's quarterly survey taken in early February, down from 9.4
percent in November and the recent high of 9.8 percent last May.
Average new-car rates have dropped more sharply at the auto finance
companies, from 12 percent last March to 9.7 percent in January.
This drop stems partly from the effect of special reduced-rate
financing programs subsidized by the manufacturing parent companies.

In the fourth quarter, the deficit narrowed to a level last
recorded in the first quarter of 1994. Exports were 2.2 percent
higher than in the third quarter with the largest increases recorded
in machinery (a wide range of products) and services (particularly
receipts from foreigners' travel and transportation expenditures in
the United States). Imports declined 0.5 percent, with decreases
recorded largely in automotive products, consumer goods, and oil.
Imports of non-oil industrial supplies and machinery other than
computers and semiconductors declined as well.
The trade deficit for 1995 was only slightly larger than in
the previous year. This followed two years of substantial increases
in the deficit. In price-adjusted dollars, a distinct downturn
appeared during the second half of 1995 in imports of consumer
goods, automotive products, non-oil industrial supplies (especially

metals), and capital goods (other than computers and semi-
conductors). All of these categories had been on an upward
trajectory through early 1995. Exports trended upward during the
year (although at a slower rate than a year earlier). Most of the
increase was in capital goods (even when computers and semi-
conductors are excluded) and industrial supplies. Capital goods
and industrial supplies together account for nearly 70 percent of
the nominal value of merchandise exports.
Oil Imports
The quantity of oil imported during November-December declined
slightly from October rates. The large seasonal inventory drawdown
offset increases in oil consumption. Preliminary Department of
Energy statistics indicate that in January-February imports should
fall due to a continued drawdown in oil inventories.
The price of imported oil rose slightly in November, and then
accelerated in December and January resulting in a price level 10
percent above that of January 1995. Spot WTI rose nearly $0.20 per
barrel in February, averaging $19.07 per barrel, roughly unchanged
from its average in December. Prices have risen during March and
are trading in the $20.00 per barrel range. Unusually cold weather
in North America and Japan as well as weather-related production
disruptions in the North Sea and Australia helped keep prices firm.
Prices have also been more volatile -- spot WTI jumped to $23 per
barrel in intraday trading on February 20 -- with inventories
reported to be at very low levels. Refiners have been reluctant to
build inventories because of the fear of a sharp price decline if
negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations for a limited oil
sale result in an additional 700,000 barrels per day of oil on world
markets.

Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased in January. The
largest declines were in food prices. In addition, there were
smaller price decreases in most other major trade categories. For
the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, prices of non-
oil imports declined 1 percent at an annual rate; this followed ten
consecutive quarters of price increases. The largest declines were
in capital goods and foods. In addition, the rate of increase in
prices of imported industrial supplies slowed to near zero in Q4
from double-digit rates in the first two quarters of the year. Data
for February are scheduled to be released on March 26.
Prices of exports increased in January, the largest rise since
April 1995. Overall, prices of exports have changed very little
since mid-1995; prices of exported agricultural products have risen
sharply and (until January) prices of other exported products have
declined. Much of the increase in the price of total exports in
January was accounted for by agricultural commodities; agricultural
export prices have risen at double-digit annual rates since the
first quarter of 1995 in response to disappointing harvests abroad
last year and robust world demand. The price of nonagricultural
exports rose moderately in January--the first monthly increase since
last June. Since mid-1994, movements in nonagricultural export
prices have been dominated by sharp swings in the prices of exported
industrial supplies, including a runup through mid-1995, a reversal
during the third and fourth quarters of last year, and a pickup in
January.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit narrowed $36.7 billion SAAR
in the fourth quarter. The largest changes were reductions in the
deficits in trade (discussed above) and in investment income.
The deficit on investment income narrowed $14.5 billion SAAR
in the fourth quarter. This change was more than accounted for by
the increase in net direct investment income. Earnings of U.S.
direct investors abroad improved dramatically, by over $10 billion
SAAR, lead by the performance of the computer industry; profits of
foreign direct investors in the United States fell marginally, in
line with anecdotal reports of a weakening of corporate profits in
the U.S. domestic economy.
For the year 1995, the current account deficit was virtually
unchanged from 1994.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States continued
to increase sharply in January, after a record $109 billion increase
in 1995. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.) Much of the increase in January was accounted
for by a wide range of developing countries in Asia and Latin
America. Partial data for February from FRBNY indicate continued
increases by developing countries as well as large increases by G-10
countries associated with foreign exchange market intervention.
Net purchases of U.S. corporate and government agency bonds by
private foreigners were strong in January (see line 4b). Both U.S.
financial corporations and government agencies have been actively
issuing bonds in global markets in the first quarter. Some of these
issues have been in exotic currencies (for example, South African
rand, Egyptian pound, Polish zloty, and Portuguese escudo), probably
to hedge exposure or to take advantage of swap opportunities.
Net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities by private
foreigners were modest in January, held down by very large net sales
by financial institutions located in the Caribbean (line 4a). For
1995, Caribbean financial centers accounted for almost 40 percent of
the record $100 billion in foreign private net purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities. Part of the funding to finance these purchases
appears to have come from RP transactions with nonbank securities
dealers located in the United States, contributing to the outflow
reported in line 3. Net purchases of Treasury securities by
residents of Japan directly from the United States were also
substantial in 1995 and in January 1996.
Foreigners continued to add to their holdings of U.S.
corporate stock in January (line 4c). For the fourth quarter of
1995, BEA has added an estimate of stock acquired through a merger-

related stock swap (discussed below) to the reported data, bringing
BEA's published total for the year 1995 to $12.8 billion.
After a weak first quarter in 1995, U.S. net purchases of
foreign securities were very strong; that strength continued in
January 1996 (line 5). Stock purchases were concentrated in the
industrial countries. Net purchases of stocks in Japan were
particularly strong in January, accounting for 57 percent of the
total, up from 40 percent for 1995. In contrast, since the Mexican
crisis U.S. investors have shown limited interest in adding to their
holdings of stocks or bonds from developing countries in Latin
America. Interest in stocks from developing countries in Asia was
better maintained.
Data recently released by the Department of Commerce indicate
that direct investment inflows and outflows rose to record levels in
1995 (lines 6 and 7). Large mergers and acquisitions added
substantially to the flows in both directions; examples include the
takeover of Marion Merrell Dow by Hoechst and the merger of
Pharmacia and Upjohn. The latter deal, because of the way it was
structured (a stock swap with the new merged firm incorporated in
Delaware), increased U.S. direct investment abroad, but this
increase was balanced by an increase in foreign holdings of U.S.
stock and an increase in foreign direct investment in the United
States. In addition, privatizations abroad attracted large
investments by U.S. firms. In contrast to U.S. portfolio
investment, direct investment outflows to Latin America continued to
grow in 1995, as did U.S. direct investment flows to developing
countries in Asia.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the FOMC meeting on January 31, the exchange value of
the dollar depreciated 1/4 percent against the yen, 3/4 percent
against the mark, and 1-3/4 percent against sterling. On a
weighted-average basis, the dollar declined 1-1/4 percent.
In the first half of the intermeeting period the dollar
declined amid changing market expectations about the future course
of German and Japanese monetary policies. In Germany, stronger-than-
expected growth in the M3 money supply and in industrial production
may have led some market participants to conclude that the
Bundesbank's easing cycle had ended. This perception was reinforced
by the Bundesbank's announcement on February 1 that it would conduct
repurchase operations at a fixed rate of 3.30 percent at the tenders
on February 7 and 14. (The Bundesbank announced on March 14 that
the repo rate will remain fixed at 3.30 percent through March 27.)
In Japan, data releases that generally were stronger than expected
suggested that monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan may soon be
at hand. This perception was reinforced by ill-timed official
comments that pensioners were suffering from low interest rates.
However, in late February, the dollar rebounded due to a
number of factors. First, incoming data suggested that economic
prospects in Germany and Japan were not as rosy as earlier data had
indicated, while economic data in the United States generally were
stronger than expected. In Germany, business confidence dipped in
January, and the strong growth in industrial production that was
registered in December was revised sharply downward. Although the
Japanese Tankan survey continued to climb from lows recorded in late
1993, the rise in February was not as strong as the market had
expected. Second, accommodative money market operations by the Bank
of Japan have signalled that monetary tightening is not imminent.

Third, the dollar may have been supported by very heavy intervention
purchases by the Bank of Japan.
Except in France, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, short-term
interest rates are little changed on net since the last FOMC meeting
as monetary policy has remained on hold in most G-10 countries. The
Bank of France reduced its intervention rate, the effective floor
for short-term market interest rates, by a cumulative amount of
40 basis points as the French franc strengthened somewhat against
the mark. Citing subdued inflation pressure and below-trend growth,
the Bank of England reduced official rates by 1/4 percentage point
on March 8. In Sweden, the Riksbank lowered its repo rate by
85 basis points cumulatively as downward pressure on the krona,
which followed market concerns that the government was wavering in
its commitment to fiscal austerity, has subsided, and incoming
inflation data was quite favorable. On March 21, the Riksbank
reduced its official interest rates by 3/4 percentage point, and the
Bank of Canada lowered its target range for the overnight rate by
1/4 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent.
Long-term interest rates in most G-10 countries rose over the
intermeeting period. Although the increase in U.S. long-term rates
is consistent with stronger-than-expected data, the backup in long-
term rates in some other G-10 countries, particularly in most
European countries where recent data releases generally have been
weaker than expected, is more difficult to explain. The rise in
long-term rates in most European countries may reflect market
perceptions that monetary easing in Germany, and by extension in
most other European countries, has, or will soon, come to an end as
faster growth in the United States and Canada may herald strength in
other countries. Higher European long-term rates may also reflect
market concerns that relaxation of the Maastricht fiscal convergence
criteria, in order to begin EMU as scheduled in 1999, may lead to

IV-15
higher long-run debt positions and, perhaps, inflation in those
countries. In Japan, long-term interest rates rose earlier in the
intermeeting period, but declined after the release of the weaker-
than-expected Tankan survey on March 1, and are about unchanged on
balance.
In Mexican financial markets, the peso declined 1-1/2 percent
against the dollar over the intermeeting period. The Mexican stock
market declined by as much as 7 percent as interest rates on peso-
denominated cetes obligations rose early in the intermeeting period
due to heightened inflationary concerns. However, in recent days,
interest rates have reversed direction, and the stock market has
rallied. On balance, one-month interest rates are up 2 percentage
points, but 1-year interest rates are down 1/2 percentage point,
since the last FOMC meeting. The Mexican stock market is 1 percent
lower on balance since January 31.
The Desk did not intervene in foreign exchange markets over
the intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity remained sluggish late last year on balance,
as real GDP contracted or registered little growth in many major
foreign industrial countries. An exception was Japan, where growth
picked up significantly, and a moderate recovery appears underway.
Indicators for the current quarter are limited, but point to
continued moderate growth in Japan, and incoming data suggest that
activity has picked up in Canada. In contrast, activity still
appears to be weak in Germany and France, while indicators for the
United Kingdom and Italy have been mixed.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. Prices have fallen
further in Japan, and recent consumer price inflation has averaged

IV-16
2 percent or less in Germany, France, and Canada. Italian inflation
remains high but has slowed considerably in the past couple of
months. U.K. consumer price inflation has been moderate, while
producer price inflation has trended downward.
Individual country notes. In Japan, recently released fourth-
quarter data and revised third-quarter data show sustained moderate
output growth. This growth has been led by large increases in
public and private investment and moderate increases in private
consumption. In the fourth quarter, government investment accounted
for half of the increase in total fixed investment. Net exports
have been a significant drag on growth, reflecting the lagged effect
of yen appreciation in early 1995.

In the Bank of Japan's February survey (Tankan), the index of
business sentiment of major manufacturing firms (the percentage

with an unfavorable outlook) registered -12, slightly less negative
than the previous survey taken in November.
The current account surplus has continued to decline,
registering about $110 billion for the year 1995, down about $19
billion from the previous year. The current account surplus
declined again in January, and trade data for February show a
further decline in the merchandise trade surplus.
For nearly three weeks, the opposition New Frontier Party has
blockaded the entrance to the Budget Committee room and prevented
the Diet from considering the FY1996 budget. This blockade is in
protest to the budget's allocation of ¥685 billion ($6.4 billion) of
public funds to help resolve the problem of insolvent housing loan
companies (jusen). The government plans to introduce a provisional
budget for the first few weeks of the fiscal year that does not

IV-18
include money for the jusen while it tries to negotiate with the
opposition parties on the regular budget.
In Germany, real GDP contracted 1.6 percent (SAAR) during the
final quarter of 1995. The softening of the economy in 1995
reflects a slowdown in domestic demand, despite a pickup in private
consumption spending (to rates slightly below those typical of an
expansion). Growth in investment declined in 1995, as construction
dropped sharply with the expiration of assorted tax incentives at
the end of 1994 that had accelerated building plans and, more
recently, from the very cold winter, while spending on machinery and
equipment was little changed. Data for the fourth quarter indicate
a sizable inventory correction, which could bode well for current
quarter production. However, since inventories are not measured
independently in the German statistics but are the residual in the
national accounts, inferences from the fourth quarter inventory
drawdown could be misleading.

Data for the first quarter are generally consistent with
continued weakness. Unemployment has increased further, rising by
107,000 persons (seasonally adjusted) in February to bring the total
number of unemployment to nearly 4 million. Rising uncertainty
about job prospects may be causing consumers to save the court-
mandated tax cuts that went into effect on January 1 and were widely
expected to generate a pickup in private consumption. A survey of
current and expected conditions in the construction sector showed
further declines. However, industrial output was up sharply in
January, and export expectations of manufacturing firms rose
strongly.
Price pressures remain modest. Over the 12 months ending in
February, consumer prices in the western states rose 1.4 percent.
Producer and import prices continue to evidence no sign of
inflationary pressures, with the most recent monthly data showing
declines on a 12-month basis.

As of March 15, the Finance Ministry began requiring special
approval for large federal expenditures, in hopes of reducing the
1996 deficit overrun now estimated to be in the range of DM 15-20
billion. A similar measure was instituted last October when it
became clear that tax revenues were likely to fall short of
expectations. This emergency measure does not rule out a
supplementary budget later this year or the possible institution of
additional tax measures in order to meet the federal deficit target
of DM 60 billion.
In France, real GDP contracted 1.3 percent (SAAR) in the
fourth quarter. This contraction was in line with expectations, and
was attributed in part to the public sector strikes in late November
and December. During the fourth quarter, private consumption
declined and inventories fell sharply while investment, government
spending, and net exports contributed positively to growth.

Monthly indicators suggest that economic activity will remain
subdued in the current quarter, after factoring in some bounceback

IV-21
in production following the strike. Although business surveys
suggest that confidence has stabilized early this year, output is
expected to remain weak through the first quarter. The surveys also
suggest that inventories remain above normal, pointing to a
continued inventory correction in the near-term, and the
unemployment rate rose further in January to 11.8 percent. Real
consumption of manufactured products rose sharply in January from
its fourth-quarter average, but at least part of this pickup stems
from a strike-rebound effect. Consumer confidence in January and
February improved modestly from December but remains far below last
summer's levels. Consumer price inflation remained moderate through
February.

Available data for the current quarter are mixed. While
manufacturing output increased 0.3 percent in January, overall
industrial production contracted, reflecting weather-related
weakness in the utility sector. In February, manufacturing
employment declined somewhat. However, retail sales rebounded in
February, and the February Confederation of British Industry survey
showed the balance of firms expecting to increase output versus
those expecting to decrease output rose to +20 from the December low
of +2.
Targeted inflation, measured as the year-on-year change in
retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, has been little
changed through February from the fourth quarter average of 2.9
percent. A declining trend in price pressures has been more visible
in producer price indexes. Growth in average earnings continues to
be modest despite a gradually falling unemployment rate. Surveys on
pay settlements show that most were settled in the 3 to 4 percentSAAR)1

In Italy, the advance GDP release stated that real economic
activity declined 4 percent (SAAR) in the fourth quarter, following
an 8 percent gain in the third quarter. Large swings in inventory
investment have been primarily responsible for quarter-to-quarter
movements in GDP this year. The preliminary Q4 release implies that
for 1995 as a whole, real GDP expanded 2.4 percent on a Q4/Q4 basis,
largely the result of strong export growth. Forward-looking
indicators are limited. Business sentiment picked up considerably
in December and January, but consumer confidence edged down in
February and remains below levels registered in mid-1995.
Inflation has continued to decline. In February, the consumer
price index was 5 percent above its year-earlier level, down from a
peak of 6.1 percent in December. Wholesale price inflation has also
slowed somewhat.
On February 16, President Scalfaro dissolved the parliament

majority. If the election does not produce a strong majority,
prospects for further fiscal reform could be jeopardized.

Economic activity in Canada remained weak in the fourth
quarter of 1995, as real GDP expanded 0.8 percent (SAAR). Machinery
and equipment investment picked up sharply, reversing a drop in the
third quarter, but this increase was partially offset by further
declines in residential and non-residential construction. Net
exports contributed positively to growth, despite the weak pace of
activity in the United States. A drop in consumption expenditures,
a reduced pace of inventory investment, and lower government
spending also contributed to the quarter's sluggish pace.

Recent indicators are limited but suggest a pickup in economic
activity. In January, retail sales rose and manufacturing shipments
edged up, while new factory orders through January have posted three
consecutive monthly increases. Conditions in the labor market have
also improved recently. Between November 1995 and February 1996,
employment has grown 1 percent, more than three times the increase
over the previous twelve months. However, the unemployment rate
remained high at 9.6 percent in February, as recent job growth has
led to increased labor force participation.
After rising to near the top of the Bank of Canada's 1-3
percent target band in the first half of last year, consumer price
inflation has been subdued recently, reflecting the excess supply in
the economy, stabilization of the Canadian dollar, and moderation in
industrial product price inflation.
The Chretien government's new budget, released on March 6,
calls for continued significant reductions in government spending to
reduce the deficit from 4 percent of GDP for the fiscal year ending
March 31, to 3 percent of GDP in 1996-97 and to 2 percent of GDP in

IV-26
1997-98. A sizable operating surplus will continue to be offset by
rising debt service costs. The federal government net debt-to-GDP
ratio is expected to peak at nearly 75 percent of GDP this year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, real GDP growth rebounded moderately in the
fourth quarter of 1995 from generally sharp declines earlier in the
year, while inflation continued to move lower, except in Venezuela.
Asian real GDP growth slowed a bit to more sustainable rates. Trade
performance continued to be stronger in Latin America compared with
a year earlier. In contrast, the Chinese trade balance moved toward
a deficit.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, recent data suggest that
the recession bottomed out in mid-1995. Fourth-quarter real GDP
declined 6.6 percent from its year-earlier level, bringing GDP for
all of 1995 to 6.9 percent below its 1994 level, the steepest
decline in the post-war period. However, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, GDP is estimated to have increased about 3.7 percent (not at
an annual rate) in the fourth quarter after rising 1.3 percent in
the third quarter. The fourth-quarter increase was considerably
greater than expected and, in contrast to previous quarters,
reflected a rebound in domestic demand while net exports weakened.
However, much of the increase in domestic demand was attributable to
a reduced pace of inventory decumulation rather than a rebound in
final demand. The rebound in GDP was mirrored in a strengthening of
industrial production in November and December, as well as in the
steady decline in the unemployment rate. On a seasonally adjusted
basis, the unemployment rate is estimated to have declined further
in January and February, suggesting that economic activity may have
continued to expand early this year.
Seasonal factors help to explain the rise in December and
January inflation rates. The reduction in the inflation rate to 2.3
percent in February, as well as the recent stabilization of the peso
and an easing of seasonal price pressures, suggest that inflation
will decline on balance in the coming months.

IV-30
Largely as a result of an improved trade performance, the
current account deficit declined to only about $650 million in 1995
compared with a $29 billion deficit in 1994. More recently, the
merchandise trade surplus rose sharply in January, in part reversing
monthly declines registered in the fourth quarter of last year.

Partly as a result of the intensification of financial market
pressures late last year, past-due loans as a share of total loans
rose from 9 percent at end-1994 to about 18 percent in December. In
February, it was announced that the Bank of Montreal would be
purchasing a significant ownership share in Bancomer, Mexico's
second largest bank, while the Bank of Nova Scotia would be
acquiring a majority stake in Inverlat. The recapitalization of
these banks will be supported by government purchases of their loan
portfolios.
In Brazil, real GDP in the fourth quarter of 1995 rebounded
partially from its steep decline in the second and third quarters,
bringing growth for the year as a whole to 4.2 percent (largely
reflecting very strong growth in the fourth quarter of 1994 and the
first quarter of 1995). Indications are that economic activity

IV-31
continued its recovery in the first quarter of 1996. By Brazilian
standards, inflation remains relatively low.

Despite the pickup in economic activity, Brazil recorded
balanced trade in January and February 1996, as it did in the fourth
quarter of 1995. Strong net capital inflows prompted the central
bank in early February to tighten capital controls. The inflows
occurred as domestic interest rates remained high relative to the
rate of depreciation allowed by the central bank under the crawling
peg. In January 1996, international reserves were an estimated
$54 billion (liquidity definition), up considerably from a low of
$32 billion in early 1995.
Top central bank and government officials have come under fire
from Congress over revelations that a large private bank, which ran
into financial trouble in late 1995 and was rescued by the central
bank at a heavy cost, had hidden its losses by engaging in
fraudulent banking practices for a decade. Some observers have
expressed concerns that a Senate inquiry into the matter could
reveal more evidence of banking irregularities and further weaken
confidence in the banking system.
In Argentina, real GDP contracted by an estimated 3.5 percent
in 1995, while inflation remained low. Consumer prices rose

IV-32
0.4 percent in February from a year earlier. In 1995, exports
rose by 31 percent over a year earlier, while imports declined
almost 9 percent. However, the trade surplus peaked in June. Gross
international reserves have increased somewhat in the last month
and stood at $19 billion at end-February. Of the $19 billion,
$2.6 billion are in dollar-denominated Bonex bonds and $3.4 billion
are in net repurchase agreements. The monetary base was
$12 billion, leaving $7 billion in excess reserves.

October of each year. The
Argentina's current Extended Fund Facility arrangement with
the IMF expires on March 30, 1996. In mid-February, Argentina
reached a preliminary agreement on a new 21-month stand-by
arrangement with the IMF, with the amount due to be fixed in the
first half of April, although it is likely to be for about
$1 billion. The package of laws intended to give President Menem
power for one year to raise taxes and cut some spending without
Congressional approval was passed, slightly amended, by the Senate
on February 29. The "Reform of the State II" law, as it is called,
is expected to be passed shortly by the lower house of Congress.
In Venezuela, real GDP grew an estimated 2 percent in 1995,
due to the strong performance of the oil sector, which grew

IV-33
6 percent. Economic activity in the non-oil sector continued to
decline, contributing to rising unemployment, which was above
10 percent at the end of 1995. Consumer price inflation picked up
in December due to the devaluation of the bolivar that month and has
reached 8 percent a month in both January and February. Venezuela
registered a merchandise (non-oil) trade deficit of $5.6 billion for
the first eleven months of 1995, versus a deficit of $3.6 billion
during the same period in 1994, reflecting a 37 percent increase in
imports and a 16 percent increase in exports.

trade deficit of $0.5 billion in the January-February period
compares with a surplus of $4.5 billion in the same period of 1995.
The dollar value of exports fell 2 percent from a year earlier,

In February 1996, China announced plans to liberalize access
to the interbank foreign exchange market. The new regulations,
effective April 1, 1996, eliminate the existing segmented markets
for Chinese and foreign enterprises. Chinese officials suggest that
full current-account convertibility will be achieved by the year
2000. China has no plans, however, to ease restrictions on capital-
account transactions.
In Taiwan, real GDP growth slowed to 4.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1995 from the year-earlier period, in part reflecting
sluggish consumption growth. For 1995 overall, real GDP grew at its
lowest rate since 1990 and its second lowest rate since 1984. M2
rose 8 percent in the twelve-months ending in January 1996, the
lowest annual growth rate since Taiwan began recording monetary
statistics. The slow growth in monetary aggregates in part reflects
capital outflows, as foreign exchange reserves fell to $90 billion
at the end of 1995 from its high of $100 billion in June 1995,
reflecting increased tensions with China. Reserves fell further in
early 1996, to an estimated $85 billion in early March.

The approach of Taiwan's first direct presidential election on
March 23 has led to rising tension with mainland China, which in
turn has been reflected in financial markets. Taiwan's stock market
fell 28 percent in 1995 and has fallen 5 percent so far this year.
In an attempt to support the stock market, Taiwan in February

IV-35
announced a new $7 billion stock-market stabilization fund, using
contributions from banks, insurance companies, postal funds, and
pension funds. In addition, Taiwan announced that it was opening
the stock market to foreign individual investors; previously, only
foreign institutional investors were permitted.
In Korea, activity appears to have slowed somewhat in recent
months, compared with the nearly double-digit growth experienced in
the first three quarters of 1995. However, it is difficult to gauge
the magnitude of the slowdown. An abrupt deceleration in capital
goods imports since the middle of last year suggests that investment
demand has slowed markedly. On the other hand, industrial
production increased sharply in January (on a year-over-year basis),
after decelerating significantly in the fourth quarter of 1995.
Consumer price inflation was 5.1 percent in February 1996 (on a
year-over-year basis).

Korea recently announced that it will raise the ceiling on
foreign participation in its stock market from its present limit of
15 percent of market capitalization to 20 percent by the second half
of this year. It also announced measures that will allow increased
foreign competition in the provision of financial services,
including allowing foreign securities firms to conduct brokerage
operations on outbound portfolio investment. These steps were

IV-36
announced to enhance Korea's prospects of gaining admission to the
OECD. Korea's application will be reviewed formally in April.
In Russia, monthly inflation fell to a post-reform low of
2.8 percent in February, down from 4.1 percent in January. The
ruble has continued to depreciate slowly against the dollar,
remaining comfortably within its 4550-5150 rubles per dollar band.
During February, real GDP was down 3 percent from a year earlier,
and industrial production declined by 4 percent. Russia's trade
surplus increased to $17.9 billion in 1995, as exports increased by
13 percent and imports grew by 10 percent.

In late February, the IMF and the Russian government reached
agreement on a three-year $10.2 billion equivalent Extended Fund
Facility (EFF), as a successor to the stand-by arrangement that
Russia successfully completed in early February. The conditions of
the EFF focus on increased fiscal discipline, including a pledge to
reduce the budget deficit from 5 percent of GDP in 1995 to 4 percent
of GDP in 1996 and 2 percent of GDP in 1998. The structural reforms
outlined in the agreement include tax reform (particularly improved
revenue collection), trade liberalization, further privatization,
and intensified efforts to strengthen bank supervision and
regulation.
