created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Fueled by hefty gains in household and business expenditures,
the economy turned in a solid growth performance in the first
quarter. Progress in clearing up inventory overhangs--most notably
in the auto industry--appears to have set the stage for further
expansion of aggregate output in the current quarter. Although
tight labor market conditions have aroused concerns about possible
pay acceleration, incoming data have not revealed much movement to
date; producer and consumer prices have registered larger increases
in the past couple of months, but that development has mainly
reflected a jump in crude oil prices that has already been largely
reversed.
GDP Update
On May 2, the BEA issued its advance estimate of first-quarter
GDP growth: 2.8 percent at an annual rate. Source data that have
become available since that time have been somewhat weaker on
balance than assumed--but the shortfall is the result of lower
inventory investment, which might be interpreted as a plus for
subsequent growth. Further changes to the estimate of first-quarter
growth may still be forthcoming, of course, as additional source
data trickle in over coming weeks. A potentially important item is
the March report on international trade, which will be released on
May 17.

quarter; payroll employment held steady, and aggregate hours of
production and nonsupervisory workers declined. However, part of
the slackening last month represented a reversal of special factors
that had helped boost employment in the first quarter, and other
indicators, most notably claims for unemployment compensation, do
not suggest any recent softening in the growth of labor demand. For
these reasons, we are inclined to think that the April reading
understates the current trend of employment growth--just as the
earlier reports seem to have overstated it to a considerable degree.
Increased hiring in the service-producing industries has more
than accounted for the gains in payrolls this year. Employment in
retail trade has moved up 30,000 a month for the year to date, while
net job gains in service industries have averaged almost 100,000.
In the goods-producing sector, construction employment fell sharply
in April, reversing 40 percent of its first-quarter gain; the month-
to-month variations in payrolls this year evidently have reflected
the disruption of normal seasonal patterns by unusual weather. On
average, employment in construction has risen 20,000 per month in
1996. In contrast, manufacturers have continued to shed jobs this
year. After accounting for the return of GM workers from the strike
in Dayton, Ohio and from strike-related furloughs, manufacturing
employment dropped about 50,000 in April. Since the beginning of
the year, it has fallen 120,000--a faster contraction than occurred
in 1995. Nondurable goods industries have accounted for nearly
75 percent of this year's decline, with the textile and apparel
industries being notably weak.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers in
private industry fell 0.5 percent in April but have grown
0.8 percent--or about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate--thus far in
1996. The official series on aggregate hours shows April's level
about 1/2 percentage point above the average for the first quarter
(not at an annual rate). However, the first-quarter average was
depressed by the low reading on hours during the January reference
week, which was the week of the blizzard and therefore not
representative of the month as a whole. Making some reasonable
guesses about what aggregate hours in January might really have
been, we estimate that hours in April actually were a shade lower
than the average for the first quarter.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate fell
0.2 percentage point in April to 5.4 percent, touching once more the

lower end of the range in which it has fluctuated since October
1994. The labor force participation rate, which has shown
significant volatility recently, dropped 0.3 percentage point to
66.6 percent, its average level in both 1994 and 1995.1
Other labor market indicators seem to be holding on paths that
are consistent with moderate economic expansion. Initial claims for
unemployment insurance under state programs averaged 353.000 in the
most recent four weeks, a level in the lower part of the range of
the past year. The Conference Board Help Wanted Index showed a
small uptick in March after falling in both January and February.
In the Conference Board consumer confidence survey for April,
respondents reported greater optimism about job availability;
compared with the results of the March survey, fewer respondents
perceived that jobs are hard to get, and more believed job
opportunities to be plentiful.
Industrial Production
Monthly changes in industrial production were exceptionally
volatile over the first several months of 1996, with the blizzard
inducing sharp monthly swings in the data for January and February
and the strike in the auto sector and its subsequent settlement
causing a second swing in March and April. On balance, these
monthly swings resulted in a rise in production of 1.4 percent from
December to April--a net change that was elevated by a few tenths
because of strike effects.
Most of the 0.9 percent increase in industrial production in
April reflected the rebound in motor vehicle assemblies. The April
level of assemblies--12.2 million units at an annual rate--was
0.5 million units above planned output at the beginning of the
month; the upward adjustment occurred at GM as the firm tried to
make up for some of the output that was lost during the strike.
Effects of the strike, coupled with stronger-than-expected sales,
helped reduce the days' supply of automobiles from the high levels
prevailing during most of 1995 to levels a bit below those the
industry normally considers comfortable. As a result, the
industry's plans for second-quarter assemblies of automobiles were
recently revised up; even so, production capacity limits are
1. Using concurrent seasonal factors, which are updated each
month rather than at the end of each year, the unemployment rate and
participation rate each fell only 0.1 percentage point, to
5.5 percent and 66.6 percent respectively.

e Estimated.
Current and prospective indicators of industrial activity more
broadly have been mixed; on the whole, however, they appear to point
to sustained expansion of production. New orders for durable goods,
adjusted for inflation and excluding orders that are not closely
related to near-term activity, fell 0.9 percent in March, but this
decline reversed only about half of the sizable rise reported over
the two previous months. The orders and production components of
the National Purchasing Managers' indexes firmed in April, though
they were at levels suggesting only slow expansion of the
manufacturing sector in the near term. An increasingly positive
element in the outlook is that aircraft production is swinging back
in a positive direction. Schedules for Boeing, which produces the
vast majority of domestic commercial jet aircraft, suggest that
total commercial jet aircraft production will increase about 40
percent over this year and the next, after posting large declines in
1994-95.
The 1995 estimates of capacity growth in manufacturing have
been revised downward slightly and those for 1996 revised upward in
response to new information from the Investment Plans Survey and
more detailed, revised utilization rates from the Census Survey of
Plant Capacity for 1993 and 1994. The revised estimates still show
sizable gains in factory productive potential in 1995-96--on the
order of 4 percent; increases have been particularly large in the
computer and semiconductor industries. Utilization rates for the
total industrial sector have been fluctuating with the monthly ups
and downs in production; the rate in April, 83.0 percent, was

slightly to the high side of the long-run average. The rate in
primary processing industries has continued to look stronger than
that in the advanced processing industries.
Personal Income and Consumption
After a sluggish fourth quarter, consumer demand has displayed
renewed vitality. Real expenditures rose briskly in the first
quarter, income growth has been well-maintained, and sentiment is
positive. Although loan delinquencies have become more numerous,
households have remained willing and able to borrow--and many have
enjoyed hefty gains in their stock portfolios.
The strong advance in real consumer expenditures in the first
quarter was toward the upper end of the range of outcomes
anticipated by various econometric models that the staff maintains,
but this result follows a period in which actual spending tended, on
average, to fall short of the models' predictions. Increases in
wealth that seemingly failed to show through to consumption in 1995
are perhaps now translating into spending to a greater degree.
Sales of light vehicles closed out the first quarter on a
strong note and, all things considered, sales held up well early in
the second quarter. The reported figures for March and April show
sales at annual rates of 15.8 million units and 14.5 million units
respectively. We know, however, that Toyota, Honda, and Nissan kept
their books open one or two extra days for the March sales reports,
shifting into that month's tally some of the sales that occurred in
April. As a consequence, reported March sales were boosted about
1/4 million units, and April sales were cut by the same amount. In
addition, these firms had turned to heavy advertising and generous
incentives to boost sales in March, and some payback in April was to
be expected. For the industry, average sales for March and April
amounted to 15.1 million units at an annual rate, the same as the
average pace of the previous six months.
Real expenditures on durables other than motor vehicles were
particularly strong in the first quarter, with gains spread over a
wide range of goods. Outlays for nondurables were boosted by
increases for food and apparel. The relatively strong growth in the
durables category extended a long-term uptrend in their share of
real PCE (see chart). Relative price movements have encouraged this
movement. Indeed, on a nominal basis, the durables share has tended
to edge down over time.

The advance report on April retail sales suggests that real PCE
for goods excluding cars and trucks was little changed from March
but was well above the average for the first quarter. Real spending
for food and apparel likely continued to rise last month, offsetting
declines in real purchases of gasoline and home durable goods. In
the services category of PCE, the return of more normal seasonal
temperatures probably led to a drop in purchases of energy services
last month; spending in March had been boosted by colder-than-
average temperatures.
Consumer sentiment remained upbeat in April. Although the
Michigan SRC index dipped a bit, it remained in the middle of the
favorable range that has prevailed since early 1994. Views on
current conditions were quite positive. However, higher interest
rates reportedly led to a less favorable opinion of future business
and personal financial conditions. Meanwhile, the Conference
Board's index of consumer confidence surged in April, to the highest
level in this expansion. Views on current and expected economic and
employment conditions improved markedly.2
Income growth remained strong in the first quarter. The staff
estimates that revised real disposable personal income grew
2.7 percent at an annual rate and that the revised personal saving
rate averaged 4.6 percent--a bit less than in the fourth quarter.
The strike at General Motors in March lowered first-quarter labor
income a touch, and "rental income" was held down by transactions
costs associated with a pickup in mortgage refinancings.
Housing Markets
Housing activity has shown little sign of succumbing yet to the
run-up in mortgage rates that began in February. Indeed, single-
family housing starts jumped 4 percent in April, to 1.21 million
units at an annual rate--the highest number since 1994. The solid
gains seen this year in income and employment--and the associated
bolstering of consumer confidence--may well have countered the early
restraining effects of the rise in rates.
Households evidently have noticed the rise in interest rates:
In the April Michigan SRC survey, assessments of homebuying
conditions deteriorated, mainly in response to higher mortgage
rates. Even so, through early May, home builders continued to
2. The Michigan SRC sentiment index excludes its question on
expected unemployment, but the Conference Board confidence index
includes its question on employment expectations.

indicate that new home sales were strong, and applications for home
financing at mortgage bankers remained fairly high.
In the multifamily housing sector, starts ticked back up in
April to just above the 300,000 mark once again. This series has
been moving sideways for about a year and a half, at a level that
still is fairly low historically. Market conditions vary
geographically, but the overall rental vacancy rate for multifamily
housing seems to have tilted back up--the rate exceeded year-earlier
levels in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter
of this year. Also, the absorption rate for rental apartments edged
back down in 1995 after several years of increase.
Business Fixed Investment
After moderating in the middle and latter part of 1995, growth
in real business fixed investment increased smartly in the first
quarter of this year. The pickup was concentrated in spending for
producers' durable equipment, which jumped 14-1/2 percent at an
annual rate.
At least some of the fundamentals for investment would not lead
one to expect such strength. The change in the rate of output
growth (the "accelerator") and the growth in cash flow have been
shifting down for some time. Econometric models that incorporate
these variables generally were not surprised by the slowing in
equipment outlays last year but failed to anticipate the first-
quarter rebound. In contrast, a third determinant, the user cost of
capital for equipment, fell substantially last year. Much of this
decline was traceable to another sharp drop in the relative price of
computing equipment, but the 1995 rallies in bond and stock markets
also were a factor. A neoclassical investment model, in which the
cost of capital is featured prominently, shows a mean lag from the
cost of capital to investment of about three quarters. Owing in
large part to a run-up in corporate borrowing rates in 1994, this
model was not surprised by the slowdown in PDE growth last year.
Over the first half of this year, the model is predicting a
noticeable acceleration in PDE that reflects the lagged effects of
last year's decline in the cost of capital. However, the recent
backup in corporate borrowing rates has reduced the rate of decline
in the cost of capital, and the model expects that this will exert a
drag on equipment spending in the latter part of this year.
Turning to monthly indicators, new orders for nondefense
capital goods excluding aircraft fell in March, but this drop came

II-16
on the heels of a strong February gain. These orders, which
flattened out in the second and third quarters of last year, have
since been rising. Orders for computing equipment, although quite
erratic in recent months, have strengthened after a lull in mid-
1995. Business spending for computers continued to advance at a
robust pace in the first quarter, suggesting that anecdotal reports
of weak demand from businesses were off the mark.
Business purchases of computing equipment are being spurred by
at least a couple of factors. First, in all segments of the
market--mainframes, servers, workstations, and PCs--intense
competitive pressures continue to drive prices lower. The big
players (such as IBM, Compaq, and Hewlett Packard) are pushing hard
to boost market share and have shown a willingness to absorb some
shrinkage in margins to accomplish this. Indeed, Compaq recently
announced price cuts in the range of 25 percent for a number of its
Pentium and Pentium Pro desktop machines. It also cut the prices on
many of its servers an average of about 10 percent. In part,
computer manufacturers are passing along to customers lower costs of
components, most notably DRAM and microprocessors. A second factor
that is boosting business demand is an apparent acceleration in the
migration of computing systems at businesses to local area networks
that run on software such as Windows NT. This software only runs
smoothly on state-of-the art PCs; however, according to Intel,
80 percent of the installed base of PCs at U.S. corporations run on
processors from the older 486 generation or one of its predecessors.
Among other capital goods (excluding aircraft), new orders
flattened out, on net, during the first half of last year but have
trended up since then. In the first quarter, these orders recorded
a 3.7 percent gain, and backlogs rose substantially; as a
consequence, shipments are likely to rise further in the current
quarter.
Spending for nonresidential structures continued to advance in
the first quarter, reflecting another huge increase in construction
of hotels and motels. The "other commercial" sector, which has
recorded strong gains during the past few years, slowed in the first
quarter, and contracts--a forward-looking indicator of
construction--have shown considerable weakness in recent months.
Office construction, which had been trending up since early 1994,
fell late last year and early this year; the contracts data signal
continuing weakness down the road in this sector. Elsewhere,

II-17
outlays for industrial structures have decelerated during the past
year or so, and weakness in contracts suggests further slowing in
the coming months.
Inventories
After a one-month blip in January--possibly reflecting
disruptions related to the blizzard--inventory accumulation in
manufacturing and trade proceeded at a slower pace in February, and
stocks declined in March as auto inventories continued to contract.
While stocks remained on the high side in a few areas in March,
inventory-sales ratios for most types of firms apparently were in
the acceptable range.
In manufacturing, inventories were little changed in March
after a sharp run-up in January and a moderate increase in February.
The slowing pace of accumulation over the first quarter apparently
reflected manufacturers' ongoing inventory correction efforts. In a
number of industries in which inventories were thought to be
somewhat excessive earlier this year--for example, household
durables, textiles, and printing and publishing--production
adjustments and increased shipments helped to trim stocks in March,
pushing down inventory-sales ratios considerably. In contrast,
stocks at several materials-producing industries rose further in
March, while shipments either declined or remained unchanged;
further inventory adjustments at these industries appeared to be
necessary, and this process seems to have been reflected in the
April production patterns. For nondefense capital goods as a group,
inventories declined in March after a period of accumulation during
the past year. Unlike other industries, however, the March decline
in stocks held at capital goods industries likely reflected only a
momentary pause, as orders of producers' durable equipment have, in
general, remained firm in recent months.
In wholesale and retail trade, inventories were trimmed further
in March. Motor vehicle stocks were reduced sharply, and stocks at
other wholesale and retail establishments showed only small net
increases in the aggregate. Over the first quarter, wholesale
inventories excluding motor vehicles expanded at a modest
$3.6 billion annual rate, well below the pace observed over the
preceding year and a half. The stocks of non-auto retailers rose
moderately in the first quarter, reversing the decline that had
taken place in the final quarter of 1995. The first-quarter
accumulations left most wholesalers and retailers with relatively

comfortable inventory positions. With only a few exceptions,
inventory-sales ratios at the end of March were well below their
most recent peaks.
Federal Sector
On a unified budget basis, the Monthly Treasury Statement
reported that the deficit for the first six months of the fiscal
year, October through March, totaled $128 billion. When adjusted
for deposit insurance, spectrum auction proceeds, and shifts in the
timing of payments, the deficit was $140 billion, a drop of
$18 billion from the comparable period a year ago.
On this adjusted basis, outlays in the first six months of the
fiscal year were only 1.7 percent above the level of a year earlier.
Outlays have been restrained in part by this year's cuts in
discretionary appropriations and the ongoing scaling back of defense
spending. Growth of outlays for Medicaid also has slowed. Although
trends in this category can be difficult to discern, some payoff may
be emerging from states' efforts to gain better control of their
Medicaid outlays through introduction of managed care.
Unified budget receipts have grown at a healthy pace this
fiscal year. According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, receipts
from individual and social insurance taxes were 5 percent higher in
the first six months of fiscal year 1996 than in the comparable
year-earlier period, roughly in line with the growth of personal
income. Corporate tax receipts in the first half of the current
fiscal year were up 13 percent from a year earlier, boosted by gains
in corporate profits over that period.
More recent Treasury data indicate a substantial gain in net
final settlements on 1995 tax liabilities, as payments of
nonwithheld and self-employment taxes rose sharply while refunds to
individuals increased only modestly. Federal receipts of individual
nonwithheld and self-employment taxes totaled $106 billion from
April 1 through May 14, about $20 billion above last year's level,
based on Daily Treasury Statement data. The robust year-to-year
gain in individual nonwithheld and self-employment tax payments so
far this tax season is substantially larger than the growth in
income from 1994 to 1995. The strength in these payments may be
explained in part by strong performance in the capital markets last
year that likely has boosted capital gains realizations. Indeed,
capital gains distributions by mutual funds surged to $55 billion in
1995 from $30 billion in 1994. Daily Treasury Statement data show

refund payments totaling $86 billion through the current week, a
rise of $9 billion from last year.3 This figure, however, may
overstate the gains for the tax season as a whole because last
year's payment pattern was distorted by an IRS anti-fraud initiative
that resulted in a surge of payments during the last week of May.
On April 17, CBO released revised budget estimates that show a
fiscal 1996 baseline deficit totaling $144 billion, an estimate
similar to the projection released by OMB in March. The CBO
estimate includes appropriations bills enacted through mid-April and
assumes that spending levels for the remainder of the fiscal year
will be very close to those contained in the recently passed
appropriations bill, discussed below; however, the estimate does not
take account of the surprising strength of revenues in April and
early May. CBO's longer-term outlook is for deficits to rise to
$171 billion in fiscal 1997 and by about $25 billion in each fiscal
year thereafter.
Meanwhile, the President has signed an appropriations bill that
completed fiscal 1996 funding for discretionary programs whose
regular appropriations had not yet been enacted. He also has signed
a farm bill, a debt-ceiling bill, and a bill providing for a limited
Presidential line-item veto. The farm bill sets payments to farmers
that would no longer be tightly linked to farmers' production
decisions or to market prices. It is expected to increase outlays
about $3 billion this year but schedules a decline in payments over
the next several years that is expected to save $2 billion in total.
The debt-ceiling bill increases the statutory debt ceiling to
$5.5 trillion, a limit that is expected to allow the Treasury to
fund its deficits through the end of fiscal 1997. In addition, the
bill eased the social security earnings test; the budgetary impact
of this change was offset by tightening eligibility rules for
disability benefits and dependents' benefits.
State and Local Government Sector
Real outlays for state and local consumption and gross
investment are estimated to have fallen 1.0 percent in the first
quarter. Virtually all of the reduction reflects an adjustment BEA
made to compensation to take account of days of work missed by
3. Refunds shown in the Daily Treasury Statement are not directly
comparable with those shown in the Monthly Treasury Statement. The
Daily Treasury Statement figure for individual refunds includes the
refundable portion of EITC payments, but the Monthly Treasury
Statement records these payments as outlays.

government employees because of the severe winter weather. Notably,
this is the first time BEA decided to make this type of adjustment
to state and local spending, although the agency has routinely made
weather-related, or furlough-related, adjustments to federal
compensation. BEA assumed that education and noneducation employees
affected by the blizzard were out two to three days during the
quarter and that the teachers and support staff will be making up
the days in the second quarter. The days for other government
workers are assumed to be lost permanently. Overall, real state and
local consumption spending fell 1.1 percent in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, real gross investment also declined a little as
construction spending edged down, the first decline in two years.
Despite the reduction in government consumption in the first
quarter, the state and local surplus, excluding social insurance
funds, appears to have fallen a little. A downward trend in this
measure has been evident during the past few quarters, as growth in
aggregate government expenditures has exceeded gains in revenues.
Prices
Incoming price data since the last Greenbook have been
dominated by developments in energy and agriculture. A surge in
energy prices in April accounted for more than half of the
0.4 percent rise in the total CPI. In agriculture, grain prices
have climbed further in recent weeks, and although retail food
prices have grown only moderately this year, recent developments
seem to point to a greater risk of large food price increases down
the road. Prices outside of food and energy rose just slightly in
April, and core CPI inflation remained well below 3 percent on a
twelve-month basis.
In the energy sector, spot prices of crude oil and some
petroleum products have recently dropped back from earlier highs.
The price of West Texas intermediate, for example, has averaged a
little above $21 per barrel in May after peaking at more than
$25 dollars per barrel in early April. In addition, survey data
suggest that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of
gasoline should rise much less rapidly this month. Stocks remain
tight for both crude oil and the major petroleum products, but
futures prices continue to point to some further easing of oil and
product prices over the remainder of the year.
In agricultural markets, the futures price of wheat for May
delivery (Kansas City basis) has moved up about 40 percent since the

March Greenbook, and futures prices of corn for May delivery have
advanced about 30 percent. This past year, both domestic users and
foreign buyers have shown limited elasticity in their demand, with
popular analyses noting the higher fixed costs of current American
meat production technologies and rapidly growing food consumption in
emerging economies. Inventories of both corn and wheat are
extremely tight, and the prospects for rebuilding wheat stocks have
been dimmed by drought in the central and southern plains. The corn
crop is still being planted, and the critical growing months lie
ahead. As of mid-May, futures prices for corn were considerably
lower than spot prices, a reflection of traders' expectations of a
somewhat better supply-demand balance following this year's harvest.
In other farm markets, soybean prices have recently been pushed
higher by spillover from the grain markets. Livestock prices have
been mixed: The prices of hogs and poultry have been firming and
are well above year-earlier levels, but cattle prices have been
weak.
Price increases for food at the consumer level have been quite
moderate in the face of surging grain prices. The CPI for food was
up 0.3 percent in April and, on balance, rose only moderately over
the first four months of the year; the twelve-month change was
2.6 percent. The index for fruit and vegetable prices rose
1.0 percent in April, capping the much larger increase of the
previous month. However, increases in cereals prices remained
small, and the price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs edged
down. Clearer evidence of the pass-through of grain prices to the
retail level probably will emerge in many of these categories over
the course of the summer.
The consumer price index excluding food and energy increased
0.1 percent in April after three months of somewhat larger
increases. Prices for goods turned down in April after jumping
0.4 percent in March. The swing was shaped largely by monthly ups
and downs in the prices of apparel, tobacco, and used cars. New car
prices increased 0.1 percent in both March and April. Prices for
non-energy services posted a 0.3 percent gain last month after a
0.2 percent rise in March. Auto finance charges--which had dropped
sharply earlier in the year in response to automaker incentives--
edged up in both March and April.
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods excluding
food and energy rose a modest 0.1 percent in April; this index

showed little net change over the first four months of 1996 but is
up 1.8 percent from a year earlier. The PPI for intermediate
materials excluding food and energy continued to edge down in April,
with few signs that indirect effects of the rise in energy prices
might be affecting price setting for other products. Price indexes
for industrial commodities have been mixed since the March
Greenbook, with the Journal of Commerce index little changed and the
KR-CRB spot price index for industrial products moving up somewhat.
Recent survey data on consumers' expectations of year-ahead
inflation have been mixed. Mean expected inflation over the next
twelve months jumped to 4.5 percent in April's Michigan Survey of
consumers, 1/4 percentage point above the March level and
1/2 percentage point above the level at the beginning of the year.
This series is quite volatile and has tended to be higher than
actual inflation over the last five years--a period when inflation
has been low and stable. Median expected inflation--which is
influenced less by outliers in the sample and, thus, is less
volatile--rose less in the April sample; the April reading of
3.0 percent was about where it has been over the past year.
Labor Costs
The trend in growth of hourly compensation appears to have held
fairly steady through the first part of 1996. As measured by the
employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation of private industry
workers increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first
quarter, essentially the same rate of increase as over the previous
twelve months. ECI compensation growth was held down by a small
decline in benefit costs. In contrast, wages and salaries shot up
at a 4.6 percent annual rate, up from a 2.8 percent rise in 1995 and
the largest increase in five years. Wage growth in the first
quarter was particularly rapid for white collar workers and
employees in the retail trade and services industries. Sales
workers, who account for approximately 11 percent of the ECI sample,
had the sharpest acceleration in wages and salaries.
The reported decline in benefit costs in the first quarter
seems to confirm our earlier suspicion that the fourth-quarter jump
in benefits was caused, at least in part, by late collection of the
data that resulted from the government shutdown. In completing
their survey forms, companies are asked to indicate if any
unscheduled changes have been made in benefits since the last
quarterly survey, and some changes that normally would have been

reported for the first quarter may have been misallocated to the
fourth quarter of last year. The average rate of change in
benefits over the two quarters was about 1-1/2 percent at an annual
rate, suggesting that businesses are continuing to meet with
considerable success in their efforts to gain control of this part
of their labor costs.
In previous Greenbooks, we have also called attention to the
possibility that with labor markets tight, workers might eventually
start to gain back through faster increases in hourly wages some of
the shortfall of compensation growth that has come about as a result
of the restraint on benefit costs. Although the first-quarter jump
in wages certainly is consistent with such an outcome, some caution
in interpreting the data is also in order. The earnings of sales
workers, which were an important element in the first-quarter step-
up of wage growth, are quite volatile and perhaps should be
discounted in assessing underlying trends. Moreover, separate data
on average hourly earnings suggest that, at most, the pickup in wage
growth is occurring quite gradually. For the twelve months ended in
April, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers on nonfarm payrolls moved up 3.1 percent, no faster than the
rise during the previous twelve-month period.
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased sharply
in the first quarter. The 2.6 percent rate of increase offset the
surprising 1.0 percent decline in the fourth quarter and put the
four-quarter change at 1.6 percent. BLS adjusted the growth of
hours upward 3/4 percentage point from what a literal reading of the
blizzard-affected numbers would have said, so the estimated
productivity change is probably a reasonable approximation of
reality--assuming, of course, that revisions to output growth are no
larger than we currently are anticipating.
4. Some of the detail on benefit costs provides further
indication of possible misallocation between the two quarters. For
example, health insurance costs, not seasonally adjusted, rose
3.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995 but declined 1.0 percent
in the first quarter of 1996; by contrast, in most other years of
the 1990s, health insurance costs increased particularly rapidly in
the first quarter and quite slowly in the fourth quarter.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The decision to leave short-term rates unchanged at the March
FOMC meeting was widely anticipated and had little immediate market
impact. Judging by quotes on federal funds futures at that time,
market participants still expected that the next System policy move
would be an easing. However, sentiment shifted with the
accumulation of evidence showing the economy to have considerable
forward momentum. At present, market expectations tilt in the
direction of a modest tightening later this year.
The shift in outlook has pushed up intermediate- and long-term
Treasury rates 25 to 40 basis points. The thirty-year Treasury
yield crossed 7 percent for the first time in a year, before easing
back in recent days. Most private-sector rates have moved up with
Treasuries, although rates on lower-rated corporate bonds have risen
less. Major stock price indexes, apart from the Dow, increased over
the intermeeting period; the NYSE composite was up 2 percent, and
the NASDAQ composite jumped about 13 percent, an increase reflecting
renewed enthusiasm for technology stocks.
Total nonfederal debt growth appears to have remained moderate
in recent months. In the household sector, consumer credit growth
slowed a bit in the first quarter, while net mortgage borrowing
probably continued near the pace of last year. Responding to higher
long-term rates, gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations
has fallen off recently, but this drop-off has been offset partly by
greater short-term borrowing. Gross issuance of long-term debt by
state and local governments also has edged off from late last year.
Federal borrowing, after a first-quarter pickup, has dropped
back sharply in the current quarter and might have been weaker still
had the Treasury anticipated the full dimension of recent tax
receipts.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 and M3 growth slowed sharply in April after an unusually
strong increase in March (table). Both aggregates expanded at more
than a 10 percent annual rate in March and then decelerated to a 2
percent rate in April. With the recent slowing, both aggregates
have moved to around the upper bounds of their respective annual
ranges.

The deceleration of the broad monetary aggregates in April may
reflect the rise in market interest rates in recent months, which
has increased the opportunity cost of holding deposits. Moreover,
variability in the size and timing of tax payments is always a
potential source of erratic M2 behavior in the spring. This year
the weekly pattern of M2 suggests that growth may have been damped
in April by unusually large personal tax payments, though in past
years large payments have usually boosted M2 growth as deposits
built up in advance of payments.
Ml continues to be pulled down by sweep activity. In addition,
initial demand for the redesigned hundred dollar bill, introduced at
the end of March, has proved to be less than expected, and currency
growth has been sluggish.
After contracting in March, bank credit increased at a 6
percent rate in April on the strength of bank lending and a leveling
off of securities holdings (table). The March decline--the first
since July 1991--was due in part to the backup in interest rates,
which reduced the market value of bank securities portfolios and
off-balance-sheet positions in derivatives. Adjusted for this
effect, bank credit was flat in March and rose at a 7-1/2 percent
annual rate in April.
The April pickup in lending was paced by a turnaround in
business loans, an increase that may have reflected a shift to
short-term financing in response to the rise in long-term rates. On
balance, however, business loans in the past two months have been
somewhat weak even as lenders remain accommodative. According to
the May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, underwriting standards
for business loans were unchanged from January, while lenders, on
net, continued to ease terms a bit.
Real estate loan growth remained sluggish in April, likely
because of the continued high fixed-rate share of new home
mortgages, which banks tend to securitize. The tendency to sell off
fixed-rate loans may well mask healthy underlying demand for
mortgage loans to purchase homes; indeed, the May loan officer
survey indicates that demand for such loans has been higher in the
past three months than in the previous three months. In contrast,
the demand for commercial real estate loans was little changed, on
net, according to the survey.
While consumer lending appeared strong in April, much of the
increase was due to a sizable acquisition of credit card receivables

by one bank. Taking out this acquisition, consumer lending
(adjusted for securitization) grew at an annual rate of only about 5
percent last month, down significantly from March. For the year to
date, consumer lending at banks, with the adjustment for the April
acquisition and securitizations, expanded at a 12 percent annual
rate, down from the 16-1/2 percent advance recorded last year.
While we doubt that it was the major factor in the recent
slowing in consumer loan growth, tighter lending standards may have
played some role. On net, about 20 percent of the respondents to
the May loan officer survey reported having tightened standards for
approving credit card applications, and about 10 percent reported
having tightened standards for other consumer installment loans.
Mutual Funds
Long-term mutual funds posted the largest quarterly inflow on
record in the first quarter, with stock funds accounting for more
than 80 percent of the total (table). Preliminary data for April
suggest that heavy flows into stock funds continued, while flows
into bond funds slowed markedly. Flows into bond funds have been
primarily to the income and junk bond categories, funds for which
returns are most closely linked to those on equities. Industry
participants report that the strong mutual fund inflows this year
have been mostly related to retirement accounts.
Although dollar inflows to stock funds are at record levels,
net sales as a percentage of fund assets show more moderate growth
(chart, middle panel). Moreover, mutual fund inflows may overstate
household demand for equities. Flow of funds data indicate that, in
1995, sales by households of direct holdings of corporate equity
exceeded purchases of mutual funds by $50 billion. Preliminary data
for the first quarter indicate that households continue to be net
sellers of equity. A good share of the liquidation in direct
holdings may have been driven by corporate repurchase and merger
activity.
Holdings of cash and short-term securities in stock funds fell
to 7 percent by the end of March from nearly 8 percent at the end of
1995 (chart, bottom panel). The lower liquidity ratio may reflect
competitive pressures to be fully invested, as cash holdings have
proved an impediment to performance in the ongoing bull market.

Business Finance
The increase in long-term rates has continued to damp bond
issuance by nonfinancial corporations (table and chart). Gross
public issuance in April and early May was about a third below the
first-quarter pace, with the most pronounced falloff at investment-
grade firms; lower-rated firms eased back their issuance in April
but still found the market a fairly attractive source of funding.
With the backup in rates, short-term financing has gained some
favor, and the volume of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding
has moved up briskly--bolstered by merger financing.
Boosted by a spike in initial public offerings, equity issuance
by nonfinancial corporations jumped in April to a record level
(table). Rising stock prices and strong investor demand has
increased the pace of gross equity offerings (chart). Issuance in
May should remain healthy, judging from the steady flow of
registrations of new offerings with the SEC.
On net, however, nonfinancial corporations have continued to
retire equity. Announced stock buybacks by nonfinancial firms in
the first quarter jumped to $28 billion, the highest quarterly pace
since the late 1980s. Unlike the buybacks at that time, current
activity is concentrated at profitable companies with excess cash on
their balance sheets and is not being financed by borrowing. Based
on the announcements, completed repurchases in the first quarter, at
an annual rate, are estimated to have been about a third above the
high volume for the year 1995.
The ongoing merger wave also resulted in substantial share
retirements in the first quarter. In addition, several blockbuster
deals were announced over the intermeeting period, the two largest
involving the consolidation of some "Baby Bell" telephone companies
permitted by the recently approved telecommunication bill. However,
virtually all of the recently announced megamergers are structured
as stock swaps and thus will not result in equity retirements.
Since the last FOMC meeting, the NASDAQ composite index has
risen more than 13 percent, as investor enthusiasm for technology
and small-cap stocks resurfaced (chart). Other broad equity indexes
have risen by much less--about 2 percent, but still have
significantly outperformed bonds. Stock prices received some
support from the strong first-quarter earnings reports which pointed
to a small uptick in the four-quarter growth rate (chart, middle
left panel). However, analysts do not expect particularly robust

earnings growth in the near term, and the ratio of current price to
expected year-ahead S&P 500 earnings remains high. Looking out
further, analysts have been raising their estimates of longer-term
profit growth, likely buoying stock prices (chart, middle right
panel).
With earnings continuing to be strong, various indicators show
that the credit quality of nonfinancial firms has remained solid,
except for some slippage in the retail sector. In the first
quarter, Moody's downgraded somewhat more nonfinancial debt than it
upgraded, but K Mart and WalMart accounted for most of the net
downgrade; at quarter-end, nonfinancial debt on review at Moody's
for a possible downgrade about equalled that on review for an
upgrade. In addition, first-quarter data indicate that the default
rate of junk bonds fell below one percent, less than half the rate
in 1995. The small losses seemed to reassure investors, as spreads
on high-yield debt over Treasuries have now retraced the entire rise
posted last year (chart); spreads on investment-grade bonds have
edged lower since the last FOMC meeting. Business failures, a
broader measure of stress that also covers firms with no public debt
outstanding, fell about a third in the first quarter after a fourth-
quarter spike, and are only slightly above levels in 1994 and 1995.
Household Sector Finance
Home mortgage rates have increased substantially over the
intermeeting period. In line with the overall movement of the yield
curve, the average contract rates on thirty-year, fixed rate
mortgages rose more than 40 basis points, to 8-1/4 percent, and ARMs
indexed to the one-year Treasury constant maturity rose 20 basis
points (chart, upper panel). Thus, the FRM-ARM initial rate spread
moved up to 244 basis points, the widest spread since the end of
1994. Nevertheless, data through March indicate borrowers continue
to favor fixed-rate financing (chart, middle panel).
Despite the rise in rates, mortgage purchase applications for
home purchases remained relatively elevated. The refinancing index,
however, declined further, on net, over the period and is now less
than half the peak level reached in mid-February (chart, lower
panel).
Consumer installment credit grew at an annual rate of
7-1/4 percent in March, about half the rate of increase in February
(table). For the first quarter as a whole, consumer installment
credit advanced at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate, off about

1 percentage point from the fourth-quarter pace and 2 percentage
points from the rise for all of 1995. The slowing of growth last
quarter was concentrated in the auto credit component; growth of
revolving credit picked up to a 16 percent rate in the first
quarter but remained below the average pace last year. As noted,
commercial bank data for April point to subdued consumer credit
growth last month.
Only limited information about consumer loan quality has become
available since the last Greenbook. Delinquencies on auto loans at
captive finance companies in the first quarter moved down slightly--
the first decline in two years--from historically high levels. The
Moody's monthly index of delinquencies on credit card loans in
securitized pools increased in both January and February, reaching a
two-year high, although it is still well below the peak in the early
1990s. In the May loan officer survey, more than a quarter of the
banks, on net, noted that consumer loan delinquency rates in the
past six months were higher than they had expected. On balance,
respondents to the survey expect a further rise in delinquencies
over the coming year.
Despite some concern about rising household debt levels,
issuance of credit-card-backed securities remained quite strong this
year. Concerns in the asset-backed market have centered on the
credit card programs of a few, relatively small private-label
retailers, which account for a minuscule proportion of the $150
billion market. Bank issuers continue to obtain the highest
ratings. Even with the vastly increased supply of credit-card-
backed paper in 1995 and 1996, spreads against comparable maturity
Treasuries have remained at or near historic lows.
Treasury and Agency Financing
The debt ceiling impasse came to an end in March after Congress
raised the national debt limit by $600 billion to $5.5 trillion.
This increase is expected to sustain normal deficit financing and
trust fund issues through at least the third quarter of 1997,
perhaps a few months more. The six-month impasse resulted in some
disruptions to the timing and size of auctions but, on balance,
probably did not add substantially to issuance costs as market
participants apparently discounted the possibility of debt default.
During the current quarter, the stronger-than-expected inflow
of federal tax receipts is projected to result in a budget surplus
of $52 billion (table). The surplus likely will generate the

first quarterly paydown of marketable Treasury debt since 1981, and
at the same time, will enable the Treasury to replenish its cash
balance.
At its midquarter refunding, the Treasury announced a new
auction schedule to better align its longer-term borrowing with its
greater seasonal borrowing requirements in the second half of the
year. The new schedule includes two extra auctions of the ten-year
note and one extra auction of the thirty-year bond. Because the
Treasury intends to decrease the size of the ten-year and thirty-
year securities auctions somewhat, it does not expect the average
maturity of the outstanding debt to increase. There appeared to be
little market reaction to the announcement.
The Treasury also announced that it intends to issue inflation-
indexed bonds in a multiyear experiment that could reduce Treasury
financing costs. Precise terms of the new bonds have not yet been
set, and the Treasury is seeking comments from potential investors.
These bonds will be issued in small denominations and are expected
to be purchased largely for retirement accounts by buyers who want
to hedge against inflation.
Agency financing slowed considerably in the first quarter, and
preliminary indications are that net borrowing remained light over
the intermeeting period (table). Higher rates have reduced new
issues and virtually halted refinancing as agencies have less
incentive to call outstanding debt. Spreads on primary debt and in
secondary markets remained stable.
Municipal Bonds
Long-term municipal debt offerings in April about matched the
first-quarter pace but were off from the fourth-quarter rate when
issuers took advantage of nearly two-year lows in long-term rates
(table). With retirements continuing to outpace new offerings, the
volume of tax-exempt debt has remained on a downward path. The
forward calendar of new issues looks weak, which may help explain
why yields on long-term municipal bonds have risen less than
proportionately to those on comparable Treasuries since the
beginning of April (chart, middle panel).
Quality spreads on long-term municipal bonds have changed
little on net since 1994, though the spreads remain a bit wider than
over the preceding few years (chart, bottom panel). Greater demand
for the highest-quality debt--as evidenced in the rising portion of

APPENDIX
THE MAY SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK
LENDING PRACTICES
The May 1996 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending
Practices posed questions about changes in bank lending standards
and terms, changes in loan demand by businesses and households, and
delinquency rates on consumer loans.
The survey results show that bank lending standards were
generally unchanged to a bit tighter compared with three months ago.
Lending standards for business loans to customers of all sizes were
about unchanged, on net. Standards for residential mortgages were
also little changed, while those for commercial real estate loans
were tightened by a modest number of respondents. Standards for
credit card accounts and other consumer installment loans were
tightened on net, although banks reported no change in their
willingness to make consumer loans.
On the whole, banks were less stringent with respect to loan
terms than lending standards. The respondents continued to ease
business loan terms, on net, while terms on consumer loans were
little changed.
Demand for bank loans by households and firms was generally
reported to be stronger than it had been three months earlier.
Demand for business loans was stronger for customers of all sizes,
although more banks noted an increase in demand by small and medium-
sized firms than by large firms. Demand for commercial real estate
loans changed little, on net. Household credit demands increased,
with a significant share of banks reporting stronger demand for
residential mortgages and a smaller fraction noting a pickup in
demand for consumer installment loans.
Responses to special questions on consumer loan delinquencies
suggest that a significant number of banks have been surprised by
the size of the recent run-up in consumer loan delinquencies. A
large share of the respondents expect a further rise in
delinquencies over the coming year.
Commercial and Industrial Loans
The May survey found that standards for approving commercial
and industrial loans other than those for mergers and acquisitions
were about unchanged over the previous three months for borrowers of
all sizes. Lending standards had tightened, on net, in the January
survey, the first net tightening in three years.
Despite the stability in lending standards, both the domestic
and foreign respondents reported some net easing of business loan
terms. The largest number of banks reported having cut spreads of
loan rates over base rates. Other terms, including maximum credit
line sizes, credit line costs, loan covenants, and collateralization
requirements, were also eased by some banks. A bigger fraction of
the domestic respondents generally reported having eased loan terms
for large corporate customers than reported doing so for small and
middle-market firms.
The institutions that reported having eased standards or terms
attributed the easing to increased competition from other banks and,
III-A-1

III-A-2
to a lesser extent, from nonbank lenders. The domestic respondents
that had tightened either standards or terms attributed the move
primarily to a reduction in their banks' tolerance for risk. In
addition, both the domestic and foreign respondents that tightened
standards or terms pointed to a less favorable economic outlook and
a worsening of industry-specific problems.
A significant number of domestic respondents, on net, reported
stronger demand for business loans by small and middle-market
businesses, while a considerably smaller net number reported
stronger demand by large corporate firms. Branches and agencies of
foreign banks reported little net change in demand. Changes in
demand were generally attributed to fluctuations in customers'
investment in inventories and in plant and equipment or, in the case
of larger firms, to fluctuations in merger and acquisition funding
needs. In addition, a number of banks noted that demand weakened as
customers shifted funding to other sources.
Commercial Real Estate
Several domestic banks, on net, reported having tightened
standards for commercial real estate lending, while the foreign
respondents reported no changes in such standards. The domestic
responses indicated little net change in the demand for commercial
real estate loans, although a few more of the foreign respondents
reported a pickup than reported a decline.
Lending to Households
Standards for approving residential mortgage applications were
little changed, on net, in the May survey. Demand for such loans
had increased at a significant share of respondents, however, likely
reflecting the strength in the housing market.
On balance, about 20 percent of the respondents indicated that
they had tightened standards for approving new credit card
applications. A smaller share, about 10 percent, had tightened
standards for non-credit-card installment loans. These shares are a
little smaller than those reported in the January survey. As in
January, however, consumer loan terms were little changed, on
balance. In the May survey a few banks reported having tightened
credit limits on credit card accounts and maximum maturities on non-
credit-card installment loans, but a few also cut spreads over
market rates on non-credit-card loans. On net, the banks'
willingness to make consumer installment loans was unchanged in the
latest survey, the first time since 1991 that the respondents did
not report a net increase in willingness to make such loans.
Nonetheless, following several years of efforts to boost consumer
lending, banks' consumer lending policies likely remain
accommodative.
The respondents reported a small net increase in demand for
consumer installment loans in the last three months relative to the
previous three months. This increase follows a small net decline in
the January survey.
The tightening of lending standards for consumer loans may
reflect, in part, a response to the rise in delinquency rates on
such loans in recent quarters. The responses to special questions
on the May survey dealing with consumer loan delinquencies indicate
that more than a quarter of the respondents, on net, were surprised

III-A-3
by the size of the increase in delinquency rates. By contrast, last
November, when a similar question was included in the survey, only
about 10 percent of the respondents, on net, indicated that the rise
in delinquency rates had been worse than expected. About half of
the respondents on the May survey expected a further increase in
delinquencies over the coming year, while only a sixth expected a
decrease. The banks attributed their concern about future
delinquency rates to increased household debt burdens and a greater
willingness of households to declare bankruptcy.
A final special question asked for the reasons for the recent
increase in the pace of consumer loan securitizations. The
respondents attributed the rise to a higher level of demand for
consumer loans than their bank was willing to hold on its books and
to their bank's improved ability to do securitizations. To a lesser
degree, the banks also attributed the rise to the capital markets
becoming more receptive to securities backed by consumer loans and
to the increased cost of funding consumer loans on their bank's
balance sheet.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
For January-February combined, the U.S. international trade
deficit in goods and services widened considerably, nearly reversing the
gains made in the fourth quarter of 1995. Imports rose by more than 2
percent, while exports were about flat. Data for March are scheduled to
be released on May 17 and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.

The level of exports of goods and services in January-February
was about the same as in the fourth quarter of 1995. Sizeable
increases in exports of services, computers, agricultural products
(mostly grains), and automotive products (other than to Mexico) were
about offset by declines in exports of industrial supplies and
machinery.
In January-February, imports grew by more than 2 percent,
after declining 1 percent in the previous quarter. Imports of
automotive products and consumer goods rebounded in the first two
months of the year from depressed levels in the second half of last
year. Imports of non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods
(other than computers and semiconductors) posted modest gains in
January-February after slumping last year.
Oil Imports
The quantity of imported oil in the first quarter is estimated
to have been about the same as the fourth-quarter level, as a strong
increase in oil consumption was offset by a larger-than-normal
seasonal drawdown in oil inventories. Preliminary Department of

Energy statistics indicate that April imports are likely to have
increased due to a buildup in oil inventories.
The price of imported oil increased substantially in the first
quarter, owing mostly to a hefty jump in the March import price--the
largest monthly increase since May 1994. Spot WTI rose more than
$2.00 per barrel in April, averaging $23.57 per barrel. Prices have
fallen back somewhat and are trading near $21.00 per barrel. Prices
have been kept firm this year because of unusually cold weather in
North America and Japan, weather-related production disruptions in
the North Sea and Australia, and several disruptions in refinery
production. Prices have also been unusually volatile because
inventories are reportedly at very low levels--on April 15, the spot
WTI jumped to more than $25 per barrel in intraday trading. Refiners
have been reluctant to build inventories because of concerns that
future oil prices could decline sharply if negotiations between Iraq
and the United Nations for a limited oil sale result in an
additional 700.000 barrels per day of oil on world markets.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased 1 percent in the
first quarter of 1996, following a similar decline in the fourth
quarter of 1995. The largest declines were in the prices of
imported computers, while food prices also posted sharp declines,
owing mostly to a drop in beverage prices.
Prices of exports increased modestly in the first quarter,
with sharp increases in agricultural export prices (primarily grain
prices) more than accounting for the increase; agricultural export
prices have risen substantially since early 1995 in response to
robust world demand, disappointing harvests abroad last year, and
poor prospects for U.S. harvests in 1996. Prices of non-
agricultural exports continued to fall, reflecting continued
declines in prices of industrial supplies and computers.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
At almost $52 billion, the first-quarter accumulation of
foreign official reserve assets in the United States was almost half
of the record total in 1995. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) The large increase was divided
almost equally between the G-10 and other, non-OPEC countries, with

most of the G-10 change associated with exchange market
intervention. Countries outside the G-10 showing significant
increases in the first quarter were Spain, Brazil, Singapore and
Thailand. Information on foreign official holdings at the FRBNY
suggest that changes in April were small for the G-10 countries, but
continued to be sizable for Spain.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) and U.S. net
purchases of foreign securities (line 5) continued in the first
quarter at or above 1995's high rates. Although private net
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were small (line 4a), there
were large increases in the holdings of U.S. agency bonds ($14
billion, included in line 4b). New Eurobond issues continued to be
an important component of line 4b in the first quarter, with
approximately a third of these issues denominated in foreign
currencies. In April, new Eurobond issues declined somewhat from
the very strong first quarter pace and the foreign currency
percentage rose to 45 percent of the total volume.
U.S. net purchases of both foreign stocks and bonds were
strong in the first quarter, with purchases of foreign stocks
especially heavy (lines 5a and 5b). Almost $12 billion of net stock
purchases were from Asian residents, with $8 billion from Japan.
Aside from $1 billion of net bond purchases from Mexico, there were
only minimal changes in U.S. holdings in Latin America (outside the
Caribbean).
Banks showed substantial net capital outflows in the first
quarter on an end-of-month basis (line 3). Monthly average data,
however, showed little change in the net claims of U.S. banks on
their own foreign offices and IBFs in the first quarter, and a
modest net outflow in April (line 1 of the International Banking
Data table).

Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average value of the dollar in terms of the other
G-10 currencies has risen 2 percent since the March 26 FOMC meeting.
The dollar strengthened 4 percent against the mark, and by lesser
amounts against most other European currencies. Against the yen,
the dollar appreciated 1/4 percent on balance.
The dollar strengthened against the mark amid signs of renewed
economic strength in the United States that may have been seen by
some market participants as increasing the likelihood of tighter
U.S. monetary policy in the near term. In contrast, continued weak
growth in Germany heightened market expectations of further German
monetary easing. The Bundesbank reinforced these expectations by
reducing its official rates by 1/2 percentage point on April 18.
However, it refrained from reducing its repo rate which remained
fixed at 3.30 percent, the rate that has prevailed since February 7.
In addition, statements in April by various Bundesbank officials,
who said that they would not be displeased if the mark weakened
further, were seen as supporting the dollar against the mark.
The dollar declined against the yen in April against the
backdrop of strengthening economic activity in Japan and market
commentary that Japanese monetary authorities would tighten monetary
policy in the near-term. However, the dollar rebounded against the
yen in mid-May following statements by Japanese officials that
Japanese monetary policy would need to remain accommodative to
insure that the fledgling economic recovery in Japan becomes self-
sustaining.
In most G-10 countries, 3-month interest rates declined or
changed little over the intermeeting period. In Italy, short-term
interest rates fell significantly as lira strength, which followed
in the wake of the center-left victory in the general elections on
April 21, allowed the Bank of Italy to guide short-term market rates
lower. Short-term interest rates declined in Canada, France, the
Netherlands, and Sweden following reductions in policy rates in
those countries. In Japan, 3-month interest rates were essentially
unchanged as Japanese monetary authorities remained accommodative in
their money market operations. The Japanese call-money rate

continued to trade at 1/2 percent, the rate that has prevailed since
September when the Bank of Japan reduced its discount rate to
1/2 percent.
Long-term interest rates were little changed in most European
countries, where economic growth remained anemic. The yield on the
10-year government bellwether bond in Italy dropped 1 percentage
point due largely to diminished political uncertainty following the
general elections. Long-term Canadian interest rates rose, though
by less than U.S. long-term rates, as economic prospects in Canada
appeared to have brightened.
Since the March 26 FOMC meeting, the Mexican peso has
appreciated 1-1/2 percent against the dollar as inflationary fears
in Mexico have receded. On May 1, Mexican authorities placed $1.75
billion of a 30-year global bond that was exchanged for a face value
of $2.4 billion of Brady bonds that would have expired in 23 years.
At the time of issue, the yield spread of the global bond over the
30-year U.S. Treasury bond was 5-1/2 percentage points. (On a
stripped basis, the Brady bonds yielded 6 percentage points more
than comparable U.S. Treasury securities.) By retiring the Brady
bonds, the Mexican government obtained access to collateral valued
at more than $500 million.
The Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market over
the intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The pace of economic activity in continental Europe remains
generally weak, with Germany sluggish after probably having
contracted further in the first quarter, Italy stagnant, and France
showing signs of only modest recovery from a fourth-quarter decline.
The United Kingdom and Canada appear to be extending modest rates of
expansion, and recent data for Japan suggest a continuation of
growth somewhat in excess of the potential rate.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. Recent consumer price
inflation has averaged close to 2 percent or less in Germany,
France, and Canada, and just under 3 percent in the United Kingdom.
Italian inflation is higher but has slowed considerably since
January. In Japan, prices rose slightly after falling for more than
a year.

IV-12
Individual country notes. Available indicators in Japan for
the first quarter, including industrial production, machinery
orders, and housing starts, point to further economic recovery.
After reaching a postwar high of 3.4 percent in January, the
unemployment rate declined to 3.1 percent in March.
Following more than a year of deflation, both wholesale prices
and the CPI for the Tokyo area moved up in April from their levels
12 months earlier. This increase was entirely due to the effect of
yen depreciation on import prices, as wholesale prices of
domestically produced goods fell 1.0 percent in the 12 months
through April. The Japan Real Estate Institute announced that land
prices in six major urban areas declined a further 5.4 percent in
the six months through March. This was the ninth consecutive six-
month decline in land prices. Land prices have fallen about 50
percent since their peak in 1991.

The merchandise trade surplus declined to a five-year low of

the previous quarter and $107 billion for 1995 as a whole. The
current account surplus was $62 billion (SAAR) in the first quarter,
down from $94 billion in the previous quarter and $111 billion for
1995 as a whole.

IV-13
On May 10, the Diet formally approved the budget for the
fiscal year that began on April 1. Central government expenditures
are projected to be nearly 8 percent lower than the final outcome
for FY1995. (Published reports have focused on a measure of spending
that includes redemptions of national bonds, which implies
expenditures that are only 4 percent lower than the final total for
FY1995.)
It appears likely that real activity in Germany contracted in
the first quarter. The unemployment rate (SA) rose sharply to
average 10.3 percent, and remained at that level in April. Although
industrial production experienced a modest rise in March, it was
still below its level in January and at any time in 1995. The six
German research institutes and the Council of Economic Experts (the
"Five Wise Men") lowered earlier projections for real growth this
year to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent, about in line with the
government's revised official assessment. Despite the downward
revisions, forecasts continue to project a pick-up in real economic
activity in the near term. A jump in output is expected in the
second quarter, as construction and other weather-sensitive sectors
experience a rebound after the unseasonably cold winter.
On April 26, Chancellor Kohl presented a package of budget
measures designed to reduce spending in 1997 by DM 70 billion ($47
billion), divided about equally among cuts at the federal level, at
the state and local level, and in the social security system. The
budget's proposed two-year wage freeze for public sector workers and
reduction in paid sick leave has prompted the union of public sector
workers to threaten strike action and warning strikes have erupted.
The announcement of the program also has provoked strong opposition
from the Social Democrats, who still hold a majority of the seats in
the upper house of the federal parliament and must ratify any
measures that affect the states.
The outcome of state parliamentary elections on March 24 in
three German states was generally favorable to Chancellor Kohl's
ruling coalition and unfavorable to the opposition Social Democrats

In France, monthly indicators suggest that economic activity
grew only moderately in the first quarter after factoring in some
bounceback in production following the public sector strikes late
last year. Industrial production rose in January and February, but
not enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising further in the

IV-15
first quarter. First-quarter business confidence surveys suggest
that output was weak amid continued inventory correction, although
confidence about future output has begun to strengthen. Real
consumption of manufactured products in February and March fell back
from the sharp rise of January that in part reflected a strike-
rebound effect. Consumer confidence dipped in April after remaining
unchanged throughout the first quarter at a very low level.
Consumer price inflation accelerated slightly in March and April
largely due to higher food and energy prices and a pick-up in the
prices of manufactured products.
In the United Kingdom, preliminary data show that real GDP
rose 1.6 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter. Available data on
activity to date in 1996 are mixed. Industrial output picked up in
February and March, reversing January's decline. However, according
to the April Purchasing Managers' Survey, indexes for manufacturing
output and new orders continued to decline. Interest-sensitive
sectors are showing more positive signs. The same April survey
showed robust growth in the consumer durable manufacturing sector.
The housing market also appears to be strengthening as mortgage
approvals in the first quarter were the highest since early 1991.

Targeted inflation, measured as the change from a year earlier
in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, has been
little changed through April from the fourth-quarter average of 2.9
percent. April producer input prices edged up due to a rise in oil
and food prices.
Newly revised and rebased GDP data for Italy show that
business fixed investment expanded 7.7 percent last year and
contributed more to GDP growth than had been indicated in earlier
statistics. The new data also show that GDP growth for the year as
a whole was about 2.3 percent (Q4/Q4), but GDP declined 3.6 percent
(SAAR) in the fourth quarter largely due to a sharp drop in exports
and reduced government expenditure. The slow performance at the end
of last year appears to have continued into the first quarter.
Following a sharp drop in January, industrial production declined
again in February.
On balance, news on Italian inflation has been encouraging.
The 12-month CPI inflation rate declined in three successive months
before plateauing in April. Inflation in both wholesale prices and
producer prices slowed in February, and the 12-month rate of
increase of wages in January declined to 4 percent, down about 1/2
percentage point from the increase recorded in December.
The victory of the center-left "Olive Tree" coalition in
general elections on April 21 put the left in power for the first
time in fifty years. Because the election resulted in only a
plurality (albeit a strong one) in both parliamentary houses, the
coalition is likely to need support from the hard-core Communist
Refoundation party, with which it had an election alliance. Romano
Prodi, a Bologna economics professor, is expected to be confirmed as
prime minister-designate by the end of May. Following the election,
Prodi declared that one of his first priorities is to put the
Italian lira back into the ERM. Prodi also has indicated that he
has plans for more rigorous budget cuts.

In Canada, economic activity appears to have expanded at a
moderate pace in the first quarter. Most indicators increased in
January to levels above their fourth-quarter average, but then
declined in February. In March, manufacturing shipments declined
further, in part reflecting the closure of Canadian motor vehicle
plants affected by the GM strike. Employment growth through April
has been robust, although the unemployment rate has been little
changed as increased labor force participation has accompanied job
gains. Consumer and business confidence picked up in the first

IV-18
quarter, but both indices remain at levels well below their recent
peaks. Consumer price inflation continues to be subdued and
industrial product price inflation has slowed further.

In its May Monetary Policy Report, the Bank of Canada noted
that, although the pace of economic expansion should pick up over
the remainder of 1996, it is unlikely that slack in the economy will
be taken up until late in the year, and that downward pressure on
inflation should persist throughout the year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Real GDP growth stagnated in the first quarter of 1996 in
several major Latin American developing countries, except in Mexico.
Inflation in these countries edged upward in April. Asian real GDP
growth slowed a bit to more sustainable rates, and inflation
remained relatively flat. In Russia, real GDP fell further, and
inflation continued to decline. Trade performance continued to be
stronger in Latin America compared with a year earlier. In
contrast, the Chinese trade balance moved toward a deficit.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, recent data suggest that
economic activity continued to recover briskly in early 1996
following the estimated seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent jump (not at
an annual rate) in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 1995. The
average level of industrial production in January and February was
roughly 2 percent above its year-earlier level, compared with a 7.4
percent decline for the fourth quarter. While the improvement in
year-over-year growth rates in part reflected the decline in
activity in early 1995, the average seasonally adjusted level of
industrial output in January and February was about 6 percent above
its average level in the fourth quarter of 1995. The unemployment
rate remained essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 1995
to the first quarter of 1996, but this took place in spite of strong
seasonal factors working to increase the unemployment rate. The
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is estimated to have dropped
from about 6.7 percent to 6.1 percent. Finally, imports continued
to advance in early 1996, also pointing to a recovery of domestic
demand. Because increased imports were matched by continued export
growth, the trade balance remained essentially unchanged in the
first quarter of 1996 compared with the fourth quarter of 1995.
The CPI inflation rate rose to 2.8 percent in April, in large
part reflecting a scheduled 12 percent rise in the minimum wage and
a roughly 7 percent increase in some public sector prices.
Inflation is expected to decline in the coming months as the effects
of these increases on the economy wane and as downward seasonal
pressures come into play.

In Brazil, indications are that economic activity contracted
in the first quarter of 1996, as industrial production fell.
Inflation has remained low by Brazilian standards. The CPI
inflation rate rose in April from March, reflecting in large part an
increase in some public sector prices.

Owing to depressed aggregate demand, Brazil recorded only a
small trade deficit in the first quarter of 1996. This compares
with the sizeable trade deficit recorded at the height of a
consumption boom a year ago. Net capital inflows have slowed
considerably since early February, possibly due to the tightening of
capital controls, but also to disappointing news concerning the
economy and prospects for the government's economic reform program.
International reserves at the end of March 1996 totalled $56 billion
(liquidity concept), up considerably from a low of $32 billion a
year ago.

IV-24
In Argentina, real GDP contracted by 4.4 percent in 1995, and
industrial production fell further in the first quarter. Consumer
prices fell in the first quarter, the first time since W.W.II. The
trade balance turned to a surplus in February and March, due to a 30
percent increase in exports and a 7.6 percent fall in imports from a
year earlier. International reserves less gold and securities have
recovered from last year's drain and were $13.8 billion at end-
April, compared with $14.3 at the end of 1994. Of the $18 billion
in gross reserves, $2.7 billion are in dollar-denominated Bonex
bonds. The monetary base was $12 billion, leaving $6 billion in
excess reserves.

Argentina's Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF
expired on March 30, 1996. In early April, the IMF approved a new
21-month stand-by arrangement for $1.04 billion equivalent.
Argentina met its first-quarter fiscal target with the IMF by a
small margin, which calls for a $2.5 billion budget deficit without
privatizations in 1996. On April 16, Argentina resumed auctioning
91-day Treasury instruments renamed LETES. The first in a series of
planned auctions for the year was for $271 million at 6.9 percent
and was almost 8 times oversubscribed. The government plans to
issue net $2 billion in LETES in 1996, $750 million of which will be
auctioned in the first half of the year. The initial tenor of 3
months will gradually be lengthened during the course of the year to
include 6- and 12-month maturities.
In Venezuela, consumer price inflation picked up in April due
to the liberalization of exchange controls and the depreciation of

IV-25
the bolivar. Venezuela registered a merchandise (non-oil) trade
deficit of $6 billion in 1995, reflecting a 34 percent increase in
imports and an 8 percent increase in exports. However, the overall
trade balance, including oil exports, showed a $7.8 billion surplus.

In April, Venezuela introduced a new macroeconomic
stabilization program put together with the IMF. The reforms
included a comprehensive liberalization of exchange, price, and
interest rate controls as well as an increase in gasoline prices by
an average of 467 percent and an increase in the wholesale tax from
12.5 to 16.5 percent. The bolivar was allowed to float on April 22
and immediately went from a fixed rate of 290 per dollar to about
500 per dollar. Over the next few days, as the Central Bank
intervened in the money market, the currency appreciated slightly,
and as of May 16, was about 475 per dollar. Interest rates have
also increased significantly from the previous floor of 23 percent
for deposits and ceiling of 47 percent for loans to around 50-55
percent for deposits and 75-85 percent for loans.
On the same day that the reforms were announced, the IMF
declared that it had reached an agreement on all the main policies
with Venezuela for a $1.4 billion equivalent 12-month stand-by
arrangement. A letter of intent has been completed. The IMF loan
will be part of an estimated $3.3 billion multilateral support
package for Venezuela, with contributions from the World Bank ($900
million) and the IDB (about $1 billion).
In China, real GDP growth remained strong in the first
quarter, while inflation was relatively flat at nearly 10 percent.
Strong import growth and negative export growth have shifted the
trade balance into a deficit in recent months. China's trade

IV-26
deficit of $0.7 billion in the January-April period compares with a
surplus of $8.8 billion in the same period of 1995. The dollar
value of exports fell 8 percent from a year earlier, while imports
rose 18 percent.

In early April, China began open market operations. However,
given the limited quantity of tradeable treasury bills on the market
as well as the continuing system of credit quotas and mandated
interest rates, these open market operations are likely to remain
small and largely experimental for some time to come.
In Taiwan, political events have substantially affected
economic and financial market developments. Chinese missile tests
near Taiwan in February and March led to substantial capital
outflows; foreign exchange reserves, which fell $8 billion in March
1996 alone, stood at $85 billion at the end of April, down from a
high of $100 billion in June 1995. Industrial production stagnated
and inflation declined somewhat in the first quarter.

Following Taiwan's presidential election March 23, tensions
with China have lessened, and downward pressure on the currency has
abated. Taiwan's stock market, which fell 10 percent from the

IV-27
beginning of 1996 to its low point in early March, has surged. As
of May 16, the stock market was up 18 percent for the year.
In Korea, there is clear evidence that economic growth is
slowing. Industrial production has decelerated markedly since the
third quarter of last year. Slow growth in capital goods imports--
which increased by only 4 percent on a year-over-year basis in
March--suggests a particularly sharp deceleration in investment
demand. Given that inflation has remained moderate by historical
standards, the Bank of Korea has eased monetary policy progressively
since the middle of last year. Short-term interest rates have
fallen by around 500 basis points since the end of June, with about
one third of the decline occurring in the past two months.

An initial review of Korea's OECD application by the
Committees on Capital Movements and Invisibles Transactions (CMIT)
and on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises
(CIME)--the committees responsible for assessing Korea's adherence
to OECD standards with regard to capital account openness and trade
in services--was held on April 11-12. These committees indicated
that Korea must commit to significantly more financial
liberalization before they can recommend that Korea be admitted to
the OECD. The CMIT/CIME review noted that Korea continues to
maintain substantial barriers to foreign direct investment, to
foreign competition in the provision of financial services, and to
capital inflows.
In Russia, monthly inflation continued to decline. The ruble
depreciated against the dollar by 2 percent during April, similar to
its performance in recent months, remaining comfortably within its
4550-5150 rubles per dollar band. In mid-May, the government

IV-28
announced that, effective July 1, the current band will be replaced
by a crawling band. Both the ceiling and the floor of the new band
will depreciate by about 1.5 percent a month. During the first four
months of 1996, real GDP and industrial production were both down 3
percent from their year-earlier levels. Russian officials have
linked the continued decline in economic activity to "under
investment," reflecting concerns about the June 16 presidential
election.

Russia successfully completed its first monthly review under
its IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), satisfying all the
quantitative indicative targets for end-March. In particular, the
fiscal deficit during the first quarter was 5 percent of GDP, just
under the program ceiling, despite unexpectedly poor revenue
performance and pressures to increase expenditures as the election
approaches. Delays in implementing some of the program's prior
actions were resolved to the Fund's satisfaction by end-April.
In late April, the Russian government signed an agreement with
the Paris Club of official creditors restructuring $40 billion of
the roughly $45 billion in official debt that Russia inherited from
the Soviet Union. The implementation of the rescheduling agreement
is explicitly contingent on Russia satisfying the conditions of the
EFF.
