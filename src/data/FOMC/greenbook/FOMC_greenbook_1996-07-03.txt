DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity apparently advanced at a relatively brisk
clip this spring. With the inventory imbalances that held back
output earlier in the year largely corrected, industrial production
posted large gains in April and May. Furthermore, a healthy
underlying trend in income growth lent support to consumer spending.
However, some tentative signs have emerged that higher mortgage
rates are beginning to damp residential construction and that growth
in business capital spending is moderating. Although there is some
evidence that wage pressures are mounting, the incoming data
indicate that core price inflation has remained in check at both the
consumer and producer levels.
Labor markets
The economy has continued to generate an impressive number of
jobs. Nonfarm payrolls expanded an average of 222,000 jobs per
month over the first five months of the year, driven primarily by
growth in the service-producing and construction industries.
Employment jumped 348,000 in May, and the gain in April was revised
up sharply, to 163,000.
The establishment survey data released last month incorporated
annual benchmark revisions and the use of a new seasonal adjustment
1process. The benchmarking raised the not seasonally adjusted
level of employment in March 1995 by 542,000, a large revision by
historical standards but in line with the preliminary estimate that
the BLS announced last November. In addition, the average monthly
change in seasonally adjusted employment between March 1995 and
February 1996 was raised about 30,000; revised bias adjustment
factors accounted for the bulk of this additional revision since
March 1995.
In contrast to the strong gains in employment, growth in
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers has been
relatively subdued this spring. Aggregate hours rose 0.1 percent in
May after declining 0.2 percent in April. The blizzard effects in
1. Three important features of the annual revisions to the
establishment survey are the benchmarking of payroll employment to
the March 1995 unemployment insurance tax records; a concomitant
revision to the bias adjustment factors for employment after March
1995 (used primarily to account for new establishments not captured
by BLS's survey techniques); and the introduction of the new X-12
seasonal adjustment procedure that, among other things, corrects for
differences in the length of time between monthly surveys (the so-
called four- and five-week effect).

the first quarter make the usual quarter-to-quarter hours
comparisons difficult. Cutting through that difficulty, hours in
May were 1.6 percent (annual rate) above the fourth-quarter level--
an increase that would be quite reasonably aligned with the close to
3 percent first-half GDP growth anticipated by many forecasters.
(Productivity was weak in the fourth quarter of 1995, so an above-
trend increase in productivity in the first half would not be
surprising.)
In the household survey, the unemployment rate has fluctuated
between 5.4 percent and 5.8 percent since late 1994. The rate in
May, 5.6 percent, equaled the average for the year to date. Labor
force participation averaged 66.7 percent during the first five
months of 1996, a slightly higher rate than in 1995. In May, labor
force participation jumped 0.3 percentage point, to 66.9 percent,
the high end of the recent range of fluctuation. Participation
rates rose last month for all demographic groups, but especially
teenagers, where variations in the timing of seasonal inflows into
the labor force can make participation rates volatile in the spring.
Other indicators also point to a strong labor market. Initial
claims for unemployment insurance averaged 358,000 over the four
weeks ended June 15, a shade below the average of the first five
months of 1996. The adjusted Conference Board help-wanted index
(confidential until 10:00 a.m. Thursday, June 27) fell 0.8 point in
May, but remained in the narrow range that has prevailed since mid-
1994. In the latest Manpower survey, the net percentage of firms
planning to boost hiring turned up after having declined fairly
steadily over the preceding year. The Conference Board consumer
survey readings on perceived job availability have remained in the
ranges observed since the end of 1994, although these levels are
somewhat less favorable than those during the period in 1988 when
the jobless rate also was in the neighborhood of 5-1/2 percent.
Revised estimates of output growth lowered the large jump in
nonfarm business sector productivity in the first quarter from
2.6 percent to 2.1 percent (annual rates). First-quarter growth in
nonfarm business compensation per hour, at a 3.3 percent annual
rate, was unchanged by the revisions. Unit labor costs were revised
up some in the first quarter, but the change over the past four
quarters was still a moderate 2.4 percent.
In addition to revisions to the national income accounts, the
productivity and cost data incorporated the recent revisions to the

establishment survey as well as technical adjustments to data from
the household survey. The four-quarter change in compensation per
hour in 1995 was revised down 1/2 percentage point, to 3.6 percent,
more in line with the ECI than the previous estimate. Productivity
growth in 1995 and early 1996 also was revised down about
1/2 percentage point (annual rate). Over the longer run, however,
the underlying trend in the growth of output per hour was little
changed; since the business cycle peak in 1990, productivity is now
estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 1.05 percent,
0.1 percentage point less than previously estimated.
Only a little information on second-quarter labor costs
currently is available, but the data that have come in seem to be
providing some statistical confirmation of the many anecdotal
reports of rising wage pressures. Average hourly earnings of
production and nonsupervisory workers increased 3.3 percent during
the year ended this May, up from a 2-3/4 percent pace average during
the second quarter of 1995.2 More comprehensive second-quarter
wage and salary data from the ECI will be available in late July;
through the first quarter, longer-term movements in ECI wages and
salaries were broadly in sync with those in average hourly earnings.
Industrial Production
According to preliminary estimates, industrial production rose
0.7 percent in May, matching the April advance. However, in
contrast with April, when much of the increase resulted from the
return to work at GM, the gain in May was broader based. A weather-
related spurt in electricity generation accounted for about one-
third of last month's advance. Much of the remainder of the
increase occurred in manufacturing output excluding motor vehicles
and parts, which rose 0.5 percent in May after having been unchanged
in each of the two preceding months. With the exception of consumer
goods, advances were widespread across market groups; the most
notable gains were in the production of business equipment and
durable goods materials.
Production of motor vehicles remained strong in May.
Assemblies were 12.2 million units at an annual rate, the same pace
as in April. Brisk sales in April and May, along with some

hourly earnings series were recalculated as a result of revisions to
payroll employment. Although the revisions do not seem to greatly
alter the longer-run pattern of average hourly earnings growth, the
new data point to a steeper rise in earnings over the past few
months.

lingering effects of the GM strike, have left inventories of light
motor vehicles at relatively lean levels. As a result, automakers
set assembly schedules for June at a robust 12.4 million unit pace,
and their current plans would hold production at a similar clip in
the third quarter.

Apart from motor vehicles, the production of manufactured
consumer goods was flat in May. The output of business equipment
increased again last month: Information processing equipment made
another sizable advance, and, in contrast to the previous two
months, industrial equipment also moved up. The gains for
industrial equipment are consistent with the pickup in new orders
for these items earlier in the year. The output of construction
supplies rose 0.3 percent last month, extending the recovery that
began last fall. The production of materials surged 0.7 percent in
May, reflecting gains in durable goods materials, particularly
semiconductors, computer parts, and miscellaneous plastic materials.
Forward-looking indicators of industrial activity suggest
moderate growth in the near term. New orders for durable goods,
adjusted for inflation and excluding orders that are not closely
related to near-term activity, rose 1.0 percent in May following a
1.5 percent advance in April. The orders and production components
of the National Purchasing Managers' indexes remained on the
positive side for a second consecutive month. Other private surveys
also indicate that manufacturers expect moderate growth over the
coming three months.3
3. The strike at the McDonnell Douglas plant that started on
June 5 affects only about 6,700 workers and is expected to have a
minor effect on industrial production.

The factory utilization rate rose to 82.0 percent of capacity
in May, the same as in the fourth quarter of last year and not much
above its 1967-95 average of 81.4 percent. In primary-processing
industries, however, the utilization rate continues to be
substantially above its long-run average.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light motor vehicles jumped to 15.8 million units at
an annual rate in May, a monthly gain of about 1-1/4 million units.
Sales were pushed up about 1/4 million units by an increase in GM
fleet sales (confidential), which had been fairly low the previous
few months. In addition, Toyota, Honda, and Mazda included about
300,000 units (annual rate) of June sales in their May report.
So far in 1996, sales have averaged a 15.1 million unit pace, a
little better than the 1994-95 level. Demand for light trucks has
remained high, and continued use of incentive packages evidently has
helped to maintain favorable views of prevailing car-buying
conditions among consumers. Automakers have been a bit surprised by
the strength of demand and have upped their sales forecasts for the
year by 100,000 to 200,000 units; automakers' forecasts for light
motor vehicle sales in 1996 now are a shade above the 15 million
unit mark.
The demand for medium and heavy trucks, however, has continued
to be soft so far this year. North American orders net of
cancellations for truck classes 5 through 8 have averaged about
20,000 units a month, about the same as the 1995 average, but much
lower than in 1993 and 1994. Backlogs have fallen from a peak of
9.5 months in April 1995 to 3.4 months in May 1996. This drop in
backlogs has begun to show up in production, which has fallen
7-3/4 percent so far in 1996 from its average level in the fourth
quarter of 1995. Industry analysts expect further declines in
production.
Personal Income and Consumption
Total nominal retail sales rose 0.8 percent in May after
slipping slightly in April. Nominal spending in the retail control
category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and at building
material and supply stores, moved up 0.2 percent in May following a
substantially upward-revised gain of 0.9 percent in April. On
balance, the retail sales data, together with the available

information about prices, suggest that the average level in April
and May of real consumer spending on goods excluding motor vehicles
was about 0.9 percent above its first-quarter average, not at an
annual rate.
Spending on services has advanced moderately, on net, in recent
months. Real services expenditures were about flat in April after
rising 0.6 percent in March. Expenditures for non-energy services
increased modestly in April, with small gains in most major
categories. In contrast, spending on energy services declined in
April, as temperatures returned to more-normal levels after the
unusually cold March. This pattern likely was reversed in May, with
spending on electricity probably rising in response to unseasonable
temperatures during the month.
Total personal income posted a sizable advance in April;
nonetheless, disposable personal income fell 1/2 percent, reflecting
a large increase in personal tax payments associated with the third
(and final) installment on 1993 tax liabilities incurred by high-
income taxpayers under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993. Despite the April decline, real disposable personal
income was almost 2-3/4 percent above the level of a year ago
(disposable income also was reduced in April 1995 by OBRA 1993-
related payments). The saving rate fell to 3.7 percent in April
after averaging 4.6 percent in the first quarter. However,
disposable income and the saving rate should rebound in May with tax
payments returning to more normal levels.
The latest reports on consumer sentiment exhibited divergent
readings but continue to indicate positive attitudes among
households. According to the preliminary report, the Michigan SRC
index of consumer sentiment posted a moderate gain in early June and
now stands above the midpoint of the relatively favorable range seen
since early 1994. The early June increase reflected substantially
more sanguine views of future conditions, which more than offset a
5. BEA generally spreads tax payments equally across the year in
the seasonally adjusted NIPA data; however, exceptions are made for
payments that it considers unusual. The installment payments on the
OBRA 1993 tax liabilities were considered unusual. In contrast, the
surprisingly large payments of nonwithheld personal income taxes in
the unified budget in April (discussed in the section below on the
federal sector) were not considered unusual, and thus they will have
little effect on the month-to-month changes in NIPA tax payments for
1996. Indeed, BEA has already started to spread these payments out,
raising its estimate of first-quarter nonwithheld taxes by
$12 billion between the preliminary and advance GDP estimates.

deterioration in respondents' assessments of current conditions. In
contrast, the June Conference Board report shows a considerable
decline in the index for consumer sentiment, but it remained in the
middle of the favorable range seen over the past couple of years.
Household wealth has been bolstered this year by the further
rise in stock prices, and, to a lesser degree, a pickup in the
appreciation of house prices. The most recent balance sheet data
are for the first quarter; these data indicate that assets increased
far more than liabilities and that the ratio of total household net
worth to disposable income climbed to 5.1, its highest level in more
than two decades. Given the further increase in stock and house
prices this spring, household net worth likely has risen further in
the second quarter.
Given the solid income growth and the surge in wealth since the
beginning of 1995, it is perhaps surprising that consumer spending
has grown at an annual rate of only about 2-1/2 percent over this
period. One possibility, of course, is that the income or spending
data could be revised significantly at some point. But taking
current data at face value, it is possible that, in a significant
portion of the household sector, financial pressures associated with
rising debt-service obligations have tempered spending growth
somewhat. Rising delinquency rates for consumer loans suggest that
some households have had problems meeting their debt-service
payments. However, this rise in delinquencies most likely
exaggerates the degree of real financial stress because lenders have
made credit available to lower-income or otherwise riskier
households that previously were deemed unqualified. Another factor
that may have limited the response of household spending to recent
wealth gains is an increase in precautionary saving in response to
heightened concerns about job security or the adequacy of retirement
income.
Housing Markets
Housing starts declined in May from the high April level.
Single-family starts fell 6 percent, to a 1.13 million unit annual
rate, the slowest pace since last November. This decline in starts
suggests that the rise in mortgage rates in recent months has begun
to damp construction activity. Some confirmation can be found in
consumer attitudes toward homebuying, which have turned slightly
less favorable since March, mainly reflecting a more widespread
perception that mortgage rates are high. In addition, although

still relatively low, the proportion of conventional home mortgages
with adjustable rate features picked up noticeably in April; a shift
toward ARM financing is typical in a market in which households are
attempting to lessen the impact of higher mortgage rates on loan
qualification and housing affordability.
The starts figures, however, may overstate the magnitude of the
drop in building. Permit issuance for single-family units--a
statistically more accurate figure than housing starts--also
declined in May, but only 2 percent; starts were abnormally low
relative to the level of permits. Moreover, sales of existing homes
were strong through May. Through early June, home builders
assessments of new home sales and applications for mortgages to
finance home purchases also continued to indicate strength in the
single-family market.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts were unchanged in
May, continuing the flat pattern of the past year and a half. At
the national level, construction appears to have outpaced demand.
The vacancy rate for multifamily rental housing has risen in the
past two quarters (relative to year-earlier levels), and the
absorption rate for rental apartments declined in 1995 after having
risen in the four preceding years.
Shipments of mobile homes, which grew rapidly between 1991 and
1995, have picked up noticeably again in recent months. In April,
shipments reached 378,000 units at an annual rate, a twenty-two year
high.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth in business fixed investment appears to be slowing in
the current quarter. Earlier this year, such outlays surged,
reflecting an explosion in computer expenditures and fairly strong
gains in most of the other major categories. However, indicators
for the current quarter point to more modest gains in both equipment
outlays and nonresidential structures.
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and
parts were little changed in May after dropping 3.3 percent in
April. However, shipments of these goods retraced half of their
April decline. Among the major components, both orders and
shipments of computing equipment have been quite volatile in recent
months, but they continue to trend upward at a hefty clip--with
shipments standing 10 percent above a year earlier in nominal terms.
Bookings for communications equipment declined sharply for the

second month in a row. Despite the drop in orders, however,
shipments of communications equipment turned up in May; the pickup
likely reflects the rise in backlogs that occurred in the first
quarter when orders for communications equipment jumped
7-1/2 percent while shipments declined. Orders for other nondefense
capital goods (that is, for nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft, computers, and communications equipment) were little
changed in May after declining in the previous two months.
Shipments of these goods edged up in May.
On balance, the fundamental determinants of capital spending
are pointing to less-robust gains in equipment outlays in coming
quarters. In the current expansion, the accelerator--represented in
the chart by the change in the eight-quarter growth rate of business
output--peaked in 1993, and has waned since then. Growth in cash
flow also has moderated substantially over the past two years.
Econometric models that incorporate these factors predicted the 1995
deceleration in PDE and expect yet slower growth in coming quarters.
Only the cost of capital is currently sending an upbeat signal;
factoring in typical lag relationships, the sharp decline in
interest rates last year and the ready availability of equity
financing ought to be providing considerable support for investment
during the first half of this year. However, the backup in
corporate borrowing rates in recent months would be expected to
exert a drag on investment late this year and in 1997.
With regard to computers, many industry analysts expect growth
in unit shipments of personal computers to cool off in 1996, to a
rate somewhere around 15 percent, about 10 percentage points less
than the 1995 gain. While this number may seem optimistic given the
recent slower growth in computer spending, our contacts are looking
for considerable strength in the latter part of this year, in large
part because they expect businesses will upgrade their hardware to
take full advantage of a new version of Windows NT due out late this
summer. Moving upstream, DRAM prices are still quite weak, and
given the spurt in capacity during the past nine months or so, a
substantial rebound in memory prices is not likely for some time.
Disk drive makers also appear to have had overly optimistic demand
forecasts and currently are burdened with unsold inventories and
excess production capacity.
Spending for real nonresidential structures, after rising
5 percent in 1995, recorded a strong advance in the first quarter of

this year. Construction put-in-place for these structures rose
1-1/2 percent in April after a 1 percent gain in March. Upbeat
anecdotal reports in the Beige Book are consistent with the recent
gains in nonresidential construction. Vacancy rates for office
buildings, which have improved markedly in recent years, fell
further in the first quarter. The National Real Estate Index
indicates that transactions prices for both office buildings and
warehouses continued to rise through the first quarter of this year,
while prices of retail structures flattened out.
Despite these favorable current conditions, the data on
contracts, which are another set of leading indicators of
nonresidential construction, have soured in all the major building
categories. Declines have been especially pronounced in the office
and industrial sectors. The drop in contracts in the industrial
sector is not surprising, given that capacity utilization has
receded to more normal levels during the past year or so. In
addition, contracts for "other commercial" structures (including
retail stores) have turned down in recent months; this sector
appears to be burdened by excess retail floor space in many parts of
the country.
Inventories
The condition of business inventories improved considerably by
April. Manufacturers made significant progress in reducing their
stock imbalances, while wholesale and retail trade inventories have
remained at satisfactory levels in most areas and even appeared lean
in some sectors.
Restrained output during the first quarter and increased
shipments in March and April helped to clear away manufacturers
excess stocks. In several industries and market groupings--primary
metals, textiles, printing and publishing, and household durables--
correction efforts had, by early in the second quarter, returned
inventory-shipments ratios to levels well below their recent highs.
However, in a few other industries--notably chemicals and paper--
inventories remained on the high side in April and may need to be
trimmed further. For producers of capital goods, whose orders and
shipments have been well maintained over the past year, inventory
accumulation resumed in April after a brief interruption in March.
The inventory-shipments ratio for capital equipment as a group was
relatively low in April, but with orders for these items flattening,

1. The April inventory-shipments ratio is near its recent peak.
Trade establishments began to make significant progress in
gaining control of inventories last year. In wholesale trade,
scattered inventory paring occurred as early as November and
continued through February. In retail trade, inventories were
reduced sharply in December; further liquidations, largely in
nondurable stocks, were observed again in March. With but a few
exceptions (notably, furniture and appliances in retail trade, and
hardware and plumbing in wholesale trade), the inventory-sales
ratios for most types of trade establishments in April were at or
near the lower range of their recent readings. It is worth noting
that retail general merchandise and apparel stores, where serious
imbalances often have occurred in the past, have been able to keep
their stocks well under control since late last year.
Federal Sector
On a unified basis, the federal government recorded a budget
surplus of $19 billion in April and May, compared with a $10 billion
surplus a year ago. The adjusted surplus, which corrects for shifts
in the timing of certain outlays and excludes net outlays
attributable to deposit insurance and spectrum auctions, was up
$22 billion from last year.
Outlays in April and May continued to rebound from the low
levels seen earlier in the year. For the first six months of the
fiscal year ended in March, adjusted outlays had risen 1.7 percent
from a year earlier: strong outlays in April and May brought year-
over-year growth to 2.8 percent for the first eight months of the

fiscal year. The April-May surge was concentrated in defense and
Medicare and other health outlays, categories that tend to move
erratically on a short-term basis.
Unified receipts continue to show strong growth. Increases in
profits have pushed corporate profit tax receipts up 11 percent so
far this fiscal year relative to last. Individual income taxes also
have grown at a strong pace. Indeed, the data received since the
May Greenbook confirm a sharp rise in individual tax liabilities in
1995 and early 1996 that appears stronger than can be explained by
personal income growth alone. According to Monthly Treasury
Statements, personal nonwithheld income taxes--which primarily
reflect final payments on 1995 liabilities but also include the
first quarterly estimated payments for 1996--were up 30 percent
($22 billion) in April and May from a year earlier. This increase
comes on the heels of a 9 percent rise in withheld tax payments last
year. This elevated growth in individual tax receipts seems to be
explained in part by the run-up in financial asset prices, which may
have fueled strong capital gains realizations.
The CBO released The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years
1997-2006 in late May. The report included little information that
was not contained in preliminary figures released in March and
April. At that time, CBO's official deficit estimate for fiscal
1996 was $144 billion. After these estimates were finalized in mid-
April, more-recent information concerning final appropriations bills
for fiscal 1996 and stronger-than-expected April receipts reportedly
has caused CBO to lower its expected deficit for fiscal 1996 to
$130 billion.6
On June 13, the Congress approved a six-year budget resolution
that projects a $5 billion surplus in fiscal 2002. The agreement
includes $575 billion in net budget savings from policy changes over
the six years--$637 billion in direct spending cuts and $48 billion
in debt-service reduction offset in part by $111 billion in tax
cuts. About half the reduction in outlays is in mandatory programs,
primarily Medicare and other health programs. The resolution also
calls for a 9 percent reduction ($297 billion) in discretionary
spending. The plan provides for three separate reconciliation bills
for mandatory programs and taxes. The first is for welfare and
Medicaid, the second is for Medicare, and the third is for taxes.
6. This figure was given by CBO Director June O'Neill in comments
reported by the Bureau of National Affairs, Daily Report,
May 22, 1996.

II-32
Committee work on these bills is targeted for completion in June,
July, and September respectively. Welfare and Medicaid reform is
already behind schedule, as committee work continues in the House
despite a targeted completion date of June 13.

2. Includes debt-service savings from the direct effects of policy
changes on the deficit.
3. Represents the deficit reduction estimated to result from
macroeconomic effects of adopting policies to balance the budget in
2002.
According to CBO estimates, the congressional budget resolution
would produce essentially the same deficit outcome for fiscal 1997
as would the President's plan, although the congressional proposal
contains bigger spending cuts offset by somewhat larger net tax
cuts. Over the longer run, the budget resolution contains
substantially more deficit reduction than the President's basic
plan. However, if the contingent out-year deficit reduction in the
President's plan were to be invoked, it too would produce a small
surplus by 2002.
State and Local Government Sector
Real spending by state and local governments exhibited strength
during the early months of the second quarter; these gains are
coming on the heels of a previous rebound in spending from weather-
depressed levels earlier in the year. Real construction spending
rose 1.3 percent in April. The increase primarily reflects the
building of sewer and water supply systems; construction of most
other categories declined. Government employment jumped 45,000 in
May following a small advance the month before. A little less than
half of the May increase reflected temporary hiring of election
workers to staff polls in Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, North
Carolina, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia

II-33
With fiscal year 1996 ending on June 30, most states appear to
have passed their fiscal 1997 budgets. According to a recent survey
by the National Association of State Budget Officers, states are
planning to increase general fund spending only 1.8 percent in
fiscal 1997, the smallest advance in fourteen years. Several
states--most notably New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania--are
expected to reduce spending. The slowdown in spending appears to
reflect both the desire to downsize government and the expectation
that federal aid will be reduced.
A number of states--California, Hawaii, New York, Rhode Island,
and Vermont--plan to reduce welfare spending in fiscal 1997. In
all, thirty-seven states have received federal waivers to adopt
limits on the amount of time an individual may receive welfare
payments or to impose other restrictions such as stringent work
requirements. Most states are relying more heavily on managed care
to gain better control of their Medicaid expenditures, but, to date,
only a few have undertaken fundamental restructuring of their
programs.
Prices
The incoming data on prices have continued to be favorable.
The underlying rate of inflation, as measured by the twelve-month
change in the CPI excluding food and energy, edged down to
2-3/4 percent in May, and, with the exception of some food and
energy commodities, price pressures at earlier stages of processing
remain subdued. Increases in broad measures of prices--such as the
chain price indexes for GDP and gross domestic purchases--also show
a pattern of stability or moderation relative to 1995.
The most recent inflation readings have been dominated by
developments in energy and food prices. Energy prices continued to
rise rapidly at the retail level in April and May, largely
reflecting higher prices for gasoline. Looking ahead, the Lundberg
survey of retail gasoline prices, which is not seasonally adjusted,
shows that prices fell 1.4 percent in the first three weeks of June,
even though gasoline prices typically rise fairly rapidly this time
of year. This decline reflects a drop in the price of crude oil in
May.

1. Excluding housing.
Food prices for consumers inched up 0.1 percent in May after
increasing at a faster pace in the previous two months. The run-up
in grain prices has had some divergent effects on prices of consumer
foods. The index for cereals and bakery products rose 0.6 percent
in May despite the first round of highly publicized cuts in
breakfast cereal prices, and price increases for both poultry and
pork exceeded 1 percent. In contrast, beef prices dropped
1.7 percent, reflecting increased slaughter in response to higher
feed prices.
At the commodity level, spot prices for farm crops, while still
quite high, have come down since the May Greenbook. Wheat prices
have retraced about two-thirds of their run-up earlier this year, as
a slight improvement in crop conditions and lower-than-expected pre-
harvest usage have combined to take the edge off of the market.
Spot prices for corn also have dropped on news of small cutbacks in
current usage. By contrast, futures prices for post-harvest
contracts of corn have been pushed up slightly by indications that
wet weather will prevent some acreage from being planted. Livestock
prices remain mixed. Hog prices have weakened appreciably after an

II-36
earlier run-up, but cattle prices, which were quite weak earlier in
the spring, have held fairly steady in spot markets and firmed in
futures markets over the past few weeks.
Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased 0.2 percent
in May following a 0.1 percent rise in April. The index for
commodities other than food and energy was unchanged last month,
while prices of non-energy services rose 0.3 percent, the same as
the average increase in the first four months of 1996. Over the
twelve months ended in May, core consumer prices rose 2.7 percent,
compared with 3.1 percent over the year ended in May 1995. Sharp
swings in auto finance charges accounted for most of this
deceleration; the twelve-month change in core CPI excluding this
item edged down from 2.9 percent in May 1995 to 2.8 percent in May
1996.
CPI inflation generally has been higher than the rate of change
in PCE prices as measured in the NIPA, particularly over the past
year. Between early 1992 and early 1995, the CPI rose roughly
1/4 percentage point faster than the PCE deflator, but over the past
year, the gap increased to 3/4 percentage point. Medical services
accounted for most of this larger differential. Both PCE and CPI
medical services prices rose 4-1/2 percent to 5 percent between
1994:Q1 and 1995:Q1; since then, medical services prices increased
about 4 percent in the CPI but rose less than 2 percent in the PCE
deflator. The prices of medical services are measured more
accurately in the PCE measure than in the CPI. The CPI tends to
follow "list" prices and costs out "inputs" into the health care
process, such as a one-day stay in a hospital bed. In contrast, the
PCE deflator measures actual transactions prices and captures more
comprehensive "treatment paths." Medical services have a larger
weight in PCE than they do in the CPI: The weights in PCE measure
more up-to-date spending patterns and include employer- or
government-paid insurance; the CPI weights are based on 1982-84
expenditure patterns and consider only out-of-pocket expenses or
household-paid insurance.
7. In January 1997 BLS plans to change the CPI for medical
services so that it will measure transactions prices and follow
treatment paths. If this move had taken place earlier, the staff
estimates that the change in core CPI over the twelve months ended
in May 1995 would have been roughly 0.1 percentage point lower,
while core inflation over the period ended in May 1996 would have
been reduced by about 0.2 percentage point.

II-37
At the producer level, the PPI for finished goods excluding
food and energy was flat in May and changed little on net over the
first five months of 1996. The PPI for intermediate materials
excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent in May, the first monthly
increase since August of last year. Despite last month's uptick,
the index for core intermediate materials remains 1 percent below
its level of a year ago--down sharply from the 7.9 percent increase
recorded over the previous twelve-month period. Prices for crude
materials other than food and energy fell 0.3 percent in May,
bringing the twelve-month drop in core crude materials prices to
12.5 percent. Since mid-May, both the Journal of Commerce and
KR-CRB price indexes for industrial commodities have declined, as
metals prices have fallen considerably. However, a large part of
the decline reflects the plunge in copper prices following the
revelation of the trading scandal at Sumitomo.
Recent surveys of consumers show that mean inflation
expectations dropped back after jumping in May. Mean expected
inflation over the next twelve months fell to 4.3 percent in the
preliminary June Michigan Survey of Consumers, 1/2 percentage point
lower than the previous month. Nevertheless, this survey reading
remains 1/4 percentage point higher than its level of a year ago.
Median expected inflation, a less volatile series, edged down to
2.9 percent in June, its average over the past year. Longer-term
expectations improved more than year-ahead expectations: Mean
expected inflation over the next five to ten years was 3.7 percent
in the June survey, down more than 1 percentage point from May and
1/2 percentage point from June 1995. Among professional
forecasters, the ten-year inflation expectations compiled by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia was 3 percent in June; this
index has been unchanged since last summer.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Against a backdrop of unchanged reserve market conditions,
intermediate- and long-term interest rates have risen about 30 basis
points since the May FOMC meeting, placing the yield on the thirty-
year Treasury bond once again above 7 percent. Although there was
some good news on price inflation during the intermeeting period,
incoming information pointing to an economy growing rather briskly
led market participants to raise the odds on a tightening of
monetary policy to avoid overheating. Rates on near-term federal
funds futures contracts now seem to embody expectations that the
federal funds rate will be raised 25 basis points at some point this
summer (chart). Yields on private securities generally followed
those on Treasuries, preserving the narrow spreads of the past
couple of months, and junk bond spreads have shrunk another 10 basis
points since the May FOMC meeting.
Equity prices have zigzagged in recent weeks. The Dow and the
S&P 500 indexes are off about 1/2 percent on net since the last FOMC
meeting. However, the NASDAQ composite index has dropped 6 percent,
in part reflecting concerns about the earnings of technology firms.
Nonetheless, equity prices remain high in relation to earnings.
The growth of debt of nonfederal sectors has remained moderate
in recent months. Business loan growth at banks has held up well,
and bond issuance has dipped only a little to date in response to
the backup in interest rates. In the household sector, consumer
credit growth appears to have slowed a bit further in the current
quarter, while mortgage borrowing appears to have been fairly well
maintained. State and local government debt outstanding has
continued to contract: Although gross issuance has risen a bit,
retirements of prerefunded bonds have remained large. Borrowing by
the federal government has been weak in the second quarter--indeed,
negative on an unadjusted basis--as unusually strong tax receipts
produced a surplus in the period.
Market and other indicators suggest that credit generally has
been amply available to both business and household borrowers. Rate
spreads on corporate debt are quite low, with junk bond spreads at
their lowest levels in a decade. In addition, surveys and anecdotal
reports indicate that banks remain aggressive in competing for
business customers. And although emerging signs of some
deterioration in household credit quality have raised caution flags

among banks and other lenders, especially credit card and affordable
housing lenders, it appears that any tightening of credit terms and
standards to date has been selectively focused.
Money and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates were weak in May: M2 fell at a
1-1/2 percent annual rate and M3 grew at only a 3-1/2 percent rate.
However, partial data for June point to a rebound, leaving M2
slightly below and M3 slightly above the upper ends of their
respective annual growth ranges.
The weakness in M2 in May likely owed in part to the rise in
the opportunity cost of holding deposits in previous months as
intermediate- and long-term market interest rates rose. In
addition, individuals most likely tapped other checkable deposits
(OCDs) and savings deposits to make the unusually large tax payments
recorded by the Treasury in the second half of April, as evidenced
by the decline in OCDs, even after accounting for sweeps, and the
marked slowdown in inflows to savings deposits. Because of the
sharp drop in OCDs, M1 fell at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in May
despite a pickup in the growth of currency and demand deposits.
Adjusted for retail sweeps, M1 increased at a little more than a
2 percent rate.
Bank credit rose at only a 1-1/2 percent pace in May, well
below the 5 percent growth registered on average in late 1995 and
early 1996. Asset growth in May was depressed in part by the
effects of accounting rules.1 However, even after adjusting for
these accounting effects, bank credit was up at only a 2-1/2 percent
annual rate in May, but it appears to have strengthened a bit in
June.
Bank loans contracted slightly in May, with all categories weak
except business loans. Consumer loans ran off at a 5-3/4 percent
pace. However, the reported bank data overstate the weakening in
consumer lending because bookings have been bounced around in
response to transfers of receivables between a large finance company
and its bank affiliate that boosted consumer loans in April but
lowered them in May, and because banks continue to remove
receivables from their books through securitization. Adjusting for
1. The rules mandate the booking of changes in the market value
of bank securities and the booking of the revaluation gains in
derivative portfolios in "other securities." The rise in interest
rates reduced both the value of securities and the revaluation
gains.

these transactions suggests that the underlying rate of growth of
consumer lending at banks averaged about 5 percent at an annual rate
over April and May, well below the pace in the first quarter. Real
estate loans were flat in May, likely reflecting securitization
rather than a lack of originations. Data for the first part of June
suggest that the pace of consumer and real estate lending has picked
up.
Business loans grew at a 7 percent annual rate in May, off
slightly from April though still above the average in the first
quarter; partial data for June point to a further slowing. The
downtick in May possibly reflected a shift to capital market
financing when long-term rates stabilized and then edged lower for a
time. The Survey of Terms of Bank Lending for May indicated that
banks continued to be accommodative lenders, as spreads on large
loans ($1 million and over) remained fairly narrow by historical
standards--although a bit wider than in February--and spreads on
small loans (less than $100,000) continued to narrow.
Credit performance at commercial banks was still generally
quite good at the end of the first quarter (chart), although signs
of payment difficulties in consumer loans may have raised some
concern. Charge-off and delinquency rates on business and real
estate loans remained near the low levels reached in early 1995. In
contrast, the delinquency rate on consumer loans remained somewhat
elevated, and the charge-off rate on such loans moved close to its
1991 high. More recently, trade reports have highlighted continued
deterioration in the quality of credit card loan portfolios in the
second quarter and substantial charge-offs or loss provisions at a
few large banks, most notably Bank of New York (BONY). However,
there has been little impact on the card-backed securities market as
such securities have sufficient credit enhancements and market
participants apparently feel that they can distinguish between
"good" and "bad" portfolios. Although bank stock prices dipped
following the BONY announcement on June 20 of a $350 million
increase in its loan-loss reserves, these price declines have since
been reversed.

might be a temporary decline in bond rates (table).2 In recent
weeks, as rates have backed up. issuance by investment-grade firms
has remained firm, while junk-grade offerings have slowed.
Nonetheless, strong demand for high-yield securities, particularly
through mutual funds, continues to entice some issuers into the
market and to compress spreads over Treasuries (chart, lower left
panel).
Commercial paper outstanding at nonfinancial firms changed
little on net over April and May after rising sharply in the first
quarter (chart, lower right panel). The leveling off reflects a
slower pace of merger-related issuance as well as paydowns of some
previously issued paper. Notably, in May, Lockheed-Martin used the
proceeds of a $3.5 billion bond issue--the largest investment-grade
bond offering on record--to pay down about $2.2 billion of
commercial paper and a smaller amount of bank debt that had been
raised to finance its acquisition of Loral.
In addition to narrow spreads of corporate bonds over
Treasuries and low delinquency rates on bank loans, other indicators
of credit quality of nonfinancial firms have remained favorable on
balance. The default rate on junk bonds from year-end 1995 through
May was only 0.6 percent (at an annual rate), considerably below
last year's rate of 2.8 percent. Business failures over the first
five months of this year have been running a little above the 1995
pace, but they remain at the low end of the range observed over the
past decade. Recent news on bond ratings has been mixed: According
to Moody's, the value of long-term debt downgraded in the second
quarter has surpassed that upgraded by about $14 billion, the third
consecutive period of small net downgrades after positive ratings
changes on net for most of 1995. However, a large portion of the
recent downgradings has involved debt of utility firms that appear
vulnerable to competitive pressures as deregulation proceeds.
Moreover, looking ahead, the dollar value of debt placed on review
2. The Greenbook table on gross issuance of securities now
includes bonds offered privately under SEC Rule 144A, which is
designed to facilitate the secondary market trading of private
securities among institutions. The market has come to regard 144A
bonds as nearly perfect substitutes for public issues of
speculative-grade debt. Indeed, most 144A bonds have SEC
registration rights, and firms generally convert the bonds to public
status shortly after issue. The 144A market attracts firms that
need to raise funds more quickly than they can with public issues,
which require SEC registration prior to issue.

for a possible upgrade has risen in the second quarter and exceeds
the amount slated for a downgrade by a sizable margin.
Although most major stock price indexes have fallen on net
since the last FOMC meeting (chart, upper panel), share prices
remain elevated relative to earnings forecasts; indeed, the
twelve-month forward S&P 500 earnings-price ratio stands at about
6.5 percent, near its low over the past decade (chart, middle
panel).
With these market prices, firms have issued large amounts of
stock, lifting gross issuance of equities by nonfinancial firms
above estimated retirements in the second quarter for the first time
in two and a half years. Gross offerings of equity set successive
monthly highs in April and May, and partial data for June suggest
that issuance has remained strong. Initial public offerings (IPOs)
have continued to be extremely well received by the market (chart,
lower panel). An unusually large proportion of IPOs in the second
quarter were offered at prices above the range listed in the firm's
registration filing; the monthly data indicate that this proportion
fell in June from the April-May average but remained relatively
high. Even with the buoyant offering prices, IPO issues so far this
quarter have recorded an average price increase of about 24 percent
on the first day of trading.
Meanwhile, mergers--a significant source of nonfinancial equity
retirements over the past two years--have slowed. No previously
announced megamerger transactions have been completed since the May
FOMC meeting, and the six megamergers that were announced during the
intermeeting period will retire a relatively small amount of equity.
Nonetheless, the underlying conditions that fueled the recent wave
of acquisitions and mergers remain intact: Plentiful financing is
available on favorable terms, and strong economic forces exist to
drive further consolidation, especially in the health care, defense,
and telecommunications industries.
Share repurchases, which accounted for roughly 40 percent of
all nonfinancial equity retired in 1995, have picked up from last
year's strong pace. About $20 billion in share repurchases is
expected to be completed in the second quarter, compared with an
average $15 billion per quarter in 1995. Based on recent repurchase
announcements, the current large volume of buybacks is likely to
continue for some time.

Mutual funds continue to be a key acquirer of corporate shares.
In May, net sales of equity fund shares exceeded $20 billion for the
sixth consecutive month (table). Domestic equity funds have been
capturing the bulk of that inflow, with notable strength in
aggressive growth funds that invest primarily in IPOs and seasoned
small-company shares; in recent months, flows to aggressive growth
funds accounted for nearly 40 percent of the total net sales of
domestic equity funds (chart).
Household Sector Finance
Household borrowing appears to have moderated somewhat in
recent months, mainly reflecting a slowing of consumer credit. In
April, consumer credit expansion dropped to a 7 percent annual rate,
despite another sizable increase in revolving credit (table), and
the relatively slow rise in consumer loans at banks suggests that
the more moderate growth continued in May. Information on mortgage
lending in the current quarter is mixed. Mortgage securitizations
and mortgage applications have remained at relatively high levels,
but real estate loan growth at commercial banks has been running
well below the first-quarter rate. As long-term interest rates have
risen, so has the spread of fixed-rate over adjustable-rate mortgage
rates (chart, middle panel). The share of conventional home
purchase mortgages closed with adjustable rates increased to
31 percent in May, up from 23 percent in April (chart, middle
panel).
Delinquency rates on household debt in the first quarter
suggest that repayment problems worsened a bit, although increases
on most household debt categories have been moderate and
delinquencies remain well below historical peaks. For example, the
American Bankers Association's series for closed-end loans has
retraced only a third of its decline from the 1991:Q3 high (chart,
upper panel), and bank Call Report data show a similar pattern.
Credit card delinquencies tell a less reassuring story. The
ABA series for credit card delinquencies reached a new high in the
first quarter (chart, middle panel). Other measures of credit card
delinquency--from the Call Report and from Moody's--have posted
increases that are less sharp but still significant. Hard evidence
is lacking, but industry observers believe that many card issuers
achieved rapid growth of their credit card receivables in the 1990s
by greatly relaxing their lending standards, and as noted above,
trade reports have pointed to large increases in loss provisions at

some banks in the second quarter. It appears that banks have
initiated some steps in recent months to tighten their credit card
lending practices, as evident in the May Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey.
Delinquency rates for auto loans at captive finance companies
are on historically high ground (chart, lower panel). According to
one finance company credit manager, the rise in delinquencies was,
in part, an expected result of an effort to sell cars by
liberalizing lending standards. Indeed, in his view, delinquencies
have risen less than the company had anticipated. The level of the
delinquency rate at captive finance companies has also been boosted
a bit by the shift away from loans toward leasing; leases are not
included in the loan delinquency data, and lease customers tend to
be better credit risks than the average borrower.
Delinquency rates for mortgages remained on the low side of
historical experience. According to Mortgage Bankers Association
data, both the delinquency rate for loans thirty days or more past
due and for loans sixty days or more past due, a measure of more
serious payment problems, edged down (chart, upper panel). Call
Report data indicate little change in delinquency rates for home
mortgages in total at banks, with the delinquency rate on revolving
home equity loans only edged up and delinquency rates on other home
mortgage loans unchanged.
With delinquency rates low, mortgage lenders have apparently
kept loan terms favorable. Data from the Federal Housing Finance
Board's monthly survey of rates and terms on conventional home
mortgages indicate that the average loan-to-value ratio at major
lenders edged up in April for the third consecutive month to
79.7 percent, the highest level since August 1995 (chart, middle
panel).
Finally, another broad measure of household financial
distress--the personal bankruptcy rate--has reached a new high
(chart, lower panel). While the increase in bankruptcies no doubt
reflects the rise in debt payment problems, the dollar amount of
assets that can be exempted from liquidation was increased early
last year, making bankruptcy a more attractive alternative for
troubled debtors. A previous liberalization of bankruptcy law
contributed to a threefold surge in filings in the mid- to late-
1980s, but not to a commensurate rise in loan losses.

Treasury and Agency Financing
The staff projects a second-quarter federal budget surplus of
$50 billion (not seasonally adjusted). Together with $13 billion to
be raised from coupon issues, this surplus will be used to replenish
the Treasury's cash balance and to pay down roughly $42 billion in
bills (table).
The Treasury recently increased by $500 million the sizes of
its two-, three-, and five-year note auctions. The Treasury appears
more willing than previously to vary the size of bill auctions to
manage its cash balance. Between May 30 and June 20, bill auction
sizes increased from $28 billion to $31 billion, and then fell back
to $27 billion.
Following the May announcement that it planned to issue
inflation-indexed bonds, the Treasury initiated meetings with
dealers and investors and a thirty-day public comment period to
develop the precise characteristics of the securities. Decisions on
the design of these instruments are expected after the feedback has
been evaluated. The Secretary of the Treasury has said that he
expects to be issuing such securities in late 1996 or early 1997.
Agency issuance in the primary market has slowed slightly in
the second quarter. Spreads between yields on agency debt and
Treasuries of comparable maturities have remained steady in the
primary market and have widened slightly in the secondary market.
The use of foreign markets to fund agency activities continues to
expand. In June, Fannie Mae became the first agency to announce
that it will issue a yen-denominated security. Since its first
foreign issue in June 1994, Fannie has raised nearly $10-1/4 billion
in the global bond market, denominated in dollars and deutschemarks.
Municipal Bonds
Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt picked up in May
from April's pace, reflecting stronger refunding volume when rates
fell temporarily in the latter part of the month (table).
Preliminary data for June suggest that issuance has edged off with
the backup in rates. Owing to a heavy volume of scheduled bond
redemptions in June and July, retirements almost certainly will
outpace gross issuance over these two months, keeping outstanding
municipal debt on a downward track.
Yields on long-term municipal bonds rose less than those on
Treasuries over the intermeeting period, and the long-term tax-
exempt to taxable ratio dropped to its lowest level in more than a

year (chart). The yield ratio jumped in mid-1995 and remained
elevated at year-end, owing largely to investors' concerns that tax
reform would reduce the advantages of municipal debt. As market
concerns about tax reform diminished, municipals outperformed
comparable Treasuries, reversing a good part of the earlier run-up
in the yield ratio.
In explaining movements in the yield ratio over the past year,
two other factors are often cited--the shrinking supply of municipal
debt and developments in Orange County. However, these factors
probably have not been responsible for the rise and the subsequent
decline in the yield ratio over the past year. The amount of
outstanding municipal debt has been moving lower since 1994, without
appreciable variation in the trend. News about Orange County has
not had substantial effects on national indexes of municipal
security prices, either early when the County's massive investment
losses were revealed or more recently when the county emerged from
bankruptcy.3
3. However, yield spreads for California debt widened somewhat in
the wake of Orange County's bankruptcy.

In April, the level of exports rose 2-1/2 percent relative to
the first-quarter level. Increases were recorded in most trade
categories, but exports of computers, semiconductors, and automotive
products remained weak. The level of imports increased almost
3 percent relative to the first quarter. Almost all of the increase
was due to higher imports of oil and gold.
Oil Imports
The quantity of oil imported in the first quarter of 1996
increased moderately relative to the fourth quarter, as a strong
increase in oil consumption was partially offset by a larger-than-
normal seasonal inventory drawdown. April imports were well above
first-quarter rates due to an increase in oil inventories. Pre-
liminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports
continued at a brisk pace in May due to a renewed pick-up in
consumption and continued rebuilding of oil stocks.
The price of imported oil increased sharply in the first
quarter and, again, in April. Unusually cold weather in North
America and Japan and weather-related production disruptions in the
North Sea and Australia helped drive up oil prices in the first few
months of the year. Spot WTI declined more than $2.25 per barrel in

May, averaging $21.26 per barrel. Prices have fallen a bit more
in June and have been trading in the $20 per barrel range. The
decline in oil prices since April reflects an unwinding of earlier,
temporary shocks to the oil market. The announcement of Iraq's
agreement with the United Nations to export a limited quantity of
oil (estimated to be 800,000 b/d) under U.N. supervision has had
little effect on either spot or futures prices.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of non-oil imports decreased during April-May combined,
at about the same rate as in the two previous quarters. The prices
of imported capital goods and industrial supplies continued to fall
sharply. These decreases were only partly offset by substantial
price increases in a broad array of imported foods (coffee, grains,
and vegetables).
Prices of exports increased rapidly in April-May combined,
significantly faster than in recent quarters. The pickup is due
entirely to a more rapid increase in agricultural prices (especially
grains). On balance, prices of non-agricultural exports fell,
with continued declines in prices of capital goods and industrial
supplies.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit increased $20.6 billion
(SAAR), to $142.4 billion SAAR, in the first quarter of 1996. The
increase in the deficit on trade in goods and services and larger
net unilateral transfers more than offset a decrease in net
investment income payments. The narrower deficit on investment
income owed mostly to larger receipts on U.S. direct investment
abroad, while net unilateral transfers were substantially higher
partly reflecting U.S. government grant disbursements delayed from
the fourth quarter because of the government shutdown.
As is customary each June, estimates of U.S. international
transactions are revised to incorporate updated source data and
improved methodologies. These revisions increased the current
account deficit $1 to $2 billion in the years 1986 through 1992
and lowered the deficit $3 to $5 billion in 1994 and 1995.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official inflows to the United States slowed markedly
in April from the heady pace of the first quarter. (See line 1 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) Most of the
slowing owes to reduced inflows from Japan, which were boosted in
the first quarter by large foreign exchange market intervention.
Official inflows from non-G-10 countries picked up from their low
level in March to resume the robust pace of the first quarter.
Partial data for May from FRBNY indicate official inflows of almost
$10 billion, primarily by G-10 and OPEC countries. For the first
three weeks of June. FRBNY reports a modest outflow attributable to
a reduction in Brazil's holdings.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities continued
strong in April (line 4). maintaining a pace roughly equal to last
year's record. Relative to the first quarter, April's purchases
showed a shift toward Treasuries away from corporate and other
bonds, reflecting a shift away from federal agency bonds. Private
purchases of such bonds fell from more than $14 billion in the first
quarter to zero in April.

U.S. purchases of foreign securities slowed considerably in
April. Equity purchases throughout Asia slowed, while bond sales
in Europe and Canada offset a pickup in purchases of Asian bonds.
Banks and securities dealers reported significant inflows in April,
reversing about half of the large outflow in March (line 3). Most
of April's inflow is attributable to a reduction in non-bank
security dealer's liabilities to foreigners. As shown on line 1
of the International Banking Table, U.S. banks increased their net
claims on related foreign offices in April.
Direct investment capital inflows surged to almost $30 billion
in the first quarter, reflecting a pickup in foreign acquisitions of
U.S. firms (line 7 of the Summary Table). In contrast, U.S. direct
investment abroad slowed somewhat between the fourth and first
quarters, but remained near the pace for all of last year. For the
first quarter as a whole, recorded capital inflows exceeded the sum
of recorded capital outflows and the current account, leaving a
statistical discrepancy of $-7.5 billion.
Foreign Exchange Markets
The weighted-average foreign exchange value of the dollar in
terms of the other G-10 currencies has declined less than 1 percent
since the May 21 FOMC meeting. Over this period, the dollar has
depreciated about 1 percent against the mark and most other European
currencies, while firming over 2 percent relative to the yen.
The mark's relative strength appears to have reflected mainly
a growing sentiment among market participants that the time may
have passed for an easing of German monetary policy, and that the
next interest rate move by the Bundesbank may well be an increase
rather than a decrease. This view has gained credence over the past
month as the Bundesbank has kept the repo rate unchanged at the
3.30 percent level maintained since early February, and as incoming
data have begun to show some tentative signs of strengthening
economic activity in Germany. The continuation of M3 growth well
above target--with annualized growth from the fourth-quarter base
period easing only to 10.5 percent in May--also was interpreted as
lessening the likelihood of any further Bundesbank easing.
In contrast, the relative weakness of the yen recently seems
to have been influenced by an apparent reduction of market expecta-
tions that the Bank of Japan would move to raise short-term interest

rates in the near term. Over the past month, a number of Japanese
officials have made statements suggesting that Japanese monetary
policy would need to remain accommodative to ensure that the
fledgling economic recovery in Japan becomes self-sustaining. The
apparent market confidence that there will be no near-term Japanese
monetary tightening appears not to have been significantly affected
by the announcement on June 18 of very strong real GDP growth in the
first quarter.
Short-term interest rates in the major foreign industrial
countries have on average been little changed since the May FOMC
meeting. The short-term rate in the United Kingdom has declined
35 basis points, reflecting the Bank of England's 1/4 percentage
point reduction in its minimum lending rate to 5-3/4 percent
announced on June 6. Chancellor of the Exchequer Clarke cited
easing cost pressures in the United Kingdom and below-trend growth
in support of the move, although some market commentators believed
the cut had more of a political motivation. The Bank of France also
announced an interest rate reduction on June 6. The Bank's inter-
vention rate--which serves as a lower bound to money market rates in
France--was reduced 10 basis points to 3.6 percent. On June 19, the
Swedish central bank lowered its official deposit and lending rates
by 75 basis points to 5.25 percent and 6.75 percent respectively.
Long-term interest rates in almost all of the G-10 countries
have moved higher over the past month, as incoming data have tended
on balance to suggest strengthening economic activity in both the
United States and many of the major foreign industrial countries.
In Germany, the 10-year bellwether bond rate has risen 20 basis
points since the May FOMC meeting, 5 basis points less than the
rise in the comparable U.S. long-term rate over this period. In
contrast, the Japanese long-term rate has recorded almost no net
change over the past month.
Since the May FOMC meeting, the Mexican peso has depreciated
over 2 percent against the dollar, seemingly influenced mainly by
concerns over the impact of higher current and prospective U.S.
interest rates, rather than any adverse new information on the
Mexican economy. On June 18, the Mexican Finance Ministry announced
that it planned to raise a $3 billion five-year loan from a
syndicate of commercial banks, and would use the proceeds of this

IV-12
loan, along with an additional $1.7 billion recently raised in
international capital markets, to repay $4.7 billion of Mexico's
outstanding debt to the U.S. Treasury.
The Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market over
the intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries in
the first quarter ranged from surprisingly robust to fairly weak.
The Japanese economy expanded at a remarkable pace; combined with
recent indicators of activity, this suggests that recovery has taken
hold. In contrast, the German economy contracted further in the
first quarter, but more recent indicators suggest that a rebound
might be underway. First-quarter growth in Italy and France was
boosted by special factors, while recent data indicate that economic
activity is weak. The United Kingdom and Canada extended modest
rates of expansion.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. Recent consumer-price
inflation has averaged about 1-1/2 percent in Germany and Canada,
and under 3 percent in the United Kingdom and France. Italian
inflation, while higher than in the other foreign G-7 countries, has
slowed considerably since January. In Japan, prices have risen
slightly, reflecting depreciation of the yen, after falling for more
than a year.
Individual country notes. The preliminary estimate of first-
quarter GDP in Japan showed the highest growth rate -- 12.7 percent
(SAAR) -- of any quarter since 1973. In addition, fourth-quarter
growth last year was revised up. All components of final domestic
demand grew strongly in the first quarter, while inventories
increased slightly and net exports declined. Four consecutive
quarters of significant growth at increasing rates have raised the
estimated level of GDP in the first quarter to 5.5 percent above its
year-earlier level. The first-quarter figure was much higher than
expected in light of other indicators of first-quarter activity even
after accounting for a leap-year effect. This raises the likelihood
of a downward revision when data on preliminary second-quarter GDP
are released in mid-September.

Nonetheless, available indicators for the second quarter,
including industrial production, machinery orders, and housing
starts, point to continued growth in underlying activity. The Bank
of Japan's May survey (Tankan) registered a modest increase in the
diffusion index of business sentiment at major manufacturers from
its February level. The index for smaller manufacturers also
increased modestly in the May survey. However, after declining in
March, the unemployment rate returned to its postwar high in April.

Wholesale and consumer prices have risen slightly in recent
months. The increases stem from the effect of yen depreciation on
import prices as prices of domestically produced goods have
continued to decline.
The May merchandise trade surplus was $4.9 billion (SA)
compared with $2.5 billion in April. The April current account
surplus was only $3.4 billion (SA) compared with $5.7 billion in
March.
German real GDP contracted 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate
(adjusted for seasonal and calendar variation) during the first
quarter. This followed a decline of more than 1/2 percent (annual
rate, revised) in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first
quarter, domestic demand rose somewhat, despite a precipitous drop
in construction (which fell almost 28 percent at an annual rate) due
in large part to the very cold weather, while other elements of
domestic spending increased. Exports declined while imports
remained unchanged. The composition of GDP growth in the first
quarter contrasts with that in the fourth quarter, when a signifi-
cant decline in domestic demand (due largely to a drawdown in
inventories) was offset by a strong external sector.

Growth appears to have bounced back in the second quarter,
perhaps quite significantly, largely due to a pick-up in
construction activity. Stronger construction output helped
industrial production in April rise 1.7 percent to stand 1.3 percent
above the first-quarter average. April orders, particularly from
domestic firms, picked up strongly as well. The IFO business

conditions, showed some improvement in April and May from a very low
level in March. Price pressures remain modest, with producer prices
down on a 12-month basis. Data released on June 26 show that the
12-month change in the CPI slowed to 1.2 percent in June.
The mediators in the public sector pay dispute reached an
agreement that would increase wages of public sector workers about
1/2 to 3/4 percent in 1996 and 1997. As part of a package of fiscal
measures announced in late April, the government had sought to hold
public sector wages unchanged and reduce the payments for sick
leave. The issue of sick pay was not addressed in the new wage
agreement.

However, underlying economic activity is estimated to have been
considerably weaker than this GDP figure would suggest. Over half
of the rise in GDP last quarter can be attributed to a rebound from
the strikes last November and December and to a leap-year effect.
Total domestic demand turned around owing to a sharp rise in private
consumption (due to higher energy consumption and a catch-up after
the strikes), but investment remained soft and inventories continued
to be a drag on growth. Surprisingly strong export growth under-
pinned a positive contribution from net exports.

Monthly indicators for the second quarter suggest that
underlying economic activity has remained weak. Industrial
production in April fell, suggesting that the first-quarter rise
reflected a strike rebound. Business surveys by INSEE throughout
the second quarter point to weak output, above normal inventories,
and a deterioration in business confidence. Real consumption of
manufactured products fell in May for the fourth straight month
putting the April-May average below the first-quarter average (which
reflects the sharp rise in January associated with a strike-rebound
effect). Consumer confidence in May fell to the low registered last
December. Annual revisions to the unemployment data reveal a
sharper rise in the unemployment rate since last year. A slight

IV-17
acceleration in consumer prices this year continues to reflect
higher food and energy prices and the increase in the VAT last
August.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP rose 1.6 percent (SAAR) in the
first quarter, slightly below the pace seen during the previous
several quarters. Stronger total domestic demand underpinned first-
quarter growth. While investment slowed somewhat from its sharp
rise in the fourth quarter of 1995, robust consumption growth
boosted total domestic demand.

Available second-quarter data for the consumer and manu-
facturing sectors are mixed. According to the Halifax house-price
index, house prices rose in May for the tenth consecutive month
helped by falling mortgage interest rates. Consumer credit rose
sharply in April. However, retail sales declined in May due to
unseasonably cold weather. April industrial output fell from its
upwardly revised March level, and the May purchasing managers' index
showed a further decline in both output and orders.

Targeted inflation, measured as the change from a year earlier
in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, has been
little changed (at about 2.9 percent) for the past year. Headline
inflation fell to 2.2 percent in May from the first-quarter average
of 2.8 percent due to declining housing costs. A large fall in oil
prices lowered May producer input prices noticeably.
In Italy, the advance GDP release stated that real economic
activity rose 0.8 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, owing in part
to a leap-year effect. [No further details will be available until
final first-quarter GDP is released on July 5.] GDP had declined
3.6 percent (SAAR) in the fourth quarter largely due to a sharp drop
in exports and reduced government expenditure. The slowdown in real
economic activity that began in the fourth quarter of last year
appears to have continued into the second quarter. Industrial
production in April fell sharply. At the same time, while picking
up from the fourth-quarter low, business sentiment remained
significantly below levels registered in mid-1995.

IV-19
On balance, news on Italian inflation continues to be
encouraging. The 12-month CPI inflation rate, which had declined in
three successive months before plateauing in April, slowed further
through June (preliminary) reflecting the slowing of the economy as
well as lira appreciation. Although the wholesale price index
ticked up slightly in April, 12-month rates of increase in wholesale
prices and wages continued to recede.

After being sworn in on May 18, the Prodi government gained
full powers on May 31 upon winning the second of two confidence
votes in parliament. Prodi's cabinet includes former technocrats as
well as nine members of the PDS, the largest party in the center-
left bloc. Former prime minister and previous Bank of Italy
governor Ciampi is in charge of a portfolio that combines the
treasury and budget ministries. Prodi's predecessor Dini has joined
the new cabinet as foreign minister.
On June 19, the government approved a $10.5 billion supple-
mentary budget for 1996. The supplementary budget, which is
designed to enable the government to maintain its deficit target for
this year, aims to raise about $3 billion from increased revenues
and $7.5 billion from planned spending cuts.
Economic activity in Canada expanded 1.2 percent (SAAR) in the
first quarter of 1996, following growth of 0.9 percent in the fourth

IV-20
quarter of last year. Total domestic demand expanded at a robust
pace, but was partially offset by a decrease in the contribution
from net exports. Both exports and imports were affected by the
General Motors strike in March, while a decline in exports of crude
materials contributed further to the drop in total exports.

Data for the second quarter are limited. Retail sales in
April were flat for the third consecutive month. Although
employment declined slightly in May, the April-May average
remained 0.3 percent above the first-quarter average. The
unemployment rate has been slow to improve, however, as job growth
has led to increased labor-force participation. Housing starts
rebounded in May, bringing the April-May average to 5.5 percent
above the first-quarter average.
Consumer-price inflation remains subdued, despite recent
increases in gasoline prices that have contributed to higher monthly
consumer-price inflation since March. In May, the 12-month change
in consumer prices was 1.5 percent, still in the lower half of the
Bank of Canada's target band of 1 to 3 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In recent months, real GDP in Mexico and Argentina has
rebounded from lows experienced during 1995, but measures of
economic activity in Brazil are mixed. Economic growth in major
Asian developing economies appears to have moderated to more
sustainable rates, while Russian real GDP has continued to contract.
During May, monthly inflation declined in Mexico but increased
sharply in Venezuela and slightly in Brazil. Twelve-month inflation
in Argentina, as well as the major Asian economies, has been fairly
stable and well below 10 percent. In recent months, Mexico has
continued to register trade surpluses, and Argentina's trade surplus
has widened. China experienced a small trade deficit during the
first five months of 1996, while Taiwan's trade surplus in May was
the largest in almost a decade.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, real GDP in the first
quarter of 1996 was only 1 percent below its year-earlier level,
compared with a year-over-year 5.8 percent decline in the fourth
quarter of 1995 and a year-over-year 8.1 percent decline in the
third quarter. The comparatively strong performance during the
first quarter of 1996 partially reflects the fact that economic
activity was already depressed during the first quarter of 1995.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, GDP is estimated to have increased
about 2 percent (not at an annual rate) in the first quarter after
rising 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995. Rapid growth in the
first quarter of this year, as in the fourth quarter of 1995, was
largely due to a recovery of domestic demand. By contrast, net
export growth, which moderated the decline in GDP during the first
two quarters of 1995, has weakened somewhat in the most recent three
quarters.
Movements in monthly indicators suggest continued recovery in
the second quarter. The urban unemployment rate (n.s.a.) declined
from an average of 6.2 percent in the first quarter to 5.4 percent
in May. Imports grew substantially in April and May, also pointing
toward a recovery of demand. Because export growth also has been
substantial, however, Mexico has continued to register trade
surpluses.
Consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.8 percent in April, as
a result of scheduled increases in the minimum wage and public

IV-25
sector prices, but declined to 1.8 percent in May. Inflation during
the first half of June was just below 0.9 percent, suggesting that
inflationary pressures remain subdued.

In Brazil, real GDP fell in the first quarter of 1996 from its
level a year earlier (partially reflecting strong performance during
the first quarter of 1995), but was above its level in the other
three quarters of 1995. Industrial production in April was
higher than in March but was down 2.5 percent from a year earlier.
Inflation picked up recently due to seasonal factors, but remains
low by Brazilian standards. In mid-June, the Central Bank adjusted
the limits of the exchange rate band from 0.999-1.004 reals per
dollar to 1.002-1.007 reals per dollar. International reserves
at end-May 1996 totalled $59 billion (liquidity concept), up
considerably from $34 billion a year ago, and the trade surplus
increased slightly in May.

In a move designed to stimulate growth and boost exports, the
Brazilian government announced two measures on June 20. The first
is a $500 million package of credit for small companies that will be
administered by the National Development Bank. The second is a
$1 billion credit line to exporters over the next 12 months.
Brazil's lower house of Congress voted on a series of amend-
ments to the government's pension reform bill. The government,
however, failed to defeat an opposition amendment that maintains
special conditions for pension funds of state-owned firms.
Brazil's privatization program is progressing, despite the
announced resignation of privatization director Elena Landau. A
Brazilian senate panel has approved a bill that would allow the
government to privatize state mining giant Vale do Rio Doce without
upper house approval. The bill must now be approved by the full
senate.
In Argentina, real GDP contracted by 3.2 percent in the first
quarter of 1996 from a year earlier. However, compared with the
fourth quarter of 1995, real GDP grew by about 3 percent (AR),
suggesting that a recovery is now taking hold. Inflation remained
subdued, with consumer prices declining by 0.3 percent in May com-
pared with a year earlier. International reserves less gold totaled
$14 billion at end-May, compared with $14.3 billion at the end of
both 1994 and 1995. The trade surplus in April continued to expand.
A $754 million budget deficit in May has renewed fears that
Argentina may not satisfy the fiscal targets in its IMF program,
which calls for a 1996 fiscal deficit (excluding privatization
revenue) of $2.5 billion. Many analysts believe that the 1996
deficit could be as high as $5 billion, forcing Argentina to
renegotiate its IMF program. In an effort to reduce expenditures,
President Menem signed a decree on June 25 to streamline the
government by cutting the number of departments by a third.

In Venezuela, monthly consumer price inflation surged during
May, due to the liberalization of exchange controls and the depre-
ciation of the bolivar. Following the announcement of the new
macroeconomic stabilization program in April, Venezuela reached
preliminary agreement with the IMF for a $1.4 billion equivalent
12-month stand-by arrangement. In recent weeks, Venezuela has
approved two measures, which should help facilitate the IMF program.
First, on June 19. the Venezuelan Congress approved an increase in
the wholesale tax rate, a major step toward reducing the fiscal
deficit. Second, the government recently allocated an extra
$152 million to meet foreign debt payments, mostly to Paris Club
creditors. (Venezuela, however, remains over $400 million in
arrears on its foreign debt payments.) The IMF Executive Board is
expected to consider the program for Venezuela on July 12.

In China, inflation has remained relatively steady in recent
months. China ran small trade surpluses in April and May. Over the
first five months of the year, however, China's trade deficit
registered $0.5 billion, compared with a surplus of $10 billion in
the year-earlier period. The value of exports in the first five
months fell 7 percent from a year earlier, while the value of
imports rose 15 percent. The decline in exports appears to reflect
a cut in China's export tax rebate. Foreign exchange reserves
reached $85 billion at the end of May, up $11 billion from the end
of 1995.

In mid-June, China announced plans to make its currency
convertible for current account transactions by the end of 1996.
While the currency is already convertible for most trade-related
purposes, the new measures will relax restrictions on transactions
for services and the repatriation of profits.
In Taiwan, real GDP in the first quarter was up 5.3 percent
from a year earlier. Industrial production, however, has been
relatively flat in 1996. Taiwan's monthly trade surplus of $1.9
billion in May was its highest level in nine years, primarily
reflecting an 18 percent fall in imports from their year-earlier
level. Taiwan's trade surplus reached $5.3 billion during the first
five months of 1996, compared with a $2.3 billion surplus a year
earlier. The value of exports was up 5 percent, while the value of
imports was down 2 percent.
In early June, Morgan Stanley announced that it would include
Taiwanese stocks in its emerging market equity index. The move has
contributed to a surge in Taiwan's stock exchange in recent months.

In Korea, economic growth appears to have slowed to a more
sustainable rate since the second half of 1995. Despite a high
level of capacity utilization, inflation has remained low by
historical standards. Import growth has weakened considerably since
the middle of last year, in part because of a dramatic deceleration
in imports of capital goods. However, falling export prices and
weak demand for Korea's exports from industrial countries led to a
noticeable widening of Korea's current account deficit from its
year-earlier level during the first four months of the year.
Korea recently announced several financial liberalization
measures intended to strengthen its bid to become a member of the
OECD. These measures include allowing foreign banks to operate
wholly owned subsidiaries in Korea by the end of 1998 and further
relaxing the limit on foreign ownership of Korean equity. It is
unclear whether these moves will be sufficient to satisfy
requirements for OECD membership.

In Russia's June 16 Presidential election, Boris Yeltsin
finished in first place, capturing 35 percent of the vote.
Communist Gennady Zyuganov was second with 32 percent. Since no
candidate won a majority, Yeltsin and Zyuganov will compete in a
July 3 run-off. In an effort to solidify his position, Yeltsin
appointed third-place finisher Alexander Lebed as Secretary of
the government's Security Council and National Security Advisor.
Yeltsin's strength in the first-round election and his rapprochement
with Lebed did much to calm anxiety about the political situation in
Russia's financial markets.
Russian real GDP during the first five months of 1996 declined
by 3 percent from its year-earlier level, and industrial production
fell by 4 percent. Russian officials have linked the decline in
economic activity during the first half to "under investment." due
to political uncertainty in the run-up to the election. Monthly
inflation during May remained at 2 percent. The ruble depreciated
at a monthly rate of 1.5 percent during May and the first three
weeks of June.
Russia has completed one quarterly review and two monthly
reviews under its IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF). A severe
shortfall in fiscal revenues, however, threatens the viability of
the program; revenues during the first quarter were only 89 percent
of levels anticipated in the EFF. During April, net international
reserves declined from $8.7 billion to $6.7 billion, but remained
above the program's $4.8 billion floor.
