The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The limited data now available for the third quarter suggest
some slackening in the pace of economic expansion since the spring,
but just how much is far from clear. Although private domestic
final demand appears to be decelerating, lean inventory positions at
midyear may be prompting some restocking. Employment continues to
expand at a pace sufficient to maintain the tautness in the labor
market that produced a pickup in wage gains in the first half of the
year. However, major price measures have shown no signs of
underlying acceleration.
GDP in the Second Quarter
According to BEA's advance estimate, real GDP grew 4.2 percent
at an annual rate in the second quarter of 1996. As shown in the
table, we anticipate a downward revision to this figure, to about
3.7 percent. In particular, June inventory investment came in below
BEA's expectations. For final sales, revised estimates of June
retail sales will likely pare the advance estimate of PCE. Although
no new source data have become available, the second-quarter
estimate of federal purchases looks oddly high and seems likely to
be revised down. New information on construction put in place and
capital goods shipments lead us to expect an upward revision to
second-quarter business fixed investment. In addition, after
reviewing the other available second-quarter information, we think
that BEA's assumptions for imports in June may have been too skimpy.

Labor Market Developments
Labor market indicators have been mixed of late. Private
nonfarm payroll employment rose 156,000 in July, a pace considerably
slower than the average monthly increase of 219,000 for the first
half of the year. And, with a 0.4 hour decline in average weekly
hours, production-worker hours dropped back sharply to a level equal
to the second-quarter average.
In the household survey, however, total employment increased
274,000 last month--maintaining the rapid pace of the first half.
The labor force participation rate rose 0.2 percentage point in
July, again reaching 66.9 percent--its high point for the year.
Since bottoming out at 66.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995,
the participation rate has returned to levels more consistent with
our estimate of its trend. The rebound in participation has been
widespread across demographic groups; only the rate for teenagers
has shown a decline since the end of 1995.
The published unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent in
July, from 5.3 percent in June; however, on a concurrently
seasonally adjusted basis, the rate was 5.4 percent in both months.
Other recent indicators also suggest continued labor market
strength. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have averaged
331,000 per week since the beginning of July--the lowest level for
any six-week period since early 1995.1 The adjusted Help Wanted
Index rose appreciably in June, to the high end of the range that
has prevailed for the past two years. Consumers' appraisals of job
availability improved considerably in July in the Conference Board's
survey of consumer attitudes. The July Michigan survey of consumers
similarly showed an improvement in expectations for unemployment
over the next twelve months.
According to the BLS, output per hour in the nonfarm business
sector edged down at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the second
quarter--a figure the staff expects to be revised down to a
1. Claims were volatile in July and early August, rising to
370,000 during the week ended July 6 and then falling sharply to
294,000 during the week ended July 27, before rebounding somewhat in
the first two weeks of August. This volatile pattern--seen each
July for the past three years--reflects the inability of seasonal
factors to account for annual variation in the timing of summer
layoffs in the automobile and textile industries. In addition,
unusually small layoffs at GM this year--as the automaker attempted
to rebuild its inventories--contributed to the especially low
July 27 claims figure.

0.6 percent decline. Nonfarm output now is estimated to have risen
3.7 percent at an annual rate (1/2 percentage point below the
published BLS number), while hours worked jumped 4.2 percent (annual
rate). Over the four quarters ended in the second quarter, labor
productivity rose 0.5 percent--a bit less than in the year-earlier
period.
Industrial Production
Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in July, following
three consecutive months of strong growth.2 Manufacturing output
posted a 0.3 percent gain that was mostly offset by declines in
utilities and in mining; electricity generation dropped sharply for
a second month, as a result of unseasonably cool weather, and coal
production fell. Roughly two-thirds of the gain in manufacturing
production was the direct result of a strong advance in the output
of motor vehicles and parts. The remainder of the increase occurred
in the output of information-related products and the production of
aircraft and parts. The growth in these areas of manufacturing
was tempered by lackluster production of non-auto consumer durables
and industrial equipment.
Production of motor vehicles in July--13.4 million vehicles at
an annual rate--came in well above both the announced schedules in
place at the beginning of the month and the strong pace in June.
With the pickup in production, the days' supply of cars moved back
to more comfortable levels. In contrast, the days' supply of light
trucks was at the upper end of the range that has prevailed since
early 1995. Some of the surge in production may reflect
precautionary stockbuilding against the possibility of a strike by
2. The July estimate of manufacturing activity shows an
increase despite the considerable drop in manufacturing hours
reported in the BLS payroll survey. Several factors account for
this divergence: First, physical product data for paper,
paperboard, and motor vehicles were strong compared with the
corresponding hours data. Second, some of the decreases in hours
occurred in industries that have lower value-added weights in IP
than employment shares. Third, a few industries showed sharp
decreases in hours because of unusually timed vacation periods
during the payroll survey reference week that should have a smaller
effect on output for the month as a whole. Finally, we were
cautious in reading the July decline in hours for the computer and
office equipment industry too literally because weakness in these
hours through June did not turn out to be consistent with other
input indicators.
3. The continuing strike at a McDonnell Douglas plant, which
started on June 5 and involves about 6,700 workers, had a negligible
effect on manufacturing output.

Outside of the motor vehicle and parts industry, manufacturing
output ticked up 0.1 percent last month, after two months of strong
gains. The deceleration stems in large part from an estimated
flattening in production of construction supplies and a decline in
output of non-auto consumer durables. Production of consumer
nondurables, which has not expanded, on balance, in more than a
year, was unchanged again in July. Output of business equipment,
excluding motor vehicles and office and computing, also fell as
production of industrial equipment registered its fifth monthly
decline. Production in the materials industries was boosted by the
output of motor vehicle parts and semiconductors. Outside of
equipment parts, the production of durable goods materials fell
while production of nondurable materials inched up after solid gains
earlier in the year.
Although the manufacturing utilization rate is estimated to
have eased back to 82.3 percent in July, it still stands about 1
percentage point above its 1967-95 average, boosted by sustained
high readings for computer equipment, primary metals, and petroleum
products. In primary processing industries, the average operating
4. Recent reports have suggested that while General Motors could
be the strike target, Chrysler will more likely be hit. The
official date for announcing the target is August 22. At this
point, if a strike were to occur, it would probably be at the local
and not the national level. Even so, the effects on overall output
could be significant if the stoppage occurs at a key parts plant. A
strike in Canada still remains more likely than a domestic strike.
General Motors is the overwhelming favorite in Canada as the target,
and if a strike shutting down parts production were to occur there,
U.S. output would be crippled as well.

rate dropped to 86.2 percent in July, above its long-term average
but below the high levels seen in early 1995.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending evidently has weakened somewhat on average in
the past couple of months after expanding briskly in the spring.
Nonetheless, the fundamentals suggest that this should be no more
than a temporary pause; The underlying trend in income appears
solid, and recent readings on consumer sentiment have been very
positive.
Sales of new light vehicles, adjusted for changes in reporting
periods, dropped in July from the 15.1 million unit pace in
June.5 Most of the weakness owed to a cutback in fleet sales by
General Motors--by 0.5 million units, primarily in autos--while GM's
retail sales were about unchanged (confidential).6 Consumer
demand for light vehicles remained at a high level in July, and
consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for new vehicles remained
positive, encouraged by a continuation of sizable sales incentives.
Total nominal retail sales moved up 0.1 percent in July,
despite a steep decline in spending at automotive dealers.7
Nominal outlays in the retail control category, which excludes sales
at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose
0.5 percent. Within the retail control category in July, gains in
outlays at food, drug, and "other durable goods" stores more than
offset weak spending elsewhere. Many industry analysts have
attributed the July weakness in some of the more discretionary
categories of retail sales (such as apparel and furniture) to two
special factors. First, the Olympics may have kept potential
5. The major Japanese firms counted sales during the first couple
of days of July as June sales. We estimate that this shift reduced
sales in July by about 0.2 million units. Sales in June were not
distorted, however, because the May reporting period was extended
into early June. Thus, the dip in July sales was an offset to the
upward boost to May sales. The major Japanese firms intend to
continue shifting their reporting periods as they see fit as long as
the reporting period for Ford is different from that of GM and
Chrysler.
6. General Motors may have deliberately curbed fleet sales in
July to ensure that consumers were not inhibited by limited
supplies. At the beginning of July, inventories of General Motors'
autos were particularly lean, and with most assembly plants closed
during the first two weeks of July, the prospects of limited stocks
restricting overall sales likely increased. This situation also
likely played some role in the firm's decision to step up production
well beyond initial plans for the second half of the month.
7. Sales of fleet vehicles typically occur through the dealer
network and thus are captured in the retail sales data.

shoppers at home in front of the television. Second, the cooler
weather may have reduced the appeal of air-conditioned malls and
depressed sales of air conditioners and other summer merchandise.
Be that as it may, the net gain in retail control in July merely
offset a like decline in June. Consequently, it appears that in
July real consumer spending on goods, excluding motor vehicles, was
about 2-1/4 percent above its second-quarter average, at an annual
rate.
Real expenditures on services fell 0.3 percent in June.
Spending on energy services posted a particularly large decline, as
temperatures returned to normal after unseasonably warm weather in
May. Elsewhere, estimated declines in spending on transportation,
medical care, and personal business services about offset increases
in outlays for other types of services. For July, the indicators
thus far are mixed: Although relatively cool temperatures likely
led to a further decline in energy spending, the Olympics probably
provided a significant boost to spending on recreation services.

Total pre-tax household income grew rapidly in the second
quarter, boosted in part by a spurt in private wages and salaries in
June. However, real disposable income increased at only a
1-1/2 percent annual rate during the quarter, and with robust
8. BEA has in the past made a judgmental adjustment to the
"spectator sports" subcategory of recreation services to capture
increases in spending associated with major sports events. For
example, BEA estimated that real outlays on spectator sports grew at
an annual rate of 41 percent in the third quarter of 1984, when the
Olympics were held in Los Angeles. This increase contributed less
than 0.1 percentage point to annualized growth in total PCE in that
quarter, however.

spending growth, the personal saving rate declined 1/2 percentage
point to 4.3 percent. Both disposable income and the saving rate
were held down by a temporary increase in personal tax payments
associated with the final installment on 1993 tax liabilities
incurred by high-income tax payers under the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. If these OBRA-93 tax payments had been
spread over all of 1996 (as is BEA's practice for regular tax
payments), real disposable income would have risen 2.7 percent in
the second quarter, and the saving rate would have declined by a
smaller amount, to 4.5 percent. More recently, the decline in
aggregate hours in July suggests a drop in private wages and
salaries in that month, although the movement will likely retrace
only a fraction of the huge June gain.
Consumer sentiment strengthened further in July. The Michigan
Survey Research Center index of consumer sentiment rose 2 points,
reaching its highest level since last summer, and the Conference
Board index surged to its highest value in more than six years.
Consumers expressed more positive views about most aspects of their
personal situations and economic conditions more generally. Views
of current and future employment conditions registered a
particularly large improvement. The greater optimism may have been
associated with the favorable June employment report, as many
respondents to the SRC survey mentioned the decline in the
unemployment rate when asked about recent economic developments.
Housing Markets
At least through June, this year's rise in mortgage rates
appears to have put no more than a modest dent in single-family
building activity. Starts in June are estimated to have risen to
1.23 million units, the highest level in more than two years, while
permits--a more reliable indicator statistically--were off only
modestly from the peak rate of the spring quarter.
The June readings on sales of new and existing homes suggest
some slackening in demand, but the still-high levels through early
August for builders' ratings of new home sales (preliminary) and for
mortgage applications to finance home purchases would seem to
indicate that activity may be slipping quite gradually. As shown in
the Michigan survey for July, consumer attitudes toward homebuying
had leveled out in recent months, after turning slightly less
positive early in the year. The proportion of households that
mentioned a concern about rising mortgage rates as a reason for home

buying has remained about unchanged in recent months after rising in
the spring.
Price increases for new and existing homes slowed in the second
quarter of this year. The constant-quality new home price index
rose just 1.9 percent from the year-earlier level; this rise was
roughly in line with the moderate rates of increase in 1995. The
reduced growth of new home prices occurred despite a rapid increase
in lumber prices and may reflect an effort by builders to avoid
creating "sticker shock" that could result from a combination of
rising mortgages rates and increasing home prices. A survey of home
builders showed that concern about lumber prices and supply
increased substantially in the second quarter but that somewhat
greater concern was expressed about housing affordability. The
repeat-sales price index for existing homes rose 5.1 percent, year
over year, in the second quarter, down only slightly from its pace
in the first quarter--the highest since late 1989.
Multifamily housing starts dropped 20 percent in June,
continuing the up-and-down pattern that has prevailed so far this
year. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units edged up in the
second quarter, compared with a year earlier, marking the third
consecutive quarter in which vacancies have risen on a year-over-
year basis; this suggests that apartment construction for the nation
as a whole has outpaced demand.
Business Fixed Investment
According to BEA's advance estimate, real business fixed
investment increased at an annual rate of only 0.5 percent in the
second quarter. Key source data released subsequently suggest that
this estimate will be revised upward to something over 3 percent, a
pace still much lower than the 11.6 percent gain posted in the first
quarter. Smoothing through the quarterly swings, growth over the
first half probably was about 7-1/4 percent at an annual rate, just
a little above the 6.4 percent rise over the four quarters of 1995.
These figures are below the peak rates of the cycle, as would be
expected on the basis of waning accelerator effects and moderating
cash flow growth.
Factoring in shipments data for June, we estimate that real
outlays for PDE rose between 4 and 5 percent at an annual rate in
the second quarter, compared with a 13 percent annual pace in the
first quarter. Real domestic aircraft outlays were particularly
weak. While shipments by domestic producers increased 10 percent

(quarterly rate) in the second quarter, an unusually large fraction
of these shipments was exported. All told, the large drop in
domestic aircraft outlays subtracted about 3 percentage points from
real PDE growth in the second quarter.
Outlays for real office and computing equipment posted another
hefty gain in the second quarter, although growth was down from the
stratospheric rate posted in the first quarter. While expenditures
tailed off in nominal terms, real expenditures were amplified by an
accelerated decline in BEA's computer deflator, which dropped 20
percent at an annual rate in the second quarter versus 15 percent in
the first. The fast descent of computer prices reflected in part a
pass-through of the recent sharp decline in semiconductor
9prices.
Other components of PDE continued to grow at a steady clip in
the second quarter. Real business purchases of communications
equipment increased at an annual rate of 10 percent, a slight
step-up from the first-quarter pace. Purchases of other types of
equipment advanced at about the same brisk pace as in the first
quarter, with outlays for industrial equipment posting an especially
noteworthy increase.
Very little information is available to get a fix on PDE for
the current quarter. Nominal bookings for office and computing
equipment rose in June but were about flat for the second quarter as
a whole. Given the sharp price declines experienced in that sector
on net over the past few months, this suggests that unit sales
likely are holding up well.10 Elsewhere, the picture is more
9. The continued strength in this sector may seem surprising,
given that many computer and semiconductor manufacturers have seen
their stock prices drop off sharply. Memory chip manufacturer
Micron, for example, has lost about three-quarters of its value over
the past year. IOmega, a "hot" disk drive manufacturer has lost
more than half of its value since May. Such corrections have
generally affected semiconductor manufacturers, who face
dramatically increased competitive forces this year spawned by rapid
capacity growth, and trendy new technology issues, whose share
prices arguably far outstripped any sensible valuation. In
contrast, such blue chip computer companies as Intel, Microsoft, and
Compaq have posted very positive earnings reports and have seen
their share prices move quite favorably.
10. Anecdotal reports suggest that office and computing equipment
will continue to be a source of strength for the remainder of the
year. Indeed, a hardware upgrade wave may occur over the coming
months. Microsoft announced the release of the MS Windows NT 4.0
operating system on July 31. This new operating system, which is
expected to be in heavy demand by corporate users, incorporates an
improved user interface, built-in Internet access, and expanded

mixed. Bookings for communications equipment dropped back
significantly in the second quarter, suggesting a slowing in
shipments of these goods in the third quarter. On the other hand,
orders for nondefense capital goods besides aircraft and information
processing equipment--the segment for which orders have the most
value as a leading indicator--increased in April, May, and June
after a sharp drop in March. In addition, unfilled orders for these
goods remained at a relatively healthy level, suggesting continued
gains in this component in the months ahead.
June data on nonresidential construction put-in-place were
somewhat stronger than the assumptions built into the advance NIPA
release, and we believe that the revised growth rate will be
approximately zero. A large drop in industrial construction
accounted for a good bit of the bad news in the second quarter.
Other commercial construction was down a tad, while lodging and
miscellaneous, office, institutional, and utility construction
posted healthy advances, as did drilling and mining activity.
Looking ahead, construction contracts have tailed off noticeably
this year, with contracts for industrial building dropping
especially sharply (chart). In contrast, anecdotal reports,
including those in the Beige Book, continue to describe a more
upbeat picture in the commercial building sector than is painted by
the contracts data.
Inventories
Inventory accumulation was modest in the second quarter, and
stocks in both manufacturing and trade appeared to be in good trim
at the end of the period.
In the trade sector, inventory-sales ratios for retailers of
some nondurable consumer goods in June were among their lowest
levels in two years. For the broad range of stores in the GAF
grouping, the ratio ticked up just a bit from its lowest level since
the current expansion began (chart). Wholesale trade inventories

tools for system administrators. At the same time, the new system
will put greater demands on existing hardware and could boost
purchases of computers based on Intel's Pentium and Pentium Pro
processors. As these prices have fallen to more favorable levels.
Intel expects unit shipments to grow significantly in the coming
months. The possible scope of the upgrading is suggested by
Dataquest's estimate that only about 25 percent of corporate PCs
have been upgraded to Pentiums.

fell again in June, with the biggest declines in stocks of apparel
and electrical goods; inventories held by most types of wholesale
establishments remained in line with sales.
In manufacturing, inventory corrections continued through June.
Excluding the volatile aircraft series, factory stocks fell at an
annual rate of $11.2 billion (book value) in June and $9.8 billion
for the second quarter as a whole. The sizable cutbacks left
inventories in most industries well-aligned with new orders and
shipments, and the stock-sales ratio for the manufacturing sector as
a whole in June about matched the low last seen in January 1995.
Much of manufacturers' recent book-value inventory liquidation
occurred in stocks of materials and supplies, where declining prices
likely played a part; the runoff may also reflect cautious plans for
near-term production.
Federal Government
The incoming news on the unified budget for fiscal 1996 has
continued to be favorable. For the first nine months of the fiscal
year, the budget deficit was $75 billion, $49 billion less than last
year.
Strong corporate profits and a probable increase in capital
gains realizations by individuals have raised receipts so far this
fiscal year 7 percent over the same period last year. Much of the
11 percent year-over-year growth in individual income taxes was
recorded in April nonwithheld taxes; according to Treasury data, the
April surge in nonwithheld taxes reflected extraordinary strength in
both final payments on 1995 liability and the first quarterly
estimated payment on 1996 liability. The second quarterly payment
on 1996 liability apparently was also large, as individual
nonwithheld taxes in June were 16 percent higher than last year.
The growth of outlays (adjusted for timing shifts and certain
financial transactions) was a subdued 2 percent so far this fiscal
year, owing in part to reductions in discretionary appropriations.
In addition, Medicaid outlays have risen only 2 percent, reflecting
restrained growth in health-care costs, tightened restrictions on
disbursements for disproportionate share hospitals, and an overall
slowing in caseloads.
Real federal expenditures for consumption and gross investment
increased at an 8.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
according to BEA's advance estimate. Large gains were recorded in
both the defense and the nondefense categories. The jump in outlays

for defense was in line with the data on a unified basis. However,
the second-quarter increase in nondefense spending appears a bit
anomalous, as such growth does not appear in the corresponding
unified budget accounts: consequently, we are anticipating a
downward revision in the estimate.
The Administration released its Mid-Session Review of the
Budget on July 16. The budget estimates incorporate revised
economic and technical assumptions, the effects of legislation
enacted between March and mid-July, and changes in proposed
policies. Under the President's proposals, the Administration now
projects that the deficit will be $117 billion in fiscal 1996, edge
up to $126 billion in fiscal 1997, and then fall steadily--turning
to surplus in fiscal 2001 and 2002. Relative to its March
projections, most of the Administration's revisions were attributed
to the unexpectedly large increase in individual income tax
collections in April, which resulted in upward revisions to receipts
of $27 billion in fiscal 1996 and about $10 billion in subsequent
years. The largest changes to economic assumptions were to ten-year
Treasury yields and near-term GDP growth; both were revised up.
Welfare reform legislation was recently passed by Congress, and
the President is expected to sign it shortly. The bill establishes
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant to replace
the main federal cash assistance program, Aid to Families with
Dependent Children, and three smaller, related programs. While each
state will have wide discretion in designing its program, it must
meet certain conditions in order to avoid a reduction in its federal
grant. In particular, (1) except in hardship cases, it cannot use
federal funds to provide assistance to families that have already
received five years of benefits after the effective date of the
block grant, (2) it must move a specified percentage of welfare
recipients into qualifying work-related activities, and (3) its
outlays for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 must equal or exceed
75 percent of its fiscal 1994 expenditures on the displaced federal
programs. The bill also consolidates several child care programs
into a single Child Protection block grant program, significantly
reduces public assistance payments to legal and illegal aliens,
reduces food stamp allotments, and limits the time that able-bodied
adults, age 18 to 50 without dependents, may receive food stamps
without working.

II-30
Other legislation passed by Congress raises the minimum wage,
reduces taxes for small businesses, reinstates the airline ticket
tax, and enacts a package of health insurance reforms.
State and Local Governments
Real spending by state and local governments jumped 6 percent
at an annual rate in the second quarter. This followed weather-
related weakness during the winter quarter and reflected strong
advances in real compensation and construction. State and local
government employment rose 40,000 in July, nearly twice the average
monthly increase during the first six months of the year. As in
June, the biggest advance was among educational workers employed by
local governments, a category for which seasonal adjustment is
especially difficult.
A recent survey from the National Conference of State
Legislatures confirms the continuing improvement in state general
fund budgets, as ending balances increased as a percentage of
expenditures for the fourth consecutive year in fiscal 1996. The
strengthening picture is attributed to rising revenues combined with
restrained growth in spending. Reserves are expected to remain
strong in fiscal 1997. Outlays for corrections once again should
increase rapidly, and spending on higher education is expected to
increase at its fastest pace since the late 1980s as states try to
restore funding. Meanwhile, growth in spending for Medicaid is
expected to slow to around 4 percent, owing to declining caseloads,
federal reform actions, and state managed-care programs. The survey
was taken before the federal welfare reform was enacted, but the
states anticipated a further drop in outlays for AFDC this year on
the expectation that the expanding national economy and various
welfare reform measures in many states would help reduce growth in
caseloads.
The recently passed federal welfare legislation is supportive
of state programs that seek to reduce caseloads, and states will no
longer have to receive federal waivers before reducing payments or
imposing time limits. However, some provisions of the new federal
bill--especially those affecting immigrants--could result in greater
state funding of services. In addition, the administrative burdens
of several programs likely will rise.
Labor Costs
Recent data on hourly compensation indicate that labor costs
are gradually accelerating. In the second quarter, the employment

II-31
cost index (ECI) for private industry workers rose at an annual rate
of 3.2 percent, somewhat faster than its first-quarter pace of
2.9 percent and the 2.6 percent rate registered in the second half
of 1995. Over the year ended in June, ECI hourly compensation
increased 2.9 percent--about a quarter percentage point above the
low for the twelve-month change in the series reached in the second
half of 1995.
The wages and salaries component of the ECI rose 3.6 percent
(annual rate)--apart from the 4-1/4 percent surge in the first
quarter, the biggest increase since the second quarter of 1991. One
factor was the rapid acceleration in the wages and salaries of sales
workers in wholesale trade and in finance, insurance, and real
estate. But outside of sales workers, growth in wages and salaries
was 1/4 percentage point higher in the past twelve months than in
the year-earlier period, with greater wage gains for professional
specialty workers and managerial workers leading the way.
Benefits costs were up at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the
second quarter, but this came after essentially no change in the
first three months of this year and did not reverse a favorable
trend.11  The twelve-month change in hourly benefits costs was
smaller than in the year-earlier period; this slowing largely
reflected decelerating costs for health insurance, workers'
compensation, retirement and savings, and nonproduction bonuses.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, as
measured by the productivity and costs (P&C) data, rose 3.7 percent
at an annual rate in the second quarter and 3.8 percent over the
past year. The second-quarter increase in compensation per hour was
somewhat faster than that in the ECI, but discrepancies between
12these two measures are common. In the present instance, faster
growth in the wages and salaries component of P&C compensation was
only partially offset by slower growth in the benefits component.
11. The current report corrected processing errors in the
previously published figures for 1995:Q4 and 1996:Q1. The most
notable change was a 2.1 percentage point downward revision to the
growth in benefits costs in 1995:Q4. For total compensation, growth
in 1995:Q4 was revised down 0.6 percentage point. Growth in 1996:Q1
was not revised, as a downward revision to wages and salaries was
offset by an upward revision to benefits. The general effect of the
corrections was to smooth the progression of compensation gains over
the past few quarters.
12. On a quarterly basis, the absolute difference between the two
measures has averaged 1.5 percentage points (annual rate) since
1980.

The latest data on labor costs are average hourly earnings in
July, which fell 0.2 percent after a 0.8 percent rise in June. The
decline reflected changes in the composition of employment by
industry, and adjusting for these mix shifts, average hourly
earnings were unchanged in July. Taking a longer view, average
hourly earnings have risen 3.1 percent over the past year--in line
with the 3.2 percent rise in the comparable ECI for wages and
salaries of production or nonsupervisory workers.
An additional development that will shortly affect labor costs
is the recent passage of legislation to raise the federal minimum
wage a total of $0.90 per hour: from $4.25 per hour to $4.75 per
hour on October 1, 1996 and to $5.15 per hour on September 1, 1997.
The staff estimates that the direct effect of the 90-cent increase
will be to raise the average wage between 0.3 percent and
0.4 percent by September 1997 or a bit less than 0.2 percent in each
of the two years. As shown in the table, workers earning the
current minimum of $4.25 per hour (the second column) accounted for
less than 1/2 percent of the aggregate wage bill in 1995, and we
assume that this group's average hourly wage will increase about
20 percent.13 Some workers reporting current wage rates less
than $4.25 per hour (the first column) will likely receive wage
increases in step with the minimum wage, while others, including
tipped employees whose total hourly earnings already exceed $5.15 or
workers not covered by the legal minimum (such as certain
agricultural workers) may not receive any increase. Averaging
across these groups, we are assuming a 9 percent average increase in
the hourly wage for those workers currently earning less than the
minimum. Workers with wage rates somewhere between the current
minimum and the new higher minimum (the third column) constitute a
larger share of the aggregate wage bill and are assumed to receive
wage increases averaging about 8 percent to bring them up to the new
minimum. We also expect to see ripple effects on workers earning
just above the new, higher minimum wage (the fourth column) as
employers act to partially maintain the current structure of
relative wages. Although the assumed percentage increase in the
average wage rate of this latter group is smaller than for the other
13. The legislated increase in the statutory minimum wage is
21.2 percent, but some would receive increases during the period
anyway. In the second through fourth columns we have made
allowances for this.

groups, it represents a larger share of the aggregate wage bill and
thus makes a larger contribution to the total effect.14 The
overall effect of the minimum wage hike will tend to be a bit
greater than the table indicates, to the extent that there are
feedbacks to wages from the price increases precipitated by the
minimum wage impulse.
Prices
Price inflation remained moderate on balance in June and July.
The consumer price index increased 0.3 percent in July but only
0.1 percent in the prior month. Excluding food and energy, the
index has been increasing 0.2 to 0.3 percent per month of late.
Over the twelve months ended in July, the overall CPI rose
3 percent, about the same as over the preceding twelve months; the
core index increased 2-3/4 percent in the latest twelve-month
period, down from a 3 percent increase in the year-earlier period.
14. Hourly workers earning more than $6 per hour and non-hourly
workers are assumed to be unaffected--which may result in a slight
understatement of the impact effect. In addition to the changes in
average wage rates for each group, we assume that employment will be
about 150,000 lower than otherwise; some of these workers will
remain structurally unemployed, effectively raising the NAIRU by a
small amount. In the above calculations, the workweek of the
disemployed workers is assumed to be 30 hours.

Retail energy prices have begun to follow crude oil prices back
down: The CPI for energy fell 2.2 percent in June and 0.4 percent
in July, after three months of large increases. Gasoline prices
posted large declines in June and July, while fuel oil prices have
been falling since May. Electricity rates were about flat, on
balance, in June and July, although consumer rebates for some
utilities in June generated large monthly swings.
Retail food prices increased 0.5 percent in July after a
0.7 percent increase in June. Meat prices pushed up food prices in
both months; fruit and vegetable prices were responsible for the
especially large increase in June. Prices of poultry and pork have
continued to increase rapidly, reflecting higher costs of feed
grains. Beef prices have also begun to be affected by rising feed
costs; earlier in the year, beef prices had been depressed by the
slaughter of cattle in anticipation of higher feed costs.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy was
unchanged for the third consecutive month in July. Over the past
six months, nonfood, non-energy goods prices have increased just
0.4 percent at an annual rate, down from a 2.3 percent pace in the
previous six-month period. Among categories contributing to this
deceleration were apparel and housekeeping supplies. The
deceleration in apparel prices may reflect exchange rate
developments, as the strength in the dollar early this year
depressed import prices. Prices of housekeeping supplies have
likely benefited from recent declines in input costs, notably for
paper and chemicals. Used car prices, which are quite volatile,
have also contributed to the recent deceleration in CPI goods
prices.
The CPI for services other than energy increased 0.3 percent in
June and July, in line with the average pace over the past year and
a half. Owners' equivalent rent--the largest component of the CPI--
increased 0.3 percent in July and just 0.1 percent in June, bringing
the increase over the past six months to 2.7 percent at an annual
rate, down from 3.6 percent over the preceding twelve-month period.
The volatile airfares component of the CPI has increased rapidly so
far this year. Looking ahead, a 10 percent federal air ticket tax
was reinstated in recent legislation, and, ceteris paribus, should
lead to further increases in air fares beginning this month.

Various broad measures of inflation are painting rather
different pictures of recent inflation developments. For example,
the GDP chain-type price index increased 0.5 percentage point less
in the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 1996 than in
the preceding four-quarter period, while the rate of increase in the
overall CPI has come down only 0.1 percentage point. As we noted in
the June Greenbook, the recent small increase in health care costs
is one of the main reasons that measures of inflation in the
national accounts have moved down more over the past year than has
the CPI: The recent deceleration in health services costs matters
more for PCE prices (and therefore for the rest of the national
accounts) both because the PCE data incorporate the PPI for medical
care and other data that have decelerated more sharply than the CPI

for medical services, and because the PCE chain-type price index
puts a larger weight on medical services than does the CPI.15
Industrial materials prices have continued to fall so far this
year: The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy
is down 1-1/4 percent through July, while the Journal of Commerce
industrial materials price index is off about 3 percent so far this
year. Apart from the general lack of pressure on industrial
capacity, a number of special factors have contributed to the
continued softness in nonfarm metals prices in particular. Most
notably, copper prices have plummeted in recent weeks after an
attempt by a Sumitomo Corporation unit to corner the copper market
was exposed. Less dramatically, aluminum prices have been depressed
over the past year or so by increased exports by Russia and other
nations of the former Soviet Union, where reduced defense
expenditures have freed capacity for the export market.16 Reduced
defense spending may also be restraining increases in the prices of
other metals, such as zinc and manganese, because the federal
government has been reducing its stockpiles as part of the ongoing
downsizing of the defense establishment.
Agriculture
Spot prices of agricultural crops have been extremely volatile
since June. The spot price for corn rose sharply in early July as
dry weather in the Corn Belt threatened this year's crop, but it
then began to drop in mid-July when rainfall in the Midwest reduced
fears of a poor harvest. This week it has surged once again in
response to a surprisingly low USDA estimate of the harvest. The
cash price of wheat, which has been less volatile, has generally
trended lower since June but remains in a high range by historical
standards.
The latest USDA crop production estimates, which now
incorporate data from actual field surveys of wheat, corn, and
soybeans, indicate that total crop output in 1996 is likely to show
15. Another factor that has contributed to smaller increases in
the PCE chain-type price index than in the CPI in recent years is
the use of more up-to-date weights in the PCE index than in the CPI.
The PCE chain-type price index uses weights from years adjacent to
the period for which the price change is calculated, whereas the CPI
currently uses weights from the 1982-to-1984 period. We estimate
that the difference in weights may explain 0.2 percentage point of
the difference between the CPI and PCE inflation rates in recent
years. The CPI will get revised weights--for the 1993-to-1995
period--in January 1998.

Soviet nations has unraveled over the past year.

a partial rebound from last year's low level. In its August report,
the USDA substantially lowered its estimate of corn yields this
year. In addition, harvested acreage is expected to be lower than
had been projected previously. The downward revisions to this
year's production estimates indicate that stocks of corn will likely
remain below comfortable levels over the coming year. The USDA
estimate of soybean production in 1996 was also lowered a bit;
soybean stocks have been tightening of late.
The USDA also has revised down its estimate of meat production
this year, reflecting reduced production estimates for pork.17
Smaller herds of both cattle and hogs and a reduction in the number
of cattle coming off feedlots have apparently begun to push up farm-
level prices for livestock somewhat sooner than most analysts had
expected. Prices for livestock have edged up in both spot and
futures markets, with cash prices of cattle and hogs substantially
higher than at the time of the last Greenbook.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
On balance, economic data released in recent weeks seem to have
diminished concerns somewhat among market participants that the
economy is overheating, and the associated bond market rally has
more than rolled back the jump in long-term yields posted in early
July. The thirty-year Treasury bond rate has declined about
40 basis points from its high last month and 15 points on net over
the intermeeting period, leaving it at its lowest level since April.
The markets remain jittery, however, exhibiting substantial
volatility in response to each piece of news.
Short-term rates have declined as well. Investors apparently
had been convinced that the stronger-than-expected June employment
report, released immediately after the July FOMC meeting, portended
a System tightening action in August. Data releases since then,
along with the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, eroded that conviction,
and rates on federal funds futures contracts now indicate that even
a modest tightening in the near term is viewed as not very likely
(chart, top panels).
Turbulent conditions have frequently prevailed in the stock
market as well, with intraday movements in the S&P 500 reaching
their highest level in more than five years. Stock prices declined
along with bond prices early in the intermeeting period and then
fell sharply in mid-July after several high-tech companies released
disappointing news about earnings and sales. By late in the month,
the S&P 500 was 7-1/2 percent below the peak reached in the spring,
while the NASDAQ Composite was down nearly 17 percent (chart, bottom
panel). Stock prices then began to recover, lifted by the rally in
the bond market and generally reassuring earnings reports. By mid-
August, the NYSE Composite index, the S&P 500, and the Dow had
almost returned to their record highs, but the NASDAQ Composite
remained well below its peak.
Borrowing by nonfederal sectors was moderate in the second
quarter and appears to have remained so early in the current
quarter. In the household sector, consumer credit growth has
continued to slow, while mortgage debt growth likely has subsided
further from the brisk first-quarter pace. Borrowing by
nonfinancial firms has been held down by still-healthy cash flows
and modest inventory investment. As has been true for a while,

state and local governments continue to pay down their outstanding
debt. The broad monetary aggregates decelerated last month, while
growth in bank credit remained sluggish.
Stock Market and Mutual Funds
Stock price movements over the past two months reflect a
cooling of enthusiasm for smaller, speculative companies. The
Russell 2000--a diversified index of small companies--has moved
lower in sync with the computer-laden NASDAQ Composite.
Furthermore, investor ardor for initial public offerings has
weakened quite a bit, although better-quality firms still have
access to the market. On net, nearly 20 percent of the IPOs
completed in the second half of June were priced below the low end
of the range filed in the registration statements about six weeks
earlier, a sharp reversal from the pattern in the spring, and this
measure turned even more negative in July and the first half of
August (chart, top panel). In addition, the average first-day price
increase for IPOs has fallen to a two-year low so far this quarter,
albeit from a high level.
The decline in broad equity indexes since midyear has left only
a modest imprint in standard measures of stock valuation. The
price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 remains at the high end of the
range of the past decade (middle panel). The P-E ratio for the
NASDAQ Composite came down somewhat in July as well but was still
elevated by historical standards.
With nearly all reports on second-quarter earnings now in,
operating income appears to have remained on a healthy growth path.
Operating earnings at S&P 500 firms are estimated to have increased
about 8 percent for the year ending in June, near what was posted in
the previous quarter but well below the very rapid gains from
mid-1994 to mid-1995 (lower left panel). Analysts expect
earnings growth to pick up by year-end and hold extremely bullish
views about long-term prospects (lower right panel), even though the
economy is thought to be pressing against capacity.
Retail investors' accumulation of stocks likely flagged in
July, as net sales of equity mutual funds declined substantially
from the record pace in the first half of the year (chart, upper
panel). Equity funds actually posted a net outflow in the week
1. The closest analogue to this measure in the national income
and product accounts is book profits after tax. That measure, which
covers all U.S. corporations, also has decelerated from the high
growth rates posted from mid-1994 to mid-1995.

ended July 17, when the stock market was most turbulent. Net sales
of aggressive growth funds, which invest in small and medium-sized
firms, dried up last month (middle panel). The same was true for
growth stock funds, a diverse group that focuses on achieving
capital gains. In contrast, growth and income funds, the most
conservative group of equity funds, experienced a far milder slowing
of inflows last month. Preliminary data show that inflows to equity
funds jumped during the first week in August.
In light of the outflow in mid-July, some industry observers
have raised concerns about the liquidity of stock funds. However,
even though the average liquidity ratio for all stock funds has
declined to 6-1/2 percent (bottom left panel), the one-week outflow
last month represented less than 1/2 percent of stock fund assets.
Moreover, the riskier funds, which accounted for most of the
outflows, generally have higher liquidity ratios than the average
stock fund (bottom right panel). Many fund complexes also have
reportedly taken steps in recent years to augment their liquidity
positions by taking out committed lines of credit, establishing
informal arrangements with custodian banks, and even arranging for
inter-fund borrowing in the event of a liquidity crisis.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The recent volatility in capital markets does not seem to have
enhanced the appeal of monetary assets. In fact, M2 and M3 slowed
to 2-1/4 and 3-3/4 percent annual rates, respectively, in July,
placing both aggregates below the upper bounds of their annual
ranges. Retail money market mutual funds, which typically serve as
a refuge during periods of gyrating capital markets, registered
reduced inflows in July. A steep decline in demand deposits also
held down growth in the aggregates. While the extent of the runoff
in demand deposits is surprising, it does follow several months of
unexplained strength. Other checkable deposits continued to fall,
as about $8 billion of new sweep arrangements came on line in July.
The weaker growth in M2 showed through to M3, despite the
brisker expansion of large time deposits, in part because inflows to
institutional money market mutual funds abated some. In addition,
bank funding needs have been weak, with bank credit in July growing
at a rate in the neighborhood of 1 percent for a third month. Loan
growth slowed to a 3-3/4 percent rate, as a small pickup in business
loan growth was more than offset by slower expansion of consumer and
real estate loans held in banks' portfolios.

Security holdings at banks, which had grown sluggishly for the
last two years, contracted in June and July. In part, this behavior
seems to represent a return to a more typical relationship between
security holdings and bank credit (chart). In the early 1990s, when
bank loan portfolios were troubled and banks became highly cautious
lenders, the share of securities in bank portfolios climbed
substantially. Beginning in 1994, after bank capital positions
became comfortable again and loan demand strengthened, the
securities share began to decline. This trend has continued in
1996, even as loan demand has moderated.
The subdued lending in recent months does not appear to have
been driven by a more restrictive posture on credit availability.
Banks reported strong earnings for the second quarter, and capital
positions are favorable. Results from the August Senior Loan
Officer Survey showed some tightening for loans to households, but
otherwise banks reported little change in loan supply.
Household Sector
Household borrowing is estimated to have moderated in the
second quarter, and the sparse data available do not point to a
rebound in the current quarter. Much of the slowing reflects weaker
growth in consumer credit, which slid to a 7-1/2 percent annual rate
last quarter, despite some firming in June (table and chart). In
July, consumer loans at banks grew at a 7 percent rate after
adjusting for securitization, somewhat below its second-quarter
pace.
The deceleration in consumer debt probably owes more to slower
growth in demand for credit than to a cutback in supply. Interest
rates on consumer loans have been fairly steady this year (table),
and unused lines of credit on credit card accounts at commercial
banks continued to expand very rapidly through the first quarter,
reaching $1.2 trillion. Furthermore, any tightening of standards in
granting new credit lines would not prevent people from drawing on
existing lines of credit.
That said, tighter lending standards may exert some damping
effect on consumer credit growth going forward. Banks are
continuing to scrutinize their consumer lending programs and, on
net, have become less willing to make consumer loans in recent
months according to participants in the August loan officer survey
(chart, middle panel). A tightening of standards was most evident
in the credit card area, where delinquencies and charge-offs have

risen the most, although a number of respondents reported tightening
standards for other installment loans as well. Asked specifically
about the use of credit scoring to evaluate applications, 90 percent
of the card-issuing banks employed this tool, and 40 percent of
those had set cutoff scores at more restrictive levels in the past
three months.
Among the few data series now available on consumer loan
repayments in the second quarter, the captive auto finance companies
experienced a rise in delinquency rates to a historical high, after
a decline in the first quarter. Earlier, these companies indicated
that they had anticipated an uptrend as a result of having
liberalized credit standards in 1993-94 to help boost car sales.3
A definitive estimate of mortgage debt growth for the second
quarter cannot be made until data become available from Call
Reports, but the heavy issuance of mortgage-backed securities
suggests that, all else equal, loan originations were quite strong.
Real estate loan growth at commercial banks slowed last quarter, but
some of that deceleration apparently owed to heavy securitization of
home equity loans: During the first half of the year,
securitizations at all lenders were about double the pace set last
year, and the second-quarter volume was the highest on record
(bottom panel). Growth in real estate loans at commercial banks
remained modest in July.
Business Finance
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations in July
backed off from the strong pace of the previous two months (table).
Speculative-grade issuance accounted for most of the decline,
falling to less than half its average monthly pace during the first
half of the year. Market contacts indicated that a number of highly
speculative offerings that had been on the calendar were postponed
or withdrawn as investors backed away amidst the turbulence in the
capital markets last month. Of the investment-grade bonds issued in
July, some of the proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper.
As a result, outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial firms

3. The level of the delinquency rate at captive finance companies
has also been boosted a bit by the shift away from loans toward
leasing. Leases are not included in the loan delinquency data, and
lease customers tend to be better credit risks than the average
borrower.

declined slightly last month, after having grown only a bit over the
second quarter (bottom left panel).
The drop in stock prices damped equity issuance by nonfinancial
firms from the record pace of the second quarter. Still, issuance
in July slightly exceeded the first-quarter pace, and data on
securities registrations suggest that issuance will be fairly well
maintained this month.
Meanwhile, equity retirements at nonfinancial firms remained
heavy in the second quarter, with the retirements coming about
equally from mergers and share repurchases. Merger activity has
remained robust since early July. However, because most of the
recently announced mergers have been structured as stock swaps,
merger-related share retirements for 1996 will likely fall below
last year's pace. In contrast, announcements of share repurchase
programs have continued to come at a blistering pace (bottom right
panel), and completed repurchases are expected to increase
20 percent this year.
The creditworthiness of firms in the nonfinancial sector has
remained strong in the past few months. The business failure rate
and the default rate on junk bonds are near their lows of the past
decade. The aggregate debt-to-equity ratio for nonfinancial firms
has held to its lowest level in the current decade, and gross
interest expense to cash flow remains quite low as well (chart,
upper panels). Spreads of speculative-grade bonds over those on
Treasuries have dropped back this year and the current level is
extremely tight (bottom left panel). The narrow spreads have
spurred an increased volume of junk bond issuance in recent years,
boosting the share of these bonds in total nonfinancial bonds
outstanding to the highest level in the past decade (bottom right
panel). This increased share, while a favorable indicator of
current credit availability for speculative-grade firms, does raise
the possibility of higher corporate bond defaults down the road.
Treasury and Agency Financing
The federal government is expected to post a budget deficit of
$43 billion during the current quarter (table). Much of the
associated financing need was met by the midquarter refunding, which
raised $39 billion and included three-, ten-, and thirty-year
securities. As is typical when the midquarter refunding includes a
thirty-year bond, the Treasury will pay down bills during the
quarter.

At its midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasury
clarified several aspects of its proposal to issue index-linked
debt. Even though it has not fully decided the characteristics of
the new bonds, it announced that they will be eligible for the
Treasury's stripping program from the date of issuance and that it
will eventually issue several maturities of inflation-protected
securities. The Treasury also announced that it will make the
complete specifications known in September and may conduct an
auction for the new debt instruments before the end of the year.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under increased scrutiny
in recent months, with both the Treasury and the Congressional
Budget Office claiming that these institutions fail to pass on to
mortgage borrowers all of the implicit subsidies they receive from
the government. These government-sponsored enterprises have strong
political support, and the market evidently sees little chance that
the agencies would be privatized, as spreads on their securities to
comparable Treasuries have remained tight.
The House Banking Committee approved a plan to fund the
payment of interest on the Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds issued
to finance the savings and loan bailout. A floor vote could be
scheduled in early September. The bonds' principal is backed by
zero-coupon Treasury securities, but interest is currently paid out
of the premiums of the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The
House Banking Committee's plan would require thrifts to pay
58 percent of the annual interest payments for three years, while
banks would pay the remainder; thereafter, payments would be
proportional to deposit holdings, implying that banks would pay
roughly three-quarters of FICO interest. Yield spreads on FICO
securities suggest that the market has been placing negligible odds
on default all through the recent legislative wrangling.
Municipal Financing
Gross offerings of long-term municipal debt decreased to
$11 billion in July from about $18 billion in June (table). Both
new capital issuance and refundings were down in July, consistent
with the usual seasonal pattern, and remained relatively low in
early August. In contrast, retirements increased substantially in
July, causing a sharp reduction in the supply of outstanding
municipal debt. Partly as a result, the tax-exempt yield on thirty-
year bonds fell to 81 percent of that of comparable Treasury bonds
in early August, the lowest level in a year.

The credit quality of municipal debt, as measured by changes in
ratings, improved in the first half of the year (chart). Virtually
all sectors of the municipal market experienced a net upgrade. The
only deterioration occurred among utilities, which accounted for
more than 90 percent of all municipal debt downgraded in the first
half. As in the private sector, municipal utilities face heightened
competitive pressures as a result of ongoing deregulation.

APPENDIX
THE AUGUST SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON
BANK LENDING PRACTICES
The August 1996 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices posed questions about changes in bank lending
standards and terms, changes in loan demand by businesses and
households, credit-scoring models used to evaluate credit card
applications, charge-off rates on consumer loans, and commercial
credit card programs.
The survey results showed little change in lending standards
for loans to businesses but a tightening of standards for loans to
consumers. Lending standards for commercial and industrial loans to
borrowers of all sizes were generally unchanged, as were standards
for commercial real estate loans. Standards for home mortgages were
also about unchanged, but many banks tightened standards for credit
card and other consumer installment loans.
Loan terms were reportedly eased moderately for businesses but
tightened somewhat for consumers. Terms were eased for business
loans to borrowers of all sizes, although more banks reported easing
them for large borrowers than for small borrowers. Terms on credit
card loans, especially credit limits, were tightened by many banks,
and a few banks tightened terms on other consumer installment loans.
Changes in demand for bank loans were mixed across loan types.
Several banks reported increased demand for commercial and
industrial loans, and a few reported increased demand for commercial
real estate loans. However, demand for home mortgages was
reportedly weaker at many banks while, for consumer installment
loans, the number of respondents who reported weaker demand was
about the same as the number who reported stronger demand.
Regarding credit-scoring models, most banks use such models to
evaluate some or all of their credit card applications, and about
half of those banks said that they had tightened the cutoff scores
necessary to qualify for a card. Responses to other special
questions indicate that many banks are charging off consumer loans
at a higher-than-expected rate given the delinquency rate on these
loans at their bank. These banks attribute this development largely
to a rise in bankruptcies with a short intervening period of
delinquency. A series of special questions on commercial credit
card programs found that many banks have adopted such programs over
the past few years, but the credit balances represent only a small
fraction of commercial and industrial loans.
Lending to Businesses
As in May, the survey found little change, on net, in lending
standards for business loans to firms of all sizes over the past
three months (chart). A few banks, on net, eased standards for
loans to large corporations, but standards for smaller firms were
essentially unchanged. The survey again found an easing of terms on
commercial and industrial loans; about a quarter of the banks, on
net, eased spreads over base rates for loans to large and
middle-market firms, although only about 5 percent, on net, eased
spreads for small businesses (chart). The proportions that reported
III-A-1

III-A-2
easing spreads were a bit smaller than in the May survey, continuing
the downward trend evident over the past year. The proportion that
reported reducing credit line costs was similar to the proportion
that reported easing spreads over base rates. Smaller proportions
eased other terms, including maximum credit line sizes, loan
covenants, and collateralization requirements. In contrast,
respondents that are U.S. offices of foreign banks indicated a
slight tightening of both standards and terms on commercial and
industrial loans. Those banks that eased terms or standards
indicated that they did so primarily because of increased
competition from other banks and, to a lesser extent, from nonbank
lenders. Those banks that tightened terms or standards indicated
that they did so because of a reduced tolerance for risk and because
of reduced competition from other banks.
On net, between 10 and 20 percent of respondents indicated an
increase in demand for commercial and industrial loans, with the
largest proportion reporting increased demand from small businesses
(chart). Banks attributed changes in demand to variations in their
customers' investment in inventories, plant, and equipment and to
substitution toward and away from other sources of finance. Banks
also indicated that demand from large corporations and middle-market
firms was boosted by merger and acquisition financing.
Domestic respondents reported a slight tightening of standards
for commercial real estate loans while foreign respondents indicated
little change in standards for these loans. Small net proportions
of both foreign and domestic respondents experienced an increase in
demand for commercial real estate loans.
Lending to Households
The survey found little evidence of changing standards for
home mortgages; only two banks indicated tighter standards and all
the rest reported no change. About a quarter of the banks, on net,
reported weaker demand for these loans (chart). This reported
weakness is in line with the recent modest growth in the outstanding
value of these loans at commercial banks but is at odds with recent
strength in the housing market.
The survey results were generally supportive of the view that
banks are pulling back, somewhat, in their lending to consumers. As
in May, a small net fraction of the respondents--less than ten
percent--reported a decline over the preceding three months in
their willingness to make consumer installment loans. These
results represent the first two consecutive surveys finding a net
reduction in willingness to make consumer installment loans since
1981. Moreover, larger net proportions of banks reported having
tightened consumer loan standards and terms than did so in May.
Nearly half of the banks tightened their standards for approving
credit card applications and about a quarter tightened standards for
other consumer installment loans. Nearly a third of the banks
lowered their credit limits on new or existing credit card accounts,
and smaller proportions increased spreads over market rates on
credit cards and other consumer installment loans. Banks reported
little net change in demand for consumer installment loans.
In response to special questions, about 90 percent of the
banks reported using credit-scoring models to evaluate some or all
of their credit card applications. Of those using such models, 40
percent had made the average cutoff score to qualify for a credit

III-A-3
card more restrictive over the past three months and just over half
had done so over the past year.
Responses to other special questions revealed that two-thirds
of the banks are charging off consumer loans at a higher rate than
they would have expected at current delinquency rates, given their
past experience. Virtually all of the banks experiencing higher
charge-off rates indicated that a very important reason for the high
rate was that more customers were declaring bankruptcy with little
or no intervening period of delinquency. Many banks also indicated
that a larger fraction of their delinquent loans were remaining
delinquent long enough to be charged off.
Commercial Credit Cards
A series of special questions asked banks about commercial
credit card programs. Commercial card products include business
cards, which are generally for smaller businesses; corporate cards,
which are generally for travel and entertainment expenses incurred
by large corporations; and purchasing cards, which are generally for
modest business purchases, other than for travel and entertainment,
by large corporations. About two-thirds of the respondents
indicated that they currently offer at least one of these types of
credit card, and many banks offer all three. Of the programs, the
largest number of banks offered business cards, followed by
corporate and then purchasing cards. About half of the banks
offering one or more of these programs had started them within the
past three years, and many of them reported growth in outstandings
over the past year of more than 10 percent. Nevertheless, the
outstanding balances on these cards do not represent a large
fraction of business lending. Almost all the banks said that the
balances account for less than 2 percent of their commercial and
industrial loans and less than 5 percent of their lending to small
businesses. When asked about their plans to start new programs, a
few banks expressed an intention to offer business or corporate
cards in the near future while a somewhat larger number planned to
offer purchasing cards.

In April-May, the deficit in net exports at an annual rate was
substantially larger than in the first quarter, back to levels last
recorded a year earlier.
Exports of goods and services were 1-1/2 percent higher in
April-May on average than in the first quarter, with most of the
increase in deliveries of aircraft and shipments of gold abroad1.
Over the past year, the value of exports rose 7 percent (Q2e/Q2).
Imports of goods and services were 4 percent higher in April-
May on average than in the first quarter, with two-thirds of the
increase attributable to oil and transfers of gold. The remaining
increase was predominantly in automotive products (reflecting the
strength of sales) and consumer goods. Partly offsetting these
increases was a sharp decline in imported semiconductors. The
strong pick-up in imports in the first five months of the year is
consistent with rising U.S. domestic demand.
1Gold transferred from foreign holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York is recorded first as an import into the United States and
shows up as an export when gold is shipped out of the country.

Oil Imports
The quantity of oil imported during April and May was well
above the 1996-Ql rate. A larger than normal seasonal inventory
accumulation that has rebuilt stocks from historically low levels
offset the seasonal decline in oil consumption. Preliminary
Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports continued
at a brisk pace in June, due to a pick-up in consumption and a
continuation of the rebuilding of oil stocks, but fell in July as
consumption declined and the accumulation of stocks ceased.
After a sharp rise in April, the price of imported oil fell
back in May and decreased sharply in June. Spot WTI declined more
than $0.80 per barrel in June, averaging $20.45 per barrel. The
decline in oil prices from April through June reflected an unwinding
of temporary shocks to the oil market (unusually cold weather in
North America and Japan and weather related production disruptions
in the North Sea and Australia). Although Iraq reached an agreement
with the United Nations in early July to export a limited quantity
of oil (estimated to be 800,000 b/d) under U.N. supervision, oil
prices have remained firm since then because of uncertainty
regarding the timing of these oil flows. Prices rose nearly a dollar
per barrel in July and have changed little in August. Spot WTI is
now trading in the $22.00 per barrel range.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of non-oil imports decreased in the second quarter at a
rate that was slightly more than in the two previous quarters. The
prices of imported capital goods and industrial supplies fell
sharply. These decreases were only partly offset by substantial
price increases in a broad array of imported foods (coffee, grains,
and vegetables).
Prices of exports increased in the second quarter with most of
the rise due to a rapid increase in agricultural prices (especially
grains). On balance, prices of non-agricultural exports fell, with
continued declines seen in prices of industrial supplies and
computers.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The pace of foreign official inflows into the United States
slowed sharply in the second quarter from the record pace of the
first quarter. (See line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International

IV-6
Transactions table.) Intervention purchases of dollars by the G-10
countries were modest. In addition, the increases in holdings by
several developing countries in Latin America in the first quarter
were partially reversed in the second quarter. In July and early
August partial information from FRBNY suggests that increases in
official holdings in the United States picked up somewhat.
Net portfolio investment by private foreigners in U.S.
securities (line 4) exceeded U.S. investment in foreign securities
(line 5) by a wider margin in the second quarter than in the first.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a)
picked up from the first-quarter pace, largely reflecting the
volatile transactions of financial institutions in the Caribbean.
The large net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities by official and
private foreigners in the first half of 1996 brought the foreign
share of U.S. Treasury securities privately held to almost 29
percent at the end of June, the highest level in recent decades.
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate and government
agency bonds (line 4b) were also large in the second quarter, as
were foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks (line 4c).
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) in the
second quarter were substantial, but below the first-quarter pace.
Net purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) fell sharply and purchases
of stocks (line 5b) also declined. In the second quarter, the
United Kingdom replaced Japan as the single country where U.S. net
purchases of stocks were largest. During the first half of 1996
there was a modest pickup in U.S. investor interest in emerging
stock markets in Asia and Latin America, but net purchases remained
far below the 1993 peak rate.
Banks continued to report substantial net capital outflows in
the second quarter on a month-end basis (line 3). On a monthly
average basis, net outflows also were recorded from U.S. banking
offices to their own foreign offices and IBFs (see line 1 of the
International Banking Data table). These outflows coincided with
slow growth in U.S. commercial bank credit and a pickup in growth of
large time deposits.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets
The weighted-average dollar has declined 1-3/8 percent on
balance since the time of the July FOMC meeting. Contributing to
the dollar's decline was a reduction of market expectations about
the pace of U.S. activity and the consequent probability of a near-
term tightening of U.S. monetary policy.
Against individual currencies, the dollar's movements during
the period have been diverse. The dollar has declined 2-1/4 percent
against the mark, but it has moved down significantly less against
many other major European currencies, as doubts reemerged about the
timetable for, and perhaps even the ultimate success of, European
Monetary Union (EMU). The decision of the Bundesbank Council to
leave the German RP rate unchanged after its July 25 meeting took
markets by surprise, coming as it did after numerous statements from
Council members indicating that such a reduction would not be
unreasonable, and resulted in a strengthening of the mark against
many of the other European currencies. The French franc came under
additional downward pressures, sinking to a 4-month low against the
mark during the period, amid rumors--later denied--that high-level
French and German officials had met to discuss delaying the start of
EMU, reports that France's fiscal deficit may come in well over the
Maastricht criterion of 3 percent of GDP in 1997, and indications
that the French government was seeking to pressure Bank of France
Governor Trichet into taking an easier policy stance to help the
ailing French economy. While the Bank of France did on separate
occasions lower its money-market intervention rate and its 5-to-10-
day RP rate 5 and 15 basis points, respectively, during the period,
both short-term and long-term differentials between market rates in
France and Germany have widened somewhat.
Despite the steady policy of the Bundesbank, the Bank of Italy
lowered its discount rate during the period 3/4 percentage point to
8-1/4 percent, as the Italian inflation rate in both June and July
came in below 4 percent. The move had been widely anticipated and
caused little immediate reaction in the markets.

The Swiss franc has risen more than 1 percent against the mark
during the period and 3-1/2 percent against the dollar, as financial
market uncertainties and perhaps also concerns about the health of
Russian President Yeltsin led investors to seek the Swiss currency
as a safe haven. The strength of the franc prompted Swiss National
Bank officials to declare that the currency was massively
overvalued--a judgment confirmed by Federal Reserve Staff back from
a recent visit to Basle.
The dollar has declined more than 2 percent against the yen,
against a background of data releases during the period showing the
Japanese current account surplus beginning to widen again. Public
complaints from major U.S. exporters that the yen was too weak
provided further reminders to the market of the resumption of
growing trade imbalances. The dollar has firmed 1/2 percent against
sterling, for reasons that are not clear. The dollar has also
firmed against the Canadian dollar, up 1 percent since the July 3
meeting. In reaction to data showing Canadian economic activity
still well below potential and inflation still low, Canadian
authorities reduced their target range for the overnight interest
rate a cumulative 1/2 percentage point in two moves during the
period.
Foreign equity prices moved down on balance during the
intermeeting period, although for many countries they ended somewhat
above the period lows. The largest net declines occurred in Italy
and Japan, whose stock prices moved down more than 8 percent and 6
percent, respectively. The latter country's market was particularly
hard hit by news of further problems in its banking sector.
In a new foray into international capital markets, on August 7
the Bank of Mexico conducted its first monthly auction of dollar put
options. The purpose of these auctions is to offer instruments by
which the Bank of Mexico can build its international reserves
gradually without unduly affecting the day-to-day peso market. The
central bank sold all of the options it offered at the auction at an
average premium of 1.168 centavos per dollar. The strike price of
the options on any given day will be the previous day's reference
exchange rate (providing that the rate is no weaker than the average

IV-12
exchange rate of the preceding twenty trading days.) By August 13,
all of $130 million in outstanding options had been exercised.
.The
Desk did not intervene for U.S. monetary authorities during the
period. In reserve management activity, the Desk invested DM 325
million of System balances and DM 175 million of Treasury balances
in 6-month "Bubills," which were auctioned for the first time by the
German Finance Ministry on July 17. The bills yield 3.18 percent.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available indicators for the second quarter suggest that the
pace of economic activity varied considerably across the major
foreign industrial countries. In Japan, activity appears to have
been positive but obviously well below its remarkable first-quarter
pace. The German economy shows signs of having rebounded sharply
from the contraction in the first quarter, with industrial
production and orders well above their first-quarter levels. In
France and Italy, growth has fallen back from its pace in the first
quarter, with both economies evidencing signs of contraction. The
United Kingdom and Canada continue to experience modest rates of
expansion.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued. Recent consumer-price
inflation has averaged about 1-1/2 percent in Germany and Canada and
under 3 percent in the United Kingdom and France. Italian
inflation, while higher than in the other foreign G-7 countries, has
slowed considerably since January and neared 3-1/2 percent in July.
In Japan, prices are rising slightly this year, reflecting
depreciation of the yen, after declining through most of 1995.
Individual country notes. In Japan, economic indicators for
the second quarter point to positive but much slower expansion of
growth in real GDP after an increase of 12.7 percent (SAAR) in the
first quarter. New machinery orders and housing starts continued to
rise in the second quarter, while industrial production fell
slightly and new car registrations declined. Although the
unemployment rate reached a 40-year high of 3.5 percent in May and
June, this increase was largely due to new entrants into the labor

IV-13
market, as the ratio of job offers to job applicants continued to
increase gradually.
Month-to-month changes in wholesale and consumer prices have
been positive in recent months. These increases stem from the
effect of past yen depreciation on import prices as prices of
domestically produced goods have continued to decline.

The Japanese trade surplus has increased over the past two
months following many months of decline. The June merchandise trade
surplus was $6.4 billion (SA) compared with $4.8 billion in May.
The June current account surplus was $6.2 billion (SA) compared with
$5.8 billion in May.
Real activity in Germany appears to have picked up sharply in
the second quarter following the slowdown in 1995 and a contraction
of 1-1/2 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter of this year. Much of
the rebound owes to a resurgence in construction activity, which was
depressed by unseasonably cold winter weather, although activity in
manufacturing picked up as well. Both industrial production and
manufacturing orders rose strongly in the second quarter. Some
reports have suggested that the large unexpected decline in the IFO
business climate survey in June resulted from statistical anomalies
and does not give an accurate reading of current business sentiment.

IV-14
Unemployment, while still high, has levelled out at just above 3.9
million workers (s.a.), and the all-German unemployment rate ticked
down in July to 10.2 percent. Price pressures remain modest, with
producer prices down over the past 12 months.

The 1997 draft federal budget was approved by Chancellor
Kohl's cabinet in mid-July. Many of the savings measures
incorporated into the 1997 draft budget stem from the fiscal plan
proposed last April that is currently under consideration by the
German parliament. Measures in the plan have been split into five
different pieces of legislation, two of which require the explicit
approval of the Bundesrat (the lower house of the German
parliament). With the draft budget, the savings measures, very low
wage increases for public sector employees, and some spending
reductions at the state and local level, the German Finance Ministry
hopes to move the deficit of the consolidated general government
sector below the Maastricht reference value of 3 percent of GDP in
1997.
In France, monthly indicators suggest that economic activity
contracted in the second quarter. Although industrial production
rose slightly in May, the April-May average was about 1/2 percent

IV-15
below the first-quarter level. Although real consumption of
manufactured products rose in June, the second-quarter average still
was below that in the first quarter. Consumer confidence in June
and July stabilized near the low level registered last December.
Weakness in consumer confidence was matched by a rise in June
unemployment to match the all-time high of March 1994. According to
INSEE, business sentiment in July remained soft as contemporaneous
production conditions ticked down, owing to high inventory levels
and expectations about future production dropped further. Consumer
prices fell in June and July due to lower prices for food and
energy.

In the United Kingdom, preliminary estimates indicate that
real GDP rose 2 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. Although
incoming second-quarter data for the consumer and manufacturing
sectors continue to be somewhat mixed, they are generally positive
on balance. Retail sales rose in June at the most rapid monthly
pace since early 1994, while industrial output fell from its
upwardly revised May level. The purchasing managers' index showed
an increase in new orders and a decrease in stocks of finished goods
in July.

Price pressures remain subdued. Headline inflation fell to
2.2 percent in July from 2.3 percent in the second quarter due to
declining housing costs. A large drop in commodity prices reduced
June producer input prices noticeably. Nevertheless, targeted
inflation (measured as the change from a year earlier in retail
prices excluding mortgage interest payments) has fallen only
slightly.
In Italy, final data indicate that real GDP rose 2 percent
(SAAR) in the first quarter, following a sharp contraction in the
final quarter of 1995. In the first quarter, private consumption
remained sluggish and business fixed investment declined.
Inventories accounted for about one-fourth of the increase in GDP.
A sizable positive contribution from net exports was due in large
part to a sharp drop in imports of raw materials and intermediate
goods. Most available indicators point to a contraction in real
economic activity in the second quarter. Industrial production was
down in April and May on average from its level in the first
quarter, and business sentiment dropped further in the second
quarter. In addition, unemployment rose and machine tool orders were
down sharply in the second quarter compared with the same period a
year ago.

In July, the CPI declined on a month-on-month basis for the
first time in 28 years. Although this decline owed in large part to
a one-time reduction in electricity tariffs, further progress on
consumer price inflation is likely in light of recent moderation in
wholesale and producer price inflation.

On July 17, the parliament approved the 1997-1999 budget
planning document, which outlines the government's macroeconomic
targets for the next three years. Even if the announced objectives
are realized, Italy's deficit will improve to 4.4 percent of GDP,
falling short of the Maastricht Treaty reference value of 3 percent

IV-18
in 1997. Nonetheless, government officials have indicated that
additional fiscal measures might be taken, especially if real
economic activity picks up in the second half of next year. On
August 2, Prime Minister Romano Prodi won a confidence vote on his
supplemental mini-budget. The $10.5 billion measure aims to limit
Italy's budget deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 1996.
Incoming data for Canada are mixed, but on balance suggest
that economic growth continued at a modest pace in the second
quarter. Industrial production and manufacturing shipments and
orders picked up in April and May, in part reflecting a rebound in
economic activity following the end of the GM strike in March. Both
consumer and business sentiment improved in the second quarter,
although retail sales were flat for four consecutive months through
May. Housing starts rose in June, but fell back in July.
Employment declined in both May and June before ticking up in July.
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate remains near its highest level
in more than one year.
Consumer-price inflation remains subdued and has been in the
lower half of the Bank of Canada's target band of 1 to 3 percent
since last December.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
The economies of Argentina and Mexico appear to have continued
to recover from their low points in 1995, but measures of economic
activity in Brazil remain mixed, and the Russian economy has
continued to decline. Inflation declined in Mexico, Venezuela, and
Russia in recent months, but picked up somewhat in Brazil. In the
major Asian developing economies, economic growth is proceeding at a
moderate pace, with only Korea showing evidence of some increase in
inflationary pressures. Mexico has continued to run trade
surpluses, while Brazil has substantially reduced its trade deficit
and Taiwan's trade surplus is up sharply. By contrast, Korea's
current account deficit has widened to historic highs, and China's
large trade surplus has declined to near balance. In July, the IMF
approved a $1.4 billion 12-month stand-by arrangement for Venezuela
to support reduction of the fiscal deficit and the rate of
inflation.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, monthly indicators
suggest that recovery continued in the second quarter following the
estimated 2.2 percent increase in real GDP in the first quarter (SA,
not annual rate). May industrial production (SA) was up about 3
percent from its April level. The urban unemployment rate (NSA)
declined from an average of 6.2 percent in the first quarter to 5.6
percent in the second quarter. Imports also grew substantially in
the second quarter, but strong export growth has kept Mexico's trade
surpluses from declining.
Monthly inflation fell from a recent peak of 2.8 percent in
April to 1.4 percent in July. The decline reflects seasonal factors
and the relative stability of the exchange rate, both of which are
expected to keep inflationary pressures subdued in the coming
months.
On July 25, Mexico announced that, based on higher than
expected demand for a five-year syndicated commercial bank loan
paying LIBOR plus 200 basis points, it would prepay $7 billion of
its $10.5 billion debt to the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund
(ESF): the repayment took effect on August 5. The syndicated bank
loan will be supported by a portion of Mexico's oil export revenues
that currently provide greater assurance of repayment of ESF

credits. The loan originally was announced on June 19 as being for
$3 billion, which Mexico had intended to use, along with additional
funds previously raised in international capital markets, to prepay
$4.7 billion in medium-term swaps from the ESF. Due to high demand,
the size of the loan was increased to $6 billion, permitting a
larger repayment to the ESF, along with a repayment of $1 billion to
the International Monetary Fund.
In Argentina, there is continued evidence that the economy is
recovering. June industrial production (SA) showed an increase of
1.7 percent compared with a year earlier, although it fell 4.7
percent from May. In part because the recovery has been slower than
expected, unemployment increased slightly in May to 17.1 percent
from 16.4 percent in October 1995. Notwithstanding higher economic
activity, inflation has remained low, with July consumer prices 0.1
percent above their year-earlier level, and the trade surplus rose
in the second quarter. International reserves less gold and
securities have reached new highs since last year's drain and were
$14.4 billion at end-July, about unchanged from their level at the
end of 1995.
Argentina's $2.5 billion fiscal deficit in the first half of
this year was $1 billion over the target agreed with the IMF, in
part reflecting the slow pace of economic recovery and congressional
delays on the approval of the privatization of nuclear plants and
the hydroelectric dam, Yacyreta. To reduce the deficit, the
government announced a series of public payroll reduction measures

that will save an estimated $2 billion per year. These measures
were not well received by Argentines, and the largest union
federation, the CGT, led a general strike on August 8th.
Increasing political pressures over the fiscal adjustment
measures renewed frictions between President Menem and Finance
Minister Cavallo, culminating in Menem's ouster of Cavallo on July
26. Roque Fernandez, formerly the President of the Central Bank,
replaced Cavallo as Finance Minister on July 29. The new Central
Bank President, Pedro Pou, was previously vice president of the
Central Bank. Financial market reaction to Cavallo's departure,
following a short initial period of instability, subsequently was
calm in Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America as Fernandez vowed
to continue with current economic policy and renegotiate targets
with the IMF.
In spite of public dissatisfaction with fiscal tightening, on
August 12, the government announced a wide-ranging set of tax
increases that will more than offset a reduction in the general
value-added tax from 21 percent to 20 percent. The government
estimates that the new package, on balance, will yield $1.2 billion
in 1996 and $4 billion in 1997.
In Brazil, industrial production (SA) has been essentially
flat so far this year, indicating that the economy has yet to resume
strong growth. Inflation picked up slightly in the last couple of
months, but has remained low by Brazilian standards. The cumulative
trade deficit for January to June was $0.3 billion, compared with a
$4.3 billion deficit a year earlier. International reserves at the
end of June totalled $60 billion (liquidity concept), up

IV-25
considerably from $31.5 billion a year ago, despite a payment of
nearly $1.4 billion to the Paris Club at the end of June. However,
Brazil had $263 million in net foreign capital outflows in June,
against inflows of $345 million in May.

Brazil's efforts to accelerate its fiscal reforms have
stagnated. The Brazilian Congress gave a first-round approval to a
new 0.2 percent temporary tax on financial transactions. However,
it is not expected that this tax will have much of a fiscal impact.
In addition, Brazil's lower house of Congress approved, in a second
round vote, a watered-down version of the pension reform bill that
has been stuck in the Congress for over a year. The bill is
scheduled to be voted on by the Senate soon.
On July 1, Brazil's central bank lowered reserve requirements
on bank deposits from 83 to 75 percent in order to free up funds for
agriculture and spur a gradual decline of loan interest rates.
Between August and December, the requirement will be lowered by 1
percent a month, and in January it will be dropped 3 percent.
The growing weakness of Brazil's banking system was
underscored by the July 29 announcement that the federally owned
Banco do Brazil, Latin America's largest bank, posted a loss of $7.8
billion for the first half of 1996, one of the worst in the region's
corporate history. The size of the loss reflected an unprecedented
bid to address bad debt accumulated over years of political
meddling. On August 7, the government announced steps to
restructure the state-owned banks, including acquisition of banks
from respective state governments, support for liquidation or

IV-26
privatization, and partial financing to clean up bank balance
sheets.
In Venezuela, consumer price inflation, while still very high,
has fallen in the wake of the stabilization program announced in
April and the July agreement on a stand-by arrangement with the IMF.
The non-oil trade deficit increased in May. Total reserves less
gold have increased in recent months to $8.4 billion at the end of
July, about five months of imports.

The IMF's Executive Board approved a $1.4 billion equivalent
12-month stand-by loan for Venezuela on July 12. The principal
program objectives are (1) a reduction of Venezuela's overall fiscal
deficit from 8.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1.7 percent of GDP this
year and 0.5 percent in 1997, and (2) a reduction of inflation to
1.5 percent per month by the end of 1996. The exchange rate, which
was allowed to float on April 22, has remained around 470 bolivars
per dollar. On July 8, the Central Bank announced a system of a
gradually depreciating exchange rate band as an anti-inflationary
device. The initial central parity was set at Bs.470 per dollar
with a 7.5 percent band on either side. The band will be adjusted
in line with a 1.5 percent per month targeted inflation rate for the
last quarter of 1996.
In China in the first half of 1996, real GDP growth and
inflation remained relatively steady, trade was roughly balanced,
and capital inflows continued strongly. Real GDP rose 9.8 percent
from the year-earlier period, and consumer prices in July were 8.3
percent higher than a year earlier. China's small trade surplus of

IV-27
$2.0 billion in the first seven months of 1996 compares with a
surplus of $14.3 billion in the year-earlier period. The value of
exports fell 7 percent, reflecting the elimination of certain export
subsidies at the beginning of this year and the real appreciation of
China's currency against the yen, while the value of imports rose 10
percent. Net inflows of foreign direct investment were $20 billion
in the first half of 1996, compared with inflows of $16 billion in
the year-earlier period. Foreign exchange reserves reached $87
billion at the end of June, up $13 billion from the end of 1995.

In Taiwan, industrial production appears weak while inflation
has slowed. Industrial production fell 0.5 percent in the second
quarter from the year-earlier period, while consumer prices were 1.4
percent higher in July from a year earlier. The trade balance in
the first seven months of 1996 was $7.1 billion, up from $2.5
billion in the year-earlier period. The value of exports rose 4
percent, while the value of imports fell 3 percent. Following
Chinese missile tests, Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves fell to a
recent low of $83 billion in March. Reserves have stabilized since
then, however, standing at $86 billion at the end of June.

In Korea, economic activity appears to have expanded at a
moderate pace by historical standards during the second quarter,
although industrial production in June was particularly weak due to
serious labor disruptions. Korea's current account deficit widened
to a historic high of $9 billion during the first half of this year,
as exports continued to decelerate markedly following rapid growth
through most of last year. The pronounced slowing in export growth
during 1996 has reflected a considerable appreciation of the won
against the yen and falling prices for Korea's major electronics
exports. Korea has allowed its exchange rate to depreciate by
around 5 percent against the dollar since late-April in order to
improve its external competitiveness. Inflation has picked up
somewhat in recent months, as prices rose by 5.6 percent in July
from their year-earlier level, compared with a 3.8 percent increase
over a comparable period in July 1995.

In Russia, Boris Yeltsin coasted to a surprisingly easy
victory over Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov in the final round
of the Presidential election on July 3. On August 12, parliament
approved Yeltsin's nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin to continue as
Prime Minister. Despite the favorable election results, concerns
about Yeltsin's health have been a source of political uncertainty
in recent weeks.
Monthly inflation has continued to decline, registering only 1
percent in both June and July. The ruble has depreciated slowly
against the dollar in recent months, remaining comfortably within
the announced band. Measures of economic activity indicate that the
economy continued to contract during the first seven months of the
year. Russian authorities have linked this decline to weak

IV-29
investment due to political uncertainty in the run-up to the
election.
Russia has failed to satisfy some of the conditions of its IMF
Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Gross international reserves, net
domestic assets of the monetary authorities, and central bank credit
to the consolidated government all breached end-June targets by
small margins. The fiscal deficit during the first half of 1996 was
equal to 5.7 percent of GDP, just below the EFF ceiling, but real
tax revenues were substantially below the program's floor. Due to
these difficulties, the IMF postponed an EFF disbursement of $340
million scheduled for July. In response, the Russian government has
agreed to implement a number of policy measures, including strong
action to increase tax revenues through stricter enforcement.
