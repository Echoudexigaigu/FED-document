DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The available economic indicators point, on balance, to a
considerable slowing in the pace of GDP growth this quarter.
Employment growth is far from weak, however, and the resultant
pressure on labor supplies is evident in continuing acceleration of
wage rates. Even so, the August price indexes showed inflation to
be still quite subdued.
Labor Markets
The labor market reports revealed slower growth in aggregate
hours of private production workers during July and August than
during the first half of the year. Nonetheless, labor demand has
remained sufficiently strong to generate a further decline in the
unemployment rate.
The average gain in private payrolls slipped to 180,000 per
month in July and August, compared with the first-half pace of
220,000. Increases in the financial and real estate industries and
in business services, including help-supply firms, remained
relatively strong in the past two months, but hiring at health and
hotel facilities and at retail establishments was unusually slow in
August. Construction employment also slowed noticeably in August,
posting growth of just 6,000. Manufacturing employment changed
little, on net, in recent months after the fluctuations associated
with seasonal shutdowns in the motor vehicle industry are taken into
account. During July and August, the only notable gains occurred in
motor vehicles and the related fabricated metals and rubber
industries; those gains were offset by further declines in the
apparel industry.
With the average workweek so far in the third quarter about in
line with the average for the first half of the year, the recent
slowing of private employment growth has been reflected in a
deceleration in aggregate hours of private production or
nonsupervisory workers. Aggregate hours in July and August averaged
1.4 percent above the second-quarter average (annual rate).
Assuming a further moderate increase in September, the quarterly
rise could be closer to 2 percent, still a noticeably lower rate of
increase than the 2.7 percent over the first half of the year.
In contrast to the private sector, employment gains in the
public sector have been surprisingly robust so far in the third
quarter, boosted by sizable increases at state and local

governments. Two special factors contributed to these increases and
suggest that much of the rise will be reversed in September. First,
the bulk of the gain (100,000 over the July-August period) occurred
in local education, where the trends toward earlier school openings
and year-round schools apparently have not yet been completely
incorporated into the seasonal adjustment factors; in both 1994 and
1995, for example, large advances in August were followed by dips in
September. Second, this year's local summer jobs programs extended
into the August survey reference week and, thus, may have boosted
local noneducation employment.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate dropped
0.3 percentage point in August to 5.1 percent, moving it below the
5.3 percent to 5.6 percent range that had prevailed since early this
year. Several considerations caution against a literal reading of
this drop. First, the fall in the unemployment rate was
particularly dramatic for workers aged 20 to 24 years and for those
more than 54 years, groups that have traditionally had more variable
unemployment rates. In addition, this August's later-than-usual
survey reference week may have overstated the decline in
joblessness. The unemployment rate for adults aged 25 to 54
years--which has shown less variability over this year--also fell in
August, but by only 0.1 percentage point. The decline since May in
the rate for this group, which probably is more indicative of the
underlying trend in labor market conditions, has been 0.3 percentage
point, compared with 0.5 percentage point for the overall labor
force.
Other recent indicators support the picture of a still
relatively strong labor market. Initial claims for unemployment
insurance remained low into early September. The four-week moving
average for the period ending September 7 was 328,000, compared with
359,000 for the same period last year. Moreover, expectations of
labor market conditions, as measured by the Michigan Survey Research
Center and Conference Board surveys of households and by the
1. The seasonal adjustment procedures for the Current Population
Survey, unlike those for the establishment survey, do not account
for the timing of the survey reference week. The BLS suggests that,
because the survey week fell in the third week of August, many
students who otherwise might have been unemployed or employed may
have already left the labor force either to go on vacation or return
to school. This hypothesis is consistent with the sharp drop in the
labor force among men aged 16 to 24. However, a puzzling aspect of
the story is why the labor force of student-aged women was
essentially unchanged.

Manpower survey of businesses, improved or held steady at quite
favorable levels in recent months.
Revised figures on productivity and costs now show that the
strong gains in hours worked during the first half of this year were
accompanied by some recovery in labor productivity. Taking into
account BEA's revised estimates of output, productivity in the
nonfarm business sector rose more in the second quarter than
originally estimated, bringing the average growth rate for the first
half of the year to 1.2 percent at an annual rate, up from last
year's dismal 0.3 percent rate. BEA's revised estimates also show
that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a
3-1/2 percent annual rate over the first half of the year. This
measure of the change in hourly compensation, while down slightly
from its 1995 pace, continues to run ahead of the rate of increase
in ECI compensation. The latest four-quarter change in nonfarm
hourly compensation was 3.8 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for
the ECI.
The only current-quarter indicator of labor costs since last
Greenbook is the August reading on average hourly earnings of
production workers. The twelve-month change in this wage measure
has now moved up to 3-1/2 percent--from 3 percent for the twelve
months ending August 1995.
Industrial Production
After a pause in July, industrial production rose 0.5 percent
2in August, similar to its pace over the first half of the year.
Increases in August were widespread across manufacturing industries
and were somewhat tempered by a drop in the output of motor vehicles
and parts from its high July level. In addition, utilities
generation surged, retracing part of the large weather-related
declines earlier in the summer; mining activity also advanced
solidly with gains in coal output and drilling activity.
Output of motor vehicles and parts dropped 2.1 percent last
month after two months of solid gains. Outside the motor vehicle
sector, manufacturing production rose 0.4 percent last month.
Increases in the output of business equipment remained an important
area of strength marked by continued robust growth in office and
computing equipment, an uptick in industrial equipment, and an
increase in defense and space equipment. Since the end of last
2. Growth of industrial production in May was revised up to
0.7 percent; the growth rates for June and July were unchanged.

year, output of defense and space equipment has posted its first
sustained rise since the 1980s. In contrast, the output of
manufactured consumer goods other than motor vehicles fell last
month as appliance production dropped substantially for a second
month. The production of construction supplies declined as well,
perhaps the result of some softening of building activity, while
materials output advanced, with gains in both durable and nondurable
materials.
Other indicators of manufacturing activity also point to a
solid pace of industrial activity. The purchasing managers' indexes
of new orders and production turned up in August and stand at levels
consistent with an appreciable expansion of the manufacturing sector
in the near term. Real adjusted new orders for durable goods
increased markedly in July, on the heels of three consecutive
monthly increases.
The factory operating rate was 82.3 percent in August. Both
the utilization rate in primary processing industries and the rate
in advanced processing industries continue to be in the upper end of
the range observed this year. These relatively high operating rates
have been associated with a modest tendency toward deteriorating
vendor performance, as reported by purchasing managers.
Motor Vehicles
The United Auto Workers (UAW) reached a tentative three-year
agreement with Ford this week; the vote by the UAW members will be
completed by September 29. The highlights of the pact include
Ford's concession to keep at least 95 percent of the skilled and
unskilled UAW members at each of its forty-nine assembly and parts
plants in the United States. While wage increases for current
workers include a combination of lump-sum payments and annual
increases, the UAW agreed to accept a permanently lower entry wage
for new hires at parts facilities.
While negotiations are under way with both Chrysler and General
Motors, the UAW may focus on Chrysler next because that firm is
likely to have fewer problems with this tentative agreement than GM,
for whom the guaranteed employment provision poses a major obstacle.
Indications are that GM would not accept a level higher than
85 percent and would prefer an even lower level. If negotiations
between GM and the UAW were to break off and a strike were to occur,
the work stoppage probably would begin late this month or in
October.

II-12
The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) reached a tentative settlement
with Chrysler this week, but this agreement also contains elements
that GM will find difficult to accept, raising the likelihodd of a
CAW strike against GM later this month. The potential effects on
domestic production of a CAW strike against GM are quite serious.
According to GM, some domestic production would be shut down because
of parts shortages if the strike were to last more than one week,
and, after three weeks, all of GM's assembly plants would be shut
down. If strike disruptions were to prove lengthy, and underlying
demand did not weaken noticeably, the catch-up in production likely
would extend into next year. The effects of a strike on domestic
sales would not be so immediate because overall inventories were
near normal levels heading into the strike.
The industry has been experiencing strong demand, with sales of
new light vehicles in July and August averaging about 15 million
units at an annual rate after adjusting for shifts in the reporting
periods by some firms. This pace is just a bit below the average
sales rate in the first six months of the year. The ongoing
strength in sales has been supported by consumers' relatively
favorable appraisals of buying conditions for new vehicles, as
revealed in the Michigan SRC survey (chart). In addition, J.D.
Powers estimates that incentives in the current quarter, while down
noticeably from earlier this year, remain at a relatively high
level. At the same time, price changes have been moderate, although
finance rates have moved up recently.
The monthly changes in sales this year have been quite
volatile, and the results for recent months continue this pattern,
falling in July and then rebounding sharply in August. Part of this
swing reflects movements in GM's sales of autos to fleets. New cars
make up about 75 percent of GM's total fleet sales (chart). The
company began July with inventories on the lean side--at about 60
days--and with most assembly plants closed during the first two
weeks of the month. Consequently, it deferred some fleet sales from
July to August in order to ensure that retail sales were not unduly
crimped by shortages of popular vehicles. GM's fleet sales,
which were at a twelve-month low, rebounded in August. Its retail
3. The overall swing in sales of light vehicles in July and
August may be somewhat exaggerated because the current seasonal

sales, which were flat in July, also moved up in August, but sales
of light trucks more than accounted for the gain.
Automakers continued efforts this summer to rebuild inventories
in the aftermath of the March strike and to meet the surprising
strength in sales. Measured against the average pace of sales in
July and August, days' supply of light vehicles in August is
estimated to have been at about the usual target level of 65 days.
However, days' supply of autos--at about 63 days--was still a little
on the lean side, while days' supply of light trucks was about 70
days. Although the strike will have serious implications for
fourth-quarter assembly plans, the level of the initial production
schedules for the coming quarter--published a few weeks before the
strike--was consistent with sales holding near the 15 million unit
mark for the rest of the year.

Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending slowed noticeably in the middle of the year.
Spending on goods other than motor vehicles dropped sharply in June
and was flat in July, with the weakness fairly widespread; outlays
for services also were little changed, on balance, over this period.
Advance estimates of retail sales in August, however, show a
moderate upturn that suggests that consumer spending may be moving
back to a pace more consistent with the sustained high levels of
consumer confidence, further gains in the value of household assets,
and continued ready access to credit for most potential borrowers.
The sharpest rebounds in nominal retail sales in August
occurred at general merchandisers and apparel stores, which would
seem to bear out the anecdotal reports of relatively strong back-to-
school sales. Moreover, the CPI for apparel fell in August, which

implies a sizable increase in real purchases of clothing and
footwear for the month. Although sales at furniture and appliance
dealers were flat in August, outlays for other durables posted a
sizable gain. However, nominal sales at gasoline stations fell in
August for the third straight month, only partly because of price
declines. Nominal outlays at food stores and at eating and drinking
places were down as well. The retail sales data suggest that real
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for goods excluding motor
vehicles rose about 1/2 percent in August after no gain in July.
This puts the average for July and August slightly below the second-
quarter level.
Growth in real expenditures for services was weak in June and
July. Real outlays for energy services fell in both months,
reflecting the return to more normal weather in June and slightly
cooler than average temperatures in July. For the country as a
whole, temperatures remained on the cool side again in August, which
should hold down spending on energy services. Non-energy services
were little changed in both months, in part because of estimated
lower expenditures on brokerage and investment services as well as
on moving and insurance outlays.5
Real disposable personal income edged down in July after two
sizable monthly gains. Real DPI likely was up appreciably again in
August; the sharp increases in production worker hours and average
hourly earnings last month should translate into a sizable gain in
private wages and salaries. Thus, the personal saving rate could
well jump above the 5 percent mark again this quarter, as it did
during the lull in spending at the end of 1995.
Housing Markets
Evidence of a slowdown in single-family housing activity
continued to accumulate over the summer. Starts of single-family
homes dropped 5-3/4 percent in July; smoothing through the month-to-
month fluctuations, the series has been edging down since April.
4. Based on the advance retail sales data, the staff estimates
that real PCE for goods other than motor vehicles increased
0.3 percent in July. The revised retail sales figures indicate
that, in addition to the downward revision for July, the drop in
real PCE in June was steeper than previously estimated
(-0.7 percent).
5. Although purchases of tickets to Olympic events boosted the
"spectator sport" component of services about $3 billion in July,
the added spending was largely offset by an abrupt $2 billion
decline in outlays for movie tickets--a possible Olympics side
effect.

In contrast to the decline in starts, new home sales jumped
8 percent in July. But the rise was accompanied by large downward
revisions to the April and May estimates as well as a small
reduction in the reading for June. The history of large revisions
to preliminary estimates of new home sales suggests that little
weight should be given to the July reading.6 Of greater
significance in the report on new home sales is the downward
revision of sales in 1996:Q2, which now shows a slight decrease from
the first quarter. This declining pattern is confirmed by the
trajectory of existing home sales, which decreased in June and July.
Sales of existing homes tend to lag other indicators of single-
family activity because a substantial share are recorded at the
closing, while new home sales are recorded mainly at the time a
sales contract is signed.
More recent indicators suggest that, on the whole, sales of
single family homes continued to soften late in the third quarter.
A survey of builders showed that their assessments of new home sales
continued to weaken a bit in August and September. Over the same
period, homebuying attitudes, as measured by the Michigan survey,
eroded further. However, applications for mortgages to purchase
homes remained flat through early September at the relatively high
level that has prevailed so far this year. Taken together, this
evidence points to a modest slippage in the production and sales of
single-family homes in recent months.
Multifamily housing starts jumped to 322,000 units (annual
rate) in July, almost offsetting a decline in June. Building
permits for multifamily housing, which also have had a zigzag
pattern so far this year, surged to the highest level since early
1990. There are some indications that apartment construction at the
national level may be outpacing the growth of demand. In
particular, the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units was higher
in the second quarter, compared with the year-earlier level, marking
the third consecutive quarter in which vacancies have risen.
Moreover, real residential rents, as measured in the CPI, continued
6. The large revisions resulted mainly from the difficulty of
estimating sales of houses that are sold before issuance of a
building permit and therefore are not detected immediately by the
sampling of permits conducted by the Census Bureau. In the past
three and one-half years, homes that were sold before the start of
construction accounted for more than half of the revisions to the
series but constituted only about one-third of total new home sales.

to edge down in the second quarter and were about flat in July and
August.
Business Fixed Investment
Early indications for the current quarter suggest that real PDE
will advance substantially faster than the 6 percent pace registered
in the second quarter. New orders for nondefense capital goods
rebounded in July after a decline in the second quarter. The
biggest spurt was in orders for communication equipment, which rose
16 percent in July after an increase of 7-1/2 percent in June.
Industry contacts report that the expanding array of services being
offered over phone lines--call waiting, caller ID, voice
mailboxes--require new software and upgrades to switching equipment,
providing an ongoing boost to this component of PDE. In
addition, real spending on office and computing equipment has
maintained substantial momentum. After adjusting for the continuing
large price decreases in this sector, orders and shipments posted
further gains in July. Elsewhere, orders for other capital goods
have increased for three consecutive months, although they appear to
have decelerated from the rapid pace of the past few years.
Spending on transportation equipment eased a bit in July and
August from the second-quarter level. Sales of heavy trucks were
flat in July, after a sharp drop in June. Fleet sales of light
vehicles were off in July but appear to have snapped back in August.
Boeing continued to build on its already large backlog of orders for
commercial aircraft, but a major retooling effort and strained labor
relations have hindered their ability to achieve planned increases
in production.
BEA reported that real expenditures on nonresidential
structures dipped slightly in the second quarter. Subsequent
downward revisions to data on construction put-in-place point to a
somewhat larger decline, at about a 2 percent annual rate.
Construction in July was a near mirror image of June: all
categories of buildings posted gains in June but fell back the
subsequent month, while public utilities declined in June but
bounced up in July. On balance, the declines in July retraced only
7. On August 8, the FCC announced new rules implementing the
Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996. The act opens the local
phone monopolies to competition and will have widespread effects in
the telecommunications industry, including, perhaps, a substantial
increase in equipment investment. However, the effects these
changes most likely will not begin to be felt until sometime next
year at the earliest.

part of the June rise but left the nominal level of spending below
the second-quarter average. These recent data--although only
preliminary figures--could mark the beginning of a slowdown in
nonresidential construction that has been suggested for some months
by the drop in construction contracts. However, other market
indicators have been generally upbeat; for example, the commercial
vacancy rate reported by Coldwell Banker continued to decline in the
second quarter, and property values appear to be stable.
Business Inventories
With a relatively small net change over the second quarter,
businesses in manufacturing and trade (excluding automotive dealers
and distributors) still faced low inventory-sales ratios around
midyear. Incoming data for July showed a sharp pickup in inventory
investment, mainly at retail trade establishments.
Manufacturers' inventories turned up at an $8 billion annual
rate in July (book-value), after declining from March through June.
The July accumulation was notable because it was predominantly in
stocks of materials and supplies; inventories of finished goods were
reduced further, while work-in-process stocks were about unchanged.

production plans, especially in capital goods industries. By market
grouping, the July buildup was concentrated in stocks of producers'
durable equipment (table above) and coincided with strong gains in
equipment orders. Data at more disaggregated levels show that the
accumulation of PDE stocks in July was distributed fairly evenly
among all major categories--information, industrial, and
transportation equipment. In contrast, manufacturers' inventories
of non-auto consumer goods continued to decline. For many
manufacturing industries, inventory-shipments ratios edged down
further in July from levels already low by historical standards.
In the trade sector, wholesale inventories posted only a modest
net increase in July. held down by a substantial decline in stocks
of farm products. Part of the decline in stocks of farm products
may have resulted from declines in grain prices in June and July--
especially prices of wheat and corn. Excluding farm products,
wholesale inventories expanded at an $18 billion annual rate in
July, considerably above the average pace of $7 billion over the
second quarter. A pickup in inventory investment was also evident
in retailing. Non-auto retail inventories expanded at a $25 billion
annual rate in July, more than five times the pace over the second
quarter. Although inventory-sales ratios for most retail categories
turned up in July, they remained relatively low by historical
standards. For retail GAF stores, where consumer spending is
considered largely discretionary, the inventory-sales ratio in July
was still near the low end of the range of recent years. On
balance, as of July, most types of trade establishments appeared
positioned for further restocking.
Federal Government
The incoming news on the unified budget continues to be quite
favorable. For the first ten months of fiscal year 1996, the
deficit (adjusted for payment shifts, deposit insurance, and
spectrum auction proceeds) came to $117 billion, $52 billion less
than in the comparable period a year ago. In part, the shrinkage of
the deficit has reflected solid growth in receipts: Both individual
and corporate income taxes have risen substantially above year-
earlier levels. In addition, adjusted outlays have increased only
2-1/2 percent so far this fiscal year, in part because of reductions
in discretionary appropriations. As for fiscal 1996 as a whole, the
CBO's mid-August estimate was for a deficit of $116 billion,
essentially the same as the estimate released by OMB in July.

In contrast, the NIPA data for the first half of 1996 show
surprisingly robust growth in real federal consumption and
investment expenditures. BEA now estimates that real defense
spending rose at an annual rate of 6 percent in the first quarter
and 10-1/2 percent in the second quarter; this growth is largely
explained by a bulge in aircraft deliveries in the first half and
the fact that the recorded spending increases were from a below-
trend fourth-quarter level. In addition, as was noted in the August
Greenbook with reference to the advance figures, NIPA estimates for
nondefense expenditures seem strong relative to the trends in
unified budget accounts.
The Congress reconvened after Labor Day and is expected to stay
in session about one month. The primary order of business has been
fiscal 1997 appropriations. As of September 17, the President had
signed appropriations for the District of Columbia, Agriculture, the
legislative branch, and military construction. For the remaining
nine appropriations bills, press reports suggest that the President
is advocating about $4-1/2 billion more funding for domestic
programs, and about $3 billion less for defense, than the Congress
has indicated a willingness to accept. These differences are
unlikely to be resolved in time to enact all appropriations bills
before the beginning of fiscal 1997; hence, several appropriations
bills will probably be rolled into either a full-year omnibus
appropriations bill or a continuing resolution lasting at least six
months. In the latter case, funding for the affected programs will
likely be set in accordance with fiscal 1996 levels.
Finally, although federal regulations are still to be written,
action on welfare reform has largely shifted to the states, which
must submit their plans for reform to the federal government by
July 1, 1997. The federal legislation sets out an ambitious
timetable for moving welfare recipients into the labor market--
indeed, a state will not receive its full federal grant unless
25 percent of the participants in its federally funded welfare
program are engaged in "work-related activities" in fiscal 1997, and
the percentage rises incrementally to 50 percent by fiscal 2002.
However, the states have considerable discretion in designing their
8. BEA's quarterly estimates of nondefense purchases rely on
various unpublished indicators of government spending. BEA will do
a full reconciliation of its nondefense purchases figures, and other
components of federal expenditures, with the final fiscal 1996
budget data when they are available. Revised NIPA data will be
published with BEA's 1997 annual revision.

II-30
programs, and assessing how the reforms will affect the labor market
and other economic variables is extremely difficult until more is
known about how the new state programs will be shaped. Key
uncertainties include how the states will define work-related
activities and which individuals they will require to engage in such
activities; adding to the uncertainty is the possibility that some
of the more stringent features of the law will be reexamined by the
next Congress.
State and Local Governments
Indicators of spending in the third quarter by state and local
governments are mixed. As mentioned earlier, employment gains have
been sizable in recent months. However, because much of the
increase reflects the timing of school openings and of summer jobs
programs, the apparent strength is likely to prove temporary.
Otherwise, employment appears to have been trending up gradually
over the past year or so. Real outlays for construction fell in
July for the third consecutive month. Much of the weakness in the
past three months was in the building of educational facilities and
sewer systems. Overall, construction in the first seven months of
this year about matches the average for 1995 as a whole. However,
the fundamentals suggest that this lull will be temporary: State
and local revenues have been quite strong of late, and
infrastructure needs abound, particularly in education, as the
population of school-age children is expected to continue to rise
for another decade.
On the revenue side, strong growth in receipts in recent years
has buoyed fiscal positions. According to the Center for the Study
of the States, the states enjoyed robust gains in tax revenue in the
second quarter of this year, when high final payments and strong
estimated taxes boosted personal income receipts. Sales tax growth
also was quite strong in the second quarter.
Prices
The incoming data on inflation at the retail level have
continued to be quite favorable. Both the overall CPI and the CPI
excluding food and energy edged up only 0.1 percent in August after
rising 0.3 percent in July. Over the twelve months ended in August,
the overall CPI increased 2.9 percent, up from the 2.6 percent pace
over the preceding twelve months. Excluding food and energy,
however, prices have risen 2.6 percent in the past year, down from
the 2.9 percent increase in the year-earlier period. In contrast to

II-31
the first half of this year, when both food and energy prices were
contributing to inflation, rising food prices have been roughly
offset by falling energy prices over the past few months.
In August, retail energy prices fell 0.6 percent, the third
consecutive monthly decline. The price of gasoline continued to
drop at the retail level, reflecting the earlier declines in crude
oil prices, but fuel oil prices turned up in August following three
months of large declines. Utility rates were mixed: Electricity
prices rose further, while natural gas prices were flat. The
initial run-up in crude oil prices, a result of the delay in Iraq's
limited oil sale, was reflected in producer prices for gasoline in
August. The conflict with Iraq in early September and subsequent
suspension of its oil sale has driven up crude oil prices
considerably further.
Retail food prices moved up 0.4 percent in August, about the
same as the average increase over the past six months. High grain
prices continued to boost prices for dairy products, beef, pork, and
poultry. The index for dairy products jumped 2.0 percent last
month, while the prices of beef, pork, and chicken advanced
1.7 percent, 2.1 percent, and 1.2 percent respectively. The index
for cereals and bakery products was flat in August, as lower cereal
prices offset price increases for flour and other bakery products.
Over the past six months, cereal prices have dropped about 8 percent
at an annual rate; however, large increases in the other components
of the cereals and bakery products index have more than offset this
decline in cereal prices.
The index for commodities other than food and energy edged down
0.1 percent in August after essentially no change in each of the
preceeding three months. Apparel prices dropped 1.5 percent on a
seasonally adjusted basis, reflecting retailers' decisions both to
delay the introduction of higher-priced fall clothing and to offer
large discounts on spring and summer clothing. Apart from apparel,
the prices of other commodities excluding food and energy were
unchanged in August. Among other commodities, used car prices were
flat in August following four months of declines; over the past six
months, used car prices have dropped at a 5 percent annual rate,
offsetting a pickup of similar magnitude over the preceding six-
month period.

The CPI for services other than energy was up 0.2 percent in
August following increases of 0.3 percent in each of the four
preceding months. Rent of shelter rose 0.3 percent, in line with
its average monthly increase over the past year, while the price of
services excluding energy and shelter rose 0.2 percent, down
slightly from its recent monthly increases. Among the components of
non-energy, non-shelter services, the index for medical services
rose 0.2 percent in August; over the past twelve months the index
has increased 3-1/2 percent, compared with roughly 5 percent in each
of the two preceding years. In August, airfares fell slightly;
although the reintroduction of a 10 percent federal tax on airfares
affected some fares, those increases were more than offset by heavy
price discounting on other fares. In contrast, auto finance charges
moved up 1.8 percent last month, apparently reflecting less generous
auto incentives this year relative to the normal seasonal pattern;
over the past three months, auto finance charges have jumped nearly
17 percent at an annual rate, up from a 2 percent increase in the

previous three months (when loan rates were lagging the rise in
market yields).
After declining over much of this year, industrial materials
prices have risen in recent weeks. The Journal of Commerce
industrial materials index has risen 1.5 percent since mid-August
but remains just below the level recorded at the end of last year.
Metals prices are down slightly, on balance, since mid-August.
However, the prices of lumber and plywood have surged in recent
weeks. The PPI for crude materials less food and energy edged
up in August but remains 6-1/4 percent below its level last
December.
Changes in indicators of consumers' inflation expectations have
been mixed since July. Mean expected inflation over the next twelve
months fell to 3.9 percent in the preliminary September Michigan
Survey of consumers; median expected inflation, a less volatile
series, edged up to 3.3 percent. Expectations for inflation for the
next five to ten years, as measured by the median response, remained
in the range of other readings this year, at 3.1 percent.
Agriculture
Because much of the uncertainty about production is behind us,
agricultural markets have been less volatile in recent weeks than
earlier in the summer. The USDA's most recent crop production
estimates showed little change from previous published numbers.
Corn production is projected to be about 19 percent above last
year's level, and soybean production is expected rise 5 percent.
With the harvest of this year's spring wheat crop mostly completed,
total wheat production this year is projected to be up about
5 percent. The cattle herd has continued to decline: The number of
cattle on feed as of August 1 was 14 percent below the level at the
same point last year. On the other hand, poultry production for the
9. Since the last Greenbook, lumber and plywood prices have
increased sharply. As of early September, the plywood price nearly
equaled its 1995 high, and the lumber price was only moderately
below its peak in early 1994. These prices have responded to
unexpectedly high demand owing to the continued strength of housing
construction. The supply of wood products has been limited by
environmental protections that have constrained production in some
areas of the United States. Also, inventory positions going into
the third quarter were unusually low because of uncertainty about
pricing of wood products imported from Canada; quotas on Canadian
products result in taxes if specified limits are exceeded.
Hurricane Fran may have played a small role but is not mentioned by
market analysts as a significant factor in the recent rise in
prices.

II-38
seven months ended in July--the most recent reliable production
estimate--showed a 7 percent increase from the the same period a
year ago.
Prices for crops traded in futures markets have been mixed.
Prices of corn and wheat have dropped about 10 percent on most
futures contracts for delivery of this year's crop. On the other
hand, the price of soybeans has edged up a bit in recent weeks,
owing mostly to concerns about the weather across the Midwest in
late August. Cash prices for crops have moved in the same direction
as futures prices. However, the cash price of corn has dropped much
more than futures prices--about 35 percent--since mid-August,
perhaps reflecting earlier delivery of some corn grown in the
Southeast, as farmers took advantage of high prices on the cash
market in advance of this year's harvest in the corn belt. Prices
for cattle have moved up further on both cash and futures markets,
and hog prices have dropped back some.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The decision at the August FOMC meeting to keep reserve
conditions unchanged had little impact on financial market prices.
However, interest rates have been volatile over the intermeeting
period, responding sharply at times on the release of data
suggesting greater or lesser growth and inflationary pressure.
Reports of the attitudes of Federal Reserve officials also
precipitated significant market moves on occasion, with a reported
leak of discount rate proposals causing rates to rise yesterday.
All told, on net, short-term yields have risen around 15 basis
points over the intermeeting period, and long-term rates are up
20 to 25 basis points.
Despite the higher rates, stock prices rose over the
intermeeting period, with the blue chip indexes up about 3 percent
or so, establishing new highs (chart). Small-capitalization stocks,
which had fallen particularly sharply in the mid-July selloff, fared
even better, with the NASDAQ composite rising 7 percent. Still,
this index remains around 3-3/4 percent below its previous peaks.
In mid-September the price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 stood at
the high end of its range over the past decade.
Money and credit flows appear to have remained subdued in the
third quarter. Business borrowing from banks and in the securities
markets has been sluggish, apparently because ample internal funds
have damped credit needs. In the household sector, consumer credit
growth has continued at a pace well below that reported earlier in
the year: and while there is only partial data on mortgage credit
growth, in the current quarter signs suggest some slowing. State
and local debt has contracted this quarter, more than offsetting the
small increase in the previous quarter. In contrast, the federal
government has stepped up its borrowing a little in the third
quarter, after taking advantage of unusually large tax inflows to
pay down bills in the second. Growth in the broader monetary
aggregates picked up a bit in August from July's sluggish pace, and
partial data for September point to possibly another pick up this
month.
The slowdown in business borrowing in August occurred even as
supply conditions remained very favorable. Rate spreads on
corporate debt and business loans were quite low, and banks
evidently still were aggressive lenders to firms, likely because

measures of business credit quality remained positive. By contrast,
household credit quality has continued to deteriorate somewhat, and
some survey and anecdotal reports show that banks are raising their
standards for lending to households, particularly for credit cards.
Bank Credit and the Monetary Aggregates
Bank credit contracted in August at an annual rate of
1 percent, extending a period of weakness evident since the spring.
The weakness was concentrated at large banks, where loans fell at a
4 percent rate last month; because of fairly brisk growth at small
banks, however, loans expanded at a 2-1/2 percent pace overall.
Large banks also shed securities at a rapid clip, as they have over
much of this year. Data for the first half of September show only
anemic growth in bank credit.
Business loans grew at a pace of only 2-1/2 percent in August,
even though banks reportedly continued to price such loans
aggressively for large customers. The spread of the C&I loan rate
for large loans over the intended federal funds rate, as reported in
the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending to Business, narrowed somewhat
in August compared with three months earlier and is near record low
levels (chart, top panel). The spread for small and medium-sized
business loans was unchanged, remaining appreciably under the wide
spreads of the early 1990s but above those of the late 1980s.
Growth of real estate loans bounced back in August to a
7-1/4 percent annual growth rate. Some of the increase likely
reflects the relatively large share of new mortgages that carry
adjustable rates, as banks are more likely to keep such mortgages on
their books. By contrast, the growth of consumer loans, at
4 percent, was again held down by securitization. With the addition
of securitized loans, consumer loans grew at a 10-1/2 percent annual
rate last month.
The most recent data on bank earnings suggest that the trend to
move assets off the balance sheet has not hurt profitability (bottom
left panel). The sharp rise in second-quarter profits at commercial
banks mainly reflected a substantial rise in noninterest income,
which encompasses revenue generated from many off-balance-sheet
activities, including servicing and fee income from securitized
consumer and real estate loans. Second-quarter profits also
benefited from a slight widening of the net interest margin but were
held down by higher loan-loss provisioning. Even so, banks have
been able to hold provisioning to a relatively low level because

overall loan quality remains excellent: Some deterioration in the
performance of consumer loans has been offset by improvements in
commercial real estate loans, while delinquency and charge-off rates
on other types of loans have remained very low. As a result, banks'
loan-loss reserves continue to be high relative to their delinquent
loans (bottom right panel).
Despite the weakness in bank credit in August, M3 grew at a
5 percent annual rate, faster than in July but below the pace set in
the first half of the year. M3 is being supported by banks'
substitution toward large time deposits, which are included in M3,
and away from borrowings from foreign offices, which are not.
Institution-only money market mutual funds also grew briskly again
last month, likely owing to the drop in short-term market rates in
early August: Because changes in yields on these funds lag changes
in market rates, declines in market rates provide an incentive to
shift money into these funds temporarily.
M2 growth also picked up in August, rising at a 3-3/4 percent
rate, as the attractiveness of holding M2 assets improved in the
wake of the early August decline in short-term market rates. Retail
money market mutual funds, which have posted double-digit growth
rates for several quarters, rose at a 14-3/4 percent annual pace in
August.
M1 rose in August at a 4-1/2 percent pace after adjusting for
the initial effects of sweeps. While the sweep-adjusted growth of
other checkable deposits was moderate, currency continued to expand
rapidly, likely fueled by overseas demand. Demand deposits, a
relatively volatile component of M1, rebounded from their July
runoffs, growing at a 4-3/4 percent annual rate after adjusting for
the effects of a large new retail sweep program.
Mutual Funds
Net sales of equity mutual funds snapped back smartly in August
from the retrenchment in the wake of the mid-July drop in equity
prices; still, they remained somewhat below the record volume in the
first half of the year (chart, top panel). In addition, investor
demand for the more speculative of the equity funds resurfaced last
month (bottom panel). Inflows to bond funds also picked up in
August, fueled by stronger net sales at high-yield bond funds and at
income funds--which hold a mixture of bonds and stocks. The heavy
inflows at high-yield funds suggest that investors remain confident
about the earnings prospects of speculative-grade firms.

III-8
Preliminary data for the first two weeks of September show that
inflows to stock and bond funds remained reasonably firm.
Although we lack hard data on the types of investors that
pulled back from mutual funds in July, industry sources indicate
that retirement accounts were largely unaffected by the volatile
market conditions. It is thought that most individuals with
defined-contribution plans or IRA or Keogh accounts tend to review
their accounts only after receiving periodic statements, not on a
daily basis. Furthermore, most contributions are through automatic
payroll deductions and cannot be altered easily. These factors
suggest that retirement-related inflows may not be much affected by
short, relatively mild corrections.
Business Finance
Gross bond offerings by nonfinancial corporations in August
continued at about the reduced pace of July (table). Preliminary
data indicate that issuance slowed further in the first two weeks of
September. Issuance by investment-grade firms has likely been held
down of late by a limited need for external funding as well as by
the usual summer fall off in activity. Even so, speculative-grade
offerings rebounded in August from the lull in July. However, even
with the upturn, junk bond issuance in August remained below the
monthly average so far this year, and investors continued to take a
cautious view toward a few of the most speculative issues. With no
merger-related issuance, the volume of outstanding nonfinancial
commercial paper declined in August for a second month (chart, lower
left panel); data for the first few weeks of September show further
declines this month.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms, which plunged in
July, posted another sharp decline in August, leaving its level at
only one-quarter of the record high set in June (table). The
slowdown, which was likely magnified by July's market correction,
brings issuance into more normal alignment with past price movements
(lower right panel). Gross issuance remained weak in early
September.
Nonfinancial merger activity shows no sign of slowing, with the
volume of large deals through August running nearly 30 percent ahead
of last year's record pace (chart, upper panel). So far this year,
equity retirements have accounted for roughly half of the total
value of large nonfinancial mergers, about the same proportion as in
the preceding two years. However, with most of the pending mergers

structured as stock swaps--including virtually all of the large
telecommunications deals--merger-related equity retirements should
moderate in coming months. In contrast, announcements of share
repurchases have continued at a brisk pace, with large cash-rich
firms accounting for the bulk of the buybacks.
Recent movements in credit quality--as measured by changes in
Moody's ratings--remain favorable, with the value of debt upgraded
in July and August exceeding that downgraded by a sizable margin.
In addition, among the nonfinancial companies on Moody's Watchlist
at the beginning of September, the majority of debt--especially
speculative-grade debt--was on review for an upgrade. The pace of
junk bond defaults this year continues to run well below its
historical average, and junk bond spreads have returned to historic
lows after having widened a bit in July.
Another favorable indicator of business financial health is the
continued growth of corporate profits. Before-tax economic profits
of domestic nonfinancial corporations, as measured in the national
income and product accounts, posted another strong gain in the
second quarter, rising 19 percent from a year earlier. Healthy
profit growth throughout the current expansion has raised the profit
share of sector output for domestic nonfinancial corporations to its
highest level since the late 1970s (lower panel). Part of the
improvement in profits in recent years has resulted from lower
interest payments by firms. The share of profits plus net interest,
a broader measure of the return on capital that includes income to
creditors as well as equity holders, has increased less
dramatically.
Household Sector Finance
Household borrowing slowed in the second quarter, but growth
appears to be holding steady in more recent months. The growth of
total consumer credit picked up a bit in July, to an 8 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate, still well below the 12 percent
pace early in the year (table). The growth of revolving credit
rebounded in July following an unusually small rise in June; over
the two-month period, revolving credit advanced at a 12-1/2 percent
pace--below the first-half rate of almost 16 percent.
The growth of mortgage credit slowed in the second quarter from
its robust first-quarter pace. The few available indicators of
mortgage activity in the third quarter are mixed although leaning on
the side of some slowing. Builders' assessments of new home sales

activity have deteriorated in recent months, based on survey data.
Still, mortgage applications for home-purchase loans remain at a
relatively high level, and the average growth rate for real estate
loans at commercial banks over July and August was close to the
second-quarter rate.
Indicators of household credit quality in the second quarter
paint a mixed picture but on balance suggest some further
deterioration. Mortgage delinquency rates were little changed and
remain on the low side of historical experience. According to the
Mortgage Bankers Association survey, the delinquency rate for home
mortgages edged down in the second quarter; Call Report data, in
contrast, showed a slight increase (chart, top panel). The Call
Report delinquency rate for revolving home equity loans edged lower,
while the rate for other home mortgage loans increased a bit but
remained relatively low.
Delinquency rates for consumer loans in the second quarter
suggest that repayment problems worsened slightly, although most
delinquency rates remain well below historical peaks (middle panel).
The American Bankers Association (ABA) series for closed-end loans
has reversed about half of its decline from the 1991:Q3 high, and
bank Call Report data show a similar pattern.
Credit card delinquencies continue to portray a less reassuring
picture. The ABA series for credit card delinquencies reached
another new high in the second quarter (bottom panel). Data from
the Call Report also show that delinquencies moved higher but have
yet to approach the previous peak. A Moody's series for
delinquencies on credit card receivables in securitized pools rose
in June but is well below the level it reached in the last
recession. Problems with credit card loans have been linked with
personal bankruptcies, which rose to more than 1 million at an
annual rate in the first half of this year.
Treasury and Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance the
projected $40 billion third-quarter fiscal deficit mostly by
borrowing from the public and that the cash balance will decline
only slightly (table). Because the midquarter refunding included a
thirty-year bond, borrowing has tilted toward coupon issues and away
from bills, with net bill redemptions of $15 billion. By contrast,
coupon auctions are expected to raise $51 billion.

Over the intermeeting period, the General Accounting Office
released a study concluding that Treasury Secretary Rubin had
operated within his authority in shifting securities out of
government trust funds to avoid a default during the debt-ceiling
crisis late in 1995.
Little time remains in the current session for the Congress to
pass legislation to shore up the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
The plan approved by the House Banking Committee will likely face
opposition by independent insurance agents, who have opposed any
banking bill that does not roll back the insurance powers of
banks.1 Treasury Secretary Rubin also opposes the bill partly on
the grounds that it would unacceptably weaken consumer protection
rules. Despite the lack of legislation, FICO spreads over
Treasuries actually narrowed 1 to 3 basis points over the past
month, to 29 basis points for the three-year strips and 40 basis
points for the nineteen-year strips. Spreads of other agency-issued
securities over comparable Treasuries remained stable at about
15 basis points for five-year notes and 30 basis points for ten-year
notes.
Municipal Bonds
Gross offerings of long-term municipal debt totaled nearly
$13 billion in August, up slightly from the pace in July but off a
good bit from the second quarter (table). Much of the decline is
attributable to a seasonal slowdown in new capital volume.
Refunding issuance picked up in August to about the average pace in
the first half of the year. Indeed, trade reports indicate that
several large issuers tapped the market to take advantage of the
light supply of and strong investor demand for debt. Although
retirements of long-term debt dropped back in August from July's
heavy pace, they again exceeded gross issuance, resulting in a net
decline in debt outstanding. The ratio of yields on thirty-year
tax-exempt securities to comparable Treasuries has maintained its
low level over the intermeeting period: in mid-September, it was the
lowest it has been since early 1995.
1. A proposal to use of the Federal Reserve surplus to support
FICO bonds was approved by committee, but was dropped by
Representative Leach.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
The deficit in U.S. international trade in goods and services
widened substantially in July. Exports were 3-1/2 percent lower
than the level in June, while imports rose 1-1/4 percent. The
decline in exports reflected a temporary drop in shipments of
aircraft, reduced transfers of gold, a further decline in exports of
semiconductors, and decreased exports of volatile categories such as
automotive products, consumer goods, and other industrial supplies.
It appears that a portion of the overall decline in exports in July
reflects a residual seasonal in the data.
A large portion of the increase in imports in July was in
services (payment of Olympic-related fees and royalties) and oil
(almost entirely quantity).
Data for August will be released on October 18.

In the second quarter, the deficit in net exports of goods and
services was substantially larger than in the first quarter, and
moved back to levels last recorded a year ago. Between the first
and second quarters, NIPA real exports grew at a 6 percent annual
rate; real imports rose at a 10 percent annual rate.
The increase in real exports of goods and services in the
second quarter was largely in aircraft and computers and to a lesser
extent in consumer goods and automotive products to Canada (partly a
rebound in shipments after the strike in March against GM).
Shipments of gold rose sharply in the second quarter, largely

reflecting foreign holdings at the FRBNY being transferred out of
the country; imports of gold were raised by a similar amount in the
second quarter as the gold left the FRBNY and moved into U.S.
customs territory. Net exports of gold in the second quarter were
close to zero. By area, the increase in merchandise exports over the
first half of 1996 was largely to Canada, Mexico, and the United
Kingdom.
The sharp increase in imports in the second quarter was spread
among almost all major trade categories and largely reflected the
strength of U.S. economic activity during the first half of the
year. One exception to this trend was imports of semiconductors
which dropped substantially.
About half of the rise in the value of imports was in imported
oil. The increase in the second quarter was about evenly split
between price and quantity. A larger than normal seasonal inventory
accumulation that has rebuilt stocks from historically low levels
offset the seasonal decline in oil consumption. Preliminary
Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports declined a
bit on average in August from the brisk July pace as refiners
trimmed stocks in anticipation of a decline in crude prices once oil
shipments from Iraq commence.
Oil prices. In July, the price of imported oil increased
slightly. This increase followed substantial price declines during
the previous two months. The decline in oil prices between April
and July reflected an unwinding of temporary weather and production
shocks to the oil market earlier in the year. Even after declines in
May and June, the price of imported oil in the second quarter was 11
percent higher than in the first quarter. Spot WTI rose nearly
$0.90 per barrel in July, averaging $21.32 per barrel and rose
another $0.70 per barrel in August. Following recent political
upheaval in Northern Iraq, spot WTI has been quite volatile and is
trading in the $22.00-24.00 per barrel range. Although Iraq
reached an agreement in July with the United Nations to export a
limited quantity of oil (estimated to be 800,000 b/d) under U.N.
supervision, oil prices have remained firm since then because of
uncertainty regarding the timing of these oil flows. On September
1. the U.N. Secretary General announced that these oil sales would
be postponed.

IV-6
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports declined slightly in July,
about the same as in each of the two previous months. There were
decreases in prices of all major end-use categories (particularly
foods and industrial supplies) with the exception of automotive
products (which rose slightly).
In the second quarter, prices of non-oil imports decreased at
a rate that was slightly more than in the two previous quarters.
Prices of imported capital goods (especially computers and
semiconductors) and industrial supplies fell sharply. These
decreases were only partly offset by substantial price increases in
a broad array of imported foods (coffee, grains, and vegetables)
that occurred early in the quarter.
Prices of exports declined slightly in July, primarily because
of falling prices of agricultural products, as agricultural
developments in the northern hemisphere reported recently have
pointed to a robust supply response this fall. Agricultural export
prices had been recording double-digit increases from September 1995
through May 1996, following disappointing grain harvests last year
at a time of vigorous world demand. Prices of nonagricultural
products have declined in each of the past four quarters at a 5-10
percent annual rate (led by decreases in prices of exported
industrial supplies and computers). These prices also declined in
July.
Price data for August will be released on September 24.
U.S. Current Account through 1996-Q2
The U.S. current-account deficit widened $15.6 billion SAAR in
the second quarter. The increase in the deficit on goods and
services (described above) and a shift to a deficit on investment
income more than offset lower net unilateral transfers.
Net investment income swung back into deficit in the second
quarter as income payments to foreigners on investments in the
United States rose more than U.S. income receipts on earnings from
investments abroad. Net unilateral transfers were smaller in the
second quarter than in the first quarter because of a reduction in
U.S. Government grants: grants in the first quarter had been boosted
by outflows displaced from the fourth quarter of 1995 by temporary
Federal Budget constraints.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were
huge in July. (See line 4a of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.) About 60 percent of this total was booked in a
single location, the Netherlands Antilles; moreover, these latter
purchases were financed primarily by RP transactions with banks and
securities dealers in the United States, accounting for more than
half of the large net outflow reported in line 3 of the Summary
table. However, monthly average data for banks (but excluding
securities dealers and IBFs) show none of the outflow registered in
the end-of-month data for July, and only a small net outflow in
August (line 1 of the International Banking Data table).
Net foreign private purchases of corporate and other bonds
were also quite strong in July, but almost half of the total was for
U.S. government agency bonds (line 4b of the Summary table).
Although private foreigners sold U.S. corporate stocks net in July,

the absolute size of the outflow continued at the low levels
observed in recent months (line 4c).
U.S. investors purchased foreign securities net at a moderate
rate in July, about equally divided between bonds and stocks (lines
5a and 5b of the Summary table). These purchases were not
concentrated in any particular country or region.
The increase in foreign official reserve assets held in the
United States was smaller in July than in June (line 1). Partial
information from FRBNY indicates more substantial increases in
August and early September.
Recently released data on direct investment capital flows for
the second quarter show a continuation of strong capital outflows
from the United States (line 6). Direct investment capital inflows
fell significantly in the second quarter (line 7); since there was
no evidence of a fall-off in foreign takeovers in the United States,
the lower capital inflows suggest a shift in the financing of these
activities to domestic U.S. sources.
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets
The weighted-average dollar has appreciated about 1/2 percent
on balance since the time of the August FOMC meeting. The dollar
rose during the first week and a half of September amid heightened
market expectations of an imminent tightening of U.S. monetary
policy. These expectations receded somewhat after the release of
softer-than-expected data on retail sales and consumer prices. The
dollar fell back on September 18, mainly on the release of data
showing a bigger-than-expected jump in the U.S. trade deficit in
July. The dollar's move upward earlier in the period was preceded
by a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates, that on average, was not
matched abroad. On balance, during this period, the differential
between U.S. and average foreign long-term interest rates has
widened about 35 basis points in favor of the dollar.
Since August 20, the dollar gained 3/4 percent against the
Japanese yen, as market participants reassessed the strength of the
current economic expansion in Japan. The weaker-than-expected
Tankan survey for August suggested a lower likelihood of a near-term
increase in official interest rates. The release of data showing
that real GDP declined in the second quarter as well as the
increased likelihood of an early general election in October

contributed to this change in market perceptions. Rising tensions
in Iraq and heightened concerns about the vulnerability of the
Japanese economy to a sharp rise in oil prices also seemed to weigh
on the yen. The yen recovered with the news of the unexpectedly
large U.S. trade deficit, reversing more than half of the dollar's
earlier gains against the yen.
The dollar appreciated 1-1/4 percent against the mark since
the time of the August FOMC meeting. On August 22, the Bundesbank
Council surprised the market and lowered the German repo rate 30
basis points to 3.00 percent, the first change in this rate since
February. Central banks in Austria, Belgium, France, and the
Netherlands followed the Bundesbank's action with smaller 20 basis
point reductions in their official rates. The Bank of Canada also
cut its official rates on August 22, bringing down its target band
for the overnight rate 25 basis points to 3.75 to 4.25 percent.
Sweden's Riksbank gradually lowered its repo rate 25 basis points
since the August FOMC meeting.
Although prospects for German economic expansion appear to
have improved, recent statements by Bundesbank officials hinting
that there may be room for a further reduction in official rates if
money growth continues to moderate have rekindled hopes that
monetary policy will be eased a bit further. Prospects of easier
monetary policy in Germany weakened the mark against several other
European currencies, such as the French franc, relieving pressures
felt earlier in the period. Factors that recently have weighed on
the franc include worries about the weak pace of French economic
expansion, concerns about the government's ability to lower the
deficit/GDP ratio to 3 percent in 1997, and fears of renewed labor
unrest in protest of planned public spending cuts.
Since the August FOMC meeting, 10-year rates have fallen
abroad, on average nearly 15 basis points. Long-term interest rates
fell in all of the major foreign industrial countries except Canada,
where they rose about 15 basis points, and the United Kingdom, where
they did not change, on balance, as recent indicators in both these
countries have suggested a pickup in economic activity. The biggest
declines in long-term rates occurred in Sweden and Italy (25-30
basis points), amid improved prospects for fiscal consolidation,
better-than-expected progress in reducing inflation, and gathering

IV-13
evidence that economic activity has slowed. Japanese long-term
rates also fell about 25 basis points, in part owing to a less
sanguine view of the recent strength of the economic expansion.
Short-term interest rates in the major foreign industrial
countries have fallen on average almost 25 basis points during this
period. The biggest declines in 3-month rates (40-45 basis points)
occurred in Italy, France, Sweden, and Switzerland. In the United
Kingdom, 3-month interest rates rose slightly from their level at
the time of the August FOMC meeting.
The dollar has risen more than 2-1/2 percent against the Swiss
franc during this period, reflecting large liquidity injections by
the Swiss National Bank aimed at reinvigorating the flagging economy
and preventing, and hopefully reversing, appreciation of the franc
against the mark. Over the past few years, the franc has become
overvalued relative to the mark. Recently, the Swiss National Bank
seems to have effectively abandoned its medium-term money supply
target for an exchange rate target against the DM. Swiss call-money
rates decreased more than a full percentage point since the August
FOMC meeting, while 3-month rates are down nearly 45 basis points,
and 10-year rates declined 20 basis points.
The dollar has weakened 3/4 percent against sterling, amid
mounting evidence that U.K. economic activity has picked up lately,
reducing the probability of further official interest rate cuts.
The pound may have also benefited from higher oil prices as the
United Kingdom is a small net exporter of oil. The dollar also
declined slightly against the Canadian dollar, but appreciated about
1/2 percent against the Mexican peso during the period.
Foreign equity prices, which fell sharply in June and July,
have risen on balance since the August FOMC meeting. U.K., German,
and Canadian stock prices, have recovered to levels near peaks
reached earlier this year. In contrast, the recovery of stock
prices in France, Italy, and Japan has lagged behind, probably
reflecting less optimism about economic activity in those countries.
The Desk did not
intervene for U.S. monetary authorities during the period.

IV-14
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
A now-complete set of second-quarter GDP data for the foreign
G-7 countries confirm some pickup in growth in the first half of
1996 relative to the preceding year. Despite a drop in GDP in the
second quarter, Japanese growth on balance was strong in the first
half, and the economy appears to have continued to expand into the
summer months. German GDP rebounded sharply in the second quarter,
and more recent indicators suggest further expansion. Although
second-quarter GDP in the United Kingdom was held down by slower
inventory investment, final demand was robust, and other indicators
have been positive. Recent indicators in Canada also suggest that
activity is picking up following a sluggish second quarter. In
contrast, both the French and Italian economies have been stagnant
in recent months.
Unemployment rates are still high in most countries, and
inflation pressures remain subdued. Recent year-over-year consumer-
price inflation has averaged about 1-1/2 percent in Germany and
Canada, slightly more in France, and under 3 percent in the United
Kingdom. Italian inflation has continued to trend down, dipping
below 3-1/2 percent in August. As a result of yen depreciation,
Japanese prices have risen slightly this year after declining
throughout most of 1995.
Fiscal policy continues to be restrictive in most countries,
with Germany and France in particular attempting to reduce their
budget-deficit-to-GDP ratios to or below the Maastricht reference
value of 3 percent by 1997. Although the Italian government does
not expect to reach a 3 percent budget balance ratio, a substantial
reduction is planned there as well.
Individual country notes. In Japan real GDP declined 2.9
percent (SAAR) in the second quarter, after a downward-revised 12.2
percent increase in the first quarter. A sharp drop in private
consumption accounted for the entire decrease in GDP, while growth
in private residential and nonresidential investment roughly offset
declines in inventory investment, government consumption, and net
exports. About 2 percentage points of the decline in GDP is
accounted for by the extra leap-year day in the first quarter.

Recent indicators point to continued expansion. In July,
industrial production was about 2-1/2 percent above its second-
quarter level, while machinery orders and housing starts grew at a
robust pace. New car registrations dipped in August following a
large gain in July, but remain on an upward trend. The unemployment
rate dropped slightly in July, and the ratio of job offers to job
applicants has increased gradually since late last year.
The Bank of Japan's August survey (Tankan) registered a small
decrease in the diffusion index of business sentiment at major
manufacturers from its May level, contrary to market expectations of
a slight increase. Although the indexes for smaller manufacturers
and major non-manufacturers increased modestly in the August survey,
the index for smaller non-manufacturers edged down. Fixed
investment plans for the current fiscal year of both large and small
manufacturers increased sharply over their year-ago levels.
Month-to-month changes in wholesale and consumer prices have
been positive in recent months. These increases stem from the
effect of past yen depreciation on import prices, as prices of
domestically produced goods have continued to decline.
The current account surplus increased sharply in May following
many months of decline and rose further in June before edging down
in July. The merchandise trade surplus was $6.7 billion (SA) in
August, up sharply from the second-quarter average.

Real GDP in Germany rebounded sharply in the second quarter,
rising more than 6 percent (SAAR), following a 2 percent decline in
the first quarter. Domestic demand and net exports contributed
about equally to second-quarter growth. Investment was particularly
strong, as construction activity surged following the unseasonably
cold winter, although spending on machinery and equipment remained
lackluster. Private consumption registered a healthy increase,
while government expenditures rose despite a freeze on federal
expenditures imposed by the Finance Ministry in mid-March. The
improvement in net exports reflected an increase in exports coupled
with a drop in imports. A sizable decline in the level of inventory
investment, which is a residual in the national accounts and can be
subject to substantial revision, made a significant negative
contribution to growth in the second quarter.
Limited information available for the third quarter suggests
that activity continued to expand, albeit at a somewhat more muted
pace. Industrial production in July was nearly 1 percent above its
second-quarter average level, and manufacturing orders continued to
trend up. A rise in the IFO business climate survey in July more
than reversed the surprising drop in June. Unemployment, while
still high, has levelled out at just above 3.9 million workers
(s.a.), and the all-German unemployment rate has remained at

10.3 percent since April. Inflation remains subdued, with producer
prices down over the past 12 months and consumer prices up by a
little under 1-1/2 percent.
The 1997 draft federal budget was approved by Chancellor
Kohl's cabinet in mid-July. Many of the austerity measures
incorporated into the 1997 draft budget stem from the fiscal plan
proposed last April. Measures in the plan have been split into five
different pieces of legislation, three of which received final
parliamentary approval on September 13. The remaining two pieces of
legislation require the explicit approval of the Bundesrat (the
upper house of the German parliament). With the draft budget, which
includes very low wage increases for public sector employees, as
well as some spending reductions at the state and local level, the
German Finance Ministry hopes to move the deficit of the
consolidated general government sector to 2-1/2 percent of GDP in
1997, below the Maastricht reference value.
In France, real GDP contracted 1.5 percent (SAAR) in the
second quarter following a 4.5 percent increase in the first
quarter. The swing in growth between the first and second quarters
was exaggerated by both inadequate adjustment for leap year as well
as a first-quarter rebound from the public sector strikes at the end
of last year. However, even abstracting from these effects some
slowing in demand appears to have occurred in the second quarter.
Private consumption, the category most affected by the strike, was
only slightly above its average level over the preceding half-year
in the second quarter, while investment declined for the third
straight quarter and government spending slowed. Inventories
continued to be drawn down, although at a more moderate pace than in
the first quarter. Net exports contributed negatively to GDP growth
as a result of a sharp decline in exports.
Monthly indicators for the third quarter are scant (and
combined July-August data will not be available until late
September). In July, the unemployment rate was unchanged at its
all-time high, and business and consumer sentiment remained subdued.
The fall in consumer prices in July and August reflected lower food
and energy prices, as well as soft domestic demand.

On September 18, the government unveiled its 1997 central
government budget, designed to reduce the consolidated deficit to 3
percent in 1997. The central government deficit is projected to
narrow only a small amount, as tax reform implies a gross cut of
FF25 billion (1/4 percent of GDP), while nominal spending is held to
the 1996 budgeted levels. The 3 percent target is expected to be
attained through an improvement in the social security deficit,
expected surpluses on other welfare accounts, and creative
accounting measures (such as a one-time payment from France Telecom
worth 1/2 percent of GDP).
Earlier in September the government announced a five-year tax
reform program beginning next year that includes lower income tax
rates and payroll taxes partially offset by fewer deductions, higher
excise taxes, and a one-percent hike in the CSG (a flat tax on most
forms of income), the base of which will also be widened. One
objective of the reform is to boost consumption by lowering income
taxes, while raising other taxes in order to underline the
government's commitment to fiscal consolidation.

expanded strongly. A sharp slowdown in inventory accumulation
provided the main offset to positive growth in other components of

Indicators from the third quarter on balance point to a pickup
in the pace of economic activity. Retail sales fell in July but
rebounded strongly in August, confirming recent survey evidence
suggesting a significant increase in consumer demand. Industrial
production moved up in July following a sharp fall in June to a
level a little above the second-quarter average. The purchasing
managers' index for August was at its highest level in a year and
signaled particular strength in manufacturing output, while the
unemployment rate continued to decline, reaching 7.5 percent in
August. Consumer price inflation has held steady around 2-3/4
percent in recent months, a little above the government's target
rate of 2-1/2 percent or less.

In Italy, the advance GDP release stated that real economic
activity declined 2 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. [No
further details will be available until final second-quarter GDP is
released on October 4.] This drop reversed the first-quarter
increase, with both movements largely due to inadequate adjustment
for the leap year. Little information is available beyond the
second quarter; consumer confidence declined in July, although it
was a little above its second-quarter average.
News on inflation continues to be encouraging. Consumer price
inflation on a year-over-year basis fell in August to its lowest
level in 27 years. Further progress on consumer price inflation is

IV-22
likely in light of continued moderation in wholesale and producer
price inflation, reflecting the appreciation of the lira over the
past year and a half.

Prime Minister Romano Prodi is expected to present his
government's 1997 federal budget to parliament by the end of
September. The government's 1997-1999 economic planning document--
which forms the basis of next year's budget--calls for the general
government deficit to improve to 4.4 percent of GDP, falling short
of the Maastricht Treaty reference value of 3 percent in 1997.1
Economic activity in Canada expanded at a slow pace in the
second quarter. Although the rate of growth was the same as in the
first quarter, it reflected a considerably weaker domestic economy
offset by a rebound in net exports. Consumption expenditures were
about flat, while business fixed investment declined, as a pickup in
residential construction was offset by declines in machinery and
equipment investment and non-residential construction. A large
draw-down in inventories, following ten consecutive quarters of
accumulation, subtracted 2.9 percent from the quarter's growth. Net
exports made a large positive contribution, as exports increased

when adjusted to conform to the Maastricht definition, the figure is closer
to 5.4 percent.---

and the decline in machinery and equipment investment.

Indicators for the third quarter suggest that activity is
expanding at a moderate pace. Manufacturing shipments and new
orders both advanced markedly in July, and strong employment growth
in August more than offset declines in May and June. Housing starts
retreated in July and were little changed in August, although the
average of the two months was about 3 percent above the second-
quarter level. Consumer price inflation remains subdued and near
the bottom of the Bank of Canada's 1-3 percent target band.
The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) reached a tentative three-year
labor agreement with Chrysler Corporation Canada on September 17,
averting a possible strike at Chrysler's Canadian facilities. The
possibility of a Canadian auto strike remains, however, as the CAW
will now attempt to extend the agreement to cover workers at Ford
Canada and General Motors of Canada.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, the economies of Argentina and Brazil are
recovering from their low points in 1995, while the Mexican economy
slowed a bit in the second quarter and Venezuela's domestic demand
fell sharply. The Russian economy has continued to decline.
Inflation slowed in Mexico, Venezuela, and Russia in recent months,
and has been low in Brazil by that country's standards. In the
major Asian developing economies, economic growth is proceeding at a
moderate pace, with Korea showing some evidence of an increase in
inflationary pressures. Mexico's trade surplus narrowed slightly
and Brazil and Argentina secured small trade deficits, while
Venezuela's deficit has increased substantially in the last few
months. In Asia, Taiwan's trade balance has improved markedly
despite slow export growth, while China's surplus has decreased and
Korea's deficit has shown a considerable widening.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, economic growth slowed
in the second quarter, following three quarters of strong recovery
from the sharp downturn in the first half of 1995. Real GDP
declined an estimated 0.3 percent (SA, not annual rate) in the
second quarter and industrial production rose less than 2 percent
(SA, not annual rate), half the average quarterly growth rate in the
three previous quarters. Imports grew in July to reach their
highest level since December 1994, indicating that domestic demand
is continuing to recover. Exports also grew substantially, but not
as fast as imports, resulting in some narrowing of the trade
surplus. The current account balance improved in the second
quarter, but most of the gain was due to a decrease in net factor
payments, especially interest payments.
Monthly inflation fell from a recent peak of 2.8 percent in
April to 1.3 percent in August. While the decline partly reflects
seasonal factors, the stability of the exchange rate and continued
tight monetary policy are expected to continue to keep inflationary
pressures subdued in the coming months.
On August 7, the Bank of Mexico began a program to rebuild its
international reserves, without appearing to manage the exchange
rate, by selling dollar put options at auction to commercial banks.
The strike price of the options on any given day is the previous
day's reference exchange rate (providing that the rate is no weaker

IV-28
than the average of the preceding twenty trading days). The Bank
sold $130 million in options at the first auction on August 7, all
of which were exercised within a few days of the auction.

Due to the success of the program in its first month and the
continued stability of the peso, the amount sold at the second
auction on August 30 was raised to $200 million. The 20-day
constraint remained binding for the first half of September (thus no
options were exercised), though the recent firming of the peso
removed that constraint by September 17.
In Argentina, real GDP grew 3.2 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier and July industrial production showed an
increase of 7.3 percent compared with a year earlier, providing
solid evidence that the economy is recovering. Notwithstanding
higher economic activity, inflation has remained low, with August
consumer prices 0.1 percent above their year-earlier level, The
trade surplus remained almost unchanged in July. International
reserves less gold and securities reached $14.6 billion at end-
August, a bit lower than in May and June due to the political
uncertainty created by the dismissal of Finance Minister Cavallo.
Argentina's slow recovery from the recession led to lower than
expected tax revenues and the larger than expected fiscal deficit
for the first half of 1996. The package of measures sent to Congress
by the government to compensate for the shortfall has been
continuously delayed, and it is expected to yield only about $600-
800 million in savings this year, instead of the $1.6 billion

originally planned. These measures were not well received by
Argentines, and the largest union federation, the CGT, called for
another general strike on September 26 and 27. Menem angered the
unions further in early September, when he announced his intention
to pass a labor reform package that includes suspending collective
wage bargaining and replacing redundancy payouts with unemployment
insurance. On September 16, the IMF released a statement indicating
that it supports Argentina's program to reduce the fiscal deficit to
about $5 billion (1.7 percent of GDP) in 1996.
In addition to the efforts to contain its fiscal difficulties,
Argentina is working to strengthen its banking system. The Central
Bank has announced a program with foreign private banks in Argentina
to create a contingency fund against possible banking liquidity
crises of between $3-5 billion (which represents about 10 percent of
deposits). The Repo Program, as it is called, involves an automatic
credit line in exchange for dollar-denominated government bonds from
foreign private banks to the Central Bank in case of a liquidity
crisis. It is not yet clear when the system will go into effect.
In Brazil, there are indications that the economy is beginning
to recover. Real GDP grew 1.7 percent (SA, not annual rate) in the
second quarter from the previous period, and industrial output (SA)
increased in July. Inflation has remained low by Brazilian
standards. The cumulative trade deficit for January to July was
$0.5 billion, compared with a $4.3 billion deficit a year earlier.
International reserves at the end of July 1996 totalled $60 billion
(liquidity concept), up considerably from $42 billion a year ago.

On September 5, Brazil announced new rules allowing Brazilian
banks to raise capital overseas by placing bonds abroad and using
the resources to lend to exporters with 180-day maturities.
Previously, raising capital overseas for exports had been limited to
agricultural goods. In mid-September, President Cardoso signed a
bill exempting shipments from export taxes.

In addition, Brazil has removed some products from a low-tariff
group of import items, effectively increasing import tariffs on the
items from 4-6 percent to 12-16 percent. On September 12, the
Brazilian Senate approved a Central Bank request to conduct
unlimited buybacks of the country's $57 billion Brady Bonds.
In Venezuela, consumer price inflation fell further in August,
partly due to an estimated 18 percent drop in consumer demand since
the start of its IMF austerity program in mid-April. The non-oil
trade deficit has widened slightly in July, but has remained fairly
stable every month since April. Total reserves less gold have
increased since the stabilization package was announced in April and
reached $8.4 billion at the end of July, up from $6.7 billion in
May. This increase in net capital inflows has led to a 17 percent
rise in M2 and a subsequent drop in interest rates by 48 percentage
points to around 20 percent a year over the past three months.
On July 31, Venezuela announced the creation of a special
fund, the Debt Rescue Fund, which will use windfall revenues from
oil prices higher than $14.70 per barrel to pay off foreign and

domestic debt commitments. As of September 5, Venezuela's basket of
crude and products had risen to $20 per barrel, while the average
for the year so far is $17 per barrel. The higher oil prices are
expected to yield about $2.5 billion in additional revenue.
Although Venezuela has been doing well overall with the new
IMF program, its privatization program is in shambles. On August
28, Venezuela cancelled the sale of Banco de Venezuela after rumors
and confusion led to the withdrawal of bids, and the program could
be threatened by political disputes. Venezuela's top banks have
traditionally been associated with different political parties that
have used them to bankroll election campaigns and to provide jobs
for supporters. Only days earlier, the sale of Alucasa. a small
aluminum concern, was delayed, and at the beginning of September
union protests began over the proposed year-end privatization of the
state-owned holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG).
In China, real GDP increased by 9.8 percent in the first half
of 1996 from its year-earlier level, as strong growth in consumption
demand offset much weaker growth in investment. The central bank
cut its lending rate by about 40 basis points on August 22,
following an earlier interest rate cut in May. The apparent easing
in credit conditions in recent months reflects the authorities'
perception that a more accommodative stance is warranted, given a
sharp fall in inflation over the past year, as well as to help
alleviate the heavy debt-servicing burden of state-run enterprises.
The authorities estimate that 50 percent of state-run enterprises
are unprofitable, though this figure appears conservative. China's
trade surplus in the first eight months of the year declined to $5
billion, compared with $15.4 billion in the same period last year.

IV-32
The decline in the surplus reflected a fall in the level of exports
of about 4 percent over the period from its year-earlier level.
Consumer prices in July were 8.3 percent higher than their year-
earlier level.

Real GDP in Taiwan expanded 5.4 percent in the second quarter
from its year-earlier level. The central bank announced a cut in
the discount rate of 25 basis points on August 9, following a
similar reduction in late May. The interest rate cuts are intended
to stimulate domestic demand, which has experienced weak growth by
historical standards for more than a year. Slow domestic demand
growth has been reflected in a fall of about 1 percent in the level
of Taiwan's imports during the first eight months of the year. This
decline contributed to a widening of the trade surplus to $8.2
billion over the same period, compared with $3.5 billion a year
earlier. Taiwan's 12-month inflation rate rose to 5.1 percent in
August, a noticeable increase from an average rate of below 3
percent during the first seven months of the year. However, most of
the jump in the inflation rate in August was attributed to temporary
factors, mainly reflecting a spike in food prices following Typhoon
Herb.

In Korea, real GDP grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from
its year-earlier level, a marked decline from output growth rates of
nearly 10 percent in the first three quarters of last year. Fixed
investment spending has been particularly sluggish, expanding only
4.2 percent in the second quarter from its year-earlier level.
Despite the slowdown in activity, the central bank has raised
interest rates several hundred basis points during the past few
months, after having maintained an accommodative monetary policy
stance during the latter part of 1995 and first few months of this
year. The recent tightening apparently reflects concern about a
significant widening of the current account deficit and some
evidence of a modest pickup in inflation. The current account
deficit widened to $11.7 billion in the first seven months of this
year, compared with $6.5 billion a year earlier. Weak export growth
contributed to the larger deficit, as exports expanded only 9
percent over the period from their year-earlier level. The
authorities have allowed the won to depreciate about 6 percent
against the dollar since late April to partly offset a deterioration
in Korea's external competitiveness associated with the strong
appreciation of the won against the yen during the past year. The
consumer price index increased 5.3 percent in August from its year-
earlier level, compared with a rise of 3.5 percent a year earlier.

In Russia, Boris Yeltsin essentially disappeared from public
view after having won the mid-June election. However, in a break
from past reluctance to admit health problems, he announced last
week that he will undergo heart surgery in Moscow at the end of
September, and calmed financial markets.
Economic activity has continued to decline in 1996.
Second-quarter GDP and industrial production were down 7 and 5
percent respectively from their levels a year ago. Consumer price
inflation has been at the lowest levels since the 1992 beginning of
the reforms. Cumulative inflation for the first seven months of
1996 was 16.1 percent. The ruble has declined about 1 percent in
the past two weeks, which is slightly faster than its planned
depreciation of about 1.5 percent per month. However, the ruble
still remains well within the corridor established by the Central
Bank. Interest rates on government securities remain high in
nominal terms: the six-month treasury bill yield averaged 78
percent this week, up from last week's 74 percent, indicating
continuing political and economic uncertainty.
Russia has now completed two quarterly reviews and four
monthly reviews under its three-year, $10.1 billion Extended Fund
Facility (EFF). The program's conditions must be met for funds to
be disbursed. Although the IMF has not yet denied a payment, the

July payment was delayed for two weeks until Russian authorities
took steps to boost inadequate tax collections. However, the IMF
approved an increase in the target for the 1996 budget deficit from
4 percent of GDP to 5.25 percent when it became clear that the
original target would not be met.
