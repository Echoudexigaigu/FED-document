The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from  the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redact ed passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    
 
                                                
 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and we re not checked or corrected by staff.

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The economy exhibited moderate growth early in the fourth
quarter. Employment continued to increase at a solid clip in the
first two months of the quarter, and consumer spending revived
after a summer lull. Meanwhile, inflation remained on a fairly
steady trend, with the core CPI continuing to run just above
2-1/2 percent on a twelve-month basis.
Real GDP
According to BEA's preliminary estimate, real GDP rose at an
annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, 0.2 percentage point
less than in the advance report. The revision reflected sharp
downward adjustments to inventory investment and net exports, which
were partially offset by upward adjustments to consumer spending,
business fixed investment, and government expenditures. Data
received since the preliminary report suggest that slightly higher
inventories will lead BEA to revise third-quarter GDP growth back up
to the area of 2-1/4 percent. However, none of these revisions
alters the basic expenditure mix portrayed in the advance report:
strong business fixed investment and inventory accumulation but weak
consumer spending and net exports.
The BEA report also indicated that gross domestic income (GDI),
which rose 4 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and
3-1/2 percent during the past year, continued to grow substantially
faster than GDP.1 Total economic profits (including inventory
valuation and capital consumption adjustments) held steady in the
third quarter after strong gains over the first half of the year,
and the profit share edged down only a tad, to 8.6 percent.
Domestic nonfinancial profits were up for the third straight quarter
and about offset declines in profits from the domestic financial
sector and the foreign sector.
Labor Market Developments
The November survey of establishments revealed continued solid
demand for labor. Private nonfarm payrolls rose 140,000, after
1. The difference between the product- and income-side measures
has led to a sharp widening in the statistical discrepancy in recent
years. Because BEA truncated this year's normal annual revision
process and because the swing in the statistical discrepancy is so
dramatic, we find it useful to examine both the product-based and
income-based measures.

surging 230,000 in October.2 The average workweek of private
production or nonsupervisory workers rose to 34.5 hours in November,
reversing half of its October decline and lifting the workweek
0.1 hour above the average for the first ten months of the year.
Aggregate hours of production workers in November stood 0.4 percent
above their third-quarter average.
Private employment gains were widespread in November. Payrolls
rose 118,000 in the service-producing sector, led by increases in
health services, private educational services, and computer
services. However, employment in help supply services, which had
been at a high level since a big jump in August, dropped back
32,000, to below its July reading. Anecdotal reports suggest that a
possible explanation for at least part of the weakness in employment
in this industry is that firms had difficulty hiring additional
workers. Employment in retail trade rose 17,000 in November after a
sharp increase in October that BLS attributes, in large part, to
unusually early seasonal hiring at general merchandise and apparel
stores. In the goods-producing sector, both construction and
manufacturing firms added jobs in November. The gains included a
second consecutive strong month for aircraft and parts.
Employment, as measured by the household survey, fell 30,000 in
November, and the labor force expanded 244,000. The published
unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage point, to 5.4 percent,
but the unemployment rate estimated with concurrent seasonal factors
edged up only 0.1 percentage point, to 5.3 percent. Among
demographic groups, increases in unemployment rates were largest for
teenagers (16.1 to 17.0 percent) and men aged 20 to 24 (8.7 to 9.3
percent). Unemployment rates for prime-age workers (those 25 to 54
years old) held steady at 4.0 percent for men and rose slightly from
4.3 to 4.5 percent for women. The labor force participation rate
remained at 66.9 percent. 1/2 percentage point higher than a year
ago.
Other labor market indicators hint at a bit more strength than
is apparent in the recent household and payroll surveys. Weekly
initial claims for unemployment insurance (state programs only)
averaged 332,000 during the past four weeks--a level historically
associated with faster employment growth. The Conference Board's
help-wanted index (with FRB adjustments) was little changed in
2. With the November labor market report. BLS updated the
seasonal factors in the payroll survey for September through
November of this year.

October from the relatively high level experienced during the past
two years. The Manpower Inc. index of net hiring plans for the
first quarter of 1997 was up from a year ago. (Judging from earlier
patterns, this increase probably says more about the fourth quarter
than the first.) Perceptions of labor market conditions, as
reported by the Conference Board and Michigan surveys, also remained
quite favorable through November.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers
on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.8 percent in November after
edging down 0.1 percent in October. Averaging over those two
months, wage increases were particularly large in the retail trade
and services industries--industries where October's increase in the
minimum wage most likely would appear. More broadly, the recent
data provide further indication of acceleration in total average
hourly earnings. Wages have risen 3.5 percent during the past
twelve months--0.6 percentage point more than during the preceding
twelve-month period.
Growth in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector in the
third quarter was revised down 1/2 percentage point and now shows a
slight decline. Productivity growth earlier in the year was revised
up slightly, but growth during the four quarters of 1995 was revised
3down, from 0.3 percent to -0.1 percent. All told, the data now
show that nonfarm business productivity has grown at an annual rate
of 0.9 percent since the last business cycle peak (1990:Q3), rather
than the 1.0 percent pace estimated prior to the revision.
Output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate business sector
increased at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the third quarter and
1.7 percent annually since the last peak. This estimate is based on
data from the income side of the NIPA and excludes productivity of
financial and noncorporate businesses, which probably is more
difficult to measure accurately.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector in the
third quarter was also revised down--from an annual rate of
3.9 percent to 3.4 percent. During the past four quarters,
compensation per hour increased 3.7 percent, up a bit from
3. The revisions to productivity and compensation per hour in
1995 incorporate the results of the 1995 Hours at Work Survey (HWS).
BLS uses this survey to adjust hours for which private nonfarm
employees are paid (reported in the BLS Current Establishment
Survey) to hours at the workplace. The latest HWS indicated that
hours at work grew more than previously estimated. Hours in
manufacturing largely were unaffected by these revisions.

3.5 percent during the year-earlier period. Compensation per hour
in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose 4.1 percent at an annual
rate in the third quarter and 3.7 percent over the past four
quarters.
Industrial Production
According to production-worker hours and available physical
product data, industrial production increased sharply in November.
A large increase in motor vehicle assemblies and related activity
after the production disruptions in October paced the advance; a
surge in utilities output also contributed importantly.4
Motor vehicle assemblies rebounded to an annual rate of
12.1 million units in November, with increases for both autos and
trucks. The assembly pace was somewhat below that scheduled at the
beginning of the month, in part because GM did not come back from
the strike as quickly as it had anticipated. GM also continues to
be plagued by start-up problems with new models. Nonetheless, the
increase in total assemblies was large enough to make a direct
contribution of about 0.3 percentage point to the growth in
industrial production, and upstream industries likely added
0.2 percentage point. Schedules call for assemblies of 12.4 million
units at an annual rate in December and 12.6 million in the first
quarter of 1997.

Manufacturing production-worker hours excluding motor vehicles

with productivity gains and the available physical output data, they
suggest that output in manufacturing excluding motor vehicles and
parts grew moderately last month. The movements in hours varied

with each of the Big Three.

considerably across the major groups--they rose more than
0.5 percent in foods, tobacco, petroleum products, paper, furniture,
computers and semiconductors, but declined 0.5 percent or more in
apparel, rubber and plastics, printing and publishing, and stone,
clay and glass. Among industries with weekly physical output data
available, production of appliances and meat products increased,
while petroleum refining and the production of steel and wood
products decreased.
Other indicators of industrial activity are consistent with
sustained moderate output growth. In November, the National
Association of Purchasing Managers' index of new orders, which had
dropped in October, bounced back to the robust range experienced in
the second and third quarters; the production index jumped
similarly, and the index of vendor performance showed supplier
deliveries slightly slower than in October. Real adjusted durable
goods orders increased 2.7 percent in October after two sluggish
months. The Beige Book, the latest Dun & Bradstreet survey, and
business contacts maintained by Board staff corroborate the view
that industrial output is growing roughly in line with capacity
expansion.
The staff will publish the annual revision of IP, capacity,
capacity utilization, and industrial use of electrical power in
early January. IP, capacity, and capacity utilization revisions
will incorporate updated source data and feature a change in the
method of aggregating the indexes. From 1977 onward, the value-
added proportions used to weight individual series will be updated
annually, rather than quinquennially, and will be aggregated using a
Fisher formula rather than a linked-Laspeyres formula. The new
aggregation methods will lower growth of IP and capacity because a
smaller weight will be applied, on average, to the fast-growing
computer industry. Because operating rates in the computer industry
are above average, the smaller weight should slightly lower the
published manufacturing utilization rate.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of new light vehicles in November totaled 14.8 million
units at an annual rate, the same as in October and only slightly
below the average pace over the first nine months of the year. We
estimate that sales were held down about 300,000 units per month, on
average, in October and November because the strikes and start-up
problems at GM limited vehicle availability; GM's fleet sales

apparently absorbed much of the shortfall. November sales by firms
other than GM were up, on balance, led by gains at major Japanese
makers.
Relatively moderate price increases this year probably
contributed to the sustained strength in light vehicle sales. Two
factors--the dollar's strength relative to the yen and model
redesigns that reduced assembly costs--allowed Japanese producers to
restrain price increases without hurting profit margins. This
strategy seems to have forced Big Three producers to follow suit to
remain competitive. Indeed, prices of comparably equipped 1997
models for the Big Three are less than 2 percent higher than the
1996 models. In addition, incentives offered by makers in the
fourth quarter, though down from the first half, are estimated to be
little changed from the third quarter.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending appears to have picked up after a lackluster
performance in the third quarter. Available data suggest that real
outlays for goods in November were noticeably above their third-
quarter levels. Readings on consumer sentiment from the University
of Michigan and the Conference Board also continue to be quite
positive.
Total nominal retail sales fell 0.4 percent in November,
reflecting a sharp drop in sales at automotive dealers.5
Spending in the retail control category, which excludes sales at
automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 0.4
percent last month after increasing 0.5 percent in both September
and October. Within the retail control group in November, spending
at durable goods stores was up smartly; sales at nondurable stores
edged higher, with declines in sales at food, general merchandise,
and apparel stores more than offset by gains at gasoline stations
and "other nondurable goods" outlets. The retail sales data,
together with available information about prices and auto sales,
suggest that the November level of real consumer spending on goods
was 0.7 percent above its third-quarter average (not at an annual
rate).
5. Discrepancies between retail sales at automotive dealers and
unit sales of light vehicles are not uncommon. Differences can
result from a variety of factors, including variations in the
average expenditure per vehicle, sales of used cars, expenditures on
repairs, or measurement error--particularly in the noisy advance
estimates of retail sales.

Real spending on services rose 0.4 percent in October following
a relatively weak third quarter. Energy spending was up moderately
in October after posting a large decline in the third quarter
because of the unusually cool summer weather. Energy expenditures
probably rose further in November, with lower-than-normal
temperatures spurring demand for heat. Among nonenergy services,
spending increased moderately in most major categories in
October.6
The trends in income remain solid. Real disposable income rose
3 percent over the year ending in the third quarter. And although
real DPI dipped in October, the growth in aggregate hours and the
brisk rise in earnings provided a notable boost to overall income in
November.
Sluggish spending during the summer and early autumn, coupled
with robust growth in income, lifted the personal saving rate from
4-1/2 percent, on average, over the first half of the year to
5-1/4 percent, on average, from July through October. Moreover, the
available data suggest that the saving rate remained elevated in
November. The persistently higher saving rates since midyear in the
face of booming stock prices remain puzzling. Of course, saving
rates during the past couple of years are still vulnerable to
potentially substantial revisions.
If the saving rate increase were to hold up, however, several
other possibilities might explain recent behavior. One is that the
factors we have cited frequently as offsetting the effects of stock
market wealth--notably, the heavy debt-service burdens of some
households, the tightening of credit standards, and perhaps a
heightened awareness of the need to provide for retirement,
educational, and medical costs--are imparting more restraint on
spending than we had anticipated. A second possibility is that
shareholders are simply being cautious in spending out of what has
been a stunningly sharp increase in the value of their assets.
6. Spending on household operation services rebounded sharply in
October as net outlays on household insurance services reversed
their large September decline. BEA calculates net household
insurance services as the difference between estimated insurance
premiums and estimated insurance benefits paid. In September,
estimated insurance benefits paid surged as a result of Hurricane
Fran, depressing net household insurance services by $5.4 billion
(annual rate).

Housing
Single-family housing production softened noticeably in
September and October. Starts declined appreciably in September and
fell another 4-1/2 percent in October, to 1.07 million units, their
lowest level since mid-1995. Permit issuance for single-family
homes also decreased, confirming the recent weakening in this
sector.
New home sales dropped from their high summer level and moved
more in line with production and builders' assessment of sales. New
home sales fell sharply in September and October to their lowest
level since March. The latest survey of homebuilders indicates that
sales continued to sag in November. Existing home sales also
declined in October--for a fifth consecutive month--and now stand
about 6 percent below their recent second-quarter high.
While sales waned, financial market conditions for homebuying
improved. Mortgage rates have fallen about 75 basis points since
early September. Perhaps relatedly, applications for home purchase
financing (both new and existing) at mortgage bankers moved up
noticeably in early December, after drifting up ever so slightly
over the previous several months. Moreover, consumer appraisals of
homebuying conditions, as sampled by the Michigan survey, were quite
favorable in both October and November.
In the multifamily housing sector, starts dropped back to
300,000 units at an annual rate in October, more or less offsetting
the uptick in September and extending their yearlong seesaw pattern.
Construction in this sector continues to be damped by the rising
inventory of unoccupied units. Vacancy rates for apartments rose to
9-1/2 percent in the third quarter, 1/2 percentage point more than
the average reading during the previous two years.
Business Fixed Investment
After a blockbuster third quarter, the growth of real business
fixed investment appears to be slowing this quarter. In part, the
deceleration reflects a sharp drop in business purchases of motor
vehicles. In addition, shipments of nondefense capital goods were
little changed, on balance, in nominal terms during September and
October. On the other hand, nonresidential construction seems to be
increasing at a fairly robust rate. Moreover, anecdotal reports and
investment fundamentals remain consistent with continued growth of
capital spending.

October bookings for communications equipment posted their
biggest increase in six years, and shipments held steady at a high
level. Cellular providers reportedly are expanding coverage
rapidly, and demand for satellite services is apparently quite
strong. In contrast, shipments of office and computing equipment
dropped 3-1/2 percent in October. But this movement conflicts with
reports in the trade press that demand for computer equipment is
robust. Meanwhile, orders for other capital goods have tailed off
noticeably in recent months, and shipments of these goods dropped in
October.
Several developments point to a steep fall in transportation
equipment investment this quarter. As noted earlier, fleet sales of
light vehicles in October and November were depressed by GM's
production shortfalls; some drop was likely in any event because
third-quarter fleet sales were exceptionally high. In addition,
heavy truck sales have been moving sideways of late, ignoring
monthly volatility. Despite a decline in October, shipments of
complete aircraft have grown smartly thus far this year, though a
sizable fraction was shipped to foreign carriers. A number of
American carriers have recently placed large orders with Boeing,
improving the outlook for domestic deliveries over the next few
years.
Judging from October construction, fourth-quarter real outlays
for nonresidential structures appear to be maintaining the solid
growth recorded in the third quarter. Construction put in place
advanced briskly in the office, other commercial, institutional, and
industrial categories in October. Contracts dropped sharply in
October, but their trend remains in line with that of construction.
Among other indicators, commercial vacancy rates are about as low as
they have been in the past fifteen years. Bank examiners surveyed
by the FDIC report fairly strong price movements and are bullish
about future conditions. Finally, real estate investment trusts
have been quite successful this year at raising capital for
construction projects in equity markets, and other financing appears
amply available as well.
Drilling and mining activity edged down in the third quarter
and is roughly flat so far in the fourth quarter. Some industry
analysts have been predicting an acceleration in natural gas
drilling activity over the next few months, at least partly in

response to the recent uptrend in natural gas prices. But there is
little evidence that such a surge is under way.
Business Inventories
Businesses entered the fourth quarter without discernible
inventory imbalances, and inventory-sales ratios for most types of
businesses were well within their recent ranges. Partial data
indicate little change in the underlying inventory situation in
October.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at a $14.5 billion annual rate
(book value) in October, a pace similar to the third-quarter rate.
Inventory investment was spread about evenly between durable and
nondurable goods industries. About half of the October accumulation
was in stocks of nondefense capital goods, notably nondefense
aircraft and construction machinery; stocks of communications
equipment posted a surprisingly small increase in light of soaring
new orders. Investment in stocks of non-auto consumer goods--
household durables, home goods, and apparel--slowed from the
previous two months. Most manufacturing inventory-shipments ratios
remained near their lowest points in recent years.
In wholesale trade, non-auto inventories expanded in October
for the first time since April. Part of the increase resulted from
higher stocks of farm products, which followed--but did not fully
offset--a string of sharp declines in preceding months. Production
information from the Agriculture Department suggests that some crop
harvests (corn and soybeans in particular) were late this year.
This delay may have led to drawdowns in stocks at many grain
elevators and other wholesale grain distributors during the summer.
As the harvest picked up momentum, stocks of wholesale farm products
turned up sharply in October, reversing some of the previous
declines. Aside from farm products, there was also a sizable
buildup in petroleum inventories at the wholesale level; the
increase likely reflected, in part, petroleum marketers' efforts to
replenish their unseasonably low heating oil stocks. Elsewhere in
wholesale trade, stocks of machinery and business equipment were
drawn down in October, while inventories of most types of consumer
goods, outside of motor vehicles, rose moderately.
October figures on retail inventories will be published
tomorrow. Non-auto inventories posted a sizable increase in the
third quarter, and the retail inventory-sales ratio moved back up to

the middle of its recent range after having fallen appreciably
during the first half of the year.
Government Sector
The federal government recorded a deficit of $40 billion in the
unified budget in October, the first month of fiscal 1997. The
deficit was nearly $18 billion larger than that recorded in October
1995, but outlays in October 1995 were depressed considerably by
special factors. First, because October 1, 1995, fell on a weekend,
about $7 billion of spending was moved into September. Second, in
the absence of enacted appropriations, outlays for defense and a
variety of nondefense programs were held down by a restrictive
continuing resolution. Among other things, the resolution delayed
disbursement of $3 billion in foreign assistance to Israel that is
normally made in October. In addition, more than $1 billion of
housing assistance payments scheduled for October 1995 were made in
the previous month, apparently because HUD mistakenly thought the
payments would be affected by a debt ceiling problem. The increase
in the deficit between October 1995 and October 1996 was also
swollen by a 14 percent rise in spending on Medicaid and Medicare.
Although few analysts expect the unusually favorable developments
seen in Medicaid during fiscal 1996 to be repeated, health outlays
are volatile from month to month, and the latest reading clearly
overstates the underlying trend. Receipts rose 4-1/2 percent
between October 1995 and October 1996, about in line with the pace
of income growth.
In the state and local sector, spending in the current quarter
is likely to receive a considerable lift from a surge in
construction outlays, which jumped 3-1/4 percent in real terms in
October to a level 5 percent (not at an annual rate) above the
third-quarter average. In contrast, state and local employment has
edged down in recent months, and the average level of employment in
October and November was about 25,000 below the third-quarter level.
In part, the recent weakness in employment may reflect the
difficulties in seasonally adjusting the data for this sector; so
far this year, employment growth has averaged 18,000 per month, a
bit more than the average monthly rise in 1995.
According to the National Association of State Budget Officers
(NASBO), states have budgeted relatively small increases in general
fund outlays for fiscal 1997, which ends on June 30 for most states.
Indeed, they project a rise in real spending of only about

1-1/2 percent--an unusually slow rate for a nonrecessionary year.
NASBO indicated that spending on certain big-ticket items--salaries,
welfare, and medical transfers--would grow only moderately. But the
association also reported that many states have taken actions to aid
local governments, including increases in grants, elimination of
mandates, and the takeover of specific local government functions.
For example, Connecticut will gradually assume responsibility for
the local welfare general assistance program, and Wisconsin will
provide funding for a substantially greater share of local education
expenditures in fiscal 1997 than it did in 1996.
Prices
The incoming data on core consumer price inflation have
remained favorable, as the CPI excluding food and energy rose a
modest 0.2 percent in both October and November. However, another
sizable rise in energy prices boosted the increase in the overall
CPI to 0.3 percent in these months.
The CPI for energy rose 1.2 percent in November after
increasing 0.7 percent in October. Gasoline prices were up
1.8 percent last month, as refiners were able to boost their margins
from October's very low levels. But marketers' margins remained
very low, and we anticipate another month or two of outsized
increases in consumer gasoline prices. Heating oil prices were up
another 2 percent in November, following two months of larger
increases. Although refiners have been able to boost inventories a
little bit in recent weeks, these stocks remain about 10 percent
below year-earlier levels. As such, heating oil prices probably
will remain sensitive to speculation about this winter's weather.
In addition, natural gas prices jumped in November, as steady
increases in spot prices since late October were passed through to
the consumer unusually rapidly.
After several months of larger increases, consumer food prices
were up 0.3 percent in November. The sharp decline in grain prices
since midsummer has now begun to show through to smaller increases
in prices of dairy products, meats, poultry, and eggs. Prices of
fresh fruits and vegetables--volatile in the best of times--were up
only modestly in November. At earlier stages of processing, the PPI
for crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs declined for a fourth month in
November, pointing to continued favorable consumer food price
developments in the coming months.

Core inflation remained tame in November: Prices of new
vehicles edged off 0.1 percent and are up less than 2 percent from a
year earlier. Non-energy service prices were up a modest
0.2 percent in November, a tad below their recent average. Even
though apparel prices rose 1/2 percent for a third month in
November, this followed a string of negative readings.
Prices of spot commodities have been mixed in recent weeks.
The Journal of Commerce industrial materials index is up about
2 percent since the last Greenbook but remains below its year-ago
level. Many farm commodity prices have moved up recently from their
seasonal lows around harvest time. Prices of copper and aluminum
have increased of late, but steel scrap prices have continued to
fall, reflecting weak export demand. In addition, prices of lumber
and plywood have come down a little from their very high levels
earlier in the fall. The PPI for crude materials less food and
energy edged down in November and stands 6-1/2 percent below its
year-earlier level; the index for intermediate materials excluding
food and energy has been about unchanged since the spring.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
For the most part, data released in the latter half of November
reinforced market participants' beliefs that the economy had
downshifted in the second half and that inflationary pressures
remain subdued. Interest rates moved substantially lower,
especially at intermediate and long-term maturities. The bond
markets have fluctuated in the past week, slumping when the
Chairman's comments about asset valuation created concern over a
possible System tightening, rallying on the report of slower
employment growth and higher joblessness in November, and then
falling again on concerns about weakness in the dollar and a
possible lessening of foreign capital inflows. On net, short-term
rates are slightly lower than at the time of the November FOMC
meeting while intermediate and long-term rates are somewhat
higher. Current quotes on federal funds and Eurodollar futures
contracts suggest an expectation that monetary policy will be on
hold for at least the near term.
The market anticipation of moderate growth, low inflation, and
stable interest rates propelled stock prices to new records during
the intermeeting period. Although the stock market dipped following
the Chairman's comments, it recovered quickly, more than gaining
back its losses by the end of the next trading day. Further
volatility this week has trimmed prices on net, but major indexes
are still up 1 to 4 percent from their closing levels on November
13.
Overall credit growth appears to have remained moderate this
quarter. Businesses have continued to take advantage of relatively
low long-term rates by issuing bonds while cutting back on the use
of commercial paper. Bank loans to businesses have expanded
briskly. In the household sector, consumer credit turned back up in
October, after a slight decline in September, but bank figures
suggest only continued slow growth last month. Information on home
mortgage flows this quarter is sparse, but available indicators
1. One exception to the general direction of short-term rates is
the one-month rate, which built in a year-end premium estimated to
be in excess of 2 percentage points when that maturity crossed over
into the new year. Year-end funding pressures are on par with those
of recent years, even though the last day of the year coincides with
the end of a reserve maintenance period--a situation that in
previous years has resulted in additional pressures.

suggest that demand for home loans has been buoyed by declining
interest rates.
Growth of M3 was substantial in October and November, with a
faster expansion of bank credit. M2 increased relatively slowly in
October, but picked up in November and generally has remained on a
trend paralleling nominal GDP.
Business Finance
The decline of long-term interest rates over most of the
intermeeting period spurred robust bond offerings by nonfinancial
corporations in November (table). Speculative grade issuance was
heavy, as it has been for most of the year; these issues have
accounted for nearly half of all bond offerings in 1996, up from
their roughly one-third share in 1994 and 1995. Nonfinancial
commercial paper, meanwhile, continued to decline in November as
issuers moved to lock in lower long-term rates (chart). In the
current economic and financial environment, the indicators of credit
quality of nonfinancial corporations have changed little in recent
months, with the value of nonfinancial debt upgraded by Moody's in
October and November about equal to the value downgraded.
Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms in November offered a
mixed picture. Seasoned issuance showed continued strength, while
initial public offerings fell after surging in October when many of
the companies that had registered to issue shares earlier this year
finally came to market (table). The market for IPOs has been less
buoyant of late; for example, the first-day price increases for IPOs
dropped back to a shade above 10 percent (on average) in October and
November from already moderate third-quarter levels (chart). Equity
retirements, meanwhile, continue apace: share repurchases remain
very strong, while there is no indication that merger activity is
slowing.
The S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio (based on analysts'
estimates of earnings over the coming twelve months) has risen to
new highs for this series that began in 1979 (chart). The runup in
the P/E ratio is broadly consistent over longer periods with changes
in long-term interest rates--this indicator of stock market
valuation tends to reach its highs as long-term rates reach their
lows (chart). Still, the high valuation at present comes amid
indications of a slowdown in corporate earnings growth. Third-
quarter earnings of firms in the S&P 500 were up 8 percent from four
quarters earlier, the slowest rate of growth in five years (chart).

In the midst of the rapid increase in equity prices, net
inflows to equity funds were up in November from their October
levels but remained well below those of the first half of the year
(table). Preliminary data for the week ending December 4 suggest
that equity funds actually experienced a net outflow, for the first
time since mid-July: however, industry sources indicate that there
was not much investor reaction to the December 6 volatility in stock
prices. The mix of inflows since midyear has had a slightly more
conservative cast, with growth and income funds--which tend to
invest in large, dividend-paying companies--accounting for about
half of domestic equity net sales, up from about 40 percent over the
first half. Cash ratios for stock funds declined to a historical
low of 6.2 percent by the end of October, as the bull market
continued to punish managers who did not try to stay fully invested.

Household Finance
Total consumer credit expanded about 2-1/4 percent, at an
annual rate, in October following the small decline recorded in
September (table). The sluggish growth in September and October
confirms a substantial further slowing in consumer credit from its
pace early in the year. Revolving credit grew at less than a
5 percent annual rate for the second straight month, well below the
15 percent growth averaged in the first half of this year.
Partial data for bank credit and mortgage-backed securities
issuance so far in the current quarter suggest that mortgage
borrowing has continued at about the same moderate pace as that
recorded in the third quarter. Mortgage applications for home
purchases have remained at a relatively high level, buoyed by the
lower mortgage interest rates that prevailed for most of the
intermeeting period. The decline in mortgage interest rates also
more noticeably spurred refinancing activity, and the Mortgage
Bankers Association's refi index in late November reached the
highest level (seasonally adjusted) since early May. However, the
refi index remains well off the peak reached in February.
Thirty-year, fixed-rate loans have been the most popular type
of new mortgage among refinancers, irrespective of the type of
mortgage they originally owed. With mortgage rates hovering around
7-1/2 percent, about one-fifth of all outstanding fixed-rate loans
could be considered likely candidates for refinancing. The
potential net interest savings to homeowners is likely to be smaller
than in earlier refinancing episodes because the average note rate
on the outstanding stock of loans is much lower today than it was at
the beginning of 1992 and because a large portion of the refinancing
wave thus far has entailed shifting from ARMs to FRMs.
Lower mortgage rates and the associated reduction in payment
burdens will likely help to sustain relatively strong mortgage
payment performance. Recent reports indicate that the delinquency
rate for mortgages edged lower in the third quarter. According to
seasonally adjusted data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the
thirty-day delinquency rate on single-family loans declined for the
second consecutive quarter (chart). The number of single-family
loans sixty days or more past due, a measure of more serious payment
problems, also declined, dropping this delinquency rate to a level
last seen in 1979. And at banks, Call Reports for the third quarter
continue to show very low levels of delinquencies and charge-offs.

However, indicators of credit quality of consumer loans suggest
a more marked deterioration in household financial health (chart,
middle and lower panels). Call Report data indicate that consumer
loan delinquencies at banks continued to rise in the third quarter:
Credit card delinquencies increased to 4.49 percent last quarter,
the highest level reported for this series that began in the first
quarter of 1992. Delinquency rates on other consumer loans also
moved higher but remained well below prior peaks. Despite the
deteriorating credit quality of consumer loans, bank profitability
remained quite strong according to third-quarter Call Reports, even
at credit card banks. Indeed, these banks have maintained a high
ratio of loan loss reserves to delinquent loans and remain well
capitalized.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
The growth of M2 strengthened last month to a 7-1/4 percent
rate, more than double its rate in October. The reasons for the
surge in growth are not clear at this time, but November's robust
expansion follows two months of slowing growth, and averaging
through the monthly gyrations, M2 continues to expand at about a
4-1/4 percent pace. Its growth for the entire year places it in the
upper half of its annual range.
At 6-3/4 percent, M3 growth eased from its brisk October pace
and remained just above the upper bound of its 2-to-6 percent range.
Deceleration in M3 growth in November was accompanied by a slowing
of bank credit growth. After adjusting for mark-to-market
accounting effects, bank credit grew at an annual rate of
5-1/4 percent. The slowing in bank credit owed to a drop-off in
loan growth to a 4 percent rate, less than half the pace of the
previous two months, as business loans and the volatile "other
loans" category decelerated.
Business loan growth eased off its extraordinarily rapid pace
in September and October but to a still brisk 7 percent rate in
November. Both delinquency and charge-off rates for business loans
continued to be low in the third quarter (chart), and there are no
signs that banks have become less accommodative lenders. Spreads on
both large and small business loans were essentially unchanged in
November from three months earlier, according to the November Survey
of Terms of Bank Lending (chart). For large loans, these spreads
remain quite narrow by standards of the past fifteen years.

In contrast, consumer lending remained sluggish in part as
banks appeared to have become more cautious in the face of rising
debt burden problems. After gaining 10 percent at an annual rate
between July and September, outstanding consumer loans at banks,
adjusted for securitization, showed only small increases in October
and November. Anecdotal reports suggested that some banks are
steering customers away from consumer loans toward home equity
lines, thus providing lenders with better collateral. While home
equity loans expanded rapidly, overall real estate loans increased
at a modest 4-1/2 percent pace in November.
Treasury and Agency Financing
The staff anticipates that the Treasury will finance the
projected $59 billion fourth-quarter deficit by borrowing
$43 billion from the public and by drawing down its cash balance by
$13 billion. The Treasury has relied more heavily this quarter on
coupon issues than in previous quarters, adding an extra ten-year
note auction in mid-October and including a long-term bond in the
November midquarter refunding for the first time since 1992. In
total, fourth-quarter auctions of coupons are expected to raise
$24 billion, while proceeds from bill auctions are expected to
contribute only $12 billion. The Treasury still intends to auction
an "inflation protection" note for settlement in mid-January.
Recently, considerable market attention has focused on reports
of the heavy acquisition of Treasury securities by foreign
purchasers. Foreign holdings of Treasuries have risen sharply in
the past few years, with foreign entities estimated to hold almost
30 percent of outstanding Treasury securities at the end of the
third quarter (chart). Nearly half of the increase can be
attributed to purchases by official institutions, which tend to hold
their securities in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
(chart). Recently, custodial holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York have topped $600 billion.
Issuance of securities by government-sponsored enterprises has
remained steady; and spreads of GSE-issued securities over
comparable Treasury securities are essentially unchanged at about
16 basis points for the five-year note and 25 basis points for the
ten-year note.

Totaling about $12-1/2 billion, gross offerings of long-term
municipal debt in November were down from October, with the decline
attributable to weaker issuance for new capital (table). Data for
the first week of December, however, show a pickup in gross

The yield ratio of long-term tax-exempt bonds to comparable
Treasuries increased to 0.84 in November from 0.82 in October.
Analysts attributed the increase in the yield ratio, in part, to
weak retail demand for tax-exempt debt in the first three weeks of
the month, which may have stemmed from the strong performance of the
stock market. More recently, though, there have been some reports
that investors, such as property and casualty insurance companies,
have stepped into the municipal market at what they view as
attractive yields.

APPENDIX
REVIEW OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN 1996
Summary
Most broad money and credit aggregates have expanded moderately
in 1996, at rates roughly in line with growth in nominal income.
Total domestic nonfinancial debt is projected to come in near the
middle of its monitoring range, with both the federal and nonfederal
components decelerating a little from the previous year. More
noticeable has been the slowing in depository credit--a weakening in
bank credit growth offset only partially by a pickup in the
expansion of thrift credit--as a larger share of borrowing has been
financed in securities markets. Despite the stimulus early in the
year from System policy easings, M2 growth has been a little below
that of nominal GDP, but M2 is expected to finish the year in the
upper half of its annual range. M3 has expanded somewhat faster
than other broad money and credit measures as banks have shifted
their funding toward large time deposits (and other managed
liabilities in M3) and away from borrowing from their foreign
offices. M3 is expected to end the year a little above its annual
range.
Domestic Nonfinancial Debt
Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at a 5 percent pace
through November--a bit slower than in 1995 but near the middle of
its annual range. The deceleration in debt growth has been evident
in both its federal and nonfederal components.
The Treasury's borrowing needs have been modest in 1996,
reflecting both slower growth in outlays and strong receipts.
Unexpected strength in Treasury tax receipts evidently stemmed
largely from a jump in revenue from capital gains taxes associated
with the stock market rally over 1995. Federal debt has expanded at
about a 3-3/4 percent pace through November--down about 3/4
percentage point from the previous year and the slowest rate of
expansion since 1974.
Nonfederal debt has expanded at about a 5-1/2 percent pace
through November--a touch below that of 1995. State and local
governments have continued to pay down tax-exempt debt on net as
gross issuance has again fallen short of retirements of advance-
refunded debt. Early in the political campaign season, yields on
municipal securities were temporarily elevated relative to
comparable Treasury yields amid the debate over "flat-tax" proposals
that would have reduced or eliminated the federal tax exemption for
state and local securities. Since then, the ratio of municipal bond
yields to Treasury yields has drifted down to more normal levels.
Business Finance. Despite heavy investment expenditures,
businesses have increased their debt at only a moderate rate during
the year. To a large extent, strong profits have enabled businesses
to rely on internal funds in financing new investment projects.
Standard measures of financial stress in the business sector--such
as net interest outlays relative to cash flow, the number of
business failures, and the dollar value of corporate debt upgraded
by major rating agencies--have all been quite favorable. Given the
evident health of the business sector and the generally favorable
III-A-1

III-A-2
outlook for the economy, capital markets have remained quite
receptive to new offerings of corporate securities. Spreads on
investment-grade bonds and commercial paper and also junk bonds
relative to comparable Treasuries have remained quite narrow. Banks
also have been quite eager to extend new business credits.
The commercial real estate market has continued its gradual
recovery, contributing to the modest rise in commercial mortgage
debt this year. Much of the debt financing for commercial real
estate has been packaged in the form of mortgage-backed securities.
Household Finance. Consumer credit continued to expand briskly
through the first few months of the year--albeit at a pace below
that in 1995. However, consumer credit growth has slowed markedly
in recent months, perhaps indicating some response by households to
financial strains that have been evident over the year. Personal
bankruptcies have climbed sharply, although some of the increase is
likely attributable to recent changes in the bankruptcy code that
have made declaring bankruptcy less onerous as well as the growing
acceptability of declaring bankruptcy as a remedy for financial
problems. Credit card delinquencies--as measured from bank Call
Reports--have risen steadily during the year but have remained
below the highs recorded in the early 1990s. Charge-off rates on
credit card loans at banks have also risen through the year.
reaching a level in the third quarter just below the previous peak
attained in early 1992.
Consistent with the strength in home sales over much of the
year, growth in home mortgage credit appears to have picked up to
its most rapid pace since 1990. In contrast to consumer loans, most
measures of delinquency rates on home mortgages have remained near
the lower end of their historical ranges throughout the year.
Depository Credit
Depository credit growth has slowed considerably this year
relative to 1995, with an appreciable deceleration in bank credit
offset partly by stronger growth in thrift credit. Bank credit
(adjusted for the impact of mark-to-market accounting rules)
expanded through November at about a 4-1/2 percent rate--the slowest
pace since 1992 and one that implies a slight decline in the share
of total domestic nonfinancial credit flows funded by banks. Bank
securities portfolios--adjusted for the effect of mark-to-market
accounting rules--expanded slightly through November. Bank loans
have grown moderately in 1996 but at a rate substantially below that
of the previous two years.
The deceleration in bank loans has been apparent in nearly all
major lending categories. In part, slower growth in bank loans
reflects market conditions that have favored securitization. For
example, with long-term interest rates quite low over much of the
year, borrowers have tended to favor fixed-rate mortgages which, in
turn, tend to be securitized. In addition, banks have moved a large
volume of credit card receivables off their books in response to
strong market demand for asset-backed securities.
Still, even apart from the effects of securitization, bank loan
growth has moderated. Banks' lending to business--while still
registering solid growth--has been more subdued than in the past two
years. Businesses' greater reliance on internal funds and also
their reduced inventory financing needs evidently have held down

III-A-3
their bank borrowing, despite aggressive competition by banks for
business customers. Delinquencies and charge-offs on business loans
have remained at historically low levels, and surveys of senior loan
officers throughout the year showed that banks had eased the terms
and standards applied to business loans. However, data on loan
rates charged by banks suggest that spreads of bank loan rates over
market interest rates have changed little on balance over the year.
In contrast, banks have become considerably more cautious in
lending to consumers. Delinquency rates on consumer loans have
climbed significantly over the year. Survey evidence and anecdotal
information suggest that many banks conducting aggressive credit
card campaigns had allowed for some increase in delinquency rates
and other loan performance problems. In the event, however, such
loan performance problems appeared to be larger than anticipated.
Indeed, surveys of senior loan officers indicate that many banks
have tightened the terms and standards applied to consumer loans.
Despite the increase in consumer loan performance problems at banks,
the vast majority of banks have reported strong profits and capital
positions. Even credit card banks continue to report healthy
earnings.
The outlook in the thrift industry has also been improving.
After several years of debate, the Congress recapitalized the
Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) with a special assessment
of 66 basis points on SAIF deposits. The special assessment was
booked in the third quarter and hence depressed the third-quarter
profits of thrifts (and also of banks that had acquired SAIF
deposits through mergers and acquisitions). Apart from the special
assessment, thrift profits have been quite strong this year, and
growth of thrift credit has picked up considerably.
Monetary Aggregates
Despite slower growth of depository credit this year, M3 has
advanced briskly--expanding at a 6-1/4 percent pace from the fourth
quarter of 1995 through November--and will likely end the year a
little above the upper bound of its annual range. Reductions in
deposit insurance premiums for most banks late in 1995 have likely
helped to bolster M3 growth this year. In the previous two years,
domestic banks had substantially increased borrowing from their
offices abroad. In part, this funding strategy appeared designed to
avoid the rather high deposit insurance premiums then in effect. By
contrast, domestically chartered banks have reduced their borrowing
from foreign offices in 1996 in favor of greater reliance on large
time deposits and other managed liabilities that are included in M3.
M3 has also been lifted by strong growth of money funds.
The strength in M3 over the year has not been matched by M2.
From the fourth quarter of 1995 through November, M2 expanded at a
4-1/4 percent annual pace, placing it in the upper half of its
annual range. Early in the year, M2 growth was quite robust.
Returns on M2 assets became more attractive relative to yields on
short-term money market instruments following the System policy
easings in December 1995 and January 1996. In addition, the steep
decline in long-term interest rates toward the end of 1995 sparked
another round of home mortgage refinancings, and the associated
prepayments on mortgage-backed securities helped fuel a notable rise
in demand deposits over the first few months of the year. In later
months, however, the advance in M2 moderated as demand deposit
growth ebbed and growth in other accounts at depository institutions

III-A-4
turned sluggish. Indeed, from March through November, deposits in
M2 climbed only 1 percent at an annual rate.
In part, the tepid expansion of M2 deposits may have been a
consequence of relatively attractive rates of return on alternative
assets. Returns on bank and thrift deposits have certainly been no
match for the realized returns on stocks over the year and have not
been very competitive even with yields on money market mutual funds.
From March through November, retail money funds increased at an
11-1/2 percent pace and accounted for more than half of the overall
increase in M2 over the same period.
The transaction components of M2 have been dominated by special
factors throughout the year. Through November, new retail sweep
arrangements implemented during the year are estimated to have cut
the level of other checkable deposits (OCDs) by more than $100
billion. In addition, a few large institutions have established so-
called "weekend" sweeps of demand deposit accounts--arrangements in
which demand deposit balances are swept into MMDA accounts over the
weekend. While less widespread than OCD sweeps, new demand deposit
sweeps depressed the growth of these accounts significantly in the
third quarter.
With transaction deposits shrinking on balance through the
year, required reserves have remained on a rather steep downward
trajectory. The monetary base nonetheless has managed a little
growth over the year, buoyed by a rise in currency. Currency
decelerated early in the year; shipments of U.S. currency abroad had
slowed from the pace of the previous year, and demand for the new
$100 bill introduced in March initially fell short of expectations.
However, subsequently, foreign shipments of U.S. currency picked up
amid political and economic uncertainties in Russia that boosted the
demand for dollars there.

In September, the U.S. deficit in trade in goods and services
was somewhat larger than in August and close to the level reported
for July. Exports declined slightly in September from their August
level, while imports were about unchanged. In the third quarter,
the deficit was significantly larger than in the second quarter or
in any quarter in recent years.

Exports of goods and services were 1-1/2 percent lower in the
third quarter compared with the second quarter, with virtually all
of the decrease attributable to aircraft and gold. Automotive
exports rose somewhat (especially passenger cars to Europe and
Japan). Other major categories of exports were little changed from
levels recorded in the second quarter. Exports to Western Europe
declined sharply, mostly due to declines in aircraft and gold and
more than accounted for the overall drop in total merchandise
exports. A pickup in exports to Latin America partly offset the
decline to other areas.
Imports of goods and services were only slightly higher in the
third quarter than in the second quarter. Declines in imported gold
and semiconductors almost offset increases in most other major trade
categories. The largest increases were in consumer goods (with 40
percent of the rise from China) and automotive products (parts from
Canada and vehicles from Japan).

Oil Imports
The quantity of oil imported rose 7.0 percent (SAAR) during
the third quarter -- an increase of 0.166 mb/d. Imports were
boosted by strong consumption, which was only partially offset by a
0.117 mb/d drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Preliminary
data from the Department of Energy indicate that oil imports in
October and November remained near the third-quarter pace, as
increased production and a drawdown in stocks nearly offset stronger
oil consumption.
Oil Prices
While the price of imported oil increased about 2 percent in
July and August and jumped another 7.4 percent in September, the
third-quarter average was nearly the same as the second-quarter
level, owing to a very high April level and substantial price
declines in May and June. The price of imported oil rose again in
October and was 37 percent above its October 1995 level. Spot WTI
has been quite volatile in the fourth quarter. WTI rose $0.90 per
barrel in October, in part, on skirmishes in the Kurdish region of
Northern Iraq and concerns over the level of heating oil stocks in
the United States and Europe. The announcement of an agreement
between the United Nations and Iraq on all technical issues
regarding Iraq's limited oil sale helped push down the November spot
price $1.20 per barrel, as well as prices for future delivery.
Prices firmed in early December, owing to strikes in France that
interrupted refinery operations. Spot WTI has declined substan-
tially, however, since Iraq commenced producing oil for export on
December 9. Spot WTI is trading in the $23-24 per barrel range.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased 3 percent during the
third quarter, a bit more than the BLS recorded declines in the
first and second quarters. Prices of imported computers,
semiconductors, and industrial supplies continued to fall sharply.
Prices of imported foods also fell in the third quarter, nearly
reversing a substantial increase in the second quarter. In October,
prices of non-oil imports declined further; decreases were recorded
in all major trade categories except foods (which rose slightly).
Prices of exports also fell in the third quarter. While the
bulk of the decline was due to rapidly falling agricultural prices

(especially grains), prices of nonagricultural exports also fell, on
balance, with the largest declines in prices of computers and
semiconductors. There were small increases in prices of exported
consumer goods, automotive products, and capital goods (other than
computers and semiconductors). In October, the drop in export
prices of agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors more
than offset small increases in prices of other export categories.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current-account deficit widened $31 billion SAAR in
the third quarter. Larger deficits on net goods and services and
net investment income accounted for the increase.
The deficit in net investment income widened $10 billion SAAR
in the third quarter. Income receipts on assets abroad edged up
(primarily private portfolio receipts). Income payments on foreign
assets in the United States increased $11 billion SAAR. U.S.
Government payments rose strongly, reflecting substantial foreign
acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities in recent quarters. Direct
investment payments also rose strongly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Much of the recorded net capital inflow in October was
accounted for by net increases in private holdings of U.S.
securities. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.) Private foreign net purchases of U.S. Treasury
bonds were very large in October (line 4a). The United Kingdom and
Japan accounted for most of these recorded net purchases. In
contrast to earlier in the year, the net change in holdings of
Treasury securities by financial institutions located in the
Caribbean was small. Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate and
government agency bonds were also strong in October (line 4b). Both
U.S. corporations and government agencies have actively tapped the
Eurobond markets in recent months. Foreign investors only added
modestly to their holdings of U.S. corporate stock in October
(line 4c).
U.S. interest in foreign bonds also remained strong in October
(line 5a). While the bulk of the net purchases were made in Europe,
it is notable that Russia and certain developing countries in Latin
America have successfully raised funds in international bond markets
in recent months and attracted U.S. investors. U.S. net purchases
of foreign stocks continued to be relatively small in October
compared with the first half of the year.
Foreign official assets in the United States rose only a few
billion dollars in October (line 1). However, during the first 10
months of 1996, foreign official assets in the United States
increased by over $90 billion, and partial information from the
FRBNY suggests another large increase in November. The increase in
official holdings in 1996 seems likely to match the record increase
of 1995. As in 1995, only part of the increase in 1996 reflects
foreign exchange market intervention by the other G-10 countries.
In the first 10 months of 1996, the G-10 countries accounted for
less than 40 percent of the increase in official holdings in the
United States; in 1995 the G-10 share of the increase was even
lower, about 30 percent.
Banks reported a net inflow in October on a month-end basis,
reversing only in small part the large capital outflows recorded
since the end of 1995 (line 3). On a monthly-average basis net
outflows from banks to their own foreign offices and IBFs have also

been substantial for 1996 as a whole. (See line 1 of the
International Banking Data table.) These outflows coincided with a
slowing in the growth of bank credit and growing reliance on large
time deposits, perhaps spurred in part by a reduction in deposit
insurance premiums in late 1995.
Recently released data on direct investment capital flows for
the third quarter indicate continued strength in foreign direct
investment in the United States. (See line 7 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) In contrast, U.S. direct
investment abroad fell sharply (line 6). However, the weakness in
U.S. direct investment abroad was largely attributable to large
shifts in intercompany debt between U.S. parents and finance
affiliates in the United Kingdom; these intercompany accounts are
highly volatile. The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. inter-
national transactions accounts for the third quarter was large and
negative, indicating omitted net payments or capital outflows. The
statistical discrepancy would have been even more negative if
estimated net increases in foreign holdings of U.S. paper currency
had been included in the accounts.
Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets
Since the November meeting of the FOMC, the G-10 weighted
average of the dollar has appreciated about 2 percent. The dollar
is up somewhat more, on average, against core European currencies in
the wake of calls by officials in a number of those countries for a
stronger dollar. The dollar rose about 1-1/2 percent against the yen
as market participants appear to have concluded that there is little
prospect for an increase in official Japanese interest rates anytime
soon. The dollar is up somewhat less relative to sterling and the
Italian lira. The latter currency has benefited from its re-entry
to the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS on November 24, while
sterling has benefited from new evidence of healthy economic growth.
Stock prices are mixed, on balance, since the last FOMC
meeting in spite of sharp declines over the last week. Japanese
stocks are down about 3 percent from their November 13 level.
British stock prices are down about 1/2 percent over the inter-
meeting period, while other major European markets are up between
1/2 and 3 percent, on balance.

Yields on ten-year foreign government bonds are little
changed, on average, since the last FOMC meeting. Early in the
intermeeting period foreign long-term interest rates declined by
about 1/4 percentage point on average. But those declines have been
largely reversed in volatile trading over the last week. Yields on
long-term bonds increased 10 to 60 basis points in other major
markets between last Wednesday's close and their high-point on
Friday. Bond prices subsequently recovered on Monday and Tuesday,
but fell again on Wednesday.
A number of factors account for the superior performance of
foreign bond markets, relative to U.S. markets, since the November
FOMC. Japanese interest rates fell, and the yen depreciated,
following the release of the October Tankan and other data in the
week of November 25. Market participants seem to have interpreted
these data as suggesting that there is little prospect of a
significant acceleration of Japanese economic activity in the near
future and therefore the Bank of Japan is unlikely to raise interest
rates soon.
Long-term interest rates in core European countries, including
Germany, may have been affected by the recent public debate over the
external value of the French franc. On November 20, former French
President Giscard d'Estaing called for a substantial devaluation of
the French franc in order to stimulate the French economy. These
comments touched off a lively debate among current and former
government officials. Public statements have focused on the
external value of the franc, particularly relative to the dollar,
but many comments favoring franc depreciation were implicitly
critical of current French and German monetary policy. A number of
prominent French and German officials, including Bank of France
Governor Trichet and French Finance Minister Arthuis, strongly
reaffirmed their commitment to the current franc/DM exchange rate.
But in responding to this debate German officials, including
Bundesbank President Tietmeyer, indicated that they are not opposed
to a stronger dollar. This, combined with weaker-than-expected
German industrial production data for October, raised the
possibility, in the minds of some market participants, of a more
accommodative German monetary policy.

IV-13
After protracted negotiations the Italian lira re-entered the
ERM on November 24 at a central parity of 990 lire/DM. The lira has
strengthened about 2 percent against the mark since mid-November
when rumors began to circulate that the lira's ERM re-entry was
imminent. Italian interest rates are little changed since the lira
re-entered the ERM. Both short and long-term rates had fallen
significantly in the week preceding the lira's re-entry as declining
inflation and the passage of a tight budget for 1997, including a
substantial tax increase, made it possible for the Bank of Italy to
ease monetary policy.
Bond market turmoil over the last week seemed to have the
greatest impact in Canada. In fact, Canadian bond prices began
falling well before those in other markets. Yields on Canadian
10-year government bonds increased 30 basis points last Thursday,
that is, the day of Chairman Greenspan's AEI speech. Yields
increased further on Friday morning but moved down thereafter.
Canadian long-term bond yields are now 30 basis points above where
they were at the last FOMC meeting. Over recent months, Canadian
bonds had been supported by declines in official interest rates.
Over the last few weeks, however, the Canadian dollar has
depreciated about 1-3/4 percent. Given the Bank of Canada's use of
its MCI as a guide to monetary policy, market participants appear to
have concluded that further declines in official rates are unlikely.
The dollar is little changed against sterling since the
November FOMC meeting. In the early intermeeting period sterling
appreciated significantly as new data seemed to indicate good growth
in the British economy and prospects for an increase in interest
rates seemed to be on the rise. But much of sterling's recent gains
were reversed last week after Chancellor Clarke noted that some
British exporters had expressed concerns about sterling's recent
appreciation and Bank of England Governor Eddie George said that
large increases in interest rates were not needed.
On a weighted-average basis foreign short-term interest rates
are little changed since the last FOMC. There are some significant
deviations from this general pattern, however. Short-term rates
are down significantly in both Italy and Sweden, as declining
inflation and other factors made it possible to ease monetary

IV-14
conditions. Short-term rates have moved up in both Canada and
Switzerland. In Canada's case this may reflect the market's
perception that monetary policy is now on hold after considerable
easing in previous months.
Swiss rates have edged up in recent weeks, apparently due to
an increase in banks' demand for central bank balances. But this
does not appear to reflect a change in Swiss monetary policy. On
December 9, the Vice President of the Swiss National Bank said that
the Bank was pleased with the recent depreciation of the Swiss
franc. Since the last FOMC meeting, the Swiss franc has depreciated
by 4 percent against the dollar and by more than 1 percent against
the mark.
Interest rates in Sweden continued to decline. The Riksbank
lowered its securities repurchase rate by 25 basis points on
November 26. This followed the release of better-than-expected
inflation data for October. Both short- and long-term- interest
rates have declined about 1/2 a percentage point since the November
FOMC meeting.
The Mexican peso has been relatively stable over the last four
weeks after depreciating 5 percent in October. The sharp increases
in Mexican interest rates during October, which were maintained
through November, helped to stabilize the peso. Declines in U.S.
long-term interest rates between mid-November and the middle of last
week also supported the peso, as did the release of stronger-than-
expected GDP data for the third quarter. With a stable peso
interest rates have come down somewhat in December. The rate on
91-day Cetes has come down about 3 percentage points over the last
four weeks.
The Desk did not intervene for U.S. monetary
authorities during the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in most of the major foreign industrial
countries picked up in the third quarter from the pace recorded in
the first half of this year. A notable exception was Japan where
real GDP grew a tepid 0.4 percent (SAAR), compared with 3.5 percent

IV-15
in the first half. In Canada and all the major European countries
but Italy output expanded at more than a 3 percent rate.
Available indicators for the fourth quarter generally suggest
a slower rate of growth in the major industrial countries. German
industrial production fell in October for the second consecutive
month, and French consumption of manufactured products dropped again
in October. In contrast, output appears to have picked up in Japan
following last quarter's weak activity; in October, Japanese
industrial production jumped 3.5 percent.
Labor market slack has contributed to subdued wage and price
pressures abroad: Recent twelve-month rates of consumer-price
inflation have been near zero in Japan and have averaged 1-1/2
percent to 1-3/4 percent in Germany, France, and Canada. Italian
consumer-price inflation continued its steep downward trend, falling
to 2-1/2 percent in November (from more than double that rate about
a year ago). In contrast, underlying inflation in the United
Kingdom was 3-1/4 percent in November, solidly above the
government's target rate.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GDP rose 0.4 percent
(SAAR) in the third quarter, after a downward revised 3.5 percent in
the first half. Strong growth in private nonresidential investment,
government consumption, and net exports was nearly offset by small
declines in private consumption and residential investment along
with large declines in public investment and inventory investment.
The Economic Planning Agency also released revised GDP data that
show slightly stronger growth for 1994 and 1995 than previously
estimated and slightly weaker growth in the first half of 1996.
Available fourth-quarter indicators point to renewed
expansion. Industrial production rose 3.5 percent in October, while
housing starts, machinery orders, and new car registrations also
grew at a robust pace. The ratio of job offers to job applicants
increased in October to its highest level in three years, and the
unemployment rate edged up as many workers quit their jobs in search
of better positions. The Bank of Japan's November survey (Tankan)
registered a modest improvement in business sentiment at major
manufacturers and confirmed the findings of the May and August
surveys that capital spending plans are improving. Consumer prices
remain stable, while the recent, modest depreciation of the yen

The newly installed minority government of Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto has announced plans to unveil a supplementary
budget for fiscal 1996 and an initial budget for fiscal 1997 in
December for consideration by the Diet in January. The cabinet
announced a headline figure of 4.8 trillion yen (about 1 percent of
GDP) for the supplemental budget, but details have yet to be
released, and it is not clear how much represents new spending as
opposed to a reallocation of previously authorized spending or new
loans. Members of the cabinet have indicated that they do not favor
extending the temporary income tax rebate into 1997 or boosting
public works spending significantly in the supplemental budget.
Prime Minister Hashimoto has declared his intention to pursue
financial-market reform in a number of areas. He has supported
proposals to grant more independence to the Bank of Japan; to remove
the authority of the Ministry of Finance to inspect and supervise
depository institutions; and to deregulate banks, insurance
companies, and securities firms in order to make Tokyo an
international financial market comparable to New York or London.
Real GDP in Germany advanced at a pace of 3.3 percent (SAAR)
in the third quarter due almost entirely to a surge in exports, as
domestic demand was little changed from its second-quarter level.
Construction spending increased at a moderate pace, while
expenditure on machinery and equipment was unchanged from its
second-quarter level. The contribution of inventories was negative
in both the second and third quarters, but the change in inventories
is a residual in the German accounts and is subject to substantial
revision.
Few indicators are available for the fourth quarter. Although
industrial production declined almost 2 percent in October, real
manufacturing orders rose nearly 3 percent owing to a surge in
orders from both domestic and foreign firms. The IFO business
climate survey, an indicator of current and expected conditions in
industry, showed continued improvement in October, particularly in
the expectations component of the index. Inflation remains subdued,
with consumer prices up 1.4 percent over the twelve months to
November.

scheduled for December 19. The Kohl government continues to
maintain that the overall fiscal package will be sufficient to
reduce the deficit to 2-1/2 percent of GDP in 1997 from more than 4
percent this year.
In France, real GDP grew 3.7 percent (SAAR) in the third
quarter of 1996, following a drop of 0.6 percent (revised from -1.4
percent) in the second quarter--exhibiting the same degree of
volatility that has characterized the quarterly pattern of GDP since
late last year. Part of the swing in growth between the second and
third quarters reflects the influence of working-day effects that
had reduced second-quarter growth. In addition, consumption surged
in the third quarter prior to the expiration of the "Juppette" car-
buying incentive program. Investment expanded after having declined
for three consecutive quarters, as business investment picked up.
An inventory drawdown reduced growth, while a strong rebound in
exports underpinned the positive contribution from net exports.

Economic activity in the fourth quarter is likely to be flat
or slightly negative owing to a smaller number of working days in
the quarter and weaker consumption. In October, consumption of
manufactured products registered a sharp decline led by a fall in
car purchases following the expiration of the "Juppette" subsidy.

IV-20
While consumer confidence rose slightly in October and November, its
continuing, low level largely reflects general discontent with the
government. Business surveys suggested that manufacturing output
declined in October and November. Inventories seem to have returned
to more normal levels, but there is likely to be further destocking
because firms expect the prices of intermediate materials to
decline. Unemployment, which rose to a new post-war high in
September, remained at 12.6 percent in October. Consumer-price
inflation in November remained moderate.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP moved up 3.1 percent (SAAR) in
the third quarter. Personal and government consumption expenditures
rose briskly, while fixed investment dropped following a bunching of
aircraft deliveries in the second quarter. Stock accumulation
contributed somewhat to growth following a substantial rundown in
the second quarter. The contribution of net exports has been
slightly negative on balance so far this year, following two years
of large positive contributions to growth.
Indicators for the fourth quarter are limited but appear to
show continued strength. After falling in September, retail sales
picked up in October. Industrial production edged down in October
as oil extraction, which is quite volatile, dropped. In contrast,
manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent. Surveys of consumer
confidence have shown increased optimism in recent months, with
confidence in November at its highest level since the late 1980s.

IV-21
Surveys of manufacturers continued to report strength in orders in
November, particularly for consumer goods, while recent surveys of
production plans edged back from their high third-quarter level.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.2 percent in October, its lowest
level since early 1991.

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 3.3
percent in November from a year earlier, solidly above the
government's target rate of 2-1/2 percent or less. This pickup,
however, reflects in large part the runup in oil prices this year.

On November 26, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke
delivered to Parliament the British government's budget and medium-
term financial strategy. The government aims to reduce the general
government deficit from about 5 percent of GDP in the 1995/96 fiscal
year (that ended March 30) to 4 percent of GDP in the current fiscal
year and to 2-1/2 percent of GDP in FY1997/98. The reduction in the
deficit is to come almost entirely from slow growth of public
expenditures.
In Italy, the advance estimate of GDP growth in the third
quarter was 2 percent (SAAR). (No further details will be available
until final third-quarter GDP is released on January 7.) The latest
monthly indicators have been weak. Business sentiment has remained
gloomy, while consumer confidence has continued to decline in recent
months. Consumer-price inflation on a twelve-month basis fell in
November to 2.6 percent, after peaking at 6 percent in November a
year ago.

On November 16, the lower house of the Senate, where the
governing central-left coalition relies on the outside support of
the Communist Refoundation Party (CR), approved the 1997 budget.

IV-23
The budget includes a $41 billion equivalent deficit reduction
package and aims to reduce Italy's 1997 fiscal deficit to 3 percent
of GDP. The upper house of the Senate, where the proposed budget
is currently under discussion, has until the end of the year to
ratify it.
Economic activity in Canada expanded at a robust pace in the
third quarter, reflecting a strong rebound in machinery and
equipment investment and continued growth in residential
construction. After a large inventory drawdown in the second
quarter, inventory accumulation contributed 3.3 percentage points to
third-quarter growth. Consumption expenditures remained weak,
however, and government expenditures declined. Net exports also
subtracted from growth, as export growth was offset by the surge in
machinery and equipment imports.

Indicators for the fourth quarter are very limited but suggest
that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Employment
edged up in October and November, but the unemployment rate has
remained high as labor force growth has risen as well. Housing
starts, which have been volatile this year, jumped in November to a
level 7.5 percent above the third-quarter average. A major part of
the increase in twelve-month consumer-price inflation to 1.8 percent
in October came from higher energy prices, including an increased
natural gas tax and higher gasoline prices.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, indications of output growth generally have
been strong. Mexico and Argentina have continued to bounce back
from their 1995 recessions while Brazilian output surged in the
third quarter and Venezuela showed some signs of recovery, led by
its oil sector. In Asia, output continues to grow at a more
moderate pace than in recent years, with the moderation greater in
Korea and Taiwan than in China.
Inflation mostly is on a downward trend in the developing
countries. In particular, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia have achieved
twelve-month inflation rates sharply lower than those of the
previous year. Inflation is also down in China and remains low in
Taiwan, Korea, and, especially, Argentina. As Latin American
economies have grown, a pickup in domestic demand has worsened trade
balances, most of all in Brazil. A rise in imports has also widened
the trade deficit in Korea, while trade balances have improved in
Taiwan and China.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, there were solid signs
of growth in the third quarter. GDP rose 7.4 percent from its year-
earlier level. On a seasonally adjusted basis, GDP is estimated to
have risen about 10 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, after being
about flat in the second quarter. Monthly indicators also showed
strong growth. Industrial production rose 14 percent in September
from a year earlier, while the unemployment rate declined to 5.2
percent in October, its lowest level since January 1995. The
recovery in domestic demand led to a rise in imports in the third
quarter and a reduction in the trade surplus in October to its
lowest level since January 1995.
Monthly inflation has averaged about 1.5 percent over the past
three months, well below the recent peak of 2.8 percent in April.
On a twelve-month basis, inflation has declined to below 28 percent
versus 52 percent during 1995.
The Mexican government in early November released the details
of its 1997 budget and economic projections. The government
forecasts a budget deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP for 1997, versus a
balanced budget in 1996, due largely to the cost of pension reforms
and support for the banking system. GDP is projected to grow at
least 4 percent in 1997. The government projects an inflation rate

of 15 percent (December-over-December) in 1997, down from about 27

to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1997 from 0.3 percent in 1996.
The program of privatization moved forward in December after
the October setback in the secondary petrochemical sector. On
December 5, the Mexican government approved a bid of $1.4 billion by
a Mexican-U.S. joint venture to operate Mexico's Northeast railroad
line, the busiest Mexican railway, which connects Mexico City with
Laredo, Texas and includes trunk lines to key gulf ports.
In Argentina, the economic recovery following the Tequila
recession has taken a firm hold. Real GDP displayed strong and
considerably higher-than-expected growth of 6.6 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier. Led by the auto industry, industrial
production in October was 11.3 percent higher than the same month in
1995. Inflation is still very low; consumer prices have increased
just 0.3 percent over the past twelve months. During the recovery
both exports and imports have risen, with the third-quarter trade
surplus being around $0.8 billion, almost unchanged from a year
earlier.
The Convertibility Plan appears to be in no immediate danger
even though the Argentine government missed by a considerable margin
its original fiscal targets agreed upon with the IMF, which were
subsequently renegotiated, and international reserves (excluding
gold) have fallen to $14 billion in October from $15 billion in
September. Government revenues have turned around in November and
the Congress has approved a 1997 budget that provides for a deficit

of about $3.2 billion, close to the target of $3 billion agreed with
the IMF. The central bank has taken two preventive measures to
avoid a repeat of last year's liquidity crisis. One measure is a $5
billion foreign-funded private safety net that will pay out funds to
local banks in case of a run on deposits. The other is a three
percentage point increase in bank liquidity requirements to be
phased in gradually over the next eighteen months. The peso-dollar
deposit spread has also narrowed since December 1995.
The benefits of the recent growth have not yet done much to
alleviate Argentina's stubbornly high unemployment rate. That is in
part because output is still below its peak level of two years ago,
and Congress has delayed in passing a labor reform package that
would promote the hiring of new workers.
In Brazil, real GDP grew by 11.4 percent in the third quarter
(s.a.a.r.), after growth of 6.5 percent in the second quarter. On a
year-over-year basis, third-quarter real GDP growth was 6.5 percent.
Growth was strong in most sectors, including manufacturing (which
grew by 18 percent). Inflation has remained low by Brazilian
standards under the nearly two and a half year-old exchange rate-
based stabilization program, the Plano Real. On a twelve-month
basis, inflation was 12.2 percent in October 1996, down from 23.7
percent in October 1995, and the lowest rate since the early 1970s.
Strong aggregate demand has contributed to a sharp
deterioration in the trade balance in recent months, with the
trade deficit reaching $1.3 billion in October. However, central
bank officials project a current account deficit of about 3 percent
of GDP for 1996, about the same as in 1995. In late November, in

response to concern about the deterioration in the external balance,
the government unveiled measures to boost exports through more
preferential credit terms and tax exemptions on exports.
Central bank officials have stated that current monetary and
exchange rate policies will be not be changed by the external
balance situation. The exchange rate has depreciated slowly in
nominal terms against the dollar since mid-1995, remaining about
unchanged in real terms, after a 25 percent appreciation of the real
exchange rate in the first year of the Plano Real. Indications are
that new capital flows have remained positive in recent weeks.
International reserves at the end of October (latest data available)
stood at $59 billion, unchanged from September's level.
In Venezuela, the economy is slowly emerging from recession,
helped by the recent run-up in oil prices and an IMF-supported
adjustment program. The Venezuelan oil export basket has increased
steadily since January and reached around $23 per barrel in mid-
October, the highest price since 1990. This has led to record
international reserves, which in mid-November stood at around $12
billion (excluding gold) and have increased around 90 percent since
the start of the year.
The high oil prices have allowed Venezuela to meet almost all
of its IMF targets with considerable margins, but inflation remains
a problem. Since July, monthly inflation has been around 4 percent,
although for November it has come down to 3.1 percent. On a twelve-
month basis, consumer prices have risen around 110 percent through
November. Despite this inflation, the exchange rate has remained
broadly stable, around 470 bolivars per dollar since exchange
controls were relaxed in April. The Venezuelan government seems

committed to economic reform, and the privatization program has
picked up steam with the sale in November of most of the remaining
government stake in the national telephone company (CANTV) on the
local and New York stock markets.
Real GDP in China has continued to expand briskly, albeit at a
more sustainable pace than in the 1992-94 period when GDP growth
averaged over 13 percent per year. Consumption growth has remained
very strong, with real retail sales up 13 percent in October from
their year-earlier level. Although China's generally tight monetary
policy since the middle of 1993 resulted in a marked deceleration
in investment spending in 1994-95. there are indications that
investment growth has picked up noticeably in recent months. The
12-month consumer price inflation rate fell to 7.4 percent in
September, compared with an inflation rate of 25.5 percent in 1994.
The trade balance in the first 10 months of this year registered a
surplus of $12.0 billion, compared with a surplus of $17.8 billion
over the year-earlier period. Most of this year's surplus is
attributable to a strong pickup in exports in the second half of
this year, following a contraction in exports of about 8 percent
from their year-earlier level in the first half of 1996. China's
foreign exchange reserves rose to slightly over $100 billion by mid-
November.
The central bank announced in late November that China would
make its currency (the yuan) convertible for current account
transactions effective December 1 of this year by accepting Article
VIII of the IMF Agreement. Article VIII prohibits restrictions on
payments and transfers for current account transactions, except with
IMF approval.

In Taiwan, real GDP rose 5.6 percent in the third quarter from
its year-earlier level. While consumption spending has accelerated a
bit since the beginning of this year, investment growth has remained
very weak, despite a shift toward a more accommodative monetary
policy. The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation was 3.2
percent in November, close to its average value during the past
year. Taiwan's trade surplus rose to $10.7 billion in the first 10
months of this year, compared with a surplus of $5.6 billion over
the year-earlier period. The rise in the trade surplus mainly
reflected a fall in the dollar value of imports of 3 percent over
the period, due to sluggish domestic demand; exports rose by only 3
percent over the same period. Foreign exchange reserves stood at
$87.3 billion at the end of October, compared with $91.5 billion a
year earlier.

In Korea, real GDP grew 6.4 percent in the third quarter from
its year-earlier level, the slowest quarterly growth in three years.
The slowdown was concentrated in the investment and export sectors,
which both rose at an annual rate of 9 percent, compared with rates
exceeding 20 percent a year ago. As a result of continued robust

growth in imports, Korea's trade deficit widened to $10.4 billion in
the first nine months of the year. Industrial production in October
grew 10.8 percent from its year-earlier level, compared with 7.3
percent in September. The higher growth in October reflected fewer
holidays in the month and a recovery of sales of vehicles and oil
products. Consumer prices in October were 5.1 percent above their
year-earlier level. On November 26, Korea's Parliament ratified the
country's membership in the OECD.

In Russia, the economy and economic reform are muddling along
as President Boris Yeltsin completes his recovery from quintuple
bypass surgery. Indications are that real economic activity has
continued to decline, but the decline has been slowing. Monthly
inflation has been under two percent for the past three months. The
ruble-dollar exchange rate has depreciated by less than two percent
per month the last three months, staying well within the crawling
band "corridor" established by the central bank. The central bank
announced that it will continue to use the corridor in 1997, and is
predicting inflation of around 12 percent for 1997. However, the
government also intends to allow the money supply to expand by 30
percent.
Russia's three-year, $10 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility
has been held up, but it appears that it will move back on track
with revised fiscal targets soon. For the second time since the
program began eight months ago, the IMF delayed the release of the
month's tranche. The IMF's chief concern in this review was
Russia's failure to meet its revenue targets. Tax revenue for
January through October 1996 was only 75 percent of planned

Russia continues to integrate itself into world capital
markets: on November 20, Russia's debut Eurobond was well-received,
with the $1 billion offering oversubscribed and selling at a yield
of 9.45 percent, 350 basis points above U.S. Treasuries and below
yields for similar instruments of countries with similar debt
ratings.
