DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Domestic demand has remained robust, and the economy
consequently has continued to register sizable gains in employment
in early 1997. Although increasingly tight labor markets have been
mirrored in an uptrend in average hourly earnings, other signs of
inflationary pressure are still few and far between. CPI inflation
has been modest in the past two months, with increases in "core"
prices running below even the reduced pace of 1996.
Labor Market Developments
Total nonfarm payroll employment grew briskly again in
February, and aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory
workers on nonagricultural payrolls soared, more than reversing the
sharp weather-related decline in January. In the household survey,
the civilian unemployment rate has continued to fluctuate narrowly,
averaging 5.3 percent over January and February. The labor force
participation rate jumped to a historical peak of 67.2 percent in
January and then slipped back to 67.0 percent in February.
Three special factors buffeted the employment numbers for
January and February. First, as a result of seasonal adjustment
problems associated with last year's January blizzard, employment
gains in several industries--most notably help-supply services--were
overstated this January and understated in February by approximately
80,000. Second, changes in the monthly patterns of post-Christmas
layoffs resulted in a sharp drop in jobs at general merchandise
stores in January and an offsetting bounceback in February.1
Third, the BLS estimates that February's reported 109,000 jump in
employment in the construction industry likely overstated the true
strength in this industry by around 85,000. Only a small portion
(perhaps 10,000) of this outsized gain represented a bounceback from
the poor weather in the Midwest and South, which held back
construction activity in January. More important, the unseasonably
mild weather in February throughout much of 'the country led builders
to begin their spring hiring earlier than usual. After netting out
these factors, nonfarm payrolls still expanded very rapidly in
1. The late timing of the January reference period likely
contributed to the odd monthly pattern in employment at general
merchandise stores because some seasonal layoffs normally picked up
in February were probably reported in January this year. The BLS
estimates that the reported numbers understated January employment
growth at general merchandise stores by about 50,000 and exaggerated
the February rise in employment by the same amount.

January and February, with job growth averaging more than 250,000
per month.2
In February, average weekly hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers on nonagricultural payrolls soared 0.8 hour,
to 35.0 hours, more than reversing a dip in the preceding month.
The February increase in the workweek was widespread across major
industry divisions, with all but the manufacturing industry showing
a sharp jump in weekly hours. But even in manufacturing, the
workweek increased 0.2 hour, to 41.9 hours--retracing much of its
0.3 hour January decline--and overtime hours turned up 0.1 hour to
4.7 hours per week. Largely because of the February run-up in the
workweek, aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory
workers in private industry were up 2.7 percent in February after
falling 1.6 percent in January. Smoothing through the monthly
volatility, the workweek has averaged 34.6 hours thus far in the
first quarter, little changed from its fourth-quarter level. The
January-February average of the aggregate index of production worker
hours was up 0.5 percent (not at an annual rate) from its fourth-
quarter average.
On a quarterly average basis, the average workweek has
lengthened considerably since the end of 1995 and has now climbed
most of the way back to its most recent peak in 1994.3 The
lengthening workweek may be an indication that firms are constrained
in their hiring by a lack of suitable workers.
Other indicators of labor demand also remain on the strong
side. Initial claims for unemployment insurance averaged just over
310,000 during the past four weeks--the lowest sustained level since
early 1989. In addition, the Conference Board's index of help
wanted advertising--a crude gauge of the number of unfilled
positions--ticked up in January to its highest level in the past ten
years. Meanwhile, respondents to the Conference Board and the
Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) consumer confidence surveys
perceive strong current and future labor market conditions
respectively. The Manpower, Inc., survey of hiring intentions for
2. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also announced the results of
its annual benchmarking. With the release of the May 1997 data, the
BLS will increase job growth between March 1995 and March 1996 by an
amount that cumulates to 57,000 by the end of that period. The
relatively small size of the benchmark revisions will leave the
employment picture for 1995 and 1996 essentially unchanged.
3. This comparison excludes the workweek reported for the first
quarter of 1996 because it was held down by the East Coast blizzard.

the second quarter also paints an upbeat picture of labor demand;
experience suggests, however, that the reading may say more about
the strength of hiring in the current quarter than in the spring.
The strong demand for labor has been pulling additional people
into the labor market. Looking through the zigs and zags of the
past two years, one can now discern something akin to a cyclical
4pickup in labor force participation. The labor force
participation rate has averaged 67.1 percent through the first two
months of the first quarter, up from 66.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1996, while the unemployment rate has held steady at
5.3 percent.
The flip side of the strong employment and workweek gains in
1996 was disappointing productivity growth. The most recent
published data show that labor productivity in the nonfarm business
sector grew 0.9 percent over the four quarters of 1996. This marked
the largest annual increase since 1992: nonetheless, the 1996
reading still left average productivity growth during the current
expansion below its long-run trend rate of expansion.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rebounded 1/2 percent in February after
declining a bit in January. Increases were particularly sharp among
producers of durable goods, whose output advanced 1-1/4 percent
after changing little in January. The February increase in total
industrial production was moderated by a plunge in the output of
utilities, reflecting the unseasonably mild weather last month, and
only a small gain in the production of nondurable goods. The
upsurge in production brings the factory utilization rate in
February back to 82-1/2 percent, the upper end of the 82 percent to
82-1/2 percent range that generally has prevailed for more than a
year.
4. With the release of the January employment data, the BLS
attempted to correct the population weights used to construct
estimates of employment and the labor force from the monthly CPS for
a systematic undercounting of recent immigrants to the United
States, primarily Hispanic males. This change added 298,000 to
employment and 317,000 to the labor force in January but had no
perceptible effect on estimates of the unemployment rate or the
labor force participation rate.
5. As we discussed in the January Greenbook, the gap between the
product-side and income-side measures of output growth has been
sizable over the past several years. Along with other
considerations, the large gap suggests the possibility that the BEA
will revise up its estimates of GDP and of nonfarm business sector
output growth over 1993-96 when it releases its annual revisions
this summer.

The output of motor vehicles and parts rose further in
February, to a level more than 8 percent above the strike-related
low in October. Assemblies of light vehicles, at 12.4 million units
(annual rate), raised the days' supply at the end of the month
(based on February sales) only to a still comfortable 64 days.
Looking ahead, schedules call for production to be well maintained
over the remainder of the first half at an annual rate of slightly
more than 12 million units.

The output of aircraft and parts, an area of ongoing strength,
rose further in February, with a sharp 3 percent gain in the
production of commercial aircraft. Underpinned by the strength in
orders, mainly from foreign airlines, Boeing's current schedule
calls for raising the output of completed planes from twenty-six per
month this quarter to forty planes a month by the fourth quarter of
this year--the company's highest ever monthly production rate. This
planned increase would be consistent with growth of total commercial
aircraft output of more than 50 percent this year.
By major market group (excluding energy items), the output of
consumer goods advanced 1/2 percent in February, boosted by a
snap-back in the production of goods for the home, mainly appliances
and carpeting. The output of business equipment rose 1.1 percent
further in February, with all major categories posting gains. The
output of construction supplies, which was weak around the turn of
the year, rebounded in February and has, on balance, remained at the
high level reached last summer. The output of durable materials
rose sharply, a result not only of a 2 percent advance in
semiconductor output but also of a rebound in the production of

1. Orders excluding defense capital goods, nondefense aircraft, and

2. Nominal adjusted durable goods orders were split into two
components, computers and all other. These components were deflated
and then aggregated in a chain-weighted fashion.
Most of the indicators of economic activity suggest a moderate
production pace in the next few months. The staff's series on
adjusted orders for durable goods bounced back in January after two
months of significant negative growth, and the National Association
of Purchasing Managers' (NAPM) diffusion index for orders increased
in February after having fallen in January. With manufacturing
capacity estimated to be expanding at about a 4 percent annual rate,
a continuation of the recent pace of production, which to date has
not resulted in a deterioration of vendor performance, is unlikely
to put much upward pressure on the overall factory operating rate.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light motor vehicles picked up to a 15-1/4 million
unit pace on average in January and February (annual rate). The
increase reflects, in large part, a recovery in the supply of
vehicles, which had been disrupted last quarter by labor disputes at
GM and by model changeover difficulties. On balance, sales in the
past five months averaged 15 million units, the same pace that
prevailed in the second and third quarters of last year.

Confidential data indicate that a step-up in sales to consumers
accounted for the strong performance in February, with fleet sales
having only partially recovered from November's strike-related
plunge.
In the near term, several factors are working to sustain the
strength in consumer demand. The preliminary Michigan SRC survey
for March reported that consumers' attitudes toward car-buying
jumped back to the upper end of the favorable range that has
prevailed since early 1996. The Conference Board consumer survey
for February also indicated that the proportion of households
planning to buy new automobiles moved up. According to the Michigan
survey, consumers are finding the prices of new cars quite
attractive. Indeed, sales incentives remain sizable, and news
reports suggest they will remain high or perhaps increase in the
second quarter. The heavy incentives activity is being driven, at
least in part, by the recent deterioration in GM, Ford, and
Chrysler's market share of automobile sales. While the Big Three's
market share has recovered from the strike-related fourth-quarter
plunge, it remains at the low end of recent experience.
Personal Income and Consumption
After a lackluster December, consumer spending picked up
considerably in early 1997, supported by continued solid growth of
income and highly favorable consumer sentiment. According to the
advance report, total nominal retail sales increased 0.8 percent in
February and are now estimated to have increased 1-1/2 percent in
January. Spending in the retail control category, which excludes
sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores,
rose 1.3 percent in January and 0.4 percent in February. On the
whole, average nominal spending in the retail control category
during the first two months of this year was up 1.8 percent from its
fourth-quarter level--9 percent, at an annual rate.
Spending on services rose strongly in January, the latest month
for which estimates are available. Real expenditures on energy
services jumped 3.6 percent (not at an annual rate) because of
unseasonably cold weather in January. However, energy spending
probably fell back last month, when, according to national weather
data, temperatures were milder than normal. Non-energy services
rose 0.4 percent in January, reflecting the gains in brokerage
services that accompanied the large volume of equity trading.

Official estimates are available only through January, but
personal income growth is apparently continuing at a fast pace this
quarter. Real disposable personal income rose 0.5 percent in
January after increasing the same amount in December. The January
gain was largely attributable to a sizable increase in transfer
payments, primarily the result of annual cost-of-living adjustments
in federal transfer programs (which are not seasonally adjusted),
but also boosted by changes to the earned income credit program.
Private-sector wage and salary disbursements actually declined in
January when average weekly hours dropped. Nonetheless, the
substantial increase in aggregate hours in February suggests that
the January decline was more than reversed last month.
Readings of consumer sentiment have remained very upbeat. In
January, the sentiment index from the Conference Board survey
reached its highest level since the late 1980s. In February and in
March's preliminary report, the Michigan SRC survey followed suit--
reaching the highest level since 1965. Households reported
increasingly favorable views of their current personal financial
situation.
Although both sentiment indexes have registered solid gains in
the past year, the increase has been more dramatic for the
Conference Board index. A key factor explaining its rise has been a
marked improvement in households' views of current employment
conditions: The percentage of respondents saying that jobs are
plentiful rose from one-quarter in June 1996 to almost one-third in
February 1997. In contrast, because the Michigan index does not
include a question about current employment conditions, it is not
directly affected by perceptions of the labor market. Nonetheless,
the Michigan survey does ask a question, not included in the
composite index, about expectations for unemployment during the next
twelve months. Here, also, households' views have improved
considerably since last summer, with the fraction expecting higher
unemployment dropping from 35 percent in June 1996 to 24 percent in
February and March. Thus, both surveys provide evidence of receding
concerns about unemployment, enhancing the prospects for sustained
strength in household spending in the near term. Further gains in
stock market wealth of course point in the same direction.

activity, obscuring underlying trends. In December, adverse weather
depressed single-family housing starts quite noticeably; in
contrast, exceptionally mild weather boosted starts in February.
Putting greater weight on the permits figures, which ordinarily
provide a more reliable reading of the direction of activity than do
the starts numbers, we would judge that single-family construction
has been on a steady to slightly upward sloped course of late.
In addition to the potentially distorting effects of unusual
weather, a statistical break in the Census Bureau's series on sales
of new homes has made discerning current market conditions more
difficult than usual. While reporting that sales of new homes
jumped in January to 870,000 units, the second-fastest pace on
record, the Census Bureau noted that new computerized data
collection methods that it began implementing last May seem to be
imparting an upward bias to the estimates. The Census staff used ad
hoc procedures to counteract the overstatement of the January
estimate, but the accuracy of the resulting adjustments is difficult
to assess. Until the Census Bureau accumulates more experience with
the new data collection methods, we will likely face considerable
uncertainty about the reliability of monthly estimates of new-home
sales. Sales of existing homes also rose in January, offsetting
part of the December decline.
Other indicators are somewhat ambiguous about the strength of
demand for single-family homes. Builders' assessments of new-home
sales increased in early March but remain at a moderate level, well
below their recent high in the second quarter of 1996. In the first
half of March, homebuying attitudes, as measured by preliminary
readings from the Michigan SRC survey, dropped back to the lowest
level since September. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes
have continued the erratic pattern they have exhibited since late
last year. Smoothing through the sharp ups and downs, in recent
weeks the pace of applications is running at about the same average
level as was observed during most of last year.
Multifamily housing starts rebounded in February after plunging
abruptly in January. Although the demand for multifamily units has
strengthened in some areas, the imbalance of supply and demand for
the sector as a whole has not improved noticeably. The vacancy rate
for multifamily rental units has edged up over the past two years,
and residential rent remains at an eleven-year low in real terms (as
measured in the CPI).

II-21
Business Fixed Investment
Available indicators suggest that real business fixed
investment is continuing to grow at a healthy pace in the first
quarter, led by another large gain in business purchases of
computers and by a further expansion of nonresidential construction
activity.
After large increases at the end of 1996, nominal shipments of
nondefense capital goods fell 2.5 percent in January. Outside of
transportation and information technology, shipments fell
2.3 percent in January, and bookings were little changed. Both
shipments and orders for these goods have been fluctuating around a
fairly stable level for the past year.
In the office and computing equipment component, nominal
shipments held at their high December level; businesses have
continued to seek efficiency gains through advances in automation,
and the reduced operating costs of the latest generation of servers
running Windows NT has sparked a new wave of system upgrades. Given
the steep price declines in this sector, the January reading points
to another large increase in real spending on office and computing
equipment.
Shipments of communications equipment fell substantially over
the December-January period after posting large gains in 1996.
Bookings tend to be lumpy for the diverse products grouped in this
category, but of late they have been even more volatile than usual.
Nonetheless, underlying the month-to-month swings seems to be an
ongoing expansion of investment in communications equipment driven
by technological change. For example, increased usage of the
Internet is boosting capital spending on telecommunications
equipment, as local phone lines in some regions have become
overloaded and on-line providers struggle to meet rising demand--
American Online being the most highly publicized case. In addition,
many states are proceeding with telecommunications deregulation in
spite of the delays in implementation of the Telecommunications
Reform Act at the federal level. Perhaps as a response to these
developments. AT&T has announced plans to almost double capital
spending on its network this year--to $9 billion--in anticipation of
its entry into local phone markets. In addition, a series of
multiyear, multiple-satellite orders in recent months suggests that
the demand for satellites is strong.

Business purchases of motor vehicles have changed little, on
balance, in recent months. Fleet sales of autos increased sharply
in December and January, partially recovering from strike-depressed
levels in October and November. In contrast, sales of light trucks
to businesses--which were less affected by the GM strike--fell back
in December and January after outsized gains in the prior two
months. After bottoming out in November and December, sales of
medium and heavy trucks turned up in January and were essentially
unchanged in February.
Even after rising very rapidly in the fourth quarter, outlays
for nonresidential structures appear to be increasing further this
quarter. Construction put-in-place rose 2.8 percent in January, to
a level 1.7 percent above the fourth-quarter average. Following
December declines, spending for office, other commercial, and
lodging and miscellaneous buildings resumed upward trends. Other
indicators of demand paint a picture of continuing growth over the
coming quarters. Contracts for construction remain at a high level
and point, in particular, to increased construction of office
buildings. Vacancy rates for office buildings stand near their
lowest levels since the mid-1980s, and the National Real Estate
Index indicates that transactions prices for office buildings have
been rising since early 1994. The FDIC real estate survey of senior
examiners and asset managers also reports a very upbeat assessment
of the strength of the commercial market.
Business Inventories
Modest inventory investment in January, following stock
drawdowns in November and December, left business inventories lean
early in the first quarter. For most manufacturing industries and
trade groupings, inventory-sales ratios in January were near the low
end of their recent ranges. On the whole, business establishments
appear to have some room for restocking in coming months.
Manufacturers' stocks were virtually unchanged in January.
Among industries producing capital goods, the sizable buildup in
inventories of aircraft and parts that began more than a year ago
continued; stocks of several types of industrial machinery also
expanded. In contrast, inventories of computing and office
equipment declined further in January (in book value terms), the
ninth monthly decline during the past twelve months. Stocks of
telecommunications equipment and construction machinery were little
changed. In the consumer goods sector, producers of household

durables, nondurable home goods, and apparel all reported small
stock accumulations in January following little net change over the
fourth quarter. However, inventories held by tobacco producers
posted an unusually large runoff in January, with the bulk of the
decline in stocks of materials and supplies. Given the brisk pace
of shipments of finished tobacco in December and January and the
sizable decline in the inventory-shipments ratio for the industry,
the January runoff did not appear to have stemmed from a serious
overhang. On the whole, manufacturers' inventories were
reasonably well balanced in January; the inventory-shipments ratio
for all manufacturing was at its lowest point in recent years.
In contrast to manufacturing, wholesale inventories expanded
substantially in January--up at an annual rate of $32 billion in
book-value terms--after generally moderate inventory buildups during
the fourth quarter. While stocks of motor vehicles and accessories
accounted for about one-third of the January accumulation, non-
vehicle stocks also showed widespread increases. In particular,
inventories at wholesale apparel outlets expanded further in January
after increasing substantially in December. In both months,
however, the accumulations were accompanied by very strong
shipments, and the inventory-sales ratio for apparel distributors
dropped to its lowest level in the current expansion. Most types of
wholesale establishments appear to have had no serious inventory
imbalances.
Further downstream, non-auto retail inventories fell at a
$10 billion annual rate in January. Large drawdowns occurred at
general merchandise stores, where sales surged in January, and at
outlets selling other durable goods. In contrast, stores selling
nondurables other than general merchandise, food, and apparel saw a
second large monthly accumulation of inventories. Overall, the
inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers dropped to the low end
of the range of the preceding year. However, at general
merchandisers, stocks fell to a twenty-year low relative to sales.
6. Output fell sharply in the tobacco industry in January, and
the precipitous drop in inventories of materials and supplies was
consistent with that decline. In addition, some U.S. tobacco
manufacturers are reported to be taking steps to shift their
production operations overseas--partly to take advantage of the
lower labor costs and partly to escape the increasingly prevalent
anti-smoking sentiment in this country. Thus, a portion of the
January drawdown in materials inventories in the tobacco industry
may also reflect the initial downshift in tobacco manufacturing in
the United States as part of the industry's new global strategy.

Given the continued strength in sales at general merchandise stores
in February, some rebuilding of stocks in coming months seems
likely.
Federal Sector
Real federal expenditures on consumption and gross investment,
as measured in the national income and product accounts, rose about
1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter
of 1996. The rise was mostly an artifact of events in late 1995-
government shutdowns and restrictive continuing resolutions for
programs covered by unpassed appropriations bills--that held real
purchases to especially low levels. The underlying trend of
federal consumption and investment expenditures probably is better
represented by the 2-1/2 percent average annual rate of decline from
the fourth quarter of 1994 to the final quarter of 1996. Reductions
have occurred in both real defense purchases and real nondefense
purchases.
For the first four months of fiscal year 1997, the federal
unified budget deficit, adjusted for payment timing shifts and
excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was
$2 billion higher than last year--a 4-1/4 percent increase.
Relative to last year, both receipts and adjusted outlays were up
about 6 percent. One factor contributing to the rise in outlays was
increased spending on health programs, with Medicare spending
10 percent higher and Medicaid spending 11 percent higher than last
year. While the growth in Medicare is in line with recent trends,
Medicaid growth far exceeds the 3 percent rate observed last year.
The rebound in Medicaid growth appears to indicate that last year's
slowdown in outlays for that program was only a temporary
phenomenon. Other increases in outlays included a 4 percent rise in
adjusted defense spending and a 13 percent surge in outlays for
nondefense items other than net interest and social insurance
programs (social security, health, income security). In the first
7. The Bureau of Economic Analysis's $3.7 billion downward
revision from its advance estimate to its preliminary estimate of
real federal purchases in the fourth quarter of 1996 primarily
reflected the incorporation of additional data on defense purchases.
New detail from the Monthly Treasury Statement for December led the
BEA to reallocate the composition of total defense purchases so that
defense consumption was decreased and defense investment was
increased, although total defense purchases were unchanged. Also,
additional Department of Defense procurement and delivery data
caused BEA to revise down defense investment, thus reducing total
defense purchases. The new data included information indicating
that one fewer C17 airplane than expected had been delivered.

four months of 1996, spending out of many defense and nondefense
accounts was depressed by restrictive continuing resolutions.
The President's budget for fiscal 1998, which was released in
early February, incorporates proposals broadly similar to those he
offered last year. According to OMB scoring, the President's
proposals would result in a narrowing of the deficit over the next
several years and would yield a $17 billion surplus in 2002. The
proposals would reduce net spending--particularly discretionary
spending and Medicare--and step up the pace of spectrum auctions.
The President's plan also includes a set of tax provisions that on
net lead to a small revenue loss. Measured relative to the OMB's
current-services baseline, the President's plan produces
$254 billion in aggregate deficit reduction (including associated
lower debt-service payments) over six years, with about three-
quarters of the savings scheduled to occur in fiscal 2001 and 2002.
According to CBO scoring, however, the deficit under the
President's "basic" budget plan would be $69 billion in 2002,
$86 billion more than estimated by the OMB. Differences in economic
assumptions underlying the baseline budget projections account for
almost two-thirds of the discrepancy between the OMB and CBO
projections. The remaining one-third is due to differences in the
scoring of the President's policies; the largest differences are for
spectrum sales in 2002 and the President's Medicare proposals.
In anticipation of the CBO's less favorable assessment, the
President proposed a trigger mechanism that would be used if the
budget seems unlikely to reach balance in fiscal 2002. The trigger
would invoke a set of "alternative policies," including maintaining
the scheduled suspension of the tax cuts after 2000 (raising an
additional $24 billion in 2002) and imposing additional spending
cuts in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (reducing spending by $45 billion
in 2002). In this scenario, essentially all of the aggregate 1998-
2002 deficit reduction would occur in the last two fiscal years.
The aviation excise taxes that had expired on December 31,
1996, were reinstated on March 7. These taxes, which were included
in the President's proposals, are expected to raise a total of
$2.7 billion through the remainder of fiscal 1997.

strength may be related to seasonal adjustment difficulties.
Construction outlays were up a bit further in January: during the
fourth quarter, real spending on structures, on a NIPA basis, rose
at a rapid 11.6 percent annual rate. In January, a large drop in
construction of sewer systems was more than offset by increases in
school and highway building.
The fiscal position of most states continues to look quite
strong. More than half the states are reporting that revenues have
been coming in ahead of expectations; few are requesting
supplemental appropriations to cover overruns, and about a third are
considering tax cuts. Nonetheless, the budgetary picture in a small
number of states remains tight. In particular, three states--Idaho,
Hawaii, and Tennessee--report that revenues are below expectations
so far this year. More generally, with Medicaid costs having picked
up, many analysts caution that cost increases for health care may
once again become a budget problem for the states.
Prices and Labor Costs
Recent readings for core consumer prices extended the modest
increases seen over the past year. For items other than food and
energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in February after increasing just
0.1 percent in January. During the twelve months ended in February,
the core CPI increased 2.5 percent, down from the 2.9 percent pace
recorded in the year-earlier period. Within the core, the
deceleration was most noticeable in the goods category, while prices
of services rose only a bit less than over the previous twelve
months. Among goods, prices decelerated for motor vehicles, house
furnishings, and a range of other items such as personal care goods.
Because many of these products are produced outside the United
States, their prices can be heavily influenced by non-oil import
prices, which have decelerated considerably over the past several
quarters as the dollar has strengthened. This constellation of
developments suggests that the downswing in import prices helped
restrain core consumer prices in the past year.
Consumer energy prices rose 0.3 percent further last month, a
pace considerably more moderate than in the previous several months.
Crude-oil prices have largely reversed last year's run-up, relieving
much of the pressure on gasoline and heating oil prices. With mild
weather in many parts of the country as the heating season draws to

dropped 2.8 percent--a notable turnaround from the 0.8 percent
increase for 1995 and the 2.8 percent advance for 1994.

a close, heating oil prices dropped 1.9 percent further in February.
Although retail gasoline prices were unchanged in February,
developments at earlier stages of processing suggest that the bad
news on gasoline prices is now receding in the rear-view mirror.
Similarly, although natural gas prices rose further in February,
lower wellhead prices will likely ease pressure on prices paid by
consumers. However, consumer electricity prices were up 0.5 percent
in February after subsiding over the preceding four months.
After a couple of months of favorable news, consumer food
prices turned up 0.3 percent in February as the January freeze in
Florida began to push up prices of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Increases in the prices of other food items appear largely to have
returned to a modest trend, with a couple of exceptions. The price
of raw coffee beans has surged about 50 percent since the end of
December; inventories have been low for some time, and weather and
other factors have caused delays in getting the harvest to market.
Even with futures prices pointing down sharply over the summer,
substantial increases in retail coffee prices appear to be in train
for the next few months. In a more favorable development,
McDonald's recently announced that it will cut the price of Big Macs
to 55 cents beginning April 25 and will establish discounts on some
breakfast items at the beginning of April. Because the company's
domestic sales amounted to an estimated 6-1/2 percent of total food
purchased in restaurants last year, these hefty price cuts could
show through to the CPI for overall food.
For items other than food and energy, prices were up
0.2 percent in February. Airfares dropped further, likely a result
of the sale initiated by American Airlines after the pilots' strike
was averted in mid-February.10 This month, airfares may be
boosted by the reinstatement of the ticket tax on March 7. However,
while these excise taxes will likely be passed on to consumers in
the long run, the short-run effect on airfares may be muted because
prices for airline tickets are constantly changing in response to a
host of other factors. Observers have noted that not all airline
9. A very rough estimate by the staff suggests that these price
cuts could shave roughly 0.1 percentage point off the increase in
the food price index this year.
10. Because airfares are sampled only every other month in some
cities, the expiration of the airline ticket tax at the end of last
year would be picked up in these cities only in February. Thus, the
expiration of this tax may also have contributed to the February
decline in airfares.

ticket prices fell when the taxes expired at the end of last year;
some airlines increased their fares when the tax cut expired.
Similarly, many airlines are reported to have lowered their base
(pre-tax) ticket prices following the tax reinstatement so as to
reduce the impact on consumers. Outside of airfares, most items
registered small price increases last month.11
At the producer level, the recent news on finished goods prices
has been quite favorable. The PPI for finished goods declined
0.4 percent in February; the index for food continued a string of
monthly declines, and lower prices for crude oil fed through to a
1.2 percent decline in the index for finished energy items. Prices
of finished goods excluding food and energy ticked down 0.1 percent
last month, with prices decreasing for both consumer and capital
goods. Among consumer goods, price declines were widespread across
a range of durable and nondurable items. Within the capital goods
component, computer prices posted an extraordinary plunge of
5.2 percent at a monthly rate, the largest drop since the series was
added to the PPI in 1991. Over the twelve months ended in February,
the core PPI rose only 0.5 percent, down from a 2.1 percent increase
in the prior twelve-month period. Although the producer price index
covers only domestically produced goods, prices of some of those
items likely have been restrained in the past year by competitively
priced imports.
Although broad measures of prices remain relatively tame for
the time being, some prices at earlier stages of processing have
moved up, perhaps reflecting scattered capacity pressures. On
balance, metals prices have trended up since the end of last year,
with the Journal of Commerce metals index rising an additional
2.7 percent since the last Greenbook. Price increases have been
sharpest for steel scrap, although copper and aluminum prices have
risen as well. Moreover, the purchasing managers' index of prices
paid moved up in February; more respondents reported paying higher
prices for metals as well as some other items. Among other
industrial materials, plywood prices have moved higher since the
last Greenbook; lumber prices have eased recently but are still up
significantly from their average last year. Considering basic
11. With the release of the January CPI, the BLS initiated new
procedures for measuring hospital prices, moving in the direction of
the treatment-path approach used in the PPI. On the assumption that
the new CPI for hospital services moves similarly to its PPI
counterpart, this shift in methodology should shave about
0.05 percentage point from the change in the CPI over 1997.

other than food and energy has continued to accelerate; this index
has increased 3.2 percent over the past six months, compared with a
decline of 5.6 percent over the preceding half-year period.

up. Indeed, the mean expected price increase over the next year, as
measured by the Michigan SRC survey, is now running lower than it
was six months ago. On the other hand, median inflation
12expectations have been little changed. Similarly, other survey
measures of inflation expectations--over both short and long
horizons--have remained flat or have edged off in recent months.
Turning to labor markets, employers' hourly wage costs have
continued their moderate acceleration despite only small increases
in January and February. Over the twelve months ended in February,
average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on
nonagricultural payrolls increased 3.8 percent, up from 3.0 percent
and 2.6 percent during the twelve-month periods ended in February
1996 and 1995, respectively. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm
business sector--which includes estimates of nonwage benefit costs
as well as wages and salaries--was up 3.6 percent at an annual rate
in the fourth quarter. On a fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter
basis, hourly compensation increased 3.6 percent in 1996, about the
same rate of increase as in 1995.13
12. In recent months, the decline in mean inflation expectations
relative to the median reflects drops in the inflation forecasts of
survey respondents at both the upper and lower ends of the
distribution.
13. In this environment of tightening labor markets, American
Airlines and its pilots continue to negotiate an end to their
dispute. In addition to differences in wage demands--the pilots
were demanding an 11.5 percent increase over four years while the
airline was offering 5 percent--the major point of contention is the
company's proposal to have lower-paid pilots from a different union
fly smaller jets on routes serviced by its American Eagle
subsidiary. The two sides are in the middle of a sixty-day cooling-
off period imposed by the President, which ends on April 16: a
three-member "emergency board" is mediating the dispute. Were the
pilots to strike at the end of the cooling-off period, 75,000 to
90,000 American Airlines workers would likely be put on leave
without pay; a strike could also have many ripple effects on
employment in regions served predominantly by American and at
American's hubs.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Interest rates have increased since the February FOMC meeting,
responding to both economic news and the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony. In the opening weeks of the intermeeting period, market
participants generally interpreted incoming data as implying subdued
inflation and reduced odds of Federal Reserve tightening (chart, top
panel). However, rates rose markedly after the Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony, in which the Federal Reserve was seen as more concerned
about potential inflation and more willing to take preemptive action
to restrain it than markets had thought. Against this background,
rates also increased after the March 13 report on retail sales,
which seemed to provide some rationale for a policy tightening, but
then eased slightly on the release of favorable February data for
producer prices. On balance, Treasury bill rates have moved up 15
to 20 basis points, and longer-term yields 25 to 35 basis points.
Current quotes on short-term interest rate futures suggest that,
allowing for liquidity premiums, the market places the odds of a
25 basis point System tightening at about 50 percent in March and
roughly 70 percent by May (bottom panel).
With interest rates rising, stock prices flattened out or
turned down over the intermeeting period. The S&P 500 index was
essentially unchanged, and the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 indexes fell
7-1/2 percent and 3-1/2 percent respectively. Nevertheless, price-
earnings ratios remain generally quite high.
Private debt growth appears to have stepped up a bit in the
first quarter from its fourth-quarter pace. Borrowing by
nonfinancial corporations, in particular, seems to have
strengthened. Commercial paper issuance has turned positive on net,
C&I bank loans have grown briskly, and bond offerings have remained
close to the fourth-quarter average. Meanwhile, preliminary data
suggest that household borrowing may have ticked up in the first
quarter. In contrast, government debt issuance weakened in the
early part of the year, with federal debt growth slowing further and
state and local government debt flattening out.
Business Finance
Business activity in credit markets has been strong in the
first quarter. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations in
January and February was close to the fourth-quarter pace (table).
The run-up in interest rates since December apparently damped sales

of investment-grade bonds, but offerings of speculative-grade bonds
have been brisk. Fully a third of the nonfinancial bonds issued in
the first two months of the year were rated B or lower (lower left
panel). Despite the heavy issuance of junk bonds, spreads between
their rates and Treasury yields have continued to narrow and are now
at their lowest point since data collection began in the mid-1980s.
The market has been supported by sizable flows into junk-bond mutual
funds, as investors appear to have less concern about credit risk.
Among the new investment-grade issues by nonfinancial companies
were a few 100-year bonds. Although the yields on "century" bonds
are somewhat higher than other long-term yields, companies believe
that these bonds can lower their overall borrowing costs by raising
their profile among investors. However, sales of these bonds may
soon come to a halt because of the President's proposal to eliminate
the tax deductibility of interest paid on bonds of such long
maturity.
The flattening of the yield curve in late 1996 encouraged
companies to pay down commercial paper by selling bonds, but the
recent backup in long rates has stemmed this practice. As a
consequence, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding has risen
moderately this quarter after contracting sharply in the fourth
quarter of last year (lower right panel). Quality spreads on
commercial paper have been largely unaffected by the default of
Mercury Finance, a subprime auto lender.
Corporate credit quality remains quite good overall. Moody's
downgraded slightly more nonfinancial debt in January and February
than it upgraded, but the largest downgrade (of $6 billion of JC
Penney bonds) was related to a merger that many analysts believe
will prove to be successful. Moreover, possible upgrades exceed
downgrades on Moody's Watchlist, both by number and volume, and the
default rate on speculative-grade debt so far this year has trailed
last year's already low pace. In contrast, business failures appear
to have picked up appreciably in December and January, although the
figures are preliminary and subject to possibly large revisions.
1. Another recent innovation in capital markets was the issuance
of inflation-indexed securities by several financial corporations
shortly after the first Treasury auction of indexed government debt.
However, these companies quickly swapped the debt with dealers, who
have been unable so far to find counterparties interested in bearing
the inflation risk. Instead, the dealers have purchased inflation-
indexed Treasury bonds to hedge their positions.

Moving beyond the securities markets, businesses have acquired
substantial new funds through bank loans in the first quarter.
Commercial and industrial loans at banks increased about 11 percent
on average in January and February, slightly below the fourth-
quarter increase but above the growth rate for 1996 as a whole.
The pace of new equity offerings in January and February fell
back from the fourth-quarter rate, with the decline attributable
entirely to a drop in initial public offerings. Registrations of
prospective IPOs have edged off as well. The IPO market has cooled
substantially, with new issues being priced below the intended range
more often than above it and first-day trading returns down sharply
from last year (top panel). Nonfinancial corporations have
continued to retire equity on net since year-end. Merger-related
retirements alone in January and February, at $10.5 billion, equaled
gross issuance. Data on completed share repurchases are available
only through the third quarter of last year; however, announcements
of new repurchase programs have moved up from last year's already
high level.
Stock prices have slipped a little, on balance, since the last
FOMC meeting, but valuations generally remain rich by historical
standards. For the S&P 500, the ratio of expected twelve-month-
ahead earnings to price is low relative to the thirty-year Treasury
yield (middle panel). Stock prices have been buoyed by expectations
of long-term nominal earnings growth that are above their peak in
the early 1990s and have been revised higher in recent months
(bottom left panel). The run-up in expected earnings growth is even
more dramatic in real terms because long-term inflation expectations
(for example, as measured in the Philadelphia Fed survey) seem to
have declined about half a percentage point in the past few years.
Part of the explanation for this favorable outlook may be the surge
in profits from overseas operations since late 1994: Analysts'
earnings projections for S&P 500 firms with significant foreign
operations exceed expectations for other firms in the S&P 500, and
the gap has widened noticeably over the past two years (bottom right
panel).
The markets for commercial real estate and commercial mortgages
continue to be strong. In the January FDIC survey of federal
examiners and asset managers, significantly more respondents
reported increases in demand for new office space than reported
decreases, compared with three months earlier (top left panel).

(top right panel). Meanwhile, the Barron's/Levy February survey of
primary commercial mortgage lenders indicated that interest rate
spreads on ten-year mortgages remained in the relatively favorable
range that has prevailed over the past few years (bottom panel). In
addition, spreads on commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs)
have slipped to historically narrow levels.
Over the past two years, outstanding commercial mortgage credit
has grown very rapidly, with net lending increasing from close to
zero in 1994 to $35 billion in 1995 and $61 billion in 1996. The
surge of lending activity reflects stronger nonresidential
construction, a greater willingness to lend, and reduced loan
chargeoffs. Gross issuance of CMBSs soared in 1996, raising the
securitized share of commercial mortgage originations to about
55 percent. These securities are being purchased by insurance
companies and mutual funds, among other investors.
Household Finance
The growth of household debt appears to have edged above the
fourth-quarter rate. Fragmentary data for home-mortgage borrowing--
including the Mortgage Bankers Association index of mortgage
applications to purchase homes--indicate a fairly steady expansion.
Consumer credit growth picked up in January, although a slowing in
lending at banks (adjusted for securitization) in February suggests
some subsequent easing in overall consumer credit growth.
The January rebound in consumer credit was driven by a jump in
revolving credit (table). However, swings in this category are
especially large during the holiday season, so seasonally adjusted
growth rates are very sensitive to small variations in the pattern
of monthly charge volume or repayments. Averaging growth rates for
November through January, revolving credit expanded about 12 percent
at an annual rate, approximately the same as for 1996 as a whole.
Firms specializing in subprime auto loans have encountered
troubles of late. Intense competition has led to some erosion of
credit standards and smaller margins, which have reduced profits and
resulted in acute liquidity problems for some subprime specialists.
The difficulties of Mercury Finance and Jayhawk Acceptance have
received the most publicity. After Mercury announced that
"accounting irregularities" had inflated the firm's profits for the
past few years, rating agencies downgraded the company's debt,

leaving it unable to sell new commercial paper to repay maturing
paper and forcing it to default. Mercury recently won a loan
extension from Bank of America through early June, which will allow
it to continue operations and look for long-term financing. Jayhawk
reported a fourth-quarter loss related to substantially increased
provisions for loan write-offs, which placed the company in
violation of bank loan covenants and prompted it to file for
bankruptcy.
The problems of subprime auto lenders have been concentrated in
firms that focus on the highest-risk category of subprime debt,
which accounts for less than 10 percent of all subprime auto debt
and a minuscule share of total auto loans. In consequence, these
problems have had little impact on the availability or terms of
credit in the broader market for auto credit. New- and used-car
loan rates at the three captive auto finance companies in January
averaged well below their fourth-quarter values, while maturities
and loan-to-value ratios were in line with recent experience.2
The average new-car loan rate at banks in early February was
marginally below its level last fall.
Household loan delinquency rates deteriorated somewhat further
in the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of 1997
(chart). According to the Call Report, delinquency rates at
commercial banks increased in the fourth quarter for residential
real estate loans, credit cards, and other consumer loans. The
American Bankers Association series for delinquencies on credit
cards and other consumer loans also moved up. Moreover, the average
delinquency rate on loans at captive auto finance companies
continued to trend upward in early 1997, reaching another new high
at 3.6 percent in January (chart). Contacts at these companies have
said that the recent uptrend in delinquencies had been anticipated
and in part reflected earlier efforts to stimulate sales by making
credit more broadly available.3
The uptrend in credit card delinquencies and chargeoffs has
significantly affected some issuers' profitability and has also led
2. The steep drop in the interest rate for new cars partly
reflects deeply discounted rates at GMAC subsidized by the parent
company.
3. The delinquency rate also has been boosted somewhat--perhaps
0.10 to 0.20 percentage point in the past few years--by the shift
toward leasing from loans. (Leases are not included in the auto
loan delinquency rate.) Lease customers have tended to be better
credit risks on average, so their withdrawal from the loan market
has left a somewhat-higher-risk customer base for loans.

to tighter lending standards at many banks. Advanta Corporation, a
large "monoline" credit card issuer, announced this week that it
anticipated a substantial first-quarter loss. But industry contacts
have suggested that Advanta was late in addressing its more serious
problem areas and has just begun to take steps that many card
issuers had initiated as early as last spring. Consequently, these
contacts expect other issuers to report better earnings than
Advanta's and to have less need for additional restrictive
4measures. Indeed, the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey showed a smaller share of banks tightening credit card
standards in February than last November.
Treasury and Agency Finance
We anticipate that the first-quarter federal budget deficit
will be somewhat larger than in the previous quarter. This increase
will be financed by a larger drawdown of cash balances and some
quirks in the government's cash flow, leaving borrowing from the
public little changed at about $45 billion (table).5 However,
the composition of marketable borrowing will be substantially
different from that in the fourth quarter, with a sharp decline in
bills offsetting a pickup in coupon issuance.
Since the February FOMC meeting, interest rates on inflation-
indexed Treasury securities have generally moved with nominal rates,
but they have been decidedly less volatile. The spread between the
two rates has widened about 15 basis points over the period. This
pattern is consistent with an increase in expected inflation or
greater uncertainty about future inflation, as well as some backup
in real rates, but the thinness of the market--in terms of both
amount outstanding and trading volume as a share of that amount--
argues for caution in interpreting the relative rate movements.
Federally sponsored agencies have been active borrowers of
late. Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Federal Home
4. The magnitude of Advanta's expected loss surprised some
investors: In the two days after the announcement, its stock price
dropped nearly 25 percent. The share prices of other credit card
specialists also declined, but by less than 5 percent. The rating
agencies downgraded some of Advanta's debt obligations, but its
asset-backed issues retained their triple-A ratings, reflecting the
substantial investor protections provided by the spread accounts and
other enhancements.
5. These quirks include a drop in student loan disbursements
(which affect required borrowing dollar-for-dollar but change the
deficit only by the expected present value of the loss on the loans)
and various smaller factors.

III-14
Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) have recently issued so-
called global bonds, which are sold simultaneously in the United
States, Europe, and Asia. These transactions can involve more than
one currency: for example, Freddie Mac sold bonds for yen but will
redeem them in pounds sterling. Agencies have also launched their
first issues of inflation-indexed debt, with three-year to ten-year
notes recently sold by the Student Loan Marketing Association, the
Tennessee Valley Authority, and others.
State and Local Government Finance
State and local governments' issuance of long-term tax-exempt
debt remained light in January and February, as most municipalities
had tapped the market heavily in the fourth quarter to take
advantage of relatively low interest rates (table). Meanwhile,
short-term debt issuance rebounded in February from a weak January,
as governments borrowed in anticipation of tax receipts and other
seasonal revenue streams.
A number of state and local governments have announced plans to
sell taxable debt and to use the proceeds to reduce their unfunded
pension obligations. These governments appear to believe that the
pension funds can purchase assets whose return will over time exceed
the yield on the bonds being sold. In general, tax laws prohibit
the issuance of tax-exempt debt to purchase taxable assets. New
Jersey recently announced that it will sell $2.9 billion in taxable
pension bonds in March, the largest issuance of taxable municipal
debt on record.

Commercial Banking Developments
With fourth-quarter data now available, the Call Report shows
that domestically chartered commercial banks had another good year
in 1996 (top panels). Return on assets reached a new high just
above 1.2 percent, and return on equity stayed close to the elevated
levels of the past several years. The share of loans in total
assets continued to rise last year, helping to boost the net
interest margin slightly, and net non-interest income also improved
a bit. Despite the industry's well-publicized problems with
consumer loans, overall asset quality remains excellent, and
provisioning last year again was on the low side. Delinquencies and
charge-offs on other types of loans are near their lowest levels in
a decade, leaving the total loan portfolio in very good shape
(bottom panels).
With good asset quality and solid capital cushions, banks
continued to bid aggressively for large-dollar loan business, as
shown in the latest data from the Survey of Terms of Bank Lending,
taken in the first week of February (chart). Even though the spread
between the rates on loans over $1 million (those most likely to
involve investment-grade borrowers) and the intended federal funds
rate ticked up, it remained at the lower end of the range of the
last decade. Spreads for smaller loans held steady at the lowest
levels in several years.
Favorable supply conditions combined with strong demand to
produce another rapid expansion of business loans in February
(table), with large increases at both domestic and foreign banks.
The robust pace of mergers and acquisitions likely contributed to
the faster February loan growth. Real estate lending expanded at a
6 percent annual rate in February, with the home equity component
remaining below the elevated fourth-quarter pace. Reported consumer
loans ran off in February because of heavy securitizations, but even
with the securitized amounts added back in, consumer loans showed
only a weak expansion.
In the securities category, growth in adjusted securities
holdings picked up in February despite a drop in U.S. government
securities. The acceleration is partly attributable to the
acquisition by some banks of other banks' CDs for trading purposes.

Monetary Aggregates
Growth in the broad monetary aggregates has been relatively
brisk in recent months--especially M3. Banks have continued to
issue substantial amounts of large time deposits, partly to finance
credit expansion and partly to substitute for offshore borrowing.
This shift in funding patterns has been particularly strong at
foreign banks, where it may be related to an expansion of funding
operations in the United States. M3 has also been boosted by rapid
expansion of institution-only money funds (table). The month-to-
month growth of institutional money funds is influenced heavily by
fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, but over the
longer term, the growing share of these funds in M3 partly reflects
their more widespread use by nonfinancial corporations.
Nonfinancial businesses now hold about a third of institutional
money fund shares, up from a sixth in 1989, and institutional money
fund shares now make up 14 percent of the liquid assets of such
businesses, compared with 4 percent in 1989. These trends suggest
that firms may view money funds as a cost-effective substitute for
in-house cash management.
M2 expanded at about a 5 percent annual rate in February, quite
close to the pace recorded in the fourth quarter. Retail money
funds again grew more rapidly than deposits, as has regularly been
the case for several years. M2 growth apparently has tracked the
growth of nominal GDP fairly closely, a "normal" velocity pattern in
a period of minimal change in opportunity costs.
Mutual Funds
Net sales of stock and bond mutual funds declined somewhat in
February from January's torrid pace (table). The record January
inflow to stock funds was attributable partly to the seasonal peak
in investments in individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.
Stock fund inflows have continued to shift away from the more
aggressive growth funds and toward the more conservative growth and
income funds, whose share of total domestic net equity sales climbed
to about 60 percent in February from 42 percent last year.
Preliminary data suggest that net sales of stock funds weakened
somewhat in the first two weeks of March, with inflows again
concentrated in relatively conservative funds. The liquidity ratio
of domestic stock funds was about unchanged in January at
5.3 percent, holding at the lowest level since 1977 (chart).

The recent default of Mercury Finance on its commercial paper
obligations had a very limited impact on money market mutual funds,
as most funds apparently had little credit exposure to Mercury.
One fund management company bought Mercury's paper from the funds it
advises at par, thus maintaining the funds' share prices at $1 and
not "breaking the buck."

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In December, the U.S. deficit in trade in goods and services
widened from levels recorded in the previous two months. Exports
declined, particularly categories such as machinery and agricultural
products that had risen sharply in October and November. Imports
increased in December, largely oil, consumer goods, and machinery.
Trade data for January will be released on March 20, and will be
described in the Greenbook supplement.

For 1996-Q4, the trade deficit was significantly smaller than
in the third quarter, and was about the same as the average for the
first half of the year. Exports of goods and services were 5 percent
higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. The
increase was spread among all major trade categories except
automotive products (which were held down by the effects of strikes
against GM). Exports of aircraft and services rebounded from low
third-quarter levels. Exports of machinery and industrial supplies
moved to new record levels. Over the past year, the value of
merchandise exports rose 6 percent (Q4/Q4). Most of the rise went
to Mexico. Smaller increases went to Canada, South America, and
Asia. Exports to Western Europe were about the same in 1996-Q4 as a
year earlier.
Imports of goods and services in the fourth quarter were only
slightly higher than in the third quarter. Declines in automotive
imports from Canada (which were affected to a larger extent than
automotive exports by strikes against GM) nearly offset increases in
a wide range of other trade categories, especially imported consumer

goods, machinery (other than computers and semiconductors), and
services. Over the past year imports rose 8-1/2 percent (Q4/Q4)
with the increases spread over most major trade categories.
Exceptions were imports of semiconductors, which declined sharply
through most of the year and have only recently begun to move back
up, and automotive products from Canada.
Oil Imports
The value of imported oil was slightly higher in the fourth
quarter than in the third quarter, as a drop in quantity was more
than offset by a sharp increase in price.
The quantity of oil imported fell 8-1/2 percent (0.833 mb/d)
on average during the fourth quarter after rising 2 percent during
the third quarter. A larger than normal stock drawdown --
particularly in the U.S. territories -- and an increase in crude oil
production offset higher consumption and led to the lower rate of
oil imports. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics for
January and February indicate that oil imports into the fifty states
remain at the fourth-quarter rate.
The average price of imported oil in the fourth quarter was 14
percent above its third-quarter level. The price of imported oil
rose another 1-1/4 percent in January placing it 38 percent above
its December 1995 level. Skirmishes in the Kurdish region of
Northern Iraq, strikes in France that interrupted refinery
operations, and concern over the level of heating oil stocks in the
United States and Europe because of extremely cold weather in Europe
pushed prices up at the end of last year. Spot WTI declined $0.22
per barrel in January and plummeted $2.96 per barrel in February.
Deliveries of oil from Iraq put downward pressure on prices during
January, offsetting the effect of the cold winter. Mild weather in
February -- oil consumption was 0.7 mb/d below February 1996's rate
-- accompanied by the appearance of Iraqi oil on the spot market led
to the sharp fall in spot WTI. Spot WTI is currently trading in the
$20-22 per barrel range. The severe backwardation has disappeared
from the WTI futures market; the December 1997 futures quote is
currently just $0.80 below the current spot price.

Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in January
after edging up in December. The largest declines were for imported
capital goods, particularly computers and semiconductors. Partly
offsetting these declines was an increase, for the third consecutive
month, in prices of imported industrial supplies. For the fourth
quarter, non-oil import prices declined only slightly, as increases
in prices of industrial supplies and automotive products nearly
offset declines in other categories.
Prices of exports rose slightly in January. Prices of
agricultural exports, which had declined in the previous seven
months, edged up in January (primarily agricultural industrial
supplies). Small price increases were recorded in most other major
trade categories. In the fourth quarter, prices of agricultural
exports dropped about 30 percent at an annual rate. Prices of
nonagricultural exports changed only slightly in the fourth quarter,
with increases spread among all major trade categories except
computers and semiconductors.
Price data for February will be released on March 21.
U.S. Current Account through 1996-Q4
In the fourth quarter of 1996, the U.S. current account
deficit narrowed $26 billion SAAR. Smaller deficits for net goods
and services and net investment income were partly offset by larger
net unilateral transfers.
The deficit in goods and services narrowed $32 billion SAAR
largely because of the jump in exports. For net investment income,
the increase in income receipts (primarily from U.S. direct
investment abroad) was larger than the increase in income payments
to foreigners (on foreign investment in the United States). The
rise in unilateral transfers reflected U.S. Government grants to
Israel that are usually made during the fourth quarter of each year.
For the year 1996, the current account deficit was $165
billion, $17 billion larger than in 1995. About half of the change
was from goods and services and the other half from unilateral
transfers. Transfers were larger than usual for the year because
the Government shutdown at the end of 1995 pushed payment of some
grants to Israel from the fourth quarter of 1995 into the first
quarter of 1996.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities finished 1996
on a high note, with over $43 billion net in December, and continued
at a fast pace in January (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). For the year, records were set
for private net purchases of Treasury securities ($156 billion) and
corporate and other bonds ($121 billion) (lines 4a and 4b). Of the
record net purchases of corporate and other bonds in line 4b, about
$45 billion were for U.S. agency bonds. Most of the net private
purchases of U.S. bonds reported in line 4 went to international
financial centers in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, or Hong
Kong. Japanese residents purchased net $14 billion in corporate and
other bonds and $24 billion in U.S. Treasury securities. After the
first half of the year, foreigners showed virtually no interest on

IV-8
net in U.S. stocks (although there seemed to be some resurgence in
January; see line 4c).
U.S. residents continued very strong purchases of foreign
stocks and bonds through December (line 5). In January, however,
stock purchases were low and there was a net selloff of $3.4 billion
in foreign bonds. For the year 1996, U.S. net purchases of foreign
securities rose to $104 billion, a strong pace, but still below the
peak reached in 1993. As usual, most purchases were made in the
developed countries. Net stock purchases in Japan were over $10
billion in the first half of the year, but nothing thereafter; U.S.
investors also sold foreign bonds net in Japan in the second half of
the year.
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States
continued their robust growth in December and January (line 1);
partial information from the FRBNY for February indicates continued
large increases. For the year 1996, as was the case in 1995, only a
moderate part of this growth was associated with exchange market
intervention by G-10 countries; in both years, G-10 countries
accounted for only about 30 percent of the increase in foreign
official holdings in the United States.
Banks and securities dealers reported a continuation of
capital outflows in December and January (line 3). For the year,
net outflows through banks mounted to $60 billion; given the slower
growth in U.S. bank credit in 1996, banks relied more heavily on
domestic rather than foreign sources of financing. Moreover, about
$18 billion of the outflow represented RP transactions of securities
dealers with foreign purchasers of U.S. Treasury securities.
Recently released data on direct investment capital flows show
that both outflows (line 6) and inflows (line 7) were strong in
1996. Direct investment abroad was very strong in the fourth
quarter and finished the year close to the record total in 1995.
Much of the large increase in fourth-quarter outflow was the result
of a buildup of intercompany debt by finance affiliates in the
United Kingdom. The direct investment inflow to the United States
was almost as strong as the outflow, with much of it financing
mergers and acquisitions.

IV-9
The statistical discrepancy for the year mounted to a negative
$53 billion, indicating significant unrecorded capital outflows
during 1996.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets
The weighted average value of the dollar in terms of the other
G-10 currencies has risen 2-1/4 percent since the day before the
February FOMC meeting. The bulk of the dollar's gains came in
February, boosted in part by the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony. Most recently, strong U.S. data releases for retail
sales and employment have solidified the dollar's gains, with the
dollar now trading at levels last seen in February 1994.
The dollar's gains came mainly at the expense of the mark and
other continental European currencies. Movements in the dollar
against the mark appear to be related to changing views regarding
economic performance in Germany. Reports that sluggish economic
activity was increasing the chance that Germany would fail to meet
the EMU criterion of a three percent government deficit to GDP ratio
dropped the value of the mark more than one percent. Most of this
decline was reversed on the release of data showing strong growth in
M3 and a positive IFO survey. Expectations of a large increase in
German unemployment for February weighed on the mark in early March.
Since the middle of March, prospects of a delay in the start of EMU
appear to have boosted the mark. On balance, the dollar has
appreciated 2-1/2 percent against the mark since early February.
Other European currencies have lost value relative to the mark on
talk of an EMU delay. Most notable are the declines in the Swedish
krona and Italian lira against the mark, amounting to 2-3/4 and
1-1/2 percent respectively.
Sterling depreciated vis-a-vis the dollar, largely in March.
The drop in sterling's value was prompted by remarks from Chancellor
Clarke who made it clear that there was little chance of a rate
increase prior to the general election. Subsequently, Bank of
England Deputy Governor Davies stated that the pound was overvalued
against the mark. Prime Minister Major's announcement that the
general election would be held on May 1 also prompted sales of
sterling. Over the period as a whole, sterling declined 1 percent
against the dollar.
With regard to the yen, the dollar appreciated only slightly
over the past six weeks. Almost all of these gains came early in
the period on reports of Japanese financial firm difficulties.
Since the middle of February, the yen has appreciated 1 percent.

The yen's largest gains came on announcements in mid-February and
mid-March by Japan's Finance Ministry that the government may
purchase jusen-related land and that such land would be eligible for
securitization. Stock prices in Japan rose more than two percent on
both announcements. The yen also strengthened on data releases that
showed strong retail sales and healthy increases in industrial
output. A larger than expected increase in the Japanese current
account surplus for January, coupled with a statement from Treasury
Secretary Rubin that a sustained increase in the Japanese current
account surplus "was in nobody's interest," provided some further
support for the yen.
Short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries
are little changed on average, with a relatively large increase (47
basis points) in Belgium, where rates have risen with the unfolding
of a political crisis involving bribery of government officials. In
the Netherlands, official rates were increased twice, the latest
move coming on March 10, in an effort to maintain stability in the
guilder/mark exchange rate. The repurchase rate in Spain was cut 25
basis points after the release of favorable consumer price data. At
the other end of the maturity spectrum, long-term rate changes were
largest in Sweden, Italy, and Spain (averaging 48 basis points) on
prospects for a delay in EMU. Italian long-term rates, up 51 basis
points, have also been pressured by concerns over the passage of a
mini-budget. Ten-year interest rates in Switzerland fell roughly 20
basis points on continued lackluster economic performance.
The Mexican peso depreciated sharply in late February,
following the rise in U.S. interest rates and amid concerns over the
U.S. re-certification of Mexico as a drug-fighting ally. Earlier in
the month, Bank of Mexico officials announced procedures to
accelerate the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in the
event of a peso appreciation and to reduce the volatility of the
floating exchange rate in the event of a peso depreciation. The
accumulation of reserves will be accelerated by a second, mid-month
sale of dollar put options in the event that put options sold at the
beginning of the month are fully exercised. Volatility of a
depreciating peso will be reduced by an auction of $200 million on
any day when the peso depreciates by more than two percent. Only
one part of the new program came into play in February, when a

IV-13
second tranche of $300 million put options was sold after the first
tranche was exercised. The February 27 decline in the peso came too
late in the day to trigger an auction by the Bank of Mexico, and a
partial recovery of the peso prevented an auction the following day.
The Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market
over the period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent information suggests that the pace of expansion
continues to diverge across the major industrial countries. Japan,
Canada, and the United Kingdom posted strong GDP growth in the
fourth quarter, and first-quarter indicators generally have been
positive. In contrast, GDP growth was sluggish in the fourth
quarter in continental Europe, although confidence indicators have
improved in the past few months.
Inflationary pressures have generally remained subdued. In
Japan, wholesale prices have risen due to the depreciation of the
yen in recent months, but consumer price inflation remains near
zero. In Germany and France, CPI inflation is running under 2
percent, while in Canada it is slightly higher, and in Italy, it is
less than 2-1/2 percent, about half the rate recorded a year ago.
In the United Kingdom, in contrast, the underlying inflation rate
remained above 3 percent in January.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GDP rose 3.9 percent
(SAAR) in the fourth quarter after registering an upward-revised 1.3
percent increase in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter growth was
led by private consumption spending and a strong expansion of net
exports. Total investment declined as a significant increase in
business capital formation was more than offset by a plunge in
public investment.

Available indicators of economic activity for the first
quarter suggest continued economic expansion; industrial production
and machinery orders rose in January, and new car registrations
picked up on average in January and February, reflecting brisk
spending on big-ticket items in advance of the April 1 increase of
the consumption tax. The latest surge of spending on consumer
durables is also related to last year's strong housing cycle that
recently seems to have come to an end. Housing starts in January
fell further to a level almost 9 percent below the fourth-quarter
average.
The unemployment rate of 3.3 percent in January is only
slightly below its postwar high of 3.5 percent in May and June 1996.
The job offers/applicants ratio remained at 0.76 in January.
However, these figures mask a distinct improvement in the labor
market; in January employment rose strongly, the number of
unemployed dropped for the third consecutive month, and job offers
remained firm.
Japan's current account surplus rose sharply in January, to
$81 billion (SAAR) compared with a surplus of $67 million for all of
1996 and $112 billion in 1995. The surge in the current account

On March 5, the lower house of the Diet passed the budget for

Real GDP in Germany advanced at a pace of 0.3 percent (SAAR)
in the fourth quarter of 1996. Taking the year as a whole, real GDP
expanded 1.4 percent (or 2.2 percent on a Q4/Q4 basis). In the
fourth quarter, domestic demand was up modestly owing to a revival
of investment on machinery and equipment and inventory accumulation
(a residual in German GDP statistics). Private consumption,
government spending, and construction contracted in the fourth
quarter. While exports continued to grow rapidly (more than 20
percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter), a surge in imports
more than offset the increase in exports.
Only limited information is available for the first quarter.
Although industrial production dropped in January, output excluding
construction activity was up, and orders rebounded due to a surge in

export demand. Unemployment rose by a total of 150,000 (s.a.) in
January and February, bringing total unemployment to just over 4.3
million persons and the unemployment rate to 11.3 percent. However,
these figures likely are overstated because of effects from
unseasonably cold winter and a change in welfare registration
procedures. Inflation on a 12-month basis ticked up in January,
primarily reflecting increases in energy prices.
According to official figures, the general government deficit
as a share of GDP widened to 3.9 percent last year from 3.5 percent
in 1995. The Finance Ministry has revised its deficit forecast for
1997 to 2.9 percent of GDP (from 2.5 percent previously), owing to
an upward revision to the government's forecast for unemployment.
Given the importance of meeting the 3 percent deficit target
proscribed in the Maastricht Treaty, it is quite likely that the
Finance Ministry will impose a freeze on large federal expenditures,
a measure that has been implemented in each of the past two years in
order to give the Kohl government more flexibility over spending.
In mid-January, the government announced its proposal for
reform of the tax system that seeks to reduce marginal tax rates for
individuals and businesses and broaden the tax base by eliminating
deductions and loopholes. Altogether, the reform would provide tax

In France, real GDP rose 0.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth
quarter following an increase of 3.1 percent in the third quarter.
For 1996 as a whole, GDP increased 1.3 percent on average. While
strength in consumption underpinned overall activity last year,
growth last quarter was restrained by a decline in private
consumption; this decline followed the third-quarter surge
associated with the expiration of a government car-buying incentive
program. Negative calendar effects also restrained measured growth.
While growth of fixed investment slowed, owing to a slight decline
in business investment, inventories made a strong positive
contribution. Export growth slowed sharply and net exports
subtracted marginally from GDP growth.
Economic activity is expected to accelerate during the first
half of this year. Producers' expectations of future manufacturing
output improved further in January and February as foreign orders
strengthened; inventories appear to have returned to a more normal
level following a sizable decumulation last year. Consumption of
manufactured products rose in January despite a continued decline in

More recent information suggests that domestic demand has
continued to expand rapidly. Retail sales rebounded in January
following a drop in December and continued to rise in February; for
the two months on average, sales were 0.8 percent above the fourth-
quarter level. In addition, consumer confidence returned in January
and February to the high level recorded in November. Industrial
production was unchanged in January at a level about 1/2 percent
above the fourth-quarter average, as a rise in manufacturing output
was offset by a drop in the utility sector due to slightly warmer
weather. Business sentiment improved in January and February
following a sharp fall in December, but the index remains below the
high levels recorded in the fall, reflecting reduced expectations
for exports in response to the recent sharp appreciation of
sterling. The unemployment rate has continued to drop, reaching 6.2
percent in February, its lowest level in over six years. About half
of the one-percentage point decline since October has been
attributed to a tightening in the rules for unemployment
compensation and the rest to new job creation.

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 3.1
percent in January from a year earlier, well above the government's
target rate of 2-1/2 percent or less. Goods-price inflation has
declined over the past year despite a surge in petrol prices, while
services prices have accelerated. This trend continued in January.
Growth in average earnings has also picked up. The underlying rate
of increase of average earnings was revised up to 4.8 percent in
December and increased further to 5 percent in January, although
financial sector bonus payments may have biased the recent figures
upwards. However, producer input prices have dropped considerably
below year-earlier levels, in part a result of sterling's
appreciation over the past year.
Prime Minister Major announced March 17 that the next election

In Italy, real GDP declined a provisional 0.4 percent (SAAR)
in the fourth quarter, and growth for 1996 as a whole (year/year),
amounted to only 0.8 percent. Complete details will not be
available until mid-April. However, we do know that the
quarter-on-quarter drop was due, in part, to two fewer working days
than in the third quarter and to weaker exports.
Indicators for the first-quarter are very limited. Business
sentiment that remained weak in the last three quarters of 1996,

strengthened in January. Consumer confidence, which remains below
its 1996 average, rose in January but declined slightly in February.

After remaining stable at 2.6 percent for three consecutive
months, the consumer price index rose, on a year-over-year basis.
2.4 percent in February, less than half the rate recorded twelve
months ago. Inflation is very likely to remain stable in light of
continued moderation in wholesale and producer price increases,
reflecting both the appreciation of the lira over the past year and
a half and productivity gains due to containment of labor costs
since 1993.
In February, the government formally committed to presenting a
supplemental 1997 deficit reduction package by the end of March in
order to reach the Maastricht criteria on time. On February 21, the
official statistical agency of the EU, Eurostat, ruled permissible
the Italian accounting of taxes on wage funds and guaranteed
enterprise debt. As a result, Italy's 1996 budget deficit to GDP
ratio declined to 6.8 percent from 7.2 percent.
Economic activity in Canada expanded 2.9 percent (SAAR) in the
fourth quarter of 1996. Total domestic demand was very strong,
reflecting a rebound in consumption expenditures and residential
construction as well as continued strength in machinery and
equipment investment. Inventory accumulation also contributed to the

IV-22
quarter's growth, while net exports subtracted from growth. Exports
fell sharply, and in large part reflected the GM strike early in the
quarter. The increase in imports was accounted for largely by
computers and other machinery and equipment.

February, and the unemployment rate remained 9.7 percent in both
months. Housing starts picked up in January and February; for the
two months on average, starts were up 17.5 percent from the fourth-
quarter average. Manufacturing shipments recovered in January and
new orders increased sharply to a level 5.7 percent over the fourth-
quarter average. Headline consumer price inflation has picked up a
little in recent months but remains close to the midpoint of the
Bank of Canada's target range of 1-3 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, the strong expansion in economic activity in
Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil continues. In Venezuela, prospects
for a near-term recovery remain uncertain. In Asia, output growth,
although high, has slowed somewhat in China, but prospects look
better for Taiwan, which seems to have recovered from a mild
slowdown in 1996. The situation in Korea remains uncertain due in
part to recent industrial unrest and also due to the political
scandal after the second largest steel producer defaulted on a loan
payment. In Russia, the economy seems to be on the verge of a
turnaround.
Inflation for 1996 in the developing economies varied across
countries, but generally the trend was lower. The decline in
inflation rates for 1996 to single digits in Brazil and China is
notable. In Russia, inflation is higher than target inflation, but
considerably lower than last year's inflation. Prospects for a
further reduction in inflation in Venezuela disappeared after the
government agreed to public sector wage increases averaging 75
percent. External balances have worsened in Mexico, Brazil, and
Korea. For Mexico and Brazil, a pick up in aggregate demand is the
leading cause of this decline. For Korea, the deterioration of the
current account in 1996 was further exacerbated in January by the
impact of industrial unrest on exports. External balances have
improved in Argentina and Venezuela due to strong export growth in
Argentina (led by strong Brazilian export demand), and high oil
prices in Venezuela. In China, the trade surplus for 1996 was down
relative to 1995, but recently there has been strong export growth.
Individual country notes. In Mexico, the economy has
recovered more rapidly than previously expected from the sharp
downturn that followed the December 1994 devaluation. In the fourth
quarter of 1996, real GDP was 7.6 percent higher than the year-
earlier quarter. The increase was much higher than market
expectations of 5 to 5-1/2 percent. The sharp increase over the
previous four quarters more than offset the 7 percent decline
(Q4/Q4) in 1995, putting the level of GDP in the fourth quarter of
1996 for the first time above its pre-crisis level. For 1996 as a
whole, real GDP grew 5.1 percent from the previous year, following a
6.2 percent decline in 1995. The industrial sector led the way

IV-27
during 1996, with a 10.4 percent increase in production from 1995,
while the service sector showed a more moderate increase of 3.1
percent. On a seasonally adjusted basis, we estimate GDP to have
increased a robust 3 percent (not at an annual rate) in the third
and fourth quarters.
Recent data revealed a moderate worsening in the Mexican
current account picture. The current account deficit widened in the
fourth quarter of 1996 to bring the deficit for 1996 as a whole to
$1.8 billion, compared with a revised deficit of $1.6 billion for
1995 (previously reported to be only $0.7 billion). Monthly data on
the trade balance showed some improvement in December and January,
largely due to a moderation in imports, which had been growing
rapidly in previous months.

Consumer price inflation slowed in February to a monthly rate
of 1.7 percent, returning to the pace it exhibited last fall. That
is in contrast to monthly inflation of 3.2 percent in December and
2.6 percent in January, when the seasonal effects of greater
spending and bonuses paid during the Christmas season were
exacerbated by increases in the minimum wage and public sector
prices.
On February 19, Mexico announced a pre-payment of $590 million
to the International Monetary Fund, continuing the Mexican strategy
of pre-paying external debt in order to diminish the concentration
of payments due in 1998 and 1999. The funds for the pre-payment
represent half of the approximately $1.18 billion that Mexico will

IV-28
receive from two recent bond issues. The other half of the bond
proceeds will be used to build international reserves.
In Argentina, the upturn in economic activity has gained
further strength, but there are signs that inflation may be
increasing a little. Real GDP grew by a strong 9.2 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1996 compared with the same period a year ago,
bringing the year-over-year rate of growth for 1996 to 4.4 percent.
Industrial production was up 11.4 percent in January over a year
ago. Monthly consumer price inflation was 0.5 and 0.4 percent in
January and February, respectively. The January rise can be
attributed to a seasonal increase in tourism-related prices with the
onset of the Southern summer. The February figure is partly due to
a telephone tax rate increase, but also reflects to some extent the
recent pick up in domestic demand (monthly inflation in February
1996 was -0.3 percent).
The recovery in activity led to growth in imports of about 11
percent in 1996, but exports, led by strong demand from Brazil, more
than kept pace and grew by 14 percent last year, resulting in an
increase in the trade balance surplus from $3 billion in 1995 to
$3.8 billion in 1996. However, exports have fallen in January and,
according to preliminary data, the January 1997 trade balance shows
a deficit of $200 million, compared with a deficit of $70 million in
January 1996.

International reserves (excluding gold) were $16.5 billion at
the end of February 1997, higher than the year-earlier level of $14
billion. Peso and dollar deposits have grown strongly recently and

IV-29
reached $55 billion by year-end 1996. This represents a nearly 50
percent increase since June 1995, when deposits were at their lowest
point following the Mexican peso crisis. The public sector deficit
in 1996 was $5.8 billion (under 2 percent of GDP) and in line with
the revised IMF-agreed target of $6 billion. The January deficit
was $400 million, also roughly in line with the IMF-agreed target of
$1.04 billion for the first quarter of 1997.
In Brazil, real GDP grew at a revised 2.9 percent in 1996, but
this masks very strong growth over the last three quarters that
averaged 8 percent on an annualized basis. Growth was led by strong
performance in the service sectors (especially communications),
while industrial output grew by only 2.3 percent. Inflation has
continued to be remarkably low by Brazilian standards, despite the
lack of progress towards fiscal reform. The fiscal deficit on an
operational basis (which removes interest payments eroded in real
terms by inflation) was 4.5 percent of GDP in 1996, slightly lower
than in 1995, but the improvement owed to lower real interest
payments on public debt.

Strong aggregate demand has contributed to continued trade
deficits. The deterioration in the external balance in recent
months has put some downward pressure on the real/dollar exchange
rate. So far, however, the real/dollar exchange rate has continued
to depreciate slowly, and the government has maintained that there
will be no large devaluation. (As of mid-March, the real/dollar
exchange rate was 1.06 reais to the U.S. dollar.) International

IV-30
reserves stood at $59.4 billion at the end of February 1997,
slightly down from a peak of $60.5 billion in November 1996.
In Venezuela, developments in the labor market have fueled
further concerns about high inflation. In January, the government
awarded a 164 percent pay rise to striking public sector doctors,
which fanned other wage demands from the over 1 million public
employees. The government relented in late February and has agreed
to wage increases averaging 75 percent. The effects of this wage
settlement are expected to spill over to the private sector as well.
Thus, despite mildly encouraging consumer price inflation of 2.6 and
2.3 percent monthly for January and February, respectively, analysts
believe the government will miss by a wide margin its current target
of 25 percent annual inflation in 1997. The IMF is expected to
negotiate a new target inflation rate with Venezuela when it
concludes its second review under a $1.4 billion stand-by agreement
expiring in mid-July. The second review was underway in January
1997, but was suspended pending the outcome of the wage negotiations
and has not yet been renewed.

According to preliminary data, real GDP declined year-over-
year by 1.6 percent in 1996, with the oil sector expanding by 4.9
percent, but the non-oil sector contracting by 3.6 percent. The
recession has led to a narrowing of the non-oil trade deficit, which
over the period Jan-Sep 1996 was $3.8 billion compared with $4.5
billion over the same period in 1995. However, oil exports
increased markedly during 1996 and are estimated at $18 billion,
compared with less than $14 billion in 1995. The oil revenues have
also kept international reserves high, which at the end of January

IV-31
1997 stood at $12 billion (excluding gold), compared with $6.7
billion a year ago.
In China, the 12-month consumer price inflation rate fell to
6.8 percent in January, a marked decline from the 25.5 percent
recorded in 1994. Strong export growth led to a trade surplus of
$3.8 billion in the first two months of 1997, compared with a
deficit of $0.4 billion in the year-earlier period. The dollar
value of exports rose 21 percent, while imports fell 3 percent. The
official budget deficit for 1996/97 equalled 1 percent of GDP (note
that this does not count the sizable subsidies to state-owned
enterprises through the banking system); the government had forecast
a larger deficit, but tax revenue grew faster than expected.
China's foreign exchange reserves rose to $110 billion at the end of
February, up from $75 billion at the end of 1995.

The death in mid-February of China's supreme leader. Deng
Xiaoping, will likely have little effect on China's economy or the
pace of reform in the near term. Officially, the new leadership has
been in place for years, and leaders have pledged to continue
reforms. Over time, however, renewed leadership struggles may
develop, and the outcome may help, or may hinder, economic
developments. Financial markets reacted relatively little to the
news, which was widely expected. For example, Hong Kong's Hang Seng
index--which had fallen slightly the previous week amid rumors of
Deng's ill health--rose 2 percent on the first day of trading after
the news, and has remained relatively flat since.
In Taiwan, economic activity recovered strongly in the fourth
quarter of 1996 from a mild slowdown earlier in the year, with GDP
rising 6.6 percent from the year-earlier period. The unemployment
rate was 2.7 percent in January 1997 and has fallen fairly steadily

IV-32
since reaching its ten-year high of 3.2 percent in August 1996.
Inflation remained low, with consumer prices rising 2.0 percent in
February. Taiwan's trade surplus in the first two months of 1997
was $1.2 billion, compared with a surplus of $1.7 billion in the
year-earlier period. The dollar value of exports fell 1 percent
from a year earlier, while the dollar value of imports rose 2
percent. Foreign exchange reserves were $88.3 billion at the end of
February, up from its recent low of $83 billion in March 1996,
following Chinese missile tests near Taiwan.

In Korea, the Hanbo Steel Company, the country's second-
largest steel producer, defaulted on loan payments on January 23.
So far, the investigation into the financial collapse has led to the
arrests of several prominent bankers and politicians on charges of
bribery in connection with loans extended to Hanbo Steel. On March
5, President Kim appointed a new Prime Minister and a new Finance
Minister as part of a sweeping cabinet reshuffle intended to deflect
criticism of his handling of the Hanbo scandal.
Ruling and opposition parties struck a deal on March 10 on
amendments to controversial labor laws that had sparked widespread
industrial unrest for a month starting December 26. The compromise
allows for the formation of multiple umbrella labor groups, which is
a move aimed at legalizing the outlawed Korea Federation of Trade
Unions (KFTU) however, the formation of more than two unions at one
work site would not be permitted until 2002. Employers' groups have
accepted the amended bills, but the KFTU is threatening to wage a
general strike on May 1.
The impact of the labor unrest was reflected in the figures
for January's industrial production and external balances.

IV-33
Industrial production grew by 5.9 percent (year-on-year) compared
with a 12.4 percent rise a year earlier. Korea's trade and current
account deficits showed a sharp jump in January, in part due to the
adverse impact of the strikes on automobile exports.

In Russia, both the economy and the health of President
Yeltsin seem to be on the verge of a turnaround. January year-on-
year GDP growth was 0.1 percent, which was low but nonetheless the
first positive reading since the beginning of the reforms.
Similarly, Yeltsin made a strong showing at his first substantive
public appearance since his election nine months ago when he gave a
half-hour speech on the state of the country on March 6.
Yeltsin's return to full-time work may give a needed jolt to
economic reform, which had been stalled. Yeltsin signed a 1997
budget in late February, but also said that he considered the budget
flawed and not achievable. Moreover, on March 7 he initiated a
cabinet shakeup by naming the effective, but unpopular Anatoly
Chubais First Deputy Prime Minister. During the past week, Yeltsin
made additional changes, shifting the cabinet composition toward
reformers. Most notably, Chubais was also named Minister of
Finance, and the Economy Ministry absorbed the Defense Industry
Ministry and the Industry Ministry. There now seems to be hope that
a sorely needed tax code may be passed sometime during 1997,
although it may not be implemented until 1999.
Inflation for the first two months of 1997 came in at 3.8
percent, higher than would be consistent with the targeted annual
rate of 12 percent but still lower than last year's inflation for
the same period (1996 inflation came in at 22 percent for the year).
The ruble-dollar exchange rate has continued to remain well within

IV-34
the corridor set by the Central Bank. However, U.S. dollar
shipments to Russia remain higher than ever, and official Russian
statistics indicate that individuals spent one quarter of their
incomes on foreign currency purchases during the month of January,
1997.

Russia's three-year, $10 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility
was held up in October and November, but has been moving back on
track, with a double tranche released in January and another double
tranche expected soon. The IMF and Russia are working now on a plan
for 1997; the chief concerns are structural changes, including
restructuring of the energy monopolies, and revenue collection.
