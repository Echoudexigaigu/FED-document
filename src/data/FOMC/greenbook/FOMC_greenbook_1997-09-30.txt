Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic activity appears to have risen substantially further
this quarter, paced by brisk growth in consumer spending and a large
gain in business fixed investment. Overall manufacturing output
accelerated over the July-August period, lifting capacity
utilization, and brisk hiring has maintained a taut labor market.
Nonetheless, inflation has remained subdued.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand continued to grow strongly this summer. Net of
the direct effects of the UPS strike estimated by the BLS, private
nonfarm payrolls expanded slightly more than 200,000 per month on
average during July and August, in line with the pace over the first
half of the year. Aggregate weekly hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers for the first two months of the third quarter
averaged nearly 2 percent above their second-quarter level at an
1annual rate.
Among the major sectors, factory payrolls rose considerably
last month, 47,000, of which 10,000 reflected the return of striking
workers in the auto and steel industries. After adjustment for the
UPS strike, employment in the private service-producing sector grew
80,000 in August, after a surge of 295,000 in July. Payroll growth
during August in the services industries and retail trade--the two
main engines of job growth during the current expansion--was modest.
However, the slowing followed sharp rises in July, and smoothing
through the two months gives a picture of robust job growth so far
in the third quarter.
The household survey continues to point to tight labor markets.
Although the unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point in
August, to 4.9 percent, it was still very low by the standards of
the recent decades. The labor force participation rate held steady
for the fourth straight month at 67.1 percent, slightly below its
historical high of 67.3 percent reached in March.
1. The BLS estimates that the net decline in private employment
due to the UPS strike was 158,000. This includes the direct effect
of 185,000 striking workers, less a 27,000 offset in the air
transport and trucking industries. In addition, the U.S. Postal
Service temporarily hired 5,000 workers who were not counted in
private employment. We estimate that the strike had a negligible
effect on the average workweek. All told, the strike probably held
down measured aggregate hours in August approximately 0.2 percent.

Solid labor demand and tight labor supply are also evident in
other indicators of labor market activity. Initial claims for
unemployment insurance remain near their lowest level of the current
expansion. The Conference Board's Index of Help Wanted Advertising
held steady in July at just a shade below the historical high
reached in February. Similarly, the Manpower, Inc., Survey of Net
Hiring Strength for the fourth quarter points to strong labor
demand. This index is better as an indicator of employment growth
in the quarter in which the survey was taken (in this case, the
third quarter) than as a leading indicator. The surveys of
individuals also suggest a tight labor market; indeed, in the
Conference Board's Survey of Consumer Confidence, a record number of
respondents reported that jobs are plentiful.
Despite the consistent picture of apparent pressures in the job
market, recent data on average hourly earnings have revealed no
further wage acceleration. After having risen only 0.1 percent in
July, average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in August.2
On a twelve-month basis, average hourly earnings were up
3.7 percent--within the range prevailing for some months now.
The recent UPS settlement provides for wage gains that average
3 percent per year over the life of the contract for full-time
workers, who make up about 40 percent of UPS's union employees.
Wage gains for part-time workers will depend on tenure. Part-time
workers with at least five years of tenure will receive wage gains
averaging nearly 8 percent per year. Those with less tenure will
receive smaller increases. Given the high turnover of UPS's part-
time workforce, we expect that, on average, the wage increases for
UPS's part-time workforce will be in the area of 2 to 3 percent.
Unrelated to wages, the Teamsters won concessions on two of the key
issues in the strike: the creation of 10,000 full-time jobs by
combining part-time positions and the continuation of the system of
Teamster-run pension plans. However, the company prevailed in its
demand for a five-year contract. All told, on this analysis, the
settlement does not appear to signal an important departure from
prevailing labor cost trends.
2. The rate of rise in August was held down about 0.1 percentage
point by a shift in the composition of hours worked towards lower
paid industries. Most of the compositional shift is likely
explained by the UPS strike, which held down total hours in the
relatively highly paid transportation and public utilities
industries, and an increase in hours due to a spurt in the workweek
in the retail trade industry.

II-7
Output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector
is now estimated to have advanced 2.7 percent at an annual rate in
the second quarter, up from the 1.4 percent rate of increase in the
first quarter. Output per hour of all employees in the nonfinancial
corporate sector rose 3.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
bringing the increase over the past year to 2.4 percent. Largely
because of last quarter's surge in productivity, unit labor costs in
the nonfarm business sector increased just 0.5 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter and were unchanged in the nonfinancial
corporate sector. Over the past four quarters, unit labor costs
rose 2.2 percent in the nonfarm business sector and 1.1 percent in
the nonfinancial corporate sector.
Industrial Production
Industrial production grew 0.7 percent in August. In the
manufacturing sector, output rose a robust 1 percent, boosted by the
direct and indirect effects of a sharp bounceback in motor vehicle
assemblies and large increases in computers, semiconductors,
commercial aircraft, and primary metals. In addition, the output of
nondurables, which had been weak in the first half of the year,
rebounded in July and posted a further increase in August. The
factory operating rate rose to 83.1 percent in August, the highest
level since the spring of 1995. Outside of manufacturing, the
output of utilities and mines (mainly coal) dropped noticeably as a
result of this summer's unseasonably cool temperatures.
With regard to the data for prior months, growth in
manufacturing output for June and July was revised up 0.1 and
0.4 percentage point respectively. For the second quarter,
industrial production is now estimated to have risen 4.3 percent and
appears to be on track for a bigger gain in the third quarter.
Looking ahead, data on orders and other indicators of future
production continue to be upbeat (chart).
Motor vehicle assemblies rose to 12.3 million units at an
annual rate in August, following a month plagued by start-up
problems for new models and a strike. At the end of August,
days' supply of light trucks remained a touch on the high side,
while days' supply of autos was a bit lean. Motor vehicle
assemblies are scheduled to increase 650,000 units in September, but
weekly data suggest a smaller, 250,000 unit increase. The makers

the near term has lessened considerably, as only five local UAW
unions remain without a contract.

initial schedules for the fourth quarter, at a 12-1/2 million unit
rate, are similar to the pace of the past couple of months and seem
to anticipate a continuation of the recent pace of motor vehicle
sales.
Outside of motor vehicles, the production of consumer durable
goods fell back 0.6 percent in August, reversing a small part of the
surge over the preceding few months. Business equipment continued
to grow briskly, with strong gains registered in all major
categories. In particular, production of transit equipment rose
especially rapidly, in large part because of a continued ramp-up in
4production at Boeing. Construction supplies increased
0.4 percent, thereby making up about a third of their drop in July,
and the production of materials grew strongly again, with notable
strength in semiconductors and metals.
Sales of Light Motor Vehicles
Cutting through the monthly noise, the underlying pace of sales
of light motor vehicles has remained at about 15 million units over
the past few years. After adjustment for the extended reporting
periods by most firms, sales in August were near that rate.
While overall sales have held steady at a high level in the
1997 model year, the mix of sales has changed (chart). Notably,
domestic firms have lost market share, in part because foreign
firms, particularly Japanese manufacturers, have pursued aggressive
pricing strategies made possible by cost-cutting measures and
favorable exchange rate movements. The Big Three have responded by
maintaining incentives in the relatively high range that has
prevailed since early 1995.
Another major development over the past year has been a series
of strikes, primarily at General Motors. The strikes at General
Motors have caused periodic supply shortages, leading the company to
delay fleet sales in order to better serve the retail market. With
its most recent strike settled in late July and start-up problems
largely resolved, model availability at General Motors improved
noticeably in August. Not surprisingly, the company's fleet sales
4. Although Boeing continues to increase its production, the firm
recently announced that it is having problems finishing several
planes due to "parts shortages, a stretched supplier base, and an
influx of new employees." As a result, Boeing stated that it was
postponing until the fourth quarter the delivery of 12 of the 36
planes originally scheduled for September.
5. The reporting periods for these firms were extended through
September 2. If, as expected, the reporting periods for this month
end on September 30, sales for September will be understated.

(confidential) surged last month, making up for most of the
shortfalls earlier in the year (chart). Although weakness in retail
sales in August may have allowed General Motors to close more of the
gap in fleet sales than it had anticipated, we expect that the
company will hold fleet sales a bit above trend through the end of
the year in order to fully recoup earlier shortfalls.
The near-term outlook for sales remains quite positive. The
preliminary September results from the Michigan survey indicated
that consumers' attitudes toward buying conditions for cars are
favorable, largely a reflection of the view that "times are good."
Pricing, from the consumers view, also remains attractive. On
comparably equipped vehicles, prices announced by the Big Three for
the 1998 models have been little changed; price increases on
foreign-nameplate models have been modest. In addition, initial
industry plans for incentives in the fourth quarter, while down from
the level of the current quarter, remain relatively high.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending grew at a healthy rate in August after having
picked up smartly in June and July. Available indicators suggest
that spending is continuing to grow in September. Moreover, nothing
would seem to be in the way of further significant gains: Income
and job growth are solid; consumer confidence is high; and
households have experienced large gains in net worth.
According to the advance report, an upward-revised gain of
0.9 percent in total nominal retail sales in July was followed by an
increase of 0.4 percent in August. Spending in the retail control
category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building
material and supply stores, rose 0.3 percent last month after having
increased 1/2 percent per month in June and July. Gains were
especially large at general merchandise and apparel stores, a
reading consistent with anecdotal reports of strong back-to-school
sales last month; durable goods stores also registered strong
growth. The August retail sales report, together with available
information on prices, suggests that real PCE for goods excluding
motor vehicles in July and August was about 1 percent higher than
the average level in the second quarter (not at an annual rate).
Real spending on services rose 0.4 percent in July, the latest
month for which data are available. Expenditures on energy services
rose 1.1 percent in July (on a seasonally adjusted basis), following
an unusually cool June. According to national weather data,

temperatures in July and August were somewhat below normal, while
September temperatures have been normal; these data suggest that
energy spending will be little changed in August and rise in
September. Spending on non-energy services increased 0.4 percent in
July, with most categories of services registering solid growth.
Estimates of personal income are available only through July,
when real disposable personal income edged down 0.1 percent. Income
was held down by the decline in the average workweek and the nearly
flat average hourly earnings reported in the July employment
release. Aggregate hours and average hourly earnings both rose in
August, suggesting that private wage and salary disbursements will
show a sizable gain for the month.
Readings of sentiment for August and early September continued
to show that consumers have highly favorable views of economic
conditions. The Conference Board index moved back up in August to a
level just below June's 28-year high. The Michigan SRC index, which
slipped a bit last month, reversed much of its decline in early
September and returned to its historical high recorded in July.
Overall, both the Conference Board and Michigan surveys show
consumers to be highly optimistic about business conditions and
labor market prospects. In addition, measures of inflation
expectations have tended to edge down over the past year.
Housing Markets
The drop in housing starts last month was somewhat surprising,
given indicators of demand. Starts of single-family units declined
in August to a 1.07 million unit annual rate, compared with the
average pace of 1.14 million units over the first seven months of
the year. Adjusted permits for these units, which we view as a
better indicator of the underlying trend in construction, also
declined in August but by less than starts.6
Indicators of housing demand have remained upbeat: Income and
employment have continued to show healthy gains, mortgage rates are
relatively low, and consumer assessments of homebuying conditions
are quite positive. Indeed, the recent trends in sales are
favorable. The average level of new home sales in June and July was
7-1/2 percent higher than that over 1996 as a whole, and sales of
existing homes have been running ahead of the record-setting 1996
pace. Among the more timely indicators of activity, builders'
6. Adjusted permits are equal to the published permits series,
plus starts outside of permit-issuing places, plus an adjustment for
units started without a permit in permit-issuing places.

ratings of new-home sales improved further in both August and
September, and applications for mortgages to finance home purchases
have continued to run at a relatively high level in recent weeks.
Multifamily starts were at a 291,000 unit annual rate in
August, compared with an average pace of 319,000 units during the
first seven months of this year. Permits for these units also
declined last month but less than starts. The level of multifamily
starts was low relative to permits in August, suggesting that
multifamily starts likely will rebound some in September.
Business Fixed Investment
Outlays for producers' durable equipment are continuing to grow
rapidly. Shipments and orders of nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft have posted exceptional gains in recent months. In
addition, outlays for nonresidential structures show signs of
recovering from the declines of the past two quarters.
The boom in expenditures on producers' durable equipment
continues to be led by office and computing equipment. These
outlays advanced at an annual rate of 46 percent in the second
quarter and do not appear to have slowed since: Nominal shipments
of office and computing equipment in July were 6 percent above their
second-quarter average level. In addition, the price of computing
equipment has been falling even faster than usual--the PPI for
computers dropped 2.8 percent (monthly rate) in August, a decline
likely reflecting price cuts for Intel microprocessors. Anecdotal
reports from industry sources suggest the possibility of further
large price cuts on personal computers in the coming quarters.
Shipments of communications equipment rose 2.9 percent in July
to a level 6 percent above the second-quarter average. Smoothing
over the recent zigs and zags, the orders picture for communications
equipment also looks healthy.
The current-quarter outlook for producers' durable equipment
outside the high-tech sector is also positive, For transportation
equipment, sales of heavy trucks picked up in July, and fleet sales
of light vehicles recoverd from their low levels of earlier this
year. Although Boeing will not fully meet its announced delivery
schedule for September, aircraft production has risen rapidly this
quarter, and domestic deliveries are likely to post a large gain
over the quarter as a whole. Shipments of capital goods excluding

high-tech and transportation equipment advanced 0.7 percent in July,
and the high level of orders points to further growth.
Real expenditures on nonresidential structures appear to be
rebounding somewhat in the current quarter after moderate declines
in the first two quarters of this year. The value of construction
put in place rose in July for the third month in a row and now
stands 2-3/4 percent above its second-quarter average. Looking
forward, although construction contracts have been moving sideways
in recent months, low vacancy rates, rising prices for commercial
real estate, and widespread availability of financing through REITs
suggest that conditions for further gains in nonresidential
construction are good.
Business Inventories
After a sharp run-up in the second quarter, investment in
business inventories slowed in July. For manufacturing and trade
excluding motor vehicles, inventories rose at an annual rate of
$26 billion (book value) in July, considerably below the second-
quarter pace of $49 billion, as the June bulge in accumulation at
wholesalers was partially reversed.
In manufacturing, inventories increased at a $26 billion annual
rate in July, an advance similar to the second-quarter pace. As in
recent quarters, a sizable portion of the accumulation was in stocks
of nondefense capital goods--especially aircraft and parts, computer
and office equipment, and communications equipment--where shipments
and orders have increased notably and production has been brisk.

July was due to an increase in orders for search and navigation
equipment, which is unlikely to be sustained. Excluding this
category, orders still grew a very strong 4-3/4 percent rate.

Aside from capital goods, stocks of non-auto consumer goods--
household durables, and home goods and apparel--also expanded
substantially in July after a moderate increase in the second
quarter. However, given the pickup in non-auto retail sales in July
and August and the expected strength in consumer spending in coming
months, the recent accumulation of consumer goods inventories was
probably intentional. For most industries and market groupings in
manufacturing, inventory-shipments ratios in July remained around
the lower end of their recent ranges.
Wholesale inventories declined in July after a massive buildup
in June. The July drawdown was largely in durable stocks and in
many cases coincided with very strong wholesale shipments in that
month. For instance, stocks held by distributors of machinery fell
$10 billion in book-value terms, while shipments of wholesale
machinery surged 3 percent. In the wholesale sector as a whole,
stocks appear to be well in line relative to sales.
In retail trade, investment in non-auto inventories picked up
somewhat in July from the preceding two months but remained
generally moderate. Notably, sales at stores selling general
merchandise, apparel, and furnishings (GAF) have been quite brisk
since late spring, and the inventory-sales ratio fell in July to the
lowest level in recent years.
Federal Sector
News on the deficit front continues to be good. With data for
eleven months of the fiscal year (October 1996 to August 1997) now
complete, the unified deficit is down $62 billion from the same
period last year, adjusted for shifts in payment timing and
excluding deposit insurance and proceeds from spectrum auctions.
The drop in the deficit is a result of strong receipts (up
8-1/2 percent), most notably from personal income and social
insurance taxes (up 9-1/4 percent). Adjusted outlays have grown
3-1/4 percent so far this fiscal year, 1 percentage point faster
than they did over the first eleven months of fiscal 1996. The
acceleration has been concentrated in two areas: defense spending,
which has edged up after several years of declines, and the "other"
spending category, principally nondefense discretionary spending,
8. Despite the huge increase shown in the preliminary report last
month, wholesale inventory investment in June was revised up in the
final estimate, albeit only modestly. Excluding motor vehicles,
wholesale inventories are now shown to have increased $44.7 billion
in June and $14 billion (annual rate) over the second quarter as a
whole.

which is up $8 billion this year after having declined $13.5 billion
last year. The slowdown in spending for health care programs has
continued into this year.
The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional
Budget Office released revised budget projections for fiscal 1997-
2007 earlier this month. The estimates are in close agreement,
projecting deficits of about $35 billion and $55 billion for fiscal
years 1997 and 1998 and surpluses beginning in fiscal 2002. These
budget projections are much more favorable than those made earlier
this year. The improvement results in part from the recently passed
reconciliation legislation and from a substantial upward revision to
the CBO's estimates of taxable incomes that now closely aligns their
forecast with that of OMB. In addition, both agencies have lowered
their deficit estimates for technical reasons, mainly to reflect the
windfall in tax receipts this year. Information on the sources of
the windfall remains limited, but both OMB and CBO assume that only
a portion of it is permanent.
The economic assumptions underlying the OMB and CBO budget
projections are very similar. Both expect real GDP growth to slow
to the area of 2 percent in 1998-2000, which allows unemployment to
rise back toward their estimates of the NAIRU.9 Over the longer
run, both agencies expect real GDP to grow at about its potential
rate, and the unemployment rate to hold steady. They expect
inflation to be about 2-1/2 percent per year as measured by the GDP
price index and 2-1/2 to 3 percent per year as measured by the CPI.
Both agencies forecast the rate on ten-year Treasury notes to fall
to the neighborhood of 5-1/2 percent by the year 2000 in part
because of the reduction in the budget deficit.
Although none of the thirteen regular appropriations bills for
fiscal 1998 have been signed into law, most analysts expect most of
the bills to be in place before the end of the fiscal year on
September 30. With the current Budget Resolution calling for
roughly $20 billion more in new budget authority than was legislated
last year, appropriations have not been seriously hindered for lack
of money. However, progress has been slowed by disagreements over a
few policy issues, including the methodology for the 2000 census.
9. CBO's estimate of the NAIRU remains at 5.8 percent, and OMB
continues to cite 5.5 percent as the middle of its estimated range
for the NAIRU. CBO expects potential GDP to increase 2.4 percent
per year over 1997-2002 and 2.3 percent per year over 1997-2007 as a
whole. OMB expects potential GDP to rise 2.4 percent per year
throughout the ten-year period.

II-32
pay increases for members of the Congress, and a pilot program of
school vouchers for the District of Columbia. A short stopgap
spending bill is expected, if necessary, to fund programs without
completed appropriations.
State and Local Governments
As reported by the BLS, state and local employment has soared
in recent months, with job gains averaging 82,000 per month from May
through August. Much of this rise, which compares with an average
monthly increase of 17,000 over the two years ended May, was at
local educational establishments. Although we anticipated some
pickup in school-system hiring this year, the recent acceleration in
local educational employment is probably an artifact of difficulties
with the seasonal adjustment procedure. Notably, analysts at BLS
are testing alternatives that they hope to put in place next March.
Above-trend increases during the previous two summers were followed
by large declines in September, and we would not be surprised to see
a similar pattern this year.10 Real state and local construction
spending has trended down since last winter after having risen
moderately, on net, over the preceding two quarters.
According to preliminary findings by the National Conference of
State Legislatures, the aggregate general fund balance for fiscal
1997, which ended in June for most states, was 7.3 percent of
general fund spending, the highest ratio since 1980, when it stood
at 9.0 percent. With forty-seven states reporting, none showed a
deficit.11 Despite having underpredicted their revenues in each
of the past four years, states remain conservative in their
expectations for the coming year and are forecasting year-end
balances to fall to 5.2 percent of spending in fiscal 1998, a ratio
still quite high by historical standards. Uses of the unexpected
revenues this year went to rainy day funds, one-time outlays,
capital projects, and debt reduction, among other things. As in the
two prior years, states enacted tax cuts during fiscal year 1997,
but the reduction was smaller than in either 1995 or 1996.
Prices
The news on inflation continues to be very favorable. The
consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in August, the same pace as in
10. Employment rose 64,000 per month, on average, over the three
months ending in August 1996 and fell 34,000 in September. In 1995,
employment grew 24,000, on average, over the three summer months and
fell 22,000 in September.
11. Alabama, North Carolina, and Wisconsin are not included.

July. On a twelve-month change basis, the CPI has remained in the
neighborhood of 2-1/4 percent since May, down from nearly 3 percent
in August of last year.
The CPI for energy advanced 1.7 percent in August, pushed up by
a 5.4 percent increase in gasoline prices. The price of gasoline
jumped because a surprisingly strong late summer driving season
pushed up demand for gasoline and some minor refinery disruptions
held down supply. As these factors unwind, price pressures are
likely to ease. Indeed, recent survey data point to a considerably
smaller increase in retail gasoline prices in September. In
contrast to gasoline, heating oil prices moved down 0.7 percent
further in August. As refiners expanded gasoline production to meet
strong demand over the summer, they also boosted output of heating
oil, and--in contrast to recent years--stocks are now ample.
Retail food prices advanced 0.4 percent in August. The
volatile index for fruit and vegetables jumped 2.8 percent, while
other food prices were up only 0.1 percent. Relative to a year
earlier, consumer food prices were up 2-1/2 percent, about
1 percentage point less than in the preceding twelve months.
For items other than food and energy, consumer prices increased
just 0.1 percent in August and registered a modest twelve-month
change of 2-1/4 percent--a deceleration of about 1/4 percentage
point from the year-earlier pace. Prices of goods other than food
and energy, which have been damped noticeably by the appreciation of
the dollar over the past few years, decelerated slightly more than
those of "core" services. Among goods, the flat price of new motor
vehicles and the decline in the index for used cars have been
particularly notably, accounting for about two-thirds of the
0.3 percentage point deceleration in the core CPI over the past
twelve months.
Turning to the details of the August rise in the core CPI,
the 1 percent drop in apparel prices reflected the slower-than-usual
12introduction of higher-priced fall and winter merchandise.12 By
contrast, tobacco prices moved up in August in response to increases
12. Fall and winter merchandise tend to enter the sample at a
higher price than the outgoing summer merchandise, which tends to
be discounted by the end of the summer. Because a greater share of
fall and winter items are expected to enter the sample this
September than is typical, seasonally adjusted prices should rise;
last year, when apparel prices also fell 1.0 percent in August for
the same reason, more than half of the decline was reversed in the
following month.

in the prices of smoking products other than cigarettes. In early
September, tobacco companies announced wholesale price hikes for
cigarettes, which are expected to boost retail tobacco prices
further.13 Prices of services excluding food and energy rose only
0.2 percent in August--a shade less than in recent months--as
airfares tumbled. More recently, however, airlines have posted fare
increases, which are likely to be picked up in the September
CPI.14
Other broad measures confirm the recent quiescence of
inflation, but none shows the deceleration apparent in the CPI over
the past year. Among other expenditure price measures, core PCE
prices accelerated 1/4 percentage point over the past four quarters,
in contrast to the small deceleration in the core CPI. However,
this follows a sharp deceleration in core PCE prices over the
preceding year: over the past several years, these measures have
shown similar amounts of deceleration. Measures of product prices
show low and stable inflation over the past four quarters.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations as measured by the Michigan index
have moved a bit lower over the past year.
The PPI for capital goods also has been restrained recently,
remaining flat last month after having edged lower in July. In
August, computer prices fell considerably as the latest round of
price cutting by chipmaker Intel began feeding through to computer
prices. At earlier stages of processing, prices have remained
relatively subdued. The PPI for intermediate materials other than
food and energy picked up a little over the past month but still
barely registered an increase over the past year. For crude
materials less food and energy, prices rose in August; however,
since the mid-August pricing date for the PPI, the Journal of
Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price indexes have moved lower.
13. The recent budget deal increased cigarette taxes 10 cents in
2000 and another 5 cents in 2002. As for the broader tobacco
settlement, many political hurdles still remain. If approved, such
a settlement likely will lead to additional cigarette taxes and
price increases over the next decade or so.
14. Full-price (or business) fares, which account for only about
one-tenth of the fares sampled in the CPI, increased roughly
5 percent. Discounted leisure fares, which receive most of the
weight in the CPI, also increased, although apparently not on all
routes. In addition, some analysts have suggested that airlines
will soon come back with sales on some leisure fares.

Agricultural Production, Inventories, and Prices
According to the Agriculture Department's latest assessment,
farm supply prospects changed little during the month of August.
Based on survey evidence that was collected around the start of
September, the agency nudged down its 1997 production forecast for
wheat but held its forecasts for corn and soybeans essentially
unchanged. Changes for other crops were mixed; for example, cotton
prospects improved noticeably as a result of favorable weather in
Texas and some other states, but tobacco and peanuts were hurt to
some extent by dry weather in the Southeast. Production prospects
for livestock were raised slightly, as downward revisions to the
USDA's current-year forecasts for pork and poultry were more than
offset by upward revisions for beef and milk. Summation of these
various pieces of physical product data suggests that real aggregate
farm output is headed for a moderate increase this year.15 By our
calculations, increases of the past two years have essentially
reversed a 1995 decline, returning total farm output to about its
1994 record high.16
Inventories of farm crops have increased a bit from the lows of
late 1995 and early 1996, and the levels of production and
consumption being predicted by the USDA appear likely to result in
further moderate accumulation of these inventories over the coming
year. In dollar terms, buildups that are predicted for soybeans and
wheat should more than offset an anticipated reduction for corn,
stocks of which are expected to remain fairly low both in absolute
terms and relative to expected levels of usage. In the livestock
sector, inventories of cattle appear to be headed for a second year
of decline in 1997, but growth in the number of hogs and pigs
appears to be picking up.17
15. Valued at 1996 prices, as in the accompanying chart, the rise
in farm output this year appears likely to be close to $5 billion.
16. With the crops having made it past mid-September without
extensive weather damage, the risk of such major losses in the
current growing season would appear to have greatly diminished.
Still, in some years at least, significant revisions have been made
to the crop estimates in October or November (or even in January of
the following year). Over the past ten years, the final estimates
for corn and soybeans have differed from the September estimates by
roughly 5 percent, on average. Changes for wheat from this point
forward have been considerably smaller--less than 1-1/2 percent on
average.
17. The national income and product accounts show real farm
inventories accumulating at a rapid pace in the first half of 1997.
However, these estimates of farm inventory accumulation look high
(Footnote continues on next page)

II-38
With production having expanded during the past two years and
inventories of farm crops not quite so tight as they were in late
1995 and the first half of 1996, farm prices have fallen back from
the peaks of a year ago. According to the USDA, the index of prices
received by farmers in August 1997 was about 8-1/2 percent below the
level of a year earlier; the index had gone up about 15 percent over
the preceding twelve months. Prices of crude foods in the PPI have
displayed an even bigger swing, falling 14 percent during the most
recent twelve months after a rise of about more than 20 percent from
August 1995 to August 1996. Futures prices as of mid-September
suggest that declines in crude food prices should persist on a year-
to-year basis at least into the early part of 1998 but at a slower
rate than over the past year. El Nino--the weather disturbance in
the Pacific that is attracting so much attention in the popular
press--does not yet appear to have had much impact on prices in the
futures markets. The price of the December 1997 contract for corn
has changed little, on net, since last spring, when evidence of a
new El Nino first began to appear; and the prices of late 1997
contracts for wheat and soybeans have declined.
(Footnote continued from previous page)
compared to estimates that we are deriving from physical product
data. In the past, current-year estimates of farm inventory
accumulation in the national accounts often have been revised by
sizable amounts in the following year in conjunction with annual
benchmark revisions.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Yields on intermediate- and long-term securities moved higher
after the August FOMC meeting. News pointing to relatively robust
economic growth, along with the minutes of the July meeting that
suggested a fairly strong bias toward tightening by the FOMC, led
market participants to see somewhat higher odds on tighter monetary
policy over the intermediate term. The rate increases were
subsequently reversed, however, as data for August implied some
moderation in growth and surprisingly tame inflation. On balance,
yields on Treasury notes and bonds are down between 5 and 15 basis
points since the last FOMC meeting.
Money market rates show mixed changes, with private rates
holding steady while the three-month Treasury bill yield dropped
24 basis points. The Treasury has not gone as far as market
participants had expected in boosting the issuance of three-month
bills, and the relatively tight supply has helped push down yields
on these issues.
Stock markets remained volatile over the intermeeting period.
Prices of the larger-capitalization stocks had fluctuated below July
peaks until quite recently, when the Dow Industrials and S&P 500
stocks rallied strongly as bond yields fell. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ
and Amex composite indexes posted new highs in September; and prices
of small-capitalization stocks soared, pushing the Russell 2000
index up nearly 10 percent to a record high.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses has remained strong in the
third quarter. Issuance of corporate bonds has been brisk, though
down some from the surge in July, and growth of bank loans to
businesses has jumped to double digits. In the household sector,
growth of consumer credit perked up in July from June, but year-
over-year increases have been trending down, and consumer lending by
banks remained damped in August and early September. Mortgage debt
indicators point to continued moderate growth in the third quarter.
Federal borrowing has been light as the Treasury has chosen to
finance the federal deficit for the third quarter largely by drawing
down its sizable midyear cash balance. Relative to the past few
years, state and local governments have increased their net issuance
of long-term debt to fund new capital outlays. M2 posted a rapid
advance in August, about double the pace in June and July; the
acceleration owed largely to heavy inflows to retail money market

funds that likely were diverted from equity mutual funds when stock
prices slumped in mid-August.
Business Finance
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations slowed to
a $16 billion rate in August, below the record pace in the June-July
period but still above the average rate earlier in the year (table).
Data for the first three weeks of September suggest that issuance
has remained near the pace of August. Offerings of investment-grade
securities continued to be bolstered by funding for several large
mergers and acquisitions. Also, some proceeds from recent bond
offerings were used to pay down short-term debt, which sharply
slowed the growth in outstanding commercial paper in August after
two months of rapid expansion. But nonfinancial commercial paper
resumed its growth in September as companies financed merger
activities and corporate tax payments.
Speculative-grade bond issuers--mainly in the high-technology,
telecommunications, and oil sectors--continued to take advantage of
relatively favorable interest rates to finance capital expenditures.
As a result, junk bond issuance has accounted for nearly half of
total nonfinancial bond volume, somewhat above the high share
recorded in the late 1980s (chart, bottom left). Meanwhile, strong
investor demand has held spreads in the junk bond market near
historic lows. Inflows to junk bond mutual funds have remained
strong. Also, junk bonds' appeal to more conservative types of
institutional lenders has grown through repackaging into
collateralized bond obligations.
Recent data continue to paint a rosy picture for overall
business credit quality. The dollar value of Moody's downgrades in
July and August was small and about matched upgrades. Moreover,
Moody's listing of companies currently under review is very short,
implying little further net change in ratings over the next few
months. No defaults of junk bonds were reported in August (chart,
bottom right), keeping the default rate over the past few months
near the lowest level in almost a decade. Business failures have
risen this year, but they remain well below the pre-1994 rate. Over
the past several months, failures were lifted by bankruptcies of
some firms in the retail sector. These bankruptcies were not a
surprise, however, as the companies, which included Montgomery Ward
and Levitz Furniture, had been having difficulties for several
years.

Gross equity issuance in August was less than $3 billion, but
the summer lull in issuance appears to have ended in recent weeks.
In August and the first half of September, first-day returns to IPOs
were the highest in over a year, and fewer new issues, on net, sold
at a discount to their filing prices (chart, upper left). Strong
demand for new issues encouraged additional firms to file
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in August, thereby boosting the inventory of prospective equity
issues for the fall.
Overall, nonfinancial corporations continue to retire a greater
volume of equity than they issue, as mergers and share repurchases
remain brisk. The total dollar amount of equity retired through
mergers likely will fall short of last year's near-record volume but
only because some of this year's largest deals have been structured
as stock swaps that result in no retirement of equity (chart, top
right). Recent announcements by corporations point to a heavy
volume of share repurchases through the rest of this year (chart,
lower left).
After soaring to record highs in early August, the S&P 500
index fell sharply and finished the month down 6 percent--its
largest monthly drop in seven years. Investors were perhaps a bit
skittish after the large July gains in stock prices pushed the
expected earnings yield on S&P stocks further below the thirty-year
bond yield (chart, lower right). Shares of large multinational
corporations were especially vulnerable amid growing concerns that
their third-quarter earnings would be limited by weaker sales
abroad, owing to the strengthened dollar and currency devaluations
in Southeast Asia. Subsequently, in September, prices recovered the
lost ground as bond yields fell, and the S&P is now up nearly
5 percent for the intermeeting period.
Meanwhile, shares of smaller companies have fared consistently
well since mid-August. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
capitalization firms has risen almost 10 percent over the
intermeeting period, and the Amex, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 indexes
posted successive new record highs. Still, small-capitalization
stocks have risen less, on balance, this year than large-
capitalization stocks.
Household Sector
Growth of household debt appears to have slowed in recent
months. Although total consumer credit rebounded to a 6-1/2 percent

annual rate in July, the rise followed much slower growth in
previous months (table), and bank data suggest growth remained
sluggish in August and early September. Expansion of mortgage debt
also slowed in the second quarter, but more recent indications point
to a return to the moderate pace of earlier in the year.
Interest rates on new mortgage loans have declined about
15 basis points, on net, since the August FOMC meeting. With
mortgage rates around 7-1/2 percent on average in recent months,
many households apparently have found it desirable to finance a home
purchase. For instance, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)
index of applications for home purchase loans remains near its
highest level (chart, upper panel), while the refinancing index has
remained noticeably below its recent peak (lower panel). The MBA
purchase index may overstate somewhat the current level of home
sales, because lower long-term mortgage rates in recent months have
led to an increase in the fixed-rate share of total loan
originations. Compared with other lenders, mortgage banking firms
originate a higher proportion of fixed-rate loans and are somewhat
overweighted in the MBA survey. However, MBA staff believe that any
overstatement is not large enough to be materially misleading.
The latest information on household credit quality suggests
that the deterioration of the past couple of years may be abating.
According to the MBA loan delinquency survey, mortgage delinquencies
fell in the second quarter by about the same amount that they had
risen in the previous two quarters, putting the mortgage delinquency
rate near its average of the past five years (chart, upper panel).
Also, Call Report data indicate that the already low percentage of
problem real estate loans at banks declined in the second quarter.
The net charge-off rate for all real estate loans at banks also
remained extremely low.
Problems with consumer loans seem to be stabilizing, though the
picture is still mixed. According to Call Report data, the steady
uptrend in bank delinquencies on closed-end consumer loans, such as
auto loans, appears to have leveled off in the first half of 1997,
although the comparable ABA series continued to rise (chart, middle
panel). At the captive auto finance companies, the delinquency rate
edged lower in the second quarter from a historical high, then
dropped sharply further in July. Call Report data indicate that the
delinquency rate on bank credit cards was about unchanged in the

the American Bankers Association (ABA) (chart, lower panel).
Government Finance
Treasury borrowing from the public in the third quarter should
total only about $7 billion (table, top panel), and the Treasury's
$51 billion midyear cash balance likely will be drawn down to less
than half that size at this quarter's end. Recent marketable
borrowing needs have been more than met with coupon issues--
including five-year indexed notes auctioned in July. Weekly bill
auctions have been trimmed by $1 billion, and with essentially no
new net issuance, the relative "shortage" of bills continues--
keeping bill rates low relative to other yields.
The rally in bond markets earlier in the quarter spurred a
pickup in advance refundings of municipal bonds in July and August.
Some of the proceeds from these issues were placed in nonmarketable
Treasury issues (SLGS). Municipalities wishing to defease
outstanding and noncallable bonds could also meet their need for
Treasuries in the strips market, where gross purchases increased to
more than $4 billion in August, double the pace of earlier months
this year.
Government-sponsored enterprises have continued to tap global
markets for funds. For example, the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae) has recently issued $750 million in global
bonds denominated in Australian dollars, and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) announced that it plans to create
an overseas investment fund aimed at making its mortgage-backed
securities more attractive to European institutional investors.
The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) was
converted to a private holding company (SLM Holding Corporation) in
August. SLM is a private corporation, not a government-sponsored
enterprise, and Sallie Mae has now become a wholly owned subsidiary
of the holding company. Sallie Mae, as a separate entity, will be
dissolved by September 30, 2008.
Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt totaled $15 billion
in August, a bit below its July and second-quarter pace (table). As
in July, total offerings were bolstered in August by a hefty volume
of refunding issues. Yields on tax-exempt bonds fell in August to
about 30 basis points below levels of last spring, and lately they
have edged even lower, creating conditions that might stimulate
additional refunding volume.

For the year, issuance of long-term municipal securities is up
nearly 10 percent relative to the same period in 1996. Although
refundings have been strong recently, much of the year-to-date rise
reflects financing of new capital outlays. Retirement of
outstanding debt has declined substantially in 1997 because the
bulge in advance-refunded obligations was largely worked down in
1996. In dollar terms, net issuance of long-term municipal debt has
totaled $24 billion for the first eight months of this year,
compared with only $1 billion for the same period of last year.

Bank Credit
Bank credit decelerated in August because of a drop in security
holdings (table). The weakness was mainly in U.S. government
securities. Total loan growth was up in August, to a 7 percent
annual pace. Lending to businesses was brisk and probably reflected
borrowing to finance mergers and acquisitions and possibly some
inventories. Loan growth in early September appears to have slowed,
especially for business loans.
Results for the August Survey of Terms of Business Lending
(STBL) showed spreads on loans larger than $1 million rising
10 basis points and those on loans of $1 million or less falling a
bit (chart). Although average spreads have trended down since the
end of the recession, there has been a noticeable uptick of spreads
on large loans since the middle of 1996. This movement is at odds
with reports in the financial press of continued erosion in spreads

and with results from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
indicating spreads on loans to large borrowers have narrowed over
this period. Merger and acquisition activity, particularly
involving less than mega-sized firms, has heated up lately, and
because these mergers more often tend to be bank-financed, such a
shift toward these generally riskier loans might explain the
increases in large-loan spreads reported in recent STBLs.
Meanwhile, real estate loans grew moderately in August as home
equity loans decelerated slightly. The growth of consumer loans at
banks, even after adjusting for securitizations, was subdued at a
meager 2 percent annual rate. The latest sluggishness in consumer
loans seems to reflect the overall reduction in demand for credit by
households rather than tightening of terms or further shifts toward
home equity loans.
Data from the June 1997 Call Report (chart) indicate that
charge-offs of consumer loans continued to climb, although other
loan quality measures seem to be improving. Business loan quality
continues to be good, with charge-offs low and delinquencies edging
off further. Indeed, with little change in the provisioning for
loan losses in recent quarters and a continuation of solid net
interest margins, the net income of banks remained robust in the
second quarter at about 1-1/4 percent of average total assets.
Mutual Funds and Monetary Aggregates
Net sales of stock mutual funds are estimated to have slowed to
$13-1/2 billion in August, about half the exceptionally large volume
recorded in July and considerably below the second-quarter pace
(table). Data for September suggest that net sales of stock funds
have picked up, with growth funds leading the way, although the
overall rate may not reach that recorded early in the summer. Net
sales of bond funds remained strong in August but appear to have
slowed in September.
Sizable declines in the stock market in mid-August raised
questions among some analysts about the ability of stock mutual
funds to withstand a high volume of redemptions. Mutual funds can
satisfy redemptions by selling off liquid assets or by tapping an
established line of credit. Industry contacts report that lines of
credit with banks--especially committed lines--have become more
common in recent years and are often arranged with a lead bank and
shared with several other banks through participation agreements.
The typical size of a committed line of credit is reported to be on

the order of 5 to 10 percent of the fund's assets. As of August,
liquid assets of stock funds totaled $128 billion, or 5-1/2 percent
of total assets--a liquidity ratio that, while low by historical
standards, still exceeds all previous net redemption experiences.
In the October 1987 stock market crash, for example, net redemptions
for the month amounted to 4 percent of total assets. Thus, in the
aggregate, the industry appears to have satisfactory access to
liquidity, although individual funds could still experience some
difficulties in meeting their redemption requests.

The acceleration of the monetary aggregates in August reflects
both a surge in demand deposits, which tend to be volatile, and
shifts in portfolio preferences of retail investors. The main story
for M2 was the acceleration in growth in retail money market mutual
fund assets, which soared up at an annual rate of 33 percent in
August: the mid-August decline in stock prices and heightened
volatility likely induced some investors to redirect money away from
equity stock mutual funds. The non-M2 components of M3 decelerated
last month to about half of July's torrid pace but growth remained
robust at a 17 percent annual rate. As a result, M3 grew faster
than M2 and moved further above its annual range.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In July, the deficit in U.S. trade in goods and services widened to
$10.3 billion as exports declined and imports rose.
The 1-1/2 percent decline in total exports in July reversed the
increase recorded in June. Most categories of exports decreased with the
exception of capital goods where there were moderate increases in
machinery and aircraft deliveries. The level of exports of goods and
services in July was about 3/4 percent less than the average of the
second quarter.
The 1 percent increase in imports in July followed a decline in June
and was spread among almost all trade categories. The largest increase
was in automotive products, three-fourths of which were vehicles from
Canada which rebounded from a decline in June. Imports of consumer goods
turned up after two months of decreases. The level of imports of goods
and services in July was 1 percent higher than the average of the second
quarter.
Trade data for August will be released on October 21.

In nominal terms, the trade balance was about the same in the
second quarter of 1997 as in the fourth quarter of 1996. However,
real net exports weakened $26 billion SAAR over the same period.
resulting in a negative contribution to real GDP growth of three-
fourths of a percentage point over the first half of the year. U.S.
real exports of goods and services grew at a 15 percent annual rate
in the first half of 1997. The increase was spread among most major
trade categories (especially aircraft and other capital goods) and
was directed particularly towards countries in Latin America and

Canada. Healthy increases were also recorded for exports to Western
Europe and developing countries in Asia. Real imports grew at a 19
percent annual rate in the first half of 1997, with increases spread
among all major trade categories.
Oil Imports and Prices
The quantity of oil imported during 1997-Q2 was sharply higher
than rates recorded during 1997-Q1 and also well above rates
recorded last year. Imports in July were 2 percent above 1997-Q2
rates. Imports were driven by extremely strong consumption in the
second quarter--up three percent from rates observed a year ago--and
a building of oil stocks. Inventory accumulation induced the rise
in imports in July as oil consumption slowed from its strong second-
quarter pace. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate
that oil imports remained strong in August due to high consumption
demand.
The price of imported oil which peaked at $22 per barrel in
the fourth quarter of 1996 fell to $18 per barrel by the second
quarter of 1997. Deliveries of oil from Iraq and mild weather that
lowered the demand for heating oil allowed firms to rebuild
inventories from near historic lows and removed the upward pressure
on prices that had characterized the market for the past year.
Import prices declined slightly in June and July and rose 2.2
percent in August.
The price of spot WTI rose $0.30 per barrel in August and
averaged $19.93 per barrel, reflecting the delays in Iraq's
shipments under U.N. supervision and the interruption of exports
from Colombia due to repeated bombing of the oil pipeline by
terrorists. Prices have been moving in the $19-20 per barrel range
in September.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports declined slightly in July and
August after recording little change in the previous two months.
This decline was primarily the result of lower computer prices, and
to a lesser degree, lower prices for all other major end-use
categories with the exception of automotive products and industrial
supplies. For July-August combined, the decline was 1.3 percent at
an annual rate, less than decreases recorded in the previous two
quarters.

Prices of exports increased slightly in August, following
three months of decline. This increase was primarily the result of
higher agricultural export prices, and to a lesser degree, higher
prices for exported consumer goods. For July-August combined, the
decline in prices of exports was attributable to agricultural
products. Prices of nonagricultural goods rose marginally.
U.S. Current Account through 1997-Q2
The U.S. current account deficit narrowed $4 billion SAAR in
the second quarter. A smaller deficit for net goods and services (a
jump in exports exceeded the growth of imports) was partly offset by
larger net unilateral transfers and net investment income payments.

The increase in net investment income payments was entirely in
portfolio transactions as payments rose about twice as much as
receipts. Net receipts from direct investment leveled off in the
second quarter after declining in the first quarter from the very
strong fourth-quarter rate. Receipts from U.S. direct investment
abroad and payments on foreign direct investment in the United

IV-7
States both increased. Receipts from abroad increased strongly in
manufacturing and other industries as a result of robust foreign
demand. Payments continued their strong rebound from the downturn
in 1996-Q4; they now stand 29 percent higher than the level in the
second quarter of 1996.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreigners continued to acquire U.S. securities at a
rapid pace in July. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table.) Foreign purchases of U.S. bonds
(other than Treasuries) picked up a bit from June and remain on a
path to match last year's record total (line 4b). Foreign purchases
of U.S. equities also picked up in July (line 4c). Net equity
purchases have been running at a very high rate throughout the year,
with the total through July reaching $44 billion. This compares
with net purchases of $12 billion for all of 1996. As with the
other securities, foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries remained
robust in July and here again the trend for this year points to a
total near last year's record.
Foreign official reserves in the United States were little
changed in July (line 1), as a modest reduction in G-10 reserves was
offset by an increase in reserve holdings of Brazil and Mexico.
Partial data for August from FRBNY indicate a $13 billion increase
in official reserves in the United States, with developing countries
in Asia accounting for most of the increase. Even with this latest
increase, foreign official inflows have been small since the first
quarter of this year, and the total through August is likely to be
on the order of $30 billion. This is in sharp contrast to last year
when official reserve accumulation averaged more than $30 billion
per quarter. The slowing from last year is primarily attributable
to developing countries in Asia. This group increased official
reserves in the United States significantly last year and reduced
them this year. Several of these countries drew down their dollar
reserves in efforts to support their currencies this year. In
addition, China shifted a substantial portion of its dollar reserves
to custodians outside of the United States. Reserve accumulation by
developed countries has been only slightly slower than last year,
while developing countries in Latin America have increased reserves
in the United States at a rate roughly equal to that of last year.

U.S. net purchases of foreign securities remained strong in
July, bringing the total for the first seven months of this year to
$57 billion (line 5). This is similar to last year's record-setting
pace.
U.S. banks recorded large net outflows in July (line 3),
reflecting in large part increased lending to unaffiliated
foreigners in offshore financial centers. On a monthly-average
basis, U.S. banks increased their net claims on foreign affiliates
in both July and August, with most of the increase attributable to
foreign-based banks in the United States. (See lines 1 and lb of
the International Banking Data table.)
In addition, recently released balance of payments data for
the second quarter show significant outflows associated with
transactions between banks outside the United States and U.S.
nonbank residents. Credit extended to U.S. nonbanks declined by
several billion dollars in the second quarter and Eurodollar
deposits of U.S. nonbanks increased by $15 billion (lines 4 and 5 of
the Banking table). These transactions account for roughly half of
the "other" outflow shown on line 9 of the Summary table.
The balance of payments data also show a continuation of
robust direct investment capital flows both into and out of the
United States (lines 6 and 7 of the Summary table). Of the direct
investment outflows, roughly half was directed toward Western
Europe. Foreign direct investment inflows into the United States
were swelled by substantial lending by foreign companies (largely
banks) to their U.S. finance affiliates.
The statistical discrepancy in the second quarter was $-17
billion--the same sign and slightly larger than that recorded in the
first quarter.
Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period since the August FOMC meeting, the foreign
exchange value of the dollar has exhibited divergent trends against
the major currencies. Against the mark, the dollar has declined
2-3/4 percent, amid market commentary that the Bundesbank will
tighten at least once more before the middle of next year. In
contrast, the dollar has risen 1-1/2 percent against the yen. on a
continuing flow of data showing weak economic conditions in Japan.

may also have weighed on the yen, eroding the price competitiveness
of Japanese exports. Furthermore, the financial turmoil in the
region may also have raised concerns about Japanese investments in
those countries.
These differing patterns against the mark and yen correspond
to similarly divergent movements in the weighted average indices of
the dollar's foreign exchange value against the 18 currencies of
industrial and developing countries used in our model forecasts.
The index with multilateral (global) trade weights, used in our
forecasts of U.S. exports, has declined 1-3/4 percent on balance
since the August FOMC meeting. Over the same period, however, the
index with U.S. import weights, used in our forecasts of U.S. import
prices, has declined only 1/4 percent.1
The shift in view on Bundesbank tightening was supported by
data released during the period that showed an acceleration in the
pace of economic activity in Germany and a creeping higher of
consumer price inflation. Bundesbank President Tietmeyer noted
publicly the possibility of tightening before the decision on EMU
membership is made in the spring of 1998. In addition, the
Bundesbank altered its standing practice of announcing a week or two
in advance the rate at which its fixed-rate RP operations would be
conducted. Instead, it has chosen to wait until immediately before
its weekly RP operations to announce the terms on which they would
be done, setting the stage for a quick rate hike.
Movements in the prices of three-month euromark futures
contracts are consistent with an increase in expectations for a
tightening by the Bundesbank in the first part of next year, with
rates up about 10 basis points on the March and June contracts for
1998. Expectations for a hike in rates before the end of this year,
however, do not appear to have changed significantly during the
intermeeting period; the three-month interest rate is little changed
at nearly 25 basis points above the Bundesbank's current RP rate.
1 The Federal Reserve Board Staff index of the dollar's foreign exchange
value against the currencies of the other G-10 countries, which uses
weights based on multilateral trade flows from 1972-1976, has declined
1-7/8 percent during the intermeeting period.

IV-13
The yield on the bellwether bond declined modestly--in line with the
decline in the comparable U.S. Treasury security yield.
EMU optimism continued to rise during the period, as favorable
budget news in Italy helped to diminish further any expectations
that the start of monetary union would be delayed for some or all
countries. In addition, an announcement following the September
meeting of EU finance ministers and central bank governors seemed to
inspire further confidence that monetary union would begin on time.
The ministers and governors agreed that the bilateral conversion
rates of the currencies taking part in the monetary union would be
revealed at the time the initial membership is announced next
spring. European asset markets seemed to reflect that confidence.
Long-term interest rates in Italy and Spain declined 54 and 41 basis
points, respectively, during the period, narrowing their spreads
with the comparable German rate by roughly one-half. The French
franc firmed about 1/4 percent against the mark, bringing it closer
to its bilateral central rate against the mark--the exchange rate at
which many believe the franc and mark will be locked upon entry into
monetary union. The Irish pound, which has been trading well above
its central parities with the other prospective EMU currencies,
declined 2 percent against the mark during the period.
The souring of the outlook for economic activity in Japan over
the past 5 weeks has prompted a decline of 16 basis points in the
Japanese government bond yield to a record low. Equity prices also
slid further, with the Topix index declining 4-1/2 percent on
balance over the period. The three-month interest rate in Japan was
little changed, however, reflecting the unchanged prospects for an
easing of monetary policy.
The term structure of interest rates in the United Kingdom has
turned from flat to inverted during the intermeeting period, with
the three-month rate up 6 basis points and the ten-year yield down
39. Signs that economic activity in the United Kingdom is slowing
and expectations the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee may
nonetheless tighten once more have contributed to the yield curve
movement.
In other currency developments, the dollar has depreciated
more than 5-1/2 percent against the Norwegian krone and the Swedish
krona and declined 3-1/2 percent against the Swiss franc. In large

IV-14
part, these currencies have firmed against the dollar along with the
mark and other European currencies. The Scandinavian currencies
rose further on the back of above-trend growth in Norway and Sweden
and large external surpluses. In addition, concerns have arisen in
market commentary that political changes will prompt a shift toward
more expansionary fiscal policies and possibly tighter monetary
policies, although interest rates in these countries do not seem to
be registering such concerns. The Swiss franc moved higher in
reaction to signs that economic activity in Switzerland is picking
up and to remarks from Swiss National Bank President Meyer
indicating that inflationary pressures may be building.
Several southeast Asian currencies have continued to
depreciate during the period. The Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit
have depreciated another 9-1/2 percent and 8-1/4 percent,
respectively, against the dollar, while the Philippine peso slid
another 7-3/4 percent. In contrast, the Indonesian rupiah moved
down only 1-7/8 percent, reflecting a judgement by the market that
the response of Indonesian authorities to the fundamental economic
imbalances that prompted these market pressures has been more
appropriate than that in other countries. Developments in these
countries are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere in Section IV.
The Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during the
intermeeting period.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Although the pattern of quarter-to-quarter growth has been
disrupted by special factors in some countries, second-quarter GDP
data confirm that growth in the first half of the year solidified in
most major industrial countries. Expansions in Canada and the
United Kingdom continued at healthy paces. Growth in Germany,
France, and Italy picked up, indicating that modest recoveries are
underway amid signs that domestic demand may be firming. Available
third-quarter data suggest that the stronger performance has
extended into the current quarter in all five countries. In
contrast, an unexpectedly sharp contraction of Japanese domestic
demand in the second quarter, along with further weak data from the

IV-15
current quarter, has renewed worries about prospects in Japan for
sustained recovery.
Inflation rates remain low, although concerns have heightened
in some countries as the pace of recovery has quickened. In
Germany, consumer-price inflation has continued to edge up and in
August exceeded 2 percent for the first time in almost 2-1/2 years.
However, rates of inflation are near 1-1/2 percent in other major
industrial countries.
Individual country notes. In Japan, second-quarter GDP was
surprisingly weak, falling 11.2 percent (SAAR) from its level in the
first quarter. Consumption plunged 21 percent, reversing the surge
of expenditures before the April hike in the consumption tax.
Private investment also declined sharply, with plant and equipment
investment falling after posting increases in the previous nine
quarters. Public investment, however, rebounded somewhat from sharp

drops registered in the previous two quarters, offsetting a decline
in government consumption. External demand made a strong positive
contribution to growth. Exports grew robustly, reflecting the
competitive level of the yen; imports contracted.
Economic indicators for the third quarter suggest some
improvement, although domestic demand appears to have remained weak.
In July, industrial production was up a revised 1.7 percent, with
the government projecting a 0.6 percent increase for the third

IV-16
quarter as a whole. However, July retail sales and household
expenditures were essentially unchanged from second-quarter levels,
and housing starts declined sharply. Labor-market conditions were
little changed in July, with the unemployment rate and the offers-
to-applicants ratio remaining at second-quarter levels. In
contrast, machinery orders continue to be strong, with overall
orders rising by 0.6 percent and private orders rising by 5.9
percent. Consumer-price inflation remains subdued.
Third-quarter external trade data suggest a continuation of
second-quarter trends. Exports remain strong, and there is little
evidence of a rebound in imports.

Real GDP in Germany advanced 4.1 percent (SAAR) in the second
quarter, up from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter, owing to a
surge in exports. Domestic demand contributed little to growth, as
a rebound in private consumption expenditure from its laggard first-
quarter pace and modest growth in government and investment spending
were largely offset by a drawdown in inventories. (Inventories are
a residual in the national income accounts and can be subject to
substantial revision.) Investment on machinery and equipment, which
had registered respectable growth rates in the fourth quarter of
1996 and the first quarter of this year, advanced at a sluggish

IV-17
pace. Exports, aided by the decline in the mark, rose more than 15
percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.

Data for the current quarter suggest that the expansion has
continued. Industrial production and manufacturing orders continued
to increase strongly, and the IFO business climate survey, an
indicator of current and expected conditions in industry, rose
significantly further. Conditions in the labor market remain
stagnant, however, with the all-German unemployment rate at 11.6
percent in August. The rise in unemployment reflects to some extent
the termination of government subsidized work programs and weakness
in the construction sector in the eastern states, where the
unemployment rate rose to 18.8 percent in August. Inflation at the
consumer level has risen in recent months, registering 2.1 percent
in all-Germany over the year to August and a preliminary 1.8 percent
in the western states over the year to September. This acceleration
in prices owes in part to rising import prices. An additional
factor pushing up prices at the consumer level has been a change in
the share of medical prescription costs paid by consumers, which
increased in July and will affect the year/year measure of inflation
until July 1998.

from last-year's government-sponsored car-purchase incentive scheme
and a late start to the summer sales season. The slight increase in
investment reflected uncertainty about the outcome of the recent
parliamentary elections and the outlook for a sustained expansion in
final domestic demand. Favorable calendar effects accounted for
about 1 percentage point of the measured GDP growth.
Net exports and consumption are expected to support continued
expansion in the current quarter. Consumption of manufactured
products rose about 3 percent in July-August relative to the second
quarter. The rebound in consumer spending, which was anticipated,
reflects in part the 4-percent hike in the minimum wage and the rise
in back-to-school allowances. Business confidence in July remained
firm; foreign demand continued to boost production expectations, and
inventories were judged be about normal. At just under its post-war
high, unemployment edged down slightly in July. Consumer-price
inflation accelerated in August owing to increased energy, food, and
government-controlled prices. However, inflation in manufactured
goods and services remained subdued.

On September 24, the French government presented its 1998
budget package to the National Assembly. The package is designed to
reduce the general government deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 1998
from a targeted 3-1/4 percent in 1997. The central government
deficit is projected to decline 1/4 percentage point of GDP to

IV-20
3.1 percent of GDP. The social security budget, to be presented on
October 8, is projected to register a small deficit in 1998, while
local authorities/other administrations accounts should continue to
record a surplus. The budget is based on an official forecast of
3 percent growth in real GDP growth. The 1998 budget does not
include "exceptional" transfers such as transfer of France Telecom
pension assets that was included in this year's budget.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 4 percent (SAAR) in
the second quarter. Consumption expenditures and fixed investment
were especially strong. Net exports subtracted from growth, as
imports grew more rapidly than exports.

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity continued to
expand at a robust pace in the third quarter, although more forward-
looking indicators point to a slowing in the pace of activity ahead.
Industrial production increased further in July, reflecting strong
domestic demand. According to the Purchasing Managers Survey,
manufacturing industries expanded further in August, but the rate of
growth slowed sharply, and new export orders declined for the second
consecutive month. Retail sales for July and August were up 1.7
percent from the average volume in the second quarter. Household
spending has been boosted in recent months by "windfall gains" of
shares that consumers have received as several building societies
have converted into or merged with commercial banks. Current
estimates suggest that about 16.5 percent of the expected windfall

IV-21
gains in 1997 will be spent this year, amounting to about 1 percent
of total consumer spending.

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.8
percent over the year to August, somewhat above the government's
inflation target of 2-1/2 percent for underlying inflation.
However, much of the recent change in inflation reflects special
factors, such as the petrol tax imposed in the July budget. Annual
nominal earnings growth remains moderate. When earnings are
adjusted for the impact of bonuses, the rate of growth in underlying
earnings has been largely unchanged at slightly under 4-1/2 percent
since early this year. The official claimant unemployment rate
dropped further in August to 5.3 percent, the lowest rate since
August 1980. The unemployment rate derived from the Labor Force
Survey for the March-May period was 7.2 percent, its lowest reading
since the Spring 1990 survey.
In Italy, real GDP rose a provisional 6 percent (SAAR) in the
second quarter. Final figures and details on the composition of
second-quarter growth will be available at the end of September.
The accelerated pace of growth in the second quarter is attributable
in part to a greater number of working days than in the first
quarter, to higher net exports, and to strong industrial production.

IV-22
The government's highly successful tax incentive scheme continued to
provide stimulus to Italian auto manufacturing.
Third-quarter indicators are limited, but available data
suggest further expansion. In July, new car registrations leapt for
the sixth consecutive month, with growth in auto sales averaging
close to 40 percent higher than in July 1996. Consumer confidence,
which rose significantly in the first quarter and remained
relatively flat in the second quarter, rose in July and August.

Italian inflation remains at record low levels. In September,
the consumer price index was up a preliminary 1.4 percent on a 12-
month basis. Although short-term price movements suggest that the
deceleration in inflation has come to an end, a significant pick-up
in CPI inflation is not likely in the near term.
The rift on welfare reform between the center-left coalition
and the Communists remains wide. As part of his 1998 budget, Prime
Minister Prodi hopes to include cuts in health care spending and
pensions, which the Communists adamantly oppose. The 1998 budget
proposal, which will outline the extent of intended reforms, will be
presented to the parliament by the end of September. Under Italian
law, the parliament is required to approve the budget by the end of
December.

The Canadian economy expanded strongly in the second quarter,
as real GDP rose 4.9 percent (SAAR). Growth was boosted by a rise
in domestic demand of nearly 7-1/2 percent, while strong growth in
imports exerted some drag on the economy. Consumption continued to
grow at a rapid pace, despite the very low level of the savings
rate; the ratio of personal savings to disposable income is now
below 1 percent.

Preliminary indicators for the third quarter point to
continued expansion. Employment, which rose substantially in the
second quarter, edged up in July and expanded more rapidly in
August. Despite the increase, the unemployment rate remained at 9
percent in August, as rapid labor force growth offset greater demand
for labor. Consumer prices rose 1.8 percent over the year to
August, up a bit from the second-quarter average.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In the major Latin American and Asian countries growth has
remained steady in recent months, although there is some evidence of
a slight slowdown in Taiwan. Inflation rates in these countries
have been low to moderate with no general signs of an increase.
External balances in most Latin American countries and Taiwan have
deteriorated. By contrast, in Korea the trade deficit has decreased
and in China the trade surplus has increased.
Financial markets have remained volatile in many of the ASEAN
countries and their currencies have been depreciating against the
dollar. Policy responses to the currency turmoil in these countries
have been varied.
Individual country notes. On August 20, the IMF approved a
stand-by credit for Thailand, authorizing drawings of up to about
$4 billion over the next three years to support the government's
economic program. The stand-by credit is equivalent to 505 percent
of Thailand's quota. Thailand has also received pledges of
financial support totaling $13.2 billion from other Asian countries,
Australia, and other multilateral agencies. [Pledges were received
from Japan ($4 billion), Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and
Singapore ($1 billion each), Indonesia, Korea, and Brunei ($0.5
billion each), the World Bank ($1.5 billion), and Asian Development
Bank ($1.2 billion).]
As part of the improved public disclosure of key economic
information envisaged under the IMF program, Bank of Thailand (BOT)
Governor Chaiyawat announced that the bank's foreign exchange
obligations arising from forward contracts over the next 12 months
amounted to $23.4 billion. On September 15, the BOT stated that
reserves stood at $25.9 billion as of August 29.
The Thai government has not developed a clear strategy for
restructuring the 58 suspended finance companies. Restrictions have
been placed on foreign ownership. Suspended finance companies are
continuing to operate and the period for determining the disposition
of these companies has been lengthened. Debate in Parliamen- over a
new constitution is also standing in the way of progress on
financial sector reform.

IV-28
Progress toward adjustment in other ASEAN countries has been
mixed. In the Philippines, the central bank appears to be adhering
more closely to its stated intent of letting the peso seek its value
freely by refraining from direct intervention. In Malaysia, the
Prime Minister has made several pronouncements that have whipsawed
the financial markets. The government also announced measures to
keep current account deficits in check by tightening its fiscal
policy through the postponement of infrastructure projects and by
imposing some restrictions on capital goods imports. In Indonesia,
the government has announced steps to restructure the banking sector
by promoting mergers or acquisitions of ailing banks with healthy
ones, and promising to liquidate banks where needed. Other
announced measures included limits on forward contracts with foreign
counterparties, taxes on some imported goods, and elimination of the
limit on foreign acquisition of shares for future initial public
offerings.
The financial markets of many ASEAN members have remained
volatile. From July 1 to September 23, the exchange rates of ASEAN
members have depreciated against the dollar by a little over 5 per-
cent in Singapore, over 50 percent in Thailand, about 20 percent in
Indonesia and Malaysia, and over 25 percent in the Philippines.
These depreciations have occurred despite substantial increases in
overnight interest rates and the imposition of capital controls,
although in Malaysia and the Philippines, interest rates appear to
be back to their July 1 levels.
The health of the financial sector in Korea continues to be a
source of concern. On September 5, the Bank of Korea (BOK) decided
to provide $1.1 billion in special loans to Korea First Bank--the
second-largest of six major city banks--and a similar amount to
financially troubled merchant banks to ease their liquidity
problems. The BOK also announced on September 5 that foreign
exchange reserves fell to $31.1 billion at the end of August from
$33.7 billion in July. The slide in reserves is reportedly due to
BOK's provision of foreign currency-denominated loans to domestic
financial institutions to ease the difficulties they have been
facing in borrowing overseas.
There has been some pressure on the Korean won in the wake of
the currency crises in ASEAN countries and the bankruptcy of the

IV-29
conglomerates. The won depreciated by nearly 2-1/2 percent between
July 1 and September 23 and has moved down over 8 percent since the
start of the year. The stock market has declined by about 8 percent
since July 1. Overnight interest rates stood at nearly 13-1/2
percent on September 23, about 200 basis points above their July 1
level, whereas the yield on three-year corporate bonds, a benchmark
long-term interest rate, has edged up by about 75 basis points.

Korea's trade deficit in July was $0.3 billion, compared with
$1.8 billion in the same month last year; the current account
deficit was $1 billion, compared with $2.3 billion a year ago.
Industrial production grew by about 8 percent from year-earlier
levels. Inflation remained moderate in August.
In Taiwan, second-quarter real GDP registered a sizeable
increase over its year-earlier level, but the staff estimates that
growth at a seasonally adjusted annual rate was only 4.2 percent in
the second quarter, the slowest rate since 1991. This weakness
appears to reflect in part the temporary effects of bad weather and
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in hogs. Strong import growth
contributed to a narrowing of Taiwan's trade surplus in the first
eight months of 1997, compared with the comparable period last year.
Exports rose 5 percent over this period, while imports rose 10
percent. Foreign-exchange reserves fell about $1 billion in July
from June, though they are still up about $1 billion from the
beginning of 1997.

In China,growth remained steady, inflation continued to
moderate, and the trade surplus continued to grow in the first eight
months of 1997. During this period, surging exports led to a trade
surplus of $25 billion, compared with a surplus of $5 billion in the
year-earlier period. The value of exports rose 24 percent while the
value of imports rose 2 percent from the year-earlier period.
International reserves have risen steadily. In July 1997, reserves
reached $128 billion, up $21 billion for the year.

Mexico's economy continued to show strength in the second
quarter, with both real GDP and industrial production rising to well
above their year-earlier levels. The increase in second-quarter GDP
was led by exports and fixed investment, as in prior quarters, but
the rate of recovery of private consumption picked up as well. To a
certain extent, the second-quarter data overstate the improvement in
economic activity, as there were more working days than usual in the
second quarter of this year because Easter Week fell early.
However, the underlying movement in the economy remains positive, as
evidenced by the continued high growth of industrial production in
July, the fall in the unemployment rate over the past few months,
and the sustained rapid expansion of imports. The trade deficit was

IV-31
$18 million in July. This marks the first time since January 1995
that the trade balance moved into deficit and reflects the real
appreciation of the peso as well as rising domestic spending. The
current account deficit expanded strongly in the second quarter as
well. Monthly consumer price inflation remained just below 1
percent for the fourth consecutive month in August, reflecting both
seasonal factors and the continued stability of the peso.
On September 22 the Bank of Mexico announced that, in a
departure from recent policy, when conditions were appropriate, it
would provide sufficient liquidity to the money market to move the
reserve accounts of commercial banks with the Bank of Mexico into
surplus. The move was prompted by concerns that a uniformly tight
monetary policy might keep interest rates excessively high at times,
thereby encouraging capital inflows, a real appreciation of the
peso, and a widening of external imbalances. The Bank indicated
that it would not necessarily loosen monetary conditions
immediately, but that it would do so in the event that interest
rates became inconsistent with the exchange rate, that inflation
fell more quickly than anticipated, that the exchange rate
appreciated unsustainably, or that interest rates increased due to
disorderly money market conditions.

In Argentina, growth in economic activity continues to be
strong. Led by investment, real GDP in the second quarter
registered another substantial year-over-year gain, dispelling some
earlier anticipation that the pace of growth might slow somewhat.

IV-32
Despite high growth, inflation was very low, and the 12-month
inflation rate remained under 1 percent. The expansion has led to
strong growth in imports, especially those of capital goods. With
exports cooling off, the trade deficit through July this year has
widened by roughly $1.6 billion, compared with the same period last
year.

The two leading opposition parties have formed an alliance and
are likely to provide a strong challenge to the Peronists in
upcoming congressional elections in October. The opposition is
focusing on voter concerns about unemployment and corruption,
creating pressures for the government to ease fiscal austerity just
before the elections.
The long-awaited Brady debt buyback by Argentina occurred in
September. The Argentine government issued $2.25 billion worth of a
30-year global bond at a spread of 305 basis points over comparable
U.S. Treasuries and retired $3 billion of Brady debt. The net
present value savings were $242 million.
In Brazil, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 13.9 percent in
the second quarter, after declining in the first quarter. Growth
was led by strong performance in the agricultural and industrial
sectors. Weak consumer demand in recent weeks and apparently unsold
inventories put downward pressures on prices. The CPI was nearly
unchanged in August and the 12-month inflation rate was 4.3 percent,
the lowest in 40 years.

The currency turmoil in Southeast Asia has renewed concerns
about Brazil's external balance. The cumulative trade deficit
through August stood at nearly $6 billion, compared with a deficit
of $5.5 billion for 1996 as a whole, and the real exchange rate is
roughly 25 percent higher than it was three years ago. Concern
about the Brazilian outlook has contributed to the 20 percent fall
in the Bovespa stock price index since early July. Over a three-day
period in late August, the central bank intervened to counter
downward pressures on the real. High domestic interest rates have
also helped defend the real, but short-term rates have fallen
slightly in recent weeks; the rate on one-month CDs was recently
20.5 percent, down from 22 percent in early August. Despite
pressures against the real, on balance, international reserves have
risen from $60 billion at the end of July to $62 billion at the end
of August. Net capital flows have been boosted by foreign purchases
of recently privatized firms.
The government has also responded to concerns about the
possibility of a devaluation by issuing more dollar-indexed bonds.
Issuing dollar-indexed bonds serves as a signal of the government's
determination not to devalue by making it more costly should it do
so. Dollar-indexed bonds have been issued regularly by the
Treasury, and since early 1997, the central bank has issued these
also. The stock of dollar-indexed debt has risen from about $6
billion at the end of 1995 to an estimated $19 billion in mid-
September 1997. Recently, the maturity of these bonds has
predominantly been two to three years. The latest issue on

IV-34
September 17 is a two-year bond, which was priced at about 430 basis
points above comparable U.S. Treasuries.
In Venezuela, there is evidence of a pick-up in economic
activity. While estimates of GDP growth differ, according to the
central bank, whose data are considered the most accurate, the
economy grew by 4 percent in the first half of this year, with the
non-oil sector growing by 2 percent and the oil sector growing by
roughly 9 percent. As expected, inflation has picked up, with the
August increase reflecting the highest monthly rise in consumer
prices since October 1996. The increase in economic activity has
widened the non-oil trade deficit considerably, but strong oil
exports have kept the cumulative trade surplus high.

In September, Venezuela issued some $4 billion of 30-year
global bonds at a spread of 325 basis points over comparable U.S.
Treasuries. The issue was in connection with a debt swap and
Venezuela retired $4.4 billion in Brady bonds, with net present
value savings estimated at $385 million.
In Russia, recent data continue to present a relatively
favorable picture. After years of decline, output appears to be
increasing slightly this year. Official figures show real GDP in
August up slightly from its year-earlier level, and industrial
production showed an even stronger gain. In August, the 12-month CPI
inflation rate remained unchanged at slightly below 15 percent. The
ruble-dollar exchange rate has remained well within the corridor set
by the central bank.
The pace of privatization has accelerated recently, and the
competitiveness of these transactions has increased. The sale of a

IV-35
minority share in Svyazinvest, the Russian telecommunications
conglomerate, to the highest bidder represented an important break
with earlier, less transparent share transfers. Plans have been
announced to accelerate privatization further next year with the
goal of privatizing 37 firms, including oil companies Rosneft and
Lukoil, as well as the oil pipeline company, Transneft.
On September 17, Russia signed an agreement to join the Paris
Club of creditor countries, and also indicated that it plans to
close a debt-rescheduling deal with its commercial creditors soon.
