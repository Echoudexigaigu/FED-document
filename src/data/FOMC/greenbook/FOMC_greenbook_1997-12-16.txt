Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing).

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Labor market indicators point to continued strong growth of
economic activity in recent months. Households evidently have
maintained their upbeat attitudes through the recent storms in world
equity markets, and growth in real consumer spending remained
healthy through November; household confidence has been evident in
the market for homes as well. Trends in capital goods orders have
remained quite positive, but growth in real fixed investment this
quarter appears unlikely to approach the extraordinary pace of the
previous six months. Although labor markets continue to be tight
and to exert upward pressure on wages, sizable gains in productivity
have thus far kept unit labor costs in check. Price inflation has
remained low and stable.
Labor Market Developments
Hiring was very brisk in the first two months of the fourth
quarter. Payroll employment rose about 350,000 on average over
October and November--well above the average monthly pace of the
first three quarters of the year. With labor force particpation
relatively flat over the second half of the year, the recent surge
in employment has caused the unemployment rate to fall to
4.6 percent, its lowest level in almost twenty-five years.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers shot up
1.1 percent in November, as the average workweek jumped more than a
quarter of an hour to a high 34.8 hours. Even assuming some
dropback in December, the increase in hours for the fourth quarter
as a whole would be close to 4 percent at an annual rate.
Private payroll employment rose 409,000 in November after
recording a gain of 257,000 in October. For November, payroll
increases were widespread across sectors. The service industry
accounted for 180,000 of the gain, with temporary help supply
contributing almost a third of that increase. Despite anecdotal
reports that retailers were having difficulty hiring, that industry
posted its largest employment gain in nearly three years.
Employment in the manufacturing sector increased 44,000 in November;
over the past twelve months, manufacturing payrolls have expanded
nearly 200,000.
The November household survey painted a similar picture of
labor market strength. Employment jumped 671,000 after a period of
relatively weak growth. In contrast to anectotal reports that firms

were hiring an unusually large number of part-time workers for the
holiday season, part-time employment, for both noneconomic and
economic reasons, actually fell in November. The longer-term
decline in part-time employment for economic reasons is consistent
with reports that firms are increasingly switching workers from
part- to full-time employment.
The labor force participation rate rebounded in November to
67.1 percent--in line with the average over the first three quarters
of the year. The fraction of the population not in the labor force
but wanting jobs has fluctuated at a low level in recent months,
which continues to suggest that the participation rate has little
upside potential. Indeed, anecdotal reports indicate severe
shortages of workers in some fields--perhaps most notably,
information technology. The problem of availability is reported to
be particularly troublesome for small business; the proportion of
companies reporting to the National Federation of Independent
Business that positions are hard to fill has been at a high level in
the past several months.
Other indicators reinforce the image of a strong labor market
in the fourth quarter. Initial claims for unemployment insurance
stayed low into early December. The Manpower, Inc., survey of net
hiring strength for the first quarter of next year remained at a
high level.1 Household perceptions of labor market conditions
also continue to be very positive, according to the Michigan and
Conference Board surveys.
Growth in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose
4.1 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. Over the four
quarters ending in 1997:Q3, nonfarm business productivity advanced
2.4 percent, the highest rate recorded in almost five years. Third-
quarter gains in labor productivity were particularly large in the
manufacturing sector, in which productivity jumped 9.3 percent at an
annual rate, and in the nonfinancial corporate sector, in which
productivity climbed 6.7 percent at an annual rate.
The sharp rise in nonfarm business productivity in the third
quarter was partly due to an especially large drop in the hours of
the self-employed and of unpaid family workers. The drop in such
hours significantly reduced the measure of all person-hours used by
1. The Manpower survey tends to be a better indicator of current-
quarter changes in payrolls than of developments in the next
quarter, to which it nominally relates.

BLS to calculate output per hour.2 Because hours for the self-
employed and for unpaid family workers are so erratic, a
productivity measure constructed using employee hours may provide a
better signal of underlying productivity growth. By this measure,
output per hour rose 2.3 percent at an annual rate in the third
quarter. Although this figure is smaller than the standard BLS
measure using the hours of all persons, it still represents a solid
gain in productivity relative to its longer-run trend.
The hours of the self-employed and of unpaid family workers
leapt 1.2 percent in November after falling 0.7 percent in October.
Unless hours in this category surge in December, the net effect on
the growth of total hours in the fourth quarter still will be
somewhat negative, although much less so than last quarter. If
hours in this category were to move back up further over the next
few quarters, that rise would tend to damp the pace of productivity
growth measured using the hours of all persons.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a
33.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Over the past
four quarters, compensation per hour grew 3.8 percent; this marks a
1 percentage point acceleration in hourly compensation over the past
two years. However, the pickup in productivity growth has held unit
labor costs in check; for the four quarters ended with 1997:Q3, unit
labor costs grew only 1.3 percent.
Average hourly earnings provide the first reading of labor
costs this quarter. In October and November, earnings rose
0.4 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. Over the past twelve
months, average hourly earnings rose 4.3 percent, up from the
3.6 percent increase recorded over the previous twelve-month period.
The jump in average hourly earnings in November may be exaggerated
somewhat owing to some potential reporting problems the BLS has
identified that tend to lead to relatively large increases in hourly
earnings in months with fewer working days and small increases in
2. In the nonfarm business sector, the hours of the self-employed
and of unpaid family workers fell 14 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter.
3. Compensation per hour is calculated using data on employee
hours and, therefore, is not affected by swings in the growth of
self-employed hours.

4months with more. That aside, the remaining acceleration looks
to be not only a response to the jump in the minimum wage on
September 1, but also some bidding up of wages in a tight labor
market.
Industrial Production
Production worker hours and available physical product data
suggest that industrial production rose sharply in November. A
substantial increase in motor vehicle assemblies and related
activity was one important component of November's advance.
Production of information processing equipment and semiconductors
appears again to have contributed significantly to the overall IP
gain, whereas utilities output appears to have fallen following two
strong months of growth.
Motor vehicle assemblies rose 5 percent in November; both auto
and truck assemblies increased, together contributing about
0.1 percentage point to the rise in industrial production.
Schedules for December call for production to drop to 12.2 million
units at an annual rate.
Manufacturing production worker hours excluding motor vehicles
and parts (FRB seasonals) rose 0.8 percent in November. Adding
normal productivity gains and incorporating the available physical
product data, output in manufacturing outside of the motor vehicles
and parts sector likely soared in November. The increase in hours
was widespread across industries; particularly notable were
increases in industrial machinery and equipment, electrical
equipment (including semiconductors), and food. Among industries
4. BLS has indicated that both the change in the workweek and
average hourly earnings were biased upward in November by what are
believed to be longstanding (although only recently discovered)
difficulties in estimating weekly hours and payrolls for some
establishments that pay their employees on a semimonthly or monthly
basis. In particular, analysts there have identified a negative
correlation between the number of working days in a month (which can
range from 20 to 23 days) and the levels of average hourly earnings
and the workweek. They are currently examining the microdata to
ascertain the exact cause of this problem, but they currently
suspect two likely sources of bias: (1) a tendency by some
establishments to report the same number of hours regardless of the
number of working days in the month; and (2) difficulties in
distinguishing employees paid on an hourly basis from salaried
nonsupervisory employees (who are treated differently in the
processing of the monthly data). Because October had 23 working
days and November had 20, we estimate that the correlation uncovered
by the BLS caused the change in average hourly earnings to be
overstated by roughly 0.3 percentage point. Because December has
23 working days, the change in average hourly earnings is likely to
be depressed by a similar amount.

Production worker hours in the commercial aircraft industry
(FRB seasonals) rose 2.4 percent in November, rebounding from
October's 0.6 percent decline. October's falloff coincided with
Boeing's shutdown of segments of the 747 production line because of
parts shortages and other production difficulties. In November, the
747 line was brought back up, but the 737 production line was
interrupted, also largely because of parts shortages. Both lines
were up in early December, and Boeing plans to increase its assembly
rate through the second quarter of next year.
Indicators of future production continue to point to a
deceleration in IP in the months ahead: One important contibutor
will be the scheduled slowdown in motor vehicle production. The
staff's estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders fell
2.2 percent in October, but this decrease followed a very strong
third quarter; on balance, the recent orders picture points to
moderate growth in the near term. Both the National Association of
Purchasing Managers and the Dun and Bradstreet Manufacturing Survey
indexes of new orders are off a bit from earlier highs, but they
remain at favorable levels.
The staff recently published the annual revison of industrial
production and capacity utilization. The revision incorporated
information from the 1995 Annual Survey of Manufactures and the 1996
Survey of Plant Capacity, as well as updated monthly source data and
new information on prices. The cumulative revision places the level

previously published level for the third quarter. The largest
upward revisions to growth were in 1994 and 1995. The index,
nevertheless, continues to show some slowing in growth in the first
half of 1995 after a surge in 1994. Growth still accelerates in
1996 and 1997, even though upward revisions averaged only about
1/4 percentage point in those years. The largest components of the
upward revision came in the semiconductor and communications
equipment industries, but output elsewhere, especially other durable
manufacturing, was boosted as well.
Capacity utilization in manufacturing in the third quarter of
this year was revised to 81.6 percent, 1-1/2 percentage points less
than previously reported. The revised production indexes and
information from the 1996 Survey of Plant Capacity, which provided
industry utilization rates for the fourth quarters of 1995 and 1996,
implied that manufacturing capacity growth was stronger than
previously estimated. The revised annual rate of capacity growth in
manufacturing exceeds 5 percent since 1995. Although a substantial
portion of the upward revision in capacity growth occurred in the
computer industry, the upward revision was not limited to high-
technology industries.
With the revision, the utilization rate in manufacturing since
1995 has been at, or a bit below, its long-term average. Even more
than the earlier figures, the revised ones show that an acceleration
in the growth of capacity in recent years has accommodated this
lengthy expansion without substantial pressures on manufacturers'
productive capability.
Personal Income and Consumption
Total nominal retail sales turned up 0.2 percent in November,
according to Census's advance report. Spending in the retail
control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and at
building material and supply stores, rose 0.3 percent last month;
however, the similar-sized gains previously reported for September
and October were cut in half. Nominal sales at apparel and at
furniture and appliance stores turned up sharply in November, but
sales at general merchandisers were little changed. This report,
together with available information on prices, suggests that real
PCE for goods excluding motor vehicles in October and November was
about 0.2 percent higher than the average level in 1997:Q3 (not at
an annual rate).

Real spending on services rose 0.6 percent in October, the
latest month for which data are available. Expenditures on energy
services jumped 2.2 percent in October (on a seasonally adjusted
basis), as temperatures returned to normal after a relatively warm
September. According to national weather data, temperatures in
November ran a bit below normal, pointing to another rise in energy
spending last month. Outlays for non-energy services increased
0.5 percent in October, boosted by a surge in expenditures on
brokerage services and solid gains in spending in other categories.
Trading volumes on major U.S. exchanges--an indicator used by the
BEA when constructing its monthly estimates of PCE for brokerage
services--dropped back in November, making a decline in spending on
brokerage services that month highly likely.
Estimates of personal income are available only through
October. In that month, real disposable personal income rose
0.3 percent, boosted by a hefty gain in private wage and salary
disbursements. Aggregate hours worked and average hourly earnings
(even after adjusting for reporting problems) made substantial gains
in November, suggesting that private wage and salary disbursements
will show another large increase for the month.
Readings of consumer sentiment for November continued to show
that households have euphoric views of economic conditions. The
Michigan index rose to a historical high in November, while the
Conference Board index climbed back to the upper end of the very
favorable range that has prevailed since last May. In both the
Michigan and Conference Board surveys, respondents' views of current
conditions improved in November, while appraisals of expected
conditions held steady. On balance, the strong economic outlook as
seen from Main Street seemed to be unaffected by the recent
turbulence on Wall Street and in financial markets abroad: In last
month's Michigan survey, respondents reported more favorable views
of their personal financial situations and of buying conditions for
large household items, and in the Conference Board survey,
respondents' appraisals of current job availability and current
business conditions strengthened further last month.
Motor Vehicles
Adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, sales of new light
motor vehicles rose to 15.1 million units (annual rate) in November,
more than retracing the dip in sales in October. Sales at the Big
Three rose 500,000 units, accounting for nearly all of the increase.

The improvement appears to have been the result of increased
deliveries to consumers; confidential company data from both GM and
Ford indicate that their fleet sales declined last month. A source
at GM also reported that delays in rail deliveries were no longer a
factor holding down sales in November.
Several factors are working to sustain healthy sales of motor
vehicles to consumers. In November, attitudes regarding car-buying
conditions remained in the middle of the favorable range seen over
the past year, according to the Michigan SRC survey. The November
reading on buying plans from the Conference Board ticked down but is
still at a level consistent with a solid sales pace. In part, these
opinions have been bolstered by the competitive pricing among major
producers. Sales incentives are still sizable and are expected to
remain high over the near term. Despite solid sales, Toyota has put
in place modest incentives to ensure that the Camry does not lose
its number 1 sales position to the new Honda Accord.
Housing Markets
The housing sector has remained strong in the fourth quarter.
Housing starts rose to 1.53 million units (annual rate) in October,
as a sharp rise in multifamily construction outweighed a decline in
single-family starts.
Although starts of single-family units fell back after having
reached a high level in September, the October pace of 1.14 million
units was equal to the third-quarter average. Adjusted permit
issuance for single-family units strengthened in October to a level
that suggests that the starts figure may understate the pace of
construction activity.
The fundamentals of demand for single-family housing have shown
continued strength in recent months: Gains in employment and income
have remained sizable, and mortgage rates have declined further.
Although sales of new homes slipped a bit in October, they remained
high, and homebuilders' ratings of new home sales remained quite
positive through early November. Existing home sales, which
(because they are recorded predominantly at the closing rather than
at the signing of the contract) respond to changing market
conditions somewhat less rapidly than new home sales, rose in
October to another high for the series. The SRC index of consumer
attitudes toward homebuying conditions, when adjusted for seasonal
variation, increased in November to the most favorable reading in
three and one-half years. Applications for mortgages to finance

home purchases have risen to the highest point in the eight-year
history of the series.
Multifamily housing starts soared in October to 386,000 units,
which is the highest monthly estimate in nearly eight years.
However, permit issuance for multifamily structures was little
changed, raising doubts about the sustainability of this high level
of starts. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units in the
third quarter was below its year-earlier level for the fourth
consecutive quarter, indicating that the vacant stock is diminishing
slowly even though, at 9.2 percent, it remains relatively high.
Business Fixed Investment
Growth of real business fixed investment appears to be
moderating from the torrid pace registered in the second and third
quarters. Nonetheless, investment fundamentals appear to be strong:
Business output growth has been robust, corporate cash flow is
healthy, and the real user cost-of-capital--especially for computing
equipment--remains low.
Nominal shipments of office and computing equipment fell
1.8 percent in October but remained at a high level. With prices of
personal computers continuing to fall rapidly, real spending on
office and computing equipment ought to post a solid gain in the
fourth quarter. Notably, Intel recently announced a restructuring
of its microprocessor business to better enable it to reduce costs
and match the prices charged by its competitors. The lukewarm
acceptance in the marketplace of the top-of-the-line Pentium II chip
also makes price reductions likely.
Shipments of communications equipment edged up in October after
posting strong gains in the third quarter. This sector has grown
rapidly this year, as Internet usage and telecommunications
deregulation have led to the expansion of local phone networks.
Moreover, price declines are expected this quarter, pointing to a
healthy gain in real outlays.
In contrast to the high-tech sector, expenditures on
transportation equipment appear likely to be a drag on producers'
durable equipment in the fourth quarter. Real domestic spending on
aircraft is likely to fall in the fourth quarter because of
production disruptions at Boeing. Business demand for heavy trucks
was exceptionally robust in October, when sales surged to 454,000
units (annual rate)--noticeably above the strong third-quarter
pace--and sales in November remained close to that high level.

However, with fleet sales of light motor vehicles in October and
November below their third-quarter rate, overall business spending
on vehicles is likely to decline this quarter.
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and
high-tech equipment fell 1.6 percent in October, but they continue
to run well ahead of shipments. Shipments in this category fell
0.9 percent in October. Much of the drop was driven by a sharp
decline in shipments of railroad equipment, which tend to be highly
erratic. Excluding railroad equipment, shipments in this category
fell 0.2 percent.
Spending on nonresidential structures is on track to end the
year lower than it started, despite some strong fundamentals.
Commercial real estate prices, as indicated by the National Real
Estate Price Index, have continued to move up this year, while
vacancy rates have fallen because of robust demand for space. The
FDIC real estate survey of senior examiners and asset managers also
reports a very upbeat assessment of the strength of the commercial
market. Nonetheless, private nonresidential construction put-in-
place fell 1.1 percent in October after having declined 0.5 percent
in September. These data, coupled with information on construction
contracts, point to a decrease in outlays on structures in the
current quarter.
Business Inventories
On a book-value basis, manufacturers' inventories increased at
a $24 billion annual rate in October, a touch faster than the
average rate for the third quarter. With shipments declining
0.1 percent, the inventory-shipments ratio for all manufacturing
ticked up to 1.35 months, the same as its average value for the
third quarter.
Inventories of durable goods increased at a $10 billion annual
rate in October, boosted by another large increase in stocks of
aircraft and parts, which were up $6 billion (annual rate). The
inventory-shipments ratio for aircraft and parts rose sharply, to
4.7, an increase most likely associated with Boeing's recent
difficulties in completing aircraft. Inventories of nondurable
goods increased at a $14 billion annual rate in October, driven by
another large buildup in inventories of chemicals, which expanded at
a $7 billion annual rate. Shipments of nondurable goods advanced
0.8 percent in October, keeping the inventory-sales ratio flat at
1.12 months.

In wholesale trade, stocks continued to build up at a moderate
pace in October. Excluding motor vehicles, wholesale inventories
increased $21 billion (annual rate) in October, about $7 billion
more than the average rate for the third quarter. A surge in the
accumulation of stocks of farm products ($14 billion, annual rate)
accounted for much of the overall rise. This stockbuilding most
likely was the result of the timing of this year's harvest, which,
at the end of October, had moved ahead at an unusually rapid pace.
Changes in wholesale stocks of farm products in the coming months
are likely to be much smaller. With sales flat in October, the
inventory-sales ratio for wholesale trade excluding motor vehicles
ticked up to 1.24 months, extending its upward trend.
In retail trade, stocks of non-auto inventories increased
$29 billion (annual rate) in book-value terms in September,
reversing August's large decline. The inventory buildup was most
notable in nondurable goods, which grew $17 billion (annual rate),
the largest increase since July of last year.
Federal Government
The October Monthly Treasury Statement reported continued
shrinkage in the unified deficit. Adjusted for payment timing
shifts, and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction
proceeds, the October deficit fell $12 billion from last year's
level. Adjusted outlays increased only 2-1/2 percent, while
receipts rose 15 percent. Withheld individual income taxes and
withheld social insurance taxes (FICA), which accounted for
80 percent of total receipts in October, were up 11 percent from a
year ago.
The Congress and the President have approved all thirteen
regular appropriations bills funding discretionary government
programs in fiscal year 1998. According to CBO, new budget
authority for these programs in fiscal 1998 will increase
$24 billion (5 percent) from the fiscal 1997 level. Relative to
CBO's September estimates for discretionary outlays in fiscal 1997,
outlays in fiscal 1998 are projected to rise only $6 billion
(1 percent) because some of the increase in new budget authority--
notably that for defense procurement and subsidized housing--will be
spent in later years. CBO estimates that defense and nondefense
discretionary outlays in fiscal 1998 will be about equal to the
discretionary outlay caps legislated in the Budget Enforcement Act

of 1997. Meeting the spending caps in future fiscal years will be
increasingly difficult because the caps increase less than
$4 billion in 1999 and in 2000 and then stay about flat in 2001 and
2002.
State and Local Governments
Spending by state and local governments in the first part of
the fourth quarter apparently was fairly subdued. Employment edged
down 2,000 in November following an upward-revised increase of
21,000 the month before. These figures are well below the average
monthly advance of 28,000 over the first nine months of the year.
Real construction spending rose 0.6 percent in October, to a level
slightly below the third-quarter average; much of the strength was
in construction of educational facilities, while building of
highways and water supply systems declined.
Prices
The incoming news on price inflation has remained favorable.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in October, the same rate
of increase recorded in each of the past three months. Over the
past twelve months, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent, down
from a 3.0 percent increase over the year-earlier period. The
favorable labor cost environment, weak import prices, declining
inflation expectations, and modest energy price increases have all
contributed to this deceleration in the CPI.
The CPI for energy was little changed in October after having
risen 3 percent over the preceding two months. Retail gasoline
prices edged off in October after having risen sharply earlier
partly because of a strong end-of-summer driving season. Natural
gas prices rose 2.4 percent in October after a similar increase in
September as demand was pushed up by higher prices for some
substitute fuels and rail supply disruptions forced some electric
utilities to substitute gas for coal. Over the past twelve months,
energy prices have risen only 0.9 percent, down considerably from
the 5-3/4 percent increase in the year-earlier period.
Retail food prices rose 0.2 percent in October, close to their
average rate of increase over the past few months. The CPI for food
away from home was up just 0.1 percent in October; although wages at
eating and drinking establishments jumped in September with the rise
in the minimum wage, the pass-through of higher wage costs into food
prices has thus far been only modest. Overall, the CPI for food was
up 1.8 percent over the twelve months ended in October, more than

2 percentage points less than the increase over the preceding twelve
months. Although recent data on farm commodity prices suggest that
retail food prices could blip up in the very near term, the
increases appear likely to be concentrated in categories--such as
eggs and fresh vegetables--in which price spurts typically are
short-lived.
For items other than food and energy, consumer prices rose
0.2 percent in October, continuing a string of small increases. On
a twelve-month-change basis, the core CPI was up 2.3 percent in
October, down 1/4 percentage point from the pace registered a year
earlier.5 Prices of both goods and services other than food and
energy registered some deceleration over the past year. Among
goods, falling import prices have been an important restraining
influence on prices in recent years. This restraint has been most
clearly evident in the prices of new motor vehicles, which declined
slightly over the twelve months ended in October after having risen
more than 2 percent over the preceding year. (The deceleration in
new and used auto prices accounts for most of the 1/4 percentage
point deceleration in the core CPI over the last year.) The pace of
price increases of many other goods also was lower over the past
year; apparel was one notable exception, having picked up about
2 percentage points. Among services other than energy, price
increases slowed for many items, including medical care and auto
finance charges.
Broad expenditure price measures other than the CPI also slowed
over the past year. Core PCE prices continued to decelerate over
the past year, about in line with the core CPI over the past two
years. Among product prices, the pace of increase in the GDP chain
price measure has moved down about 1/2 percentage point over the
past four quarters.
Inflation expectations as measured by the Michigan SRC index
have also come down over the past year, although they ticked back up
a bit in November. In the third quarter of this year, one-year-
ahead median expectations were about 1/4 percentage point lower than
a year earlier, while mean expectations were about 3/4 percentage
point lower. And ten-year-ahead mean inflation expectations of
professional forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia were down 0.3 percentage point from a year ago.
5. The deceleration is about the same magnitude after adjusting
for technical changes in the CPI.

The PPI for capital equipment edged down in October and stood
about unchanged from its year-earlier level, compared with an
increase of 0.7 percent over the previous twelve months. In
October, the capital goods index was held down by a drop in truck
prices. However, computer prices reportedly were unchanged in
October after having fallen on average nearly 2 percent per month so
far this year.
Prices at earlier stages of processing have also been
restrained lately. The PPI for core intermediate materials only
edged up in October, and the index for core crude materials
rebounded only partially from a decline in September.
In addition, price indexes for industrial commodities have
plummeted since the time of the last Greenbook. The Journal of
Commerce industrial price index, in which price changes are
"standardized" to take account of historical volatility, has dropped
about 5 percent since early November, and the CRB price index for
spot industrials has fallen about 6-1/2 percent. Declines over this
period have been widespread among metals, textiles, and other
industrial inputs such as hides and rubber. Prices of food
commodities--and the indexes in which these commodities are given
large weight--also are down on balance since early November, but by
a much smaller amount than the industrial price measures.
6. The October reading reflected big price increases for larger
computers: prices of personal computers fell at close to their
average rate so far this year.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The decision by the FOMC to keep the federal funds rate at
5-1/2 percent at its November meeting was widely expected and
elicited little market response. In the weeks that followed,
spreading strains in Asia solidified the sentiment that additional
policy restraint would not be needed to contain inflation, and, with
economic data suggesting that domestic considerations would not
otherwise force policymakers' hands, most interest rates moved
lower. In recent days, though, surprising strength in the November
employment report raised the question as to whether System action
might not be needed at some point, causing market interest rates to
roll back some of their earlier declines. On net, over the
intermeeting period, most interest rates have shown rather narrow,
mixed changes, and spreads of private over Treasury rates have held
steady. The exception to that pattern is one-month rates, which
bumped much higher when that maturity crossed the year-end. Futures
rates currently price in about 1 to 2 percentage points of year-end
pressures in the federal funds market; these pressures about match
the average expectations before year-end of the past five years
(chart).
Major equity indexes have gained 4 percent to 6 percent over
the intermeeting period, reversing much of the price declines of
late October. The notable exception has been the NASDAQ composite,
which has been held down by the recent poor performance of
technology stocks. Over the year to date, equity indexes have risen
about 20 percent to 30 percent. The modest outflow from equity
mutual funds in late October proved transitory; households have
resumed fairly healthy net purchases of such funds. The main
exception has been international funds, which have become less
attractive to investors.
Indicators of market skittishness have receded from the spikes
of late October. Volatility inferred from option prices on both
bonds and equities has dropped to levels prevailing before the
market correction. Although risk spreads on fixed-income
instruments have retraced only part of their late-October runup, the
spreads remain on the narrow side, judging by historical ranges.
With markets remaining quite receptive, bond issuance by
nonfinancial businesses has picked up recently after slowing in
November; equity issuance by nonfinancial companies has remained

fairly robust, although the price performance of new stock offerings
has been considerably less exuberant than it was earlier this year.
Borrowing by households appears to have strengthened in October, and
recent indicators of household credit quality point to a leveling
out of debt strains in this sector. Treasury borrowing has remained
light, forcing further cuts in auction sizes. Growth of the broader
monetary aggregates turned up in November, boosted by currency
demands and a turnaround in liquid deposits.
Business Finance
Despite the decline in bond yields in November, gross corporate
bond issuance fell off sharply last month (table and chart). The
investment-grade sector, which in recent quarters has been issuing
debt primarily to fund mergers and acquisitions, accounts for the
bulk of the decline. For firms of investment-grade status, mergers
and takeovers involving cash payments are typically funded first
with commercial paper, which is rolled over until later replaced by
a bond offering. In November, a number of large mergers were
financed with commercial paper, but the rumored bond issues were
either postponed or trimmed in size.
Speculative-grade bond issuance stayed at a fairly high level
in November and early December. Although interest rate spreads
increased from their record-low levels of October, they remain
subdued by historical standards. In addition, corporate credit
quality appears to be solid. Business failures in October and
November dropped significantly from already low rates posted earlier
in the year, and the default rate on junk bonds has remained very
low.
Recent swings in stock prices left little imprint on public
equity issuance, as offerings by nonfinancial companies remained
high in November (table and chart). The volume of IPOs hit
$3.3 billion in November, the largest monthly volume this year.
However, the price performance of these deals deteriorated
noticeably. Most of the issues were completed with offering prices
below the filing price range, and first-day price increases for IPOs
averaged a mere 6-1/2 percent, down from 22 percent in October. In
addition, more than 80 percent of seasoned offerings in November
fell in price. Meanwhile, equity retirements have remained very
heavy. Companies continue to announce stock repurchase plans at a
near-record pace, and ongoing merger activity will result in about
$25 billion of equity retirements in the fourth quarter.

Equity prices rebounded over the intermeeting period, and the
NYSE and S&P 500 indexes topped their peak October levels before
dropping back in recent days. Earnings disappointments and downward
revisions to projected earnings picked up some of late, but mostly
they have been concentrated in the technology sector in which
exposures to Asian problems also have raised concerns. Reflecting
the heavy weighting of technology stocks, the NASDAQ index remains
about 8-1/2 percent below its October peak (chart, upper panel).
Overall expectations of earnings growth, however, remain
surprisingly upbeat. The consensus of Wall Street strategists' 1998
profit projections implies 7 percent growth in S&P 500 earnings next
year, little different from the view of two months ago. In
addition, longer-term (five-year) growth projections for the S&P
500, constructed from I/B/E/S surveys of company analysts, remain at
the record-high levels of September (chart, middle left panel).
To be sure, this optimism is fueled by continued exceptional
corporate performance. As with earnings per share for the S&P 500,
growth in NIPA book profits rebounded in the third quarter (chart,
middle right panel). On a seasonally adjusted basis, third-quarter
NIPA profits were up roughly 2-3/4 percent from the second quarter
and 10-1/2 percent from a year earlier. However, price-earnings
ratios are at all-time highs (chart, lower panel) and, given the
late stage of the current expansion, suggest extraordinary optimism
about corporate prospects.
Mutual Funds
Mutual fund investors' enthusiasm for equities cooled off
somewhat after the market correction of late October. Equity funds
posted a net outflow in the last week of that month. According to
preliminary estimates, inflows recovered in November but at only
half the pace of the prior two months (table). Concerns about Asian
and Latin American markets generated a rare monthly net outflow from
international funds. Net inflows to domestic growth funds dropped
from the high levels posted in the third quarter. To some extent,
the stock market's gyrations heightened investors' interest in bond
funds, which are more stable. As a result of this substitution, the
net inflow to bond funds picked up well above its third-quarter
pace.
Liquidity ratios at equity funds remain around 5 percent, a low
level by historical standards although they proved adequate to meet
limited investor withdrawals when they have occurred in recent weeks

(chart). Many mutual funds reportedly have secured committed lines
of credit from banks and other backup sources to supplement
liquidity in the event of heavy withdrawals.
Banking
The share prices of money center banks were hard-hit by the
financial market turmoil of late October and November but have since
about caught up with the S&P 500. Evidently, market participants
came to the realization that, in the aggregate, banks' exposure to
Asia was not sizable enough to affect the health of the industry
significantly. Country exposure reports through June indicate that
money center banks had about $38 billion of loans to Japan and
$27 billion to other troubled countries in Asia; for the banking
system as a whole, that aggregate exposure represents a small
proportion of banks' capital. Nonetheless, a number of money center
banks have reported negative effects on fourth-quarter earnings as a
result of unsettled conditions in global markets.
Data from the September Call Report indicate that loan
delinquency rates at banks held steady or even improved a bit
(chart). However, in the most recent survey of senior Federal
Reserve bank examiners, a third of the respondents indicated that
they believed that loan portfolio quality had deteriorated in the
third quarter, owing to problems with credit card loans. About
a quarter of the examiners had reported some deterioration in the
second quarter.
Household Sector
Consumer credit grew 10-1/2 percent at an annual rate in
October, as all three major components accelerated from the prior
month (table). Smoothing through monthly swings, consumer debt
seems to be expanding at about the same rate as personal income.
Data on mortgage borrowing in the fourth quarter are scarce: Growth
in real estate loans at commercial banks slowed in October to about
half the third-quarter pace but appears to have picked up in
November. Meanwhile, the MBA indexes of applications for purchase
and refinance remain quite high, suggesting healthy mortgage
borrowing.
Following the recent flattening of the yield curve, the spread
between the initial rate on fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and that on
adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) has fallen to a near-record low
level of 165 basis points (chart). The relative attractiveness of
FRMs has been reflected in a declining share of ARM originations, to

only about 18 percent of the total conventional mortgage
originations and a lowering of the ARM share of outstandings to less
than 25 percent. Interest rates on FRMs have followed the decline
in Treasury rates, to 7.15 percent most recently, the lowest level
in almost two years and about 40 basis points above their cyclical
lows in 1993.
Government Finance
The federal deficit is expected to rise in the fourth quarter,
reflecting the typical seasonal pattern. The Treasury will finance
most of the fourth-quarter deficit by borrowing from the public,
although it is also expected to reduce its cash balance by a
significant amount. In light of the continued small deficit, the
Treasury has reduced auction sizes further, cutting the three-month
and six-month bill auctions each by $250 million in mid-November.
Part of the financing in the bill sector has taken the form of a
$21 billion cash management bill that will mature after the mid-
January tax receipts.
Spreading financial strains in Asia have heightened concerns in
the market that foreign holders may be forced to sell some of their
Treasury securities in large volume to bolster income statements by
realizing profits and to fund repayment of dollar or home currency
liabilities. Foreign official dollar reserves have recently leveled
off, and the Federal Reserve's custody holdings for foreign central
banks have declined about $25 billion from their April peak. (These
custody holdings include securities financed through official
currency interventions in the foreign exchange market.) However,
any drop in demand from these sources seems at least to have been
offset by the redirection of funds by other investors toward the
safety and liquidity provided by Treasury securities as well as by
perceptions of restraint on demand and prices in the United States.
Spreads between noncallable, agency-issued securities and
Treasuries have remained stable over the intermeeting period.
Unlike earlier in the year, no global bond was issued, probably
because the GSEs were reluctant to tap foreign financial markets at
a time of turmoil abroad. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation recently guaranteed an issue of so-called CRA mortgage
bonds, which are based on loans to low- and moderate-income
homeowners. Purchasing such bonds will help banks satisfy
requirements arising from the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act.
Besides the implicit government guarantee, the lower repayment risk

of such loans--since lower-income borrowers have fewer refinancing
options--makes the CRA bonds attractive.
Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities dropped about
$2 billion, to $16.7 billion in November, owing to a continued fall-
off in refundings from their fast third-quarter pace. Yields on
long-term tax exempts declined some (table), though by much less
than yields on Treasuries of similar maturities (chart), and the
ratio of municipal yields to taxable yields rose further.
Monetary and Credit Aggregates
The monetary aggregates grew briskly in November: M2 and M3
expanded at annual rates of 7 percent and 11 percent respectively,
putting M2 just above, and M3 well above, their annual ranges.
Rather than extending its trend decline, Ml grew near an 8 percent
annual rate last month, reflecting the unusually rapid expansion of
currency and demand deposits. Some of this increase in currency was
attributable to shipments to Russia. Demand deposits also surged,
boosted by a slight, probably temporary slowdown in the introduction
of new sweeps and a pickup in mortgage refinancing induced by the
decline in longer-term rates last month. (Funds used to prepay
existing mortgages are sometimes temporarily held in escrow in these
accounts.)
M2 growth provided a boost to M3, which was amplified by a
substitution of managed liabilities in M3 for other sources of
funds. The growth of large time deposits ticked up to a
12-1/2 percent pace in November, while RPs almost doubled at an
annual rate. Banks apparently had more assets to fund last month,
judging by the expansion of bank credit.
Bank credit, adjusted for the effects of mark-to-market
accounting rules, grew at an annual rate of 11-1/2 percent in
November, a rapid pace in line with that of the previous two months
and well above that of earlier in 1997. In particular, commercial
banks significantly expanded their securities portfolio in November,
which contributed to the growth of bank credit and probably boosted
the growth of RPs. This expansion in the securities portfolio
mainly occurred at large domestic and foreign banks and was apparent
in both government and other securities.
Business loan growth slowed from a 10 percent rate in October
to a 5-1/4 percent pace in November, even though banks remain
vigorous in their pursuit of C&I loans: In the third-quarter bank
examiner survey, for instance, respondents by a wide margin

identified that category as the one in which terms and standards had
been eased the most. The most recent survey of bank lending terms
indicates that spreads on business loans edged lower in the fourth
quarter (chart). According to the survey, spreads are a bit higher
than one year ago for loans greater than $1,000,000, probably
reflecting a shift toward riskier loans; spreads on smaller loans
are lower on net.
Despite strains in Japan, credit extended by Japanese branches
and agencies has remained about flat of late. While real estate
loans at those entities have continued to run off, their business
lending has picked up the slack.

APPENDIX
REVIEW OF DEBT AND MONEY IN 1997
Summary
Growth of the total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors
slowed in 1997, but that of M2 and M3 picked up. The decline in the
growth of total debt reflected a sharply reduced expansion of
federal debt owing to the smaller fiscal deficit. Nonfederal debt
grew at the same rate as last year, as a deceleration of household
debt matched a slight acceleration of business debt and a more
noticeable pickup in state and local debt. Strong growth in
depository credit--particularly bank credit--contributed to rapid
expansion in M3. With opportunity costs little changed, M2 expanded
at roughly the same rate as nominal GDP.
Domestic Nonfinancial Debt
Domestic nonfinancial debt advanced at a 4-1/2 percent rate
through October, notably slower than nominal GDP but near the middle
of its monitoring range. Federal debt grew less than 1 percent this
year, down from 3-3/4 percent last year. The fiscal 1997 deficit
was below that of any year since 1974. Nonfederal debt grew at a
5-3/4 percent rate.
Household Finance. After slowing by nearly half in 1996,
growth in consumer credit edged down further this year. This
moderation occurred despite a pickup in consumer outlays and likely
reflected a more cautious attitude toward credit use by households,
substitution of home mortgage borrowing for consumer credit, and a
more restrictive posture by bank lenders toward some borrowers. The
delinquency rate on banks' consumer loans seems to have plateaued
this year, albeit at a high level, but the charge-off rate rose to
new highs, and personal bankruptcies continued to increase rapidly
through the first half of the year before stabilizing in the third
quarter.
In contrast, substitutions of real estate loans for consumer
loans and robust growth in residential structures bolstered total
home mortgage growth, although the pace was a bit lower than last
year. At banks, home equity lending expanded at a double-digit pace
as banks reportedly encouraged customers to use this source of funds
to consolidate their credit card debt. More dramatically, other
lenders, particularly finance companies, have been aggressively
offering mortgages with loan-to-value ratios of 100 percent or more
as a means of consolidating other debt. The home equity and nonbank
mortgage market were undergirded by a strong appetite by investors
for securities collateralized by these loans. Delinquency and
charge-off rates on home mortgage loans, including home equity
loans, remained low.
Business Finance. Business debt expanded at a fairly rapid
6 percent rate this year, up a bit from last year. A surge in
capital outlays outpaced a hefty advance in internal funds, and
merger-related equity retirements remained brisk. With this year's
appreciable business borrowing, the deleveraging of nonfinancial
corporations' balance sheets that has been going on since the early
1990s has about stopped. Measures of the financial condition of the
business sector, on balance, were favorable. Upgrades of corporate
III-A-1

III-A-2
debt about matched downgrades, and bond defaults. C&I delinquency
rates, and charge-off rates all remained low; in contrast, business
bankruptcies rose somewhat, albeit from a low level. Credit markets
continued to be quite receptive to new debt offerings, as corporate
bond spreads stayed near historical lows, widening only modestly
during the financial turbulence this fall. Banks also continued to
be willing lenders, reporting further reductions in spreads of loan
rates over benchmark rates. The gross issuance of bonds by
nonfinancial corporations through November was more than a third
higher than in 1996; junk bonds accounted for an unusually large
part of the increase. Gross issuance of equity also was strong, but
net issuance remained deeply negative because of merger-related
retirements and a large volume of stock buybacks by corporations.
Commercial mortgages grew moderately for the second consecutive
year, as prices and activity in commercial building continued to
strengthen. Banks were the largest source of funds for these loans.
Another significant source of funds was commercial-mortgage-backed
securities, and their popularity likely held down real estate loan
growth at banks. Indeed, increases this year, through September, in
securities backed by all types of income property mortgages,
including multifamily, nearly equaled increases in the outstanding
amount of these loans on banks' books.
State and Local Finance. State and local debt expanded a
little more than 5 percent in 1997. after leveling out last year
following two years of declines. Municipal debt outstanding had
been held down in recent years by the retirement of bonds that were
advanced refunded in the early 1990s, but this factor has become
much less pronounced because advance-refunded debt was largely
worked down by the end of 1996.
Depository credit
Credit extended by depository institutions expanded at a
6-1/4 percent pace through November, up appreciably from last year.
Bank credit accelerated to an 8-1/4 percent pace, owing in part to
the acquisition of thrifts by banks. The increase in bank credit
was the fastest in ten years, and banks' share of domestic
nonfinancial debt outstanding climbed to its highest level since
1988. Bank credit accelerated in part because banks accumulated
securities--which had run off in 1995 and had been flat in 1996--at
a brisk pace in 1997. Loans also advanced a bit more quickly this
year than last, though more slowly than in 1995.
The solid growth in bank loans occurred despite a net decline
in consumer loans that owed to sharply slower growth in loans
originated by banks and continued robust securitizations. Real
estate loans at banks, by contrast, have grown at nearly twice the
pace posted in 1996. This category of credit has benefited from the
rapid growth in home equity lines, the turnaround in commercial real
estate lending, an acceleration in home mortgages, and thrift
acquisitions.
C&I loan expansion was strong this year, partly because of the
factors boosting business borrowing in general but also because
banks increased their share of the business credit market. Mergers
and acquisitions picked up among middle-market firms, which are more
likely than large corporations to use bank financing. In addition,
banks continued to compete vigorously for business loans, narrowing
spreads and easing other terms. To date, however, Senior Loan

III-A-3
Officer Surveys have found little evidence that banks are easing
standards on these loans, and C&I loan charge-off and delinquency
rates remain extremely low.
Continued high profitability and abundance of capital
facilitated an aggressive position by banks. Certainly, some banks
faced credit quality problems on their consumer loans, which led to
consolidation of a few credit card lenders. But overall delinquency
and charge-off rates stayed quite low, and banks' return on equity
remained in the elevated range it has occupied for several years.
Like banks, thrifts are profitable and well capitalized, and
they also were actively pursuing borrowers in 1997. The slowing in
thrift credit growth reflected the acquisition of thrifts by
commercial banks: Among thrifts not acquired during the year,
assets grew roughly 8 percent.
Monetary aggregates
Boosted in part by the solid growth in depository credit. M3
shot up this year, expanding 8-1/2 percent through November, well
above its 2 to 6 percent annual range. M3 was augmented by a
funding shift, concentrated at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks, from borrowings from related offices abroad, which are not
included in M3, to large time deposits issued in the United States,
which are. Another factor contributing to the strength in M3 was
the increasing inroads made by institution-only money fund., in
corporate cash management.
While not matching the strong pace of M3, M2 grew at a healthy
5-1/4 percent rate through November, a touch above its 1 to
5 percent annual range. Even though the opportunity cost of holding
M2 was about unchanged over the year. M2 appears to have grown a
little more slowly than nominal GDP, continuing the upward drift in
velocity that has occurred for the past few years. The ongoing
adoption of sweep programs by banks again resulted in considerable
growth in the savings and MMDAs component of M2 at the expense of
transactions accounts. The initiation of programs that sweep funds
out of NOW accounts appears to be slowing, but retail demand deposit
sweeps have picked up, leaving the total amount by which sweep
account balances increased similar to last year. Inflows to M2
money funds picked up toward year-end, probably in response to the
turbulence in the stock market. Indeed, inflows into bond and stock
mutual funds did slow a bit in November, but 1997 could well be a
record year for these funds. Currency growth was strong, boosting
M2 expansion. Shipments of currency abroad, while still elevated,
were off a bit from the extraordinary levels seen in recent years,
but the effects of strong domestic spending were more than
offsetting.

Exports of goods and services in the third quarter were only
marginally higher than those in the second quarter. Increased
exports of machinery, industrial supplies, and higher service
receipts (half from foreign travelers in the United States and half
from other private services) were nearly offset by sharp drops in
exports of aircraft and gold. By region, increases in shipments to
Mexico and other Latin American countries were more than offset by
small declines in exports to most other areas (including Japan and
other countries in Asia).
Imports of goods and services in the third quarter were 1-1/2
percent higher compared with the second quarter. There were
increases in most major trade categories; the exceptions were
imports of gold and petroleum products.
Oil Imports and Prices
The quantity of imported oil increased again in the third
quarter relative to the second quarter, marking two consecutive
quarters of strong increases in oil imports. These relatively high
import levels were driven by extremely robust consumption in the

second and third quarters--up more than three percent from rates
observed a year ago. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics
indicate that oil imports remained strong in October due to
continued high consumption demand.
The price of imported oil rose 5 percent in October after
declining 1/2 percent in September. Tensions in the Middle East--
that led to a buildup of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and a
perceived threat to oil supplies from the region--contributed to the
jump in October prices. On balance, import prices have moved
relatively little since April of this year.
The spot price for WTI rose $1.47 per barrel in October, aver-
aging $21.26 per barrel and reflecting increased tensions in the
Middle East. Prices declined $1.09 per barrel in November, when the
United States field commander explained that U.S. forces had no
intention of engaging in armed conflict with Iran and dropped
further when the Persian Gulf coalition partners announced that
force would be used against Iraq as a last resort. Prices have been
pushed even lower in December in reaction to OPEC's announcement of
a nearly 10 percent increase in its production quota. Spot WTI is
currently trading below $19 per barrel for the first time since
January 1996.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Non-oil import prices continued their downward trend in
October-November, but at a somewhat faster rate than in the third
quarter. Most of the declines were in foods, computers, semi-
conductors, and other capital goods. In contrast, prices of
imported automotive products rose.
Export prices decreased moderately in October-November. The
declines were primarily attributable to lower prices for agri-
cultural products, other industrial supplies, and capital goods.
Increased prices were recorded for exports of automotive products
and consumer goods.
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit widened $17.2 billion (SAAR)
in the third quarter. A larger deficit for net goods and services
accounted for most of the change from second to third quarters.
Only small changes were recorded for investment income and
transfers.

The balance on goods and services weakened $16 billion (SAAR)
in the third quarter. Exports of goods and services rose only
marginally following three quarters of strong growth. Imports
increased 1-1/2 percent with the rise spread over most trade
categories.
For investment income in the third quarter, there was a small
decline in net direct investment income receipts (payments rose more
than receipts rose) that was largely offset by a small strengthening
in net portfolio income payments (private receipts from abroad rose
more than U.S. income payments to foreigners rose).
U.S. International Financial Transactions
The fallout from the turmoil in Asian financial markets is
apparent in the data on U.S. international transactions in October.
Reflecting a flight to quality, private foreigners bought net more
than $30 billion in U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a on the Summary
of U.S. International Transactions table). As usual, the bulk of
these sales was to the United Kingdom, with the identity of the
ultimate purchaser unknown. However, it was also reported that
residents of Japan, Mexico, and Hong Kong made large direct net
purchases. In addition, private foreigners purchased net over $7
billion in U.S. government agency bonds (included in line 4b);
Japanese residents accounted for about $4.5 billion of this total.
Foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate stocks (line 4c) declined
from the August and September pace, but remained relatively strong
despite the market dip. Increases in foreign holdings of U.S.
currency also have picked up in recent months (line 8).
U.S. net purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) dropped sharply
in October, while net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b)
recovered somewhat. Net purchases of securities in Europe more than
accounted for the total.
Banks in the United States continued to report net outflows in
October (line 3). The reported outflow was more than accounted for
by transactions between U.S. branches of foreign banks and their
parents. These outflows appear to reflect in part borrowing in the
United States through RP transactions by a Japanese financial
institution. Countering these outflows slightly, liabilities of
Mexico have been increasing in recent months.

Foreign official assets in the United States (line 1) declined
in October. In Asia, holdings of China and Hong Kong increased, but
holdings of Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, and Malaysia declined. In
Latin America there were substantial declines in holdings of Brazil
and Mexico. Preliminary data from FRBNY indicate a sharp decline in
Russian holdings in November.
Data recently released by the Department of Commerce indicate
that foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7) slipped
somewhat in the third quarter from the very strong pace of the first
half. U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) also slipped from
the very high second-quarter level: the large intercompany outflows
to finance company affiliates in the United Kingdom in the second
quarter were reversed in part in the third quarter. Both inflows
and outflows of direct investment continue to be swelled by numerous
mergers and acquisitions.

Commerce Department data also indicate that the Eurodollar
deposits of U.S. nonbanks continued to increase in the third
quarter(line 5 on the International Banking Data Table). Credit
extended to U.S. nonbanks from banks outside the United States also
grew in the third quarter (line 4). Overall, recorded credits in
the U.S. international transactions accounts continued to exceed
recorded debits, resulting in a very large negative statistical
discrepancy.
Foreign Exchange and International Asset Markets
Since the November FOMC meeting, the dollar has strengthened 4
percent against the yen. The weakness of the yen vis-A-vis the
dollar is generally attributed to concerns over financial fragility,
the slow pace of economic activity, monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan, and competitive pressures from other Asian economies.
Japanese long-term bond yields have remained close to their
historically low levels. The rise of the Japanese 3-month rate by
24 basis points reflects the emergence of a "Japan premium," an
increased funding cost of Japanese banks, caused by heightened
credit quality concerns as well as by end-of-year "window-dressing"
efforts by non-Japanese banks to reduce their reported exposure to
Japanese banks. Japanese share prices rose 2-1/2 percent on balance
during the intermeeting period while undergoing sharp fluctuations,
reflecting ongoing uncertainty over the manner in which the
government will commit public funds to support the banking system.
The Korean won, which had begun to depreciate earlier in the
fall, accelerated its decline
Immediately
following the announcement of the IMF-led stabilization package the
won gained 5 percent against the dollar, but depreciated rapidly
thereafter on market concerns that the IMF package, even if
implemented as announced, will fail to restore market confidence; on
balance, the won depreciated 42 percent against the dollar through
December 11. Korean share prices fell 28 percent over the same time
period.
The currencies of the other East Asian emerging economies--
the main exceptions being China and Hong Kong--also depreciated

against the dollar.
The Thai baht declined further after the
debt ratings of several Thai financial institutions were downgraded;
on balance, the baht declined 13 percent. The Malaysian ringgit
fell 12 percent, while the Philippine peso fell 6-1/2 percent. The
Singapore dollar and Taiwan dollar participated to a lesser degree
in the waves of depreciations; these two currencies declined 2-1/2
and 3-3/4 percent against the dollar, respectively.
Equity prices in most East Asian emerging economies continued
to decline on reports of mounting economic difficulties. Thailand's
stock market fell 24 percent in the intermeeting period, and
Indonesian share prices fell 14 percent. Malaysia's stock market,
which fell sharply earlier in the intermeeting period, reacted
positively to new, austere budget measures proposed by the
government in late November, rising 12 percent on balance since
December 1. The Philippine stock market rose 1-1/4 percent on
balance.
The dollar strengthened 3-1/2 percent against the mark. The
mark's depreciation occurred amid data releases that indicate that
German inflation continues to be benign and output growth moderate.
In addition, statements by Bundesbank officials that they see no
immediate need to raise interest rates to contain inflation and
comments by several European central bank officials that European-
wide interest rates will converge closer to the low end of the
current spectrum of European interest rates also weighed on the
mark. German and French bond yields fell about 30 basis points
during the intermeeting period; corresponding short-term interest
rates were largely unchanged. Italian short-term rates fell 56
basis points and long-term rates fell 44 basis points, reflecting
the continued movement of Italian rates towards German and French
rates. The Swedish central bank announced on December 11 that it
would raise its repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent; the
Riksbank stated that this policy measure was taken in order to help
meet its 1998 inflation targets.

IV-13
The U.S. dollar strengthened 1-1/4 percent against the
Canadian dollar. The Canadian currency's weakness was attributed
by some market analysts to falling commodity prices following the
sharp decline of Asian growth. The Bank of Canada raised its Bank
Rate by 25 basis points on November 25 to offset the stimulative
effect of the depreciating Canadian dollar. The Canadian long-term
bond yield increased by 19 basis points and the Canadian 3-month
interest rate rose by 30 basis points, in step with the increase in
the overnight policy rate set by the Bank of Canada. The dollar
strengthened 2 percent against sterling, supported by a narrowing of
the spread between U.K. and U.S. long-term interest rates.
Share prices in the industrialized countries, with the excep-
tion of Canada, are up since the November FOMC meeting and have
recovered most of the losses sustained in late October and early
November. Equity prices in Germany and the United Kingdom rose 7
and 5 percent, respectively, during the intermeeting period. The
comparative weakness of the Canadian stock market, which fell
almost 2 percent on balance, is being attributed to the effects of
declining world market prices of primary commodities and gold on the
profitability of a large number of Canadian companies.
The exchange value of the Mexican peso, which had fallen
sharply against the dollar in late October and early November, has
risen 3/4 percent since the last FOMC meeting. The peso's rebound
may be attributed to rising market confidence in the ability of
Mexico to weather the financial crises originating in Asia. Yield
spreads on Latin American Brady bonds, which had increased in
October, fell by 140 and 210 basis points in the intermeeting
period. The stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina rose
between 5 and 10 percent.
The Czech koruna fell 6 percent against the dollar on the
fallout of a political scandal and the subsequent resignation of the
entire Czech cabinet towards the end of November. The Russian ruble
fell 3/4 percent vis-à-vis the dollar.
The price of gold has declined 8 percent since the November
FOMC to $284 per fine ounce, as markets perceived a continued trend
towards a lower demand for monetary gold by the world's central
banks.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Real GDP growth in the foreign G-7 countries averaged about 4
percent on an export-weighted basis in the third quarter, and
preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued
above-trend growth in most countries. The pace of expansion remains
particularly robust in Canada and the United Kingdom, fueled largely
by strong domestic demand growth. Both the German and French
economies also continued to expand at healthy rates in the third
quarter. However, Italian growth has slowed in the second half of
the year, while the Japanese economy has rebounded only modestly
following last April's consumption tax increase. The impact of the
crisis in southeast Asia, which is expected to be much more severe
in Japan than in the other countries, has not yet become fully
apparent in current indicators.
Unemployment generally remains high, and year-over-year
consumer price inflation is currently below 2 percent in Canada and
the major continental European countries. Although the consumption
tax increase and some other temporary factors have recently pushed
measured inflation in Japan to around 2 percent, the underlying rate
remains low there as well. In contrast, recent evidence suggests
that inflationary pressure is continuing to build in the United
Kingdom as labor markets tighten.
Individual country notes. In Japan, third-quarter GDP
expanded at a 3.1 percent rate, registering only a modest rebound
from the second quarter's double-digit decline. Private consumption
retraced about a third of its second-quarter drop, led by an
increase in new car sales. Private non-residential investment grew
at a 6 rate, offsetting a second-quarter decline of identical
magnitude. Residential investment, however, plunged by 36 percent,
reaching its lowest level since the first quarter of 1987.
Government consumption and public investment jointly contributed
3/4 of a percentage point to growth, partially reversing declines
registered in recent quarters. Net exports made a negative

IV-15
contribution to growth as exports fell a bit from their very high
second-quarter levels.

1. Annual changes are Q4/Q4.
Economic indicators for the fourth quarter suggest a
continuation of the economy's lackluster performance. Industrial
production during October and new car registrations during October
and November were essentially unchanged from their third-quarter
levels, and labor market conditions appear to be deteriorating.
Inflation, net of the effect of the tax increase, remains virtually
nonexistent.
Import volumes in October increased slightly from third-
quarter levels, but the volume of exports was up by 10 percent.
However, the October data provided the first glimpse of the effects
of the Asia crisis on Japanese trade, with exports to Thailand
declining 20 percent from their year-earlier level. In addition,
foreign orders for machinery fell sharply in October.
In mid-November, the Japanese government released a package of
120 economic stimulus measures, including proposals for further
deregulation, plans to improve the liquidity of the real estate
market and the efficiency of land use, and measures designed to
stimulate private investment. However, the government's package

In recent weeks, two large Japanese financial institutions
have failed. On November 17, the Japanese authorities announced the
closure of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank (HTB), one of the twenty-five
largest Japanese banks with assets of ¥9 trillion (about $72
billion). The majority of HTB's operations will be assumed by
Hokuyo Bank, a second-tier regional bank in Hokkaido. All of HTB's
depositors will be protected, but its management will be forced to
resign. On November 24, Yamaichi Securities, Japan's fourth-largest
brokerage house, reported that it was voluntarily suspending
operations. Yamaichi announced that its capital base, which was
previously reported as ¥431 billion (about $3.4 billion) at end-
September 1997, was being revised downward by ¥265 billion (about
$2.1 billion), reflecting the acknowledgement of unrealized losses
and a variety of other off-balance-sheet debt. The Bank of Japan
has provided liquidity to both Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi
Securities, as well as to the market as a whole, in an effort to
minimize disruptions as these institutions conclude their business
operations.

Real GDP in Germany rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter. The external sector continued to provide the primary
impetus to growth, as exports rose at a double-digit rate for the
second consecutive quarter. In contrast, private consumption
declined sharply, retreating to its first-quarter level. Although
the growth in total investment was modest, spending on machinery and
equipment was up sharply. Inventory accumulation was sizable, but
inventory figures are a residual in the national accounts and are
subject to substantial revision.

Early indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that the
economic expansion continued. Industrial production rose sharply in
October following the declines registered in August and September.
Manufacturing orders fell in October for a second consecutive month
but remain at a high level following rapid gains over the two
preceding quarters. The October decline was due primarily to a
sharp drop in orders from foreign firms, while domestic orders
showed a strong gain. Business confidence also dropped back a
little in October but remains high. However, conditions in the
labor market are still stagnant, with the all-German unemployment
rate remaining at 11.8 percent in November. CPI inflation has

In France, third-quarter real GDP increased at a 3.7 percent
annual rate, following a 4.5 percent rate increase in the second
quarter. Domestic demand growth more than accounted for the robust
third-quarter expansion, as the contribution from net exports turned
negative. Consumption growth picked up sharply from its sluggish
pace earlier in the year, and investment growth increased as well,
contrary to expectations. Given the imprecise nature of initial
investment estimates and the variable consumption performance, it is
still early to tell whether the economic expansion has become more
broadly-based. Increased investment over the past two quarters,
however, is consistent with recent strength in capital goods
production, which business surveys and balance of trade data had
earlier suggested were primarily export-oriented.
The limited information available so far for the fourth
quarter suggests that economic activity is continuing to expand,
although probably at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter.

two months of declines to a level slightly above the third-quarter
average, partly reflecting increased back-to-school allowances.
However, business surveys in October-November continue to highlight
strong foreign orders (which have not been affected to date by the
crisis in emerging-Asia), and do not indicate a further acceleration
in domestic demand. Also, investment expectations for 1997 have
been revised down. The unemployment rate has remained at an
historically high level of 12.5 percent all year, and inflation
pressures remained subdued.

Preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that
growth remains strong. The average volume of retail sales surged in
October, more than offsetting a decline in September. Spending in
September had been depressed by a number of special factors,
including unusually low sales in the week leading up to the funeral
of Princess Diana. Although business sentiment weakened somewhat in
November, the Purchasing Managers Survey of manufacturers indicated
that new domestic orders rose sharply, while export orders increased
moderately.
Conditions in the labor market have continued to tighten. The
official claimant unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.2 percent in
October, but surveys suggest that skill shortages and recruitment
difficulties have increased. Growth of nominal earnings remains
moderate. Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose

IV-21
2.8 percent over the year to November, remaining above the govern-
ment's inflation target of 2 1/2 percent for underlying inflation.
Producer input prices continued to decline in November, reflecting
the strength of sterling.

In its November Inflation Report, the Bank of England noted
that both output growth and inflation have turned out to be about Yz
percentage point higher than in the central projection made for the
August Report, reflecting a surprisingly muted effect of sterling's
appreciation on net trade, while the impact of the higher exchange
rate on the domestic price level has been restrained by rising
profit margins. For the first time, the Inflation Report gave the
Bank's projection for real GDP growth as well as inflation over the
forecast period. The Bank's central projection is for growth to
fall below 2 percent in 1998, but then to pick up somewhat in 1999.
Inflation is projected to be around the government's target rate of
2% percent. The Monetary Policy Committee decided not to reinstate
the monitoring ranges for the MO and M4 aggregates, which had lapsed
in May when the Bank was granted operational independence, noting
that velocity has behaved erratically recently.
In Italy, GDP rose at a preliminary 1.6 percent rate in the
third quarter. Although actual data on the breakdown of expendi-

IV-22
tures are not yet available, the Italian statistical agency
indicated that final domestic demand growth was strong, with both
household consumption and business investment contributing
positively. Inventory accumulation, which contributed over 6
percentage points to second-quarter growth, slowed in the third
quarter. Preliminary data also indicated that the pass-through
effects of the highly successful auto-tax incentives continued in
the third quarter.
Fourth-quarter indicators are very limited. Consumer
confidence in October and November was slightly below its third-
quarter average, but remained significantly higher than its level in
the second quarter. Business sentiment also declined in October,
reaching its lowest level since June.
Italian inflation remains low. In November, consumer prices
rose 1.6 percent (yr/yr), the same rate registered in the previous
month. Although the pass-through effects of the rise in VAT last
month put upward pressure on consumer prices in November, they were
to a large extent offset by a moderation in food and energy prices.

On November 21, the Senate (the upper house) approved the
government's 1998 budget proposal, which includes a total of $15
billion equivalent (or about 1 1/2 percent of GDP) in deficit cutting

IV-23
measures. Roughly $3 billion of the planned reductions arise from
lower welfare spending. Under Italian law, the budget proposal,
which is currently under consideration in the lower house of the
parliament, is required to be approved by the end of December.
The Canadian economy continues to grow at a robust rate. Real
GDP at factor cost increased at a 4.8 percent rate in the third
quarter, with home-building and wholesale sales of machinery and
equipment showing particular strength. Most of the third-quarter
gain came in July, however, with monthly output growth slowing in
the August-September period. Employment growth resumed in November,
after a pause in September-October. The unemployment rate moved
back down to 9.0 percent in November, reversing an uptick in
October, and would have moved even lower if not for a strong
increase in the labor force. September retail sales and October
housing starts also showed continued strength. Consumer price
inflation slowed a bit in October to 1.5 percent on a twelve-month
basis, showing little evidence of immediate price pressures despite
the strong economy.
Recent data on trade and the current account provide perhaps
the most significant indication of strong Canadian domestic demand.
The current account deficit widened more sharply than expected in
the third quarter, to $4.6 billion, from $2.8 billion in the second
quarter. The increase in the deficit was largely due to a decline
in the surplus on trade in goods, as strong growth in domestic
demand led to a surge in imports, especially of equipment and
machinery. Monthly trade data showed a steady shrinking of the
trade surplus month-by-month during the third quarter, as imports
grew at a rapid clip.
The Bank of Canada increased its key Bank Rate 1/4 percentage
point, to 4 percent, on November 25, the third such increase this
year. The Bank indicated that it was responding to the recent
weakness in the Canadian dollar, related to the impact of the Asian
crisis on the prices of commodities produced intensively in Canada.
As measured by the Bank's monetary conditions index, currency
weakness had reversed all of the monetary tightening put in place
with the rate hike on October 1; the Bank indicated that such an
easing of monetary conditions was not appropriate at this time.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Financial turmoil has shown little signs of abating in the
ASEAN region. In Korea, a major financial crisis has erupted,
prompting the government to seek international financial assistance.
By early December, downward pressures on currencies had abated in
Hong Kong, Brazil, and Argentina, but renewed pressures emerged in
the wake of the deterioration of conditions in Korea.
The financial turmoil in the five major ASEAN countries has
led to a significant slowdown in growth in the region. In contrast,
growth has remained strong in Korea, whose troubles reached crisis
proportions only recently, and in Taiwan and China. Growth
performance was also good in major Latin American countries in the
third quarter. External imbalances in the ASEAN region have
narrowed as a result of the fall in domestic demand and currency
depreciations.
ASEAN and individual country notes. In Korea, a serious
financial crisis has erupted following several months of mounting
concern about the health of Korean banks. Most of Korea's major
banks have heavy exposure to several large industrial conglomerates
that failed earlier in the year. In October and November, increased
concern about bank solvency put the won under strong downward
pressures. By December 2, the won was 25 percent below its level on
October 30. Over that period, the stock market fell by 25 percent
to its lowest level since May 1987, and the yield on 3 year won-
denominated corporate bonds rose over 500 basis points.
On December 3, Korea and the IMF reached agreement on an IMF-
led assistance package that will total roughly $57 billion. The IMF
will provide $21 billion in the form of a three-year standby
arrangement with the first $10 billion to be distributed in three
tranches over a five-week period. This will be supplemented by
$10 billion from the World Bank and $4 billion from the Asian
Development Bank. The United States, Japan, and other major
industrial countries have also agreed to provide over $20 billion
collectively in bilateral assistance. The assistance would be
provided only as a backup to the support from the multilateral
agencies and could only be drawn upon subject to stringent
conditions. The U.S. support would come from the U.S. Treasury's
Exchange Stabilization Fund.

IV-29
The IMF plan requires, first, that Korea rapidly restructure
its troubled banking sector. Weak banks will be merged with
healthier ones, and some insolvent banks will be closed. Second, it
requires a very substantial and nearly immediate opening of the
capital account. Foreign investors will be allowed to purchase a
majority stake in Korean companies and buy Korean bonds without
restriction. Third, Korea must pass legislation that grants
autonomy to the Bank of Korea (BOK) and makes price stability its
primary objective. Fourth, the BOK is required to maintain a tight
monetary policy stance.
Financial markets have been volatile since the announcement of
the program. By December 11, the won was 34 percent below its
December 2 close, while the stock price index was basically
unchanged after a rollercoaster ride. Korea will hold its
presidential election on December 18, but none of the three
candidates has articulated a plan for resolving the current crisis.
Korea's crisis comes against the backdrop of a modest pickup
in Korea's economic growth and improvement in its trade balance.
The trade balance improvement has reflected in part a depreciation
of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar. (The won declined by
about 16 percent between March 1996 and mid-October 1997, prior to
its precipitous drop that began in late October.) Inflation has
remained quite low.

The turmoil in financial markets in the ASEAN region has shown
little sign of abating. Since the last Greenbook, the currencies of
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand have
further depreciated against the dollar and stock indices have
continued to decline. In most countries, interest rates have

IV-30
remained at elevated levels. In Singapore, where interest rate
increases were very modest so far, two of the "Big Four" banks
raised their prime rates last week.
The substantial increases in interest rates since July appear
to be slowing domestic demand growth considerably in the ASEAN
region. Malaysia's real GDP growth in the third quarter was under 4
percent (s.a.a.r), its slowest pace in four years. In the
Philippines, real GDP grew by just over 2 percent (s.a.a.r) in the
third quarter, a sharp slowdown from the pace in the first half of
the year. Singapore, however, posted robust growth in the third
quarter, boosted by strong recovery in global electronics demand.
In Thailand, industrial production contracted sharply in the third
quarter.

Inflation has picked up substantially in some economies in the
region, driven in large part by the substantial depreciations of
their currencies. In Indonesia, inflation rose to 10 percent in
November (year-over-year); a long drought has exacerbated the
inflationary pressure. Inflation has so far remained at low levels
in Malaysia and Singapore.

The response of policymakers to the regional financial crisis
has been mixed. Progress on Indonesia's IMF program--which got off
to a good start with the closure of some banks and with intervention
boosting the rupiah--appears to have stalled. The Philippines is
struggling to complete successfully its IMF program. Thailand and
Malaysia, however, have taken some action to quicken the pace of
financial sector reform. On December 7, Thai authorities announced
the closure of 56 of the 58 suspended finance companies; this action
paved the way for the IMF's release of the second tranche of funds
(about $0.8 billion) under the standby arrangement. On December 5,
Malaysia's government unveiled a stabilization package that includes
a sharp cut in government spending and measures to improve financial
sector disclosure standards and performance. Market reaction to the
measures has been positive as the stock price index rose almost 5
percent from the day of the announcement to December 10.

IV-32
In Hong Kong, speculative pressures on the Hong Kong dollar
had eased by early December, but were renewed upon concerns about
Korea. The yield spread between Hong Kong government debt and U.S.
Treasuries narrowed from 1150 basis points in late October to 350
basis points on December 10 at a one-year maturity, but the
following day widened to 500 basis points. Despite the speculative
pressure on the currency in late October and press reports of heavy
intervention in foreign exchange markets by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, foreign exchange reserves actually rose in October from
the previous month. Reserves stood at $92 billion, up $4 billion
from September. GDP grew 6.4 percent in the second quarter of 1997
(the latest period available) from a year earlier.
In China, output growth has continued to moderate in 1997,
while inflation has remained low. In the first ten months of 1997,
surging exports led to a trade surplus of nearly $36 billion,
compared with a surplus of $8 billion in the year-earlier period.
The value of exports rose 24 percent while the value of imports rose
4 percent from the year-earlier period. Import growth has been
somewhat stronger since mid-year, with imports up 10 percent since
June from the year-earlier period.
So far, China has remained relatively unaffected by the
current financial crisis in Asia. China's exchange rate has
remained stable against the U.S. dollar, while foreign exchange
reserves have risen steadily: through September, foreign exchange
reserves were up $29 billion for the year, reaching a level of $136
billion. China's currency is not convertible on the capital
account, making a speculative attack difficult.

In Taiwan, output has grown strongly in recent months, while
consumer prices have remained relatively flat. Strong import growth
contributed to a narrowing of Taiwan's trade surplus in the first
eleven months of 1997 to $7.8 billion, compared with a surplus of
more than $11 billion in the comparable period last year. Exports
rose 6 percent over this period, while imports rose 12 percent.

As of December 10, the Taiwan dollar had depreciated 12
percent against the U.S. dollar since Taiwan's authorities announced
on October 17 that they would no longer defend the currency. The
stock market, which fell nearly 30 percent from mid-August to late
October, had recovered nearly 20 percent as of December 11. At the
end of October, international reserves were $83 billion, down $3
billion from a month earlier, and down $7 billion from their recent
peak in June.
In Brazil, growth moderated in the third quarter, as real GDP
was up by 4.1 percent (s.a.a.r.), compared with a whopping 14
percent growth in the second quarter. Indications are that economic
activity has slowed since late October, when the central bank raised
its discount rate from 21 to 43 percent. (The rate was subsequently
lowered to 41 percent.) Inflation has continued to be remarkably
low under the Cardoso government's 3-1/2 year-old stabilization
program, the "Plano Real."
Downward pressures on the currency, the "real," have generally
eased in recent weeks. However, at the end of the intermeeting
period, financial conditions had begun to weaken again, apparently
as a result of the turmoil in Korea. Interest rates on 30-day bank
CDs, which skyrocketed from 20 percent in early November to 47

IV-34
percent in mid-November, stood at 35 percent on December 10. The
Bovespa stock price index, which had plunged by 35 percent between
late October and mid-November, had regained over half of its earlier
loss. Central Bank President Gustavo Franco and Finance Minister
Pedro Malan have stated several times in recent weeks that the
government has no intention of devaluing the "real."

The improvement in financial conditions followed the Cardoso
government's unveiling of a package of 50 fiscal measures aimed at
reducing the fiscal deficit by $20 billion in 1998 (2-1/2 percent of
GDP). Prospects for fiscal tightening were strengthened when the
House of Deputies approved a constitutional amendment that would
enable federal, state, and local governments to cut their payrolls.
The government hopes that fiscal austerity will also cut the
current account deficit, which is expected to be about 4 percent of
GDP in 1997 and has fueled downward pressures on the "real." The
cumulative trade deficit for the year through November was
$9 billion, up considerably from a deficit of about $2 billion over
the same period last year. Imports grew 25 percent over the period,
while exports grew 10 percent.
In Argentina, economic activity continues to display strength.
Industrial production rose 13 percent in October from its year-ago
level, and real GDP grew by 8.6 percent in the third quarter from a
year ago. Despite this, inflation remains non-existent. The
stronger output growth has led to a trade deficit of over $2 billion

IV-35
through September this year, compared with a surplus of $1.6 billion
over the same period in 1996.
Since the eruption of the currency crisis in Asia in late
October, Argentine financial markets have experienced considerable
turmoil. In the first few days of the crisis, the Argentine Central
Bank lost about $1 billion in foreign currency (roughly 5 percent of
reserves excluding gold), but reserves recovered in a short time and
stood at just over $19 billion at the end of November, roughly the
same level as at end-September. Total bank deposits from October 19
to November 19 actually grew by 2.5 percent, but peso-denominated
deposits fell 3 percent, indicating a modest shift toward dollar-
denominated deposits. The blue-chip Merval index fell some 30
percent from October 23 to November 12, when it reached a low-point
for the year. Although it subsequently recovered much of its
earlier losses, stock prices were dragged significantly down again
this week by declines in world market.

A major impact on Argentina of developments in Asia since late
October has been high interest rates. The call money rate rose from
6.5 percent in late October to a peak of 13 percent in early
November and since then has fallen to about 9 percent. Over this
period, the peso-dollar deposit spread on 30-day deposits rose from
about 50 basis points to a peak of 700 basis points, and has since
fallen to 300 basis points. Argentine Brady bond spreads have
displayed a similar pattern of movement.

IV-36
After several months of discussions, the Argentine government
has reached agreement on an IMF $2.8 billion Extended Fund Facility.
The program will follow the current stand-by, which will expire at
the end of this year. All performance criteria have been met.
Mexico's economy showed unexpected strength in the third
quarter as real GDP rose 8.1 percent above its year-earlier level,
or about 2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis from the second
quarter (not annual rate). The robust economy was mirrored in an
even stronger showing for industrial production, and continued the
rapid expansion registered earlier in the year. Recently, growth
has become more broadly based. While manufactures, the focus of
recovery after the 1995 recession, have continued to expand, output
in the construction and service sectors also have grown strongly in
the third quarter. Largely reflecting the rebound in domestic
demand, the trade balance continued to deteriorate in recent months,
leading to a correspondent widening of the current account deficit.
However, inflation has remained subdued, with upticks in September.
and November largely reflecting seasonal factors.

Mexican financial markets appear to have stabilized following
the turmoil that was triggered by the sharp decline of the Hong Kong
stock market at the end of October and its spillover into markets in
other regions. The peso value of the dollar, after rising to over
8.4 at the end of October, has since returned to about 8.1 in recent

IV-37
trading, only 5 percent more depreciated than its mid-October level.
At the most recent Treasury auction, 28-day interest r tes
registered 19.3 percent, still about 200 basis points above their
mid-October level, but below their recent peak of 21.2 percent on
November 11. Additionally, spreads on Mexican Brady bonds, adjusted
for collateral, have declined to about 440 basis points from their
recent peak of 600 basis points on November 12.
In Venezuela, the recent pick-up in economic activity
continues. The economy grew by 4 percent in the first half of this
year, and recent data on automobile sales and electricity usage
indicate that this growth is continuing. The upward trend in recent
months in inflation was reversed slightly in November. The growth
in economic activity has led to an increase in imports, and the non-
oil trade deficit has widened to $5 billion through September this
year, compared with $3.6 billion over the same period in 1996.
International reserves (excluding gold) stood at $15 billion at the
end of November, about 25 percent higher than a year ago and roughly
the same as at end-September. As a fallout of the Asian situation,
the Caracas stock index has displayed considerable volatility and on
net has fallen 20 percent since late October.

In Russia, the most recent available macroeconomic indicators
continue little changed. In October, output remained slightly above
its year-earlier level and inflation continued to decline, dropping
below 13 percent on a 12-month basis.
Financial markets have come under substantial pressure over
the past month, reflecting spillover from financial market turmoil

IV-38
in Asia as well as concerns over the course of macroeconomic policy
in Russia. The ruble has come under heavy selling pressure,
According to Central Bank Chairman
Dubinin, total reserves (gold and foreign exchange) declined nearly
$5 billion in November to $18 billion. The existence of restrictions
which prevent some foreign holders of ruble assets from immediately
converting them into foreign currency--imposing a delay of a month--
suggest that the November selling pressure may be reflected in
further reserve losses in December. On November 10, the central
bank moved to support the ruble by raising its main lending rate by
7 percentage points to 28 percent. On December 3, the central bank
indicated that this rate would be adjusted up further, in line with
the rise in market rates. Equity prices, which had risen very
sharply earlier in the year, have fallen by over one-third on
average from their peak levels of October.

Recent political developments have raised questions over the
future course of economic policy. A scandal over a book contract
has led to the dismissal of several key economic reformers from
their government positions, including the loss by First Deputy Prime
Minister Chubais of his position as finance minister. President
Yeltsin has suggested that there may be further personnel changes if
his promise to pay all government wage arrears by the end of the
year is not met. (This goal appears very unlikely, given the large
size of these arrears--about $2 billion--and the continued

IV-39
substantial shortfall of tax receipts.) This apparent disarray in
the government's policymaking apparatus has emboldened the
opposition-controlled parliament to delay consideration of the
government's proposed 1998 budget and key economic reform measures,
including tax reform.
