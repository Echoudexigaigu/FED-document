text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing).

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Supply-side indicators of GDP for the fourth quarter provide
evidence of continued robust growth as employment and industrial
output recorded hefty increases. Spending indicators also point to
above-trend growth, but not nearly so strong as those on the supply
side. Household outlays decelerated and the saving rate ticked up
late last year despite continued high confidence levels. At the
same time, growth in real business fixed investment came to a halt
after its remarkable surge in the second and third quarters. A
tightening of the labor market has caused nominal wages to
accelerate somewhat over the past year, but prices decelerated,
restrained by falling import and energy prices.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter. Growth of
nonfarm payroll employment averaged 358,000 per month--and the
average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers ticked up.
The unemployment rate fell further, to an average of 4.7 percent--
the lowest in more than twenty-five years.
The robust pace of hiring late last year reflected gains across
all major industries. Notably, manufacturing added 125,000 jobs
during the fourth quarter, bringing total growth for the year to
230,000; construction added 88,000 jobs, almost half of its net gain
for the year. Employment in retail trade surged, and despite
anecdotes of hiring difficulties, general merchandise and apparel
outlets added almost 40,000 jobs between September and December, a
much larger gain than in earlier quarters. The strong demand for
retail workers also was reported to have contributed to a pickup in
hiring in the help supply industry, which had shown
uncharacteristically weak performance earlier in the year. The
weakness in help supply had been attributed in part to a lack of
qualified and available workers (perhaps for more technical jobs
than seasonal retailing) rather than slackening demand. Other
service industries also saw significant increases in hiring during
the fourth quarter: Jobs in engineering and management, computer,
and health services all rose faster than their 1997 averages.
Fluctuations in the workweek of private production or
nonsupervisory workers led to a choppy monthly pattern in the growth

of aggregate hours last quarter.1 Smoothing through these
wiggles and including BLS estimates for other wage and salary
employees, hours for all employees rose 4.4 percent (annual rate) in
the fourth quarter. However, because hours of self-employed and
unpaid family workers fell at a 3.2 percent rate, we estimate that
hours of all persons in the nonfarm business sector--the series used
to estimate labor productivity--rose about 3-1/2 percent (annual
rate). Given our expectation for growth of nonfarm business output,
productivity appears to have risen at close to its trend rate of
1-1/4 percent last quarter, after two quarters of rapid increases.
The household survey also portrayed a robust labor market at
year-end. Household employment growth averaged 339,000 per month
last quarter, and the labor force participation rate rose to
67.2 percent in December. Although the overall participation rate
changed little on net over 1997, the participation rate for adult
women moved up 0.3 percentage point during the year. More than half
of this increase came from a further rise in participation among
women maintaining families; about 60 percent of these women have
children under 18, making them an obvious group to be affected by
welfare reform. However, the participation rate for these women has
been rising fairly steadily throughout the current expansion, which
makes it difficult to separate the effect of the recent welfare
reforms from a cyclical response. The fraction of the population
not in the labor force but wanting jobs continued to drop last
quarter, suggesting limited room for further increases in overall
participation rates.
Other indicators also point to a tight labor market. The four-
week moving average of state initial claims for unemployment
insurance, at 329,000, has held at a level consistent with
relatively strong growth of payroll employment. Surveys of
businesses conducted by the National Federation of Independent
Business and the Bureau of National Affairs showed that the
1. The BLS recently confirmed that the workweek data are
sensitive to the number of days in the monthly pay period because of
inconsistent reporting by respondents. This problem artificially
boosts the change in the workweek when moving from months with more
working days to months with fewer (such as from October to November)
and causes a subsequent drop in the workweek when the situation is
reversed (such as between November and December). The BLS has
indicated that the net effect of this bias on the average workweek
in the fourth quarter was probably negligible. The agency has
embarked on a program to identify establishments that have been
reporting incorrectly and expects to publish more consistent data at
the time of its annual benchmark in June.

proportion of companies reporting jobs difficult to fill remained at
very high levels at year-end. In addition, smoothing through the
monthly gyrations, the Michigan SRC and Conference Board surveys of
households continue to point to very favorable perceptions of labor
market conditions early in 1998.
Industrial Production
Total industrial production rose 7-1/2 percent at an annual
rate in the fourth quarter, with manufacturing output soaring
8-1/4 percent, the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of
1994. Production of durable goods continued to advance briskly,
particularly in industries producing motor vehicles and parts,
aircraft and parts, and information technology goods. However,
growth in the production of computing and office equipment slowed to
about a 20 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter from the third-
quarter's blistering 50 percent increase. Output in nondurable
goods production picked up in the fourth quarter after having been
sluggish earlier in the year; the advance was led by gains in food,
printing and publishing, and chemical products.
The operating rate in manufacturing reached 82.5 percent in
December, but was just a bit above its historical average and
1.8 percentage points below its most recent peak in January 1995.
Anecdotal reports suggest few bottlenecks and continued rapid
capacity growth.2
Production of motor vehicles and parts advanced almost
19 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter as automakers made up
output lost to strikes and start-up problems in the third quarter.
Production in December fell from November's high level, and industry
schedules call for a further decrease in motor vehicle assemblies in
the first quarter. At the end of December, the days' supply of
light trucks and autos were at comfortable levels.
2. The most recent semiannual economic forecast from the National
Association of Purchasing Managers, conducted in November and
released early in December, indicated that the proportion of
purchasing executives who expect capital expenditures to rise over
the next year exceeds the proportion who expect capital expenditures
to fall by 20 percentage points. In contrast, the margin was only
6 percentage points in December 1996. We expect to receive
information from NAPM in February as to whether this optimistic
forecast has been tempered by economic developments in Asia.

Days' supply estimates use sales figures adjusted for shifts
in reporting periods.
Several other factors also suggest that growth in industrial
production is likely to moderate in the first quarter. The staff's
estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders was little changed in
the fourth quarter, after having increased 4.4 percent in the third
quarter. In December, the new orders index from the National
Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) fell to its lowest level
in more than a year. In contrast, the monthly new orders index by
Dun and Bradstreet remained more optimistic.3
Signs of slowing export demand have begun to appear. The NAPM
index of new export orders fell in December to its lowest level
since January 1996. Also, anecdotal reports, including the Beige
Book, suggest that some manufacturers are seeing weaker demand from
Asia, although the dimensions of that weakening, to date, remain
unclear. Export demand has been an important contributor to the
strength in output over the past two years; as shown in the
accompanying chart, we estimate that the growth in exports from the
first quarter of 1996 through the third quarter of 1997 contributed
6.2 percentage points to the 12.6 percent rise in durable
manufacturing production over that period.4 Export growth was a
less important source of growth in nondurable manufacturing.
3. Dun and Bradstreet also publishes a quarterly report.
Manufacturers in this survey also lowered their expectations for new
orders in the first quarter of this year relative to the fourth
quarter of 1997; nonetheless, this index also is still at a
relatively optimistic level.
4. Exports figures are converted to an IP basis by deflating
nominal exports by BLS export price indexes, and multiplying the
resulting real export figures by an adjustment factor based on the
ratio of IP to shipments in 1992.

Consumption and Personal Income
Growth in consumer outlays moderated in the fourth quarter
after having surged more than 5-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the
third quarter. Nevertheless, circumstances seem favorable for
sizable spending gains in the near term: Real disposable income
growth has been ample in recent months; consumer sentiment remains
decidedly upbeat; and households have enjoyed a stunning increase in
net worth.
According to the Census Bureau's advance report, total nominal
retail sales increased 0.7 percent in December and 0.2 percent in
the fourth quarter (not at annual rate). Spending in the retail
control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and
building material and supply stores, rose 0.2 percent in December
and 0.4 percent in the quarter as a whole (not at an annual rate).
Nominal outlays at outlets for durable goods within the retail
control category--furniture and appliance stores and stores selling
"other durable goods"--posted strong gains in December, and these
stores recorded strong sales fairly consistently throughout the
fourth quarter. However, at stores selling nondurable goods, sales
edged down in December and were unchanged in the fourth quarter.
The retail sales report suggests that real personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) for goods excluding motor vehicles rose
0.4 percent in December and 1.1 percent at an annual rate in the
fourth quarter. Building in a small anticipated decline in real
motor vehicle purchases, we estimate that real PCE for all goods
likely increased about 3/4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth
quarter.
Real expenditures for services rose 0.6 percent in October and
0.2 percent in November. In November, real outlays for energy
services (natural gas and electricity) were little changed, while
brokerage and investment services were pushed sharply lower by a
drop in trading volume. Looking to December, temperatures were
about average for the month, suggesting only a small rise in energy
services. However, trading volume on major U.S. exchanges rose
about 4 percent, which should boost real outlays for financial
services.
The personal saving rate averaged 3.9 percent over October and
November, after having dropped to 3.5 percent in the third quarter.
5. As described in the motor vehicle section, we expect BEA to
adjust motor vehicle sales for changes in the reporting period.

In November, real disposable income rose a hefty 0.6 percent, led by
a rapid increase in wages and salaries. Although December's labor
market report suggests a much smaller increase in labor income for
that month, earlier strong gains should be enough to generate a
solid increase in real labor income in the fourth quarter. Looking
ahead, a factor that may provide some additional impetus to
consumption growth is the current wave of mortgage refinancing.
However, because prevailing mortgage rates are not so far below
those on the outstanding stock of loans as was the case in the last
wave, the effects on spending could be relatively small.
Consumer sentiment has remained at highly favorable levels.
After having declined in December, the Michigan SRC index of
consumer sentiment rose in early January to the middle of the
reasonably high range that has prevailed since early last year.
Households' appraisals of current conditions were little changed in
January, but appraisals of expected conditions rebounded because of
more positive expectations for their personal finances and future
business conditions.
The SRC reported that one respondent in ten mentioned concern
about Asian economic problems in January and that these households
were more likely to expect the unemployment rate to rise.
Nevertheless, the index of expected unemployment change moved down a
bit in January following a sharp rise in December.
The Conference Board index of consumer confidence fell back in
January after climbing to its highest level since early 1969 in
December. Households in this survey were less upbeat about expected
business conditions, income, and employment: however their
perception that job opportunities are currently abundent kept their
assessment of the present situation extraordinarily positive.
Motor Vehicles
Reported sales of new light vehicles in December jumped
1 million units, to 16.1 million units at an annual rate, in large
part because many automakers extended their reporting period into
early January. Adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, we
estimate that sales increased about 1 percent, to 15.3 million
units. Correcting for reporting-period effects, most of the
increase was the result of a spurt in sales at Toyota, which
reflected the company's successful effort to ensure that Camry would
achieve the title of top-selling car in 1997. At this point, we
expect companies to close their books at the end of this month, and,

with the shortened reporting period for January, reported sales for
the month should fall sharply.
In the past, the extension of the reporting period would boost
BEA's estimate of PCE and PDE spending for motor vehicles and be
mostly offset by a lower estimate of inventories. The effect on GDP
would reflect only the differences between the wholesale and retail
margins. BEA, however, has decided to exclude an estimated effect
of automakers' changes in reporting periods. Thus, the NIPA
estimates for motor vehicle purchases in the fourth quarter should
not be distorted by the extended reporting period.
Overall, sales of light vehicles in 1997 were 15.1 million
units, little changed from the pace seen in the previous several
years. However, this pace was maintained, in part, by a
considerable drop in the relative price of motor vehicles. During
the past year, the CPI for new cars and new trucks fell 1.0 and
0.1 percent, respectively, while the core CPI rose 2.2 percent. The
industry's standard rule-of-thumb of a (negative) unitary elasticity
of demand would imply that sales of light motor vehicles were
400,000 units higher in 1997 than they would have been if motor
vehicle prices had moved in tandem with core CPI. (The unitary
elasticity is in the middle of the range of published econometric
estimates of minus 1/3 to minus 1-1/2.)
In the near term, the industry's strategy appears to be to
continue pricing to keep sales in the 15-million-plus bracket.
Their plans for incentives in the first quarter remain in the
relatively high range that we have seen over the past several years.
In turn, attractive pricing has helped sustain upbeat consumer
attitudes toward buying conditions for cars. The preliminary
January results from the Michigan SRC survey indicate that buying
attitudes remain in the elevated range seen over the last several
years.
Housing Markets
The housing sector has remained buoyant in recent months,
fueled by sharp declines in fixed mortgage rates during the second
half of last year and by further sizable gains in employment and
personal income. To be sure, single-family starts were at a
surprisingly weak 1.09 million unit annual rate in December, down
6 percent from the robust November pace and noticeably below the
average reading for the year. However, adjusted permits for these
units, which provide a better short-run indication of the underlying

trend, edged up 1/2 percent in December to a level a touch above the
1997 average.
Other indicators of housing demand strengthened at year-end.
Existing home sales were at a 4.29 million unit annual rate in
December; in the fourth quarter as a whole, these sales averaged
4.35 million units, up 2 percent from the third-quarter pace. New
home sales rose to an 830,000 unit annual rate in November, the
highest monthly pace in more than ten years. Builders' ratings of
new home sales, which have been trending up since last winter, rose
a bit further in January. In addition, according to the preliminary
reading from the Michigan SRC survey, consumers' assessments of
homebuying conditions, which rebounded in January, have been quite
positive, on net, since early last fall. Applications for mortgages
to purchase homes rose to a new monthly high in December, and the
average reading through January 23 was up 13 percent from the
December level.7
Multifamily starts jumped to a 427,000 unit annual rate in
December--the highest since early 1990. This followed relatively
high levels of starts in both October and November. For the fourth
quarter as a whole, multifamily starts averaged 401,000 units, up
26 percent from the pace seen earlier last year. Permits for these
units also moved up in the fourth quarter, but not nearly so much as
starts, suggesting that starts will drop back in the next few
months.
Some tightening may be occurring in the multifamily market;
Real rents have trended up during the past year, and the vacancy
rate for rental units has edged lower, on net, since late 1995.
Nevertheless, industry contacts think that the ready availability of
financing may be spurring developers to undertake excessive
construction.
Business Fixed Investment
Real outlays for producers' durable equipment and for
nonresidential structures appeared to stall in the fourth quarter,

which typically is around the same time that the buyer applies for a
mortgage. By contrast, existing home sales are recorded at closing,
which usually is a month or two after the time that a mortgage
application is submitted. As a result, mortgage applications for
home purchase show a strong contemporaneous correlation with new
home sales, and they tend to lead existing home sales by an average
of about a month and a half.

after having expanded at a heady pace earlier in the year.
Nonetheless, the economic environment remains supportive for
business investment: Business output has accelerated over the past
two years, corporate cash flow is healthy, and the real user cost of
capital remains low.
Led by higher shipments of office and computing equipment,
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased
3-1/4 percent in December. This rapid growth was not enough to
offset the sizable declines in shipments registered in October and
November, and for the fourth quarter as a whole shipments fell8
0.3 percent.
Nominal shipments of office and computing equipment subsided in
the fourth quarter despite a large increase in December, which
returned the level of shipments close to its trend level. After
factoring in the declining prices in this sector, real office and
computing expenditures likely decelerated sharply in the fourth
quarter, rising perhaps 10 percent. Shipments of communications
equipment fell in the fourth quarter, despite a strong performance
in December, and real outlays probably posted a slight decline last
quarter.
In the transportation area, sales of medium and heavy trucks
remained an area of strength; sales were about 450,000 units (annual
rate) last quarter, noticeably above the already high reading in the
third quarter. In addition, net new orders of heavy trucks rose to
the highest level in more than three years. However, real business
expenditures on aircraft appear to have declined in the fourth
quarter. Although deliveries by domestic manufacturers rose, net
exports of aircraft are expected to more than account for the
increase.
Outside of the information technology and transportation
sectors, nominal shipments of capital goods rose 1.1 percent in
December after having declined, on balance, over the preceding two
8. Data on shipments of capital goods are one of the basic
building blocks that the BEA uses to estimate producers' durable
equipment expenditures. However, the shipments data include capital
goods that are exported and do not include capital goods purchased
by U.S. businesses from abroad. Accordingly, to calculate equipment
spending by U.S. producers, the BEA subtracts out estimates of net
exports of capital goods, which are based on international trade
data. The latest available data indicate a slight increase in net
exports of capital goods in October and November, providing some
additional weakness in PDE relative to that indicated by the
shipments data in those months.

months. New orders in this category dropped about 1.7 percent in
December, largely erasing the backlog of unfilled orders.
Although real estate prices are up and vacancy rates are down,
the available indicators suggest that real spending on
nonresidential structures declined in the fourth quarter. Initial
estimates indicate that construction put in place for nonresidential
buildings fell 3.8 percent in November. However, this decline comes
on the heels of an upward-revised 1.1 percent gain in October.9
The pace of construction contracts has also eased over the past six
months; the weak readings in this sector are surprising given the
favorable financing environment and improved market conditions.
Business Inventories
Over the first two months of the fourth quarter, businesses
outside of the motor vehicle sector accumulated inventories at an
average pace of around $45 billion (annual rate) on a book-value
basis, up from a $37 billion rate in the third quarter.
Manufacturers' inventories accumulated at a relatively rapid pace in
both October and November. Stock-building in October was boosted by
a $16 billion accumulation of inventories of aircraft and parts, a
development that was most likely a result of the production and
delivery disruptions at Boeing.10 Inventories at chemical
manufacturers posted large increases in both months that may have
been related to rail transportation problems. With shipments
declining, the inventory-shipments ratio for manufacturing increased
in November but remained within the narrow range of the past year.
In wholesale trade, stocks continued to build, and the
inventory-sales ratio has maintained the upward trend evident over
the past year; by November, the ratio had reversed the 1996 decline.
This V-shaped pattern was widespread but was especially evident in
furniture, lumber, apparel, and farm products. Excluding motor
vehicles, wholesale stocks rose at a $6 billion annual rate in
October and at a $29 billion rate in November. The accumulation of
9. In each of the months since last June's comprehensive
revision, the preliminary construction data for nonresidential
structures have been revised up in the following month. Analysts at
the Census Bureau believe that this string of positive initial
revisions is purely coincidental and not due to any change in their
reporting procedures. Furthermore, later downward revisions have
tended to undo many of the initial upward revisions.
10. Boeing's aircraft deliveries, excluding those of McDonnell
Douglas, slumped from an average of 27 planes per month in the third
quarter to 17 in October and 18 in November. Although 45 planes
were delivered in December, another 12 planes completed for delivery
were not shipped because of payment problems.

stocks of farm products was particularly strong in October when the
harvest was speeding along at a faster-than-usual pace. Wholesale
inventories of groceries also surged. In the retail sector, the
sluggish growth in sales in October and November did not lead to a
backup in inventories. Indeed, retail inventories fell at a
$5 billion annual rate in October and were little changed in
November. The inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers remained
close to its twelve-month low.
Federal Government
Favorable numbers in the last two months of 1997 left the
federal budget for the calendar year in deficit by just $2 billion.
After adjusting for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit
insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, the deficit was $19 billion
in calendar 1997, $108 billion lower than a year earlier.
Outlays grew moderately in the fourth quarter and for the year
were only 2.3 percent above the 1996 level. Defense expenditures
edged down further, spending growth for health programs continued to
moderate, and debt service payments flattened. Declines in the
number of food stamp recipients, unemployment insurance
beneficiaries, and welfare cases led to a leveling-off of income
security payments.11 Receipts continued to grow more rapidly than
nominal income; fourth-quarter receipts were 12 percent above a year
earlier. December receipts included the last of the four payments
by corporations on their estimated 1997 income tax liabilities;
these payments were 13 percent above a year earlier. The last of
the four quarterly payments by individuals on their estimated 1997
income and social insurance tax liabilities were due on January 15.
Daily data indicate that these payments were well above the year-
earlier level.
The Congressional Budget Office released its "Economic and
Budget Outlook for Fiscal Years 1999-2008." The CBO now projects an
essentially balanced federal budget over the next ten years if
current policies remain unchanged.
These budget projections are more favorable than those released
in September, with deficits about $50 billion smaller than
forecasted at that time. About half of the near-term improvement
stems from more upbeat economic assumptions; changes in the longer-
term economic outlook had a negligible effect on the deficit
11. The income security function includes retirement programs (for
federal employees and others), housing programs, and most of the
low-income support programs.

1998 through 2002 and to grow at the rate of inflation in succeeding
years. The projections include social security and the Postal Service,
which are off-budget.

projections. Instead, most of the improvement over the longer run
reflects downward revisions to the growth in outlays because the
unexpectedly slow growth in Medicaid and other mandatory programs in
recent years is expected to be more persistent. In addition, the
CBO boosted its estimate of income tax receipts, under an assumption
that the forces behind the recent surge will fade more slowly than
previously projected. By fiscal 2007, outlays in the CBO forecast
drop to just 18.3 percent of GDP, well below the norm for the past
thirty years, largely as a result of a continuing decline in
discretionary spending as a share of GDP. Similarly, revenues are
projected to remain high relative to GDP, although the share does
fall between 1998 and 2003, in part because of the phase-in of last
year's tax cuts.
State and Local Government
Available data suggest that spending on consumption and
investment by state and local governments grew at a moderate pace in
the fourth quarter. Employment edged up in the fourth quarter,
suggesting a moderate gain in real consumption. (Compensation
accounts for 60 percent of the state and local sector's contribution
to GDP.) Among investment items, real construction outlays, which
account for most of the sector's investment spending, rebounded
somewhat in October after trending down from its record last
February. Despite a backward slide in November, the average for the
two months stands well above that for the third quarter. In
particular, highway construction jumped to an unusually high level
in November.
With growth in total consumption plus investment spending less
than GDP growth in recent years, and revenue growth relatively
strong, the sector has remained in good fiscal health. And the
latest survey just published by the National Conference of State
Legislators indicates that fiscal 1998 is likely to be another good
year. All but one state, Alaska, reported that revenues are coming
in on target or better so far this fiscal year. Likewise, spending
also appears to be on target. Survey respondents report that key
budget issues for legislatures this winter and spring will center on
K-12 education funding, tax cuts or tax reform, and the funding of
corrections programs and transportation.

Prices
The consumer price index rose just 1.7 percent during 1997,
well below its 3.3 percent pace over the previous year.12 The
latest news on prices has remained quite favorable, with the CPI
rising just 0.1 percent in both November and December. Continued
weakness in import prices and declining energy prices have
restrained consumer prices recently. At the same time, lower prices
for many industrial commodities suggest no inflationary pressures at
earlier stages of processing.
The CPI for energy fell 1.6 percent in December after a small
decline in November. Gasoline prices moved lower for the third
consecutive month; heating oil prices also retreated. In addition,
electricity and natural gas prices dropped back as unseasonably warm
weather eased demand. Overall, energy prices declined 3-1/2 percent
last year after having surged 8-1/2 percent in 1996. All types of
energy contributed to this deceleration, although the large swings
in prices of gasoline and heating oil accounted for more than half
of the slowing.
Retail food prices were little changed in November and
December. The favorable news on food prices has been widespread
across categories, and grocery prices in coming months likely will
be held down by the recent declines in spot and futures prices for
both crop and livestock commodities. An exception to the recent
pattern in the food area is the index for food away from home, which
has picked up; it rose 0.3 percent in November and 0.4 percent in
December. In the last Greenbook, we noted that September's minimum
wage increase appeared to have had little effect on the CPI for food
away from home through October, but more recent data suggest that
the effects of higher wage costs may simply have come later than
expected. Even with the recent uptick in that component, the
overall food CPI rose just 1-1/2 percent during 1997, nearly
3 percentage points less than its pace during the prior year.
Outside of food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in
December after having increased just 0.1 percent in November. Over
last year as a whole, the core CPI was up 2.2 percent, almost
12. About every ten years, the CPI undergoes a major revision. In
the next CPI release, the BLS will implement most of the changes
that are part of the 1998 major revision, including updated
expenditure weights, a revised item structure, and a new index for
computer prices.

1/2 percentage point less than the pace registered during 1996.13
Deceleration was evident among prices of both goods and services,
although it was not universal across all categories. Within goods,
the deceleration was concentrated in the durables category, where
falling import prices have been an especially important restraining
influence. In particular, prices of new and used motor vehicles
decelerated considerably in 1997 and accounted for more than half of
the slowing in the core CPI last year. In contrast to durable
goods, price increases for nondurable goods picked up last year,
with accelerating prices for tobacco and apparel. Among services
other than energy, airfares--which dropped back last year after
having popped up during 1996--more than accounted for the
deceleration; shelter costs accelerated somewhat over 1997.
Other broad measures of inflation have also slowed recently; as
of 1997:Q3, four-quarter changes in chain price indexes for GDP and
for PCE excluding food and energy were down 0.4 percentage point
from their pace at the end of 1996, similar to the pattern for the
14core CPI. However, some alternative measures of the underlying
trend in the CPI have not slowed as much as the published core CPI.
In particular, the median CPI--calculated by the Cleveland Fed--
showed no deceleration over the past year.15 The difference is
due to the fact that over the past year prices decelerated
substantially for a relatively small number of items in the CPI,
such as motor vehicles. Large decelerations for a few important
items can have a big effect on changes in the overall and core CPI
but little or no effect on the median CPI. Nonetheless, movements
in the median CPI should be interpreted cautiously because yet
another alternative--the trimmed mean CPI--tells a story more like
that of the core CPI.16
13. Technical changes to the CPI are estimated to have accounted
for almost 0.1 percentage point of slowing in core CPI inflation in
1997.
14. Fourth-quarter figures for PCE and GDP prices will be released
on January 30. In these figures, we anticipate that the extra
holiday received by federal workers on December 26 will boost the
increase in the GDP chain price index by 0.1 percentage point at an
annual rate. This effect will be reversed in the first quarter.
15. The median CPI is constructed by ranking price changes of
individual items in the CPI, applying relative importance weights to
these changes, and selecting the price change at the 50th percentile
of this weighted distribution.
16. Indeed, the Cleveland Fed's trimmed-mean CPI (which excludes
the categories with the largest and smallest price increases)
decelerated even more in 1997 than did the core CPI. Differences

Inflation expectations as measured by the Michigan SRC index
also came down over the past year. In the fourth quarter of last
year, one-year-ahead median expectations were about 1/4 percentage
point lower than a year earlier, while mean expectations dropped
about 3/4 percentage point. The preliminary reading for January
indicates that these expectations fell substantially further,
although those figures probably should be taken with a grain of salt
until the final--full sample--readings are released at the end of
January.
Prices of capital equipment in the PPI edged down 0.2 percent
further in December, with declines for motor vehicles as well as
other types of capital equipment. Just as for durable goods in the
CPI, prices of capital goods in 1997 appear to have been restrained
by weak import prices: The PPI for capital goods fell 1/2 percent
last year, compared with an increase of about 1/2 percent registered
during 1996.17
At earlier stages of processing, prices continue to be subdued.
The PPI for core intermediate materials edged down in December and
was up only 0.3 percent over 1997 as a whole. The index for core
crude materials dropped another 1.5 percent in December after having
declined 0.7 percent in November. As a result of ample supplies and
softening demand on world markets, prices of many industrial
commodities are, on balance, considerably below their levels in mid-
December. Although the most recent weekly observations suggest that
these indexes may have stopped declining, the Journal of Commerce
index of industrial prices is down 4 percent, and the CRB index of
spot industrials is off 3-1/4 percent.18
Labor Costs
According to the Employment Cost Index, hourly compensation of
private industry workers increased at a seasonally adjusted annual
(Footnote continued from previous page)
between the median, trimmed mean, and core CPI reflect subtle
asymmetries in the distribution of price changes across items in the
CPI, and the implications that one should draw from these
differences are not obvious.
17. Because the PPI includes only domestically produced capital
goods, imported capital goods affect these prices only through the
competing goods effect. The BLS price measure for imported capital
goods (excluding motor vehicles) fell about 7 percent in 1997.
18. Price changes in the Journal of Commerce index are
standardized to take account of the historical volatility of each
price.

rate of 4.9 percent in the three months ended in December. Over
1997 as whole, this measure of hourly compensation rose 3.4 percent,
up 0.3 percentage point from its pace in the prior year.
Over the final three months of last year, the pickup in hourly
compensation reflected an acceleration in wages and salaries as well
as in benefit costs. Developments in the finance, insurance, and
real estate (FIRE) industry contributed importantly to the pickup in
both wages and benefits, adding about a percentage point to the
increase in overall ECI compensation. Wages and salaries in FIRE
were boosted considerably by the sizable commissions generated from
the recent wave of mortgage refinancings, and nonproduction bonuses,
included in benefits, also increased substantially in this
industry.19
The year-end developments in FIRE largely accounted for the
acceleration in hourly compensation between 1996 and 1997.
Elsewhere, hourly compensation accelerated noticeably in the
business services industry, where anecdotal reports of labor
shortages for some occupations, such as computer specialists and
skilled temporary workers, have been common. Wages also picked up
in the health services industry after posting a relatively small
increase in 1996. In contrast, hourly compensation in goods-
producing industries and in the retail and wholesale trade sector
decelerated last year.
The occupational detail suggests that the minimum wage also
provided a boost to compensation gains in the past year. Of the
three broad occupational categories, the services group has the
highest concentration of low-wage occupations. Compensation in this
category was up 4.0 percent over the past year; this compares with a
3.0 percent rise in 1996 (when the minimum wage was also increased)
and a 1.9 percent rise in 1995. As for timing of the minimum wage
effect within the year, the quarterly pattern of compensation in
service occupations suggests that much of the impact of last
September's minimum wage hike occurred in the third quarter. At
annual rates, compensation for service occupations increased
6.9 percent during the three months ending in September, but only
2.4 percent over the three-month period through December.
Over the past year, benefit costs increased 2.3 percent,
compared with a 2.0 percent gain in 1996. In addition to large
19. The detail on bonuses is based on unpublished and confidential
information received from BLS.

II-44
bonuses in financial services, year-end bonuses were apparently
sizable in a variety of other industries as well. Health insurance
costs increased 0.9 percent last year, compared with an increase of
200.4 percent in the prior year.
Overall, tight labor markets appear to have sustained nominal
compensation gains last year even as favorable developments in
product markets led to a slowing of price inflation. Adjusted for
inflation by the nonfarm business chain price index, real ECI
compensation is expected to show an increase of nearly 2 percent in
1997, almost 1 percentage point more than in 1996.21
20. For 1998, other information suggests some acceleration in
health care costs. According to a recent survey of 150 large firms
conducted by Towers Perrin, health care costs faced by these
companies are expected to rise 4 percent this year, compared with
3 percent last year. In addition, health care premiums for
employees of the federal government increased an average of
8-1/2 percent between 1997 and 1998.
21. The figure for real ECI compensation for 1997 requires a
forecast of the price measure for the nonfarm business sector for
the fourth quarter. BEA will publish this number on January 30.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The decision by the FOMC to keep policy on hold at the December
meeting had been anticipated and thus market yields were unaffected.
But, in subsequent weeks, more bad news from Asia and more good news
on U.S. inflation caused nominal interest rates to fall 10 to
40 basis points, the largest declines being posted at intermediate
maturities (chart). The slide in rates was attributed in part to a
flight to the relative safety and liquidity of dollar assets,
particularly nominal Treasury securities. More recently, that rate
decline was largely reversed, as some Asian economies were perceived
to be stabilizing. Uncertainty associated with the President's
legal problems also appeared to be a factor.
Federal funds futures rates, which were flat at the time of the
December FOMC meeting, now slope downward (chart). With the
contract for June currently about 8 basis points below the intended
rate of 5-1/2 percent, market participants apparently see a
significant chance of policy easing before midyear.
Since the last FOMC meeting, major equity indexes have
registered mixed changes, amid considerable volatility that has been
closely associated with frequent, large swings in prices on Asian
markets and mixed signals on earnings growth prospects. On balance,
the Dow Jones Index was little changed, while the NASDAQ rose
2-3/4 percent, reversing some of its relative underperformance
during the fall.
The decline in interest rates created an inviting market for
bond issuance, and this has tilted heavy business credit demands
toward the bond market. Bank C&I loans also have been rising
rapidly of late, reportedly fueled by inventory growth and brisk
merger activity. In contrast, the shakier stock market environment
has trimmed new equity offerings. Borrowing by households in recent
months appears to have stayed around its moderate third-quarter
pace; with the decline in rates, this portends a slight easing of
the burden of debt payments. Net borrowing by the Treasury remains
minimal. Lower rates on tax-exempt bonds have boosted bond
issuance--and overall borrowing--by the state and local sector.
Growth in the broader monetary aggregates has been robust in recent
months.

Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations maintained a
moderate $12 billion monthly pace in December, with some potential
issuers apparently staying on the sidelines anticipating still
lower yields (table). In early January, when corporate bond yields
in fact touched their lowest levels in more than two decades,
issuance surged. Based on proceeds raised through January 26,
issuance in January will easily top $20 billion, well ahead of the
brisk $16-1/2 billion pace in the fourth quarter. Issuance has been
particularly heavy in the investment-grade sector, where a
significant chunk of the proceeds apparently has been used to pay
down commercial paper. Speculative-grade bond offerings slowed to
$5-1/2 billion in December--a healthy pace, but one that pales byMay June-15.8
'"

III-3
comparison with last year's record monthly average of almost
$8 billion.
Over the intermeeting period, interest rates on high-yield debt
fell only about 10 basis points, resulting in a slight increase in
quality spreads. The widening in spreads did not appear to reflect
greater concern about default risk but, rather, the marked
preferences of those fleeing emerging markets for the liquidity of
Treasuries and top-quality corporates. Indeed, the spread of junk
over Treasury rates was a great deal wider in early January, before
Treasury yields retraced some of their recent declines.
The effects of the Asian crisis on corporate fortunes have
become a major focus for equity investors. Although U.S. stock
price indexes show small mixed changes over the intermeeting period,
this masks some sizable weekly swings (chart, top panel). Because
money center banks and technology firms have relatively large
exposures to Asia, their stock prices have been especially volatile,
with the money center banks registering large declines since mid-
December. Equities in the energy and basic materials sectors were
roiled by the declines in oil and other commodity prices--both
related at least in part to Asian developments.
With about half of the S&P 500 firms thus far reporting fourth-
quarter earnings, it appears that, on balance, corporate earnings
once again have come in above analysts' downward-revised
projections. Positive surprises have outnumbered negative surprises
by a margin of about five to three, a bit less favorable balance
than in the last several quarters. Some of the biggest positive
surprises have come from the airline industry; firm prices and
declining fuel costs have produced big profits in this sector. In
the computer-related technology sector, earnings have mostly run a
bit above the most recent consensus projections. Perhaps more
important for share prices, though, several major companies in this
sector have indicated that declining demand in Asia or the strong
U.S. dollar will have a significant negative effect on first-half
performance.
If earnings reports continue the pattern seen to date, the
four-quarter growth in S&P 500 earnings per share is estimated to
have slowed to around 8 or 9 percent, from 12 percent in the third
quarter (middle left panel). This might be consistent with a small
quarter-over-quarter gain in economic profits on a seasonally
adjusted basis.

III-6
Despite the market's preoccupation with Asian problems, equity
analysts have not yet marked down longer-term earnings prospects
much. Since mid-October, average year-ahead earnings projections
for S&P 500 firms have been lowered only about 1/2 percent per month
(middle right panel). Nearly all of the recent downward adjustments
are accounted for by revisions to technology sector projections.
Currently, company-analyst ("bottom-up") projections for S&P 500
earnings in 1998 still imply an expectation that earnings will grow
13-1/2 percent (not shown). While analysts' long-term growth
projections have stopped rising, they remain at record high levels
(lower left panel).
The increase in stock market volatility in late October had
little immediate effect on the pace of equity issuance, as November
saw a near-record number of IPOs by nonfinancial companies,
resulting in $3.6 billion in new issues. But IPO price performance
deteriorated significantly in late November and December: average
one-day returns on IPOs dropped to around 7 percent, from more than
20 percent in October (lower right panel). Partly as a result,
nonfinancial IPOs raised a paltry $0.8 billion in December and
failed to pick up in January after the normal seasonal lull early in
the month.
Meanwhile, equity retirements have remained very strong.
Companies continue to announce stock repurchase plans at a near-
record pace, and merger activity involved about $30 billion in
equity retirements during the fourth quarter. Only $8 billion of
this came from megamergers, while the number of minimergers
(combinations of companies under $1 billion in capitalization) was
the largest for any quarter during the current merger wave. The
$22 billion of equity retired from these minimergers likely boosted
bank loan growth late in the year, because many of the acquirers
have limited access to securities markets for debt financing.
The fourth quarter saw very few ratings changes for U.S.
corporations. Over the course of the year, upgrades were balanced
by downgrades in the nonfinancial sector. Although a large amount
of nonfinancial debt was recently put on Moody's watchlist for
downgrades, much of it was related to recent and prospective
mergers. None of the additions appeared to be the result of Asia-
related or general economic concerns.

III-7
Household Sector
After interest rates on new fixed-rate home mortgages dropped
below 7 percent, homeowners scrambled to refinance their mortgage
loans. Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association's refinancing
application index surged to a record high in early January (chart).
While this signals an extraordinary level of refinancing activity,
some of that increase probably reflects heavy multiple application
filing by customers fearful that backed-up mortgage bankers will not
be able to process their forms promptly.
The volume of refinancing had already been rising for several
months, as borrowers--including many holding ARMs--sought to lock in
lower long-term rates. In total, prepayment activity for all of
1997 is estimated to have reduced interest costs about
$5-1/2 billion, only a fraction of the $33 billion in estimated
savings from the major refinancing wave in 1993, when rates last
broke below 7 percent. The staff estimates that, if mortgage rates
were to settle in near 7 percent during the months ahead, then
refinancing could reduce annualized mortgage payments about $16 to
$24 billion in 1998, all else the same.
Overall, growth in household debt appeared moderate during the
fourth quarter. Various indicators point to a pickup in mortgage
debt growth last quarter from the sluggish third-quarter pace, but
only a smattering of hard data is yet available to confirm this.
Smoothing through month-to-month volatility, growth in nonmortgage
consumer credit continued on its path of gradual deceleration. An
outsized gain in October was followed in November by a contraction
of 4 percent (annualized): for the two months combined, consumer
credit grew at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate, a bit slower than in the
second and third quarters. December and January figures on banks'
consumer loans suggest consumer credit growth remains subdued. The
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey results suggest continued
selective tightening of standards on credit card and other consumer
loans.
Given growth in household debt that only slightly outpaced that
of income last year and the downward drift in average interest rates
on the stock of debt, the ratio of debt-service payments to
disposable income is estimated to have stabilized at 17 percent in
1997, a bit below the highs recorded in 1989 (lower panel). If the
interest savings from possible mortgage refinancings noted above

should materialize, then, all else the same, the debt-service bure
ratio would be reduced about 1/3 percentage point.
Evidence on loan payment performance for the fourth quarter i
scant, limited mainly to monthly reports from the major domestic
auto finance companies. A drop in the delinquency rate on auto
loans at these firms in September pulled the third-quarter average
below the previous quarter's reading. Company reports for Octobel
and November indicate that delinquencies remain near their Septeml
level, and down from their average level in the third quarter.
Government Finance
Treasury borrowing has remained subdued, held down by favoral
budget developments and a drawdown of cash balances that had been
boosted by unusually strong tax inflows. In January, the Treasuri
held its third auction of ten-year, price-index-linked securities
The $8 billion sale of securities--at a yield of 3-5/8 percent--
brought the total outstanding stock of indexed securities to
$41 billion, about 1 percent of total U.S. marketable debt. The
auction drew about three times as many bids as there were securit:
available for sale, comparable to typical demand for nominal
securities. Yields on Treasury index-linked securities had actua.
inched up in December and early January, while nominal Treasury bi
yields were declining, perhaps reflecting the oncoming supply and
the preference for more liquid securities amid volatile financial
markets; but, since the day preceding the auction, index-linked
Treasury yields have edged down, even as nominal yields backed up
While flight to quality has at times clearly boosted demands
for Treasury securities, also purportedly weighing on the market
have been concerns that the troubled economies of Asia and the
associated speculative attacks in Latin America and Eastern Europ
might lead foreign holders--both private and public--to sell some
their Treasury securities in large volume. As yet, no massive sa
have materialized. However, foreign official holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities in custody at the New York Federal Reserve Ba
have fallen about $40 billion from their September peak (chart).
The most notable official sales in the fourth quarter were by
Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.
Spreads between agency-issued securities and Treasuries have
held steady over the intermeeting period, even as government
sponsored enterprises resumed issuance in global markets after a
lull late last year. Recent issuers include Fannie Mae ($4 billi

and Freddie Mac ($1 billion). The bulk of the issuance was
denominated in U.S. dollars. On the domestic scene, the Tennessee
Valley Authority refinanced a portion of its debt by issuing
$1 billion in the forty-year sector.
Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities increased in
December to $21-1/4 billion for the month, about equal to the
fourth-quarter pace (table). Both new capital issues and refundings
were strong in December, as yields on long-term tax-exempts declined
to their lowest levels since 1993. Although preliminary data show
issuance in January slowing a bit, it is still quite strong.
Money and Bank Credit
Bank credit expanded at about a 10 percent annual rate in
December, maintaining the robust pace observed earlier in the fourth
quarter. Also following the pattern in recent months, the increase
in bank credit was heavily weighted toward securities holdings, a
somewhat puzzling development given that loan demand has continued
solid; adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules, securities in
December expanded at about a 25 percent pace.
Total loans increased at a 5-1/2 percent rate in December,
driven by strong business lending, which rose at a 14 percent pace
that month. In addition, there were substantial sales of loans to
pools in the form of issuance of collateralized loan obligations
(CLOs); including these loans in net business loan originations
would boost bank business lending in December substantially further.
The strength in business lending likely reflected borrowing related
to mergers and acquisitions and inventory accumulation, as well as
perhaps some substitution of bank loans for commercial paper
issuance at year-end. Results from the latest Senior Loan Officer
survey suggest a continued accommodative stance toward business
lending, although less easing of standards than in other recent
surveys. Aside from some Japanese respondents, whose lending
apparently has been crimped by their capital positions, the survey
found no evidence of a tightening in credit standards.
To fund strong bank credit expansion, the broader aggregates
have continued to grow briskly in December and January. M2 expanded
at an annual rate near 6-1/2 percent last month, pulling up its
growth for 1997 (Q4 to Q4) as a whole to 5-1/4 percent, slightly

above its annual range.1 Rapid M2 growth has persisted into
January, when it likely has been boosted by robust increases in
income and perhaps by a greater preference for safe assets as
financial markets remained more turbulent. M3 expanded 10 percent
in December, bringing its growth last year to 8-1/4 percent, far
above its 2 to 6 percent annual range; this aggregate too has
continued to expand briskly in January. Banks continued to raise
large amounts of funds through issuance of managed liabilities. In
addition, Eurodollar deposits and institution-only money market
mutual funds grew at a stunning pace in December.
Mutual Funds
Preliminary monthly estimates from the ICI indicate that net
sales of mutual funds continued strong in December. Net sales of
equity funds are estimated at $18 billion for the month, roughly
matching the pace of the two prior months and the first half of 1997
but below the $22 billion monthly pace of the third quarter.
Estimates for individual fund types are not yet available owing to
complications in measuring the levels of reinvestment of year-end
fund distributions; however, preliminary results suggest flows to
international funds continued to be weak in December. Net sales
of bond funds for December are estimated at $8.5 billion, the second
highest monthly total for 1997, off from $10.4 billion in November.
Available information about January flows presents somewhat
contradictory patterns. Representatives of some major fund families
suggest very strong flows in early January, particularly in 401(k)
plans and IRAs. By contrast, data from commercial surveys depict
sluggish flows in the first half of January, with some indications
of a pickup more recently. Sources generally agree that early
January figures continued to show that demands for international
funds remained off their earlier peaks, while flows to bond funds
were strong.
1. The monetary aggregates data incorporate revisions from the
annual benchmark and seasonal review. These data are scheduled to
be published in early February and until that time are strictly
confidential.
2. In December, flows to mutual funds generally contain large
automatic reinvestments of dividends and capital gains
distributions. Before receiving fund-level data, the ICI employs
complicated algorithms to quantify and remove reinvestments so that
the reported flows (net sales) more accurately depict new,
discretionary cash flowing from investors to mutual funds. The
results for this December were particularly problematic.

III-16
Liquidity ratios of equity funds ticked up from 5.5 percent in
October to 5.7 percent in November--the latest data available--but
remain well below the average level of recent years. Liquidity
ratios for bond funds held at around the average level of the 1990s.
Mutual funds report that they continue to rely on lines of credit to
supplement holdings of liquid assets in their management of
liquidity.

APPENDIX
THE JANUARY SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY
ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES
The January 1998 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank
Lending Practices (covering, for the most part, changes over the
past three months) posed the usual questions bearing on the supply
of and demand for bank loans to businesses and households.
Additional questions targeted changes in the sensitivity of
respondents' loan quality to an economic slowdown, changes in
standards and terms on home equity loans, and lending to affiliate
or subsidiaries of East Asian firms.
The domestic respondents indicated little change in standards
on loans to businesses, although a fairly large percentage narrowe
yield spreads. By contrast, foreign respondents (especially the
branches and agencies of Japanese banks) appear to be pulling back
from business lending, with many reporting tighter standards and
terms. Both domestic and foreign respondents took steps to restri
lending to U.S. affiliates of non-Japanese East Asian firms. At t
same time, demand from U.S. affiliates of Japanese firms increased
Many banks are still tightening standards on consumer loans,
but few said that their willingness to make these loans had change
Standards for residential mortgage loans were about unchanged, but
demand for such loans increased at a large percentage of
respondents. Several banks eased terms and standards on home equi
loans.
Special questions elicited broadly different opinions among t
respondents as to the change in their customers' ability to meet
their debt obligations during a period of economic weakness. A fe
more banks said that, overall, their loan portfolio had become moi
vulnerable to a downturn than said it had become less vulnerable.
Lending to Businesses
The survey results suggest somewhat less easing of business
loan standards and terms than did last year's surveys. For domest
respondents, one bank, on net, tightened standards both on C&I loE
to small and to larger businesses. Recent surveys had found small
fractions of banks easing business lending standards. Also for bc
size categories, about 25 percent of the domestic respondents
reported some narrowing of yield spreads; for loans to large
borrowers, this was a somewhat smaller percentage than in recent
surveys. Less than 10 percent eased other terms such as the size
and cost of credit lines, loan covenants, and collateralization
requirements; in general, these percentages have also fallen a bil
Many branches and agencies--primarily those of Japanese bank!
reported curtailing their lending, likely reflecting in part the
economic turmoil in Asia. More than one-third of the branches an<
agencies reported tighter standards on C&I loans, and nearly two-
thirds widened spreads. Significant fractions also decreased the
size and increased the cost of credit lines. The respondents
attributed the tightening to a weakening of their parents' curren-
or expected capital position.
III-A-1

III-A-2
On net, about 25 percent of the domestic banks experienced
increased demand for business loans from larger firms, and 15
percent reported stronger demand from small firms. Most frequently,
the increased demand was attributed to merger and acquisition
funding needs, but the need for plant and equipment and inventory
financing was also cited. The importance accorded to inventory
financing needs was about the same as that reported in the November
survey and a little less than that in the August survey. Few
branches and agencies reported a change in business loan demand.
Less than 10 percent of the domestic respondents, on net,
eased standards on commercial real estate loans, about the same as
in November. By contrast, a net 15 percent of the foreign
respondents tightened standards on these loans. Large net fractions
of the participants--two-fifths of the domestic and one-third of the
foreign respondents--experienced increased demand for these loans,
larger fractions than reported a pickup in demand in November.
Lending to Households
The responses concerning consumer loans resembled those on
recent surveys. On net, one bank expressed greater willingness to
make consumer installment loans, 20 percent tightened standards on
credit card loans, and 15 percent tightened standards on other
consumer loans. While the current survey is the ninth in a row to
find significant net percentages of banks tightening standards on
consumer loans, the percentages have tailed off over the past year.
The survey revealed little evidence of any change in consumer loan
terms.
Standards applied to mortgage applications were about
unchanged. Many banks--three-fifths--reported increased demand for
these loans. Even though this question specifically refers to
mortgages to purchase homes, the large number of respondents
indicating increased demand may reflect, in part, the spike in
refinancing in January.
Special questions found modest evidence of eased standards and
terms for home equity loans. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of
the respondents, on net, eased standards on these loans over the
past year. Similar percentages reduced fees and raised maximum
loan-to-value ratios; somewhat smaller percentages narrowed spreads
and lengthened maturities. The responses suggest a degree of easing
similar to that found by the January 1997 survey.
Lending to Affiliates and Subsidiaries of East Asian Firms
The recent financial difficulties of many East Asian firms have
raised the possibility that lenders may be approaching the U.S.
affiliates of such firms with greater caution. In fact, the survey
found a widespread tightening of standards and terms on loans to
nonbank U.S. affiliates of Asian firms, excluding Japanese firms.
Two-thirds of the domestic respondents and all of the branches and
agencies had tightened their standards on loans to nonbank
affiliates or subsidiaries of Korean firms. Only slightly fewer
tightened standards on loans to non-Korean (and non-Japanese) firms.
All or nearly all of the survey participants had tightened terms on
these loans, including the size and cost of credit lines, yield
spreads, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements.

III-A-3
In the last few months, Japanese banks have been under pressure
to increase loan-loss reserves while maintaining capital ratios.
These requirements may have reduced the supply of credit in Japan,
possibly leading to a reduction in funding by Japanese parents to
their nonbank U.S. affiliates or subsidiaries. The survey did find
that about one-quarter of the domestic respondents, on net, and one-
half of the branches and agencies had experienced increased loan
demand from these firms. However, most of those institutions
experiencing increased demand attributed it to reduced
attractiveness of other sources of funds. Reduced funding from
parent firms was cited much less often, although still widely, as a
reason for the increased demand. Nevertheless, when increased loan
demand is the result of substitution away from alternative sources
of funds, it may be difficult for respondents to know the
alternative source.
Sensitivity of Loan Performance to a Recession
For the past couple of years, this survey and other sources
have reported an easing by banks of standards and terms for business
credit and a tightening for consumer credit. Special questions in
the current survey asked respondents to evaluate the effect that
these changes have had on the ability of their various customer
groups to meet debt obligations during a period of economic
weakness. Banks' responses differed fairly widely. About one-
quarter of the respondents, on net, felt that their commercial real
estate borrowers' ability to weather a downturn had improved over
the past two years. By contrast, on net about 20 percent felt that
their credit card customers, and about 10 percent their other
consumer loan borrowers, were in worse shape. It may be that the
tightening of standards on consumer loans has not offset the
deteriorating condition of some existing customers at these
institutions. Regarding commercial and industrial and residential
real estate borrowers, responses were quite dispersed, with fairly
large percentages of banks assessing their borrowers to be in better
condition and roughly equal percentages seeing deterioration.
Looking at their loan portfolios overall, about 25 percent of the
loan officers judged their banks' aggregate charge-off and
delinquency rates to be more sensitive to a downturn than they were
two years ago, and about 15 percent felt this sensitivity had
declined.

In November, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed
to $8.0 billion as imports dropped more than exports. The deficit in
October-November combined was much smaller at an annual rate than in the
third quarter and about equal to the deficit in the second quarter.

Exports declined slightly in November after jumping up in
October. Exports in October-November on average were 1.8 percent
higher than the third-quarter average. The sharpest increases were
in automotive and agricultural products, with strong increases also
recorded for exported consumer goods and machinery (other than
computers and semiconductors, which both declined). [Note: There is
little evidence in U.S data through November of a significant drop
in exports to developing countries in Asia, other than perhaps the
decline in the value of computers and semiconductors, and a moderate
decrease in exports to Korea.]
Imports dropped 2.3 percent in November with most of the
decline in oil (primarily quantity) and capital goods. The value of
imports in October-November on average were about the same as the
third-quarter average. Most of the change reflected increases in
imported consumer goods and machinery (other than computers and
semiconductors) that were about offset by declines in imported
automotive products, computers, and, to a lesser extent a wide range
of other products. For imported oil in October-November on average,
a decline in quantity was about offset by an increase in price.

Oil Imports and Prices
The quantity of imported oil declined sharply in November
following several months of moderate increases. As a result, for
October-November on average the quantity of imports was a bit less
than in the third quarter. This decline followed two consecutive
quarters of strong increases in oil imports, driven by extremely
robust consumption in the second and third quarters. Preliminary
department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports declined
again in December due to a substantial drawdown in stocks.
The price of imported oil declined in November and December
following increases in the previous three months. Nonetheless,
prices for the fourth quarter were 5 percent higher than the average
for the third quarter. The run-up in prices from late summer
through early fall reflected production disruptions in Colombia and
the lagged effect of Iraq not exporting for two months. Spot WTI
prices declined sharply in December as the market anticipated
increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. Spot
prices declined further in January because of weak demand in Asia,
relatively warm weather in the northeastern United States, and the
resumption of oil production for export by Iraq.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in December
for the third consecutive month. This decline was attributable to
decreases in all major trade categories with the exception of foods
and consumer goods. For the fourth quarter, non-oil import prices
decreased 2-1/4 percent at an annual rate, continuing a downward
trend that began in late 1995. There were price declines in all
major trade categories with the exception of automotive products.
Prices of exports declined slightly in December after
remaining unchanged in November. The decline was attributable to
lower prices for agricultural products and, to a lesser degree.
other industrial supplies, computers, semiconductors, and other
capital goods. For the fourth quarter, export prices decreased
moderately for the third consecutive quarter. Prices of
agricultural products declined significantly. Prices of
nonagricultural exports decreased 2-1/4 percent at an annual rate
with declines spread among all major trade categories with the
exception of automotive products and consumer goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
The flight to quality apparent in the very large October net
purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners was moderated
considerably in November (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). Private net purchases of U.S.
Treasury securities were still strong in November, but far below the
record pace of October (line 4a). The net was more than accounted
for by the Netherlands Antilles and the United Kingdom. Large
purchases of Treasury securities in October by residents of Japan
were reversed in November, probably because of the large increase in
the Japan premium during the month of November. Moreover, purchases
of Treasuries by Mexican residents fell by over $2.5 billion to
nearly zero in November. On the other hand, moderately large
purchases continued in Hong Kong.
Net purchases of corporate and other bonds by private
foreigners were unusually low in November (line 4b). New issues of
Eurobonds by U.S. corporations had been very strong in September and
October, but fell sharply in November and continued very weak in
December. The pace of corporate stock purchases by private
foreigners was moderate compared with that of the second and third
quarters (line 4c).
U.S. residents had quite modest net purchases of foreign
securities in November (line 5). The total included $3.2 billion of
net sales of foreign stocks; almost two-thirds of this total was
accounted for by net sales of Japanese stocks. U.S. residents also
had net stock sales in the $500 million range to residents of Brazil
and Mexico. In Asia, there were net stock purchases in Hong Kong
and Korea and net sales in the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia.
Foreign official assets held in the United States fell about
$7 billion in November (line 1); over half the fall was attributable
to Russia, with smaller decreases for Korea and Thailand.
Preliminary data from the FRBNY indicate a further overall decrease
in the $15 billion range for December, with a large part of this
decline due to Japan.
Banks in the United States reported small net inflows in
November (line 3). Monthly average data reported on the
International Banking Data table indicate a continuation of inflows
from own foreign offices and IBFs in December (line 1).

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the December FOMC meeting, the dollar has continued to
appreciate against most of the currencies of the Asian developing
economies. Against a weighted average of ten developing economy
currencies (eight of which are Asian currencies), the dollar has
appreciated almost 5 percent over the intermeeting period. Against
the currencies of the G-10 countries, the dollar peaked in early
January before declining late in the month. On balance, the dollar
has firmed slightly against these currencies, up 1 percent on a
trade-weighted basis.
Financial markets in Korea and Indonesia were particularly
volatile over the intermeeting period. In mid-December, after
Korean authorities abandoned the daily, ten-percent limit on
fluctuations in the won and Kim Dae-jung won the presidential
election, the value of the won and Korean share prices fell sharply
as the total of short-term, foreign currency obligations of Korean
borrowers became apparent. Markets stabilized in late December when
foreign banks agreed to a rollover of short-term obligations of
Korean financial institutions and disbursements from the IMF and
other international financial institutions were accelerated. On
balance, since the December FOMC meeting, the won has fallen more
than 6-1/2 percent against the dollar; nevertheless, share prices in
Korea were up more than 34 percent.
While relatively tranquil in December, Indonesian markets have
fluctuated wildly in the new year. The rupiah fell sharply in early
January on the release of a budget for 1998 that was viewed as
unrealistic and inconsistent with Indonesia's program with the IMF.
The rupiah continued to plunge until mid-January when a series of
meetings involving Indonesian, IMF. and U.S. officials took place.
The meetings culminated with the announcement of a new program that
accelerates reforms intended to restructure the Indonesian economy.
Nevertheless, over the following week the rupiah continued to fall,
with President Suharto's decision to seek reelection providing
little calm to Indonesian markets. In the past two days, the rupiah
has firmed on the announcement of a debt renegotiation framework and
further banking sector reforms. Over the intermeeting period as a
whole, the rupiah has lost 48 percent of its value against the

dollar. Over the same period, Indonesian equity prices have risen
almost 43 percent.
Other Asian financial markets have been less volatile. The
currencies of most of these economies have depreciated against the
dollar, with the largest declines registered by the ringgit (11
percent) and baht (11 percent). Equity markets surged 18 percent in
Thailand, although they were up only 2 percent in Malaysia and down
21 percent in Singapore. Share prices have fallen 11 percent in
Hong Kong, with the largest declines coming on the news that
Peregrine Investments had filed for liquidation.
The dollar has depreciated more than 4 percent against the
yen. Over the first three weeks of the intermeeting period, the
dollar strengthened against the yen. Against a background of weak
economic news, the mid-December Japanese government proposal to
promote financial stability and economic recovery had little impact
on financial markets. Sizeable sales of dollars by Japanese
authorities around the time of the unveiling of the proposal also
had little lasting impact on the yen. The dollar peaked near ¥134
in early January and has fallen since then on three factors: 1)
talk of additional fiscal stimulus (beyond that contained in the
December proposal), 2) a period of relative stability and recovery
in some Asian developing economies, and 3) concerns over the fall-
out of the allegations involving President Clinton. Over the
intermeeting period as a whole, the interest differential between
ten-year bellwether bonds in Japan and the United States has
increased 30 basis points in favor of Japanese assets.
The dollar has appreciated a bit less than 2 percent against
the mark over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated
through early January as concerns began to emerge over the
ramifications of the crisis in Asia and amid comments by Bundesbank
officials that the dollar's rise was not troubling. Over the past
week, the mark has recouped some of these losses against the dollar
in response to a positive Ifo survey of the business climate and the
allegations against President Clinton. The German ten-year interest
rate has fallen 20 basis points since the December FOMC, 8 basis
points more than the decline in the comparable U.S. rate. Italian
long rates have fallen a bit further, in part reflecting the late-
December, 75 basis-point cut in official Italian rates.

IV-12
The dollar has gained more than 2-1/2 percent against the
Canadian dollar,
The Canadian dollar reached
historical lows against the U.S. dollar late this month following a
favorable CPI release and indications that the Bank of Canada is
content with the current level of monetary conditions. The ten-year
interest rate in Canada has declined 18 basis points more than the
comparable rate in the United States. At the three-month horizon,
the Canadian interest rate is little changed, while the U.S. three-

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in major foreign industrialized countries
appears to have continued to expand on average at a healthy clip in
the last quarter of 1997, with recent data indicating moderate to
robust growth in all countries except Japan. Although apparently
slowing somewhat from the third quarter, the pace of economic
expansion continued to be fairly strong in Canada, France, Germany
and the United Kingdom. Growth in Italy likely was weaker, but
still only slightly off the moderate pace recorded in the first nine
months of 1997. By contrast, indicators in Japan suggest persistent
weakness in economic activity. Despite some preliminary signs that
the southeast Asian crisis has begun to show up in forward-looking
indicators, the eventual impact of the crisis on the foreign
industrial economies remains uncertain.
Inflationary pressures have been subdued to nearly nonexistent
in all foreign G-7 countries except the United Kingdom. CPI
inflation is near or under 1-1/2 percent in France, Germany and
Italy, and under one percent in Canada. It is close to zero in
Japan, after netting out the effects of tax increases. In the
United Kingdom, however, consumer price inflation remains slightly
above the government's 2-1/2 percent target.
Individual country notes. In Japan, economic indicators for
the fourth quarter suggest continued weakness. Industrial

IV-13
production declined sharply in November, and industrial inventories
surged. Housing starts during October and November remained near
ten-year lows, and labor market conditions deteriorated. Household
expenditures during October and November were down from their third-
quarter level, but December auto registrations rebounded somewhat.
Inflation, net of the effects of fiscal measures, remains virtually
nonexistent.
The trade balance increased sharply during the fourth quarter,
with export volumes expanding and import volumes contracting.
Fourth-quarter trade data, however, provide the first glimpse of the
effects of the Asia crisis on Japanese trade, as exports to Thailand
and Korea registered sizable year-over-year declines. In addition,
foreign orders for machinery fell sharply in October and November.

In late December, the Japanese Cabinet approved a
supplementary budget for FY1997 and the regular budget for FY1998,
which begins in April. The supplementary budget includes a ¥2
trillion temporary income tax cut, as well as ¥1 trillion of new
spending for disaster relief and public works. The FY1998 budget
calls for ¥5 trillion of expenditure reductions, offset by about ¥1

IV-14
trillion of tax changes, including cuts in the corporate income tax,
the securities transactions tax, and real estate taxes. Taken
together, these measures, which are expected to gain rapid Diet
approval, suggest that fiscal policy would exert about a 1/4 percent
drag on GDP growth during calendar year 1998.
The Cabinet also approved the provision of ¥30 trillion (about
$230 billion) of public funds to the Deposit Insurance Corporation
(DIC) to address the banking system's difficulties. These funds
include ¥10 trillion of capital contribution bonds, which the DIC
may "cash" as resources are needed, and ¥20 trillion of government
guarantees for DIC borrowing from the Bank of Japan. Government
officials have indicated that ¥7 trillion of the capital
contribution bonds plus ¥10 trillion of BOJ lending are available,
if necessary, to protect depositors at failed banks. The remaining
funds may be used to recapitalize weak institutions or provide
capital to "rescue banks."
Also in late December, the government announced measures
intended to promote provision of credit. First, new lending
programs for small- and medium-sized firms will be established at
government-owned financial institutions. Second, banks that are
active only in the domestic market will not be subject to more
stringent capital-asset standards scheduled to take effect on
April 1. Third, Japanese banks will have the option of valuing
their equity holdings at historical cost, rather than at the minimum
of historical cost and market cost.
Japanese Finance Minister Mitsuzuka resigned on January 28,
after two senior Ministry of Finance bank examiners were arrested on
charges that they had accepted bribes from major banks in exchange
for information on inspection schedules. Mitsuzuka stated, "The
Ministry of Finance needs to be reborn. Major reforms are needed."
The banks involved in the scandal (Asahi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Sanwa Bank, and failed Hokkaido Takushoku Bank) issued statements of
regret.
Incoming data point to a continuation of the economic
expansion in Germany during the fourth quarter, but there are
tentative signs that the crisis in Asia has begun to affect the
outlook for exports. Industrial production rose 0.7 percent in
October-November from its level in the third quarter. Manufacturing

IV-15
orders remain at a high level despite declines in October-November.
However, the decline in October-November owed to a sharp drop in
orders from foreign firms, as domestic orders rose, and points to
diminished export prospects over the near term. Business confidence
also dropped back slightly in October and November but remained near
its highest level in almost three years. Conditions in the labor
market remain stagnant, however, with the all-German unemployment
rate edging up to 11.9 percent in December. To some extent, the
rise in unemployment in 1997 resulted from the termination of
government subsidized work programs in the eastern states (the
unemployment rate in eastern Germany rose from 16 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1996 to 19.8 percent in December). Price pressures
remain modest, with preliminary CPI inflation for January at 1.2
percent on a 12-month basis.

In France, economic activity in the fourth quarter is
estimated to have expanded at a solid pace slowing somewhat from its
rapid third-quarter rate. Domestic demand underpinned third-quarter
GDP, and fourth-quarter data support a continued broadening of

IV-16
growth beyond the export sector. In October-November, industrial
production was 2.0 percent above its third-quarter average. The
composition of increased manufacturing output was consistent with
strong foreign and domestic demand. Business surveys suggested that
manufacturing output accelerated in each month during the fourth
quarter. These surveys did not indicate that the slowing in Asian
economic activity or trucker's strike in November had impacted
production. The IP data, however, suggested that firms had
increased production in October in advance of the strike.
Consumption of manufactured products increased sharply in October
(owing to some special factors) and remained virtually flat in
November and December. Stores reported buoyant holiday spending in
December, and consumer sentiment remained at a high level. Although
the unemployment rate edged down in November to 12.4 percent (the
first decline in the rate of unemployment since September 1996), it
still was only slightly below its post-war high. Meanwhile,
inflationary pressures remain contained as consumer prices in
December were 1.1 percent above their year-earlier level.

The pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom slowed
somewhat in the fourth quarter of last year. The preliminary GDP
release showed growth of 2.1 percent (SAAR). Output of production
industries was estimated to have declined in the quarter, reflecting
weak manufacturing production and lower output of utilities

IV-17
industries owing to unseasonably warm weather. However, consumer
expenditure appears to have remained strong on average in the
quarter, despite a slight decline in the average volume of retail
sales in November and December. Total service sector output
increased about 4 percent (SAAR). Since November, business
sentiment has remained well below the average level earlier this
year, reflecting increased concern over both domestic and export
demand.

further in the fourth quarter. The claimant unemployment rate fell
to 5 percent in December. Based on the quarterly Labour Force
Survey, the LFS unemployment rate declined 0.5 percentage points to
6.6 percent over the September-November period, and LFS unemployment
fell to its lowest level since the series was introduced in 1984.
Average earnings growth picked up in both October and November.
primarily reflecting increased overtime and annual bonuses. Retail
prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.7 percent over
the year to December, remaining above the government's inflation
target of 2 1/2 percent for underlying inflation.

In Italy, GDP rose 1.8 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter.
Final domestic demand was relatively strong with both household
consumption and business investment contributing positively. Net
exports also contributed to third-quarter growth. Inventory
accumulation, which contributed over 7 percent to second-quarter
growth, slowed. Passthrough effects of the government's highly
successful auto-tax incentives continued to provide stimulus to
household consumption.

Available fourth-quarter indicators point to modest but
continuing growth. Industrial production rose in October and
November. Consumer confidence declined slightly below its third-
quarter average, but remained higher than its level in the second
quarter.
Italian inflation, which reached record low levels last year,
remains modest. In 1997, inflation was 1.8 percent on a year-over-
year basis, sharply below the 3.9 percent consumer price inflation
in 1996, and well below the official target of 2.5 percent. In
January, data from eleven Italian cities, which carry a cumulative
76 percent weight in the national index, point to a 1.5 percent
year-over-year increase in consumer prices.

On December 24, the Bank of Italy cut its official discount
and Lombard rates by 75 basis points each. Currently, the discount
rate stands at 5-1/2 percent and the Lombard rate at 7 percent.
Since July 1996, both the discount and the Lombard rates have been
lowered five times for a cumulative 350 basis points. The latest
cuts--widely expected by market participants--were announced a day
after preliminary data indicated lower-than-expected consumer price
inflation in December and on the day the government's 1998 budget
proposal passed through parliament.
On January 2, the Treasury Ministry announced that the 1997
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) was slightly below $30
billion equivalent, compared with a PSBR of $70 billion equivalent a
year ago. As a result, the 1997 budget deficit as a share of GDP is
now expected to be below the 3 percent Maastricht reference value--
less than half the 6.7 percent deficit in 1996.
Real GDP in Canada rose 4.1 percent (SAAR) in the third
quarter, following revised growth of 5.4 percent in the second
quarter. Consumption expenditures rose 5.3 percent, near the
average of the previous three quarters. Fixed investment surged,
led by investment in machinery and equipment. Government
expenditures rose slightly. Exports grew a solid 10.1 percent, but
imports increased a rapid 19.9 percent, due to strong domestic

IV-20
demand growth for goods with high import content, such as machinery
and equipment, industrial goods, and automotive products.

Canada recently has enjoyed declining unemployment and low
inflation. Unemployment--though still high--dropped from 9.0
percent in November to 8.6 percent in December, the first time below
9 percent since September 1990. Employment showed strong gains, led
by an expansion of full-time employment. Canadian consumer price
inflation (on a twelve-month basis) decelerated to 0.7 percent in
December, below the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent target range.
Contributing factors were moderation in auto price increases and a
decline in gasoline prices.
The Bank of Canada increased its key Bank Rate 50 basis
points, to 4.5 percent, on December 12, the fourth increase in the
Bank Rate since June but the first move of 50 basis points in more
than two years. The move was explicitly aimed at defending the
Canadian dollar, which had continued to weaken to near all-time lows
despite a previous rate hike on November 25. The Canadian currency
remained under pressure due to Canada's worsening external balances
and the belief that low inflation and relatively high unemployment
would keep the Bank of Canada from raising rates aggressively in the
near future. The Canadian dollar fell to an all-time low (below 69

IV-21
US cents) on January 22 following indications by Bank of Canada
officials that the Bank was not uncomfortable with the current level
of monetary conditions.

Canada's trade surplus fell to $0.3 billion in October (the
lowest level since December 1993) but rebounded a bit to $0.7
billion in November. Fallout from the Asian crisis showed through
in the weakness of Canadian exports, whose decline partly reflected
lower commodity prices (especially for primary metals and energy).
In addition, a decline in lumber exports was due largely to reduced
demand from Japan. The surge in Canadian imports was led by
investment goods (machinery and equipment, computer equipment,
aircraft), as Canadian firms continued their investment boom.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Financial turmoil has shown few signs of abating in the ASEAN
region and is reaching dangerous levels in Indonesia. In Korea,
major commercial bank creditors agreed in late December to a
voluntary arrangement to roll over claims on Korean banks, which
appears to have succeeded, at least temporarily, in halting a run on
Korea's banks. Negotiations on a debt-restructuring agreement began
on January 21.
Financial turmoil has led to a significant slowdown in growth
in Asia, with the exception of Taiwan. The slowdown is particularly
pronounced in the major ASEAN countries, but it appears that growth
began slowing in Korea in the fourth quarter, and also moderated in
China in the second half of the year. Growth performance was good
in major Latin American countries in the second half of 1997. with
the exception of Brazil.
External imbalances in the ASEAN region and Korea have
narrowed as a result of the fall in domestic demand and currency
depreciations. In China, surging exports contributed to the largest
trade surplus in its history in 1997.
Individual country and ASEAN notes. In Korea, there are
already signs of substantial macroeconomic adjustment. Real
activity appears to have decelerated markedly in November and
December, due to a severe credit squeeze and high degree of economic
uncertainty. The Bank of Korea (BOK) estimated on a preliminary
basis that the growth rate of industrial production slowed to under
four percent in December on a year-over-year basis.
Korea's current account appears to have achieved a rapid
turnaround into surplus, following substantial deficits during the
past two years. The recent improvement in the current account
reflects in part a large depreciation of the Korean won, reduced
credit availability, and slowing growth. The depreciation of the
won has translated into a sharp rise in import prices (which rose by
36 percent in December from their year-earlier level), and
substantial upward pressure on consumer prices.
The IMF program announced in early December failed initially
to restore market confidence. The international run on Korea's
banks continued to drain the BOK's reserves through the first three
weeks of December, and the won declined substantially. Following

IV-26
efforts by the IMF and U.S. authorities to "tighten" the original
program in late December, the major commercial bank creditors of
Korea agreed to a voluntary arrangement to roll over claims on
Korean banks. The rollover arrangement effectively imposed a
temporary standstill on payments to creditor banks while a long-term
solution to managing Korea's external obligations was formulated.

The arrangement has been broadly supported by the major
creditor banks of Korea, including banks in the United States,
Japan, Germany, and France. It appears to have succeeded in halting
the run on Korea's banks (at least temporarily). The BOK's reserves
stood at $11 billion on January 22, up from $4 billion at their low
on December 18.
On Wednesday January 21, a Korean delegation met in New York
with the major creditor commercial banks to begin negotiations on a
debt-restructuring agreement. The Koreans proposed to restructure a
substantial fraction of the short-term liabilities of Korean banks
into longer-term obligations that would be accompanied by a
sovereign guarantee.
Korea's President-Elect Kim Dae Jung has indicated strong
support for the IMF program since his election on December 18.
Despite his reputation as a populist, Kim supports legislation to
increase labor market flexibility, including provisions that would
make it easier for employers to lay off workers.
Korean authorities have moved swiftly to implement several key
reforms mandated in their IMF program. In particular, Korea's
National Assembly passed a financial sector reform bill on December
29 that grants independence to the BOK effective April 1;

IV-27
consolidates authority for regulating the financial sector into a
single regulatory agency; and requires corporations to file
consolidated accounting statements. The National Assembly also
passed legislation that will facilitate the effort to clean up the
banking sector by allowing the government to write down shareholder
equity when injecting capital into banks. The Korean authorities
also took important steps in December towards opening the capital
account by allowing foreign investors much greater access to Korean
stock and bond markets and by giving domestic corporations greater
ability to borrow funds abroad.
In the ASEAN region, the substantial increases in interest
rates since the onset of the crisis, along with the effects of the
currency depreciations and associated declines in investor
confidence, have slowed domestic demand growth considerably. In
Thailand, industrial production in October 1997 was 12 percent below
its year-earlier level. In Indonesia and the Philippines, anecdotal
reports suggest a substantial slowdown in economic activity in the
second half of 1997 from the pace in the first half of the year.

Inflation has been rising in some economies in the region,
driven in large part by the sharp depreciation of their currencies.
In Indonesia, inflation rose to over 11 percent by end-1997; a long
drought has exacerbated the inflationary pressure. Inflation also
picked up a bit in the Philippines and Thailand, but remains at low
levels in Malaysia and Singapore.

On January 15, Indonesian authorities announced that they have
reached agreement with the IMF on a "much strengthened and
reinforced" economic program. The major improvement over the
previous program--which had been announced on November 5--is that
President Suharto has promised "to take personal responsibility for
the quick and full implementation of the program." The four major
elements of the program are: (1) a tight monetary policy; (2)
fiscal measures; (3) structural reforms; and (4) bank and corporate
sector restructuring.
The Indonesian authorities renewed their commitment to a tight
monetary policy until confidence in the currency is restored. Under
the new program, Bank Indonesia will be given greater autonomy to
conduct monetary policy and determine interest rates. On January 27,
Bank Indonesia raised the rates on its central bank certificates for
all maturities. The Indonesian authorities will improve fiscal

IV-29
performance by (i) phasing out most subsidies on energy; (ii)
improving fiscal transparency by bringing several off-budget funds
on to the budget; and (iii) limiting spending on infrastructure
projects and eliminating tax and credit breaks granted to the
national airplane projects and the national car project.
Additionally, distribution cartels will be broken up, trade in
agricultural products will be deregulated, and barriers to foreign
investment in palm oil plantations will be removed.
Despite these steps, the renewal of the market's confidence is
likely to depend heavily on the crucial fourth element of the
program, the plans to restore the health of the banking and
corporate sectors. On January 26, Indonesian authorities announced
reforms of the banking sector and a framework to handle the
renegotiation of corporate debt. The banking sector reforms consist
of two components: (1) a government guarantee to depositors and
creditors of locally incorporated banks, and (2) the creation of a
restructuring agency to handle problem institutions. The guarantee
is valid for both rupiah and foreign currency denominated loans (the
latter are payable in rupiah at current exchange rates), is to last
for about two years, and is to be followed by the introduction of a
deposit insurance scheme. Shareholders and subordinated debt are
excluded from the guarantee. The financial restructuring agency
will supervise and manage the restructuring process of problem
banks, and will also serve as the management agency for assets that
it acquires in the course of restructuring. The Indonesian
government will issue bonds to cover the costs of the restructuring.
The corporate debt framework includes a temporary freeze on
financial, non-trade debt servicing, during which time depositors
and creditors will be encouraged to arrange workouts. A steering
committee consisting of senior international bankers from the main
creditor countries is being set up, as is a contact committee of
borrowers. The framework will be set up and managed by the private
sector based on voluntary agreements between borrowers and lenders.
The scheme does not involve any government guarantee or financing.
In Thailand, authorities have continued to take steps to
improve the health of the financial sector. On January 24, the
central bank took control of a failing mid-sized commercial bank,
thereby increasing the pressure on other struggling banks to raise

IV-30
capital quickly. In the Philippines, the authorities announced
their intention to seek further assistance from multilateral sources
in their efforts to defuse the crisis.
In Hong Kong, concerns about the currency peg remain. As of
late January, the yield spread between Hong Kong government debt and
U.S. Treasuries remained 350 to 550 basis points at maturities up to
10 years (the longest maturity available), comparable to the spread
between Hong Kong interbank rates and LIBOR U.S. dollar rates. Hong
Kong's stock market, which fell 20 percent during 1997, has fallen
another 14 percent this year. Much of that decline occurred
following the failure of Peregrine. Hong Kong's largest independent
investment bank; press reports suggest concern about other,
generally small, securities companies as well.
Hong Kong authorities, as well as Chinese officials, continue
to stress Hong Kong's commitment to the fixed peg against the
dollar. Foreign exchange reserves were $93 billion at the end of
December, down about $4 billion from November. Hong Kong
authorities estimate that GDP grew about 5.0 in the third quarter of
1997 from the year-earlier period, compared with growth of 6.5
percent in the first half of 1997.
In China, output growth was about 8 percent in the second half
of 1997 from the year-earlier period, and the 8.8 percent growth
rate (year over year) for all of 1997 was the lowest rate of growth
since 1991. Inflation remained close to zero. Exports surged 20
percent in 1997 from a year earlier, contributing to the widest
trade surplus in China's history; imports rose about 3 percent.
So far, China has remained relatively unaffected by the
current financial crisis in Asia. China's exchange rate has
remained stable against the U.S. dollar, and the price of domestic
shares (which comprise 95 percent of China's stock market, and which
foreigners cannot purchase) remain 30 percent higher than they were
last July. Foreign-exchange reserves have risen steadily, reaching
$140 billion at the end of 1997, up $33 billion for the year.
China's currency is not convertible on the capital account,
making a speculative attack difficult. Chinese authorities had
previously expressed a goal of moving towards capital account
convertibility, but in mid-January announced that, in response to
events in Asia, they were postponing any such plans.

In addition, China announced plans to accelerate reforms of
the financial system, including a reorganization of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank. to make its structure more similar
to that of the Federal Reserve system. In particular, in order to
reduce interference by local authorities, the reforms would
eliminate many of the local and provincial branches, creating 10
regional headquarters that cut across provincial lines. Other
reforms include increased efforts to improve the quality of bank
assets by closing unprofitable branches of the state-owned
commercial banks, and substantially increasing state allocations to
write off non-performing loans. According to Chinese officials,
more than 20 percent of bank loans are non-performing, although only
5 to 6 percent of loans are unrecoverable. However, western bankers
often estimate that the proportion of non-performing and
unrecoverable loans may be much higher.
In Taiwan, industrial production surged in the fourth quarter,
while consumer prices have remained relatively flat. Very
preliminary government statistics suggest that in the fourth
quarter, GDP growth was about 6.7 percent. If these statistics are
accurate, the staff estimates that at a seasonally-adjusted annual
rate, growth was around 8 percent in the third and fourth quarters.
Taiwan's trade surplus narrowed substantially in 1997, as exports
rose 5 percent from 1996 and imports rose 12 percent.
The Taiwan dollar depreciated about 5 percent against the U.S.
dollar in early January, following declines in other Asian
currencies. The stock market ended 1997 up 18 percent for the year,
although it was 20 percent below its mid-summer peak. As of January
28, the market was down 1 percent for the year. At the end of
November, international reserves were $83 billion, essentially

IV-32
unchanged from a month earlier, and down $7 billion from their
recent peak in June.

Industrial production plunged in November in the wake of the
doubling of interest rates at the end of October from 20 to 40
percent. Inflation ended the year at 4.3 percent (December-over-

The sharp decline in demand contributed to a narrowing in the
trade deficit in December to $0.8 billion, down considerably from
the deficit of $1.8 billion in the year-earlier period. The current
account deficit for 1997 stood at $33.8 billion, about 4 percent of
GDP. International reserves totalled about $52 billion (liquidity
concept), down $8 billion from a year ago. In the capital account,
direct foreign investment rose from $10 billion in 1996 to $17
billion in 1997, owing in part to privatizations at the federal and

IV-33
state levels. Other net capital inflows declined from $22 billion
in 1996 to $8 billion in 1997, largely reflecting an outflow of
short-term capital.
So far. Brazilian authorities have maintained that they will
not succumb to pressures to devalue the "real" and will keep
interest rates high. The "real"/dollar exchange rate has continued
to depreciate slowly within a narrow crawling band (the so-called
"mini-band") that is realigned about 0.6 percent each month. This
narrow band moves within a wider band (the so-called "maxi-band)
that has been realigned about once a year. On January 21, about a
month before markets expected, the central bank realigned the "maxi"
band, but the implied maximum-allowable depreciation over the next
year is in keeping with the current policy of a 7 percent annual
depreciation of the "real"/dollar exchange rate. Therefore,
financial markets interpreted the move as a continuation of the
existing policy.
The Cardoso administration has also continued its efforts at
tackling Brazil's serious fiscal problems. In January, Congress
convened an emergency session to consider constitutional reforms
that are thought to be crucial for fiscal stability.
In Argentina, economic activity continues to be quite strong.
Compared with the year-earlier period, industrial production rose
almost 9 percent in November while real GDP grew more than 8 1/2
percent in the third quarter of 1997. Moreover, the unemployment
rate fell to 13.7 percent in the October 1997 survey, down almost 5
percentage points from its peak in mid-1995. Despite the decline in
unemployment, inflation remains virtually non-existent. Strong
growth led to a trade deficit of $2.5 billion through November of
1997, compared with a surplus of over $2 billion over the same
period in 1996.
To date, the turmoil in Asia has not created any undue
pressures on either convertibility or the banking sector, although
the blue-chip Merval stock index has declined roughly 25 percent
since the Asian crisis intensified in late October. The real
interest rate (measured using observed monthly inflation) on 30-day
peso-denominated deposits rose over 500 basis points to almost 12
percent in November, but has been declining since then.

International reserves (excluding gold) stood at over $21
billion at the end of December, up roughly 7 percent from November.
Deposits, which currently stand at nearly $70 billion and have more
than doubled since the end of the banking crisis in 1995, have not
shown any substantial declines following the Asian crisis. The
fiscal deficit (excluding privatization revenues) declined from $4.9
billion in 1996 (1.6 percent of GDP) to $2.9 billion in 1997
(1 percent of GDP), meeting the 1997 IMF target of $3 billion.
In Mexico, economic activity remains strong, and unemployment
has continued to decline. Industrial production remains robust, and
unemployment declined to 2.8 percent at the end of 1997. Consumer
price inflation has remained subdued. In the twelve months to
December 1997, consumer prices rose 16 percent, well below the
inflation rate of 28 percent registered in 1996. In December, the
trade deficit was $0.7 billion; for all of 1997, Mexico had a small
trade surplus of $0.6 billion, down from a surplus of $6.5 billion
in 1996. The recovery of the economy and the real appreciation of
the peso have contributed to faster growth of imports than exports.
On December 15, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz was nominated
by President Zedillo, and approved by the senate, to head the Bank
of Mexico. Ortiz replaces Miguel Mancera, whose 15-year tenure
ended last month with his retirement. On January 5, Foreign
Minister Jose Angel Gurria was named as the new Finance Minister;
prior to being Foreign Minister, Gurria held various high-ranking

IV-35
economics posts. Economic policies under this new team are expected
to remain essentially unchanged.

In mid-December, the Mexican congress passed the budget,
ending a stalemate that had threatened to shut down the government.
This budget does not include the main tax cuts the opposition
wanted, including a reduction of Mexico's value-added tax to 12
percent from 15 percent, and is unlikely to raise the fiscal deficit
by much above the administration's initial target of 1.25 percent of
GDP. In January, the Mexican authorities announced additional
spending cuts to offset an expected decline in revenues of 0.4
percentage points of GDP: the cuts are expected to come in both
current spending and investment. The authorities expect that the
estimated budget deficit of 1.25 percent of GDP for 1998 fiscal year
will remain unchanged.
Mexican financial markets continue to be affected by the Asian
crisis. The peso value of the dollar, which opened the year at 8.1,
fell to the 8.2-8.3 range in the second week of January, and has
remained volatile. At the most recent Treasury auction 28-day
interest rates were 17.4 percent, below their mid-December rates but
above their mid-October level.
In Venezuela, the recent pick-up in economic activity
continues. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent in the fourth

IV-36
quarter of 1997, compared with 12.4 percent in the same period of
1996. The recovery has led to a widening of external balances; the
non-oil trade deficit moved to roughly $6 billion in the period from
January to October last year compared with around $4 billion in the
same months of 1996. Inflation picked up last year:
December/December consumer price inflation for 1997 was 38 percent,
compared with the original target of 25 percent agreed upon with the
IMF.

The recent decline in oil prices is likely to create fiscal
problems for the government this year, and has led to a fall in
international reserves which, excluding gold, stood at just under
$14 billion at the end of December, down 10 percent from November.
The stock market has suffered due to the decline in oil prices
coupled with the effects of the Asian crisis.
Responding to concerns that the Venezuelan currency is
overvalued, Venezuela's Central Bank in January reset the central
rate of its currency band system and accelerated the rate at which
the bands depreciate from 1.16 to 1.28 percent per month. In an
attempt to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation, the central
bank also increased the discount rate to 60 percent from 45 percent,
effective immediately.
In Russia, recent data confirm the favorable macroeconomic
trends of 1997. Real GDP showed a 12-month increase of 1.2 percent
in December, and for 1997 as a whole edged up 0.4 percent, its first
yearly rise since 1990. Industrial production was up 4.2 percent in
the 12 months to December. The 12-month consumer price inflation

IV-37
rate continued to edge down in December, and at 11.1 percent was
substantially below the 21.8 percent rate of the previous December.
Consistent with an environment of less inflation, the government
introduced a redenominated ruble at the start of the year, equal to
1,000 old rubles; the introduction of the new ruble appears to have
gone smoothly. The government's draft budget calls for real GDP
growth of 2 percent and inflation of below 6 percent in 1998.

The severe downward pressure on the ruble which had developed
in November eased in December after the central bank signaled its
willingness to raise interest rates substantially to defend the
currency. Foreign exchange reserves showed no net decline during
December, remaining at $18 billion, following a $5 billion decline
in November. Russian financial markets have continued, however, to
remain vulnerable to occasional bouts of pressure resulting from
spillovers from the Asian financial crisis or adverse reports about
President Yeltsin's health.
On January 8, the IMF approved the release of $800 million to
Russia that had been held up since September because of concerns
over the government's ability to collect taxes and meet its promised
budget targets.
