DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Consumption, housing, and business equipment spending appear to
have advanced briskly this quarter. Were it not for the likelihood
that net exports and inventory investment have dropped off from
their fourth-quarter rates, we would be anticipating real GDP growth
at least as strong as that seen in 1997. Indeed, growth in
production worker hours in January and February was more robust than
over the four quarters of last year. The pressures on labor
supplies have forced many employers to offer workers higher pay or
other inducements. But, thanks in large measure to a glut of oil
this winter, price inflation has been almost negligible of late.
Labor Market Developments
Payroll employment gains averaged more than 340,000 in the
first two months of 1998. Construction jobs continued to rise
rapidly--even faster than in the fourth quarter. In addition to the
strong fundamentals in this sector, unseasonably warm weather in
much of the country and the need to repair damage from ice storms
and heavy rains appear to have provided some extra lift to
employment. This should reduce the amount of additional hiring this
spring, when the seasonal step-up in construction typically takes
place. Service-producing industries continued to post major job
gains in January and February. In manufacturing, however,
employment increases averaged 20.000 per month, off from double that
pace in the fourth quarter.
With two months of strong growth in payroll employment and
further increases in the workweek, aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls in February were
estimated by BLS to have been 1.6 percent (not at an annual rate)
above their fourth-quarter average. Reporting problems associated
with variations in the number of workdays in the month appear to
have biased the published quarterly pattern of hours
significantly.1 Even adjusting for these problems, the February
level of aggregate hours still would be 1.1 percent above its
1. The BLS adjusts for monthly variations in the number of
workdays in a pay period for employees paid on a monthly or semi-
monthly basis. However, some firms have been reporting hours (and
payrolls) for such employees as though each month were of a
"typical" length. This reporting problem, which dates back to 1988,
has led to an overstatement of hours in months with fewer workdays
and an understatement in months with more workdays. In June, the
BLS will correct these reporting problems and will revise the hours
data back to 1988 accordingly.

fourth-quarter average, putting hours on track to grow at least as
fast in the first quarter as they did in the fourth quarter (on an
adjusted basis).2
The household survey also portrayed a robust labor market in
early 1998. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.6 percent in
February, and the participation rate rose to a record 67.3 percent
in January and held at that level in February. Since the first
quarter of 1997, the participation rate has risen 0.2 percentage
point, with about half of the increase reflecting a further rise in
participation among adult women who maintain families--an obvious
group to be affected by strong labor markets and welfare reform.
With the January data, the BLS introduced new composite
estimation procedures intended to reduce the variance in household
employment. The new method has very little effect on estimates of
the unemployment rate, but it results in somewhat lower estimates of
employment, the civilian labor force, and the participation rate.
Had these new procedures been in place in 1997, we estimate that the
participation rate would have differed little from the published
figures in the first half of the year but would have been nearly
1/4 percentage point lower in the second half. This correction does
not affect the 0.2 percentage point rise in the participation rate
over the past year.
Among other indicators, initial claims for unemployment
insurance have remained in the very low range of 300,000 to 320,000.
The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey index of expectations for net
hiring in the second quarter of 1998 edged down from the first
quarter but remained in the high range that has prevailed over the
past year. The various surveys of companies' hiring experiences
are all reporting tightness in the labor market. In addition, the
index of the expected change in unemployment in the preliminary
Michigan SRC consumer survey for March remained at one of its most
optimistic readings.
2. The BLS will implement the annual benchmark revision to
nonfarm payroll employment in early June with the release of the May
employment data. The March 1997 level of employment will be revised
up 431,000 (or 0.4 percent), with the increase wedged into the data
beginning April 1996. The level of hours in the nonfarm business
sector is likely to be revised up roughly 0.3 percent, and
productivity, all else equal, can be expected to be revised downward
by a similar amount.
3. Although the survey refers to the second quarter, experience
suggests that it is better interpreted as an indicator of employment
growth in the current (first) quarter.

The strong gains in employment and the workweek in the fourth
quarter of 1997 were accompanied by an increase in output per hour
in the nonfarm business sector of 1.6 percent at an annual rate.
The reporting problems in measuring the workweek mentioned above
probably caused published productivity growth in the fourth quarter
to be understated by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point, and we
expect published productivity growth in the first quarter of 1998 to
be understated by a similar amount. Over the four quarters of 1997,
productivity rose 2.1 percent; this figure probably was not greatly
affected by the workweek measurement problems.
Industrial Production
After growing at a torrid pace in the second half of last year.
industrial production decelerated noticeably over the first two
months of this quarter. In part, the slowdown reflected the effects
of the unusually warm weather on utilities output. But signs of a
tapering were also apparent in manufacturing, where output rose only
0.3 percent in January and was unchanged in February--trimming the
factory operating rate to its long-term average of 81-3/4 percent.
To some extent, the recent deceleration in manufacturing
production reflects developments in the motor vehicle sector, where
output had been boosted in late 1997 by the make-up of assembly
shortfalls that occurred last spring and summer due to strikes and
plant startup problems. With the adjustment apparently complete,
assemblies fell back to a 12.4 million unit annual rate in January
and to 12 million units in February, reducing industrial production
growth 0.1 percentage point in each month. While inventories are

high for a few models of light vehicles, days' supply, on balance,
is well aligned with demand. Looking ahead, the scheduled assembly
pace for March through June averages just a bit above 12 million
units--consistent with light vehicle sales remaining in the vicinity
of 15 million units, where they have been for several years now.
The output of business equipment excluding motor vehicles and
parts has also slowed after having risen rapidly in 1997: It fell
0.6 percent in January and was little changed in February.
Production of industrial, communications, and photographic equipment
has been weak, and aircraft assemblies have flattened out as Boeing4nears completion of its ramp-up. As for other final products,
the production of non-automotive consumer goods has slowed a bit
recently after a fourth-quarter spurt, while the strength in the
building sector has continued to lift output of construction
supplies. The production of non-automotive materials edged up
0.2 percent in February after having increased just 0.1 percent in
January--well off the pace set last year.
Leading indicators of industrial production point to growth
over the next few months. On a three-month moving average basis,
the staff's estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders advanced
about 1 percent in February. The new orders index from the NAPM
also has turned up in recent months, while the new orders index from
the Dun and Bradstreet Manufacturing Survey remains at a high level.
While overall orders remain positive, reports from
manufacturers indicate that export orders from Asia are declining.
In addition, the diffusion index for export orders in the NAPM
survey was modestly negative in both January and February--the first
consecutive negative readings since the question was introduced in
1988. The role of the Asia crisis in explaining the slowing in
industrial output over the past couple of months is unclear:
Although production in industries that export an above-average share
of their output to Asian countries has slowed recently, output in
4. However, shortages of parts and modifications demanded by U.S.
and European safety regulators are forcing Boeing to postpone
deliveries of aircraft that are largely completed.

industries that export less heavily to Asia also has decelerated
(chart).5
Finally, we estimate that manufacturing capacity will grow
5.4 percent in 1998.6 This preliminary estimate suggests that
appreciable gains in industrial demand can be accommodated without
straining productive facilities.
Personal Income and Consumption
Consumer spending surged in early 1998. The factors that
fueled the robust increase in consumption last year have, if
anything, become more positive in recent months: Growth in real
disposable personal income has been very strong; households have
continued to enjoy extraordinary gains in net worth; and consumer
sentiment has reached new highs.
In February, nominal sales in the retail control category,
which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and
supply stores, rose 0.6 percent following an upward-revised gain of
more than 1 percent in January. (The gain in January had originally
been reported as 0.4 percent.) Sales were especially strong at
apparel and general merchandise stores and at stores selling "other
durable goods," which include jewelry, books, and sporting goods.
Based on the February retail sales and consumer price reports, we
estimate that real personal consumption expenditures for goods other
than motor vehicles rose 1.4 percent in January and 0.6 percent in
February.
Adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, sales of light motor
vehicles averaged 15 million units at an annual rate in January and
February. This pace has been sustained in part by more attractive
selling terms, including cut-rate finance charges and relatively
generous price incentives. In recent weeks, General Motors has
boosted its incentives to counter the richer packages offered by
5. Industries with above-average Asian trade shares are leather,
electrical machinery, industrial machinery and computing equipment,
miscellaneous manufacturing, instruments, apparel, chemicals,
fabricated metals, and rubber. Industries with below-average Asian
trade shares are lumber, primary metals, tobacco, paper, textiles,
furniture, food, petroleum, printing and publishing, and stone,
clay, and glass.
6. The 1998 capacity estimate is based on estimates of the
growth of manufacturers' capital input and available measures of
capacity in physical volume terms for selected industries, such as
steel, aluminum, selected chemicals, and motor vehicles. Capital
input is derived from the most recent information on manufacturers'
capital spending plans from NAPM and from data on contracts and
orders for industrial plant and equipment, which suggest that the
level of manufacturing investment continues to be high.

Ford and Chrysler, and Toyota announced modest incentives on the
Camry and Corolla models--two of its leading sellers.
Real expenditures on services rose only 0.2 percent in January
as warmer-than-average temperatures reduced energy consumption
sharply. In February, real outlays for electricity and natural gas
likely rose: According to data from the National Weather Service,
February also was warmer than average, but temperatures were closer
to seasonal norms than they were in January. In March, temperatures
thus far have been colder than average, suggesting another increase
in energy outlays this month.
Data on personal income are available through January, when
total nominal income increased 0.6 percent. Disposable personal
income rose faster than total income in January--up 0.8 percent in
nominal terms and 0.7 percent in real terms. DPI growth was boosted
in January by a federal pay increase for civilian workers,
cost-of-living adjustments to several federal transfer programs, and
the annual adjustment of tax withholding schedules for
inflation. Although such changes occur at the same time every
year, the BEA does not seasonally adjust them, which distorts income
growth each January. In addition, personal tax payments were
reduced in January by the tax changes legislated last year (for
example, the child tax credit). All told, these factors boosted DPI
growth in January by about $20 billion, or 0.3 percentage point.
According to the latest published data, the saving rate rose to
4.2 percent in January; however, these data do not reflect the huge
upward revision to January consumer spending, which, all else equal,
would push the saving rate 0.2 percentage point below the published
number. Turning to February, income growth likely remained strong,
reflecting the increases in production worker hours and wages
reported in the February employment release.
According to the preliminary report of the Michigan Survey
Research Center, the index of consumer confidence fell back in early
March after a surge in February. Nonetheless, consumer confidence,
7. These factors were offset somewhat by a boost to personal
contributions for social insurance (an item subtracted from personal
income) due to an increase in the taxable wage base for social
security.
8. As discussed in the earlier section on labor markets, the
increase in the workweek in February was biased upward. However,
the bias in the workweek should not affect monthly estimates of wage
and salary income generated by the BEA. Analysts at the BEA
routinely adjust the BLS data to produce an estimate of the average
workweek that they believe is more appropriate for the entire month.

Housing Markets
Housing activity has strengthened in recent months, spurred by
further gains in employment, income, and wealth as well as by the
drop in fixed mortgage rates. Single-family housing starts were at
an annual rate of 1.27 million units in February, up from January's
1.22 million unit pace; the average for these two months was more
than 9 percent above the fourth-quarter average. Adjusted permits
for single-family units, which we view as a better indicator of
underlying activity, rose close to 1 percent in February and have
been on a solid uptrend since last September. Moreover, despite
the strong readings on starts in recent months, the backlog of
unused permits, which has some utility as a forward indicator for
starts, has edged up since November.
The effects of unseasonable weather on starts can be quite
pronounced during the winter months, and they are difficult to pin
down this year. For the nation as a whole, temperatures were well
above average in January and February--a clear plus for builders--
but precipitation, which tends to slow construction, has been
unusually heavy since November. Our best guess is that, on balance,
starts were boosted to some extent by this winter's weather, but
that much of the strength in the single-family sector so far this
year is attributable to strong fundamentals.
Indeed, indicators that are less affected by weather than
starts all point to a brisk pace of housing demand. The thirty-
year, fixed-mortgage rate, which averaged 7.9 percent in the first
half of 1997, fell sharply in the second half of last year and has
averaged just a shade over 7 percent so far this year. Partly in
response to the decline in long-term interest rates, mortgage
applications--both for home purchase and refinancing--surged to
record levels, and home sales responded accordingly. Sales of
existing houses in February were at a record-setting 4.75 million
unit annual rate, up sharply further from the strong January
reading. New home sales in January came in just shy of 880,000
units, about equaling the record posted in 1986. More timely
indicators have also shown continued strength. Builders' ratings of
both current and expected new home sales, which have climbed

permit-issuing places and a correction for units started within
permit-issuing places for which permits were not issued.

steadily during the past year or so, edged up further in March.
Consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions this month were
upbeat. Finally, although mortgage applications for home purchase
have receded in recent weeks, they are still at a very high level.
Multifamily starts were at a 366,000 unit annual rate in
February. During the first two months of this year, these starts
averaged 346,000 units, down noticeably from the 390,000 unit pace
posted in the fourth quarter of last year and only a touch above
their 1997 average. Although the fundamentals for this sector--such
as rents and vacancy rates--have improved during the past year or
two, they do not suggest that rental markets have tightened
appreciably. As a result, the drop in construction of these units
during the first two months of this year was not surprising.
Business Fixed Investment
Available indicators suggest that real business fixed
investment--which declined in the fourth quarter--will rise briskly
in the current quarter. Although the spending indicators for
nonresidential structures have been surprisingly lackluster, the
combination of rebounding shipments and plummeting computer prices
points to a sizable gain in real equipment outlays.
A huge increase in real outlays for office and computing
equipment appears to be under way this quarter: Nominal shipments
surged 9 percent in December and tacked on further increases of
2 and 3 percent in January and February respectively. Meanwhile,
the producer price index for computing equipment fell nearly
10 percent over the first two months of 1998. In part, the plunge
in prices reflects heightened competition at the low end of the
microprocessor market, which has contributed to the boom of sales of
low-end PCs. Also important, manufacturers are offering significant
discounts to clear out inventories of a broad range of computers.
In some cases, they are cutting prices to facilitate a shift to the
build-to-order practices used by Dell, which holds inventories equal
to only one week's sales. In addition, many producers of high-end
servers and workstations apparently did not move quickly enough to
match the steep cuts at the lower end of the market and are now
slashing prices to clear out their distribution channels.
The outlook for communications equipment has also improved.
After having declined in the fourth quarter, shipments and orders
for communications equipment rose substantially, on average, in
January and February. More generally, widening use of the Internet,

upgrading of cable systems, and long-distance telephone companies'
plans for entering local phone markets suggest the potential for
further healthy gains in expenditures in this category this year.
Transportation equipment expenditures are likely to hold down
business investment in the first quarter. The drag comes mostly
from the aircraft industry. As noted, production has flattened out,
and our sources indicate that a very high percentage of this
quarter's output will be exported, implying that domestic
expenditures on aircraft are likely to fall.
Recent indicators for spending on equipment outside of the
high-tech and transportation sectors have been mixed. Shipments
have edged up, on balance, so far this year, but orders have bounced
around and their three-month moving average has dropped back from
the very high readings in the second half of 1997. Nonetheless,
lagged accelerator effects should remain a plus for growth in
expenditures over the coming months.
The evidence on nonresidential construction activity continues
to be puzzling. The fundamentals in some key segments appear very
strong, and anecdotal reports seem quite upbeat. Vacancy rates are
continuing to decline, and real estate prices are accelerating:
According to the National Real Estate Index, prices for both office
and retail buildings rose 8 percent over the year ended in 1997:Q3
(the latest available data), up from a 4 percent rise for office
buildings and a 1-1/2 percent increase for retail buildings over the
year-earlier period. However, nominal private nonresidential
building construction has not changed much, on balance, since last
summer. Private construction contracts rose 21 percent in February,
reversing their January plunge, but, on a six-month moving average
basis, they remained almost 6 percent below last September's peak.
Taken together, these data suggest limited potential for expansion
in real outlays on nonresidential structures in the first
10quarter.
The surprising lack of strength in nonresidential construction
activity might be due to problems with the source data for the
official estimates. When choosing a sample of construction projects
on which to base its estimates of construction put-in-place, the
10. Another factor that will hold down measured growth in
investment in nonresidential structures in the first quarter is the
federal government's sale to the private sector of the Elk Hills
energy facility, a one-time transaction that boosted real
nonresidential structures (and depressed real federal expenditures)
by $3 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.

Census Bureau uses F.W. Dodge's data on construction contracts.
Recently, Dodge altered its data collection methodology, moving
toward electronic reporting, while Census changed its sample
construction technique. These changes arouse suspicions, but they
do not clearly point to a downward bias in the construction put-in-
place data.
Business Inventories
In book-value terms, business inventories excluding motor
vehicles rose at an $18 billion annual rate in January, after an
accumulation of $43 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997. For most
manufacturing and trade groupings, inventory-sales ratios in January
were near the middle of their recent ranges. On the whole, business
inventories appear to be at comfortable levels.
Manufacturers' stocks excluding aircraft and parts rose
$14 billion in January, about the same as in the fourth quarter.
Among sectors that export heavily to Asia, the pace of stockbuilding
picked up a bit at producers of electrical machinery, but stocks
rose only moderately at producers of instruments, and inventories in
the nonelectrical machinery sector declined, reflecting a large drop
in stocks held by office and computing manufacturers.
Refiners' inventories fell sharply further in January, probably
reflecting the steep reduction in oil prices. 11 However, nominal
shipments of petroleum declined even more, and the inventory-
shipments ratio for this sector remained at the high end of the past
year's range.
Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles fell $18 billion
at an annual rate in January. The drop was in stocks of nondurable
goods and largely reflected a return of farm products inventories to
more normal levels and a sharp drop in tobacco stocks (on a not
seasonally adjusted basis).
Inventories at non-auto retailers rose at nearly a $20 billion
annual rate in January. This increase came on the heels of a
similar-sized buildup in December, though the stockbuilding in
January was more evenly spread across categories. Retail sales were
also very strong in January, and the inventory-sales ratio edged
down toward the lower end of the range that has prevailed over the
past year.
11. Physical product data available from the Department of Energy
suggest that real stocks at refiners rose in January. However,
particularly because these data are not published on a seasonally
adjusted basis, aligning them with the Census data can be difficult.

Federal Sector
The incoming news on the federal budget has remained very
favorable. Bolstered by continued strong revenue growth, the budget
showed a small surplus over the twelve months ending in February,
and a surplus for fiscal 1998 is looking increasingly likely.
Indeed, in early March, the Congressional Budget Office released
updated estimates that showed a surplus of $8 billion for fiscal
1998; in January, the CBO had projected a deficit of $5 billion.12
According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, receipts in
January and February were 8 percent above a year earlier.
Individual income and payroll taxes rose 9 percent; by comparison,
personal income rose 6 percent over the twelve months ended in
January. Rising liabilities owing to bonuses, capital gains
realizations, and real bracket creep appear to have more than offset
the downward pressures on receipts from legislated tax reductions
that are now kicking in. Personal income tax refunds--including the
portion of the earned income tax credit that is scored as an outlay
for income security--were 13 percent higher in January and February
than in the same months of 1997. The surge in refunds largely
reflects faster processing by the IRS owing to increased use of
electronic filing. The amount of the average refund rose only
3 percent to about $1400.
Outlays grew slowly in January and February. Contributors
included the effects of declining inflation on the social security
COLA and many other transfer payments, slower growth of net federal
debt and thus debt service payments, a decline in the use of low-
income support programs, and the phase-in of cuts made to Medicare
last year. In addition, nominal defense outlays, adjusted for
payment timing shifts, fell about 4 percent in January and February
from the same period last year. Taking a longer perspective,
defense expenditures have been moving sideways over the past two
years.
State and Local Governments
Recent indicators of spending by state and local governments
have been mixed. Growth in employment averaged 25,000 in the first
two months of the year, well ahead of the fourth-quarter pace but
12. The Administration's latest official estimate is for a $10
billion deficit in fiscal 1998. However, this estimate was released
in early February and did not reflect the strength in revenues over
the past few months. A discussion of the proposals in the
President's budget for fiscal 1999 and the outlook for the budget
over the next several years is provided in the appendix.

about matching the average rise during all of 1997. Real
construction spending in January was about 1 percent below the
fourth-quarter average.
Most states are currently in the process of preparing their
fiscal 1999 budgets. With robust revenue growth, ending balances in
state general funds are at their highest levels as a percentage of
expenditures since 1980, and governors in almost half the states are
proposing tax cuts. However, according to the National Conference
of State Legislatures, this year's tax changes are unlikely to be
much bigger than the small to medium-sized reductions seen in recent
years. Once again, the emphasis is expected to be on cuts in
personal income taxes. Some states are also considering
facilitating reductions in property taxes, which are primarily local
taxes, by increasing state grants to localities for K-12 school
13programs.
Local governments also appear to be doing well. According to a
1997 survey by the National League of Cities, more than two-thirds
of cities were better off financially in fiscal 1997 than in the
previous year; that percentage has been rising for five years.
Local governments whose revenues come in large part from income
taxes and state grants seem to be better-off than those more
dependent on property taxes.
Prices
The consumer price index was unchanged in January and edged up
only 0.1 percent in February, as large declines in energy prices
nearly offset increases elsewhere.14 Over the twelve months
ending in February, the CPI rose only 1.4 percent, the smallest
twelve-month increase since December 1986. (The oil-induced low in
CPI inflation that year was 1.1 percent.)
The CPI for energy has dropped considerably since late 1997,
mainly reflecting the slump in crude oil prices. After averaging
more than $21 per barrel in October, the spot price of West Texas
intermediate fell substantially through mid-March before rebounding
13. In addition, some states (New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and
Connecticut) are hoping to squirrel funds away for a rainy day or
reduce outstanding debt (Rhode Island). And legislators in other
states are proposing to use surpluses for infrastructure projects
(Colorado and Minnesota) or other short-term spending programs.
14. In January, the BLS introduced major revisions to the CPI,
which included updated expenditure weights (to the 1993-95 period),
new geographic sample and population weights, new categories of
goods sampled, and an improved quality-adjustment procedure for
computer prices.

somewhat in recent days. It now stands at around $15-1/2 per
barrel. As a result of the decline in crude oil prices, gasoline
and heating oil prices plunged in January and February, and private
survey data suggest that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the retail
price of gasoline dropped further in March. The indexes for natural
gas and electricity have declined as well, as warmer-than-usual
weather weakened demand. Electricity prices were also depressed by
legislated price cuts in January associated with the initial stages
of deregulation in California and a rebate in February to California
customers for the lower-than-expected fuel input costs by utilities
in 1997.15
The CPI for food rose 0.3 percent in January but was unchanged
in February. The price index for fruits and vegetables fell back
somewhat last month after having risen sharply in January.
Excluding fruits and vegetables, food prices were up 0.1 percent in
the latest month, the same as in each of the previous two months.
El Niño probably has played a role in the recent volatility of fresh
produce prices, with flooding having temporarily disrupted field
operations in both the West and the South. More generally, though,
El Niño's effects are less clear, as the mild winter has spared
agriculture from many of the normal adversities of the winter
season. Livestock operations, for example, were less strained than
usual by the winter this year, and production has thereby been
increased--perhaps more so than producers might have wished, given
the degree to which livestock prices were pushed down in the first
two months of the year. Meanwhile, crop prices have not achieved
their customary seasonal gains so far this year, partly because of
concerns that the problems in Asia will limit exports. Reflecting
these developments, the PPI for crude foods--an index that includes
both crops and livestock--fell 4 percent over the first two months
of 1997 to a level more than 5 percent below that of a year earlier.
And, futures prices for farm commodities have weakened, on balance,
since the January Greenbook.
For items other than food and energy, consumer prices rose
0.2 percent in January and 0.3 percent in February. On a twelve-
month basis, core consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in February, down
15. On January 1, residential electricity rates in California were
cut 10 percent. On March 31, users will have the option of buying
electricity from alternative providers, which may lead to further
price reductions over time. However, at least in the near term,
additional savings will more likely be realized by industrial rather
than residential consumers.

slightly from the 2.5 percent pace recorded a year earlier but up a
touch from the pace recorded in the previous couple of months. Core
services prices advanced 3.1 percent over the past twelve months--
about the same as over the preceding year. Falling import prices
likely were a factor helping to hold the rate-of change of core CPI
commodities to 0.4 percent over the year ending in February. Prices
of new vehicles, which have been restrained by the strong dollar and
competition for market share, were unchanged on balance in the first
two months of this year after having declined in 1997. And while
used car and truck prices have moved up in the past three months,
they remain 4 percent below their year-earlier level. Apparel
prices, while volatile on a month-to-month basis, were down on
balance in January and February and unchanged from a year ago after
having risen somewhat in the previous twelve-month period. In
contrast, tobacco prices have accelerated sharply; the index's
10 percent increase over the past year reflects three large
wholesale price hikes and a number of hefty increases in state
excise taxes.
Broad measures of prices in the NIPA decelerated last year.
For example, the chain price indexes for GDP and for PCE excluding
food and energy rose 1/2 and 3/4 percentage point less over the
four quarters of 1997 than they did during 1996. As with the CPI,
the chain price index for core PCE was held down in 1997 by a
decline in durable goods prices and a deceleration in services other
than energy and housing.
Prices of capital equipment in the PPI edged down 0.1 percent
in both January and February, reflecting further declines for motor
vehicles and a very large drop in computer prices. In contrast,
reports of price pressures in trucking and rail transportation have
begun to surface recently. The PPI for railroad transportation was
up 1.1 percent in the twelve months ending in February, the largest
increase since May 1994. The PPI for trucking and courier services
also moved up in the first two months of this year, although the
twelve-month change in the index--2.3 percent--was still
1/4 percentage point below the twelve-month change last February.
Prices at earlier stages of processing remain quiescent. The
PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy edged down
0.1 percent in both January and February, and the index in February
was unchanged from its level a year earlier. The PPI for core crude
materials fell 2.2 percent in January but edged up in February, the

first increase in six months. Since the mid-February pricing date
for the PPI, the Journal of Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price
indexes have ticked up, on balance, but remain below their levels at
the end of last year.
After having dropped in 1997, short-term inflation expectations
have fallen further this year. As measured by the Michigan SRC
index, one-year-ahead inflation expectations--both the mean and the
median--fell about 1/2 percentage point in the first quarter.
Longer-term inflation expectations, measured by either the
Philadelphia Fed's survey of professional forecasters or the
Michigan survey, edged down in the first quarter.
Subdued price inflation and declining inflation expectations
notwithstanding, the BLS's Productivity and Cost report shows that
compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a
5.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Over
the four quarters of 1997, compensation per hour grew 4.1 percent,
up about a quarter point from the rate recorded in 1996. The
Employment Cost Index for compensation--which controls for
occupational and industry mix shifts but excludes some forms of
remuneration such as stock options and sign-on bonuses--rose
3.4 percent last year, also about 1/4 percentage point faster than
the increase recorded in 1996.
Despite the acceleration in compensation in 1997, the pickup in
productivity growth last year limited the increase in unit labor
costs to 1.9 percent. Even so, the rise in unit labor costs was
about 1/2 percentage point greater than that in output prices, and
the price markup over unit labor costs in the nonfarm business
sector continued to edge down.
Readings of labor costs this quarter are primarily limited to
the BLS monthly data on average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers. In January and February, hourly earnings
rose 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. The published data,
however, have been distorted by reporting problems with the workweek
data.16 After adjusting for this distortion, average hourly
earnings would have increased 0.3 percent in January and 0.4 percent
in February. The twelve-month change in average hourly earnings
16. BLS reports that the level of average hourly earnings and the
number of working days in the month are negatively correlated. In
particular, reported earnings growth last month was overstated and
will likely be understated in both March and April. The bias is
mainly evident in sectors outside of manufacturing.

growth has edged down or remained flat in most industries over the

earnings, and transportation.

APPENDIX
THE FISCAL 1999 BUDGET
On February 2, President Clinton submitted his fiscal 1999
budget to the Congress. In early March, CBO released a preliminary
analysis of the President's budgetary proposals, which also included
an update of its January baseline budget estimates. The CBO
analysis incorporated recent budget data, but the economic
assumptions were unchanged from those published in January. The
Administration's and the CBO's budget and economic outlooks are
quite similar.
I. Baseline Budget Projections
The Administration estimates that the budget will record a
$10 billion deficit this fiscal year and move into surplus next
year--if the discretionary spending caps enacted in 1997 are adhered
to and if no new tax or mandatory spending policies are enacted
(table 1). The baseline surplus is projected to grow to $89 billion
(3/4 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2003. This improvement in the budget
balance occurs despite a fall in receipts as a share of GDP because
the outlay share falls even faster. The Administration projects
that the surplus will widen further to 2 percent of GDP by 2008 as
outlays continue to shrink relative to GDP and the receipts share
holds steady.
CBO has released new estimates that show an $8 billion surplus
in fiscal 1998, mainly because of the continued strength in
receipts. CBO's projections are essentially the same as OMB's
through fiscal 2000. But CBO is less optimistic about the outlook
for subsequent years, and their projected surplus grows to only
1 percent of GDP by 2008 (table 2). The chief difference between
the OMB and CBO baseline projections is the expected pace of
Medicare spending.
The key factor damping outlay growth in both OMB's and CBO's
baseline projections is the restraint implied by the statutory caps
on discretionary spending, which would cause discretionary outlays
to fall from 7 percent of GDP in fiscal 1997 to around 5-1/2 percent
of GDP in fiscal 2002 when the current caps expire. The projections
hold discretionary spending constant in real terms after 2002, which
lowers its share of GDP further. Net interest outlays also are
expected to decline as a share of GDP throughout the projection,
mainly because of a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while
mandatory spending will continue to grow faster than GDP under
current policies.
Meanwhile, OMB and CBO expect the receipts share of GDP to
remain near 20 percent over the next couple of years, but to drift
down to roughly 19-1/2 percent by 2001 and hold steady thereafter.
The projected decline mainly reflects: (1) the 1997 tax changes,
which boost revenues in fiscal 1999 but subsequently reduce them by
1. OMB and CBO use different price indexes to calculate real
discretionary spending and thus baseline spending after 2002. OMB
uses the GDP deflator and CBO uses the CPI-U. The caps are no
longer adjusted for differences between actual inflation and the
inflation rate projected when the caps were instituted.

II-A-2
an amount equal to 0.3 percent of GDP; (2) an anticipated fall in
the "high-tax income share" (the sum of corporate profits plus wages
and salaries as a percent of GDP): and (3) an assumed gradual
unwinding of some of the factors (including the extraordinary run-up
in capital gains realizations) that have elevated receipts in recent
years.
II. Economic Assumptions
The broad contours of OMB's and CBO's economic assumptions are
about the same. OMB and CBO both finalized their economic
assumptions in early December, and neither anticipated the continued
strength in economic activity in late 1997 and early 1998 or the
sharp declines in oil prices and domestic interest rates since late
last year.
OMB expects real GDP growth to slow to a 2.0 percent rate in
1998 and to remain there until the unemployment rate moves back to
the Administration's point estimate of the NAIRU, 5.4 percent, in
2001 (table 3). In subsequent years, real GDP is projected to rise
2.4 percent per year--matching the Administration's estimate of real
potential GDP growth. The projected increase in real GDP reflects
1.1 percent annual gains in the labor force and 1.3 percent
productivity growth. Inflation, as measured by the CPI, is
projected to remain subdued. Although high resource utilization
rates in the near term are expected to put upward pressures on
prices, low import prices and technical changes to the CPI are
expected to hold down measured inflation.
CBO's projections are similar to those of OMB. The chief
differences are the following:
* CBO projects real GDP growth to stay below potential longer,
allowing the unemployment rate to rise a bit above its
5.8 percent NAIRU estimate.
* CBO expects inflation to pick up more than does OMB and assumes
that the wedge between CPI inflation and the GDP deflator will
be larger. All else equal, a larger wedge implies a smaller
budget surplus because the CPI is used to index spending
programs and the GDP deflator is a component of income and thus
tax growth.
* CBO assumes that the high-tax income share will fall more
rapidly than does OMB.
III. Policy Proposals
The President outlined a number of initiatives for receipts and
outlays. According to OMB, these changes would have small budgetary
effects and be roughly deficit-neutral in the aggregate. However,
the President wants to modify current budget guidelines by using
increases in taxes to lift the caps on discretionary spending as
2. The Administration estimates that technical changes to the CPI
in 1998 and 1999 would reduce measured CPI inflation by a total of
0.41 percentage point and boost measured real GDP by 0.14 percentage
point.
3. CBO expects the wedge to be 0.3 percentage point, while OMB
projects only a 0.1 percentage point difference. As CBO notes, the
wedge has averaged 0.4 percentage point per year over the past
twenty years. However, looking ahead, the technical changes to the
CPI should reduce substantially the wedge.

II-A-3
well as to fund some additional mandatory spending. CBO expects
that the Administration's policies would reduce the surplus by
$9 billion in fiscal 1999, relative to current services, and by
$5 billion to $15 billion in each of the next four years. The
difference between the two estimates stems from different views
about the speed at which the proposed budget authority would
translate into outlays.
Discretionary spending. Under last year's budget agreement,
nominal discretionary spending was slated to rise 1-1/2 percent in
fiscal 1999 and then remain essentially flat through 2002 when the
caps expire (table 4). In real terms, defense spending was expected
to fall in each of the next two fiscal years, while nondefense
spending was expected to edge up in fiscal 1999 but shrink in fiscal
2000. According to OMB estimates, the Administration's proposals do
not change the path of defense spending relative to last year's
budget agreement. However, nondefense discretionary outlays would
grow more in real terms in fiscal 1999 and fall more slowly than
previously anticipated in subsequent years.
* OMB estimates that discretionary spending would be $5 billion
higher than the existing caps in fiscal 1999 and $16 billion
higher in fiscal 2002.
* According to CBO calculations, the President's plans would boost
spending even further above the existing caps owing to CBO's
evaluation of how quickly new budget authority is converted into
outlays, particularly for defense and subsidized housing. CBO's
anticipated "spendout rates" raise outlays $4 billion to
$7 billion per year above OMB's estimates.
Mandatory spending. On net, OMB estimates that the President's
proposals would boost mandatory spending about $4 billion per year.
Most of the increase would be for provisions expected to be
authorized in the tobacco legislation--namely unrestricted grants to
state governments and a variety of health initiatives. In addition,
the President wants to raise spending on education programs, child
care, and food stamps. The President's plan to extend Medicare to
certain individuals under age 65 is expected to have little effect
on the budget, at least in the near term; this plan would allow
persons aged 62 to 64 to purchase Medicare on an actuarially fair
basis (some of which may be paid after age 65 though increased
premiums) and allow previously insured displaced workers over age 55
to buy into Medicare at set rates. Elsewhere, the Administration
expects to save nearly $17 billion over five years by reversing a
ruling concerning veterans' compensation for tobacco-related
illnesses; last year they were ruled to be service-related
disabilities. CBO estimates that the President's mandatory spending
initiatives would be more costly than the OMB expects, reflecting
4. Two budget control mechanisms are in place; discretionary
spending caps and the PAYGO system which controls mandatory spending
and taxes. In the past, there have been shifts in budget resources
between discretionary and mandatory spending, but there have not yet
been instances of interchanging resources between taxes and
discretionary spending.
5. In prior years, discretionary spending caps have been adjusted
to offset the budget effects of changes to mandatory spending
programs that were included in the appropriations bills. The
President proposes to raise the budget caps in a similar manner to
reflect higher receipts from the tobacco settlement, restoration of
Superfund excise and income taxes, and increased airport and airway
user fees.

II-A-4
different judgments about the cost savings that would emanate from
this change in veterans' compensation. CBO's estimates for the
expansion of Medicare are similar to those of the Administration.
Receipts. Both OMB and CBO estimate that the President's
proposals would add about $19 billion per year (0.2 percent of GDP)
to receipts once the changes are fully phased in. Most of the
increase would come from legislation that the Administration
anticipates will arise out of last year's tobacco settlement. Other
key proposals affecting receipts include the following:
* Tax cuts amounting to about $5 billion per year when fully
phased in, including an expanded child care credit, personal and
business tax credits to promote energy efficiency and school
construction, an extension of the research and experimentation
tax credit, and tariff reductions.
* Tax increases on businesses, including limits on the use of
foreign tax credits, restrictions on rules for corporate-owned
life insurance, and changes in the tax treatment of reserves set
aside for annuity contracts. Restoration of the expired
Superfund excise and income taxes and conversion of the airport
and airway trust fund excise taxes to user fees, but at higher
effective rates.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
Most interest rates are unchanged or a little higher, on
balance, since the last FOMC meeting. Market participants generally
interpreted Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony as
signaling that Fed policymakers were less inclined toward easing
than had been thought. With incoming data on the strong side, rates
rose in late February but retraced a good bit of that advance in
early March. Although some economic reports this month came in
stronger than anticipated, others showed inflation to be low, and
declining oil prices may have reinforced expectations that inflation
would remain in check. Federal funds futures rates are flat through
the summer, suggesting (after allowance for a small term premium)
low odds of a policy easing later in the year (chart). Despite some
evidence of slipping corporate credit ratings and weaker profit
prospects, quality spreads have held steady and equity prices have
advanced sharply.
Borrowing, except by the federal government, has been
substantial of late. With long-term interest rates at relatively
low levels, businesses have issued a considerable amount of bonds,
but they have also tapped the commercial paper market and banks in
volume. Low interest rates have spurred mortgage debt growth, which
rose toward year-end and seems to have remained strong this quarter.
Some of this mortgage borrowing has probably replaced consumer
loans, damping growth in consumer credit. State and local
governments have taken advantage of improved budget positions and a
favorable rate environment to finance long-needed investment
projects and to refinance more costly debt. The continued
improvement of the fiscal position of the federal government has
held down Treasury borrowing.
The rapid growth in the monetary aggregates in the final
quarter of last year has extended into the early months of this
year. M2 is growing rapidly relative to estimates of nominal
income, even though its opportunity cost has not changed much.
Growth of M3 has been boosted by funding needs arising from the
rapid expansion of bank assets, reflecting the overall strong demand
for credit.

of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations was a strong
$9 billion in February (table), after extremely heavy issuance in
January, and partial data suggest continued brisk issuance this
month. Speculative-grade bond offerings were strong in both January
and February and only slightly less so in early March. Proceeds
were used partly to finance investment in the capital-intensive
telecommunication sector. Net issuance of nonfinancial commercial
paper was heavy in February, though below the torrid January pace;
data for the first part of this month show some cooling off.
Borrowing from banks by nonfinancial corporations continued at a
double-digit pace last month but has probably slowed a bit in March.
Recent indicators hint at a slight deterioration in corporate
credit quality. Over January and February, Moody's downgraded
$53 billion more of nonfinancial corporate debt than it upgraded, at
an annual rate (chart). Looking forward, Moody's has $20 billion
more nonfinancial debt under review for a possible downgrade than it
has under review for a possible upgrade. In addition, the
percentage of total business liabilities accounted for by failed
businesses moved up in January and February mainly because of the
bankruptcy filings of two large retailers (chart).
Still, overall credit quality remains good, and debt markets
have absorbed all this borrowing by businesses with little effect on
rate spreads. After moving up late last year, spreads between
investment-grade bonds and thirty-year Treasuries have held fairly
steady so far this year. The junk-bond spread over Treasuries has
come down after rising in January and is just above historic lows.
Spreads on bank business loans have been little changed recently.
Market reports on the outlook for corporate profits have been
mixed over the intermeeting period. The Institutional Brokers
Estimate System (I/B/E/S) "bottom-up" forecast of year-ahead
earnings for the S&P 500--an aggregation of projections from

(chart). This owed mainly to analysts' expectations of the negative
impact of lower oil prices on energy companies, the looming effects
of the Asian crisis, and greater competitive pricing pressures on
prominent technology companies. Preliminary data for March indicate
substantial further downward revisions. Even after these revisions,
the "bottom-up" outlook has 1998 profit growth at an optimistic 9 to
10 percent. In contrast, I/B/E/S's "top-down" forecast of year-

strategists--has been revised down only slightly. This outlook has
been well below the "bottom-up" forecast, and it continues to
project 1998 profit growth of about 6 to 7 percent. At the same
time, long-run corporate profit expectations have not been revised
down at all. I/B/E/S's "bottom-up" forecast of five-year earnings
growth remained at its record level in March (chart).
Perhaps reflecting the still-optimistic long-run forecasts of
earnings, the stock market as a whole has been largely impervious to
short-run profit concerns (chart). Indeed, major indexes have risen
8-3/4 to 10 percent in the intermeeting period, leaving price-
earnings ratios at or near all-time highs. Meanwhile, volatility of
equity prices has subsided in recent weeks from the very high levels
reached at the onset of the Asian crisis (chart).
Gross equity issuance increased in February, to $5-1/4 billion,
swollen by issues to finance mergers and acquisitions and a step-up
of initial public offerings, as pricing conditions for new shares
improved. Partial data for March suggest that gross issuance has
remained healthy. Net equity issuance, however, continued to be
negative, as mergers and acquisitions retired nearly $18 billion of
equity over the first two months of the year. This amount was a bit
above the strong average monthly pace of last year. Share
repurchases also likely remained brisk, as announcements have
totaled $22 billion so far this year.
Household Finance
Current indicators point to solid growth in household debt this
quarter, near the brisk pace of late last year. According to our
flow of funds estimates, growth in home mortgage debt climbed to an
8-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1997, and
information on the first quarter suggests little slackening: Real
estate loan growth at banks and information on mortgage pools,
coupled with increases in reported home sales and high readings on
the application indexes of the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA),
all point to continued strength. Though off its peak early in the
year, the MBA purchase-money index has remained in historically high
territory throughout the first quarter (chart). The MBA refinancing
index also remains high, although below its peak in early January
(chart).1
1. The sharp spike in the refinancing index in January likely
reflects some bunching of applications that were delayed or
postponed for the Christmas holidays and hence may overstate the
strength of underlying activity.

Consumer credit expanded about 2-3/4 percent at an annual rate
in January (table), extending the gradual slowing trend that began
in 1995. Some slowdown is fairly typical for consumer credit in the
more advanced stages of an economic expansion.2 Last year's
deceleration, however, was amplified by households stepping up their
use of home equity debt (included in the mortgage debt statistics)
as an alternative to consumer loans. The staff estimates that this
substitution shaved roughly 3 percentage points from consumer debt
growth and added 1 percentage point to mortgage debt growth in 1997.
This year, cash-out refinancings of home mortgages may be
substituting for both consumer and home equity credit.
Recent trends in household debt quality generally have been
encouraging. Call Report data for all domestically chartered banks,
which leveled out last year, showed only a small rise in delinquency
rates on all consumer loans and on credit card loans in the fourth
quarter (chart). Data from the American Bankers Association (ABA)
showed a slight drop in the delinquency rate for all closed-end
consumer loans and a steep drop for credit card accounts in the
fourth quarter (chart), but these results are considered less
reliable than Call Report data.3
Other performance measures were mixed. After reaching record
highs in the first part of 1997, delinquency rates at the captive
auto finance companies dropped sharply at year-end. In contrast,
the ABA series on auto loan delinquencies rose noticeably in the
fourth quarter (chart). The MBA reported small increases in
mortgage delinquency rates in the fourth quarter, but these rates
had been hovering near their lowest levels in twenty years (chart).
Meanwhile, the rating agencies reported declining charge-offs in
January and February on credit card receivables backing asset-backed
securities. Finally, the steep rise in personal bankruptcies that
2. In the early stages of an expansion, net increases in consumer
debt tend to be large because an upturn in spending for consumer
durables boosts loan originations while debt repayments remain low.
As the expansion progresses, however, debt expands and repayments--a
function of past originations--begin to rise more rapidly, providing
more of an offset to new originations and resulting in smaller net
additions to the stock of debt.
3. The ABA series measure the number of delinquent loans as a
percentage of the total number outstanding and are based on a sample
of banks. Call Report data measure the dollar amount of delinquent
loans as a percentage of the dollar amount outstanding and are for
all banks. The ABA also has a delinquency rate series based on
dollar amounts, but it is not seasonally adjusted. This series
showed a moderate drop in credit card delinquencies in the fourth
quarter of 1997.

year.
Federal Government Finance
The Treasury ran down its cash balance last quarter and is
doing so again this quarter, thereby limiting its borrowing from the
public. Nonetheless, to bridge seasonal needs for social security
payments and early tax refunds, the Treasury auctioned two short-
term cash management bills, which settled in mid-February and early
March. The Treasury has chosen to absorb most of the effects of
surprisingly strong tax inflows and increased issuance of indexed
debt in the bill sector, leading to redemptions that have shrunk the
stock of regular (three-month, six-month, one-year) bills by more
than $100 billion since the beginning of last year. At the
midquarter refunding in February the Treasury sold $35 billion of
three-year, ten-year, and thirty-year securities, the same total
amount as in November's refunding.
To contribute further to the development of the market for
indexed debt, the Treasury announced plans to sell a thirty-year
indexed bond in April 1998 but did not announce a planned auction
size. About $41 billion of indexed debt, amounting to 1 percent of
all marketable Treasury debt, is outstanding.
Shortly after the onset of the Asian currency crises, the
prospect of sizable liquidity needs in the region sparked fears of
massive sales of Treasury securities. There was a moderate amount
of selling among Asian holders just after the crisis began in the
fall of last year, and in December 1997 public and private Asian
holders (mainly Japanese) were big net sellers, liquidating about
$15 billion of Treasury securities. Treasury data for January 1998,
however, show that net sales slowed to about half that amount.
Spreads between rates on noncallable federal agency securities
and Treasuries remained steady over the intermeeting period, even as
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) continued to issue lots of
debt. In global issues alone, GSEs marketed bonds worth nearly
$18 billion, with the bulk of that denominated in U.S. dollars. A
further spur to GSE offerings has been reduced issuance by the
Treasury. Fannie Mae and, more recently, Freddie Mac have seen this
as an opportunity to lower their borrowing costs by providing bonds
that can compete--via their size, liquidity, and maturity--with
Treasuries as benchmark instruments. The housing agencies are well

placed to expand their balance sheets to take advantage of this
opportunity.
State and Local Government Finance
Though somewhat off last quarter's rapid pace, gross issuance
of long-term municipal debt was strong in January and February
(table). A generally favorable interest rate environment kept
refundings moving along at a good clip. Strong economic growth has
improved the fiscal position of state and local governments and has
made governments more comfortable about taking on additional debt.
Authorities have, therefore, responded to relatively low rates by
raising a substantial amount of new capital in February, especially
to finance outlays for transportation, education, and health care.
Even though the sector as a whole experienced larger operating
surpluses, most state and local governments have been contemplating
cutting taxes or saving for a rainy day, rather than reducing debt,
as the best uses of the higher surpluses.
On balance over the intermeeting period, municipal bonds
underperformed Treasuries, with the tax-exempt to taxable yield
ratio rising to 0.91, near the high end of its range over the past
two years (chart). This ratio has moved up since mid-1997, as
interest rates have fallen and investors have priced into
outstanding municipal securities the increased likelihood of calls
or advance refundings.
Credit quality in the municipal market has continued to
improve. Ratings changes by Standard & Poor's since the beginning
of 1998 show upgrades exceeding downgrades by a large margin. The
net upgrade has been widespread across sectors--health, housing,
infrastructure, and power--and across geographic regions.
Money and Financial Intermediaries
The broad monetary aggregates grew rapidly in February. M3
expanded at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate, despite sharp declines in
RPs and Eurodollars. M2 accelerated to a 9-1/4 percent annual rate.
Only part of the pickup can be attributed to a more rapid pace of
mortgage refinancing and somewhat elevated tax refunds, both of
which can initially add to liquid deposits.
The rapid growth of M2 so far this year follows strong
expansion in the second half of 1997. Over this period, nominal GDP
was strong; however, M2 outpaced GDP, and its velocity fell, even as
its measured opportunity cost (the three-month Treasury bill rate
less the own rate on M2) was essentially unchanged. The

surprisingly strong M2 growth may have owed partly to a continued
rebalancing of household portfolios away from directly held
instruments and toward M2 but was apparently not a reflow out of
stock and bond mutual funds.
Preliminary data indicate strong net sales for both stock and
bond mutual funds in February (table). Household interest in stock
funds recovered from the reduced December-January pace, with
domestic funds leading the way and international funds remaining out
of favor. Disaggregated data provided by the Investment Company
Institute indicate that stock funds specializing in Asian markets
have seen very small positive net sales since the beginning of this
year, in contrast to the net outflows experienced by these funds
over the second half of last year. Although net inflows to bond
funds dipped from January's high reading, they remained well above
the monthly average of the past year. Press accounts have ascribed
some of the strength in mutual fund sales to the popularity of the
new Roth IRAs. This effect cannot be ruled out, but with IRAs
accounting for only 5 percent of total fund sales in recent years,
the current surge in Roth IRAs may not be responsible for much of
the recent strength. Moreover, the flow of assets into Roth IRAs
may owe more to a reallocation of household portfolios than to
increases in household saving.
The rapid growth of stock funds and the sharp gains in the
stock market over the past several years generated huge capital
gains distributions by mutual funds last year, mainly in December,
the month in which most distributions for the year are made (chart).
Although some of these distributions were posted to tax-favored
accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k) plans, a large portion is likely
to be taxable, further swelling the Treasury's coffers this spring.
Higher final income tax payments from this source, however, are
unlikely to reduce consumer spending very much, either because the
distributions and accompaning tax liabilities had been expected or
because those receiving them have above-average income and assets
with which to buffer any tax surprises.
Commercial banks maintained credit growth at around a 10
percent annual rate in January and February (table), and partial
data suggest rapid growth again in March. Securities holdings,
which were a major factor in asset expansion late last year, have
increased less rapidly this year. Total loans, on the other hand,
have accelerated, with the notable exception of consumer loans,

which have been weak thus far in 1998 even after adjusting for
securitization. Unlike last year, there is little evidence that
home equity loans have substituted for consumer loans. Cash-out
refinancings, however, may have damped growth in both consumer and
home equity loans. Real estate loans surged in February, with
commercial mortgages reviving after two months of little change and
residential loans responding to a strong housing market and perhaps
being boosted by mortgage refinancings.
Business loans continued strong in the first two months of the
year, in part boosted by mergers and acquisitions, but this growth
was achieved with little effect on loan pricing as recorded in the
February Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). The average
rate on commercial and industrial loans was about the same as in the
November survey, and the spread of the average rate above the
intended federal funds rate remained at about the level for most of
last year, following a widening in 1996 and early 1997 (chart).5
Call report data (chart) show another highly profitable year
for banks, notwithstanding some fourth-quarter losses at large banks
resulting from events in Asia. Narrower net interest margins were
offset by lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income.
Provisions for loan and lease losses as a fraction of assets edged
up last year but remained in check, reflecting low overall charge-
off rates. For categories other than consumer loans, delinquency
and charge-off rates turned in another excellent performance in the
fourth quarter (chart).
4. Cash-out refinancings result in new mortgages with larger
balances than the old ones. Refinancing mortgages that have been
securitized results in the extinguishing of a loan off banks' books
and the warehousing (until packaging and sale are arranged) of a new
loan on banks' books.
5. Data from the Loan Pricing Corporation and anecdotal
information tend to confirm the STBL result that loan spreads have
stabilized in recent quarters. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey, however, is somewhat at odds with this, as respondents have
suggested that spreads have continued to narrow in recent quarters.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In January, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services
widened to $12 billion as exports declined more than imports. The
deficit was the largest since the monthly series for goods and
services was first published in January 1992. Trade data for
February will be released on April 17.

Exports were 2-1/2 percent lower in January than in December.
Most of the decrease was in civilian aircraft (reversing much of the
sharp increase recorded in December) and other capital goods.
Declines were recorded in total goods exports to Korea, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Taiwan. The level of exports in January was 2-1/2
percent lower than the average for the fourth quarter of 1997.
Real exports grew at a 8-1/2 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, with the largest increases in aircraft, machinery-other-
than-computers-and-semiconductors, and automotive and agricultural
products. By area most of the increase in the fourth quarter was to
Western Europe, Canada, and Latin America; there were also increased
exports to countries in Asia part of which were increased deliveries
of aircraft.
The decrease in imports in January was in oil (there was a
small decline in quantity, and the price dropped to about $15 per
barrel from an average of nearly $17.50 per barrel in the fourth
quarter), as well as in capital goods and automotive imports from
Canada. The level of imports in January was about the same as the
average for the fourth quarter. Real imports grew at a 5-3/4

consumer goods and machinery other than computers and semi-
conductors.
Oil Imports and Prices
The quantity of oil imported declined 2-1/2 percent during the
fourth quarter of last year to a rate of 10.7 mb/d. Oil imports
remained flat at that rate in January. This decline followed two
consecutive quarters of strong imports, driven by extremely robust
consumption in the second and third quarters. Preliminary
Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports declined
in February due to a fall in consumption that is most likely weather
related.
The price of imported oil declined significantly in February
for the fourth consecutive month. For January-February combined
(shown in the table that follows), prices of oil imports exhibited
their greatest decline since the first quarter of 1991.
Declines in prices since November followed increases in the
previous three months. The run-up in prices from late summer
through early fall reflected production disruptions in Colombia and
the lagged effect of Iraq not exporting for two months. Spot WTI
prices have declined sharply since November as the market reacted to
increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. weak
demand in Asia, relatively warm weather in the northern hemisphere,
and the resumption of oil production for export by Iraq. By February
prices were more than 15 percent below yearend levels. After
dropping below $13 per barrel earlier this month, when it appeared
that OPEC would have difficulty restraining production in order to
accommodate increased shipments from Iraq, prices have risen by
about $3.50 per barrel to around $16.00 per barrel on the news of an
agreement among major oil producers to restrain production by more
than 1.0 mbd.
Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports
Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in February
for the fifth consecutive month. This decline was attributable to
decreases in all major trade categories, with the exception of

consumer goods, and automotive products. For January-February
combined, the decline in prices of non-oil imports was 4.4 percent
at an annual rate, somewhat larger than in the fourth quarter of
1997; the larger decline was attributable primarily to a substantial
drop in prices of non-oil industrial supplies.
Prices of exports declined slightly in February for the third
consecutive month. The decline was due to lower prices for
agricultural products. Prices of nonagricultural products remained
unchanged on average. For January-February combined, the decline in
prices of exports resulted from lower prices for agricultural
products, nonagricultural industrial supplies, computers,
semiconductors, and consumer goods.

services (exports rose more than imports) was more than offset by an
increase in the deficit on investment income and increased net
unilateral transfers. For investment income, there were small
declines in income from both net direct investment and net portfolio
investment. The increase in net unilateral transfers was more than
accounted for by U.S. government grants to Israel which normally
occur in the fourth quarter of each year.
For the full year 1997, the U.S. current account deficit
increased to $166 billion, $18 billion larger than in 1996. Almost
all of the greater deficit came from a shift from a surplus to a
deficit on investment income and largely reflected growing net
income payments as a result of growing U.S. international
indebtedness. There were only small changes in net trade and
unilateral transfers.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners were a
record $346 billion in 1997, up $59 billion or 20 percent over 1996
(Summary of U.S. International Transactions table, line 4). Net
private purchases of Treasury securities and corporate and other
bonds remained strong, but the increase was more than accounted for
by the record net purchases of corporate stocks totaling $67.8
billion in 1997 (line 4c). U.S. stocks attracted investors from
Japan and financial centers in Europe and the Caribbean, probably as
a result of the booming U.S. economy and increased uncertainty
abroad. Net purchases of U.S. stocks continued at a robust pace in
January.
Net purchases of corporate and other bonds by private
foreigners were up in December and January (line 4b). New Eurobond
issues by U.S. corporations and government agencies were strong in
January and showed continuing strength in February. About one-third
of the bonds purchased by private foreigners were bonds of U.S.
government agencies.
In January, there was little net change in private
foreigners' holdings of U.S. Treasuries, following a sharp decline
in December (line 4a). Sizable net purchases of Treasury bonds and
notes in January were countered by net sales of U.S. Treasury bills.
Japanese holders recorded large net sales in December and January,
probably as a consequence of the large premium that Japanese banks

were forced to pay in the interbank market to obtain funds. In the
rest of Asia, there were small net private sales in December and
January.
U.S. purchases of foreign securities were down in 1997
primarily because of net sales of foreign stocks in the fourth
quarter (line 5). Net sales of stocks in Japan of $4.2 billion and
in Mexico of $1.2 billion accounted for the bulk of the fourth
quarter sell-off. In Asia, the picture was mixed. Investors took
advantage of sharply depressed stock prices in dollars to purchase
stocks in some Asian markets but continued selling in others. In
January, net sales of foreign stocks were near zero, in part owing
to net purchases in Japan, which reversed the fourth quarter trend.
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased in
January by $2.5 billion, following an outflow of $14.8 billion in
December (line 1). Spain, China, and Singapore more than accounted
for the increase in January. Japan was responsible for much of the
outflow in December.
There were large net inflows into banks at the end of 1997,
after large net outflows earlier in the year (line 3). By the end
of January, these inflows were partially reversed. Monthly average
data on net claims of U.S. banking offices on own foreign offices
and IBFs suggest that there were outflows in February (International
Banking Data Table, line 1).
U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in
the United States reached record levels in 1997. Direct investment
outflows were up 36 percent from 1996 (Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table, line 6), and direct investment inflows were up
40 percent (line 7). The strong growth in direct investment
resulted from the continuing boom in cross-border mergers and
acquisitions over the year. The fourth-quarter flows reflected
transactions such as Merrill Lynch's purchase of Mercury assets and
ING's purchase of Equitable of Iowa.
The large negative statistical discrepancy in 1997 implies
that net payments in the current account or net outflows in the
capital account have gone unrecorded. Large negative discrepancies
have become common in 1990s for reasons that are not well
understood.

Foreign Exchange and International Asset Markets
Since the February FOMC meeting, the dollar has strengthened 3
percent against the yen. The yen's depreciation vis-à-vis the
dollar is generally attributed to reports of continued weak economic
activity in Japan together with a growing market sentiment that
Japanese authorities would either delay further or put off
completely a sizable fiscal stimulus package. The Japanese long-
term bellwether bond yield fell 30 basis points during the
intermeeting period, and the major Japanese stock market indices
declined 2 percent on balance. Yields on short-term debt
instruments also fell, as the Bank of Japan provided substantial
liquidity in advance of the end of the Japanese fiscal year.
The exchange value of the dollar has moved in relatively
narrow ranges against the mark and sterling since the February FOMC
meeting, appreciating 3/4 percent against the mark and depreciating
2 percent against sterling. The appreciation of sterling against
the mark was supported by a modest widening, of 4 to 6 basis points,
in the short-term and long-term interest rate differentials in favor
of sterling. While official interest rate hikes in Germany are
perceived to have become less likely in view of falling German
inflation, signs of continued robust growth in the United Kingdom
have kept markets guessing about the possibility of another rate
increase by the Bank of England.
The release in late February of official 1997 government
budget figures for the EU member countries, which showed that all
countries except Greece satisfied the key Maastricht reference value
of a budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of GDP, strengthened
expectations that 11 countries will participate in launching the
euro in January 1999. The EMU convergence reports of the European
Commission and the European Monetary Institute published on March 25
validated these expectations. Spreads between the long-term
interest rates of the prospective euro member countries have
narrowed further, with the Italian and Spanish rates falling 12
basis points more than those of Germany and France. Italian three-
month rates fell about 90 basis points over the period, while
equivalent German and French short-term rates were little changed.
European equity market indices have risen between 7 and 13 percent,
to record highs, since the February FOMC meeting.

On March 15, it was announced that Greece would devalue the
drachma and enter the ERM, in preparation for possible future
membership in the monetary union. On the same day, the Irish punt's
central parity within the ERM was revalued 3 percent, reflecting the
ongoing strength of the currency relative to that of the other ERM
members and making it more likely that the punt will be converted to
the euro at its established central parity.
The dollar depreciated 2-2/3 percent against the Canadian
dollar over the period, reversing earlier appreciations. The
Canadian long-term bond yield was little changed.
The dollar has depreciated between 15 and 20 percent since the
February FOMC meeting against the currencies of Korea and Thailand.
as markets perceived that the governments of the two countries were
coming to grips with their financial sector problems. Malaysia's
currency appreciated about 10 percent against the dollar. The
exchange value of Indonesia's currency underwent several gyrations
as talk about introducing a currency board system appeared to lift
the rupiah temporarily. Subsequent criticism of the currency board
plan, together with a perception that Indonesia possesses neither
sufficient foreign exchange reserves nor the macroeconomic policy
resolve to implement such a system credibly (at proposed exchange
rates considerably appreciated from current levels), led to
depreciations of the rupiah. On balance, the dollar depreciated
19 percent against the rupiah over the intermeeting period.
Share prices in the Southeast Asian economies turned in mixed
performances; increases were recorded in Singapore, Hong Kong,
Malaysia and the Philippines, while decreases occurred in Thailand,
Korea, and Indonesia.
The price of gold has fluctuated between $290 and $302 per
fine ounce since the February FOMC meeting. Gold prices briefly
came under pressure on March 18 when it was revealed that the
Belgian central bank had sold 300 metric tons -- the equivalent of
about $2.9 billion -- of its monetary gold reserves during January
and February. On March 23, the price of gold jumped $7 per fine
ounce on technical market factors; it fell back slightly over the
following two days.

The Desk did not intervene.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Partial data for the first quarter suggest that the pace of
economic expansion has picked up in the European countries and
remains strong on balance in Canada, while the Japanese economy
continues to be weak. Although there are signs that the southeast
Asian crises have begun to show up in monthly trade data.
particularly for Japan, the full impact on the foreign industrial
economies remains to be seen. Fourth-quarter GDP data are now
available for all the major foreign industrial countries. Growth
continued at a healthy pace in France, moderated somewhat in the
United Kingdom and Canada, and proceeded at only a modest pace in
Germany and Italy. In Japan, economic activity contracted slightly
in the fourth quarter, leaving the level of activity little changed
from one year ago.
Recent declines in oil prices have helped reduce CPI inflation
in all the foreign G-7 countries. Inflation is around one percent
in France, Germany, and Canada and is under two percent in Italy.
After netting out the effects of tax increases, inflation remains
near zero in Japan. In the United Kingdom, however, consumer price
inflation remains slightly above the government's target of 2-1/2
percent.
On March 25, the European Union Commission released its
convergence report, stating that each of the eleven countries that
is striving to enter monetary union when it starts in 1999 has
satisfied requirements for first-round entry. The European Monetary
Institute also released its convergence report on March 25. The EMI
noted that major improvements in terms of convergence have been made
by the EU nations, although a permanent resolution to the problems
of high public debt and deficits needs to remain a priority for
several countries. The EMI also stated that although the Italian
lira has been participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism for only
15 months, the currency has been broadly stable over the two-year
reference period.

Individual country notes. In Japan, GDP contracted slightly
during the fourth quarter, with a 3 percent (SAAR) decline in
domestic demand partially offset by a 2.3 percentage point
contribution from net exports. Consumption fell 3.6 percent, while
plant and equipment investment grew 2.3 percent. Residential
investment fell to its lowest level since 1987, registering its
fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit decline. The public
sector made a slight negative contribution to growth, as a reduction
in public investment more than offset an increase government
consumption.

Economic indicators for the first quarter suggest that the
economy remains weak. Industrial production and household
expenditure have recovered only slightly from significant declines
in the fourth quarter, while auto registrations have continued to
decline. Housing starts have remained near ten-year lows, and labor
market conditions show signs of further deterioration. Consumer
price inflation, net of the effects of fiscal measures, remains near
zero.
Japan's trade surplus during January and February averaged
$8.8 billion, slightly above the fourth-quarter average. Effects of
the Asian crises are now clearly visible. Exports to Korea and
Thailand plunged 40 percent from a year earlier, while exports to

IV-16
other Asian countries declined almost 5 percent. By contrast,
Japanese exports to the United States and the EU were up by about 15
percent from the first two months of 1997. Japanese import prices
in February were down 8.4 percent from a year earlier, led by 25
percent declines in the price of oil products and lumber.

The government has recently gained legislative approval for
several of its policy initiatives. The FY 1997-98 supplementary
budget, which includes a temporary tax cut plus new spending on
public works and disaster relief, was approved by the Diet on
February 4. On February 16, the Diet approved the government's plan
to provide ¥30 trillion to help stabilize the banking system. The
FY 1998-99 budget was approved by the Diet's lower house on March 20
and is now being reviewed by the upper house. (The budget becomes
law thirty days following lower-house approval, if it has not yet
been approved by the upper house.)
In mid-March, prosecutors arrested a senior Bank of Japan
employee on charges that he had provided confidential data regarding
BOJ money market operations to several large commercial banks in
exchange for lavish entertainment. The arrest led to the

executive, to head the central bank.
Real GDP growth in Germany slowed in the fourth quarter of
last year to 1.1 percent at an annual rate, bringing growth over
1997 (Q4/Q4) to 2.3 percent. The slowdown in fourth-quarter growth
reflected a sizable drop in net exports, as export growth dropped
back from its double-digit pace. Machinery and equipment spending
continued to post healthy gains in the fourth quarter, although
total investment continued to be held back by troubles in the
construction sector. Inventories made a sizable contribution to
fourth-quarter growth, but they are a residual in the national
accounts and are subject to significant revision.

Business confidence has remained at its recent high. Conditions in
the labor market have improved marginally so far this year, with the
all-German unemployment rate edging down from 11.8 percent in

In France, fourth-quarter real GDP increased 3.1 percent
(SAAR), the third consecutive quarter of strong growth. Domestic
demand underpinned continued economic expansion for the second
straight quarter. Although export growth slowed sharply, net
exports made a small positive contribution.
Data for the first quarter suggest that on balance the growth
in French domestic demand remains robust. In January, consumption of
manufactured products increased 2.6 percent; the broad-based rise
reflected strong seasonal purchases associated with post-holiday
discounts and continued strength in durable goods purchases.
Industrial production declined in January, but recent business
surveys suggest that business confidence remains high. The surveys
also provide further confirmation that the impetus to growth has
shifted from foreign to domestic demand as a modest decline in

Indicators for the current quarter are mixed, but on balance
point to moderate growth. Industrial production declined in
January, as manufacturing output was unchanged and mild temperatures
again led to lower output of utilities industries. However, recent
survey data suggest somewhat more strength in the manufacturing
sector. Business sentiment has remained positive, as the outlook
for domestic orders continues to offset weakness in export orders
resulting primarily from the strength of sterling. Consumer
spending remains strong on balance. The average volume of retail
sales in January and February was up 1.1 percent from the fourth
quarter, as the surge in post-holiday sales in January was only
partially reversed in February. Conditions in the labor market
remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate fell
below 5 percent in February for the first time since 1980, and

survey evidence points to continued shortages of skilled workers.
Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.6 percent
over the year to February, after meeting the government's inflation
target of 2-1/2 percent for underlying inflation in January for the
first time since last May.

In its February Inflation Report, the Bank of England noted
that while growth is expected to slow sharply over the coming year
and the strength of sterling has depressed retail price inflation,
domestically-generated inflation is "significantly above the target
level" and concluded that "the balance of risks in the projection
implies that it is more likely than not that a modest further rise
in interest rates will be necessary at some point to meet the
inflation target looking two years or so ahead."
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown released the Labour
government's second budget on March 17. The budget introduces some
new initiatives for addressing long-term unemployment as part of the
"Welfare to Work" reform and provides tax relief for low-income
working families, but the overall impact is neutral. The general
government fiscal deficit, on a Maastricht basis, is projected to
decline to £1.3 billion in FY 1998-99, or 0.1 percent of GDP, and to
be in balance in the following year.

In Italy, GDP rose only 0.7 percent (SAAR) in the fourth
quarter. Both household consumption and business fixed investment
declined, and net exports contributed negatively. A large increase
in inventory accumulation more than accounted for fourth-quarter GDP
growth. The data indicate that the positive effects on household
consumption of the government's tax-incentive program on new auto
purchases have started to subside.

First-quarter indicators are limited but point to a pickup in
growth. In January, business sentiment soared, and industrial
production rose 1.0 percent. In January and February, consumer
confidence exceeded the fourth-quarter average.
Italian inflation has ticked up recently but remains low. In
March, preliminary data from eleven Italian cities, which carry a
cumulative 76 percent weight in the national index, increased 1.8
percent over the year earlier. The slight pickup in CPI inflation
in recent months in part reflects the passthrough effects of the VAT
hike in October.

Canadian real GDP grew a moderate 3.0 percent (SAAR) in the
fourth quarter, slowing down from an average pace of about 4-1/2
percent over the first three quarters. Final domestic demand edged
up only 1.2 percent, but GDP growth was supported by an improvement
in net exports. Consumer spending grew 2.3 percent, less than half
its third quarter pace, as personal income growth suffered from
strikes by postal workers and Ontario teachers. Business fixed
investment was little changed in the fourth quarter, following seven
quarters of robust growth.
The Canadian unemployment rate fell back to 8.6 percent in
February, the same level as in December, retracing the upward blip
in January caused by the ice storm in Quebec and eastern Ontario
that stalled employment growth. For January and February on
average, employment growth was fully as strong as that in the last
two months of 1997. Lower energy prices have helped keep consumer
price inflation near one percent, the bottom of the Bank of Canada's
target range.
The Bank of Canada raised its key Bank Rate 50 basis points to
5 percent on January 30. The move was aimed at defending the
Canadian dollar, which had fallen 2 percent in the previous two
weeks to a new record low of just above 68 U.S. cents. The Bank
indicated that the easing of monetary conditions associated with the
depreciation was not appropriate.

The Canadian government announced on February 24 its forecasts
of a balanced budget for the current fiscal year ending March 31 as
well as for the next two fiscal years. This would mark the first
balanced budget since FY 1969-70 and the first time in almost 50
years that the budget would be balanced for three years in a row,
the culmination of four years of fiscal restraint aided by recent
strong economic growth and taxes paid on capital gains in the stock
market. In the current fiscal year, the C$5 billion surplus over
the first nine months has been allocated largely to a number of new
spending plans, with the largest share going to improve access to
post-secondary education. In the next two fiscal years, the
projected budget is kept from going into surplus by a C$3 billion
contingency fund and conservative assumptions for economic growth
and interest rates. Given the projected budget balances, the
government forecasts that economic growth will lower the debt/GDP
ratio to 63 percent in 1999-2000 from 72 percent in 1995-96.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Korea and Thailand continued their resolute steps toward
implementing reforms under their respective IMF programs, despite
pronounced slowdowns in economic activity. The course of reforms in
Indonesia remains highly uncertain, and the economic and financial
situation continues to deteriorate. Economic activity showed signs
of slowing in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, putting
further pressure on policymakers in those countries to intensify
their reform efforts. Inflation picked up considerably in the ASEAN
region--particularly Indonesia--and in Korea.
The impact of the slowdown in Korea and the ASEAN region on
economic activity in other emerging-market countries was not very
pronounced. Exports slowed substantially in Taiwan but remained
strong in China. Among Latin American countries, growth remained
strong, except in Brazil.
Individual country notes. In Korea, financial markets appear
to have stabilized since the beginning of this year, with the won
appreciating and the stock market showing a substantial rebound
(albeit from very depressed levels). However, there is evidence
that the financial crisis has generated a sharp downturn in
activity. Although Korea does not publish seasonally-adjusted GDP
estimates, we estimate that real GDP contracted 1.7 percent (SAAR)
during the fourth quarter. Moreover, the unemployment rate jumped
to 4.1 percent in January 1998 from 2.1 percent in October,
reflecting both corporate restructuring efforts and-a surge in
bankruptcies.
Korea's current account moved dramatically into surplus,
following two years of sizeable deficits. During January-February,
the current account showed a surplus of nearly $7 billion (not an
annual rate), compared with a deficit of $5-1/2 billion a year
earlier. Most of this swing reflected a sharp contraction of
imports, due to very tight credit conditions and a high degree of
economic uncertainty. Imports fell 35 percent in the first two
months of this year from their year-earlier level. Exports rose 9.5
percent, but most of the growth was attributable to a temporary
surge in gold exports.

The recent stabilization of Korea's financial markets has
reflected in part the success of a rollover arrangement in which
Korea's foreign bank creditors agreed to extend their maturing
claims on Korean banks. In late January, the Korean authorities
proposed a longer-term restructuring of the external liabilities of
Korean banks. This "Exchange Offer" allowed creditor banks to
exchange most of their short-term claims on Korean banks for
restructured notes that carried a sovereign guarantee. The
restructured notes have maturities ranging from 1 to 3 years, and
interest rates between 2.25 and 2.75 percent above LIBOR. Creditor
banks have agreed to exchange $21.7 billion of $22.35 billion in
claims that were eligible to be tendered. The formal debt exchange
will occur on April 8.
The reserve position of the Bank of Korea has improved
markedly since the beginning of this year, with the BOK's useable
foreign exchange reserves rising from under $6 billion on
December 31 to $20.3 billion on March 16. In addition to
disbursements from the multilaterals (which totaled $5 billion over
the period), the increase in reserves has reflected repayments to
the BOK's support window by Korean banks, and a gold campaign that
has contributed over $1.5 billion to the BOK's reserves.
Korea has continued to implement financial sector
restructuring measures called for in its IMF program. In early
February, Korea closed 10 of the 14 merchant banks it had suspended
in early December. Two additional merchant banks were closed at the
end of last month, Korea allowed foreign investors to purchase
securities issued by Korean corporations without restriction as of
February 16 and it has announced that it will lift remaining

IV-31
restrictions on the purchase of money market instruments issued by
Korean financial institutions by the end of this year.
Significant progress has been made in labor reform. The
Korean National Assembly passed legislation in February that will
ease the ability of employers to lay off workers. The legislation
included provisions to increase substantially the funding of Korea's
nascent unemployment compensation scheme.
In the ASEAN region, the substantial increases in interest
rates since the onset of the crisis, along with the effects of the
currency depreciations and associated declines in investor
confidence, have slowed domestic demand growth considerably. In
Indonesia, real GDP growth in 1997 slowed to under 5 percent,
compared with nearly 8 percent in 1996. In Malaysia, industrial
production in January was less than 3 percent above its year-earlier
level. In the Philippines and Singapore, there was a marked
slowdown in real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1997. Thailand
continued to show the strongest effects to date from the crisis:
industrial production in the fourth quarter was nearly 13 percent
below its year-earlier level.

Inflation has been rising in most economies in the region,
driven in large part by the sharp depreciation of their currencies.
In Indonesia, consumer prices in February were 32 percent higher
than the year-earlier level; a long drought has exacerbated the
inflationary pressure. The inflation rate picked up noticeably in
February in both the Philippines and Malaysia and showed a further
uptick in Thailand.

Implementation of economic reforms varied quite a bit across
the ASEAN region. The IMF approved the release of the third tranche
of $270 million for Thailand and commended the Thai-authorities "for
resolutely implementing the economic program in very difficult
circumstances." In contrast, the IMF delayed a scheduled review of
Indonesia's current program, thereby holding up the release of the
next tranche of IMF funds. However, newly-reelected President
Suharto and his economic team are negotiating with IMF staff on a
revised program. Amidst signs of increasing stress in their
financial sectors, there was some acceleration in reforms in
Malaysia and the Philippines. In Malaysia, Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Anwar announced a package of reforms on March
24-25. While complete details are not available as yet, the measures
appear to have fallen short of expectations, particularly since
Anwar did not outline concrete steps towards a previously announced
expansion of stock ownership rights for ethnic-Chinese Malays and

IV-33
foreign individuals. The Philippines agreed to further banking
sector reforms in a letter of intent submitted for the IMF Board's
review. If approved, the two-year stand-by agreement will give the
country access to $1.6 billion in credit from the IMF, and
additional funding from the World Bank and the ADB.
In Hong Kong, pressure on the currency has abated
considerably, and the stock market has recovered substantially from
its early January lows. The yield spread between Hong Kong
government debt and U.S. Treasuries at a 10-year maturity fell from
550 basis points in mid-January to around 210 basis points on March
24. Over this same period, Hong Kong's stock market rose more than
40 percent. Hong Kong authorities, as well as Chinese officials,
continue to stress Hong Kong's commitment to the fixed peg against
the dollar. Foreign exchange reserves were $98 billion at the end
of January, up about $5 billion from December.
In China, export growth continued to be strong and inflation
quiescent in the first two months of 1998. China's trade surplus of
$7.1 billion in the first two months of 1998 compares with a surplus
of $3.8 billion in the year-earlier period. Exports rose 16
percent, while imports were virtually unchanged. (Because of the
Chinese New Year--which fell in January this year but February last
year--it is useful to combine data for the first two months of the
year). This sizable surplus suggests that China's net exports have
not yet been significantly affected by the Asian crisis; Chinese
authorities did report, without providing details, that exports to
Asia declined, while exports to Europe and the United States grew
rapidly. China's exchange rate has continued to appreciate slowly
against the U.S. dollar over the past year, despite the substantial
depreciation of other Asian currencies since the middle of 1997. In
1998, Chinese leaders have consistently pledged not to allow its
currency to depreciate. Foreign-exchange reserves remained stable
in the first two months of 1998 at $140 billion.
At the annual National People's Congress in March, authorities
announced several major reforms. China will substantially reduce
its government bureaucracy, eliminating 11 out of its 40 ministry-

level bodies. China will issue about $33 billion in bonds to
increase the capital of the four major banks. China is also
considering a large infrastructure spending program in order to try
to prevent the economy from slowing sharply as a result of the Asian
crisis. Although the Asian crisis has had only a minimal direct
effect on China so far, authorities have repeatedly stressed that
they expect their trade surplus and capital inflows to be adversely
affected.
On March 24, China cut interest rates, with lending rates
falling by an average of 60 basis points, and deposit rates falling
by an average of 16 basis points. The Chinese government continues
to set the interest rates that banks and other financial
institutions can charge, and the rate cut appears to reflect
concerns about China's slowing economy. In a related move, the
People's Bank of China (PBOC)--China's central bank--also cut
reserve requirements on deposits from 13 percent to 8 percent; the
PBOC pays interest on these reserves, but it reduced the interest
rate by 230 basis points, reducing the incentive for depository
institutions to hold excess reserves with the central bank rather
than making loans.
Taiwan's exports have slowed substantially, while industrial
production remains robust and inflation remains low. Taiwan ran a
rare trade deficit of $610 million in February, following a small
trade surplus in January. The deficit in February was the largest
monthly deficit since the 1970s. In January and February together,
exports fell 10 percent from the year-earlier period, while imports
were unchanged. The sharp fall in exports suggests that the Asian
crisis may be having an adverse effect on Taiwan, whose exchange
rate has depreciated by less than that of most other developing

IV-35
Asian economies. As of March 24, the Taiwan dollar had appreciated
about 5 percent against the U.S. dollar since its lows in early
January; the stock market had risen about 8 percent from the
beginning of the year. International reserves were $84 billion at
the end of February, up about $1 billion since the beginning of the
year.

from 4.8 percent in December to 7.3 percent in January, the highest
level in 13 years. The slowdown in economic activity has
contributed to a narrowing of the trade deficit in recent months.
The trade deficit for the January-February period stood at $0.8
billion, about half the deficit over the same period a year earlier.
In early March, the central bank reduced the overnight rate from
34.5 percent to 28 percent, partly in response to the slowdown in
economic activity in recent months.
The decline in domestic interest rates may also reflect
perceptions of reduced risk of a devaluation in the near term. In
recent weeks, stock prices have risen and as of March 24 the Bovespa
had nearly regained its level in late-October 1997. Since the
beginning of the year, the spread between stripped yields on
Brazilian Brady bonds and U.S. Treasuries has dropped by about 140
basis points, to about 440 basis points on March 23. International
reserves (liquidity concept) have risen in recent weeks to $59
billion at the end of February, putting them nearly back to their
level in late-October 1997.

In Mexico, the economy continues to be strong but there are
some signs that the pace of economic activity has slowed somewhat.
Industrial production grew by 7.6 percent in January from its
year-earlier level, compared with a 9.2 percent rise in December.
The unemployment rate rose to 3.6 percent in January and remained
near that level in February.
The Mexican current account deficit was $7.3 billion in 1997,
up from $1.9 billion in 1996, and it widened throughout the year.
The trade balance continued was in deficit in January, at a slightly
higher rate than in the second half of 1997; the growth of both
imports and exports slowed sharply.

The rise in consumer prices accelerated in January and
February due the depreciation of the peso, adjustments to the basic
wage rate, and increases in prices of basic foodstuff. In early
March, the Bank of Mexico tightened monetary policy, hoping to keep
inflation under control and to prevent the rapid depreciation of the
exchange rate. In addition to more restrictive monetary policy, it
is expected that fiscal policy may have to be tighter as oil prices
continue to decline, reducing dramatically the revenue of the
Mexican government.
Mexican financial markets continue to be affected modestly by
the Asian crisis and declining oil prices. The peso value of the
dollar, which opened the year at 8.1 has fallen to 8.5, and has
remained volatile. At the most recent Treasury auction on March 24,
28-day interest rates were 19.85 percent, above their end-January
level reflecting tighter monetary policy.
In Argentina, economic growth continues to be robust. Real
GDP grew 8.2 percent in 1997 (Q4/Q4). In February, industrial
production (SA) was up 7.5 percent over a year ago. Consumer price
inflation picked up significantly in January-February. However,
this rise was partly accounted for by seasonal factors and partly by
an increase in public transport fares approved by the government;
the 12-month inflation rate for February was around half a percent.
The accumulated 12-month trade deficit in January was about
$3.5 billion, compared with a trade surplus of around $1.4 billion
in the previous twelve months. This outcome took the trade deficit
beyond the limit agreed upon with the IMF for any 12-month period.
This limit was set under the terms of a $2.8 billion three-year
Extended Fund Facility that was officially approved earlier this
year. The widening of external balances is a reflection of strong
imports of capital goods, a fall in commodity prices, and a slowdown
in exports to Brazil.
At present, there are not many direct indications that
spillovers from Asia have slowed down the Argentine economy. While
the stock market is still roughly 20 percent below where it was at
the onset of the Asian crisis, interest rates on peso and dollar
deposits and the spread between them are now below their pre-crisis
levels. International reserves (excluding gold) stood at over $21

billion at end-February, up over 10 percent from their level at end
of September last year, before the Asian crisis erupted.

In Venezuela, preliminary real GDP data confirm that economic
recovery took hold in 1997 as real GDP grew 5.1 percent in 1997,
with the oil sector growing 8.8 percent and the non-oil sector 3.3
percent. Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent in February, roughly in
line with market expectations. The recovery has widened external
balances; the non-oil trade deficit moved from about $4.8 billion in
1996 to about $6.1 billion in 1997.
The recent slump in oil prices spells trouble for the
Venezuelan economy in the near future. So far this year, the price
of the Venezuelan oil basket has averaged over $4 per barrel less
than last year. The oil sector currently accounts for about a third
of total output and over half of government revenues; each dollar
decline in the oil price translates into about $1 billion loss of
revenues to the government. The effects of the oil prices are also
reflected in the stock market and international reserves. The
Caracas stock exchange has fallen by over 15 percent since the start
of this year and international reserves (excluding gold) were just
over $13 billion in mid-March, roughly 8 percent lower than at the
end of last year.
In other developments, the Central bank has allowed the
depreciation rate of the bolivar to increase somewhat since the

start of this year, and the Venezuelan government has reached an
informal agreement with the IMF on a monitoring program which would
involve technical assistance but no actual disbursements.
In Russia, recent data indicate a possible slowing in the pace
of activity. In February, real GDP was flat on a year-over-year
basis after recording small gains in January and late last year.
The twelve-month inflation rate in January eased further to just
over 10 percent.
The exchange market pressure on the ruble which developed in
January, mainly as a result of spillover from the Asian financial
crises, intensified in early February but has since receded. The
ruble strengthened after monetary authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to support the currency and expressed a willingness to
raise interest rates to achieve this end, even at the cost of weaker
economic growth. The central bank raised its key refinancing rate
to a peak on 42 percent in early February, but subsequently has been
able to reduce this rate in three stages to 30 percent as pressure
on the ruble has subsided. Foreign exchange reserves, which
declined $2 billion in January to $16 billion, have shown no further
net reduction since then. The March 11 announcement by Moody's of a
downgrading of its ratings of Russian debt (citing rising short-term
debt, diminished export earnings and excessive budget deficits) has
had little apparent negative impact on the ruble exchange rate. In
early March, Russia returned to the international debt market for
the first time since last October, with a $150 million eurobond

On March 11, the opposition-controlled State Duma (parliament)
finally passed a 1998 budget, nearly six months after the government
submitted a budget proposal. The new budget represents a
significant improvement over budgets of recent years in that its
estimates of revenues and expenditures are relatively realistic.
The projected fiscal deficit is about 5 percent of GDP (compared
with an actual deficit of about 7 percent last year).
On March 23, Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his entire cabinet. In explaining
the move, President Yeltsin stated that it is ". ..an effort to
make economic reforms more energetic and effective, to give them a
political push, a new impulse." As interim Prime Minister,
President Yeltsin named outgoing Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, a young technocrat generally seen as supportive of
economic reform. Russian financial markets initially reacted
negatively to the announcement of the government's dismissal, but
soon recovered.
