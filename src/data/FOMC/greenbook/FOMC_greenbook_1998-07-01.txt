Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The information now available suggests that real GDP growth slowed sharply in the
second quarter, after an advance in the first quarter that may be revised upward to
almost 5-1/2 percent. The crisis in Asia and the associated appreciation of the dollar
continued to exert a significant drag on U.S. economic activity, and there are hints in
the underlying source data that growth in private domestic final demand moderated a
bit as well. The first readings on inventory investment indicate a ratcheting down of
stockbuilding early in the second quarter from the breakneck pace of the first quarter,
and the strike at General Motors clearly has caused stocks of motor vehicles to run off
this month. In the labor market, payrolls continued to expand rapidly, and the
unemployment rate held at 4.3 percent in May--the lowest level since 1970. The most
recent news on producer and consumer prices has been a bit less favorable than earlier
in the year.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market showed continued strength in May. At 296,000, growth in payroll
employment almost matched its rapid April pace; average weekly hours of production
and nonsupervisory workers increased 0.2 hour, to 34.7 hours; and the unemployment
rate held at 4.3 percent.1
The private service-producing sector once again dominated hiring in May,
accounting for virtually all of the total net increase in nonfarm jobs. In the
goods-producing sector, mining, construction, and manufacturing all lost jobs.
Manufacturing employment declined in May and has registered a net increase of only
9,000 so far this year, a pattern that is generally consistent with the slowing growth of
manufacturing production.2 Construction employment fell in May, but this followed
1. With the latest release, the payroll employment data were benchmarked to more comprehensive
counts of employment, derived primarily from unemployment insurance tax records for March 1997. As
previously announced, the level of payroll employment in March 1997 was revised up 431,000, or 0.4
percent (not seasonally adjusted). In addition, the seasonal adjustment factors were revised back to
1993. The most notable effect of the revision to the seasonal factors was to shift about 100,000 jobs in
1998 from January and February to March, pushing March's previously reported negative employment
growth well into positive territory.
2. Strikes by 3,400 workers at the General Motors Metal Stamping plant on June 5 and by 5,800
workers at the Delphi Automotive Systems plant on June 11 (both in Flint, Michigan) have, so far, led
General Motors to furlough about 92,000 workers at other plants in the United States as a result of parts
shortages. All of the furloughed workers apparently worked during at least part of the June reference

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
substantial gains earlier in the year: On balance, the industry has added an average of
21,000 jobs per month thus far this year.
Despite the robust growth in payrolls in April and May, growth in hours
worked by all employees for the second quarter is likely to slow significantly from the
rapid first-quarter pace. After declining, on balance, over March and April, aggregate
hours of production workers increased 0.7 percent in May. However, hours of
nonproduction/supervisory workers and the self-employed posted sizable gains in
recent months, and the change in production-worker hours probably overstates the
underlying slowdown in labor demand.
In the May household report, the civilian unemployment rate held steady after
plummeting to 4.3 percent in April. After the April report, we discounted this drop
somewhat. Now, with another month in hand and no rebound evident, we see no
grounds for questioning the level, particularly as the decline in the unemployment rate
between March and May was spread across all major demographic groups.
Over the first five months of this year, the average labor force participation
rate edged above the previous cyclical high posted in late 1989 and early 1990,
continuing a mild uptrend evident since 1996.3 The recent increase in participation
appears to be associated with the considerable tightening of labor markets over the
past two years. For example, among adult women (aged 25 to 64), the gradual
uptrend of the early 1990s steepened noticeably in 1996 and 1997, and rates among
younger women aged 20 to 24 also turned up. Among adult men, the gradual
downtrend for those aged 25 to 54 has halted, and rates for those aged 55 to 64--the
early retirement group--have firmed. Two groups that have not responded to the tight
labor markets are younger men (aged 20 to 24), whose rates have been little changed,
on balance, and teenagers, whose participation continues to sag.
Other indicators of labor market activity have continued to come in strong.
The latest employment survey from the Bureau of National Affairs indicated a sharp
increase in the number of firms reporting that jobs were difficult to fill; Manpower,
Inc.'s Employment Outlook Survey for the third quarter of 1998 remains very

week for the payroll survey and so should still show up as employed in the June employment report.
The shortened workweeks of the 19,000 or so workers who were furloughed during the June reference
week will, in principle, depress the measured average weekly hours that will be published in the report,
but their number was not large enough to make a noticeable difference on the overall average
workweek.
3. The labor force data discussed here and shown in the text table have been adjusted by the staff,
to the extent possible, for the CPS redesign in 1994 and for subsequent reweighting, population controls,
and recompositing.

optimistic (though it probably tells us more about the second quarter than the third);
the National Federation of Independent Businesses survey indicated that the percentage
of small businesses reporting vacancies "hard to fill" remained high in May at
27 percent; and the Conference Board's help-wanted index held close to its recent
high. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained low into mid-June, despite
the onset of increased layoffs associated with the GM strike.
Updated figures for first-quarter productivity will not be available until August,
at which time they will incorporate the recent revisions to the employee hours data,
including the adjustment for the length-of-pay-period problem. Using the BLS's
published revision to employee hours as a guide and the current staff estimate of first-
quarter output growth, we calculate that on a corrected basis, productivity rose
3.4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. On a similar basis, we estimate that
productivity rose 2.3 percent over the four quarters ended in 1998:Q1, compared with
a 1.2 percent increase over the previous four-quarter period.
Industrial Production
Industrial activity has picked up in recent months, after having slowed earlier this
year, but appears to be on only a slow upward trend--owing in significant part to the
weakness in U.S. net exports. Moreover, the shutdown of production at GM will take
a considerable chunk out of IP in June.

Large swings in utility output continued to buffet industrial production through
May, with output rising almost 3 percent last month after posting a sizable decline in
April. In manufacturing, after slipping on net over the preceding few months,
production increased 0.5 percent in April and 0.2 percent in May. However, capacity
is estimated to be expanding at a faster rate than output; the factory operating rate
declined to 80.9 percent in May, the lowest level in more than two years.
Manufacturing output had been boosted in recent months by rising production
of motor vehicles. Assemblies reached 12.4 million units at an annual rate in May, as
the Big Three aimed to satisfy the added demand that resulted from a ratcheting up of
incentives. But strikes by the United Auto Workers at GM parts facilities in Flint,
Michigan have led to shortages of key parts and have now halted GM's production in
North America. Currently, little progress has been reported in negotiations to end the
strikes, and we expect that motor vehicle assemblies in June will be held down nearly
2 million units at an annual rate as a result. The fall in assemblies resulting from the
strikes will likely trim industrial production in June about 1 percentage point and
decrease second-quarter GDP about 1/2 percentage point at an annual rate.
Outside of motor vehicles, the production of consumer goods edged up in May,
led by an increase in durables. Likewise, the production of business equipment rose
modestly, buoyed by another sizable increase in computer production. Although
Boeing continues to have difficulty finishing planes, production activity remains at
levels close to those earlier this year.4 Within the materials group, growth in
semiconductor production has slackened noticeably this year, and it is lagging far
behind growth in the production of computers because of a worldwide oversupply that
has led to a glut of chip inventories.
The Asian crisis clearly has contributed to this year's overall stepdown in the
growth of manufacturing output. The June Beige Book and other anecdotal reports
have again indicated reduced Asian exports and increased import competition for a
variety of industries. Materials producers (metals, chemicals, lumber) as well as
equipment producers (industrial, construction, and high-technology equipment, such as
semiconductor manufacturing equipment) expressed concerns about dwindling orders
4. Based on news reports and conversations with Boeing sources, it appears that the company had
difficulty completing new generation 737s because of parts shortages, minor redesigns, and
inexperienced employees. Company representatives claim that they will be able to surmount most of
their production problems shortly. Boeing also recently announced changes that will affect production
next year. First, it will begin production of the 717, the smallest plane in its line-up. Second, Boeing
will reduce the production rate of 747s from 5 aircraft per month to an average of 3.5 aircraft in
response to reduced demand from Asian customers.

and excess stocks. The separate question on export orders in the National Association
of Purchasing Management (NAPM) survey in May indicated that the percentage of
respondents reporting decreases in foreign demand continued to outweigh the
percentage reporting increases.
Several leading indicators of industrial production have weakened recently.
The NAPM survey reported that a noticeably smaller percentage of manufacturers
booked increases in orders in May than in previous months, and the staffs estimate of
real adjusted durable orders declined 1 percent over the past three months. In contrast,
the May new orders index from Dun & Bradstreet remained at a high level.
Consumption and Personal Income
Strong fundamentals have continued to boost consumer demand. Rapid job growth
and sizable gains in real wages have generated hefty increases in labor income. In
addition, households have enjoyed a further large increase in net worth this year, and
consumer sentiment remains very upbeat.
Nominal sales at the "control" category of stores, which excludes automotive
dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 0.5 percent in May. Sales were
particularly strong at general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance (GAF)
stores, where sales jumped 0.7 percent. Sales in this grouping--which are more
cyclically sensitive than other outlays--have been accelerating since around the middle
of last year. In contrast, sales growth at non-GAF stores has changed little on
balance.
In May, sales of light vehicles exceeded 16 million units for the first time since
1989. The recent pickup in sales probably reflects at least in part the sharp increase in
incentives offered by the Big Three this quarter. Most likely, the temporary nature of
these incentives pulled forward sales from later in the year.5 In addition, in coming
weeks, sales may be crimped by short supplies of popular models--particularly of
sport-utility and pickup trucks--as a result of strike-related shutdowns.
Growth in real outlays for services has also remained brisk. In April (the last
month for which we have data), a small decline in energy services held down growth
in overall service expenditures, but outlays for non-energy services rose a solid
0.4 percent with all major components recording strong gains. Given the May retail
5. Adjusting for changes in manufacturers' reporting periods, light vehicle sales were about 300,000
units lower at an annual rate than reported. Assuming they do not adjust for the change in reporting
periods, BEA's second-quarter estimates of GDP are likely to overstate expenditures on motor vehicles
(in both PCE and PDE) and understate motor vehicle inventories.II-13

sales report, motor vehicle sales, information on consumer prices, and limited
indicators for service outlays, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) are
estimated to have increased 0.6 percent in May, following a gain of 0.5 percent in
April.
Real disposable personal income (DPI) rose 0.2 percent in April--the ninth
consecutive monthly increase. The NIPA personal saving rate fell 0.1 percentage
point to 3.5 percent. In addition, the saving rate in the first quarter was revised down
1/2 percentage point, largely reflecting an upward revision to personal tax payments.6
Over the past year, the saving rate has dropped more than 1/2 percentage point.
Personal income likely posted another substantial gain in May, as two key series used
to estimate income--employee hours and average hourly earnings--posted strong
increases.
Consumer confidence remains extraordinarily high. In early June, the
preliminary reading of the Michigan Survey Research Center index of consumer
sentiment was little changed, remaining in the middle of the historically high range
that has prevailed since the turn of the year. Although assessments of expected
business and labor market conditions slipped a bit in June, both series remain close to
their first-quarter average, which suggests little overall change in households' views on
the economic outlook.
Housing Markets
The brisk expansion in the market for single-family housing has continued into the
second quarter. Strong income growth and low nominal mortgage rates have kept the
cash-flow burden of purchasing a new home low, and increases in financial wealth
likely have given added impetus to demand.
Sales of new homes moved up in May to an 888,000 unit annual rate in a
record for the series.7 Existing home sales declined slightly in May but remain very
high relative to the stock of housing units. The National Association of Home
Builders' survey of its members indicated that new home sales reached a new high in
June for the second month in succession, and applications for mortgages to finance
home purchases have been only slightly below their record highs. Consumers'
6. Treasury data received this spring pointed to personal tax payments in April that were
substantially higher than had been anticipated earlier in the year by the BEA. Following their usual
practice, the BEA incorporated the higher level of tax payments by spreading the increase over the entire
year, generating a $24.5 billion upward revision to personal tax and nontax payments in January.

assessments of homebuying conditions also remain near the all-time high reached in
March.
Starts of single-family homes were little changed in May at a level only a
shade below the elevated first-quarter pace. But while starts have been high of late,
they have been rather low relative to sales. As a result, the inventory of new homes
for sale in April equaled 3.9 months of sales at the current rate, the second lowest
monthly ratio on record. Part of the explanation for the weakness of starts relative to
sales may be that shortages of skilled construction workers have constrained building
activity.8 In April and May the unemployment rate for construction workers was the
lowest in the twenty-year history of the series. There also have been a number of
anecdotal reports that labor shortages have been restraining construction. Surveys by
the NAHB in September of 1996 and 1997 showed that as many as three-fourths of
builders perceived some degree of shortage in particular construction trades. In March
of this year a shortage of skilled labor was reported by 85 percent of builders,
suggesting that the supply of workers became more strained over the preceding six
months. 9
Reflecting the tight supply of labor, rising construction wages are putting some
upward pressure on building costs. Average hourly earnings of employees of
residential contractors have accelerated noticeably over the past year. Wages paid to
employees in special trades, such as plumbers and electricians, have not accelerated,
rising at a pace close to 3-1/2 percent since early 1997.10
The upward cost pressure arising from wage increases has been moderated by
leveling or falling prices for some important building materials. Lumber prices have
fallen 25 percent from their level of a year ago, partially as a result of reduced Asian
demand, and plywood prices are off 15 percent. Smaller declines have occurred in
insulation and roofing materials, and the price of gypsum products has been essentially
unchanged over the past year, albeit at a high level. In fact, according to an index of
8. The high level of construction in the first quarter probably was unconstrained by the supply of
workers because on a not-seasonally-adjusted basis, the level of construction employment was still
relatively low.
9. This inference is tentative because the questions were asked differently in the various surveys. In
the March 1998 survey, builders were asked whether there was a shortage of skilled labor, in general.
The September 1996 and 1997 surveys asked builders to rate the availability of workers in nine specific
trades. In both of the earlier surveys, the responses ranged from 35 percent that indicated a dearth of
excavators to 75 percent that cited a shortage of carpenters, leaving open the possibility that the share of
builders that experienced some type of skilled labor shortage exceeded 75 percent.
10. Wage data for specific types of construction workers lag the data for total construction wages
by one month. Employees in special trades work in other types of construction besides residential
building.11-19

overall building costs published by the Engineering News-Record, a construction trade
publication, rising labor costs and declining costs for some materials have been
roughly offsetting. This index has shown only a slight upward drift so far this year.11
Nonetheless, house prices have been responding to strong demand, posting significant
gains relative to the general price level. The constant-quality price of new homes rose
3.3 percent in the first quarter, year-over-year, matching the increase in 1997. The
repeat-sales index for existing homes has risen at about a 5.2 percent rate since mid-
1997.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment appears to be decelerating in the second quarter from
its heady first-quarter pace, as a slowing in growth of producers' durable equipment
expenditures seems to be more than offsetting a pickup in spending on nonresidential
structures. Nonetheless, growth in the second quarter should remain substantial--not
surprising, given that business output has accelerated over the past couple of years and
the user cost of capital has edged down in recent quarters as a consequence of
declining long-term interest rates and falling equipment prices.
Real expenditures on office and computing equipment are expected to register
another large gain in this quarter, albeit a fraction of the stunning 100 percent annual
rate figure now estimated for the first quarter. After increasing a cumulative
21 percent over the previous five months, nominal shipments of computer equipment
fell 2-1/4 percent in May. However, the average level of nominal shipments in April
and May was still 3-1/2 percent above the first-quarter level, and, combined with
sizable price declines, this points to continuing strength in real spending. Several
factors suggest that spending will continue to be boosted by rapid price cutting in
coming months. Competition is intensifying in the market for microprocessors, some
PC makers have not completely worked off their excess inventories, and competition
from Asian producers is placing downward pressure on the prices of components,
especially memory and storage devices.
Shipments of communications equipment have weakened, on balance, so far
this spring, following rapid growth in spending during the first quarter. The slowdown
is expected to be temporary, however, as Internet usage continues to expand and
telephone companies revamp their networks. Communications companies have for

some time been implementing cable upgrades and integrated services digital networks
(ISDNs) to speed connections to the Web, and now other new technologies for
improved data transmission are set to roll out this summer, providing an additional
boost to spending.12
In the transportation sector, business spending on motor vehicles continues to
be very strong. Most notably, sales of medium and heavy trucks have trended up over
the past year, reaching a twenty-five-year high in April. Unfilled orders for medium
and heavy trucks have been rising, suggesting that sales may remain high in coming
months, even if new orders slip. Concerning aircraft, we expect that despite
production difficulties, Boeing's domestic deliveries should be relatively flat in the
second quarter.
Outside high-tech and transportation equipment, there has been a noticeable
slowing in recent months, following a sizable increase in the first quarter. Nominal
shipments for this category were flat in May, remaining 1 percent below their first-
quarter average. Orders have declined in recent months and have now fallen behind
shipments.
In contrast to the deceleration in growth in equipment spending, the available
indicators of outlays on nonresidential structures suggest that real spending has turned
up in the second quarter after registering declines in the past two quarters. Indeed, for
the first time in months, the spending data appear consistent with reports of declining
vacancy rates, accelerating real estate prices, and the generally positive assessments of
conditions by commercial real estate market participants. The latest data on
construction put-in-place show that spending on private nonresidential buildings
advanced 2.3 percent in April; in addition, the figures for both February and March
were revised up noticeably. However, the data on construction contracts continue to
look weak, leaving open some question about future activity levels.
Business Inventories
Available information for the current quarter suggests that inventory investment has
slowed from its rapid first-quarter pace. After expanding at a $54 billion annual rate
in the first quarter, book-value inventories for all manufacturing and trade excluding

transfer mode (ATM). Many of the regional Bell operating companies are planning to offer ADSL,
which enables standard copper wires to carry digital data as well as (analog) voice transmissions. Other
communications companies, led by Sprint, are adopting ATM, which expands the bandwidth of the
phone line to allow simultaneous transmission of voice, video, and data.II-25

motor vehicles increased at a $35 billion pace in April. Moreover, the first quarter's
book-value increase translated into a huge increase in real stocks, largely as a result of
falling prices--most notably for petroleum--and combining evidence on producer prices
with the latest book-value data suggests that the increase in real stocks also slowed
markedly in April.
Manufacturers' inventories increased in book-value terms at a swift $28 billion
annual rate in April. However, most of this accumulation was due to a buildup in
work-in-process inventories of civilian aircraft,      
            . It
appears that the parts shortage should ease in the coming months; the time-horizon for
the resolution of the Asian financing problems is more uncertain. [The information
above from Boeing is CONFIDENTIAL.]
The increase in non-auto trade inventories slowed significantly in April as
stocks built up at a $5.6 billion annual rate in book-value terms, compared with a $32
billion pace in the first quarter. Wholesale stocks excluding motor vehicles declined
slightly in April as the result of significant runoffs in stocks of farm products and of
goods in the "other nondurable" category, which apparently reflected primarily a
liquidation of farm supply products. However, prices of some farm products have
been moving lower, so real stocks may not have declined much.13 Inventories held by
non-auto retailers increased at a $10 billion annual rate in April, down from a $21
billion rate of increase in the first quarter. Inventory-sales ratios for both wholesalers
and retailers were unchanged in April: The wholesale ratio has been flat so far this
year, after a noticeable run-up last year, and the retail inventory-sales ratio has
remained essentially flat over the past year.
After a substantial buildup in the first quarter due to unseasonably mild winter
weather, petroleum stocks appear to have climbed somewhat further in the current
quarter according to physical product data from the Department of Energy. 14
Inventories are currently extremely high--indeed, in some instances, straining storage
capacity.
13. The detail for the other nondurable category is from unpublished, not seasonally adjusted data
provided to us by the Census Bureau.
14. These data, however, are not always a precise indicator of BEA's figures on real petroleum
stocks.11-27

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Federal Government
The budget recorded a $60 billion surplus over the twelve months ending in May.
Receipts in April and May were 10 percent higher than a year earlier, led by a
12 percent increase in nonwithheld personal income taxes and social insurance
collections, reflecting robust April payments. Withheld income and payroll taxes were
9 percent higher, growing faster than wages and salaries in part because of real bracket
creep. Receipts growth was restrained by net corporate income taxes, which fell in
April and May relative to a year ago. Since the beginning of the calendar year,
corporate income tax collections have been roughly the same as a year earlier,
reflecting some leveling off in corporate profits. Outlays in April and May, adjusting
for payment timing shifts, were 1 percent below those of a year earlier. Defense
spending, adjusted for payment timing shifts, was down 2-1/2 percent from a year
earlier, although 6 percent above the first-quarter average.
The Office of Management and Budget released its mid-session review of the
budget in late May. It projects surpluses of $39 billion in fiscal year 1998 and $54
billion in fiscal year 1999; some $49 billion and $44 billion higher, respectively, than
in its January projection. Revised economic assumptions accounted for about
one-third of the improvement in the deficit outlook, while stronger-than-expected tax
payments accounted for most of the rest. The economic assumptions underpinning
these projections incorporated recent data but left most longer-term assumptions
unchanged. The relative strength seen in tax collections this year is expected to
persist into the coming year. Thus, receipts are projected to rise as a share of GDP
next year, despite the anticipated reduction in tax payments owing to last year's tax
law changes.15
Congress is still finalizing its fiscal policy blueprint. Both the Senate and the
House versions of the fiscal 1999 budget resolution call for equally sized tax and
spending cuts. However, the Senate's version calls for $30 billion in tax and spending
reductions over five years--excluding any tobacco legislation--while the House-passed
version calls for $100 billion in tax and spending cuts. In contrast, the President's
budget proposes a $15 billion increase in taxes and spending over five years,
excluding proposals related to the tobacco legislation. A six-year reauthorization of
transportation programs that allows increased spending on highways and mass transit
15. The personal income tax cuts included in OBRA 1997 reduce tax liability about $20 billion, 0.3
percent of GDP, beginning in 1998, but much of the effect on payments is projected to occur in 1999.II-31

was enacted.16 It also "reduces" veterans' programs to keep overall spending levels
unchanged.17
State and Local Government Sector
Real spending by state and local governments appears to be picking up in the second
quarter. Employment growth over the first two months of the quarter averaged
38,000, considerably above the 22,000 average rise during the first quarter. In
addition, real construction spending rose 1.4 percent at a monthly rate in April, the
largest advance since October.
State and local construction spending has been on a downtrend since February
1997. Most categories have followed this pattern, although considerable weakness was
concentrated in the miscellaneous non-building category that includes such items as
amusement and recreational facilities and power generating facilities. Highway
construction has remained fairly strong so far this year despite concern about a
temporary lapse in federal highway funding when new obligations were halted on May
2. In fact, the actual flow of funding was never disrupted, and the President signed
the new legislation, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, on June 9.
Underlying demand for infrastructure coupled with strong fiscal positions of most
governments suggest that fundamentals are in place for further strength in state and
local construction.
A recent survey from the National Association of State Budget Officers
confirms earlier reports on the continuing strong fiscal positions of the states. As in
recent years, the good health springs largely from strong revenues: For fiscal 1998,
which ends on June 30 for most states, tax collections appear to be coming in nearly
2 percent higher than the estimates states used in adopting their budgets. As in recent
years, states likely will enact numerous small tax cuts this year, which are expected to
total 1/2 to 1 percent of revenues. Meanwhile, expenditure policy has remained
16. The act boosts nominal spending authority about 40 percent from 1998 to 2003. It also includes
provisions that limit the ability to shift spending from transportation to other programs. Thus, although
annual appropriations bills could be used to limit transportation spending below the amount authorized
by this act--as has typically been the case--the new procedural limits make it more likely that much of
the new spending authority will be used.
17. In January, baseline outlays for veterans' compensation were boosted to reflect an administrative
decision that increased eligibility for veterans' compensation. The new act reverses that administrative
decision and thus reduces veterans' benefits relative to the January baseline. Under the budget
rules, changes in outlays or taxes owing to administrative decisions are not subject to the PAYGO
restrictions and do not need to be offset elsewhere, but legislated changes are subject to the PAYGO
restrictions.II-33

conservative. Regarding welfare reform, according to the survey, all states met or
exceeded their statutory maintenance-of-effort requirement for fiscal year 1998.18 As
caseloads have fallen in recent years, spending per family has risen, particularly in the
first half of the current federal fiscal year. Within welfare payments, states appear to
be spending less than in the past on direct cash assistance and more on supportive
services, especially child care.
Prices and Labor Costs
The CPI increased 0.3 percent in May, as energy prices turned up and food prices
posted their largest increase in more than a year. Consumer prices excluding food and
energy increased 0.2 percent and have accelerated to a 2.6 percent annual rate over the
past three months, reflecting, in part, a pickup in tobacco prices and shelter costs. A
similar pattern is evident in core PCE prices. Nonetheless, viewed over a longer time
period, the CPI excluding food and energy rose 2.2 percent over the past twelve
months, down from a 2.5 percent increase in the year-earlier period, while core PCE
price inflation fell 1 percentage point to 1.3 percent in the year ended in April.19 The
overall CPI was up only 1.7 percent over the past twelve months because of the sharp
decline in energy prices, while total PCE prices increased just 1 percent.
The CPI for food rose 0.6 percent in May, reflecting a sharp jump in the
extremely volatile price index for fruits and vegetables. However, that rise should be
reversed before long, as wholesale prices of fresh produce appear to have dropped
sharply in recent weeks. Other than fruits and vegetables, food prices have remained
quiet, on balance.20 In farm markets, futures prices for livestock commodities have
18. The recent reforms require states to maintain their own welfare expenditures at 75 percent or
more of their fiscal 1994 expenditure. Included in the tally are state outlays for AFDC benefits and
administration, emergency assistance, JOBS, AFDC-related child care, and at-risk child care. States that
do not move the required number of welfare recipients into work activities must spend at least 80
percent of their 1994 welfare expenditure. In addition, states lose $1 of federal aid for every $1 they fall
short of the maintenance-of-effort requirement.
19. These estimates of core PCE inflation are unpublished staff estimates.
20. Although considerable media focus has been directed this week to a recent surge in the price of
butter, the implications of that price surge for food prices overall do not seem likely to be very great.
Butter and margarine (which, since January, have been grouped together in the fats and oils category of
the CPI) have a combined weight of about 0.6 percent in the CPI for food and a weight of about 0.1
percent in the total CPI. A rise in butter prices of 14 percent over the twelve months ended in May
added less than 0.1 percentage point to food prices overall. The impact on the total CPI rounded, easily,
to zero. At least through May, the prices of other milk products did not seem to have gained much
momentum. The CPI for dairy products (excluding butter) was down slightly in May and up less than 2
percent over the most recent twelve-month period. In the PPI, the price index for dairy products ticked
up in May after two months of sharp declines; the farm price of milk plunged 6.5 percent in the May

declined sharply, on balance, since the week of the May Greenbook. However, futures
prices for crops have moved up, on net, as a price surge over the past few days has
more than reversed the sharp declines that took place from mid-May to mid-June.
Options prices have recently been signaling a heightened degree of uncertainty in
regard to the outlook.
The May upturn in consumer energy prices was 0.3 percent and reflected a rise
in motor fuel prices of 0.9 percent, the first increase since last September. However,
survey results from early June point to small declines in gasoline prices so far this
month.
Prices for commodities other than food and energy rose 0.1 percent in May and
have decelerated almost 1 percentage point over the past year. The largest increases in
May were for tobacco products and for used cars and trucks. In contrast, consumer
prices of new motor vehicles moved down 0.3 percent in May--a decline that was
surprisingly small given the Big Three coupon incentives that went into effect in late
April. (The PPI for new vehicles dropped more than 1-1/2 percent in May.) Prices
for other consumer goods were stable in May, likely restrained by intense competition
from imports.
The prices of nonenergy services increased 0.3 percent in May and 3.1 percent
over the past twelve months. The stability of the rate of increase of service prices
over the past year reflects offsetting movements in several key components. The
twelve-month change in the CPI for shelter has moved up 1/4 percentage point to 3.4
percent. The cost of medical services has continued to rise at about a 3 percent pace,
while the pace of "other services" has slowed 3/4 percentage point to 2-3/4 percent.
Core PCE prices have continued to rise considerably less rapidly than has the
core CPI. Indeed, over the past few years the core CPI has increased about 3/4
percentage point more rapidly than have core PCE prices, a gap that is wider than the
average of earlier periods. Although CPIs are the primary inputs into PCE prices, the
two price measures can differ for a variety of reasons. First, they use different
aggregation formulas: PCE prices are chain weighted, whereas the CPI is a Laspeyres
index, and the CPI should rise more rapidly than PCE prices for this reason. Second,
many items in PCE are simply "out of scope" for the CPI, which measures only out-
of-pocket expenditures of households. Expenditures by religious and welfare

PPI after small declines in both March and April. Year-to-year increases in milk production have been

organizations, imputed brokerage fees, and bank service charges are all items included
in the PCE deflator but are not covered in the CPI.21 Third, items that are not out of
scope of one index or the other have different weights in the two indexes. For
example, medical services have a much larger weight in PCE, and housing and energy
have larger weights in the CPI. Finally, for some items in PCE, BEA chooses not to
use the CPI as the price measure even though the CPI is available. Medical services,
airfares, and computers are examples. Analysts at the BLS have concluded that the
relatively large gap between increases in the CPI and in PCE prices in recent years has
owed to a combination of these factors, with no single "smoking gun."
Capital goods prices have shown no sign of bottoming out. The PPI for capital
equipment fell 0.6 percent over the past twelve months after having been about
unchanged over the preceding twelve-month period. The drop in motor vehicle prices
has contributed to this decline, as have declines in computer prices that have been
larger than usual of late. Competition from falling import prices certainly has
contributed to the softness in these areas. Indeed, the import share of capital
equipment spending is about 40 percent, more than double that of consumer
commodities other than food and energy.
There are few signs of inflationary pressures coming from earlier stages of
processing. The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy edged
down in May and was about unchanged over the past twelve months. The PPI for
core crude materials moved up in May, following several months of negative readings,
and this index stood well below its year-earlier level. Since the middle of May, most
industrial commodity prices have moved downward. Nevertheless, the Journal of
Commerce industrial price index is essentially unchanged since that time, reflecting
sharp increases in cotton prices.
Short-term inflation expectations also remain pretty well in check, although
they have backed up a little bit so far this quarter after having dropped notably in the
first few months of the year. According to the Michigan survey, median one-year-
ahead inflation expectations edged back up to 2.6 percent in May and early June after
having dropped below 2-1/2 percent earlier in the year. Still, these expectations
remain below the 2-3/4 percent average in the second half of 1997. Longer-term
inflation expectations have remained low this quarter, with both the Michigan survey's
median five- to ten-year ahead inflation expectations and the Philadelphia Fed's survey
of professional forecasters ten-year expectations remaining below 3 percent.
21. Going the other way, used cars are in the CPI but are out of scope of PCE.II-39

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Information on labor costs this quarter are mostly limited to the BLS monthly
data on average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers.22 Average
hourly earnings were reported to have increased 0.3 percent in May, after having risen
0.5 percent in April; the average monthly increase in the first quarter was 0.3 percent.
Over the twelve months ended in May, average hourly earnings rose 4.3 percent, up
from 3.9 percent over the previous twelve-month period and from 3.3 percent over the
twelve months before that.
This acceleration has been widespread across industries. The largest increases
have been in finance, insurance, and real estate, and in business services (which
includes temporary help firms), both of which are posting rates of increase near 6
percent or higher. Average hourly earnings in wholesale and retail trade also have
continued to accelerate markedly. The one notable exception is manufacturing, where
average hourly earnings were up a little less than 3 percent over the past year, about
the same as the increases over the preceding two years.
22. These series now have been corrected for the length-of-pay-period problems that had been
plaguing them. Concerning compensation per hour, as described in the May Greenbook, we are not sure
of the extent to which this series was affected by the length-of-pay-period problem. The corrected
growth rate could range from the published 4.2 percent to as much as 1-1/2 percentage point percent
higher, based on our current estimates. Unfortunately, this uncertainty will not be resolved until the
August revision to the Productivity and Costs data.II-43

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Domestic bond markets rallied over the intermeeting period amid further turbulence in
Asian and Russian financial markets. High-quality dollar-denominated assets once
again benefited from perceptions that they provided a refuge from troubles in that
hemisphere, and traders found comfort in the Chairman's testimony before the Joint
Economic Committee, which was widely interpreted as indicating that monetary policy
would be on hold at least through next week's FOMC meeting. On June 15, the yield
on the thirty-year Treasury bond hit 5.61 percent, its lowest level since the bond was
added to the regular Treasury issuance calendar in 1978 and more than a quarter
percentage point below the level at the May meeting. After coordinated intervention
by U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities to support the Japanese yen, yields backed
up somewhat; however, the yen has weakened again in the past couple of days, and--
aided by a weak durable goods report--the long bond yield has slipped back close to
its low.
The flight to safety focused on Treasury securities especially, given their great
liquidity, and spreads of highly rated corporate bonds over Treasuries widened slightly.
But spreads on junk bonds have moved up 36 basis points over the intermeeting
period reflecting both the decline in Treasuries and an increase in junk bond interest
rates. The difference between the high-yield bond rate and the comparable Treasury
rate now stands at 366 basis points, the widest since March 1996--though still low by
historical standards.
Share prices have been mixed, with the Dow Jones index down slightly, on
balance, and broader indexes unchanged to up a bit. Daily price movements have
often been sizable: At times, investor sentiment seemed to be swayed by the negative
implications for profits of the Asian economic slump and an appreciating dollar.
Almost as often, however, when there was no negative news, "bargain" hunting and
the continuing influx of mutual fund money appeared to buoy the markets.
Net borrowing by the private nonfinancial sector has shown only slight hints of
slowing. Gross issuance of bonds eased a bit in May and June from April's record
pace but remained heavy, and commercial and industrial loans at banks have
maintained strong growth. In the household sector, indicators suggest that home
mortgage debt has continued to rise briskly in recent months, and consumer credit
accelerated somewhat over the first four months of the year after having slowed late in
1997. Growth of state and local government debt, which was rapid in the first quarter,

moved down in April and May but remains strong. The federal government, in
contrast, has partially offset the strength in borrowing in other sectors, as the Treasury
continued to pay down debt in recent months further restricting the supply of short-
term bills.
Banks continue to provide a substantial proportion of total credit. Bank credit
growth picked up in May after having contracted in April. Growth of the broad
monetary aggregates slowed markedly in May, partly reflecting the rundown of
balances built up in April to meet outsized tax liabilities. Averaging through April
and May, money growth slowed from the first quarter pace but remains fairly rapid.
Business Finance
Credit market borrowing of nonfinancial businesses has remained robust of late. In
May, gross bond issuance by investment-grade corporations totaled $8 billion (table)--
down from the frantic $12-1/2 billion per month rate in March and April but still
above the average pace of 1997. Speculative grade bond offerings were exceptionally
heavy in April and May, with a large share of issues carrying ratings in the lower
ranges. Net issuance of nonfinancial commercial paper turned positive in May after
two months of contraction.
In addition to financing expenditures, corporations have continued to use bond
proceeds to repay shorter-term obligations and to retire higher-rate bonds. Indeed, in
May, more than half of the proceeds from speculative grade issues were designated to
refinance existing debt, which in some cases had been used to fund previous mergers.
Investment-grade firms stated that they planned to use more than a third of their bond
proceeds in May to pay down bank debt and to retire commercial paper.
Partial data for June indicate that gross issuance of investment-grade bonds will
likely exceed May's pace, although the pace of offerings has slacked off considerably
after an initial flurry early in the month. In contrast, speculative-grade issuance
slowed in June. Investors, concerned about earnings prospects of domestic firms after
the latest flare-up in Asian markets, forced several companies to postpone low-rated
offerings and others to reduce the size of their issues or to make concessions in the
form of shorter maturities or higher coupons. Still, the resulting increase in junk-bond
spreads was moderate.
Overall, measures of credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained
favorable at the start of the summer. Data through May indicated liabilities of failed
businesses were running at about half the rate of 1997 (chart); and in April, high-yield
bond defaults were at a $3 billion annual rate, about the same rate as in 1997 andIII-3

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
down from the $8 billion annual rate in the first quarter. Also, in May, upgrades of
nonfinancial corporate debt by Moody's again exceeded downgrades, bringing the
year-to-date net change favoring upgrades to about $159 billion at an annual rate
(chart), a significant reversal from each of the previous two years when debt had been
downgraded slightly, on net. However, net upgrades may decline in the near future:
At the end of May, Moody's had $13 billion more in nonfinancial debt under review
for possible downgrade than they did for upgrade.
Gross equity issuance increased in May to $8-3/4 billion. In large part, the rise
in equity issuance reflected a step-up in issues by firms paying down debt that had
been used to fund previous acquisitions (table). Initial public offerings also increased
markedly in May after a run-up in first-day returns in April (chart). However,
investors' appetite for these new issues waned, and first-day returns in May dropped
below the average of the first four months of 1998. On net, equity retirements by
nonfinancial firms continued to outstrip issuance by a wide margin, reflecting the high
pace of business mergers and corporate share repurchase programs. Year-to-date
announcements of the latter are off a bit from the pace in 1997, but they still indicate
that the volume of repurchases will remain high for some time to come.
Stock prices have been volatile over the intermeeting period. The changes in
prices appear mainly to reflect investors' shifting concerns about corporate earnings in
light of a more pessimistic outlook for a near-term recovery in East Asia and adverse
currency translations of foreign earnings. Basic materials, oil, and semiconductor
stocks have been hit hard over recent weeks. Nonetheless, the technology-laden
NASDAQ index is little changed, on balance, while the broader-based S&P 500 is up
1-1/4 percent (chart).
Company announcements since late May warning that second-quarter profits
could be weaker than anticipated have prompted equity analysts to aggressively cut
projections for near-term earnings. As was the case late in the first quarter,
projections of profits in the technology sector took a disproportionate hit in June
(chart). Not surprisingly, earnings projections for the oil and basic materials sectors
were also marked down further by large amounts. Analysts have yet to cut estimates
of earnings for GM; over the next four weeks, adjustments to reflect the effects of the
strike are expected to drag down projections for aggregate earnings significantly.
Nonetheless, as of mid-June, the I/B/E/S "bottom-up" forecast of year-ahead earnings
for the S&P 500--an aggregation of security analysts' projections for individual
companies--still has 1998 profit growth at 7-1/4 percent, implying strong earningsIII-6

Domestic Financial Developments
growth in the second half of the year; expectations for corporate profits over the next
five years hit another record high in June (chart).
Household Sector Finance
Household debt grew at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, at least in part
reflecting the robust increases in personal consumption outlays and the high rate of
home sales. Home mortgage debt continued to expand at an 8-1/4 percent pace, and
consumer credit growth rebounded to a 4-1/2 percent annual growth rate after slowing
to only a 2-1/4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year.
Data for the second quarter indicate that growth of household debt has
remained strong. Consumer credit grew at a 5-1/4 percent annual rate in April, and
available data for the second quarter suggest that the low level of home mortgage
interest rates is spurring another sizable increase in mortgage debt. Through mid-June,
the MBA mortgage purchase application index remained near the record highs reached
earlier in the year (chart); and the mortgage refinancing application index was in the
elevated range recorded during the refinancing boom in 1993 (chart).
Most measures of household credit quality have stabilized over the past year
and recent trends are favorable. Consumer loan delinquencies reported by banks on
the Call Report edged down in the first quarter (chart), as did those at banks surveyed
by the American Bankers Association (not shown). Delinquency rates at the captive
auto finance companies and on credit card receivables that back securities continued to
decline in April (not shown). The rate of nonbusiness bankruptcy filings increased
only slightly in the first quarter and has changed little over the past year (chart).
On balance, aggregate household balance sheet measures indicate additional
strengthening. In the first quarter, the increase in household debt was more than offset
by a further rise in assets owing to the increase in stock market prices and home
values, and the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income is
estimated to have reached a new high (chart). Recent developments suggest that the
ratio of net worth to income leveled off in the second quarter. The aggregate debt
service burden of the household sector is estimated to have edged down in the first
half of the year (chart). Lower interest rates and a shift in the composition of debt
from consumer credit to longer maturity mortgage loans have more than offset the
brisk pace of debt growth.III-7

Domestic Financial Developments
Federal Government Finance
The strong inflows of income tax receipts led the Treasury to reduce the size of the
weekly bill auctions $1-1/2 billion during the second quarter. Even so, the Treasury
cash balance ballooned, and it is expected to reach about $76 billion at the end of June
(table).
The Treasury's new auction schedule, announced in May for implementation in
July, will shift the supply of securities toward shorter maturities. Gross issuance of
three- to five-year securities is expected to be reduced $27 billion in the third quarter;
bills and two-year note offerings will rise a comparable amount. The new mix of
securities is expected to stabilize the average maturity of the public debt at about
forty-four months, up two months from a year earlier.
The latest round in the Asian turmoil resulted in a decline of foreign official
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities as central banks sold Treasury securities in
connection with attempts to defend the parities of their domestic currencies. Since the
end of March, foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities in custody at the
New York Fed have fallen about $15 billion.
Spreads between non-callable federal agency securities and Treasury securities
have held steady over the intermeeting period, ranging from 18 to 35 basis points
depending on the issuer. As the supply of Treasury debt has contracted, the agencies
have moved to satisfy the demand for highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments by
issuing non-callable notes.1 The funds raised have been used to increase the agencies'
portfolio holdings of mortgage assets.
The Congress and the Administration have reached a temporary agreement on
federally backed student loans that would extend the program through the summer,
allowing students to line up financing for the fall semester. This financing had been
threatened by a disagreement over the extent of federal government subsidy. The
compromise lowers the rate on student loans for three months. The lender's rate will
be set at the three-month bill rate plus 280 basis points; the borrower's rate would be
half a percentage point lower, with the federal government funding the difference.
1. For example, Fannie Mae expanded the offerings of its Benchmark Notes on June 3 when it
issued $3-1/2 billion in seven-year notes, a new maturity for the program and the first time they have
issued at a maturity at which the Treasury does not borrow. (The U.S. Treasury discontinued selling
seven-year notes in 1992.) Since January, FNMA has issued $20 billion of three-, five-, and ten-year
notes. In April, Freddie Mac held the first quarterly auction of its Reference Notes, issuing $5 billion
of ten-year notes.III-11

Domestic Financial Developments
Municipal Finance
Long-term municipal bond rates fell 12 basis points during the intermeeting period,
somewhat less than yields of comparable Treasuries, pushing the municipal-over-
Treasury-bond ratio to a two-year high (chart). The increase in the ratio represents a
continuation of a trend that began in mid-1997 when Treasury yields began falling.
As interest rates have fallen, investors have priced into outstanding municipal
securities the increased likelihood of calls or advanced refundings. The recent increase
of the ratio can also be attributed to the market's difficulty in absorbing a large volume
of new issues. Indeed, gross long-term municipal issuance increased to $23 billion in
May, up from the already robust $20 billion in April (table). Issuance continued at a
strong pace in the first two weeks of June.
Offerings representing financing for new expenditures remained strong in May.
Funding needs for education facilities by universities and local school districts and for
the acquisition of health facilities by nonprofit organizations continued to buoy
issuance; in May, such funding represented $4 billion of the total amount raised. In
addition, last month's issuance included a $3.4 billion offering by the Long Island
Power Authority (LIPA), a municipal authority created to take over the privately
owned Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO). By reducing the interest payments
on the LILCOs' outstanding debt, a large part of which was acquired to finance its
now defunct nuclear power plants, LIPA will be able to reduce the utility rates paid in
the region.
Municipal debt refundings dropped off in April and May from the strong pace
earlier in the year. However, with interest rates down further in early June, refunding
issuance has begun to pick up again.
Credit quality of municipal debt continues to improve, reflecting the stronger
fiscal positions of many state and local governments. Upgrades by Moody's have
been outpacing downgrades by approximately six to one, a ratio that has persisted
since early 1997.
Money, Mutual Funds and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates slowed significantly in May. M2 grew at just a
2-1/4 percent pace (table), down from the 8-1/2 percent annual rate posted over the
first four months of the year. The recent pattern of M2 growth reflects unusual flows
associated with tax payments: Households built up larger-than-seasonal balances in
April to meet sizable nonwithheld obligations, and these balances then ran off in MayIII-13

Domestic Financial Developments
when tax checks cleared. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, M2 slowed to
an average annual growth rate of about 5-3/4 percent in April and May, putting the
year-to-date annual growth rate at 7-1/2 percent. Data for the first two weeks of June
suggest that M2 is continuing to decelerate somewhat.
M3 growth moderated from the double-digit levels it registered over the first
four months of this year, to 6 percent in May. The slowdown in M3 was entirely due
to components in M2, as the non-M2 part of M3 accelerated to a 17 percent growth
rate. The institution-only money market mutual fund and Eurodollar components
recorded particularly large advances of nearly 40 percent and 30 percent at annual
rates, respectively. M3 is up 10-3/4 percent (annual rate) in May from the fourth
quarter of 1997, also well above the upper limit of its annual range.
The staff estimates that net sales of long-term mutual funds in May continued
near the $30 billion monthly pace of the first four months of this year (table).
However, the composition of flows shifted more toward bond funds; both taxable and
tax-exempt bond funds picked up.2 Sales of equity funds--most notably domestic
growth funds--slowed. Growth of international funds also dropped off, in part
reflecting continued outflows from Asian and Latin American funds.
Bank credit expanded at an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in May, adjusted for
mark-to-market accounting effects (table). The rise in May more than reversed a
moderate decline in April but was still shy of the 11-1/4 percent rate of increase
posted in the first quarter. Increases in securities holdings resumed in May, and total
loan growth strengthened.
Business loan growth, which had been weak in March and April as banks
issued collateralized loan obligations and nonfinancial firms repaid loans from the
proceeds of stock and bond sales, moved up at an 11 percent annual pace in May.
Bank competition for business loans remains intense. The May Survey of Terms of
Business Lending at banks indicated that, for large loans in recent quarters, spreads
over the intended funds rate have widened, but on net, they remain low relative to the
past ten years. Spreads on small and medium-sized loans have yet to return to the low
levels recorded in the late 1980s, but they have narrowed gradually since 1993 (chart).
2. Inflows to municipal bond funds and to domestic equity funds were boosted in May by the
conversion of about $8 billion of assets directly held in bank trust funds to mutual funds. Such
transactions tend to be lumpy, but on average they have added about $2 billion to monthly mutual fund
flows over the past year or two.III-17

likely held down by securitizations of refinanced home mortgage loans booked in
previous months. Consumer loans were about unchanged in May after dropping
13 percent in April; after adjusting for securitizations, however, consumer loans were
up at a strong 10 percent annual rate.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In the first quarter, the U.S. nominal trade deficit in goods and services was substantially
larger than in any quarter of 1997, as exports fell and imports rose. NIPA real net exports
fell sharply, yielding a negative contribution to real GDP growth of an estimated 2-1/4
percentage points. For April, the nominal deficit widened to $14.5 billion as exports
declined more than imports.

In the first quarter, the value of exports was 1-1/4 percent less than in the fourth
quarter. The largest decreases were in machinery, industrial supplies, and agricultural
products. Much of the decline in goods exports was to countries in Asia, particularly
Korea. Exports in April were 2-1/2 percent less than in March. The largest decline was
in exports of aircraft from relatively high levels in the previous month; there were smaller
decreases recorded for exports of industrial supplies.
In the first quarter, the value of imports was 1-1/4 percent higher than in the
fourth quarter. Increases were recorded across most major trade categories. The value of
oil imports dropped sharply in the first quarter because of declining prices; the quantity of
oil imported rose slightly. The value of imports in April was 1 percent less than in
March. Most of the decline was in imports of capital goods and automotive products that
was only partly offset by an increase in imported oil (entirely due to a rise in quantity).

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
Oil imports and prices. The quantity of imported oil rose to a rate of 10.83 mb/d
in the first quarter of 1998. Oil imports rose sharply in April, primarily due to an
acceleration in stockbuilding; surprisingly strong consumption also contributed to the
sharp increase. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports
remained strong again in May, due to a large accumulation of stocks; oil consumption
returned closer to its April rate.
For the first quarter, the price of imported oil dropped by about 21 percent, the
largest decrease since the first quarter of 1991. Prices began declining sharply in
November in response to increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the
United Arab Emirates, to weak demand in Asia, to relatively warm weather in the
northern hemisphere, and to the resumption of oil production for export by Iraq. The
price of imported oil then rose slightly in April and May, following cuts in production by
OPEC and non-OPEC countries. After trading in a range of $14.75 to $16.50 per barrel
during April and May, the spot price for WTI plunged during June-WTI traded briefly
below $12/b--following reports of surprisingly high levels of oil stocks and a sharp
downward revision in estimates of Asian oil consumption during the first quarter of
1998Q1. The spot price has rebounded on news of further cuts in production by major oil
producers. Currently, WTI is trading at just under $15/b.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased
0.3 percent in May, the same amount as in April. This decline was attributable to
decreases in all major trade categories with the exception of consumer goods and
industrial supplies, which remained unchanged from their April levels. For April-May
combined, import prices declined 3-1/4 percent (AR) relative to their first-quarter levels.
Prices of total exports rose 0.1 percent in May, after falling for five consecutive
months. This increase was mainly attributable to an increase in prices of agricultural
exports. Prices for most other major trade categories decreased; the exceptions were
prices of automotive products and capital goods other than computers and
semiconductors, which remained unchanged. For April-May combined, export prices
declined 2-1/2 percent (AR) relative to their first-quarter levels.IV-4

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit increased $8.6 billion (SAAR) in the first quarter of
1998. A substantial increase in the deficit on trade in goods and services more than offset
an increase in net investment income and an increase in net unilateral transfers. The jump
in the trade deficit reflected both a drop in exports and an increase in imports. The rise in
net investment income was primarily due to larger receipts from U.S. assets held abroad,
while payments on foreign assets in the United States were virtually unchanged. The
increase in net unilateral transfers in the first quarter reflected lower U.S. government
grant disbursements, which were boosted in the fourth quarter by the annual payment of
grants to Israel.
As is customary each June, estimates of U.S. international transactions were
revised to incorporate updated source data and improved methodologies. These revisions
lowered the deficit $10 to $14 billion in 1994 through 1997 and had much smaller effects
on the deficit in 1986 through 1993. The revisions to annual data affected mostly
estimates of capital flows, as well as income payments and receipts. In addition, the
quarterly pattern of trade was revised substantially, as seasonal factors were revised. The
largest adjustment was to exports of civilian aircraft, which are are now seasonally
adjusted. The effects of the revised seasonals was to largely eliminate the amount of
"residual" seasonality in total goods exports.

International Developments
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Led by almost $25 billion in net purchases of U.S. corporate and other bonds, foreign net
purchases of U.S. securities were very strong in April (lines 4 and 4b of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions table). By contrast, net purchases of Treasuries and
corporate stocks were modest (lines 4a and 4c). A contributing factor to April's surge in
bond purchases by foreigners was probably the very high level of new offerings of
Eurobonds by U.S. corporations; offerings were much lower in May. About half the net
bond purchases were made in the United Kingdom; Japanese residents increased their
holdings by almost $3 billion.
Although net foreign purchases of both Treasuries and corporate stocks were low
in April, holdings by residents of various countries changed markedly. Japanese residents
reversed their net sales of the first quarter and picked up over $7 billion in U.S. Treasury
obligations. On the other hand, residents of the Netherlands Antilles, the British West
Indies, and Bermuda (presumably hedge funds) sold almost $10 billion in Treasuries
(mostly bonds and notes). The modest net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks reflected
purchases of over $7 billion by investors in Europe and Japan and sales of more than $3
billion in the Netherlands Antilles and Bermuda.
Almost all of the U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in April were in the form
of bonds (lines 5 and 5a). $4.5 billion of this total was in Korean bonds, the probable
result of the flotation of several new issues by the Korean government.
Foreign official reserve assets held in the United States changed little on net in
April (line 1); however, G-10 reserves fell substantially, primarily because of Japanese
intervention operations (line la). Brazilian and Korean reserves increased significantly.
Preliminary information from FRBNY shows little change in custody holdings for
foreign official institutions in May.
Recently released (preliminary) BOP data for the first quarter show a continuation
of robust direct investment capital outflows and inflows (lines 6 and 7). Both are down
somewhat from the (revised) figures for the fourth quarter of 1997, but are close to the
1997 average. The statistical discrepancy in the first quarter is virtually zero; the revised
figure for 1997 showed nearly $100 billion in unrecorded capital outflows, with half of
that total coming in the fourth quarter.IV-7

International Developments
Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar continued to move up against most major currencies following the May
FOMC meeting, but its climb was interrupted on Wednesday June 17, when the Desk
conducted joint intervention operations in the foreign exchange market for the United
States and Japan. Between the May FOMC meeting and mid-June, the dollar had risen
more than 2 percent on a weighted average basis against the major currencies (narrow
index). Immediately following the intervention operation, the dollar gave up those gains
and more but has since drifted back up to end the period more than 1-1/4 percent higher
on balance.
The dollar's overall rise prior to the intervention operations was led by an
appreciation of more than 6 percent against the yen. The dollar was boosted against the
yen by signs of further deterioration in economic activity in Japan and concerns about the
impact of Japan's slide on other Asian economies and the rest of the world. The pace of
the dollar's climb picked up following remarks from Treasury Secretary Rubin on
June 11, which were interpreted by market participants as an indication that the United
States did not intend to assist Japan in dealing with its problems, although the Secretary
did state that intervention support had not been taken off the table. Six days later the
Desk sold $833 million for the accounts of the Treasury and the System     
        . This was the first operation for U.S.
accounts since August 15, 1995. The action, combined with news that high-level U.S.
monetary officials were traveling to Japan to discuss its economic problems with
Japanese authorities, was seen as signaling that the United States had secured or expected
to secure from Japan a commitment to undertake some further significant policy measures
to address Japan's flagging activity and weak financial system. As a consequence, the
dollar reversed course sharply against the yen. In the days following the operation,
however, optimism about prospects for concrete policy developments began to erode, and
the dollar ended the period up more than 3 percent on balance against the yen.
The bellwether government bond yield in Japan declined to a record low of
1.19 percent in early June, as prospects for recovery dimmed and the Bank of Japan
appeared to be considering the possibility of reducing its official discount rate from the
already low level of 1/2 percent. The yield rebounded, however, with the reversal of the
yen, ending the period down only 6 basis points on balance at 1.26 percent. Short-term
interest rates in Japan were little changed, and equity prices declined about 1-3/4 percent
on net.IV-9

International Developments
The Canadian dollar declined to a record level of C$1.4754 per U.S. dollar near
the end of the period. On balance, the Canadian dollar moved down more than 1-1/4
percent against the U.S. dollar, as the weakness in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, along
with an associated decline in commodity prices, weighed on the Canadian currency. The
Australian dollar also suffered under those influences, reaching a twelve-year low of
US$0.5859. While the Australian dollar recovered some with the yen, it still ended the
period down 1-1/2 percent against the U.S. dollar.
Sterling rose 2-3/4 percent on balance against the dollar during the intermeeting
period, buoyed by a surprise increase on June 4 of 1/4 percentage point in the official RP
rate of the Bank of England to 7-1/2 percent and later data releases that fostered
expectations of at least one more increase in the near term. The three-month interbank
interest rate in the United Kingdom rose 31 basis points during the period. The yield on
the ten-year gilt declined 10 basis points, somewhat less than the 20 to 30 basis point
declines in yields of comparable securities in the United States and Europe.
The dollar moved only slightly on balance against the continental European
currencies, as long-term interest rates in Germany and the United States declined apace.
European share prices showed mixed changes, with prices down in the United Kingdom
and Italy but up in Germany and France.
Against other important currencies, the dollar firmed about 2 percent on a trade-
weighted basis. The most notable change among Asian emerging market currencies was
in the value of the Indonesian rupiah, which depreciated more than 20 percent against the
dollar during the period. Despite an early firming of the rupiah following the relatively
orderly passage of power from President Suharto to his vice-president and the debt
exchange agreement reached between Indonesia and creditor banks, the rupiah
subsequently moved down sharply with the yen and rising concern about the economic
problems of Japan. An easing of short-term interest rates by Bank Indonesia may also
have contributed to the decline in the rupiah. By comparison, the declines in other Asian
currencies were small at 5 percent or less, and the Korean won firmed 4 percent during
the period. The Mexican peso depreciated more than 4 percent against the U.S. dollar, in
part in reaction to declining oil prices.
Emerging market equity prices generally continued on their downtrend during the
period. Declines on the order of 23 percent occurred in Thailand and Russia, as monetary
authorities in the two countries raised interest rates to combat downward pressures on
their currencies. Short-term interest rates increased 2 and 4-1/2 percentage points,
respectively, in Thailand and Russia, and credit spreads on dollar-denominated debt in theIV-11

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The Japanese economy appears to have fallen into recession, with economic activity
contracting sharply during the first quarter and monthly indicators suggesting a further
decline during the second quarter. In contrast, domestic demand in the major European
economies expanded strongly during the first quarter, with particular strength in
investment.
The Asian crisis, coupled with the intensifying recession in Japan, has
significantly weakened the external performance of the foreign industrial countries.
Export growth in all of these countries has slowed in recent quarters, while imports have
generally remained strong. During the first quarter, external demand made a negative
contribution to growth in all countries except Canada. In the major European economies,
net exports subtracted 2-3 percentage points from growth.
Inflation in most of these countries remains quiescent. However, in the United
Kingdom, consumer prices were up 3.2 percent in May from a year earlier, well above the
government's 2-1/2 percent target.
Individual country notes. In Japan, first-quarter GDP fell 5.3 percent (SAAR),
led by an 18.8 percent plunge in private nonresidential investment. This weakness in
investment seems to reflect the high level of uncertainty in the economy and the fact that
banks have become more conservative in their lending practices. Private consumption,
however, was up slightly from the previous quarter, supported by a temporary tax cut
implemented in February. Public demand subtracted almost 1 percentage point from
growth, as both government consumption and public investment declined. Imports fell
5.3 percent, but exports dropped 14.2 percent; accordingly, external demand subtracted
1.4 percentage points from growth. The government also revised 1997Q4 GDP growth
downward from -0.7 percent to -1.5 percent.IV-13

Economic indicators for the second quarter suggest continued weakness in
economic activity. Industrial production in April registered its third consecutive month
of sharp decline, and labor market conditions deteriorated further. The unemployment
rate increased to a post-war high of 4.1 percent, and the offers-to-applicants ratio declined
to 0.55, its lowest level since 1978. Wages and total employment were both down
slightly from year-earlier levels. Labor market uncertainty appears to be weighing
heavily on the household sector, where expenditures fell sharply in April, fully reversing
a March rebound. Auto registrations in April and May were down 4 percent (not
annualized) from their first-quarter average. Consumer price inflation, net of the effect of
fiscal measures, remains near zero.
Japan's trade surplus during the first five months of the year was $109 billion at an
annual rate, well above the $83 billion surplus registered in all of 1997. Exports during
the first five months (valued in dollar terms) were 7 percent below their 1997 average, but
imports dropped a sizable 16 percent. The weakness in exports primarily reflects the
impact of the Asian crisis. Exports to Korea, Thailand and Indonesia were all down
sharply from a year earlier, while exports to the United States and (particularly) the
European Union continued to register strong gains. The weakness in imports is due
largely to the ongoing contraction in Japanese private domestic demand.IV-14

In the Euro area (the eleven countries scheduled to enter monetary union),
domestic demand showed significant strength during the first quarter, but the Asian crisis
is beginning to affect economic performance. Net exports subtracted 2-3 percentage
points from first-quarter growth in the major European economies, and business
confidence slipped in May, owing largely to lower export orders. Area-wide consumer
confidence, however, has continued to rise.
Real GDP in Germany rose 3.9 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter owing to a 6.3
percent surge in domestic demand, confirming indications in recent quarters that domestic
demand has been picking up. The growth of domestic demand was led by significant
increases in private consumption and investment spending. Exports continued to expand,
although at a less robust pace than in recent years, and the rate of import growth picked
up, so that the external sector made a negative contribution to growth.
Indicators for the second quarter suggest that growth may have slowed a bit from
the robust pace in the first quarter. Industrial output and business confidence fell in
April, while manufacturing orders rose. Conditions in the labor market have continued to
improve; the all-German unemployment rate declined further in May to 11.2 percent.
Consumer price inflation has remained very low despite the 1 percentage point increase
in the value-added tax implemented in April.IV-15

In France, real GDP increased 2.2 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, with
domestic demand expanding 4.8 percent. Although private consumption decelerated
from the rapid pace of the fourth quarter, it still recorded growth of 2.4 percent, and
business investment increased 4.4 percent. Net exports subtracted 2.5 percentage points
from growth in the first quarter, as imports surged more than 11 percent and export
growth weakened. The major surprise in the release was a 2.2 percentage point
contribution from inventories, as inventory levels rebounded from recent lows.
Second-quarter data are limited but suggest that domestic demand has remained
firm. Although auto sales in April were down slightly, retail sales at large stores were
strong, and consumption of manufactured products rose again in May (up 2.8 percent in
the first five months of 1998). INSEE's consumer survey showed that consumer
confidence gained momentum in May. Consumer price inflation remains near 40-year
lows.

Following negotiations lasting more than a year, the French Finance Ministry
recently announced preliminary agreement with the European Commission regarding
terms of a bailout of Credit Lyonnaise by the French government According to the
agreement, the ailing bank will sell more than $100 billion of its assets, and the bank will
be privatized by October 1999. The Ministry indicated that privatization will be open and
non-discriminatory, dispelling concerns that the government would attempt to keep the
bank in French hands.
In Italy, real GDP declined 0.4 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, after 0.8
percent growth in the fourth quarter. Domestic demand during the first quarter expanded
at a healthy pace as a result of strength in business fixed investment. Net exports
contracted due to weaker Asian demand for Italian exports. The first-quarter decline also
reflected the fading impact on auto sales of soon-to-expire tax incentives and fewer
working days than in the last quarter of 1997.
Second-quarter monthly indicators are mixed. Although industrial production
declined further in April, consumer confidence in May soared to its highest level in eight
years, while business sentiment and expected future production levels remained high.
Inflation remains below 2 percent.IV-18

fell sharply. Investment surged 16.3 percent, and consumer expenditure moderated
somewhat from the fourth quarter's rapid pace.
Indicators for the second quarter suggest significant variation in growth rates
across sectors. In manufacturing, business confidence has fallen sharply in recent
months, reflecting concerns about both domestic and export demand. Industrial
production picked up in April, owing to an increase in utilities production as temperatures
returned to normal following a mild winter, but manufacturing output was essentially
unchanged. Survey data, however, suggest that service industries continued to grow
strongly in April, and retail sales surged in May. The average volume of retail sales in
April and May was 0.5 percent above the first-quarter average.

Conditions in the labor market have tightened further, putting pressure on wages.
The official claimant unemployment rate remained 4.8 percent in May, its lowest rate
since 1980. Surveys continue to point to skills shortages, and average annual earnings
growth accelerated to 5.2 percent in March. The twelve-month rate of British retail price
inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) rose to 3.2 percent in May, well above
the 2-1/2 percent target; much of the increase from March's 2.6 percent rise reflects
higher food prices and the timing of tax measures imposed in the last budget.IV-20

On June 18, the U.K. Government announced that it will set a national minimum

minimum wage is expected to cover about 9 percent of the workforce and to add about
0.5 percentage point to annual earnings growth.

In Canada, real GDP rose 3.7 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter of 1998. The
Canadian economy shook off the negative effects of the January ice storm to maintain the
robust average pace of growth recorded over the previous six quarters. Domestic demand
edged up only 0.6 percent, as consumer spending grew at a 2.6 percent pace, but fixed
investment declined 0.6 percent. Net exports, however, contributed 2.5 percentage points
to growth, with exports expanding at a 6 percent rate and imports declining slightly. The
strong contribution from the external sector during the first quarter can largely be
attributed to rapid U.S. economic growth and the effects of Canadian dollar depreciation.
Monthly indicators point to an acceleration in domestic demand growth and a
weakening in net exports in the current quarter. Consumption is supported by strong
growth in jobs and income, with employment for the April/May period up 3.1 percent
(SAAR) from the first quarter average. With capacity utilization at its highest level since

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
1988, investment is likely to rebound from weakness in the past two quarters. Building
permits indicate strength in construction spending; the decline in housing starts in May
partly reflected labor strikes that have since been resolved.

Canada's trade surplus narrowed sharply in April. The deteriorating trade balance
owed to fallout from the turmoil in Asia, which has weakened exports, as well as to a
strengthening of Canadian domestic demand, which has spurred imports. Most notably,
Canadian exports to Japan declined 43 percent in April versus the same month a year ago,
while imports from Japan increased 20 percent Canadian exports to the United States
and Europe have risen relative to a year ago but by less than the rise in Canadian imports
from those countries.IV-22

International Developments
Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Korea and the ASEAN region, economic activity has declined sharply, mainly due to a
marked contraction in domestic demand. Growth has slowed in China and Taiwan, while
contracting sharply in Hong Kong. In Latin America, growth was strong in Argentina
and Mexico, but weak in Brazil and Venezuela. Inflation has generally been stable to
moderate, although it has been moving up in most of the affected Asian economies and
has accelerated sharply in Indonesia.
The general adjustment toward surplus in external balances in Asia continued,
with the exception of Taiwan. In Latin America, external balances continued to
deteriorate except in Brazil, where the trade deficit narrowed further.
Implementation of reforms continued in Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines
under their respective IMF programs. In May, Indonesia experienced a wave of anti-
government demonstrations that toppled President Suharto; consequently the IMF
postponed the $1 billion disbursement scheduled in early June. Elsewhere, Malaysia
established the Asset Management Corporation to buy nonperforming loans from banks,
and Singapore announced a five-step program to strengthen its banking system.
Individual country notes. Korea's financial crisis has generated a sharp decline
in economic activity. Real GDP contracted 3.8 percent in 1998-Q1 on a four quarter-
change basis. We estimate that on a seasonally-adjusted basis, real GDP contracted
almost 23 percent (annual rate) from its level in 1997-Q4. Korea's output contraction
reflects a collapse of domestic demand, particularly of fixed investment and inventories.
The domestic demand contraction has been driven by a severe credit crunch, a high
degree of economic uncertainty, and balance sheet adjustments by households and over-
leveraged corporations.
Consumer price inflation rose to 8.2 percent in May on a 12 month-change basis,
compared with an average rate of about 4 percent in the recent pre-crisis period. The
relatively modest rise in consumer price inflation, despite a depreciation of the won of
about 45 percent against the dollar since mid-October, appears attributable to the
restraining effect of the downturn in aggregate demand on the prices of domestically-
produced goods and services.
Korea has achieved a large and rapid improvement in its trade balance. During
the January-April 1998 period, Korea's trade balance improved $70 billion (annual rate)
from the same four months a year earlier, rising from a deficit of $26 billion to a surplus
of $43 billion. Most of the improvement in the nominal trade balance has reflected a fall
in imports. Export growth in dollar terms has remained modest, but dollar prices haveIV-27

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
fallen sharply and the volume of exports has increased markedly, partly offsetting the
effects of reduced domestic demand on output.
Korea's usable international reserves rose to almost $37 billion on June 23 from
$24 billion at end-March, and the won has remained roughly stable in the range of 1400
won/dollar. However, the stock market has performed poorly, closing on June 24 roughly
15 percent below its December 1997 trough. Labor unrest has contributed to the poor
performance of Korea's stock market. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions
(KCTU), Korea's second largest trade union, with a reputation for being highly
confrontational, staged a two day strike on May 27-28. Labor tensions have eased since
early June, due in part to a lack of public support for strikes.
The Korean authorities have taken steps in recent weeks that suggest a willingness
to accelerate financial sector cleanup and restructuring. This shift follows the strong
performance of President Kim Dae Jung's coalition parties in Korea's local elections (held
June 4), which were viewed as a referendum on President Kim's reform policies. The
steps taken by the authorities include allocating an additional 50 trillion won (11 percent
of GDP) to help finance the financial sector cleanup and restructuring, and a plan that
requires banks to cut off credit to firms that the banks have assessed as insolvent.

In the ASEAN region, weakening domestic demand, tight credit conditions, and
Japan's worsening economy continued to dampen economic activity. In Indonesia, real
GDP fell by 6.2 percent (year-over-year SAAR) in the first quarter of 1998, while
Malaysian GDP dropped 22.8 percent at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate. Industrial
production declined sharply in Thailand in the first quarter.IV-28

Consumer prices continued to accelerate in Indonesia as distribution systems were
slow to recover from the disruptions caused by the riots in early May and the weakening
currency boosted the prices of imports. The Philippines also experienced a surge in
inflation due in part to severe drought conditions. Elsewhere, weakening demand, as
economies slowed, moderated inflationary pressures from depreciating currencies.

Trade surpluses widened further in most of the ASEAN countries in the first

domestic demand. Malaysia and Thailand also reported a decline in exports in the first
quarter of 1998, partly the result of difficulties in obtaining trade credit.IV-29

Implementation of economic reforms varied across the ASEAN region. In the
second week in May, Indonesia experienced a wave of anti-government demonstrations
that sparked violence and toppled President Suharto. Although the transition of power to
Vice President Habibie was relatively smooth, worsening economic conditions prompted
the government to reinstate some subsidies and delay various reforms. The IMF
Executive Board postponed the $1 billion disbursement scheduled in early June and has
sent a mission to reevaluate the situation. Indonesia did, however, reach an agreement
with its foreign bank creditors on a framework to restructure interbank, trade, and
corporate debt.
Elsewhere, Malaysia has established the Asset Management Corporation to buy
nonperforming loans from banks and plans to raise $6.6 billion to fund it by reallocating
some government revenues, mandating contributions from financial institutions, and
borrowing from local and foreign investors. Newly elected Philippine President Estrada
has promised to continue implementing the IMF program and picked a strong economic
team. Singapore announced a five-step program to strengthen its banking system that
includes bringing disclosure norms up to international standards. The Thai Cabinet
approved a fourth IMF letter of intent that cleared the way for disbursement of $133
million in early June.
In Hong Kong, economic activity has continued to weaken. According to
preliminary estimates, GDP fell an estimated 9-1/2 percent in the first quarter (SAAR).
In the March-May period, the unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent, compared with a
rate of only 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997. Interest rates rose sharply in mid-
June as weakness of the yen contributed to speculative pressure on Hong Kong's
exchange rate. On June 23, the yield spread between Hong Kong government securities
and comparable U.S. Treasuries was around 475 basis points at maturities of 1-10 years,
up about 175 basis points from the beginning of the month.IV-30

International Developments
In China, industrial production has slowed, while imports, exports and consumer
prices have fallen from year-earlier levels in recent months. China's trade surplus
remains high. Compared with year-earlier levels the dollar value of exports was up 9
percent in the first five months of this year, but fell nearly 2 percent in May. While the
dollar value of imports rose 2 percent in the first five months, they fell nearly 4 percent in
May. Inflows of foreign direct investment fell nearly 2 percent in the first five months of
the year from a year earlier, with declines particularly sharp in April and May.

Taiwan's GDP rose 5.9 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. We
estimate that growth slowed from about 8 percent (SAAR) in the second half of 1997 to
about 2 percent in the first quarter. Export growth slowed substantially. Exports to Asia
fell sharply from year-ago levels, while exports to the United States and Europe rose
slightly; imports fell 3 percent. A very small trade surplus in the first four months of
1998 compares with a surplus of $4.8 billion (AR) in the year-earlier period. Consumer
price inflation has risen to about 2 percent (year-over-year) thus far in 1998.

In Mexico, economic activity remains strong with GDP increasing 6.6 percent in
1998-Q1 on a four quarter-change basis. Industrial production growth dropped
precipitously in April to 2.2 percent, due in part to the shorter number of work days in
April stemming from the timing of Holy Week. Otherwise, there is little evidence of an
economic slowdown, despite the decline in oil prices and the effects of the Asian crisis.
The unemployment rate was 3.2 percent in May, compared with 3.7 percent in 1997. The
trade deficit narrowed somewhat in May to $4.3 billion, while inflation slowed to 10
percent (monthly change at an annual rate).

Events in Asia and declining oil prices continue to influence the Mexican
financial markets. Since the beginning of May the peso has declined almost 5 percent,
the stock market has fallen 13 percent and spreads on Mexican Brady bonds, adjusted for
collateral, have risen 125 basis points. In addition, the 28-day Cetes rate, which stood
below 18 percent for the most of May, has surged, rising over 200 basis points.
In Brazil, there are few indications that economic activity has recovered in recent
weeks, despite the reduction in the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Industrial
production declined over 11 percent in April (SAAR.). Consumer durables production
led the decline, plunging nearly 17 percent. While the April results may reflect some
residual seasonality due to the Easter holiday (which fell in April this year), industrial
production is well below its level in October 1997, when the central bank nearly doubled
the overnight borrowing rate to over 40 percent to defend the real from downward
pressures. The overnight rate has been gradually reduced since then, and currently standsIV-32

International Developments
at 21.75 percent. Unemployment dipped to below 8 percent in April, but the slight
decline reflected the exit of workers from the labor force (mainly women and students).
Consumer price inflation rose to 4.8 percent in May over the previous year; surging food
prices owing to a severe drought in the northeast accounts for much of the rise.
Stock prices have fallen roughly 25 percent since mid-April, reflecting in part
repercussions from problems in Asia and Russia. The decline also reflected electoral poll
results indicating that President Cardoso's re-election next October is no longer certain.
Lula, the leftist candidate making his third presidential bid, has gained considerably in
recent weeks, aided by widespread concerns over high unemployment.

Brazil's overall fiscal deficit has been disappointingly high in recent months at 6.5
percent of GDP, in part reflecting a large increase in the governments cost of servicing its
debt as a result of high interest rates. Although the trade deficit has continued to narrow,
the improvement in the trade balance has been offset somewhat by higher interest
payments on external debt, so the current account deficit has narrowed only slightly in
recent months and stands at about 3.5 percent of GDP. In late May, one-year interest
rates rose from about 22 percent to about 30 percent and have remained at that level since
then.
In Argentina, the pace of economic growth remains strong but has slowed
slightly, with real GDP in the first quarter growing at nearly 7 percent. Industrial
production grew 4.8 percent in May (SAAR), a noticeable slowing from the high growthIV-33

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
rates seen in the previous two quarters. Inflation is low, with 12-month consumer price
inflation in May remaining at slightly over 1 percent. Although import growth slowed in
April, external imbalances remain a cause for concern; over the first four months of this
year the trade balance posted a deficit over $5 billion (AR), compared with about $1.5
billion (AR) over the same period a year ago. This widening deficit has led to some loss
of international reserves, which, excluding gold, fell by about 4 percent in May.
Events in Asia continue to influence Argentine financial markets. Since the
beginning of May, the blue-chip Merval stock index has fallen over 20 percent. Although
deposit interest rates have not risen recently, Brady spreads have generally been
increasing, rising by more than 120 basis points since the end of April.

In Venezuela, the recent slump in oil prices continues to hurt the economy.
Unemployment is rising and despite about $3.5 billion cuts in government expenditures,
the considerably larger loss of oil revenue means that the fiscal position is deteriorating.
With the currency already generally regarded as overvalued, fears of devaluation have
risen. The government has been forced to boost interest rates to protect the bolivar; since
the end of April, the loan rate has gone up about 10 percentage points to over 45 percent.
Inflation is also running high; consumer prices rose about 46 percent (AR) in May.
Although, the figures for the overall trade surplus are not yet available for 1998,
indications are that falling oil prices are fast eroding Venezuela's considerable trade
surplus.

In Russia, financial markets came under severe pressure in late May, and there
was widespread speculation that the monetary authorities might be forced to allow the
ruble to depreciate sharply. In part this pressure reflected renewed spillover from Asian
financial market problems, but there were also a number of negative economic
developments in Russia, including the failure of an IMF mission to reach an agreement
with the government that would allow a quarterly disbursement of Fund resources,
reports that tax revenues were running substantially below target, the apparent collapse of
the nineteenth largest Russian commercial bank, the failure of an attempt to privatize
Rosneft, a major oil company, and disruption of rail traffic by coal miners protesting late
wage payments. The central bank moved to defend the ruble by temporarily raising its
key money market intervention rate to 150 percent on May 27. After this move
succeeded in easing pressure on the ruble somewhat, the central bank lowered this rate to
60 percent in early June. Since then, financial markets have remained unsettled,
experiencing occasional bouts of--so far less intense--pressure.
On June 18, the IMF Board announced that it was delaying a vote on release of a
quarterly payment of $670 million under Russia's existing EFF program. The Fund and
the government have been trying to reach agreement on measures to improve the
government's fiscal performance, focusing especially on tightened revenue collection.
Earlier this month, the government had indicated that it intended to reduce 1998 spendingIV-35

Part 2: Recent Developments, June 24, 1998
by about 30 percent from previously planned levels and appointed, Boris Fedorov new
head of the State Tax Service, with a mandate to combat tax avoidance.
There has been much speculation over that past month that additional funds--over
and above the existing EFF arrangement-might be made available to the government,
either from the IMF or through the G-7. Russian officials have recently indicated that
they were seeking at least $10 billion in additional resources. However, so far no
concrete new measures have been announced. Indicating a willingness to increase its use
of the private market as a source of foreign currency resources, the government on June 3
floated a $1.25 billion five-year dollar-denominated Eurobond issue and, on June 18,
issued an additional $2.5 billion of Eurobonds.
There is growing evidence that the high interest rates and reduced business
confidence associated with the financial market pressures of recent months are starting to
have a negative impact on the pace of economic activity, with both real GDP and
industrial production registering 12-month declines in May.
