DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Growth of real GDP slowed sharply in the second quarter; while domestic final
demand remained very strong, inventory investment shifted down markedly and net
exports continued to plummet. The extension of the General Motors strike well into
July has resulted in some soft indicators of activity in the first part of this quarter,
such as motor vehicle sales and factory employment. But, filtering out this noise as
best we can, the economy appears to have retained considerable forward momentum.
Certainly, the labor market has remained extremely tight, enabling workers to capture
sizable real wage gains; with firms having little pricing "leverage," especially in the
goods sector, inflation has remained relatively low, and profits have suffered in the
nonfinancial sector.
Real GDP for 1998:Q2
The BEA issued its initial estimate of second-quarter real GDP growth--1.4 percent, at
an annual rate--on July 31. Since then, new data have pointed to the potential for a
small downward revision of that figure. Revisions to retail sales in May and June
point to just a touch lower level of personal consumption expenditures. Incoming data

and an estimate of 15-year-old wage and salary workers. To improve comparability over time, household data also are adjusted for several
factors concerning census extrapolations, CPS redesign, and changes in data construction techniques. (Due to insufficient information, however, data
prior to January 1997 have not been adjusted for the most recent methodologtcal change.)

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
on construction put in place suggest a lower estimate for state and local construction
spending, while information on equipment purchases argues for an upward revision to
business fixed investment. The inventory report for wholesale trade came in
considerably weaker than the BEA had assumed; together, the manufacturing and
wholesale inventory data suggest that inventory investment could be revised down
enough to knock a quarter point off GDP growth, all else equal. Tomorrow, the
release of the June report on retail stocks will enable us to refine that estimate for the
Greenbook Supplement.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand continued to expand at a robust pace in July. On a published basis,
total nonfarm payroll employment rose 66,000, and the unemployment rate was
unchanged at 4.5 percent. These figures, however, were distorted by strikes at GM;
and we believe that absent the strikes, payroll gains probably would have been on the
order of a quarter million in July--in line with the pace of employment growth
recorded during the first half of the year--and the unemployment rate probably would
have ticked down to 4.4 percent.1
The effects of the GM strike were most evident in manufacturing, where the decline
in the motor vehicle and parts industry alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the
176,000 drop in payroll employment. In contrast, construction added 18,000 jobs in
July, about in line with the average in the first half of the year. Retail trade posted an
unusually large gain of 125,000 last month, led by a big increase in jobs at eating and
drinking establishments. Finance, insurance, and real estate and transportation,
communications, and utilities also recorded strong gains. Job growth in services
slowed dramatically in July; some of the slowing reflected a drop in temporary help
jobs related to the GM strike, but employment in health and education services also
posted rare declines.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls--which was not noticeably affected by the GM strike--held steady at 34.6
1. GM and the United Automobile Workers (UAW) settled two local strikes at key parts plants in
Flint, Michigan, on July 29. The strikes halted nearly all of GM's North American production and
caused many outside parts suppliers to curtail their operations. Based on notations by individual
respondents to the payroll survey, the BLS estimates that the strike subtracted 141,000 from payrolls in
July. The BLS cautions, however, that they may have missed some secondary layoffs. Our assessment
is that a realistic estimate of the total effect would be closer to 200,000. In the household survey,
workers who are laid off because of strikes are counted as unemployed, while--in contrast to the payroll
survey--strikers are still counted as employed.11-4

hours in July. The index of aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers
rose 0.3 percent, a little above its average monthly increase during the second quarter.
Excluding the estimated effects of the GM strike, aggregate hours were up about 1/2
percent in July, to a level about 2-1/2 percent (annual rate) above the second-quarter
average.
In the household survey, employment growth (adjusted for changes in methodology)
has slowed from 216,000 per month over the second half of 1997 to 127,000 per
month in the first half of 1998. In contrast, growth in payrolls has moderated
considerably less, from 293,000 per month over the second half of 1997 to 245,000
per month in the first half of this year. This divergence could be interpreted as an
indicator that labor inputs have not been rising as rapidly as the payroll survey
suggests. However, the discrepancy between employment growth in the household and
payroll surveys is not a recent development; it has been apparent through most of the
1990s and is largely unexplained even after the usual reconciliations have been made
between the concepts of employment measured by the two surveys.2
Other indicators of labor market activity continue to point to tight labor markets and
ample job opportunities. In late July and early August, initial claims for
unemployment insurance were back down to the low levels that prevailed before the
GM strike. The National Federation of Independent Businesses reported a record
31 percent of firms had difficulty in filling jobs in June. Similarly, the Conference
Board's index of help-wanted advertising held steady in June at a level near the top
end of the range recorded over the past several years. The Conference Board also
reported that the percentage of households believing jobs are "hard to get" remained at
a very low level in July, whereas the percentage reporting jobs are "plentiful" was still
quite high.
Industrial Production
(The industrial production report for July will be released tomorrow and will be
discussed in the Greenbook Supplement.)
2. The household employment data can be made to more closely match the payroll survey concept
by subtracting farm workers, the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and workers in private
households, and adding an estimate of multiple-job-holding and an estimate of workers younger than age
16. A small portion of the discrepancy between the adjusted household series and payroll employment
may be due to an undercount of illegal immigrants. The employment data in the household survey are
based on the responses of a sample of residences, which are then weighted to match Census Bureau
estimates of the population as a whole. Thus, if growth in the population of illegal immigrants is being
understated, household employment growth will be underestimated as well. Indeed, the discrepancy
between employment growth from the two surveys appears largest in the states with the highest
proportion of illegal immigrants.

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
Incoming indicators of current and prospective industrial production remain soft on
the whole. Production worker hours in the industrial sector fell 1.7 percent in July;
although most of this decline was attributable to the GM strike, hours were down
somewhat even abstracting from the strike. Meanwhile, over the past several months,
the percentage of manufacturers reporting increasing orders in the National Association
of Purchasing Management (NAPM) survey barely edged out the percentage reporting
decreases. The staff's estimate for real adjusted durable orders also advanced only a
bit in the second quarter. Among the few upbeat indicators is the new orders index
from Dun & Bradstreet, which has remained at a high level.
Manufacturing output excluding motor vehicles and parts grew sluggishly in the
first half of the year. Among durables, relative to the second half of 1997, the
production of civilian aircraft has leveled off, the high technology industries as a
whole have posted less impressive gains, and production has declined in the primary
metals, furniture, and the stone, glass and clay industries. The output of many
nondurable products also has decelerated, especially chemicals and textiles.
The Asian crisis and the strengthening of the dollar clearly have contributed to this
slowdown. In the NAPM survey for manufacturing, the percentage of respondents
reporting decreases in export orders in July further exceeded the percentage reporting
increases. The August Beige Book and other anecdotal reports from equipment
producers (industrial, construction, and high technology equipment) again cite reduced
exports to Asia and increased foreign competition as factors damping domestic output.
This situation also applies to more basic industries: In the chemical, paper, furniture,
and primary metal industries, net exports deteriorated in the first five months of this
year, production slowed, and stocks increased.
Motor Vehicles
The strikes by UAW workers at two GM parts facilities brought assemblies at GM to
a virtual halt between late June and the last week in July. The staff estimates that
assemblies were held down by 2.1 million units at an annual rate in June, a figure that
likely lowered industrial production growth by almost 1 percentage point and reduced
second-quarter real GDP growth by a bit more than 1/2 percentage point (annualII-8

rate).3 Production in July was depressed by nearly 3-3/4 million units at an annual
rate, which likely held IP growth down by roughly an additional 1 percentage point
that month.

Sales of light vehicles soared in June to 16.9 million units at an annual rate--
the highest level in more than a decade. The strong sales reflected the generous
incentive programs in place during the second quarter, especially the "coupon"
programs of the Big Three. The expiration of those programs explains some of the
sharp drop in sales to a 13.8 million unit pace in July. Supply shortages at GM--
where inventories fell dramatically in June and somewhat further in July--likely also
played an important part in the sales weakness. The shortages led GM to limit fleet
sales sharply in July (the company has agreements with major fleet customers that
allow them to divert cars to retail customers during periods of short supplies), but
even so, shortages crimped retail sales substantially last month.
3. The production loss of 2.1 million units reflects the difference between GM's actual June
assemblies and our expectation prior to the strike-which had assumed a small underbuild relative to
announced schedules. The GDP effect was calculated by multiplying the lost assemblies for June by the
average price of all light vehicles ($15,200 in 1992 dollars) and converting to an annual rate for the
quarter. The resulting $10.6 billion loss corresponds to a reduction of about 0.6 percentage point
(annual rate) in the growth of real GDP. This figure is at the low end of the range suggested by BEA in
the advance NIPA release for the second quarter. The BEA estimates incorporated a somewhat larger
production loss (2.3 million units) than we did because they compared actual production to announced
schedules. In addition, BEA appears to have assumed that more of the losses were in high-value
medium and heavy trucks, which seems to us at odds with GM's actual truck production in June.

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Limited supplies are likely to constrain sales again in August. Production at
GM is not expected to return to pre-strike levels until later this month, leaving their
dealers short of vehicles, probably through the summer. Moreover, the demand for
light vehicles is still strong. Manufacturers' incentives remain favorable this quarter,
and despite its low inventories, GM reportedly is attempting to boost showroom traffic
with aggressive pricing. Consumer attitudes toward new vehicle purchases also
remained positive in July as reported in both the Conference Board survey and the
Michigan Survey.
GM plays a somewhat less important role in the medium and heavy truck
market, and sales and production of these vehicles have not been so severely disrupted
by the recent strikes. In the second quarter, sales rose to the highest level in twenty-
five years. While the pace of new orders has slowed a bit recently, the backlog of
orders continues to rise, suggesting continued strength in the coming months.
Consumption and Personal Income
Real consumer spending posted another huge gain in the second quarter, and the
limited data available for the beginning of the third quarter point to a further
substantial advance other than for motor vehicles. Moreover, the fundamentals
continue to be extremely favorable: Real disposable income has maintained its solid
uptrend; household net worth has risen substantially this year; and consumer sentiment
remains buoyant.
Nominal sales in the retail control category, which excludes spending at
automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, increased 0.4 percent in
July. Nominal outlays rose in all major categories, with the largest gains at furniture
stores and apparel outlets. Even with the plunge in unit sales of light motor vehicles,
the level of real consumer spending on goods in July is estimated to have been
0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter average, not at an annual rate.
The most recent data on services show a 0.4 percent increase in real spending
in June, putting growth for the second quarter as a whole at a 4.8 percent annual rate.
The unseasonably warm weather in June led to a step-up in spending on energy
services in that month. Expenditures in all major categories of non-energy services
were up in June, with the largest gains in outlays for recreation, household operation,
and transportation. The scraps of information available for July are mixed. Outlays
for energy services will likely edge down because average temperatures were not so
far above seasonal norms as in June, but expenditures on personal business services in
July should be boosted by the jump in stock market volume.II-11

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
Household income continues to trend up at a good clip. Real disposable
personal income rose only a small amount in June, but the average for the second
quarter was about 3 percent above its first-quarter level (annual rate). Most
components of personal income posted solid gains in the second quarter. The labor
market data for July point to moderate growth in wages and salaries in that month,
despite a drag from the GM strike.
Growth in personal income has remained substantial this year, but it has been
outpaced by the rapid expansion of consumption, leading to a further large decline in
the personal saving rate. The personal saving rate stood at 0.6 percent in the second
quarter of 1998--down from an annual average of 2.1 percent in 1997.4 However,
trends in the personal saving rate may be an imperfect guide to the net change in
households' resources, as the NIPA concept of personal income contains only a portion
of capital income. Changes in the treatment of capital income can greatly affect
measured personal saving, a point that was underscored in the annual revision to the
NIPA, in which a large part of the dramatic shaving of the personal saving rate is
attributable to an accounting change in the treatment of capital gains distributions by
mutual funds.
Economic theory suggests that, if households recognize that they ultimately
own the business sector, then the retained earnings of corporations should be attributed
to the household sector. A measure of household saving based on personal income
augmented by retained earnings also has declined in recent quarters, but the drop is
less pronounced than that in the NIPA personal saving rate. Moreover, this broader
measure of saving was unaffected by the change in the treatment of mutual fund
distributions mentioned above.
One factor boosting consumption in excess of income growth is the further
substantial gain in household wealth.5 A second, although obviously not entirely
independent, factor has been households' very positive attitudes about personal
financial situations and the economy more generally. Both the Michigan SRC index
of consumer sentiment and the Conference Board index of consumer confidence
4. The large tax payments last April did not distort the quarterly patterns of disposable personal
income and personal saving because BEA's standard practice is to spread such increases over the entire
year. Indeed, when preliminary estimates of the national accounts for the first quarter of 1998 were
released in late May, they showed substantially upward-revised figures for first-quarter tax payments.
5. Econometric models suggest that every additional dollar of stock market wealth leads to a
permanent rise in the level of consumption of between 0 and 6 cents, with the adjustment occurring over
several years. Our preferred estimate of the effect is roughly 3 cents; this did not change when we re-
estimated the relationship using the revised NIPA data.II-14

remained in extremely favorable ranges in July; nearly all components of these two
indexes have been hovering near record levels since last year. One notable finding
comes from questions not included in the overall indexes: The Michigan subindexes of
willingness to fund large purchases using savings and using credit appear to have
trended up since last year.
Housing Markets
Activity in the single-family housing market remained strong in the second quarter.
Low mortgage interest rates, expanding real income, and increased financial wealth
continued to bolster the demand for single-family homes, and initial readings for July
suggested that the robust pace was maintained through midsummer.
Starts of single-family homes rose to a 1.24 million unit annual rate during
the second quarter, only a hair below the strong, first-quarter pace. New home sales
set a series record in June, and the second-quarter average was the highest of any
quarter in thirty-five years. Although existing home sales have edged down from their
record pace in March, their average in the second quarter exceeded any previous
quarter since the beginning of this series in 1968. Sales strengthened further in early
July, according to a survey of builders, and applications for mortgages to finance
home purchases remained at a very high level throughout last month. Reflecting the
large volume of home purchases in recent years, the home ownership rate averaged a
record 66 percent in the first half of 1998.
Strong sales also have kept the inventory of unsold new homes at a low level.
The number of new homes on the market in June was about the same as in other
recent months. However, with sales booming, the ratio of inventories to sales declined
to 3.7 months, the lowest level on record.
Despite the low inventories and strong demand, the prices of new homes rose
only moderately in the second quarter. The nominal constant-quality price of new
homes increased 1.1 percent, year over year, a lower rate than in the preceding four
quarters. These published data appear to be at odds with the strong demand and with
anecdotal reports of rapidly rising land prices. Moreover, increases in prices for
existing homes--as measured by the repeat-sales price index--have been running aboutII-16

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
5 percent from a year earlier.6 We would expect the new home price series to
rebound shortly.
Multifamily housing starts declined 3-1/4 percent in the second quarter, and the
vacancy rate for multifamily rental units, measured on a year-over-year basis, edged
up for the first time in a year and a half. Nevertheless, residential rent in the CPI
continued to rise in real terms through June, and there are no signs of any fundamental
weakening of demand in this sector.
Business Fixed Investment
On our estimate, real business fixed investment increased at an annual rate of
14 percent in the second quarter after soaring at a 22-1/4 percent pace in the first
quarter, when real outlays for producers' durable equipment posted their strongest
quarterly increase since 1983.
Real business purchases of office and computing equipment in the second
quarter rose at nearly a 60 percent annual rate. Rapid growth in real computer outlays
seems likely to continue, but less dramatic price declines could begin to take some
steam out of increases in demand. DRAM prices have flattened recently, and
downstream in the PC market, inventories are down and there are signs that prices are
falling less rapidly. Real outlays for communications equipment rose at a 19 percent
annual rate in the second quarter. Orders for communications equipment have run
above shipments so far this year, providing some momentum for expenditures in the
current quarter. Furthermore, the huge demand for networks to transmit voice, data,
and video likely will continue to lift spending in this sector for some time to come.
We now estimate that real business spending on aircraft was a bit higher in the
second quarter than it was in the first, in contrast to the decline embedded in the
advance GDP number.7 Though the value of civilian aircraft shipments was lower last
quarter, more of the demand came from domestic customers. Boeing is continuing to
6. The various house price series differ in their content and construction. The constant-quality new
home price index uses a regression model to determine the current value of a fixed set of new house
characteristics, such as floor space and geographic location. Existing home prices reflect the gradual
turnover of the large, geographically diverse stock of existing homes. The existing-homes repeat-sales
price index is based on a comparison of prices for the same property at two or more different times.
These repeat-sales prices include any change in value owing to home improvements, and the repeat-sales
sample excludes homes priced above Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitization limits (currently
$227,150).
7. The Census Bureau's Current Industrial Report on aircraft for June--released August 7--points to
higher total aircraft shipments for the quarter than the BEA had assumed; for given aircraft exports, this
implies higher spending by domestic carriers.II-19

ramp up production, and company sources currently expect to meet their ambitious
third-quarter delivery schedules. Nonetheless, deliveries of completed aircraft in July
were below planned shipments.
Outside of information technology and transportation equipment, real
expenditures on capital goods rose at a 10-1/4 percent annual rate in the second
quarter. This strength was manifest despite fairly weak growth in shipments of these
items by U.S. producers, a combination that reflects sluggish demand from abroad and
elevated purchases by domestic customers of favorably priced imported equipment.
This pattern is likely to continue.
In contrast to the strength in equipment spending, expenditures on
nonresidential structures have been weak this year. The annual revision to the data on
construction put in place included a significant drop in the estimate of first-quarter
spending, and BEA's advance GDP figures showed a similar-sized decline in outlays
during the second quarter. All told, real outlays over the first half of this year fell
nearly 4-3/4 percent at an annual rate.8 Available indicators paint a mixed picture for
future growth in building activity. Smoothing through their large monthly swings,
contracts for construction declined over the first half of the year, particularly for office
buildings and lodging establishments. However, vacancy rates for office buildings
continue to fall and commercial real estate prices have moved up, developments that
suggest some support for activity in these sectors.
Business Inventories
Accumulation of inventories slowed sharply in the second quarter. In the advance
NIPA estimates, real inventories increased nearly $45 billion at an annual rate in the
second quarter, down from the $91 billion pace in the first quarter.9 New data for
June and revisions to the figures for April and May contained in the manufacturing
and wholesale book-value inventory reports released last week suggest perhaps a
$5 billion downward revision to that second-quarter figure. In either case, a decline in
motor vehicle inventories, due in part to the GM strike, is responsible for roughly half
of the swing between the first and second quarters.
8. Construction put in place in June, which was not available for BEA's advance estimate, was only
marginally above BEA's assumption.
9. This $91 billion figure for the first quarter is $15 billion lower than the estimate that was
published before the NIPA annual revisions. Downward adjustments to petroleum products held by
refiners ($6.6 billion) and farm inventories ($3.7 billion) accounted for most of the difference.II-22

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
In book-value terms, manufacturing inventory investment rose $10.4 billion at
an annual rate in June and at an $18.6 billion annual rate in the second quarter. About
two-thirds of the second-quarter increase resulted from increasing stocks of aircraft
and parts, a development related to production problems at Boeing and their
customers' difficulties in finding financing. Excluding this category, a more
pronounced slowdown in inventory accumulation was apparent, with stocks increasing
at a $6.5 billion rate in the second quarter, down from $19.2 billion in the first
quarter. About half of the stepdown was accounted for by electrical machinery. The
inventory-shipments ratio for manufacturing ticked up in the second quarter but
remained toward the high end of the range of the past year and a half.
The book value of wholesale trade inventories excluding motor vehicles
increased at a $7.6 billion annual rate in June. For the second quarter as a whole,
stocks rose at an $11.3 billion pace, about the same rate as during the first quarter.
The second-quarter buildup was largely concentrated in durable goods, particularly
machinery and electrical goods. On balance, stocks held by non-auto wholesalers
moved in line with sales last quarter, and the inventory-sales ratio for this category
held steady.
In the retail sector, real stocks of motor vehicles--which are based on actual
readings through June of cars and trucks on dealers' lots--are estimated to have
dropped $14 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter, reflecting the combined
effects of an incentive-related surge in sales and strike-reduced production. Excluding
motor vehicles, book-value stocks fell at a $6 billion annual rate, on average, in April
and May, after rising at a $20.5 billion rate in the first quarter. In the advance NIPA
estimates, BEA penciled in an accumulation of roughly $5 billion for the yet-to-be
released book-value data for June.
Federal Government
The incoming news on the federal budget has continued to be favorable. The unified
budget recorded a $56 billion budget surplus over the twelve months ending in June,
reflecting robust growth of receipts and modest increases in spending. Receipts in
June were 8-1/2 percent above those of a year earlier as payments on personal income
and social insurance taxes rose 11-1/2 percent over the period, more than twice as fast
as personal income. June corporate income tax receipts, which include estimated
payments for the second quarter, were only 1 percent higher than a year earlier, a pace
consistent with the sluggish growth in corporate profits. June outlays, adjusted for

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
proceeds, were nearly 4 percent above a year earlier, reflecting a surge in spending on
Medicaid and a variety of smaller programs--all inherently volatile series.
Taking a longer perspective, adjusted outlays in the twelve months ending in
June were only 1-1/2 percent higher than during the twelve months ending in June
1997. In the NIPA, real federal consumption and investment rose 7 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter after having declined 9 percent in the first quarter.
The swing largely reflected changes in defense spending.
According to its preliminary update of the Economic and Budget Outlook
released in mid-July, the Congressional Budget Office projects a federal unified budget
surplus of $63 billion in fiscal 1998, at the top of the range it had estimated in early
May.10 Moreover, the CBO lifted its projection of the fiscal 1999 surplus under
current policies to $80 billion. Looking further ahead, the CBO expects that the
surplus will rise to 1-1/2 percent of GDP in 2002 and that the budget excluding social
security will reach balance by that year.
The July CBO economic projections were updated to reflect incoming data and
to incorporate revisions to long-run economic assumptions. Recent developments led
the CBO to boost its projection for real GDP growth this year to 3.3 percent (annual-
average basis) and cut its CPI inflation projection to 1.7 percent. The CBO made only
minor adjustments to its projections for real GDP growth over the longer run, but it
reduced its projections of CPI inflation and long-term real interest rates about
1/4 percentage point in each year. It also reduced its estimate of the NAIRU
0.2 percentage point, to 5.6 percent. All told, the changes in economic assumptions
boost the surplus by $20 billion each year, on average.
A more important factor for the CBO's upward revision to the surplus forecast
was a "technical" revision that lifted revenues between $45 billion and $58 billion
above the levels projected in January. This revision largely reflected the incorporation
of the 1998 receipts surprise and the CBO's assumption that the forces that lifted
revenues this year will continue to boost them by similar dollar amounts in future
years. Projected interest outlays were reduced because of lower borrowing needs and
lower interest rates; the reduction in interest outlays in fiscal 2003, for example, was
$28 billion. In addition, CBO cut its estimate of fiscal 1998 noninterest outlays by
10. CBO made its last complete set of official budget forecasts in January. In that forecast, CBO
projected that the budget surplus would rise to 3/4 percent of GDP in fiscal 2002. In May, the CBO
updated its estimates for fiscal 1998 and 1999 but did not revisit its estimates for beyond 1999. The
May forecast was based on the economic assumptions made in January, but it incorporated budget data
received between January and May.II-29

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
$16 billion, but beyond the current year, revisions to noninterest outlays were quite
small.
State and Local Governments
According to BEA's advance estimate, real consumption plus investment spending by
state and local governments rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, just
matching the increase in the previous quarter but a little below the 2.5 percent average
of the previous three years. All of the increase in the second quarter was in
consumption and equipment expenditures. Real outlays for construction dropped
4 percent at an annual rate last quarter, and the monthly data for June, which became
available after the GDP release, point to a substantial downward revision to this figure.
The state and local surplus of operating accounts appears to have fallen off somewhat
in the second quarter from the record high range seen in recent quarters.11 In July,
state and local employment fell 10,000, with all of the decline in non-education local
government workers.
According to the recent annual survey by the National League of Cities, the
fiscal health of cities as a group continues to improve. The percentage of cities whose
officials think that they are better able to meet their financial needs rose a bit further,
to nearly 70 percent in 1998, the sixth consecutive rise; a low of 20 percent was
recorded in 1992. In 1997 growth in city revenues exceeded growth in outlays, and
the ending balances rose.12 Like the more qualitative indicator noted above, this
measure of city fiscal well-being has moved up steadily since its low in 1992. Cities
ranked spending on public safety and infrastructure high among spending priorities in
1998. The most common revenue actions taken in the past year were increases in
various fees and charges and reductions in property taxes.
Prices
Inflation has remained quiescent. In June, both the overall CPI and the CPI excluding
food and energy ticked up just 0.1 percent. A slight rise in the index for food was
largely offset by a decline in energy prices, while prices of goods excluding food and
energy were unchanged, and nonenergy service prices were up only moderately.
11. The surplus was raised substantially in the annual NIPA revisions largely because of upward
revisions to sales and income taxes and to interest received. The surplus in the second quarter is a staff
estimate, as BEA has not yet published corporate tax collections.
12. Actual revenue and expenditure data are only available through fiscal 1997. For cities, fiscal
years vary and may coincide with the end of the federal fiscal year (September 30), the fiscal year of
most states (June 30), or the calendar year.I-31

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
Consumer food prices increased 0.1 percent in June; prices of fruits and
vegetables moved down after surging in May, and other food prices continued to post
small increases. Over the twelve months ending in June, the CPI for food rose
2.2 percent, down from a 2.6 percent increase in the year-earlier period. The CPI for
energy fell 0.7 percent in June and is down about 6 percent over the past year.
Gasoline prices dropped in June for the eighth time in the last nine months; survey
evidence suggests that gasoline prices at the pump edged up in July but fell back in
early August.
Outside of food and energy, tobacco prices fell 0.6 percent, after large
increases in the previous two months, but remained 10-1/2 percent above their level of
a year earlier. Prices of new motor vehicles fell 0.3 percent for the second month in a
row, likely reflecting the Big-Three coupon incentives. These coupons expired in
early July. This week, GM was reported to be planning a new round of incentives
that appear somewhat more aggressive than the usual end-of-model-year programs.
By contrast, used vehicle prices rose briskly for the third consecutive month in June.
Over the twelve months ending in June, core commodity prices have increased only
0.4 percent, down 1/2 percentage point from the year-earlier period.
Part of the favorable performance of core commodity prices over the past year
reflects the influence of imports--both the direct effect of lower prices for imported
finished goods and the indirect effects of lower materials prices and of more intense
competition for domestically produced goods. While imported goods cannot be
identified in the CPI, we estimate that the share of core consumer goods that are
imported is in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent. Such shares suggest that the
direct effect of falling import prices over the past year has reduced core commodity
price inflation by roughly 1/4 percentage point. In addition, the competition from
imports has contributed to the deceleration in prices of some domestically produced
goods, such as motor vehicles, household appliances, and toys.
Prices of non-energy services rose 0.2 percent in June and have risen
3.1 percent over the twelve months to June, the same pace recorded in the year-earlier
period. Owners' equivalent rent increased 0.2 percent in June, after rising at a
relatively elevated pace in recent months. Among services excluding energy and
shelter, air fares fell for the third consecutive month, while the prices of medical
services accelerated further. Prices for medical care services have risen 3.3 percent
over the past year, after increasing only 2.9 percent during 1997. The acceleration has
been more evident over the past six months, when medical care services rose at a
3-3/4 percent annual rate.II-34

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Other broad measures of inflation also have decelerated over the past year. As
of the second quarter of 1998, four-quarter changes in the chain-weighted price
indexes for GDP and PCE were down about 1 percentage point from their pace a year
earlier. As with the CPI, large declines in energy and non-oil import prices and the
deceleration in food prices have helped hold down PCE inflation over the past year.13
However, core PCE prices have also been held down by changes in the prices of items
that are not included in the CPI. In particular, more than half of the deceleration in
core PCE prices over the past four quarters can be attributed to a large decline in the
rate of change in the index of prices of imputed services provided by commercial
banks to consumers--not included in the CPI--from their very rapid pace in the prior
year.
Capital goods prices have remained soft. The PPI for capital equipment was
unchanged in June and is down 0.6 percent over the past twelve months. This decline
reflects a drop in motor vehicle prices and the unusually large declines in computer
prices that occurred earlier this year--two areas with particularly large import
shares--as well as a deceleration in prices of many other types of capital equipment.
Few signs of inflationary pressure are evident at earlier stages of processing.
The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy edged down again in
June and stood about 1/2 percent below its year-earlier level. The PPI for core crude
materials continued to move lower as well through June. Measures of industrial
commodity prices have been mixed since late June: The Journal of Commerce
industrial price index has increased about 1 percent since then, but the CRB measure
of industrial commodity prices has weakened. Futures prices for farm products are
considerably lower than they were in late June and suggest that the twelve-month
change in farm prices could remain decidedly negative into the early part of next year.
Short-term inflation expectations have backed up lately, on balance, after
having dropped notably in the first few months of the year. According to the
Michigan survey, median inflation expectations for one year ahead were at 2.6 percent
in July--up from 2.3 to 2.4 percent earlier in the year but still a bit below the readings
13. In the recent annual revision, BEA switched from using published CPIs to using "experimental"
geometric-mean CPIs (back to 1995) as the underlying source data for many components of PCE prices.
These geometric-mean CPIs incorporate a greater degree of substitution among items within narrowly
defined expenditure categories. We estimate that the introduction of geometric means held down
increases in PCE prices by about 1/4 percentage point per year starting in 1995. Although BLS will not
incorporate this formula into the CPI until January 1999, it has been preparing experimental geometric-
mean indexes for some time. At the time of the next benchmark revision, BEA is likely to incorporate
the geometric-mean indexes back at least to 1991.II-37

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
that prevailed in the second half of 1997. However, longer-term inflation expectations
have not moved up, as both the Michigan survey's median inflation expectations for
five to ten years ahead and the Philadelphia Fed's survey of professional forecasters'
ten-year-ahead expectations remain well below 3 percent.
Labor Costs
The Employment Cost Index for hourly compensation of private industry workers
increased at an annual rate of 3.6 percent over the three months ending in June, after
having risen 2.7 percent in the first quarter and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of
1997. On a twelve-month basis, hourly compensation in the ECI accelerated
0.6 percentage point over the past year, from 2.9 percent in June 1997 to 3.5 percent
in June 1998.
Although its weight in the index is only about 7 percent, more than half of the
pickup in total private hourly compensation between June 1997 and June 1998 resulted
from a 4-1/2 percentage point acceleration in compensation in the finance, insurance,
and real estate industry (FIRE). Bonuses and commissions for these workers have
been boosted, in part, by the wave of mortgage refinancing in recent quarters. In
addition, the transportation, communications, and public utilities grouping of industries
showed a 1.5 percentage point acceleration, mainly reflecting a large pickup in the
compensation of communications workers. Among other industries, increases in
compensation in construction and services picked up only slightly over the past year,
while compensation gains held fairly steady in manufacturing and trade. Among
occupations, the acceleration in compensation over the past year was greatest for
white-collar workers, especially sales workers, a category that includes many workers
paid commissions and bonuses. Because these types of pay are highly variable and do
not make their way into base wages, such increases could be reversed if demand were
to soften.
The acceleration in compensation costs over the past twelve months was
evident in both wages and salaries and in benefits. Wages and salaries rose
4.0 percent over the twelve months ended in June--0.7 percentage point faster than
over the preceding twelve months. FIRE accounted for about half of the acceleration.
Although benefits rose only 2.6 percent over the past twelve months, this rate of
increase was 0.6 percentage point higher than during the preceding twelve-month
period. More than half of the acceleration in benefits resulted from the pickup in
employer costs for health insurance, which rose 2.6 percent over the past year
compared with just 0.7 percent over the previous period. As we have noted before,II-38

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
anecdotal reports indicate that a further acceleration in health insurance costs may be
in the offing over the coming year. Among the other components of benefits, larger
increases in the costs of supplemental pay (including bonuses and wage differentials
for overtime and late shifts) and paid leave (which essentially moves in tandem with
wages and salaries) were partially offset by a slower rise in costs for pensions,
workers' compensation, and state unemployment insurance. Pension costs benefited
from rising stock prices, which reduced the size of employers' contributions necessary
to maintain required levels of funding, while the strength of the economy over the past
couple of years has reduced the tax rates faced by employers to fund unemployment
insurance.
Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector--as measured in the BLS's
Productivity and Cost release--rose at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, down from its 4.6 percent rate of increase in the first quarter.14 Over the past
four quarters, compensation per hour increased 4.3 percent, up from the previous
year's reading of 3.4 percent. On a year-over-year basis, this measure of
compensation per hour has risen more rapidly than the ECI since late 1995, following
a two-year period in which the relationship was reversed. Although the two measures
tend to move together over long periods, the Productivity and Cost series tends to be
more cyclically variable than the ECI. Conceptually, compensation per hour can vary
because of changes in the amount of overtime being worked and changes in the mix
of industries and occupations of workers, while the ECI attempts to hold these factors
fixed. 5
Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector edged down 0.2 percent at an
annual rate in the second quarter. But given earlier strong advances, productivity was
up 1.9 percent over the past year. Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector
increased 2.4 percent between the second quarter of 1997 and the second quarter of
1998, about the same pace as over the previous four-quarter period.
In July, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on
private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.2 percent and were up 4.2 percent over the past twelve
months. Abstracting from the GM strike would add about 0.1 percentage point to
each of these figures, putting the twelve-month change about where it has been since
April.
14. With this release, the Productivity and Cost data were corrected for the length-of-pay-period
problem discussed in detail in the May Greenbook.
15. In addition, the ECI measures changes in compensation for particular jobs. If companies have
reacted to the scarcity of workers by promoting people to higher-level jobs without raising their pay to
the averages for those positions, then the ECI would measure a reduction in wage rates even though
aggregate wages had risen.II-43

Appendix
The Annual Revision to the NIPA
On July 31, the BEA published its regular annual revision to the national income and product
accounts. Data on the spending side of the accounts were revised back through 1995; because
of some definitional changes, some income series were revised back through 1982. As usual,
the revision incorporated more comprehensive source data, including Census annual surveys of
manufacturing (for 1995 and 1996), wholesale and retail trade (1995-96), services (1995-97),
and state and local governments (1995-97), unemployment insurance records (1997),
tabulations of tax returns (1996), and revised construction and balance of payments statistics
(1995-97).
In addition, some changes were made in the way certain components of GDP are measured.
Most important, many categories of consumer spending are now being adjusted for inflation
with geometric-mean consumer price indexes. These price indexes assume a unitary elasticity
of substitution within narrow product groups and generally show smaller increases in recent
years than the regular CPIs.' The BEA also incorporated new source data for estimating
consumer spending on cellular phone and internet services, motor vehicle leasing, light trucks,
financial services, and gambling. In addition, some changes were made in the sources and
methods used to estimate petroleum and natural gas drilling. Furthermore, the source data
underlying the NIPA estimates of aircraft exports are now being seasonally adjusted, which
may ameliorate the "residual seasonality" problem in exports--although that is not entirely
clear.
Revisions to GDP and its Components
On average, the annual rate of growth in real GDP was revised up 0.3 percentage point over
the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the first quarter of this year. The largest
revisions to growth were in 1995 and 1996--0.5 and 0.7 percentage point respectively--while
real GDP growth in 1997 was revised up just 0.1 percentage point.
Annual real PCE growth is now 0.4 percentage point higher, on average, than before, with
most of the revision reflecting the new price indexes. Notably, the new source data did not
substantially alter the estimates for telecommunications services from BEA's earlier, less
sophisticated estimates. Among other components of final sales, the new measures for
drilling boosted growth rates for nonresidential construction, and more comprehensive source
data resulted in an upward adjustment to state and local outlays.
On balance, changes to the estimates of inventories were small. Given the upward revisions to
real final sales, however, aggregate inventory-sales ratios measured using chain-weighted
(1992) price data are now lower than previously estimated. Notably, the ratio of inventories
relative to final sales of goods and structures now shows only a small increase since early
1996, as compared with the more noticeable uptrend evident in the earlier data.
1. The BLS will not incorporate these new indexes into the official CPI until next January, and,
even at that time, it will not revise the official CPI back in history.

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
Prices
On average, the annual rate of growth in the chain-type GDP price index was revised down
0.3 percentage point over the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the first quarter of
1998. The largest revisions were in 1995 (0.3 percentage point) and 1996 (0.5 percentage
point); prices in 1997 were revised down just 0.1 percentage point. Much of the slowing was
in PCE prices reflected the switch to the geometric-mean CPIs.
Income-Side Developments
The large and widening gap between the product and income sides of the national accounts
was reduced somewhat with this revision. The difference between nominal gross domestic
product and nominal gross domestic income--the statistical discrepancy--still shows a decline
into negative territory during the past couple of years, but not as much as previously. The
statistical discrepancy was revised down (in absolute value) in 1997 by $30 billion, or 0.4
percent of GDP. The revision owed to a higher estimate of nominal spending that reflected
the sum of small upward revisions to PCE goods, fixed investment, and exports; in contrast,
gross domestic income was revised little.2
The most dramatic change in this year's revision was to the personal saving rate, which is now
considerably lower than previously estimated. Much of this change is traceable to a
redefinition of personal dividend income that no longer includes capital gains distributions by
mutual funds (which are not income from current production). All of the series affected by
this redefinition were revised back to 1982. The largest revisions to the saving rate were in
the most recent years, because of the greater popularity of mutual funds and the strong
advances in the stock market, which resulted in substantial capital gains distributions. Over
the past three years, the saving rate also was revised down because of lower estimates of some
components of disposable personal income--namely, other labor income (largely pensions,
profit sharing, and group insurance), social insurance contributions, and net interest. All told,
the revised estimates indicate that the personal saving rate fell from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 1.2
percent the first quarter of 1998, as compared with the previously published drop from 4.2
percent to 3.6 percent.
While the change in the treatment of capital gains distributions resulted in a reduction in
personal income and saving, there was a corresponding increase in the estimate of
undistributed corporate profits. Consequently, national saving was unaffected by this
definitional change; other revisions had only a modest effect on the national saving rate.
Elsewhere, the annual revisions resulted in relatively small changes to the estimates of
corporate profits and labor's share of gross national income.
2. In its press release, the BEA noted that this year's annual revisions were largely to the
expenditure, or product, side of the accounts and reflected mainly the availability of new or revised
source data. They are working on longer-term projects to address problems in the income estimates,
such as the inclusion of capital gains in the source data on wages and salaries and the separation of
domestic from foreign-source income in corporate profits. This work will be incorporated into
subsequent annual and benchmark revisions.II-A-2

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments, Appendix II-A-3
BLS Annual Revisions to Productivity
On August 11, the BLS released updated estimates of productivity, which incorporate the new
GDP data as well as the annual revision to the payroll employment survey released in June.
The data also have been corrected for the length-of-pay-period problem we have discussed in
previous Greenbooks. The new figures show that output per hour in the nonfarm business
sector rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate between the fourth quarter of 1994 and the first quarter
of this year. Over this period, the average annual growth rate in productivity was boosted 0.3
percentage point, reflecting upward revisions of 0.4 percentage point to growth in nonfarm
business output 0.1 percentage point to growth in hours worked. The staff estimates that the
new PCE prices accounted for about 1/4 percentage point of the upward revision to growth in
nonfarm business output.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Most interest rates have fallen somewhat, on balance, since the July FOMC meeting.
Market participants have primarily focused their attention on developments in Asia,
but concerns have deepened as well about Russia and Latin America. The growing
pessimism came to a head again in the past week or so, causing the dollar to
appreciate further and yields on nominal Treasury securities to drop. The prospect of
weaker export markets has added to the fears that corporate earnings might continue tc
fall well short of earlier expectations, and the major equity price indexes have dropped
about 4 percent to 11 percent since the Committee's last meeting. Looking ahead,
monetary policy is widely viewed as being on hold in the near term; the Chairman's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last month was said to have signaled a greater wariness
about inflation risks and less emphasis on the negative impulse from Asia than many
observers had expected, but no hints of a predilection toward early tightening. In the
past few days, as turmoil in foreign financial markets has deepened, some market
participants, albeit a small minority, have begun to talk about the next policy move
being an ease.
Private sector borrowing weakened a bit in the second quarter, but it remained
heavy. Corporations issued new bonds at roughly the same pace as in first quarter. In
July, investment-grade issuance picked up, with much of the proceeds being used to
fund merger and acquisition activity, but below-investment-grade issuance fell off as
the market became a bit more cautious in response to growing concerns about
earnings. Household debt growth slowed some in the second quarter, as the growth of
consumer credit downshifted. Households continue to substitute mortgage debt for
higher-cost consumer credit.
Meanwhile, the favorable budget position enabled the U.S. Treasury to continue
to pay down its marketable debt, with cuts concentrated in bills and short-dated
coupon securities. State and local government borrowing also has slowed recently
from the brisk pace earlier in the year.
Bank credit growth moderated in July from its second-quarter pace. Bank loan
growth was modest, in part reflecting the use of proceeds from corporate bond
issuance to fund business loans. Loan standards and terms have changed little since
May, according to respondents on the August Senior Loan Officer Survey. The
expansion in bank credit was apparently financed by heavier use of sources outside of
M3. As a consequence, M3 was about unchanged in July, its weakest monthly

performance in four years, while M2 growth decelerated a bit. Still, both aggregates
remain well above the upper bounds of their annual ranges.
Business Finance
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations slowed only slightly in July from
the exceptional pace of previous months. The heavy financing activity of investment-
grade corporations about offset a pullback by speculative-grade borrowers (table).
Companies used the bulk of proceeds from the bond sales in July to fund new merger
and acquisition activity and for general corporate purposes, but they continued to
devote some proceeds to refinancing both higher-rate bonds as well as shorter-maturity
bank loans and commercial paper. The July pattern extended into early August, when
WorldCom sold a record $6 billion of investment-grade debt to finance its merger with
MCI. The market remains receptive to bond offerings, like this one, from firms with
favorable earnings prospects. Investors were also attracted by the large issue size of
the WorldCom offering, which suggested greater trading liquidity.
Gross offerings of speculative-grade debt, particularly in the private-placement
(Rule 144A) market, slowed further in July after reaching record levels in the spring.
The share of total issuance accounted for by speculative-grade bonds dropped to about
a third in July, from a little less than half in the first half of the year (chart, bottom-
left panel). The recent slowing appears to reflect a greater degree of investor caution.
This less complacent attitude toward risk likely stems from generally less favorable
earnings prospects and recent increases in default rates on speculative-grade securities
(chart, bottom-right panel). Yield spreads on speculative-grade issues in early August
were about 80 basis points above their March lows-but still on the small side by
historical standards.
Other measures of credit quality remain favorable. Moody's upgraded, on net, a
large volume of corporate bonds in the second quarter, a development that primarily
reflected a reassessment of debt issued by General Motors and Chrysler, and its
Watchlist suggests only a small net downgrade in coming months. Through July, the
rate of business failures stood at its lowest level in a decade.
Gross equity issuance was robust in June but dropped off sharply in July
(table). A number of companies involved in mergers and acquisitions sold stock in
June to raise cash. As stock prices fell through July, investors appeared to beIII-3

approaching offerings by most companies more cautiously, with the exception of
Internet-related firms, and the volume of initial public offerings slipped.
Net equity issuance continued to contract as merger-related share retirements
climbed to near-record levels. Retirements associated with completed megamergers
(those valued in excess of $1 billion) contributed to the uptick (chart, top left), but
smaller mergers continued to account for a sizable share of equity retirements. Like
larger deals, the smaller deals have proliferated into all sectors, and most have been
friendly and have involved intra-industry combinations. Announcements of share
buybacks by nonfinancial companies slowed in the second quarter, but previously
announced programs will likely result in close-to-record repurchases this year.
Equity prices went on a roller-coaster ride over the intermeeting period. Paced
by large-capitalization stocks, most major share price indexes soared to record highs in
early July. Investors were relieved when the first batch of second-quarter earnings
reports generally exceeded downward-revised projections. However, sentiment
reversed after several major firms warned that earnings would fall short of projections
in the second half of 1998 and after the Chairman commented on unrealistic earnings
expectations during the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings. Prices tumbled in August when
earnings worries intensified as the prospects for recovery and reform in Asia and
emerging market economies elsewhere eroded further. Despite little in the way of bad
earnings news for small-capitalization firms, the Russell 2000 index did not rally with
the other indexes in early July, and this index continued its pattern of failing to keep
pace with other market measures (chart, top right). Since its peak in April, it has
dropped about 17 percent, raising the likelihood of a fourth-straight year in which this
index underperforms the rest of the market by at least 10 percentage points.
Most second-quarter earnings reports are in hand, and the four-quarter growth
rate of S&P 500 earnings per share apparently edged up (chart, bottom left). Growth
in financial-sector earnings was again very robust, owing to large profits from
investment banking activities at brokerage firms and money center banks and higher
fee income for commercial banks generally. Growth in profits of nonfinancial firms
picked up only slightly, as contractions in earnings in the technology and energy
sectors continued to be drags. In addition, almost all of the downward revisions to
year-ahead earnings projections for the S&P 500 during the past several months were
accounted for by revisions to projections for those two sectors (chart, bottom right).

growth of 5-1/2 percent, down from 7-1/2 percent at the time of the last Greenbook.
Projections for 1999 earnings were trimmed by somewhat less; as a result, implied
growth was boosted.
Household Sector Finance
Household balance sheets strengthened further in the second quarter, as rising equity
prices lifted asset levels by more than the rise in debt. The ratio of household net
worth to income is estimated to have edged up to another record high in that quarter
(chart). Estimates suggest that declines in equity prices in recent weeks have trimmed
estimated net worth positions only slightly, leaving them well above fourth-quarter
levels.
Household debt continued to rise faster than disposable personal income in the
second quarter, expanding at an estimated 7 percent annual rate (table). Mortgage
borrowing remained brisk, fueled by exceptionally strong home sales and heavy
mortgage refinancing, often involving liquification of accumulated equity and likely
some continued substitution of mortgage loans for consumer debt. Consumer credit
grew at only a 3-1/4 percent annual rate in the quarter, as revolving credit growth
dropped sharply.
Recently released data on household credit quality have been favorable. Auto
finance companies reported that delinquencies in June stayed well below the first
quarter rate (chart). Moody's reported that the credit card delinquency rate registered
its seventh straight monthly decline in June, to a level just below 5 percent and near
the midpoint of its range over the past decade.
On the asset side, households in the second quarter continued to invest in stock
and bond mutual funds at a brisk pace, with net new flows into long-term mutual
funds averaging $28-1/2 billion at a monthly rate (table). Inflows to such mutual
funds in total are estimated to have remained steady in July, although the composition
shifted some toward bond funds and away from equity funds. Moreover, preliminary
data, provided by the Investment Company Institute on a confidential basis, indicate
that net inflows to equity funds dried up in the latter part of July and early August,
when stock prices declined (table).III-7

Households have continued to redeem shares of mutual funds that specialize in
emerging market equities, a trend that began in the middle of last year (chart).
Whereas earlier the net outflows were centered in funds that specialized in Asian or
Latin American companies, regionally diversified funds have also experienced net
redemptions in recent months.
Federal Government Finance
In July, the Treasury began to implement its plan to shift the supply of securities
toward shorter maturities and to concentrate its note sales in fewer maturities to
maintain their liquidity. It trimmed the number and size of longer-term coupon
offerings, eliminated the three-year note, and augmented the amount of Treasury bills
and shorter-dated coupons. The two-year note offering was enlarged by $3 billion in
July. Further increases in auction sizes, however, have been delayed because strong
tax inflows have resulted in smaller-than-expected financing needs. We expect bill
auction sizes to rise in the second half of August, and by the end of the third quarter
the total offering size of the weekly bill auctions should be $2 billion larger than their
current $13 billion. A further $1 billion increase in the size of the two-year note
auctions is projected by the end of this quarter. At its August midquarter refunding,
the Treasury sold $16 billion of five-year notes-the first offering of a five-year note at
the quarterly frequency and an amount that was substantially larger than the $10-1/2
billion offered at the last monthly auction.
One factor prompting a reconfiguration of nominal Treasury issuance is
expanded offerings of inflation-protected securities (TIPS). In July, the Treasury
reopened the thirty-year TIPS that it had originally offered in April and sold an
additional $8.4 billion, bringing the total amount of this issue outstanding to $16.9
billion. With a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.3, the demand for this bond was solid, but less
so than in April. The Treasury also announced that it will sell a ten-year indexed note
in October. Yields on TIPS rose over the intermeeting period and remain high relative
to yields in other countries that have indexed debt outstanding.
In August, the Treasury cut the minimum purchase amounts for Treasury bills
and two-year notes to $1,000, from $10,000 and $5,000, respectively. With issuance
tilted more toward shorter maturities, the Treasury sought to make these offerings
more accessible to the small investor. In addition, starting in September, investors
who are Treasury Direct customers will be able to purchase securities over the InternetIII-9

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
and, beginning in October, using a touch-tone phone. On September 1, the Treasury
will begin sales of inflation-indexed savings bonds.
Gross issuance by government-sponsored enterprises in July and early August
featured additional offerings of Fannie Mae's "benchmark" and Freddie Mac's
"reference" notes, some of which were reopenings of outstanding issues. Both
agencies are seeking to take advantage of the decline in Treasury issuance to establish
these noncallable notes as issues that can be used for hedging, short sales, and duration
management. Demand from investors, especially from overseas, has been quite strong.
The extra liquidity associated with sales of these notes should reduce borrowing costs
for the agencies. Indeed, recent yields on these types of notes were about 1-1/2 to 3
basis points lower than those on nonbenchmark agency securities.
Municipal Finance
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds dropped off from the high June level but
remained substantial in July. Issuance to raise new capital, which had been boosted in
June by offerings in the health and transportation areas, eased only slightly. A dropoff
of refunding issues in July, with interest rates still at fairly low levels, suggests that a
good portion of the stock of higher-rate outstanding debt may have been refinanced.
The market has had some difficulty absorbing all of the new supply of tax-
exempts. The ratio of yields on revenue bonds to Treasury yields is at a three-year
high. Investor demand has not kept pace with issuance, as manifested by short bid
lists and large dealer inventories of unsold bonds. Although flows into municipal bond
funds have picked up this year, they have not kept pace with net issuance. In addition,
property and casualty firms, which are usually large buyers of municipal securities,
reportedly have trimmed purchases as heavy claims payouts have reduced their
investible funds.
Credit quality in the state and local sector continued to improve over the
intermeeting period. The upgrade of the debt of New York City, which covered $27
billion of bonds, more than offset the modest volume of debt downgraded.1
Money and Bank Credit
Bank credit grew at an annual rate near 5 percent in July, after adjusting for mark-to-
market accounting effects, as banks boosted their securities holdings. Bank loan
growth eased, primarily reflecting a smaller increase in business loans. The supply of

Domestic Financial Developments
business loans in recent quarters has been affected by a pullback in lending by
branches and agencies of foreign banks. The August Senior Loan Officer Survey
showed that a significant share of branches and agencies continued to raise spreads
and in response to higher funding costs and concerns about the financial condition of
their parents. Domestically chartered banks, in contrast, reported little change in their
willingness to make business loans, preserving their accommodative lending posture,
and they noted some slight further easing of terms.
Both the residential and commercial components of real estate loan growth at
banks have been sluggish over the past few months. Consistent with reports of robust
housing and improving commercial property markets, demand for these loans has been
strong, as confirmed by the most recent loan officer survey. Moreover, the survey
indicated that spreads on commercial mortgages had narrowed since May. Reported
growth, however, has been damped by stepped-up securitization at large banks.
Reported consumer loans ran off at a striking 15 percent annual rate in July,
owing to more than $6 billion in securitizations, most of which consisted of credit card
loans from one large bank. After adjusting for securitization, however, these loans
expanded at a moderate 6 percent pace.
While M3 was about flat in July, it was still up 8-1/2 percent at an annual rate
from the fourth quarter of 1997, well above the top of its annual range. A surprisingly
steep runoff in large time deposits in July, following double-digit growth over the first
two quarters of the year, shaved nearly 4 percentage points off the monthly growth
rate. The runoff was concentrated at a handful of U.S. branches and agencies of
European banks, which relied more heavily on non-M3 funding sources, particularly
borrowing from their head offices overseas. Institution-only money market mutual
funds also contracted last month after expanding very briskly over the first half of the
year. Investors sharply reduced their holdings of these funds at times during July to
avail themselves of short-lived increases in the rate spreads on money market
instruments over these funds.
M2 growth in July was a bit slower than in the second quarter, as the
expansion of its liquid components, particularly retail money funds, eased.
Nonetheless, growth of M2 continued to outpace that of nominal GDP in the second
quarter, with velocity declining sharply, at about a 5-1/4 percent annual rate. The
rebenchmarking of GDP raised the level of M2 velocity but had little effect on its
recent pattern of behavior (chart). From the fourth quarter of 1997 through July, M2
expanded at a 7 percent pace, well above the upper bound of its range.III-15

Appendix
The August Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices
The August 1998 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, primarily
covering changes over the past three months, posed the usual questions bearing on the supply
of and demand for bank loans to businesses and households.1 Additional questions targeted
changes in standards and terms on home equity, consumer, and commercial real estate loans,
and the effects of reduced participation of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the
U.S. loan market.
On balance, the domestic respondents do not appear to have significantly changed their lending
posture over recent months. Although the survey provided additional evidence of narrowing of
interest rate spreads for most types of loans, other changes in terms were generally minimal.
The respondents attributed the narrowing of spreads primarily to increased competition from
other banks. Lesser numbers of respondents indicated that nonbank lenders were a source of
greater competition.
In contrast to domestic banks, substantial fractions of the U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks reported tighter credit standards and terms. In special questions addressed to
them, foreign institutions reporting decreased participation in U.S. loan markets indicated that
concerns about their parent's financial condition or increased costs of funds due to the parent's
financial condition were major reasons for the reduced lending activity.
Lending to Businesses
Domestic respondents reported no changes, on net, in standards for commercial and industrial
loans to medium and larger customers, and only 5 percent of respondents, on net, eased
standards for commercial loans to smaller firms. About 15 percent of domestic respondents,
on net, reported narrowing spreads on loans to medium and large firms, down from about
35 percent in May, but twice as many reported trimming spreads on loans to small firms.
Those reporting an easing of credit standards or terms noted more aggressive competition from
banks and, to a lesser extent, nonbank lenders.
About 17 percent of the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, on net, reported tighter
credit standards for commercial and industrial loans; this is down substantially from the past
two surveys. However, large fractions of the branches and agencies continued to tighten
business lending terms, including fees and spreads.
August's survey also included special questions for the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks regarding their commercial and industrial lending over the past year. More than half,
61 percent, of the foreign respondents indicated that this type of lending had slowed at their
institution over the past year. Only one of these gave decreased demand as an important
reason, and only three cited concerns about the credit quality of their customers as a reason.
Instead, all the Japanese institutions attributed their slowdown to a desire to reduce the loans
on their books because of the financial condition of their parent institution or to an increase in
1. This summary of the survey results is based on responses from the complete panel of fifty-seven
domestic banks and twenty-four branches and agencies of foreign banks.

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
funding costs owing to the financial condition of their parent. Among non-Japanese
respondents, three out of five reporters cited "other" reasons for the slowdown. Their
comments indicated that the spreads on these loans have narrowed so much that they are no
longer an attractive investment.
When queried about the effects that the pullback in lending by some U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks has had on loan terms for U.S. firms, respondents provided
contrasting answers depending on their perspective. About 74 percent of the foreign
respondents indicated that the effect was either "moderate" or "substantial." Approximately
40 percent of large domestic banks responded with "moderate" or "substantial" effects.2 By
contrast, only 10 percent of the smaller domestic banks reported a large effect.
A modest portion of the domestic respondents, 9 percent on net, indicated demand for business
loans from larger customers had weakened. This is the first reported decrease since the first
quarter of 1996 and partly reverses the increase in loan demand reported in recent surveys.
Those respondents reporting weaker loan demand pointed to decreased merger or acquisition
activity, decreased customer investment in plant and equipment, and increased funding from
nonbank loan sources as significant reasons for the decreased demand. Increased use of
internally generated funds and decreased inventory financing needs ranked somewhat lower.
Domestic respondents also reported little change, on net, in credit standards for commercial
real estate loans over the last three months, but more than half acknowledged, in special
questions, having narrowed interest rate spreads on these loans over the past year. Again, the
most common reason cited for the narrower spreads was heightened bank competition, with
more aggressive nonbank competition a distant second. A small share of foreign respondents
had tightened credit standards on commercial real estate loans. A large majority, 82 percent of
domestic and 67 percent of foreign, respondents, on net, reported that competing institutions
had eased standards or terms on such loans over the past year.
Lending to Households
A few respondents reported changes in consumer loan standards. On net, 20 percent tightened
standards on credit card loans, and 8 percent tightened standards on other consumer loans.
Both responses represent a slight increase over the previous survey. Despite the tightening of
standards, 10 percent of respondents, on net, expressed greater willingness to make consumer
loans. Most banks reported no changes in credit card terms, although about 10 percent cut the
size of credit lines and increased interest rate spreads on new or existing accounts. Terms on
other consumer loans, which were unchanged on the previous survey, were eased in August:
About a fifth of respondents reported narrower spreads on these loans. The demand for
consumer loans was reported to be essentially unchanged.
Domestic respondents also reported no change in standards for home mortgage loans since
May, but 35 percent, on net, reported increased demand for these loans over the past three
months, likely reflecting the robust housing market and the heavy pace of refinancing activity.
In special questions, about 10 percent of respondents, on net, reported having eased lending
standards and terms on home equity loans over the past six months. Their responses suggested
little change in demand for these loans over that period. Those respondents reporting
increased demand for home equity loans gave consolidation of other loans as the primary
2. Large domestic banks, in this context, are domestic banks with assets exceeding $15 billion.III-A-2

Domestic Financial Developments, Appendix III-A-3
reason, while those reporting decreased demand gave refinancing of mortgages as the primary
reason.
Special questions were asked about the impact of changes in consumer lending standards and
terms over the past two years on both loan volume and current terms. Exactly half of the
responding banks reported that tighter standards have had a "minimal" or "moderate" effect on
the volume of their consumer lending, and 10 percent indicated there had been virtually no
effect. About a third of the respondents indicated that they had tightened terms on more than
half of their credit card accounts; the majority of banks, however, indicated that only a fairly
small share of their credit card accounts had been affected by these changes.

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services
In May, the U.S. nominal trade deficit in goods and services widened to $15.7
billion, the largest deficit since the series on monthly goods and services was first
published in January 1992. For April-May combined (AR), the deficit was substantially
larger than in the first quarter. NIPA real net exports fell sharply in the second quarter,
yielding a negative contribution to real GDP growth of 2 1/2 percentage points. Trade data
for June will be released on August 18.

The value of exports declined 1 1/4 percent in May with much of the decrease in
automotive products, machinery, and agricultural products. Exports to most key countries
in Asia continued to decline in May. For April-May combined (AR), the value of exports
of goods and services was 2 1/2 percent lower than in the first quarter. More than three-
fourths of the decline was in capital goods (nearly half from aircraft) and agricultural
products. There was also a sharp decline in exports of automotive products to countries
other than Canada and Mexico. Overall, exports declined to all major areas except
Canada; the largest decreases were to Western Europe and Asia.
The value of imports rose one-half percent in May with the increase spread among
all major trade categories except oil and consumer goods (both of which declined). For
April-May combined (AR), the value of imports was 1 1/2 percent higher than in the first
quarter. Half of the increase was from consumer goods. There were also sharp rises in
imports of aircraft and steel. Imports of semiconductors fell.

Oil imports and prices. The quantity of imported oil declined only slightly in
May from high rates in April, and for April-May on average the quantity of imported oil
was 12 percent higher than in the first quarter. The strong level of imports primarily
reflected an acceleration in stockbuilding and surprisingly strong consumption.
Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports remained strong in
June and July, although below the April-May average, as stockbuilding continued and oil
consumption moved back toward more usual rates.
The price of imported oil fell 31 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter,
about half the rate of decline recorded in the first quarter. The import price rose slightly
in April and May following cuts in production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and
dropped significantly in June and July. After trading in a range of $14.75 to $16.50 per
barrel during April and May, the spot price for WTI plunged during June following
reports of surprisingly high levels of oil stocks and a sharp downward revision in
estimates of Asian oil consumption during the first quarter of 1998 Q1. In July, spot WTI
rebounded on news of further cuts in production by major oil producers; prices traded in a
range of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel until early this week, when spot prices dropped
below $13 per barrel before rising above $13.50 toward the end of the week.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. In 1998 Q2, prices of non-oil imports
declined just over 3 1/2 percent at an annual rate, with decreases recorded for all major
trade categories (particularly computers, semiconductors, other capital goods, industrial
supplies, and consumer goods). The price of "core" imports decreased about 2 percent at
an annual rate, slightly less than in the first quarter. In July, prices of U.S. non-oil
imports declined 0.5 percent, the largest drop since January. For the second consecutive
month, prices of non-oil industrial supplies dropped 1 percent; similarly large monthly
rates of decline were recorded last December, January and February. Prices of
semiconductors also dropped sharply for the second consecutive month; prices of
computers also declined. Prices of other capital goods decreased slightly faster than in
recent months. Prices of imported consumer goods edged down for the second
consecutive month, and prices of imported automotive products were unchanged in July
following a slight decrease in the second quarter.
Prices of agricultural exports (BLS) fell 7 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter, about one-half the rate recorded in the first quarter. The price ofnonagricultural
exports declined 3 percent at an annual rate. There were notable declines in prices of
exported industrial supplies and consumer goods, as well as computers and
semiconductors. On the other hand, prices of other exported capital goods wereIV-4

unchanged and prices of exported automotive products rose. The price of "core" exports
declined 2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, slightly less than in the first
quarter. In July, prices of nonagricultural exports returned to the average monthly rate of
decline recorded during the first five months of the year (0.2 percent) following an
unusually sharp decrease in June. In July, the effect of notable decreases in prices of
exported industrial supplies (particularly oil, chemicals, and metals) was muted in overall
measures of export prices by the small size of changes in other categories of trade. Prices
of agricultural exports rose 0.2 percent in July, the third consecutive month without
declines.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners were $96.5 billion in the
second quarter of 1998, up $20 billion over the first quarter (Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table, line 4). The $20 billion gain was more than accounted
for by a swing of net private purchases of Treasury obligations from the unusual net sales
recorded in the first quarter (line 4a). The shift in private net purchases of Treasuries
from the first quarter to the second quarter was mostly accounted for by the large and
volatile transactions of Caribbean financial centers. These large net purchases,
concentrated in the Treasury bond and note markets, may reflect waning concern about a
possible hike in U.S. interest rates. Japanese residents also contributed to this swing.
After three quarters of recorded net sales, residents of Japan recorded $6 billion in net
purchases of Treasuries in the second quarter, concentrated in April. In June, Japanese
residents again sold Treasuries on net. In the rest of Asia, there were small net private
purchases of Treasuries in the second quarter.
Net purchases of corporate and other bonds by private foreigners remained very
strong in the second quarter (line 4b), owing to a high level of new Eurobond issues by
U.S. corporations and government agencies. Agency securities accounted for about one-
third of these net purchases. Net purchases of U.S. stocks also remained strong (line 4c),
but far below the torrid pace of the first quarter.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities, primarily from Europe and Latin
America, strengthened in the second quarter (line 5). In the same period, there were net
sales of Japanese bonds and stocks. There was some pickup in stock purchases of other
Asian economies in May and June, after net sales in April.
Foreign official assets held in the United States decreased by $10 billion in the
second quarter (line 1). The outflow was more than accounted for by China, Japan,
Singapore, Thailand, Spain, and Switzerland.IV-6

A net capital inflow was recorded through private banking transactions in the
second quarter on a month-end basis (line 3). The net inflow was particularly large in
June, more than reversing the net outflow recorded in May.
Foreign Exchange Markets
Between the June-July FOMC meeting and mid-August, the foreign exchange
value of the dollar rose 2 percent on a weighted average basis against other major
currencies (formerly, the narrow index). With respect to individual currencies, the dollar
rose against the yen, the Canadian dollar, and sterling, but declined against the mark and
other European currencies.
The dollar's overall rise was led by an appreciation of more than 4 3/4 percent
against the yen, as investors viewed the prospects for fiscal stimulus and financial reform
in Japan to have faded further during the period. Japan's bridge bank proposal failed to
spur market enthusiasm, and doubts remained about how aggressively banks would be
closed or merged. The new LDP government appeared to be offering little new by way of
fiscal policy stimulus, with the economic program of the new administration containing
to a great extent proposals that are merely a repackaging of elements put forth by the
previous administration. Statements made in late July by Finance Minister Miyazawa,
who seemed to indicate less interest in conducting official intervention operations to
support the yen than had been present in the previous administration, also prompted some
yen selling. Furthermore, data releases during the period, particularly on employment,
continued to show weak or weakening activity. The yield on the Japanese bellwether
government bond declined 15 basis points, and equity prices declined more than 2 3/4
percent.
The dollar rose 3 percent against the Canadian dollar, as market sentiment toward
Canadian assets soured. The yield on the ten-year Canadian government bond rose about
20 basis points during the period, even as the yield on the comparable U.S. Treasury
security edged down on balance and other G-10 bond yields declined. Equity prices in
Canada fell nearly 12 percent.
.The three-month rate on
Canadian finance paper rose almost 15 basis points during the period.IV-8

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
The dollar rose more than 2 1/2 percent against the U.K. pound during the period.
Data releases showing a weakening in economic activity and the consequent unwinding
of expectations for an imminent rate hike by the Bank of England contributed to
sterling's decline. The shift in expectations prompted declines in U.K. interest rates
across the maturity spectrum.
Confidence in the successful implementation of Stage III of European Economic
and Monetary Union may have increased further during the period. The dollar moved
down 1 percent against the mark and other euro-area currencies, and long-term bond
yields in the region continued to decline, despite news that economic activity appears to
be resuming at a healthy pace after a pause in the second quarter. The convergence of
short-term interest rates also progressed, with the three-month market interest rate in Italy
down another 20 basis points during the period, bringing it to less than 140 basis points
of the comparable German rate.
Against a trade-weighted average of the currencies of selected emerging market
and newly industrializing economies, the dollar also firmed about 1/2 percent, as declines
of 11 percent against the Indonesian rupiah and 2 1/2 percent against the Korean won were
offset by increases of 1 to 4 1/4 percent against a number of other Asian and Latin
American currencies.IV-10

International Developments
The rupiah was supported by an increase of nearly 10 percentage points in the
one-month domestic interest rate in Indonesia. Over the same period, equity prices in
Indonesia declined more than 9 1/2 percent. Short-term interest rates moved higher in
Hong Kong also. Pressures on the Hong Kong dollar developed as concern about the
absence of new policy initiatives in Japan prompted speculation that China may choose to
devalue the renminbi, taking the Hong Kong dollar with it. As a consequence, the one-
month interest rate in Hong Kong moved up 2 percentage points during the period. The
higher interest rates, data showing unemployment at a 15-year high, and poor earnings
reports sent the Hang Seng stock price index down 22 percent.
In contrast, short-term interest rates in Korea and most of the rest of Asia moved
lower, as authorities sought to place more emphasis on providing liquidity and less on
maintaining currency values. Only in Korea, however, did the easier monetary conditions
correspond to a firming in equity prices, which were up 1 percent during the period.
Share prices elsewhere in Asia declined, particularly in Malaysia and the Philippines.
Contributing to the declines were dimming prospects for Japan, poor corporate earnings
reports, downgrades by major ratings agencies of the credit ratings of government and
private debt in several Asian economies, and uncertainty about the advisability of softer
monetary policy stances. Moody's announcement that it was putting Japan's Aaa
sovereign credit rating on review for a possible downgrade also seemed to rattle the
neighboring Asian markets.IV-11

International Developments
The Mexican peso declined nearly 2 1/2 percent on balance against the dollar during
the period. The downward pressure on the peso prompted the Bank of Mexico to tighten
its monetary policy stance on August 10, which drove the one-month interest rate up
about 200 basis points from its level immediately preceding the move. (From the
beginning of the intermeeting period on June 30, the one-month interest rate showed a net
decline, in part reflecting end-of-month and perhaps end-of-quarter money market
pressures.) Mexican equity prices declined almost 17 percent.
Asset prices in Russia continued to be pressured, with the ruble falling beyond the
limits of its daily band near the end of the period. Russian authorities countered with an
announcement on August 12 of the imposition of limitations on domestic banks'
purchases of foreign exchange. The announcement of these controls boosted ruble-
denominated short-term government bill rates very sharply, with quotes rising as much as
140 percentage points on the morning of August 13. The one-month interbank deposit
rate ended the intermeeting period up about 1 percentage point, and the yield spread of
Russian Brady-style debt over U.S. Treasury securities rose 9 percentage points. Russian
equity prices moved down more than 33 percent.
The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the
Treasury.
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available data on second-quarter real economic activity indicate that the Japanese
economy contracted sharply for a second consecutive quarter, due to an implosion of
business fixed investment and a contraction in household consumption. In contrast, real
GDP appears to have expanded in the major European economies during the second
quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the first three months of 1998. In most of the
European economies, current indicators suggest that strong domestic demand continues to
offset relatively poor external performance due to the Asian economic crisis. In contrast,
in Canada, domestic as well as foreign demand seems to have slowed from its earlier
rapid pace.
Inflationary pressures in most foreign industrial countries remain subdued. One
exception is the United Kingdom, where consumer price inflation still remains slightly
above the government's 2 1/2 percent target.
Individual country notes. In Japan, economic indicators for the second quarter
suggest significant weakness in economic activity. Industrial production during the
second quarter dropped 5.3 percent (not annualized) from the first-quarter average,IV-13

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
notwithstanding a modest rebound in June. Similarly, total machinery orders during the
second quarter were down almost 6.5 percent from their already weak first-quarter pace.
Labor market conditions have continued to deteriorate in recent months, with the
unemployment rate in June rising to a post-war high and the offers-to-applicants ratio
falling to its weakest level in twenty years. Labor market uncertainty appears to be
weighing heavily on the household sector, where expenditures fell further during the
second quarter and auto registrations continued to decline. In July, the level of consumer
prices (net of the September increases in co-payments under the National Health
Insurance System) was down about 1/2 percent from the year-earlier level.

Japan's trade surplus during the first half of the year was $106 billion at an annual
rate, well above the $83 billion surplus registered in all of 1997. Exports during the first
six months (valued in dollars) were 7 1/2 percent below their 1997 average, while imports
dropped a sizable 16 percent. The weakness in exports primarily reflects the impact of
the Asian crisis; exports to Korea, Thailand and Indonesia are all down sharply from a
year earlier. However, exports to the United States and particularly the European UnionIV-14

International Developments
continue to register strong gains. The sharp drop in Japanese imports is due largely to the
ongoing contraction in Japanese private domestic demand.
On July 2, the LDP announced a new financial sector restructuring plan. A
principal component of the new plan is the establishment of "bridge banks," which would
run insolvent banks until the failed banks were merged, sold or liquidated. The bridge
bank plan should help ensure that sound borrowers of failed institutions continue to have
access to credit. The LDP announcement also included measures to strengthen the
Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company, which buys bad assets from solvent banks, and
a commitment to dispose aggressively of bad loans held by the government-owned
Resolution and Collection Bank. In addition, the LDP called for improved transparency
by requiring all banks to report according to "SEC-equivalent" standards, promised an
intensive inspection of the nineteen largest banks, and pledged stricter conditionality
when public funds are injected into live institutions (including sacking senior
management and penalizing shareholders). These measures appear to represent a step
forward, but it remains to be seen whether--in practice-the Japanese authorities will
actually move decisively to address the financial sector's problems. (The legislation
necessary to implement these proposals is being considered in a special Diet session that
began on July 30 and is expected to run through early October.)
In Japan's upper-house elections held on July 12, the LDP won only 45 of the 126
seats that were contested. (The LDP entered the election holding 61 of these seats and
needed 69 seats to gain a majority in the upper house.) In response to this rebuff, Prime
Minister Hashimoto resigned and was replaced by Keizo Obuchi, who had been
Hashimoto's foreign minister. Obuchi appointed former Prime Minister Miyazawa as his
finance minister and has promised to implement economic reforms, including financial
sector restructuring and permanent tax cuts.
Real economic activity in the eleven countries scheduled to enter European
Monetary Union next year appears to have continued to expand in the second quarter,
although at a slower pace than in the first quarter. Partial data suggests that industrial
production rose, while both business and consumer confidence remained high. The
average unemployment rates continued to fall in most countries, and consumer price
inflation remained low across the EMU area.IV-15

Real GDP growth in Germany is estimated to have dropped back during the
second quarter to less than 1 percent at an annual rate from its 3.9 percent pace in the first
quarter. Industrial production, after surging in the first quarter, declined 1 percent in the
second quarter due primarily to a sharp decline in construction. Production excluding
construction fell only slightly in the second quarter. However, total employment rose and
capacity utilization remained above 87 percent in the second quarter, its highest level
since 1991.' Anecdotal reports indicate that the service sector of the economy was
relatively strong in the second quarter.
The second-quarter slowdown appears to owe to several temporary factors that
shifted growth into the first quarter. First, the increase in the value-added tax by 1
percentage point (to 16 percent) that took effect at the beginning of April shifted
consumption expenditure from the second quarter into the first quarter. Second,
unusually warm winter weather boosted construction output in the first quarter. Despite
the second-quarter slowdown, the German economy appears to be on firm footing. The
1. A significant fraction of this year's decline in unemployment of 250,000 persons (s.a.) owes to
schemes that have been re-introduced in the eastern states. In 1997, such schemes were phased-out,
resulting in job losses of more than 200,000 in the five states in eastern Germany. The re-introduction of
employment programs-including government creation of jobs as well as subsidization and vocational
training-is estimated to account for more than one-half of the decline in unemployment this year.IV-16

International Developments IV-17
long-awaited rebound in the domestic economy materialized in the fourth quarter of last
year and picked up steam in the first quarter, while net exports made a negative
contribution to growth in both quarters (primarily reflecting a surge in imports).
Forward-looking indicators are somewhat mixed. Real manufacturing orders
were roughly unchanged in the second quarter from their level in the first quarter, and the
IFO business confidence survey, which combines current and expected conditions in the
manufacturing, retail, wholesale, and construction sectors edged back in the second
quarter, but remains at a very high level.
Consumer price inflation remains quiescent According to preliminary data for
the four largest states in western Germany, inflation dropped in July to 0.9 percent from
1.1 percent in June (on a 12-month basis). The drop in July reflects the ending of the
transitory effects on the 12-month inflation rate of a revision to the CPI basket in July
1997.

In France, available second-quarter data suggest that domestic demand has
remained firm. In April and May, industrial production was up about one percent from
its first-quarter average. Consistent with strong second-quarter business confidence,
production of capital and semi-finished goods rose. Although auto sales in April were

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
down slightly, retail sales at large stores were strong, and consumption of manufactured
products increased one percent for the quarter as a whole. The quarterly unemployment
rate dipped below 12 percent for the first time since the last quarter of 1995. Third-
quarter monthly indicators are limited but they point to continued strength in economic
activity. In July, consumer sentiment and business confidence remained high and stable,
and businesses expected marked improvement in near term production. Consumer price
inflation remains stable at record lows.

details will not be available until October when the budget proposal will be presented to
parliament.) The plan targets a 2.3 percent central government budget deficit, down from
3 percent this year. However, as in 1998, the government expects to rely on the business
cycle for the targeted improvement. In fact, the current budget plan sets a one percent
real increase in government spending in order to "boost employment and preserve
economic recovery." Overall tax rates are set to decline modestly (due to reductions in
some marginal VAT rates), while wealth and capital gains taxes will not be raised,
despite such proposals from the left.

a whole, consumer confidence rose to reach its highest level since the third quarter of
1990, but business sentiment and industrial production dropped. Related manufacturing
data continued to show the negative impact of the phase out of the tax-incentive on new
auto purchases as well as that of weaker Asian demand for textile and leather goods.
Third-quarter data are scant In July, consumer confidence declined although it remained
above its first-quarter average.
Inflation, which dipped below two percent (year/year) in April 1997, remains low
and stable. In July, consumer price inflation was 1.8 percent, unchanged from June and
its second-quarter average.

On July 22, prime minister Prodi narrowly survived a confidence vote in the
lower house of the parliament (where the government relies on the support of the
Communist Refoundation Party (CR) for an absolute majority). The vote was prompted
by CR's refusal to back NATO expansion into Eastern Europe, and the government was
bailed out in the last minute by the supporting votes of a small party in the opposing
center-right coalition. The latest row is indicative of more political turmoil in the fall
when the government will attempt to produce a 1999 budget acceptable to business, the
trade unions, and the communists.

In the United Kingdom, economic activity continued to expand at a moderate
pace in the second quarter. The preliminary estimate showed real GDP growth of 2
percent, little changed from the rate in the first quarter. Growth in service sector output
slowed from 3 percent to 2.3 percent, and the average volume of retail sales grew at its
slowest quarterly rate in two years. Industrial production expanded 1.0 percent in the
quarter, with manufacturing output little changed. Recent survey data suggest that the
outlook for manufacturing industries deteriorated further over the summer. Business
confidence has declined to its lowest levels since 1992, reflecting a negative outlook for
both export and domestic orders.
Conditions in the labor market remain tight and continue to put pressure on
wages. The official claimant unemployment rate remained above 4 1/2 percent in July, and
average annual earnings growth was 5 percent in May. Retail price inflation remains
somewhat above the 2 1/2 percent target; the twelve-month rate of British retail price
inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) was 2.8 percent in June.

International Developments
above the 2 1/2 percent target for most of the forecast period, but then to fall back so that
by the third quarter of 2000 it is "close to the 2 1/2 percent target." The August inflation
outlook includes a more inflationary contribution from labor market tightness, reflecting
the acceleration in earnings that has occurred since May, and less restraint from import
prices.
In Canada, recent data indicate a slowing of growth. GDP at factor cost edged
down 0.2 percent in May after remaining flat in April, the first time in over two years that
the economy has failed to grow for two consecutive months. Manufacturing output
continued to decline in May, hurt by reduced demand from Asia. In contrast to recent
months, the service sector showed some weakness as well.
Canadian employment has declined on balance since April, after a year and a half
of strong growth during which job gains averaged more than 30,000 a month. The GM
strike accounted for about 15, 000 persons on temporary layoff in Ontario over the June-
July period. The Canadian unemployment rate has remained at 8.4 percent since April, as
the labor force has declined in line with the drop in employment.
Canada's trade surplus rebounded to $1.2 billion in May, up from $0.8 billion in
April. Imports of machinery and equipment declined, suggesting a slowing in the pace of
investment. In contrast, imports of consumer goods remained strong. Exports to Japan
rebounded somewhat from their sharp fall in April but were still 19 percent lower than a
year ago.
Canadian core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, fell 0.1 percent
in June from the previous month. The only sign of inflation related to the falling
Canadian dollar was a 0.7 percent rise in food prices. Relative to a year earlier, the core
CPI was up 1.0 percent in June. With inflation at the bottom of its 1 to 3 percent target
range, and with some weakening in recent data on economic activity, the Bank of Canada
has resisted raising interest rates in the face of a Canadian dollar that has continued to set
new lows versus the U.S. dollar.IV-21

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
Economic Situation in Other Countries
In most emerging market economies, economic activity has either been weak
(especially in Korea and the ASEAN region) or has slowed. In Russia, the very high
interest rates needed to defend the ruble, along with heightened uncertainties, have
depressed economic activity. In Brazil, activity picked up in the second quarter, but
disappointing economic news in July and August prompted economic stimulus measures.
The general adjustment toward surpluses in external balances in Asia continued.
In Latin America, external balances continued to deteriorate, except in Brazil, where the
trade balance has narrowed relative to last year.
Progress on economic reform has been mixed. Efforts are underway in several
Asian economies to address banking problems. Korea announced it would close five
undercapitalized banks and prevent banks from extending credit to non-viable firms. The
Brazilian government sold its controlling stake in Telebras in July, but its large fiscal and
external imbalances continue to fuel concerns that a devaluation is needed. Russia has
initiated a broad array of fiscal measures, but more may be required.
Individual country notes. In Korea, activity weakened further in the second
quarter. Industrial production in the second quarter was nearly 12 percent below its year-
earlier levels, compared with a decline of about 8 percent in the first quarter. The
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 7.7 percent in June, over three times the
rate in June of last year. The continued fall in activity prompted the government to
announce expansionary fiscal measures, including programs designed to add 500,000
additionaljobs. The added spending and tax reductions-adopted with the support of the
IMF-are expected to raise this year's government budget deficit to 4 percent of GDP
(compared with a 1.7 percent deficit rate envisioned in the original IMF agreement).
There have been sporadic but intense outbreaks of labor unrest over proposed layoffs,
most prominently at a Hyundai automobile factory, which is attempting to institute the
first layoffs under legislation enacted in February allowing employers to make workforce
reductions.
Korea's trade surplus increased to $42 billion (annual rate) in the first six months
of the year. This rise represents a positive swing of $55 billion from the $13 billion
deficit (annual rate) recorded in the corresponding period last year. The won appreciated
by about 10 percent against the dollar in July before falling back partially in recent
weeks. The appreciation of the won caused some observers (including an IMF official) to
express concerns that further won appreciation might begin to reverse some of the trade
adjustment achieved since the financial crisis of last fall. The won's strength, along withIV-26

International Developments
the weakness of activity, led the monetary authorities to lower interest rates further,
moving the overnight rate down to below 11 percent
The government has taken additional measures to restructure the financial sector
in recent months. At the end of June, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
announced that five under-capitalized banks "whose rehabilitation plans were deemed not
feasible" would be closed and their assets and liabilities transferred to five healthier
banks. Seven other under-capitalized banks were allowed to remain open but told to
submit new rehabilitation plans to the FSC by the end of July. The government also
released a list of 55 non-banking firms-including units of the five big chaebols
(conglomerates)-that were declared to be non-viable. The firms on the list are to be cut
off from all new credit lines and are to enter into proceedings for liquidation or third-
party takeover. Finally, in early August, the activities of four life insurance companies
were suspended on account of financial shortfalls.

Consumer prices, particularly for food, continued to accelerate in Indonesia, in
part because of low inventories (reflecting distributors' reluctance to boost them to
normal levels) and because the sharp drop in the currency has boosted the prices of traded
goods. Elsewhere increases in inflation were moderated by weakening domestic demand.

Trade surpluses widened further in most of the ASEAN countries in May,
reflecting the impacts of currency depreciation and sharp declines in domestic demand.
Although outpaced in most cases by falling imports, export revenues also declined
because of declines in dollar export prices, difficulties in securing credit, a slowdown in
global demand for electronics, and a region-wide container shortage.IV-28

The implementation of economic reforms varied across the ASEAN region.
Indonesia's revised 1998-99 budget reinstated many subsidies for food and fuel to
mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the poor. The IMF acquiesced to this policy
change, and on July 15 boosted the stand-by program by $1.3 billion as part of a new
multilateral $6 billion package to help Indonesia fund its budget gap. In late July, the
Consultative Group for Indonesia3 pledged an additional $7.9 billion for the same
purpose. In August, Indonesia and creditor banks agreed to reschedule $2.6 billion in
fixed interbank loans that mature on or before March 1999.4
Elsewhere, Malaysia established a bank recapitalization agency, but plans to raise
$2 billion for that purpose in international debt markets were shelved after Moody's and
S&P lowered Malaysia's sovereign rating in late July. In his first state of the nation
speech, Philippine President Estrada promised to quicken the pace of privatization and
launch an anti-corruption campaign. Singapore formed a task force on asset
securitization to develop means for firms to raise funds. In early August, Thailand
floated a proposal to guarantee the minimum value of foreign investors' future equity
infusions into Thai banks; industry analysts dismissed the proposal as insufficient to
attract capital into the banking industry.
In Hong Kong, GDP fell 12.3 percent in the first quarter (SAAR).
Unemployment continued to rise, reaching 4.5 percent in the second quarter. Hong

In Mexico, economic activity has begun to show signs of decelerating. Industrial
production in May was 6 percent above its year-earlier level, which is lower than the
recent trend excluding March/April--the period covering the holy week. The slowdown
was evident in the construction sector, which has been hard hit by the public sector
budget cuts and reduction in government spending on investment. A broader deceleration
of activity is anticipated early in the second half of the year as a result of the GM strike.

pressures and volatility in the foreign exchange market prompted the Bank of Mexico to
tighten monetary policy in late June and again in early August. In early July, the
government announced its third budget cut this year of 9 billion pesos (approximately
$1.1 billion) in response to falling oil prices and the consequent loss of government
revenue. Nonetheless, events in Asia and their reverberations in international financial
markets during the past week have caused sharp declines in the peso and stock market,

industrial production in June was about the same as in October 1997, just before the
central bank's overnight interest rate was doubled to over 40 percent to defend the
currency, the real. Unemployment dropped in June, but the drop reflected mainly a fall
in the number of people looking for work. Unemployment in May was at its highest level
since records were first kept in the early 1980s. High unemployment plus disappointing
news about sales in July and early August prompted the government to enact labor
reforms and several stimulative measures. The consumer price index fell in July,
bringing year-over-year inflation to 4 percent.

On July 29, the Brazilian government sold its controlling stake in Telebras for
$19 billion, about 60 percent above its asking price. The government indicated that it
would use the proceeds of the sale to retire maturing debt, although President Cardoso
also indicated that some money would be spent. (Purchasers of Telebras were required toIV-32

pay 40 percent of the price of the firms in cash, and the rest in installments over the next
couple of years.) Strong interest in the auction was probably boosted by President
Cardoso's improved election poll ratings in recent weeks; Cardoso will make his second
bid for the presidency in early October, and most observers now expect that he will be
reelected in the first round vote. The success of the Telebras auction probably
encouraged the central bank's monetary policy committee to reduce its overnight lending
rate from 21 percent to 19.7 percent that night (at its regularly scheduled meeting).
Although stock prices rose by about 7 percent over the two days following the
Telebras auction, prices since then fell precipitously in response to the problems in
Russia and Asia, as well as concern that fiscal and external trends remain incompatible
with the government's commitment to limit the depreciation of the real. The fiscal and
current account deficits total roughly 7 percent of GDP and 3 1/2 percent of GDP,
respectively, and many observers believe that the real is overvalued.
In Argentina, the pace of economic growth has slowed somewhat compared with
the very impressive rates recorded last year. The growth of industrial production slowed
to 5.1 percent (SA) in the second quarter over the same period a year ago and the
unemployment rate fell only slightly to 13.2 percent in the May survey from the last
survey conducted in October 1997. Inflation continued to be low; 12-month consumer
price inflation in July was slightly over 1 percent. Import growth slowed to 8 1/2 percent
in Q2 over a year ago, compared with a growth rate of nearly 14 percent in the first
quarter. Nevertheless, the cumulative trade deficit through June this year was $3.5 billion
(AR) compared to a $1 billion deficit (AR) the same period a year ago. The Argentine
government met its fiscal targets for the first half of the year agreed upon with the IMF.
The government has also announced further spending cuts of about $1 billion for 1998.
President Menem announced in late July that he will not ask Congress to change
the law to enable him to seek a third term in office. The announcement halted an
unpopular campaign that had threatened to split his Peronist party.IV-33

The Venezuelan economy continues to be plagued by low world oil prices, high
interest rates, and political uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the December
presidential elections. Faced with substantial oil price declines and oil production cuts
resulting from their OPEC commitments, government officials have acknowledged that
the oil sector, and the economy as a whole, will contract this year. Oil accounts for about
a third of total output, half of government revenues, and three-fourths of exports. Loss of
oil revenues have forced major cutbacks in oil investment and raised the government's
forecast for the 1998 public sector deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP.
In July, consumer prices rose 38 percent (twelve-month inflation rate), forcing the
government to revise upward its 1998 inflation target from 28 percent to 32 percent.
Despite high inflation, the government has not allowed the bolivar to depreciate much,
creating currency pressures that have led to very sharp increases in interest rates; the loan
rate has risen by about 20 percentage points since end-June to about 60 percent, far
outpacing inflation. Oil exports were hit hard, with the trade surplus through April this
year coming in at a little over $8 billion (AR), compared with nearly $13 billion (AR)
over the same period a year ago.IV-34

In Russia, a financial crisis erupted beginning in early July. The main underlying
market concern was the worsening fiscal situation, involving falling tax revenues,
mounting payment arrears, and escalating interest payments on government debt. The
focus of immediate market concern was that dwindling foreign exchange reserves would
prove inadequate to defend the ruble, which might be forced to depreciate sharply. The
central bank raised its money market intervention rate to 80 percent to support the ruble,
but market rates surged even higher, moving above 120 percent.
In response to those developments, on July 13, the IMF and World Bank
announced that an agreement had been reached that would make substantial funds
available to Russia. A total of $22.6 billion was to be provided in the remainder of this
year and next year, of which $15.1 billion would come from the IMF, $6 billion from the
World Bank, and $1.5 billion from Japan. In return for this support, the Russian
government agreed to implement immediately new fiscal measures to increase
government revenues by about 3 percent of GDP. In the week following the
announcement of the IMF support package, about two-thirds of these promised measures
were enacted, either through passage by the parliament or through Presidential degree.
However, because of the failure to enact all of the measures, on July 20 the IMF
Executive Board voted to reduce by $800 million (to $4.8 billion) the amount that would
be immediately released to the Russian government.
In conjunction with the initiation of the support package, Russian authorities
indicated that they planned to take measures to extend the maturity of, and reduce the
interest costs on, the government's debt. As a first step in this direction, on July 20, it
was announced that holders of short-term ruble-denominated Russian Treasury bills

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 13, 1998
worth $4.4 billion (slightly over 10 percent of the total amount outstanding) had agreed to
exchange these bills for 7-year and 20-year dollar-denominated bonds.
Financial markets initially reacted favorably to the announcement of the support
package, with the ruble firming, stock prices rising over 10 percent, and market interest
rates dropping roughly in half to around 60 percent. However, this initial positive
reaction subsequently has been entirely reversed on concerns that promised reform might
not be fully implemented and because of adverse spillovers from Japanese and Asian
emerging market turmoil. On August 13, stock prices fell 10 percent, short-term treasury
bill rates soared to above 200 percent, and the ruble traded well outside its daily trading
range set by the central bank. The central bank reacted to this pressure on the ruble and
what it termed "a crisis of liquidity" in the banking system by imposing limits on banks'
foreign exchange purchases and expanding banks' access to overnight credit.
In recent months it has become increasingly apparent that the high interest rates
and economic uncertainty generated by the financial turmoil that has prevailed much of
this year is having a depressing effect on the pace of activity. By June, output had fallen
about 2 percent below its year-earlier level, and Finance Minister Zadorov recently
indicated that he expected output to shrink by up to 1 percent this year and at best to
stagnate next year. The most positive macroeconomic development has been the
continued decline in inflation, with consumer prices rising less than 5 percent in the 12
months to July.
