text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
As the third quarter draws to a close, the U.S. economy appears to be expanding
moderately. As a result of reduced export demand and rising import competition,
activity in the industrial sector has stagnated and the pace of factory job losses has
quickened. But domestic final demand to date has remained strong, sustaining hefty
employment gains in the construction and service sectors. The unemployment rate has
remained low, and anecdotal reports of sizable wage increases are heard with some
frequency. However, the available aggregate data on pay inflation suggest at most a
modest upcreep, and readings on price trends remain mixed.
Labor Market Developments
Many of the labor market indicators were distorted in July and August by the effects
of the General Motors shutdown. But combining the two months to filter out that
noise, growth in overall labor demand appears to have weakened a bit from its robust
pace over the first half of the year. Private nonfarm payrolls expanded an average of
181,000 per month in July and August, down from an average pace of 222,000 per
month in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent
in August, a tad above the low registered in the spring.

the first quarter. Job losses were greatest in the electronic components and apparel
industries, in which the Asian crisis is taking a toll. Outside of manufacturing,
construction employment continued to record healthy gains despite ongoing anecdotal
reports of shortages of skilled workers. Job gains remained strong in the service-
producing sector.1
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonagricultural
payrolls increased 0.1 percent in August after having risen 0.3 percent in July. The
level in August, which was unaffected by the GM strikes, was 0.5 percent above the
second-quarter average. The workweek held steady at 34.6 hours in August for the
third straight month; the workweek has fluctuated around this level since early 1997,
with a modest drop-off in manufacturing being offset by a rise elsewhere in the
economy.
The household survey continues to point to tight labor markets, albeit with a
slight hint of easing pressures. As noted above, the unemployment rate, at
4.5 percent, was a little above the second-quarter average, and total employment has
shown little growth over the past two months. The labor force participation rate
remained at 66.9 percent last month--a touch below the 67.0 percent level that
prevailed in the second quarter, and still farther below the all-time high of this past
winter. The sum of those who would accept a job but have not been searching and
those reporting themselves as unemployed--which represents a measure of the supply
of available workers--has been moving up since May, which is consistent with a
marginal relaxation of labor market pressures.
Other indicators of overall labor market activity remain strong. The four-week
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has remained below its pre-GM
strike level and is consistent with robust employment growth in September.
Manpower Inc.'s survey of hiring strength for the fourth quarter points to considerable
strength in labor demand, although this survey is a better indicator of conditions in the
quarter in which it is administered (in this case the third quarter) than of the
conditions in the survey's reference quarter (the fourth). The adjusted index of help-
1. Employment in retail trade surged in July but posted only a small gain in August, as strong early
summer demand pulled some normal August hiring into July. Conversely, the increase in employment
in the service industry was relatively small in July and considerably stronger in August, reflecting a
large swing in hiring in the help-supply industry--some of which was an indirect effect of the GM
strikes.

wanted advertising remained at a high level in July.2 The demand for new hires still
appears to be straining the available supply: Surveys of hiring conditions by the
National Federation of Independent Businesses and the Bureau of National Affairs
suggest that companies continued to have difficulty hiring new workers in August,
though less so than in July.
Reflecting a dramatic slowdown in output growth last quarter and a more
modest slowing in the hours worked by all persons, labor productivity in the nonfarm
business sector increased 0.1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, down
from the 3.5 percent rise in the first quarter. The productivity figures were held down
by the lost production resulting from the GM strikes because the hours data were
collected before the strikes began. Without the strikes, second-quarter productivity
growth would likely have been roughly 1/2 percentage point greater. Productivity in
the nonfinancial corporate sector rose 2.8 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter, little changed from the 2.6 percent increase recorded in the first quarter. The
substantial difference between productivity in the nonfarm business sector and the
nonfinancial corporate sector reflects some of the same factors that resulted in a
widening of the statistical discrepancy in the second quarter: The output of the
nonfinancial corporate sector, which is estimated from the income side of the national
accounts, has been growing faster than nonfarm business output, which is measured
from the product side.
Turning to the most recent data on labor costs, average hourly earnings of
production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonagricultural payrolls rose at an
average monthly rate of about 1/3 percent in July and August.3 Over the past twelve
months, average hourly earnings rose 4.2 percent, up a couple of tenths from the
increase in the year-earlier period. The three-month change in August dropped below
the corresponding change in May, but given the noise in the monthly figures, it is too
soon to tell whether this reflects a topping out of wage gains.
With respect to benefits costs, information from public-sector employers points
to a step-up in health insurance premium increases in 1999. The Office of Personnel
Management recently announced that total premiums (including both government and
employee shares) for FEHBP health insurance will rise about 10-1/4 percent next year,
2. The Board staff makes rough adjustments to the Conference Board's Index of Help-Wanted
Advertising to account for consolidation in the newspaper industry and the increase in temporary help
employment--which can replace newspaper advertising as a method of posting and filling open positions.
3. As published, average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in July and 0.5 percent in August. BLS
estimates, however, that the effects of the GM strikes held down the July increase by 0.1 percentage
point and boosted the August increase by the same amount.

up from an 8-1/2 percent increase this year--the largest increase in ten years.4 The
California Public Employees' Retirement System, the second largest purchaser of
employee health benefits behind the federal government, announced earlier this year
that overall premiums would increase about 6 percent in 1999 after rising about
3 percent in 1998 and declining in the previous three years. The 1998 increases in
public-sector health insurance costs do not appear to have carried over into the private-
sector premiums that are included in the employment cost index and the hourly
compensation figures. However, the same factors leading to the rise in public-sector
health insurance costs in 1999--mainly rising prescription drug prices and a need to
replenish financial reserves--could contribute to rising private-sector premiums as
well.5
Industrial Production
Industrial output grew 1.7 percent in August, almost entirely because of GM's post-
strike production ramp-up. Outside of the motor vehicles and parts industries,
manufacturing edged up 0.1 percent, remaining nearly unchanged from its level in
May. The rise in production for all of manufacturing in August pushed the factory
operating rate up to 80.4 percent; nevertheless, this rate is more than 1 percentage
point below the long-term average and about 2 percentage points below the level late
last year.
Motor vehicle assemblies shot up to 13.2 million units at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate in August from 8.2 million units in July. Even with the increased pace of
assemblies at GM, inventories of autos and light trucks remained extremely lean in
August. GM's scheduled production through the fourth quarter remains strong, as it
will likely take several months to rebuild dealer stocks.
Outside of motor vehicles and parts, the deterioration in net exports clearly has
contributed to this year's lackluster growth in industrial production. Indeed, most
4. These figures are calculated assuming that enrollment patterns are unchanged from the previous

be 7 percent, rather than 8-1/2 percent.

announcement.II-9

Since the first quarter, producers have largely been able to avoid inventory imbalances,
despite the softening demand, by slowing production accordingly.7
The production of non-auto durable consumer goods slid in August, held down
by a reduction in appliance production, and the output of nondurable consumer goods,
which has been weak all year, pulled back a bit further. The production of business
equipment also fell, as strength in information processing and aircraft production was
outweighed by lower output of industrial and other equipment. Within industrial
equipment, mining and oil and gas machinery continued to recede in response to soft
oil prices, and special industrial machinery--which includes semiconductor
manufacturing equipment--declined further. The output of farm machinery fell in
August as well, because of weakening farm income. One bright spot has been
6. The Beige Book and staff discussions with industry contacts continue to point to reduced exports
to Asia and increased foreign competition for a variety of industries. In addition, National Association
of Purchasing Management surveys indicate that the percentage of manufacturers reporting declines in
export orders minus the percentage reporting increases has been positive and increasing all year.
7. One noteworthy exception is the troubled chemical industry, for which inventory-sales ratios
have risen substantially; domestic output of chemicals has dropped only modestly despite a loss of
market share to a flood of imports. In contrast, producers in the electrical machinery industry have
liquidated inventories since April, as output has not kept pace with thriving demand.II-11

construction equipment, where production has grown sharply this summer, reflecting
the strong pace of construction activity.
Within materials, steel production increased in August after declining for five
straight months. Nonetheless, steel output remains well below its level earlier this
year, and output appears to be weakening substantially in early September. Low-
priced imports are now flooding the market, and domestic producers have been forced
to slash prices and idle some mills. Semiconductor output increased again, but recent
gains lag the pace set last year.8
Leading indicators of industrial production are mixed. In August, the index of
new orders from the National Association of Purchasing Management survey
registered its lowest level in more than two years, with the proportion of companies
reporting increased orders barely exceeding the proportion reporting decreased orders.
In contrast, the staffs estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders has rebounded
recently, advancing more than 4 percent from May to July, and the new orders index
from Dun & Bradstreet remains at a high level.
Consumption and Personal Income
The available data suggest that consumer spending has increased considerably this
quarter, despite a drop-back in vehicle sales from the elevated level of the spring.
We estimate that the level of real personal consumption expenditures in August was
about a percentage point above its second-quarter average, not at an annual rate.
Sales of light vehicles were 14.4 million units (annual rate) in August and
13.8 million units in July, well below the elevated pace of about 16 million units in
the second quarter. The drop in sales reflects the effects of the expiration of the
"coupon" incentive programs offered by the Big Three as well as the recent crippling
strikes at General Motors. Despite a quick ramp-up of production following the
settlement of the strikes in late July, total retail vehicle sales slipped a bit further in
August, as the share of light vehicles going to fleets edged back up toward its recent
average and the sparse stocks at GM dealerships limited retail supply. Sales at Ford
and the major Japanese firms moved up in August, likely benefiting from GM's woes.
Supply constraints at GM are likely to limit sales somewhat for another month or so.
8. Recent news on the semiconductor industry has been mixed. Two Japanese firms recently
announced that they were closing semiconductor plants in the United States, and Motorola has halted
construction of a plant to be built in Richmond. In contrast, Intel and National Semiconductor
announced that orders have picked up lately.II-13

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Looking ahead, the factors affecting near-term sales are more mixed than they
were earlier in the year but still, on balance, appear favorable. Although concerns
about the economic outlook and the loss of stock market wealth may temper future
demand, auto company sources have indicated that September sales got off to a good
start, and car-buying attitudes in the preliminary Michigan SRC survey for the month
were only a little below their average in the first eight months of the year.
Automakers continue to offer attractive pricing: The announced prices of 1999 models
are little changed from the 1998 models, and incentives in the fourth quarter are
expected to at least match those in the third quarter, as GM's concern about market
share has prompted the first significant wave of incentives on 1999 models as well as
revised and extended incentives on 1998 models.
Outside of motor vehicles, household spending on goods has advanced at a
solid clip so far this quarter. Nominal retail sales in the "control" category, which
excludes spending at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose
0.4 percent in August after gaining an upward-revised 0.6 percent in July. Most
components of the control total were up in August, with especially large increases at
apparel outlets and furniture and appliance stores.
Growth in spending on services likely will considerably outpace that for goods
this quarter. Real outlays for services moved up 0.3 percent in July after having risen
at a robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Spending on most types of
non-energy services posted gains in July, led by another large advance in the
recreation category, for which expenditures have been climbing rapidly since the
beginning of the year. At the same time, spending on energy services moved down in
July: Although the weather was unseasonably warm, it was less so than in June.9
Looking beyond July, the very high temperatures in August point to a pickup in
energy services in that month. In addition, the sharp rise in stock market volume at
the end of last month implies at least a modest gain in spending on personal business
services in August, to be followed by a more substantial increase in September.10
Real disposable income appears to be rising swiftly this quarter. The most
recent figures on personal income show a 0.6 percent rise in wages and salaries in
July, and the labor market data for August suggest another large increase in that
9. For consumer spending on energy services, BEA constructs its initial estimates for a given month
by comparing the number of heating and cooling degree days with their seasonal norms. The energy
estimates are typically revised in the third release of a given month to incorporate data from the Energy
Information Administration on actual utility billings.
10. BEA's estimates of the brokerage and investment counseling component of personal business
services are based in part on stock market volume.II-15

month. Outside of labor income, July changes in most components of personal
income were in line with those of recent months. With personal income up more than
outlays in July, the personal saving rate jumped 0.7 percentage point from June,
although at 0.8 percent, it remained extraordinarily low.
During the past few years, the saving rate has dropped roughly 3 percentage
points. Over this period, household wealth has soared relative to disposable income.
The drop in the stock market since July undoubtedly will cause a noticeable decline in
the wealth-income ratio this quarter, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests
that--even if the market had stabilized at its record high--the so-called "wealth effect"
alone would have caused consumption growth to have fallen roughly 1/4 percentage
point in the second half of this year as the lagged effect of past stock price increases
dissipated." The recent drop in equity prices will likely result in a more pronounced
slowing in consumption growth. Assuming that the stock market stays at its current
level (roughly 9500 on the Wilshire 5000), the recent decline in equity values should
trim an additional 1/2 percentage point or so off of consumption growth in the second
half of 1998, bringing the total decline in the contribution of the wealth effect to
consumption growth to a little less than a percentage point.
Households' reactions to recent financial market developments appear to be
reflected in Michigan SRC data on consumer sentiment. The overall Michigan index
fell noticeably in early September after slipping in August, although the current
reading is still at the top of the range that prevailed before the beginning of last year.
The decline in the overall index was attributable to markedly less favorable views by
households of their current and expected personal financial situations as well as
substantially less optimistic expectations of business conditions over the next year. In
addition, the index of the expected change in unemployment over the next twelve
months moved up sharply. When asked about unfavorable economic news they had
heard, survey respondents cited both stock price declines and the widening trade
deficit.
11. The calculation assumes that an additional dollar of stock market wealth leads to a permanent
rise in the level of consumption of three cents, with about 60 percent of the adjustment occurring in the
first year. Most econometric models produce a marginal propensity to consume out of wealth of
between zero and six cents, with the adjustment occurring over several years. The bulk of the estimates
fall in the middle of this range, though most are not very precise.II-19

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Housing Markets
Demand for single-family homes has been robust so far this year, and the most recent
data indicate that activity has stayed at a high level. Starts of single-family homes
were at a 1.25 million unit annual rate in August, similar to the average posted during
the first seven months of the year. In July, sales of new single-family homes were at
an 886,000 unit pace, slightly higher than in the first half. Sales of existing homes--
which are a lagging indicator of housing demand because they are recorded mainly at
closings--came in at a 4.93 million unit rate in July, more than 4 percent above the
first-half pace.
Indicators of near-term housing demand continue to be quite favorable: The
thirty-year, fixed mortgage rate, which has been under 7 percent since last spring, has
edged down further in recent weeks. Builders' assessments of current sales conditions,
which reached a record high in July, have eased only slightly during the past two
months. Mortgage applications for home purchase have been strong all year, and the
MBA index of loan applications set another new high in mid-September. Consumers'
assessments of home-buying conditions, which posted an all-time high in April, have
receded in recent months but remain at a very favorable level by historical standards.
Affordability for existing homes, as measured by an index calculated by the
National Association of Realtors, increased sharply in the latter part of 1997 and
during the first two months of this year, owing mainly to a decline in the thirty-year,
fixed mortgage rate. Although it remains at an historically high level, this
affordability index has slipped during the past six months. Rates drifted a bit lower
during that period, but price increases for existing homes outpaced gains in median
household income. By contrast, new home affordability, a measure constructed by the
staff, has continued to improve in recent months, primarily reflecting the more
moderate rate of increase in the median price of new homes.12
Multifamily starts, which are highly volatile on a monthly basis, jumped to
407,000 units at an annual rate in July but fell back to 368,000 units in August. The
July-August average for these starts was almost 17 percent above the first-half
average. Multifamily permits rose 8-1/2 percent last month, and the permit backlog
edged up. Other indicators of market conditions in the multifamily sector are mixed.
The vacancy rate for these units, a highly volatile measure, rose to 9.4 percent in the
second quarter, about 1/4 percentage point above its year-earlier reading and the
highest rate since mid-1996. Still, real rents for apartments have been rising at about
12. This index is based on the same formula as the NAR index for the affordability of existing
homes.II-21

Business Fixed Investment
After a blistering first half, growth in real business fixed investment appears set for a
pause in the current quarter. The slowing in large measure reflects the effects of the
GM strikes: Supply shortages created by the strikes led to a substantial reduction in
fleet sales over the summer and curtailed consumer leasing, which is counted as
spending on producers' durable equipment in the national accounts. Outside of light
motor vehicles, however, business spending on equipment likely has continued to rise.
In the high-tech sector, computer prices have continued to fall rapidly:
Although the inventory adjustment that drove price-cutting over the first half of the
year appears to be over, technological change and falling prices of components have
fueled further large price declines. The PPI for computing equipment, which is
hedonically adjusted to account for product improvements, fell 4-1/2 percent in August
alone, driven by a record 13 percent drop in the price of personal computers. Despite
these ongoing price declines, nominal shipments of computing equipment have held up
well; they were unchanged in July following a 7-1/2 percent increase in June. Thus,
real expenditures on office and computing equipment appear poised for another huge
gain in the current quarter.
Orders and shipments of communications equipment, which have been
increasingly erratic in the past two years, plummeted in July. However, a number of
factors suggest that shipments for this category may bounce back at least somewhat in
the coming months. These factors include a sizable backlog of unfilled orders, further
expansion of the Internet, and fiber optic upgrades for cable systems.
Sales of medium and heavy trucks rose sharply further in August, reaching an
annual rate of 546,000 units. So far this quarter, sales are running substantially above
the second-quarter pace. Even so, backlogs moved higher last month, suggesting that
the near-term outlook is still favorable.
Excluding transportation and high-tech equipment, orders and shipments have
picked up in recent months. After having fallen earlier in the year, orders posted
strong gains in June and July. Moreover, the July level of shipments in this category,
though off somewhat from June's, still stood 1.2 percent above the second-quarter
average.

Domestic demand for capital equipment has been considerably stronger this
year than might be suggested by a literal reading of the data on orders and shipments
alone. Trade flows loom large in the capital goods sector, and weak demand from
abroad has appreciably held down shipments by U.S. producers in recent quarters.
Between October 1997 and July 1998, exports of computing equipment declined
14 percent, exports of communications equipment declined 15 percent, and exports of
capital goods excluding high-tech and transportation equipment fell 7 percent. Over
the same period, computer shipments rose 18 percent, shipments excluding high-tech
and transportation equipment rose 3-1/2 percent, and shipments of communications
equipment fell only 3 percent, despite the sharp decline in July.14 That total shipments
have continued to grow despite the substantial negative external shock from abroad is
an indication of robust domestic demand.
Nonresidential construction activity has remained sluggish overall. Ample
capacity in the factory sector has put construction of industrial buildings on a
downward trend since early 1997. Construction of retail and lodging buildings has
been flat so far this year. The one bright spot has been the office sector, in which
outlays have been on a strong uptrend for the past two years or so. Contracts for
construction, an important leading indicator, have weakened significantly this year,
even for the office sector. Furthermore, available financing for commercial real estate,
such as real estate investment trusts and commercial mortgage-backed securities, has
tightened considerably recently. These indicators suggest that a pickup from the
sluggish growth in nonresidential building activity remains unlikely in the near future.
Business Inventories
After declining sharply in the second quarter, investment in business inventories fell
off further in July. For manufacturing and trade excluding motor vehicles, the book
value of inventories rose at a $23 billion annual rate in July, continuing the downshift
in the pace of stockbuilding from the first-quarter bulge. The latest figure translates
into a 2-1/2 percent annual rate of growth in the book value of non-auto stocks.
Inventory-sales ratios remain moderate on the whole.
14. Over the October-to-July period, the ratio of exports to shipments fell from 45 percent to 33
percent for computers, from 37 percent to 29 percent for communications equipment, and from 49
percent to 44 percent for equipment excluding high-tech and transportation. Some caveats are required
in interpreting these ratios. For computers, parts account for a high proportion of exports. Such
shipments are not counted as final demand and thus do not affect expenditures on producers' durable
equipment in the national accounts. Also, the definition of the "other equipment" category in the orders
and shipments (M-3) release differs slightly from the definition in the merchandise trade report.II-29

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
In manufacturing, inventories increased at a $16 billion annual rate in July, just
off the second-quarter pace. As in the spring, an above-average share of the July
buildup was in stocks of aircraft and parts. Rising inventories of aircraft parts and
partially completed airplanes are a natural consequence of the increased production
rates at Boeing. However, finished aircraft are also being stockpiled, as Boeing has
not yet acquired the legal rights to divert some planes earmarked for struggling Asian
airlines to other carriers. Outside of aircraft, manufacturers' inventories grew at a
$10 billion pace in July.
The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles was little
changed in July after an appreciable buildup in the first half of the year. A slight
increase in inventories at distributors of nondurable goods, mainly chemicals and farm
products, was offset by a small net drawdown in stocks held by durable goods
wholesalers. The latter was led by a further decline in inventories at professional and
commercial equipment wholesalers, a category that includes computer distributors.
Although much of this decline likely stems from efforts of computer makers to move
toward direct delivery of PCs--as indicated by the lowest inventory-sales ratio on
record in this category--some of the decrease might also reflect the recent steep drop
in PC prices.
In retail trade, book-value inventories dropped again in July, reflecting the
sharp decline in stocks at automotive dealerships. Excluding autos, retail inventories
rose at a moderate rate, a touch above the pace of accumulation in the second quarter.
The buildup was led by a sizable increase in stocks held by furniture and appliance
stores. Most other categories registered small positive changes in inventories.
Federal Government
With one month left in the fiscal year, the federal government clearly will post its first
unified budget surplus since 1969 and its largest surplus as a share of GDP since
1957. This favorable outcome is the result of a meager increase in outlays and a huge
rise in receipts.
Total outlays fell in July and August relative to a year earlier owing in part to
the timing of payments for several programs. After adjusting for the timing shifts and
excluding deposit insurance outlays and spectrum auction proceeds, spending was
0.2 percent higher than a year earlier. Medicare has been an important contributor to
the slowing of outlays: Spending for the program over the twelve months ending in
August was only 1.6 percent above the previous twelve months--one of the smallest
increases in its history, in part reflecting the cost-containment actions taken in lastII-31

year's Balanced Budget Act. Other prominent areas of spending restraint were
defense, net interest (reflecting lower interest rates and the reduction in publicly held
debt), and income security payments (reflecting the reductions in caseloads for means-
tested public assistance programs).
Receipts in July and August were 9 percent higher than a year earlier as
receipts of individual income taxes continued to rise more rapidly than the NIPA-
based estimates of the underlying tax base (which excludes capital gains). Receipts
were held down in August by weak excise tax collections attributable to a delay in
payments allowed under last year's Balanced Budget Act.15
Congress has yet to complete action on the fiscal 1999 budget. The budget
resolution has not been completed owing to disagreements over the extent to which
last year's budget agreement should be modified to accommodate tax cuts and
spending increases. The House is considering a tax bill that would reduce receipts by
$6 billion in fiscal 1999 and by roughly $18 billion per year over the succeeding four
years. Proposals to boost spending on agriculture, Y2K-related problems, embassy
security, and defense are also under consideration, but no decision has been made
whether to treat them as emergency measures, and thus raise overall spending, or to
require offsets in other programs. As of September 22, only one of the thirteen
regular appropriations bills had been sent to the President, and a short-term continuing
resolution had been passed to fund the government when the new fiscal year begins
October 1.
State and Local Governments
Indicators of real spending by state and local governments so far in the third quarter
have been mixed, with employment up and construction down. State and local
employment rose substantially in August, adding to a modest increase in July. The
bulk of the hiring in August was at local governments, particularly at school districts,
for which the increase appears to reflect earlier starting dates for many schools;
according to BLS, this trend has been apparent for about five years.16 Real
construction expenditures by state and local governments fell 1-1/2 percent at a
15. Excise taxes totaled only $3 billion in August, about half the level recorded in July. The
Balanced Budget Act included provisions allowing a delay in payment of certain excise taxes due in
August and September until October.

basis and, hence, are on the payrolls in the summer.II-33

monthly rate in July, to a level just a bit below the second-quarter average. Much of
the weakness in July was in educational buildings and highways.
Gubernatorial elections will take place in nearly three-quarters of the states this
fall, and many candidates likely will include tax cuts among their campaign promises.
The popularity of tax rate reductions reflects continued strong revenues. Most
recently, the Center for the Study of the States reported that revenues increased
9.7 percent over the twelve months ending in the second quarter. The strength was
especially apparent in income tax collections, which increased 19.5 percent. Although
a number of states were expecting strong gains in personal income tax receipts, the
magnitude of the rise came as a surprise to many governments. By comparison, over
the 1992 to 1997 period the average annual rise was 6.7 percent. For the twelve
months ending in the second quarter of 1998, sales tax receipts rose 5.3 percent, a
little below the annual average over the preceding six years, and corporate tax revenue
declined a little.
Prices
Both the overall consumer price index and the index excluding food and energy
increased 0.2 percent in July and August. The twelve-month change in the core CPI
was 2.5 percent in August, up 0.2 percentage point from the rate recorded over the
year-earlier period; the overall index was up only 1.6 percent over the past twelve
months because of the sharp decline in energy prices. The PCE deflator excluding
food and energy also rose 0.2 percent in July, the latest month for which data are
available, but increased just 1.1 percent over the twelve months ending in July.17
Consumer food prices rose 0.2 percent in both July and August. The index for
fruits and vegetables moved down last month after having risen in July, while price
increases for other foods picked up somewhat. Over the twelve months ending in
August, overall food prices rose 2.2 percent, down slightly from a 2.5 percent pace in
the year-earlier period. The CPI for energy fell 1.0 percent in August after no change
in July and is down about 7.7 percent over the past twelve months. Retail gasoline
prices dropped 1.5 percent in August, and survey evidence for early September
suggests that they have slid further; however, crude oil prices have turned up in recent
weeks, suggesting that declines in retail prices of gasoline may be behind us.
The consumer price index for commodities other than food and energy
increased 0.2 percent in August, a little faster than its pace in recent months. The

basis, shows a similar 1.1 percent increase over the four quarters ending in the second quarter.II-35

twelve-month change in core commodity prices was 1.1 percent, up from a 0.6 percent
pace a year ago. Apparel prices jumped 1.1 percent in August, as the late occurrence
of Labor Day caused holiday and "back-to-school" discounts to be concentrated in
September this year instead of being offered in August as well.18 Also, prices of new
motor vehicles increased 0.3 percent in August, following a 0.5 percent hike in July,
as the Big Three coupon incentives were withdrawn." Looking forward, major
automakers have announced flat or lower prices for comparably equipped vehicles in
the new model year, and General Motors has announced a sweetening of incentives to
bolster post-strike sales. Retail prices of tobacco products were up only 0.1 percent in
August--despite another hike in the wholesale price of cigarettes that month--following
a 2.6 percent increase in July. Over the past twelve months, the CPI for tobacco has
risen 12.4 percent.
Prices of non-energy services rose 0.3 percent in August after increasing
0.2 percent in each of the preceding two months; the index has risen 3.1 percent over
the past year, about the same as last year. Owners' equivalent rent increased
0.2 percent in August, a bit less than the average monthly increase over the past year,
while rates for lodging away from home jumped 0.7 percent in August, reversing
July's drop. Among services excluding energy and shelter, prices for medical care
increased 0.3 percent in August--in line with the average pace over the past year. In
contrast, telephone service charges dropped 1.1 percent in August and are up only 1/2
percent so far this year.
Most other broad measures of inflation have continued to rise less rapidly than
has the CPI, and these prices have also decelerated to a greater degree over the past
year. The four-quarter change in the GDP chain price index was just 1 percent in the
second quarter, half the rate recorded in 1997:Q2. About one-quarter of the
deceleration in GDP prices over the past four quarters can be attributed to a large
decline in the rate of change in the implicit price index for services provided to
consumers without charge by financial institutions, a component of PCE;20 elsewhere
in PCE, a modest slowing in inflation rates was widespread across expenditure groups.
18. BLS attempts to account for the timing of Labor Day in its seasonal adjustment procedures but
does not feel that it adequately captures the effect. As a result, some of the August increase may be
reversed in the September data.
19. Because of bimonthly sampling for some cities in the CPI, the effect of withdrawing coupons
was spread over July and August.
20. After rising 13 percent over the four quarters ending in 1997:Q2, inputed prices for services
provided without charge by financial institutions increased only 2.3 percent in the year ending in
1998:Q2--somewhat below the long-term average increase in these prices.II-37

Large declines in energy and non-oil import prices have helped hold down GDP prices
by reducing materials costs and by providing more intense competition for
domestically produced goods, while a deceleration in food prices has contributed
directly to slower growth in GDP prices. In addition, a decline in the rate of increase
of government prices--in part due to slower growth in average hourly compensation
for government workers--to the slowest pace in thirty-eight years contributed
1/4 percentage point to the deceleration in GDP prices over the past year.
Short-term inflation expectations have turned back down recently after having
backed up somewhat in the second quarter. According to the Michigan survey,
median one-year inflation expectations were 2.4 percent in the third quarter, the same
rate as the low recorded in the first quarter of the year and 0.3 percentage point below
expectations a year ago. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have stabilized
in the third quarter at very low rates, with both the Michigan median five-to-ten-year
inflation expectations and the Philadelphia Fed's survey of professional forecasters
ten-year expectations between 1/4 and 1/2 percentage point below the pace recorded a
year earlier.
Prices of capital goods continued to weaken in recent months. The PPI for
capital equipment fell 0.3 percent in August, after edging up in July, and is down
0.7 percent over the past twelve months. Computer prices fell 4.5 percent in August,
led by a whopping decline in personal computer prices. Over the twelve months to
August, overall computer prices have dropped 26 percent, compared with 23 percent
over the preceding twelve months.
Inflation remains dormant at earlier stages of processing. The PPI for
intermediate materials other than food and energy edged down again in August to a
level 0.5 percent below a year earlier. The PPI for core crude materials dropped
considerably further in both July and August and is down nearly 11 percent over the
past year.21 Within crude materials, price declines have been widespread over the past
year, with the drop in metals prices particularly large. Since the mid-August PPI
reporting date, many industrial commodity prices have declined further. The Journal
of Commerce industrial price index is down about 1-1/4 percent since that time, while
the Commodity Research Bureau measure of industrial commodity prices has declined
about 4-1/2 percent. Both the JOC and CRB measures include industrial materials,
such as metals and fibers, but the JOC measure includes energy commodities and
21. Raw materials other than petroleum make up a small proportion of the cost structure of finished
core consumer goods. Therefore, even for declines in raw materials prices of this magnitude, the direct
effect on retail consumer prices is fairly small.II-39

forest products not included in the CRB measure. Over the past year, the CRB futures
index, which attracts a good deal of market attention, has dropped 16 percent;
however, only a small share of this index reflects changes in industrial commodities
prices, and its coverage of industrial commodities is narrow--only copper and cotton
are included.22
Developments in Agriculture
Agricultural prices remain weak. The PPI for crude foodstuffs fell 7-3/4 percent over
the twelve months ending in August, with over half of the decline occurring in July
and August. The fall in prices came against a backdrop of favorable reports on the
prospective harvests of most food crops, increased levels of livestock production,
sluggishness of real agricultural exports, and sizable increases in farm inventories.
In the aggregate, crop output this year probably is going to come close to
matching the high level of 1997, despite a moderate cutback in aggregate plantings,
several weeks of severe heat and drought across the southern tier of states this past
summer, and scattered problems with weather and plant disease in the main
agricultural areas of the Midwest. To be sure, the adverse weather in the South did
cut sharply into the national output of some crops that are more heavily concentrated
in that region-the USDA is projecting production declines for cotton and tobacco of
28 percent and 14 percent respectively. However, these losses appear to have been
offset in the aggregate by increased production of the major food commodities-wheat,
corn, and soybeans. National average yields of all three crops are expected to be
above their estimated long-run trends this year, and, according to the Agriculture
Department's latest crop forecasts, combined output of the three crops will be up
4 percent from that of last year.
Livestock output also has moved up appreciably this year, probably by almost
2 percent overall. Output of pork is registering an especially large increase--close to
9 percent in terms of annual totals--and marketings of other livestock products are
projected to record percentage gains that are small to moderate. A 1 percent gain in
output now anticipated for beef is notable mainly because it contrasts so sharply with
earlier expectations that cutbacks in the size of the cattle herd would be constraining
the flow of product to consumers this year; the USDA has pushed back to 1999 its
forecast of a big decline in the output of beef. By contrast, production gains have
22. More than half of the CRB futures index is made up of food commodities, with the remaining
weight divided among energy commodities, precious metals, and industrial commodities.II-43

been smaller than usual for milk and poultry--two farm products that have been among
the few to experience rising prices this year.
Farm exports surged for a time during the first half of the 1990s; but gains
have been slow since about 1995, and, according to preliminary NIPA data for the
second quarter, farm export volume has not grown at all this past year. Exports of
some key products--notably the grains--have dropped sharply since the mid-1990s. By
contrast, shipments of meats and poultry have continued to move up, although the
gains this year will apparently be smaller that those of recent years. The sluggishness
of farm exports overall is primarily a reflection of the economic problems in Asia, the
region that U.S. producers had been counting on most heavily for market expansion.
Farm inventories changed little, on net, from the end of 1989 to the end of
1995, as temporary spells of accumulation during that period tended to be followed in
fairly quick succession by spells of decumulation. The past three years, however, have
brought a more sustained period of stockbuilding. According to the NIPA data, nearly
3 percent of all farm output in 1996 and 1997 went into inventories, and a large share
of this year's output also seems to be headed for the storage bin. The USDA's
September update of its crop forecasts indicates that the combined stocks of wheat,
corn, and soybeans at the end of the current marketing year will be the largest since
the late 1980s, when big inventory overhangs that had accumulated earlier in that
decade finally were worked off.
Clearly, this inventory build is not sustainable. However, the manner in which
the buildup will eventually be halted and current excesses worked down is not so
obvious. The best alternative, of course, would be the renewal of a healthy uptrend in
real farm exports. Absent that, domestic producers will need to adjust output to a
level that is more in line with scaled-down prospects for demand. In the past, such
adjustments typically were coordinated by the federal government, which provided
inducements to farmers to take acreage out of production when stocks seemed to be
growing excessively large. But those policy options were eliminated by the Freedom
to Farm Act, and the history of recent decades offers little guidance for judging how
quickly farmers might act to adjust production in the absence of government supply
controls. If next year's early reports on planting intentions do not show significant
acreage adjustments--and if exports are still looking sluggish--pressures on the federal
government to re-establish some form of supply control in agriculture almost surely
will intensify.
Even apart from the possibility of renewed supply management and the costs it
might entail, federal spending on agriculture will likely be increasing over the nearII-45

term. For example, farmers still have the option of taking out loans from the
Commodity Credit Corporation to aid in the financing of inventories, and these loans
will likely be used more heavily than in other recent years. So-called loan deficiency
payments, which are linked to the CCC loan programs, also are kicking in at present
because market prices have dropped below the specified levels that trigger those
payments. In the 1999 fiscal year, farmers also will have the option of receiving their
"production flexibility payments" at an earlier date than previously had been
scheduled; these payments, amounting to several billion dollars per year, are made
annually over the seven-year period covered by the Freedom to Farm legislation.
Other policy actions to aid farmers seem to have substantial support in Congress and
from the Administration, and a number of proposals are currently under discussion.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
An intensification of concerns about the global economy has triggered substantial
declines in the values of risk assets in recent weeks. In volatile trading, major equity
indexes have fallen between 5 percent and 9 percent since the August FOMC meeting,
with financial sector stocks taking especially large hits. Yield spreads on a broad
range of debt securities have widened appreciably relative to Treasuries, owing to the
heightened preference for safety and liquidity. Even among Treasury securities,
investors have shown a marked preference for liquidity, bidding the prices of "on-the-
run" securities up notably relative to "off-the-run" issues. The search for a safe haven
--and the widespread view that deteriorating prospects for world growth will prompt
the Federal Reserve to ease over coming months--has pushed down Treasury yields as
much as 2/3 percentage point over the intermeeting period. Indeed, the entire
Treasury yield curve has moved far below the 5.5 percent federal funds rate, with the
thirty-year bond rate at one point in recent days touching a low of 5.04 percent.
Although bond yields have risen absolutely only for lower-rated corporate
credits, the recent market turbulence has disrupted long-term debt issuance along a
broad front during the past several weeks. The volume of investment-grade offerings
has fallen markedly since the second week of August, and high-yield issuance has
virtually ceased. New issuance has dried up in the equity markets as well. Not
surprisingly, many firms with urgent financing needs have turned to the commercial
paper and bank loan markets. The monetary aggregates have reflected the
corresponding expansion of bank credit and the tendency of retail investors to seek
refuge in money market funds.
Amid the turmoil, bank loan officers have become more cautious in recent
weeks, reportedly tightening underwriting standards and terms on commercial and
industrial loans; spreads on syndicated loans, especially for lower-rated borrowers,
evidently have widened appreciably. Moreover, financing for commercial real restate
transactions from all major sources has been curtailed.
Household sector borrowing has continued to be sizable, largely fueled by
increases in mortgage debt; with the drop in mortgage rates to a new cyclical low,
another surge in applications for refinancing is now under way. Despite generally
positive indicators of household credit quality, increased investor caution has
reportedly caused a substantial falloff in sales of securitized subprime loans, likely
prompting more sober lending postures among originators.

Domestic Financial Developments
With the federal government headed for a sizable surplus in FY1998, the
Treasury will make a third-quarter paydown of debt for the first time in twenty-five
years. The credit quality of states and localities remains strong, and these units have
continued to borrow considerable amounts to finance capital outlays and to refund
higher-cost debt.
Business Finance
Bond issuance by nonfinancial businesses nearly halted in late August, and conditions
have remained difficult in September. Yield spreads of existing issues over Treasuries
have widened sharply, especially for "junk" bonds. Despite sizable declines in
Treasury yields, the level of investment-grade yields has fallen only a little since the
August FOMC, and a broad index of yields on speculative-grade issues actually has
risen about 100 basis points. The jump in junk-bond yields reflects some greater
concerns about credit quality, but also the reluctance of investors to hold these
securities--which offer very limited liquidity--at a time of heightened uncertainty.
Given the inhospitable conditions in the capital markets, higher-quality firms
have tapped the commercial paper market, boosting issuance in that market
considerably in August and the first half of September. In the speculative-grade
sector, where only one borrower has sold debt in volume since mid-August,
commercial paper issuance is not a ready alternative. Instead, lower-quality borrowers
tend to substitute for market financing by turning to bank loans, but those businesses
that have attempted to do so in recent weeks likely found tighter credit standards and
terms--as suggested by early information from the special Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey.' The banks that reported having tightened attributed their actions to a less
favorable economic outlook, a worsening in industry-specific problems, and a reduced
tolerance for risk. Further evidence of a shift in banks' lending attitudes can be found
in the syndicated loan market, where lenders have reportedly been pulling back from
new credits and spreads on lower-quality loans have widened a good bit.
Although concerns about the economic outlook are prompting a reassessment
of default risks in some sectors, Moody's downgraded, on net, only a small amount of
nonfinancial debt in August and the first half of September. Moreover, its
Watchlist--a more timely indicator of credit quality--still points to a small net upgrade
of nonfinancial debt in the near term, though some financial institutions have been put
on watch for downgrading. With business activity strong to date, the actual default
1. The full results from the September loan officer survey will be included in the Greenbook
supplement to be published at the end of the week.

rate on corporate debt is well below its average level over the past decade, and the
business failure rate remains at its lowest level in ten years.
Gross equity issuance also came to a near halt in recent weeks, leaving its
volume for August and so far in September well below the pace earlier this year. At
the same time, both equity retirements and announcements of share buyback programs
have remained strong. Despite the extreme volatility in equity markets, several
pending merger deals have been completed since the August FOMC meeting.
Nonetheless, if the prospects for future corporate earnings continue to deteriorate, the
long list of still-pending deals may shorten as firms reevaluate their strategic
alternatives or as financing for cash-payment deals becomes less readily available.
Equity prices declined further over the intermeeting period amid outsized daily
swings. During the first week of September, both volume and the implied one-month
volatility derived from S&P 500 option prices jumped to extremely high levels. Since
then, the market has partially reversed the late-August losses, but implied volatility has
remained elevated, suggesting that investors continue to be highly uncertain about
events going forward. The DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ indexes have declined
between 5 and 8 percent since the last FOMC meeting and are 13 to 16 percent below
the record highs posted in July. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization
firms has fallen a bit more than large-cap stocks since mid-August, continuing to
underperform broader indexes. Financial sector stocks have been hit especially hard
over the intermeeting period--some losing close to half their value since the July
highs--as several banks and securities firms have announced substantial losses owing
to exposure, direct or indirect, to Russian and other emerging markets, and as investors
have worried about additional losses.
Company analysts have been marking down their estimates of third-quarter
operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms--and by more than is customary as the
quarter-end approaches. On the basis of data through the third week of September,
earnings growth over the year ended in the third quarter is projected to be slightly
negative, well below the 7 percent growth projected for that period as recently as
mid-July. Revisions have been concentrated in the energy and financial sectors.
Extending a pattern observed since the beginning of the year, analysts have only
slightly revised their earnings growth forecasts beyond the current quarter; the latest
surveys indicate that a major resurgence of earnings is expected in 1999.
The supply of finance for commercial real estate has tightened dramatically in
recent months. Share prices of real estate investment trusts, which dropped 6 percent
over the second quarter, have shed an additional 10-1/2 percent since then; the office

and hotel sectors have been particularly hard hit. Although vacancy rates remain low
and rental income growth strong, investors fear that construction already in the
pipeline will weigh on earnings in the future.
In this environment, REITs have about stopped issuing shares. Press reports
suggest that bank financing for REITs also has been less readily available in the past
few months. Reflecting the more limited availability of funding, REIT acquisitions of
properties slowed markedly in August, with the value of purchases less than half the
average rate from January through July.
The issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities also has slowed
sharply from the robust first-half pace. Yields rose markedly in August for both the
investment-grade and speculative-grade tranches of these securities. Thus far in
September, investment-grade yields have reversed last month's rise, but yields on
lower-rated tranches have continued to rise. Across the entire quality range, spreads
on CMBS relative to Treasury securities are at their highest levels since 1995.
Moreover, despite the decline in investment-grade yields, many Wall Street conduits
have been left holding large pools of mortgages originated in the spring and early
summer that cannot be profitably securitized at current CMBS yields.2 As a result,
there are reports of conduits backing out of deals that correspondents had arranged but
not closed, and in the last week of August many correspondents stopped quoting rates
to borrowers altogether. Initial reports for September suggest that these lenders have
still not reentered the market.
Household Sector Finance
Household balance sheets have deteriorated considerably during the third quarter. The
ratio of household net worth to income fell noticeably, primarily because of the
decline in equity prices. Since the end of the second quarter, the decline is estimated
to have trimmed about $700 billion from the value of households' directly held
equities and $500 billion from the value of assets held indirectly, primarily in mutual
funds and pension funds.
2. Conduits are firms that facilitate the origination and securitization of mortgages; they usually rely
on one or more correspondents, often banks, to originate the loans, and they provide the underwriting
standards for the loans and issue the securities. Conduits such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley,
and Capital America (formerly Nomura Securities) are among the largest issuers of CMBS.
Loans originated for securitization are usually securitized two to six months after they are
originated. The securitizer, typically a Wall Street conduit, warehouses the loans after origination and
bears the interest rate risk.

Domestic Financial Developments
Although the drop in equity prices caused most of the "rebalancing" of
portfolios, households recently took some measured actions to shift their financial
holdings into other types of assets. Shareholders pulled more than $11 billion from
equity mutual funds in August and almost $1 billion from hybrid funds.3 Preliminary
data provided by the ICI on a confidential basis indicate that equity fund flows turned
positive in the first half of September, but the rate of inflow was only about half of
that posted earlier this year. In contrast, bond funds and, especially, money market
funds have received strong inflows recently. Among bond funds, households
reallocated assets from global and high-yield bond funds into less-risky government
and investment-grade corporate bond funds.
Based on data through mid-September, household debt is estimated to have
grown moderately in the third quarter, with its mortgage component increasing at an
almost 9 percent annual rate and consumer credit expanding at only a 3 percent pace.
Mortgage debt has been fueled by low and declining mortgage rates and brisk home
sales. Applications for mortgage refinancing have surged in recent weeks, and
confidential data from Freddie Mac show that 37 percent of its mortgage refinancings
in July (the latest month available) involved some cashing out of equity. The growth
of consumer credit has likely been restrained somewhat by paydowns financed by
home equity loans and cash-out mortgage refinancings.
In general, recently released data on household credit quality remain good.
Call Report data indicate that the delinquency rate on overall consumer loans in the
second quarter remained close to where it has been for more than a year. Similarly,
the Call Report delinquency rate on credit card accounts was about unchanged in the
second quarter, while the rate calculated by the ABA rose slightly. In contrast,
Moody's reported that the delinquency rate on credit card accounts in securitized pools
fell in July--its eighth straight monthly decline. According to the MBA, the home
mortgage delinquency rate edged down in the second quarter, and auto finance
companies reported that delinquencies dropped in July, to a level well below the
second-quarter average.
Despite favorable readings on household credit quality, investors appear to be
more reluctant to add asset-backed securities to their portfolios, presumably reflecting
3. These outflows represented less than one-half percent of the assets of equity and hybrid funds. On
average, these mutual funds had more-than-adequate liquidity to cover these redemptions, as shown in
the table. Households also shifted a small portion of their assets held in self-directed pension plans.
Data from an industry report on 401(k) pension plans indicate that accountholders transferred some of
their assets from equities to fixed-income instruments in August, but these transfers represented only
about 1 percent of assets in the surveyed plans.

less tolerance for risk and a desire for greater liquidity. Spreads have widened, and
industry contacts indicate that lower-quality issues and tranches have become more
difficult to place with investors. The demand for assets backed by high loan-to-value
home equity loans has fallen off especially sharply, and new deals have been sparse in
the past few weeks. Some subprime lenders have responded to the scarcity of
investors by securing buyer commitments before making loans, while others have
scaled back their issuance.
Federal Government Finance
The budget position of the U.S. Treasury continued to improve during the intermeeting
period. However, even as it has paid down debt, the Treasury stepped up weekly bill
auction sizes by $3 billion recently, from the low $13 billion level that had prevailed
since April. This increase, while larger than we expected, follows up on the
Treasury's stated intent to expand the supply of short-dated debt; the weekly auctions
will be split evenly, with $8 billion each of thirteen- and twenty-six-week bills. The
Treasury also plans to raise about $8 billion in October through a ten-year indexed
note auction and is expected to announce in the next few months a regular schedule of
quarterly indexed offerings for 1999 and beyond.
The Treasury's new indexed savings bonds, I-bonds, became available this
month in several denominations from $50 to $5,000. The bonds have no fixed
maturity, but cease earning interest after thirty years and incur a penalty if cashed
before five years. The bonds pay a fixed rate set by the Treasury every six months,
plus an inflation premium based on changes in the CPI-U over a six-month period.
The current fixed rate, valid for the life of the bond, is 3.40 percent, and the current
inflation compensation brings the nominal return on the bond to an annualized
4.66 percent.
Mounting pressures on international financial markets have accelerated the
decline in foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. Those balances at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York have fallen more than $20 billion since the end of
August--and $50 billion since June, a decline of nearly 10 percent--apparently in
connection with attempts by several central banks to defend their domestic currencies.
Gross debt issuance by government-sponsored enterprises has edged down over
the intermeeting period, but it remains at a strong level. Fannie Mae and the Federal
Home Loan Bank have brought large issues of new debt to the market, reflecting the
ongoing strength of mortgage loan originations and increases in the asset holdings of
these agencies.

Domestic Financial Developments
Although agency debt yields have declined over the intermeeting period,
spreads between noncallable agency-issued securities and Treasuries have widened
14 to 29 basis points--almost doubling their norms and indicating the substantial
premium that investors are paying for the higher liquidity of the Treasury market.
Yield spreads have also widened on even the most liquid issues of agency debt,
including the Benchmark and Reference Note series that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
issued over the past year.
Municipal Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds in August and the first three weeks of
September was below the torrid second-quarter pace but remained at a high level.
Boosted by declining rates, refunding as a percentage of gross long-term issuance rose
to 42 percent in August, and incoming data suggest even higher readings for
September. Issuance to raise new capital also remained healthy in August and, to
date, in September.
On the demand side, uncertainty in the corporate securities market has likely
sparked some renewed investor interest in the municipal bond market, as evidenced by
larger inflows into municipal bond funds. Nonetheless, because of their relative lack
of liquidity, municipal bonds have not benefited as much as Treasuries from safe-
haven buying, and the ratio of yields on revenue bonds to Treasury yields has risen to
a twelve-year high.
Credit quality in the state and local sector continued to improve over the inter-
meeting period, with the number of upgrades outpacing downgrades by three to one.
Money and Bank Credit
Both bank credit and the monetary aggregates have been importantly influenced by the
turbulence in financial markets. Bank credit expanded at a brisk 16-1/4 percent annual
rate in August, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting effects, with both loans
and securities posting sizable gains. Business loans grew at a 12 percent pace in
August, even after being held down by a large securitization early in the month. As
noted above, the strength in business loans likely reflects, in part, some substitution
away from market financing. Incoming data suggest another strong month for
business loans in September.
Consumer loans originated by banks expanded at only a 3-1/2 percent pace in
August, as households appear to have continued to substitute mortgage and home
equity debt for consumer loans. Growth of real estate loans picked up in August to a

6 percent rate, but in light of low mortgage rates and a robust housing market, the
amount of credit that banks originated during the month was likely stronger than the
reported number, which was held down by securitizations. Early indications for
September suggest that real estate loans are growing at about the same pace registered
in August.
Growth in M2 and M3 picked up in August to annual rates of about 8 percent
and 12 percent, respectively, returning to the pace of the first quarter of the year after
a lull in early summer. M2 was boosted by inflows to retail money market funds,
which surged to an annual growth rate of about 33 percent in August and constituted
two-thirds of the increase in seasonally adjusted M2. Preliminary data indicate that
the sizable inflows continued in the first weeks of September when the equity market
continued to experience sizable gyrations. Other components of the monetary
aggregates, which are less likely to receive outflows from equity mutual funds, did not
show unusual growth in August. Within the non-M2 components of M3, institution-
only money funds grew at an annual rate of nearly 37 percent in August, a sharp
turnaround from July but not higher than the growth rates seen in many recent months.
Growth in large time deposits and RPs was also robust, helping to fund the rapid
expansion in bank credit.

The value of exports dropped 1.3 percent in July, primarily a result of decreases in
the value of automotive products to Canada and Mexico (a temporary move largely in
response to the strike at GM). While exports of consumer goods and industrial supplies
moved below average levels recorded in the second quarter, deliveries of aircraft picked
up in July to the highest level recorded in more than a year. Exports of machinery held at
about June (and Q2 average) levels. There was little change in July in the level of
exports to most key countries in Asia.
The value of imports declined 0.8 percent in July. A sharp decrease in imports of
vehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico (also a temporary effect of the strike at GM)
accounted for much of the decline. Imports of automotive products from other countries
declined as well, helped by a sharp drop in imports from Korea (the result of a strike
there). Imported consumer goods held at second-quarter average levels in July as did
non-oil industrial supplies. For industrial supplies, strengthening imports of steel were
offset by reductions in other materials. The value of imported oil in July was less than in
June (and the Q2 average); the decline in July was attributable to a drop in price that
exceeded the increase in quantity.

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
Oil imports and prices. The quantity of imported oil rose between June and July
to a rate that was just under the average recorded in the second quarter. Imports had risen
9 percent during 1998-Q2 to a rate of 11.8 mb/d primarily due to an acceleration in
stockbuilding, strong consumption and a decline in production. Preliminary Department
of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports remained robust in August, primarily
reflecting strong consumption.
The price of imported oil increased 0.3 percent in August, the first rise since May.
The import price had risen slightly in April and May, following cuts in production by
OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and dropped significantly in June and July following
reports of surprisingly high levels of oil stocks and a sharp downward revision in
estimates of Asian oil consumption. For July-August combined, prices of imported oil
declined 21 percent at an annual rate, somewhat less than the decline recorded in the
second quarter.
The spot price for WTI fell back below $13/b in mid-August because of larger-
than-expected shipments from Iraq and market disappointment over the pace of
production cutbacks from the other OPEC producers. Weak oil demand, particularly in
Asia, also contributed to the soft market. Spot WTI has risen thus far in September as
OPEC further tightened its production restraints and Iraq announced that it will be unable
to maintain its August pace of oil shipments. Several temporary factors have lifted oil
prices as well. Storms in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico have shut down oil
production intermittently, disturbances in Nigeria have forced cut-backs in liftings, and
the maintenance season in the North Sea has resulted in larger production cutbacks of
longer duration than the market expected.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports decreased 0.3 percent in August.
Declines were recorded in prices of all major categories of imports, with the greatest
declines in prices of foods and computers. For July-August combined, the decline in
prices of non-oil imports was 4.1 percent at an annual rate, a bit more than in the
preceding quarter. Notable price declines were recorded in all major trade categories with
the exception of imported consumer goods and automotive products, each of which
decreased only 1.3 percent at an annual rate.
Prices of agricultural exports resumed declining in August. For July-August
combined, agricultural export prices decreased 5 percent at an annual rate, a smaller rate
of decline than in the preceding four quarters. Sagging demand from foreign customers
and robust world production have placed downward pressure on prices of agricultural
exports.IV-4

IV-6 Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
The price of nonagricultural exports decreased marginally in August. For July-
August combined, these prices declined at a 3 percent annual rate, about the same rate of
decline recorded in the second quarter; the sharpest decreases were in industrial supplies,
computers, and semiconductors. Price declines for exported consumer goods and "core"
capital goods were less than 1 percent at an annual rate. Prices of exported automotive
products increased slightly in July-August.
U.S. Current Account. The U.S. current account deficit widened to $226.1
billion (SAAR) in the second quarter. The bulk of the increase was due to a substantially
larger deficit on goods and services, as exports fell sharply and imports continued to rise.
The deficit on investment income also rose; income receipts on U.S. assets abroad were
unchanged, while income payments on foreign assets increased modestly. Net unilateral
transfers rose slightly, as U.S. government grants edged down.

International Developments
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserve assets in the United States declined further in July,
accelerating the outflow seen in the second quarter (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table). Declines by China-both Mainland and Hong
Kong-and Singapore more than account for the nearly $6 billion reduction shown for
"other" countries in line 1c. OPEC reserves in the United States also declined
significantly in July.
Partial data for August and the first half of September from the FRBNY show a
significant further decline-of approximately $30 billion-in foreign reserves in the United
States. With the exception of most industrialized countries in Europe, nearly all countries
registered some reduction. The largest of these were in OPEC, greater China, and Russia.
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. securities slowed markedly in July as
Treasury transactions swung to net sales and net bond purchases slowed (line 4). Most of
the net sales of Treasuries in July (line 4a) were attributable to transactions with financial
centers in the United Kingdom and the Caribbean. There were small net purchases of
Treasuries recorded against most Asian economies with the exception of Japan, which
registered small net sales.
Reduced foreign purchases of bonds (line 4b) reflect declines in foreign purchases
of both corporate and government-sponsored agency bonds. Foreign purchases of
agencies, which had averaged more than $6 billion per month during the first half of the
year, dropped to $1 billion in July. Foreign net purchases of U.S. equities in July were
little changed from June (line 4c); continued net sales from Asia were more than offset
by continued net purchases from Europe.
U.S. net purchases of foreign securities slowed markedly in July (line 5), as bond
transactions swung from significant net purchases to net sales. The swing in bond
transactions was widespread throughout Europe and Asia. The only region recording an
increase in net purchases was Latin America and the Caribbean. In contrast to bonds,
U.S. transactions in foreign equities swung from net sales in June to net purchases in July
(line 5b). Transactions in Europe account for most of this swing; however, U.S. residents
also resumed purchasing equities in Japan in July, after recording net sales in June.
Net capital inflows through bank transactions picked up further in July (line 3).
The inflow was more than attributable to interbank transactions with unaffiliated
foreigners. On a monthly average basis, banks' net claims on own foreign offices and
IBFs were little changed in July (See line 1 of the International Banking Data table).IV-7

IV-10 Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
In August, however, U.S. banking offices reduced their net claims on own foreign offices
and IBFs by about $10 billion.
Recently released balance of payments data for the second quarter show a slight
slowing in foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7 of the Summary table).
Nevertheless, the pace of direct investment inflows remains near last year's record pace.
Boosted by several large takeovers, U.S. foreign direct investment abroad picked up even
further in the second quarter (line 6) and remains well above last year's record pace.
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international accounts was negative $9 1/2
billion in the second quarter, indicating some combination of over-recorded net capital
inflows or under-recorded net exports (last line of the Summary table). Though still
significant, the discrepancy so far this year is much smaller than that recorded in the
previous two years.
Foreign Exchange Market
Volatility in world financial markets has risen further since the August 18 FOMC
meeting. The August 17 announcement by the Russian government of a suspension of
payments on ruble-denominated debt and of an effective devaluation of the ruble ushered
in a period of turmoil that spread to other emerging-markets. The protracted debate
between the LDP and opposition parties in the face of deteriorating domestic economic
conditions in Japan also contributed to an overall concern about the depth of the
economic slowdown in Japan and elsewhere. Equity prices in most industrialized and
developing countries declined sharply. The price of emerging market debt issues,
particularly in Latin America, fell precipitously, as investors sought refuge in government
bonds of major industrial countries; as a result, government bond yields fell to new
historical lows in most industrial countries. There was also increased pressure on many
currencies, first in the Asia-Pacific region and later in Latin America and Northern
Europe. Towards the end of the period, widespread speculation about the timing of
possible actions to ease monetary policy by the United States and other major industrial
countries appeared to be the main factor driving asset price movements. Numerous
rumors, also towards the end of the period, of possible aid packages for Latin American
countries led to a partial recovery in the value of Latin American assets.
Since the August FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of
the dollar has depreciated 4 percent, on average, against the 16 major currencies in our
narrow index. Over the same time period, the dollar has appreciated 1/2 percent, on
average, against the currencies of other important trading partners in our 29-currency
broad index, yielding an overall depreciation of 2 percent in the broad index. With

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
respect to specific currencies, the dollar depreciated 6 1/2 percent in terms of the yen, 6
percent in terms of the mark, and 4 percent against sterling.
Three main factors are thought to have influenced the exchange value of the dollar
during the intermeeting period. First, the exposure of the United States to Latin
American markets was seen as greater than that of other major industrial nations.
Second, particularly after Chairman Greenspan's September 4 speech, most market
participants seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve was likely to move to lower
interest rates before the end of the year. The central banks of other industrial nations
appeared either less likely to match the rate cut or, at the very least, less likely to match
the timing of the Federal Reserve. Consistent with that view, the spread between U.S.
and German 10-year bond yields declined 21 basis points in the intermeeting period.
Third, uncertainty about President Clinton's political future appeared to weigh on the
dollar in the later part of the period.
While concerns about trade imbalances in the United States and Japan may
have arisen at times during the period, the extent of the appreciation of the yen against the
dollar was somewhat puzzling in light of the deepening recession of the Japanese
economy and of the severity of its banking sector crisis. Market commentary cited
threats of intervention in support of the yen by various Japanese government officials,
rumors that Japanese companies were repatriating large amounts of assets in preparation
for the end of the fiscal half-year on September 30, and other rumors that many investors
who had financed their investments in emerging markets by borrowing yen were closing
their positions and buying yen to repay their loans. The surprise announcement on
September 9 by the Bank of Japan that they would guide their overnight call rate from
slightly below percent to percent resulted in only a temporary reversal of the yen's
trend. The yen's rise in value against the dollar appeared to be an important factor in the
diminishing pressure on some of the pegged currencies in Asia, particularly the Hong
Kong dollar and the Chinese renminbi, towards the later part of the period. The exchange
value of the dollar against other floating currencies in Asia was mixed, as the dollar
appreciated 5 percent against the Korean won but depreciated 3 1/4 percent against the Thai
baht. On September 1, Malaysia chose to adopt capital controls and to peg the value of
the ringgitt to the dollar; there were concerns that other countries in the region may
follow suit.
Contributing to the dollar's depreciation against the mark were statements by
several Bundesbank officials, in the weeks following Chairman Greenspan's September 4
speech, indicating that they did not believe a German rate cut to be warranted. MostIV-12

International Developments
market analysts also came to believe that the effective exposure of German banks to the
Russian crisis was not as large as had been feared initially. Other euro-zone currencies
followed the mark's movement, with the strain on currencies reflected in a few sporadic
intervention operations and in small movements in spreads of government bond yields
relative to German bunds. The exchange value of the British pound, which rose less
against the dollar than most European currencies, was affected by the release of data
showing slower growth and a diminished inflation threat in the United Kingdom; this
increased the perceived likelihood of a future monetary easing by the Bank of England.
Some other European currencies outside of the euro-zone, particularly in Scandinavia,
also came under pressure. The Norwegian krone, which was affected by low oil prices,
depreciated about 4 percent against the mark
The exchange value of the
dollar in terms of the Canadian dollar was little changed on balance.
Moody's September 3 downgrade of the foreign-currency debt ratings of Brazil
and Venezuela and its placement of the debt of Mexico and Argentina on review
reinforced the already pessimistic outlook about the region's financial stability. The
Mexican peso, affected by low oil prices and concerns about neighboring Latin American
economies, found little support in soaring cete rates and repeated auctions of dollars by
the central bank, with the dollar up 8 1/2 percent against the peso during the period.
.Vast capital outflows were
reported in Brazil despite large increases in policy interest rates; Brazil's daily capital
outflows at times topped $2 billion but slowed significantly by the third week of
September, as numerous unconfirmed rumors circulated of a large international lending
package prepared by G-7 nations, led by the United States, and international financial
organizations. Columbia and Ecuador devalued their currencies on September 2 and 13,
respectively. There was widespread market commentary that the Venezuelan bolivar,
under additional pressure from low oil prices and a difficult political situation, would
soon have to be devalued.IV-13

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
In Russia, the exchange rate of the ruble was difficult to assess with certainty
since quotes originated in a very illiquid market, but a depreciation of at least 50 percent
versus the dollar since August 17 was evident.
Equity prices in many of the world's markets have fallen significantly since the
last FOMC meeting, in sessions often marked by extreme volatility. Immediately after
the Russian debt problems intensified, share prices of financial sector firms in most
industrial economies declined, as investors attempted to gauge the exposure of various
institutions. Later, concerns about future earnings of corporations faced with declining
world demand appeared to be driving equity prices lower. In Asia, Japanese share prices
declined more than 6 1/2 percent from already extremely depressed levels. Hong Kong
share prices rose 4 percent, supported by unusual equity purchase operations by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority. Share prices in many other Asian markets fell, particularly in
Indonesia and the Philippines. European equity indexes fell 10 1/2 percent (United
Kingdom) to 19 percent (Spain -- where prices were most affected by losses in Latin
America). Canadian share prices fell 8 1/2 percent. Latin American equity price were the
most volatile; the Brazilian Bovespa and the Argentine Merval lost over 21 percent, but
the Mexican Bolsa gained 2 1/2 percent.
Nowhere was the flight-to-quality theme more evident than in bond markets, with
soaring yields on most emerging-market sovereign issues standing in contrast to record-
low yields on Japanese, Canadian, European and U.S. government bonds. The yield
spreads over Treasury securities of most Latin American Brady bonds had widened over
500 basis points by mid-September, but bond prices retraced some of their losses late in
the period. Yield spreads of Asian dollar-denominated debt also widened to levels
exceeding those of last fall. The collapse of Russian financial markets was evidenced by
an increase in the yield spread of the Russian dollar-denominated Prin bond of more than
3000 basis points. In the major foreign industrial economies, yields on bellwether
government bond issues generally fell 25 to 55 basis points. German and Japanese bond
yields fell 45 and 41 basis points, respectively, reaching new historical lows during the
period. In addition, the yield spreads between core and periphery euro-zone countries
widened during the intermeeting period; the spread between Italian and German 10-year
bellwether issues increased 11 basis points to 47 basis points.

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data on second-quarter real activity show that the Japanese economy contracted
for the third consecutive quarter, hit once again by declining business fixed investment.
Available current-quarter data indicate further contraction. European economies felt the
effect of the Asian crisis in the second quarter, as a deterioration in net exports offset
continued strength in domestic demand. German economic activity slowed sharply in the
second quarter, but the slowdown was exaggerated by temporary factors that had raised
first-quarter growth at the expense of the second quarter. July orders data indicate a
forthcoming deterioration in export growth. Canadian economic activity slowed in the
second quarter, partly from the effects of the GM strike and Canadian construction
strikes. Recent data on employment and retail sales are also consistent with a slowing
economy.
Inflation pressures have eased further in most foreign industrial countries, with
inflation falling to zero in Japan. U.K. inflation has met the government's inflation target
of 2 1/2 percent for the first time since January. Easing inflation pressures and a slowing
U.K. economy have contributed to a recent indication by the Bank of England that a
future easing of monetary policy is becoming more likely.
Individual country notes. In Japan, real GDP contracted 3.3 percent (SAAR)
during the second quarter, with total domestic demand plunging 6.2 percent. Business
fixed investment dropped 20 percent for the second consecutive quarter. Private
consumption and residential investment also declined. Public demand subtracted another
1/4 percentage point from growth, with a 2.6 percent drop in government consumption
more than offsetting a slight increase in public investment. The decline in domestic
demand was offset partially by a 2.9 percentage point contribution from net exports, as
exports fell but imports collapsed. GDP during the second quarter was down 4.5 percent
from its peak during the first quarter of 1997.
Economic indicators for the third quarter suggest that the economy continues to
contract. Unemployment eased a bit in July, but the ratio of offers to applicants fell to
0.50, the lowest level in over 30 years. Industrial production in July declined 0.6 percent
from June and was down slightly from the very weak second-quarter average. Household
expenditure, retail sales, housing starts, and machinery orders also registered large
declines during July.IV-16

Japan's current account surplus during the first seven months of the year was
$113.5 billion at an annual rate, up from $94.2 billion during 1997. Merchandise exports
(valued in dollars) are down 7.5 percent from the 1997 average, but imports have fallen
16.6 percent.
On September 9, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) cut the overnight call-money target to
0.25 percent. The target previously had been set at "slightly below the official discount
rate" of 0.5 percent; in recent months, the BOJ had allowed the call-money rate to
fluctuate between 40-45 basis points. In a statement explaining the action, the BOJ
indicated the rate cut was necessary "to ensure the economy does not worsen further and
to prevent the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral." The BOJ also indicated
that if circumstances in financial markets were to become more severe, the BOJ would
provide large liquidity injections, even if such action caused the call-money rate to fall
below the announced target.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has conducted extended negotiations
with the major opposition parties regarding the content of banking legislation. Both sides
agree that depositors should be protected using public funds and that efforts should be
made to minimize systemic consequences from bank failures. In particular, there is
agreement that healthy customers of insolvent banks should continue to have access to
liquidity. In addition, the two sides have determined to establish an "emergency financialIV-17

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
sector rehabilitation committee" that would be given power to identify failed banks and to
respond either by appointing a receiver or by "nationalizing" the bank through the
purchase of outstanding shares. On September 18, the two sides announced the outline of
a compromise that would place LTCB under state control (rather than injecting capital
into the bank), scrap previous legislation that allocated ¥13 trillion for open bank
assistance, and strip the Ministry of Finance of its policymaking functions with respect to
the financial sector. The agreement, however, was subsequently called into question as
some LDP officials suggested that LTCB might be given public funds before the new
legislation is actually approved. The two sides will continue negotiations in an effort to
resolve remaining points of dispute.

FY 1998 that should include at least ¥4 trillion of new "real water" expenditures. Early
indications suggest, however, that the initial FY 1999 budget may be as contractionary as the
original FY 1998 budget.IV-18

International Developments
Real economic activity in most of the eleven countries scheduled to enter European
Monetary Union next year continued to expand in the second quarter, although more slowly
than in the first quarter. The average unemployment rate continued to fall in most countries,
and consumer price inflation remained quiescent across the EMU area. Third quarter
indicators, which are scant, point to modest growth. In July, both consumer confidence and
business sentiment remained close to their averages in the second quarter.

Real GDP growth in Germany dropped back sharply in the second quarter to 0.4
percent (SAAR) from an upwardly revised 5.9 percent pace in the first quarter. Domestic
demand also was nearly flat during the second quarter, as private consumption and
investment expenditure declined. Industrial production, excluding construction, was
unchanged, following a strong surge in the first quarter; including construction, industrial
production fell 0.7 percent in the second quarter. Both exports and imports expanded
sharply, but their net contribution to second-quarter growth was zero. Government
consumption and inventories, a residual, were the only components that made positive
contributions to GDP in the second quarter.IV-19

1. Annual changes are Q4/Q4
The marked slowdown in second-quarter growth has been attributed to two factors.
First, in anticipation of an increase at the beginning of April in the value-added tax (by
1 percentage point), consumption expenditures were shifted forward. Second, unusually
warm first-quarter weather boosted construction, but led to a payback in the second quarter.
Nevertheless, construction spending averaged over the first half of the year was below 1997
levels and continues the downtrend seen since 1995. Although July construction, as
measured by the IP index, has rebounded smartly, the government cautioned that the most
recent IP estimate likely is biased upward by a seasonal adjustment problem.
Forward-looking indicators suggest some slowing of export growth ahead.
Manufacturing orders by foreigners (not shown in table) edged down a bit in July and have
been roughly constant since the second half of last year. Other indicators are mixed.
Business confidence (as measured by the IFO survey) has been falling over the past several
months, but domestic manufacturing orders (not shown) in the first half of 1998 are up over
3 percent from the second half of 1997, and capacity utilization -- already high -- has risen
further over the past half year.
The August CPI showed inflation (on a 12-month basis) at less than 1 percent, a bit
lower than in July. The deceleration was more pronounced in Western Germany. Producer
prices (not shown) have fallen nearly 0.4 percent over the year ending July.IV-20

In France, real GDP rose 2.8 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter, after increasing
2.4 percent in the first quarter. Domestic demand remained robust with private consumption
contributing a surprisingly strong 2.4 percentage points. However, much of the strength in
private consumption is attributed to the volatile food and energy sectors. Although housing
investment took off, fixed investment slowed considerably to 3.7 percent growth from the
exceptionally strong 7.8 percent growth registered in the first quarter. Housing seems poised
for continued strength during the remainder of the year, given historically low interest rates
and higher real incomes. A rundown in inventories contributed negatively following the first
quarter's significant build-up, possibly due to the phase-out of the tax incentive on auto
purchases. The data are also consistent with continued transition from export-oriented to
domestic demand-led growth: Exports stalled in the third quarter, and despite a slowdown in
imports, net exports subtracted almost a full percentage point from growth.
Third-quarter data are very limited but suggest continued growth; in July consumer
confidence reached record-high levels, and the business outlook remained optimistic.IV-21

projects a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP. Spending would increase by 1 percent in real
terms, whereas receipts would increase roughly by 1 1/2 percent (despite a projected 1/2
percent cut in taxes). Achieving the 1999 deficit target not only will require tight control
over social security spending (this year's social security budget has overshot and
emergency measures have been agreed upon), but also will require the economy to
escape with relatively minor effects from the current global financial market turmoil.
In Italy, real economic activity rose modestly in the second quarter. Available
data indicate that household consumption, business fixed investment and net exports, as
well as calendar effects, contributed positively to second-quarter growth. The rise in
private consumption likely reflects the transition to durable goods consumption from
non-durables (which were stimulated by the government's recently expired tax-incentive
scheme on auto purchases). The rise in net exports suggests that stronger foreign
demand from Europe offset, to some degree, the negative effects of weaker demand from
Asia. Third-quarter data are limited and mixed; consumer confidence declined in July-
September while industrial production rose in July.

Inflation remains low and stable. Data from eleven cities indicate that consumer
price inflation was 1.8 percent in September, unchanged from its second-quarter
average.
On September 12, Treasury Minister Ciampi announced that the government's
1999 budget would not be revised despite less optimistic growth projections this year.
(The government forecasts a 2 1/2 percent (yr/yr) increase in real GDP this year, although
most consensus forecasters now view that figure as unattainable.) With next year's
budget, the government hopes to improve fiscal balances by $7.7 billion equivalent
(approximately 1/2 percent of GDP), about two-thirds of which will come from spending
cuts and one-third from new revenue. Prime Minister Prodi aims to present the 1999
budget to parliament on September 29. The parliament will have until the end of the
year to ratify the government's proposal.
In the United Kingdom, real GDP expanded 2 percent (SAAR) in the second
quarter, little changed from the pace in the first quarter. Consumption expenditures
increased 3 percent, somewhat weaker than in the first quarter and well below the
average quarterly increase last year. Investment spending declined, after surging the
previous quarter. Net exports subtracted from growth as imports grew more rapidly than
exports, and inventory accumulation contributed 1 percentage point to growth.
Indicators for the third quarter are limited but suggest that growth has been
slowing. Industrial production picked up somewhat in July, but manufacturing outputIV-24

was essentially unchanged. Business confidence in manufacturing, as measured by
output expectations from the Confederation of British Industry's Industrial Trends
Survey, has fallen sharply in recent months to levels last seen in 1992, reflecting
concerns about both domestic and export demand. Survey data suggest that service
industries continued to expand in July and August, but at a slower pace than in the first
half of the year. The average volume of retail sales in July and August was up 0.8
percent from the second quarter.
Conditions in the labor market have continued to tighten in recent months. The
official claims-based unemployment rate moved lower to 4.6 percent in August.
Average annual earnings growth fell back to 4.7 percent in June, after peaking at
5.4 percent in April. Although some of the recent increase in earnings reflects bonus
payments that are spread unevenly through the year, the Bank of England noted in the
August Inflation Report that recent earnings data suggest that "unemployment has
reached a level likely to prove incompatible with price stability." The twelve-month rate
of British retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) was 2.5 percent
in August, meeting the inflation target for the first time since January.IV-25

In Canada, recent data indicate a slowing in growth. GDP in the second quarter
was up only 1.8 percent (SAAR). Some of this slowdown reflects the impact of the GM
shutdown as well as construction strikes in Ontario. Resolution of these strikes should
lead to a shift in production into the third and fourth quarters of this year, but other
factors suggest a more pervasive slowdown. These include weak retail sales in June, a
slight drop in personal income after taxes in the second quarter, and declines in
manufacturing shipments and new orders throughout the summer.
Recent employment data also indicates slower growth. Employment through
August was up only 0.4 percent (SAAR) from its level in April. While manufacturing
employment has been particularly weak, fairly strong employment growth in service
sector jobs, most likely due to the upturn in tourism, has offset declines in
manufacturing. As a result of these overall modest employment gains, the
unemployment rate fell slightly in August to 8.3 percent.
The trade surplus fell to $2.9 billion in the second quarter from $3.2 billion in the
previous quarter, despite the past year's depreciation of the Canadian dollar. While
exports remained flat in the second quarter, imports experienced modest gains.IV-26

For the first half of 1998 compared with the first half of 1997, roughly two-thirds of the
$10 billion (AR) narrowing in the Canadian trade surplus represents a deterioration in
trade with Asia (primarily Japan).
Although declines in the Canadian dollar have created some additional upward
price pressure in recent months, inflation in Canada remains subdued and at the bottom
of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target range.
Despite the low inflation outlook and slower growth, the Bank of Canada raised
its Bank Rate 100 basis points on August 27. The Bank's decision was driven by the
Canadian dollar's fall to record lows in August against the U.S. dollar. Another factor
contributing to the Bank's decision was a broad selloff of Canadian assets in August that
led to a sharp rise in the spread between Canadian and U.S. long-term rates. Although
the rate hike is expected to be a further drag on an already slowing economy, it has
contributed to a moderate turnaround of the Canadian dollar and a reduction in long-
term rates relative to U.S. rates.IV-27

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity has weakened in most emerging market economies, with
output declining in Korea, Hong Kong, Russia, and the ASEAN countries and the pace
of growth slowing in Mexico and Argentina. Inflation remains low to moderate in most
countries, with notable exceptions being Indonesia and Venezuela, and, since August,
Russia. The general adjustment toward surpluses in external balances in Asia continued,
whereas in Latin America external deficits have generally widened.
In mid-August, the Russian ruble was devalued, and the government announced
a restructuring of its short-term debt and a 90-day moratorium on private external debt
service. Subsequently, turmoil spread to Latin American financial markets: Latin stock
markets have tumbled, and Brady spreads and domestic interest rates have risen sharply
since mid-August. The contagion effects from the Russian devaluation have fueled
currency pressures in several Latin American countries, especially Brazil, as well as in
Hong Kong. In several other Asian countries, currencies have stabilized.
Individual country notes. In Korea, real GDP extended its first-quarter
decline in the second quarter, and preliminary indicators suggest further deterioration in
the third quarter. Real GDP fell 6.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.8 percent drop on this basis in the first quarter. The decline in the
second quarter from the previous quarter is estimated at about 3.5 percent (SAAR),
considerably slower than the estimated 23 percent rate of decline in the first quarter.
Early indicators point to further weakness in the third quarter. In July, industrial
production fell nearly 13 percent from a year earlier, and the average factory operation
rate dropped to 64 percent as domestic construction orders and retail sales also continued
to weaken. In August, heavy flooding and a strike at Hyundai motors likely further
depressed activity. Reflecting this weak activity, the inflation rate has continued to ease,
with the 12-month consumer price inflation rate moving below 7 percent in August.
Korea's current account was in surplus by $44 billion (AR) in the first seven
months of the year. This rise represents a positive swing of $62 billion from the $18
billion deficit rate recorded in the corresponding period last year. The won's relative
strength, along with the continued weakness of activity, has led the monetary authorities
to lower interest rates further, with the overnight rate moving down to about 8 percent.IV-32

Additional actions toward restructuring the banking system have been made in
recent weeks. Two new bank mergers have been announced, including one which would
create the country's largest bank. In addition, the Financial Supervisory Commission
has indicated that the government would provide $3.3 billion (in the form of increased
capital and purchases of bad loans) to support a previously announced bank merger.
Despite these actions, it is still unclear if the government's overall provision of resources
to facilitate bank restructuring will be adequate, especially given the limited role up to
now of the private sector-especially foreign-in bank recapitalization.
In the ASEAN region, weakening domestic demand, tight credit conditions, and
Japan's worsening economy continued to dampen economic activity. Malaysia's GDP is
estimated to have fallen 7.4 percent in the second quarter of 1998 (SAAR), although this
represents a much slower decline than in the first quarter. Industrial production fell
steeply in Singapore in July, although in Malaysia and Thailand, seasonally adjusted
figures indicate that industrial production may have bottomed out.IV-33

On September 1, Malaysia introduced exchange controls and put in place
measures requiring ringgit held overseas to be returned to Malaysia before the end of the
month. The new rules mean that non-residents who purchased ringgit securities before
September 1 of this year will have to keep their funds in Malaysia until at least
September 1, 1999. Non-residents who purchase a ringgit security after September 1 of
this year will have to keep their funds in Malaysia for at least one year after the date of
purchase. Shortly after introducing controls, Malaysia fixed its exchange rate at 3.8
ringgit per dollar, and Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was
sacked from government by Prime Minister Mahathir, and later arrested.
Indonesia and Thailand announced major plans for bank restructuring, including
the closing of some banks and nationalizing of others. A new tougher bankruptcy law
went into effect in Indonesia which is designed to give creditors more power to force
debtors to restructure and pay off their debts. Thailand's government, along with major
foreign and domestic creditors, agreed upon a framework for restructuring corporate debt
with an emphasis on rehabilitating debtors.
In Hong Kong, government officials have indicated that they expect GDP in the
second quarter of 1998 to be about 5 percent below its year-earlier level, which staff
estimates is consistent with decline of 3 to 4 percent SAAR. Unemployment continued
to rise, reaching 5 percent in the June-August period. Reflecting weak imports, Hong
Kong's merchandise trade deficit in the first seven months of 1998 has narrowed to
$15 billion from $20 billion over the same period of 1997. Data released in August on
the components of GDP in the first quarter do suggest, however, that the improvement in
merchandise trade has been offset somewhat by a deterioration in net services exports.IV-35

Part 2: Recent Developments, September 23, 1998
In mid-August, Hong Kong's currency peg came under renewed speculative
pressure, and stock prices declined sharply. Hong Kong authorities attributed the
declines to a so-called "double-play" by speculators who simultaneously shorted the
stock market and sold the currency. The speculators' hope was that the currency attack
would force interest rates upwards, causing the stock market to fall, even if the currency
peg was maintained. In response, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) spent
an estimated $10-15 billion buying stocks in the second half of August, hoping to ensure
that speculators lost money when most of their short-sales contracts expired on
August 28. Between August 13 and 28, the stock market rose nearly 20 percent, and
authorities claimed success over speculators; recently the HKMA has ceased
intervention in the stock market and stock prices have declined somewhat. Hong Kong's
foreign exchange reserves were $97 billion at the end of July, but are now estimated to
be less than $80 billion.

In early September, the HKMA announced a set of technical adjustments to the
operation of Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar, which it argues strengthen the
peg by removing some HKMA discretion and by increasing interbank activity. These
adjustments include several measures that appear to make it easier for banks to borrow
from the discount window. This increased access is expected to make it easier for banks
to obtain liquidity when needed, thereby limiting volatility in short-term interest rates.
Additionally, all banks will now be allowed to convert clearing balances (essentially,
Hong Kong bank reserves) into foreign currency with the HKMA, rather than having to
exchange currency in the market, and the HKMA has pledged to increase transparency
by making balance-sheet information available as quickly as possible.IV-36

In China, industrial production remained relatively weak in August, and
consumer prices continued to decline. In recent months, China has suffered widespread
flooding, reportedly the worst since 1954, and these floods are expected to have an
adverse effect on output in 1998H2. Net exports remained strong, reflecting weak
import growth. In the first eight months, exports rose 5 1/2 percent compared with the

In Mexico, economic activity has begun to show signs of decelerating. Recent
data indicate that real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter to 4.3 percent. The
slowdown was evident in the construction sector, which has been hit hard by public
sector budget cuts and a reduction in government spending on investment.

The trade deficit was sizeable again in August as oil prices remained low.
Consumer prices increased 15.5 percent in August over a year ago and inflationary
expectations, as reported by the Bank of Mexico, have been revised upward. The
collapse of the Russian ruble and its reverberations in international financial markets
during the past month has caused sharp declines in the peso and stock prices; the 28-day
Cetes interest rate increased by about 25 percentage points, but subsequently receded 10
percentage points, with the Brady spreads moving in tandem. Continued price pressures
and volatility in the foreign exchange market has prompted the Bank of Mexico to
tighten monetary policy, introducing several changes to help control monetary
conditions.
Brazilian financial markets have been hit hard over the past few weeks by
repercussions from the financial turmoil in Russia. Since mid-August, the spread on
Brazilian Brady par bonds over U.S. Treasuries has increased precipitously. The
Bovespa stock price index has plunged. Net private capital outflows have been strongly
negative. To defend the currency, the real, the central bank has spent at least $20 billionIV-38

of its reserves since mid-August; as of September 20, reserves stood at an estimated
$47 billion, down from a peak of $70 billion at the end of July. In early September, the
central bank raised the overnight borrowing rate from 20 to 30 percent, and then to
50 percent on September 10, after witnessing a 15 percent drop for the day in the
Bovespa index. Stock market prices and Brady bonds recovered some of their previous
losses in mid-September, fueled in part by hopes that Brazil will be receiving
substantial assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors.

Downward pressures on the currency have been fueled by Brazil's persistently
large fiscal deficit (about 7 percent of GDP) and current account deficit (about 3 1/2 -4
percent of GDP). The Brazilian government has announced two budget cuts for 1998
totaling about 1/2 percent of GDP and further cuts down the road. These announcements
have failed to impress market observers, who want to see more dramatic steps. It will be
very difficult for President Cardoso to take unpopular steps to reduce the budget deficit
before the October 3 presidential elections, in which he is considered the front-runner.
The interest rate increase, if prolonged, will further depress the Brazilian
economy, which has been struggling to recover from the downturn in the first quarter of
1998. Unemployment has been high by historical standards, at 8 percent, and industrial
output declined considerably in July. The interest rate rise will also greatly increase the
government's cost of servicing its debt, particularly since about 70 percent of the federal
government's domestic securities (or about $200 billion) are indexed to the overnight
interbank rate.IV-39

In Argentina, second-quarter real GDP grew by nearly 7 percent from a year
earlier. This represents only a slight slowing in the pace of growth in the first half of the
year, compared with last year. However, industrial production data indicate that growth
has decelerated further in the second half of the year; industrial production grew only
1.7 percent and 0.7 percent over the preceding 12-months in July and August,
respectively, compared with an average of over 5 percent in the second quarter. Inflation
remained low and the 12-month consumer price inflation rate was slightly over 1 percent
in August. With exports falling nearly 2 percent from a year ago in July, external
balances, which had been narrowing in general earlier this year, have widened again: the
cumulative trade deficit through July this year was about $3 billion (AR), compared with
slightly over $1 billion (AR) over the same period in 1997.
Financial markets in Argentina have been hit hard since the August devaluation
of the Russian ruble. Since mid-August, Argentine stocks have plunged about
25 percent and Brady spreads have increased sharply; and the rate on 30-day peso
deposits has roughly doubled. However, in contrast to the "Tequila" crisis of 1995, so
far at least, international reserves and deposits have been almost unaffected:
international reserves (excluding gold) stood at about $24 billion on September 18,
roughly unchanged from their mid-August level.

The Argentine congress passed two reform bills in September. One provides for
tax reforms, which the IMF has been pressing for under its $2.8 billion Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) with Argentina. The second is a labor reform bill; this bill fallsIV-40

considerably short of the commitments made to the IMF under the EFF. The upper
house of congress also passed another landmark measure dubbed "fiscal convertibility,"
which would prohibit budget deficits of more than 2 percent of GDP and restrict yearly
growth in domestic debt to 1 percent of GDP. This bill now awaits approval by the
lower house.
The Venezuelan economy is moving into a sharp recession, as evidenced by a
decline in oil exports due to the slump in world oil prices, rising unemployment, soaring
interest rates, and plunging auto sales, which declined nearly 30 percent in August from
a year earlier. Inflation is running high, with the 12-month inflation rate in August at
over 35 percent. Weak oil prices and an overvalued currency have turned a current
account surplus of about $6 billion in 1997 to a surplus of only $1.5 billion (AR) in the
first quarter and a slight deficit in the second quarter.

With an already troubled economy, an overvalued currency, a widening fiscal
deficit, and considerable political uncertainty, contagion effects arising since the
devaluation of the Russian ruble have had a big impact on Venezuelan financial markets.
The stock market has declined by about 25 percent since mid-August. Brady spreads
rose sharply from 1300 basis points to over 2500 basis points between mid-August and
early September, but have recovered partially since then. The domestic interest rate on
90-day commercial bank deposits has risen nearly three-fold since the start of the year.
International reserves (excluding gold) were about $10 billion on September 17, down
by about $4 billion since the start of the year.IV-41

Populist candidate Hugo Chavez is still comfortably the front-runner candidate
for the December presidential elections, according to polls. Although Chavez has
recently been toning down somewhat his radical and anti-market policy positions, it is
still very uncertain what directions macroeconomic policy would take if he is elected.
The Russian economy entered a new period of crisis on August 17, as the
government effectively devalued the ruble and announced a 90-day moratorium on
private external debt service along with a unilateral restructuring of short-term domestic
debt. The debt restructuring, which was supposed to be completed by September 26,
offered investors a 5 percent cash payment along with options for exchanging the
remaining debt for a mixture of ruble and dollar-denominated bonds. The terms were
widely viewed as implying sizable losses for investors. Foreign investors are also
concerned that domestic banks are getting a better deal, as they will reportedly be
allowed to swap some of the frozen bonds to the Central Bank to replenish reserves
drawn down under a plan to inject liquidity into the banking system. Acting Finance
Minister Zadomov is meeting with foreign investors this week, and new terms for the
restructuring are expected to be offered soon.
At the time that the restructuring was announced, the government maintained that
it would continue to meet all other obligations, including sovereign debt inherited from
the Soviet Union. However, last week the government reportedly missed some of its
payments to Paris Club members, and concerns have been expressed about its ability to
meet interest payments due later this year and next, particularly in the absence of further
international assistance. The IMF is still considering what criteria Russia must meet to
obtain a second, $4.3 billion, tranche of an IMF-led $22.6 billion aid package,
$4.8 billion of which was disbursed in July and largely spent in a futile attempt to defend
the ruble. (The second tranche had been scheduled for mid-September.) Both the IMF
and the G-7 governments have indicated that any further aid will be conditioned on
continued economic reform.
However, recent reports suggest that the new government will place a higher
priority on social welfare and support for domestic industry than on macroeconomic
stabilization, at least in the short run. The financial crisis led to the ouster of Sergei
Kiriyenko as prime minister, as well as the resignation of Sergei Dubinin as chief of the
central bank. Following two failed attempts to reinstate Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister, Yeltsin turned to foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was easily
confirmed by the Duma. Although financial markets welcomed the resolution of the
political crisis, concerns about the future course of economic policy were raised by theIV-42

appointment of Yuri Maslyukov, former head of the Soviet-era Gosplan central planning
agency, as the top deputy for economic affairs and the reappointment of central bank
chief Viktor Gerashchenko, who is widely blamed for pursuing inflationary policies
during his previous tenure. Statements by Primakov and the other appointees have
indicated that one of the government's highest priorities will be eliminating massive
wage and other payments arrears, which many fear could lead to uncontrolled money
creation and result in hyperinflation.

The financial crisis has already had repercussions for the real economy. Real
GDP was down 8 percent in August relative to a year earlier, and industrial production
was down over 11 percent. The sharp depreciation of the ruble since mid-August has
also resulted in a surge in inflation to over 20 percent in August from a little under
6 percent in July (12-month change).IV-43
