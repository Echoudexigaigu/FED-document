Overview
The rise in real GDP in the third quarter evidently exceeded our expectations; but a
slowing of employment growth in the past couple of months suggests that activity may
be decelerating again in the current quarter. Meanwhile, indicators of wage and price
inflation have been mixed of late.
Real GDP for 1998:Q3
On October 30, the BEA issued its initial estimates of the national income accounts
for the third-quarter showing that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent.
Since then, new data, on net, point to a small upward revision. The largest change on
the plus side is a faster pace of inventory investment at merchant wholesalers; an
upward revision to business fixed investment is also likely, based on September
reports on construction put in place and manufacturers' shipments. We have
anticipated some partial offsets in yet-to-be released data, primarily lower exports and
higher imports in September than had been assumed by the BEA. On net, we
anticipate that the new data will boost the GDP growth rate to 3.6 percent.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose just 116,000 in October after having increased
157,000 in September. Despite an upward revision to the September figure, the two
months of data mark a noticeable step-down in the pace of hiring--from 235,000 per
month during the first eight months of the year. Aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers rebounded 0.6 percent in October; they had dropped
0.4 percent in September, when seasonal adjustment difficulties appeared to depress
the measured workweek. The unemployment rate was unchanged in October at its
third-quarter level (4.6 percent) but was about 1/4 percentage point above the low
reached last spring.
After having posted only a small decline in September (-10,000),
manufacturing jobs dropped more than 50,000 in October. On average, these declines
match the rate at which factory employment has been contracting since March. The
cumulative job loss now totals 200,000--about 1.1 percent of the factory workforce.
Much of the decline has been in the apparel, industrial machinery, and electrical
equipment industries, which are particularly sensitive to conditions in Asia.
Construction employment zigzagged over the past two months, showing
essentially no net change. The flattening out appears in large part to be the result of
cutbacks in heavy construction that have been offset by ongoing hiring by residential
builders and special trade contractors.
Hiring in services has also tapered off a bit recently. October's gain was
depressed by unusually large monthly declines in employment in lodging and in
amusement and recreation services. Jobs in business services bounced back in
October, but, with sluggish activity in the help supply industry, the average rise in
recent months has been well below the brisk pace earlier in the year. In October, the
level of employment in the help supply industry--which has been volatile from month
to month--was 40,000 below its peak in June. The weakness in the temporary help
supply industry may be a result, in part, of cutbacks in manufacturing. At the
beginning of 1997 (the last period of available data), about 30 percent of workers in
the temporary help supply industry worked at manufacturing establishments.
One notable exception to the generally slower payroll gains has been the
strong performance in the finance, insurance, and real estate sector. Jobs there rose
almost 40,000 over the two months ending in October, with especially sharp gains
among securities and commodity brokers and by mortgage bankers and brokers.
However, with the recent announcements of staff cutbacks in the financial industry,
this year's hiring surge may be coming to an end.

Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated by the BLS to
have risen at an annual rate of 2.3 percent last quarter, well above the 0.3 percent rate
in the second quarter. The third-quarter figure is a preliminary estimate, and the
upward revision to real GDP that we are projecting would mean an upward revision to
productivity growth--perhaps as much as 1/2 percentage point. Productivity in the
manufacturing sector, at an annual rate of 3.7 percent for the third quarter, also posted
a stronger gain than in the previous quarter. Over the four quarters ending in
1998:Q3, productivity in the nonfarm business sector (as currently published) rose 1.7
percent, and manufacturing productivity increased 3.1 percent.
Since June, the unemployment rate has been steady at just over 4-1/2 percent,
and the labor force participation rate has fluctuated around the October reading of 67
percent. To date, layoffs do not appear to have played a major role in the slowdown
in employment. The proportion of the unemployed who are job losers has been little
changed since midyear, and initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained
low.
Most other labor market indicators are consistent with weaker hiring. The
Conference Board's help wanted index declined sharply in September, and respondents
to its October survey of households reported that current job availability had turned
much less positive. Looking ahead, respondents to the Conference Board as well as
the Michigan SRC survey were gloomier last month about future labor marketII-5

conditions. In contrast, the number of firms in the National Federation of Independent
Business' survey reporting jobs difficult to fill bounced back in October.
Industrial Production
Industrial activity has decelerated sharply since the end of last year largely because of
the decline in net exports. The slowdown is evident in every major market grouping
with the exception of construction supplies, where production has been boosted by
rising residential building. In the third quarter, industrial production was flat as
declines in manufacturing and mining output were offset by another surge in utilities.
Industrial production probably posted a small decline in October.1 Total
industrial output was pulled down by a sharp drop in utilities output from its high
level and another fall in mining output. The decrease in the output of utilities can be
explained by a return to more normal temperatures throughout the country. The recent
downward trend in mining activity is the result of reduced oil and gas drilling in the
wake of weak crude oil prices. Meanwhile, manufacturing output is estimated to have
risen.
Within manufacturing, motor vehicle assemblies increased 1/4 million units in
October, to 13.0 million units, a level higher than that before the GM strike.

Automakers expect to keep assemblies at a high level through the fourth quarter.
They are anticipating strong sales, and GM needs to restock strike-depleted
inventories. Nonetheless, if their sales objectives are realized, inventories will likely
remain quite lean at the end of the fourth quarter.
The production of aircraft and parts is estimated to have increased further in
October after having reached a very high level in the third quarter. Boeing officials
claim that most of the production snags that have plagued the effort to ramp up
assemblies since the end of 1995 are behind them. The company has significantly
reduced overtime, parts shortages, design changes, and the number of jobs behind
schedule--all key measurements of production problems. However, for Boeing to meet
its 1998 delivery schedule of 550 aircraft, production lines will have to run smoothly
and without the usual late-December shutdown.2
The production of computers and semiconductors evidently increased
substantially again in October. Although semiconductor output decelerated earlier this
year, production has picked up in recent months. According to a growing consensus
among market analysts, the chip industry is about to pull out of its recent slump.
Nevertheless, the extent of its recovery is still a matter of debate: Forecasts for the
increase in nominal worldwide chip sales in 1999 range between 7 percent and 16
percent.3
Looking beyond October, most indicators point to continuing weakness in other
areas of manufacturing. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported
a sharp decline in its new orders index in October, to the lowest level since early
1996; the Dun and Bradstreet index also plunged in September. Anecdotal evidence in
the Beige Book and from the Board staffs own industry contacts suggest that the
weakness is widespread within manufacturing. The slowdown in the demand for
manufactured goods will likely provoke a reduction in manufacturers' capital spending
plans and, consequently, a slowing of capacity growth.
On the positive side, the Commerce Department reported that orders for
durable goods increased substantially in the third quarter after having decreased, on
average, in the first half of the year. The staffs estimate for real adjusted durable
goods orders advanced almost 5 percent in the third quarter. However, a good part of
2. Through the first three quarters of 1998, Boeing delivered 370 commercial airplanes; another 180
are scheduled this quarter. The company plans to deliver a record 620 commercial jets in 1999; its
previous record, set in 1991, was 605 deliveries.
3. According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, nominal worldwide chip sales are expected
to decline 10.9 percent this year.

Consumption and Personal Income
Real personal consumption expenditures increased almost 4 percent in the third
quarter, but this was down from the still more breathtaking pace over the first half of
the year. Household net worth posted a noticeable decline during the summer slump
in the stock market, but previous increases in wealth undoubtedly provided some
ongoing impetus to spending last quarter; with the subsequent snapback in share prices
recently, wealth effects are likely to provide a continuing lift to demand for a while
longer. Several measures of consumer confidence have dropped sharply in recent
months from record highs, although they remain at relatively positive levels.
Total real PCE rose 0.6 percent in September after having increased 0.3 percent
in August. Real spending on durable goods was strong in September, led by a 4.3
percent jump in motor vehicle outlays. In addition, real expenditures increased for
4. For instance, orders for gas turbines skyrocketed in the third quarter because of strong demand
from electric utilities. Many utilities, most notably in the Midwest, experienced severe strains on
capacity this summer and are now ordering equipment to avoid these problems in the future.11-11

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
furniture, household goods, and electronic equipment (excluding computers); spending
on these items may be receiving a boost from the high level of activity in the housing
market. Real outlays for computers edged down; however, press reports of strong
consumer demand for PCs suggest that this is most likely a temporary lull. Real
expenditures for nondurable goods posted a solid gain, in part because of strong
purchases of apparel.
Real expenditures for services increased 0.4 percent in September. Overall
spending for energy services rose as above-average temperatures boosted outlays for
electricity (some air conditioners had to keep running). The weather pattern in
October would suggest that spending for energy services likely declined. Heavy
activity in the stock market boosted real outlays for brokerage services $6 billion in
September, and a further increase in stock market volume in October likely lifted
brokerage services. A rise in spending for airline travel contributed to a gain in
transportation services in September, but spending on recreational services dropped,
largely because of a decline in motion picture admissions.
Partial indicators of spending, such as various chain store indexes, indicate that
spending on goods in the GAF category of retail sales (general merchandise, apparel,
furniture, and appliance stores) increased modestly in October; trade commentary
suggests that warm weather delayed purchases of fall merchandise. However, the
surge in sales of motor vehicles undoubtedly provided a strong boost to overall PCE.
Retailers appear to be anticipating solid increases in sales through the holiday
shopping season.
Real disposable personal income rose 2.6 percent at an annual rate in the third
quarter, and the personal saving rate fell to 0.1 percent. In September, the saving rate
dipped to -0.2 percent--the lowest reading in the history of the monthly series, which
goes back to 1959. Although a rare occurrence, a negative saving rate does not seem
at odds with historical patterns of household behavior once the enormous gains in
household net worth over the past three years are taken into consideration. Labor
income growth probably recorded another solid gain in October, judging by the
aggregate hours and wages of production workers reported for the month.
Consumer confidence continued to retreat in October, according to standard
surveys. In October, the Michigan SRC sentiment index was nearly 12 percent below
its most recent peak in February, while the Conference Board confidence index was
about 15 percent below its peak in June; nonetheless, both remain at relatively high
levels by pre-1997-98 standards. In the Conference Board survey, households'
assessments of both current and expected conditions have deteriorated in recent
months. In the Michigan survey, assessments of expected business conditions haveII-13

weakened noticeably; by contrast, respondents' views on current and expected personal
finances improved somewhat in October. The index of expected unemployment,
which is not included in the overall Michigan index, deteriorated sharply in October,
reaching its least favorable level since June 1996. However, this change in sentiment
for the labor market overall did not yet appear to alter individuals' assessments of the
possibility that someone in their household would experience a job loss: On average
in October, households assigned a 21 percent probability that their household might
suffer a job loss over the next five years; that figure remained within the narrow range
recorded since the SRC added the question to its survey in January.
Motor Vehicles
Adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, sales of new light vehicles surged in October
to an annual rate of about 16-1/2 million units, an increase of about 1 million units
from the already strong pace in September. The strength in sales partly reflects a
renewal of aggressive incentives by the Big Three. As a result, the gains in sales were
a bit more concentrated in the domestic makes.
The favorable pricing environment is helping to maintain quite upbeat
consumer perceptions of buying conditions for new vehicles. The Michigan SRC
index of car-buying conditions jumped in October to its highest reading of the year;
consumers' more-favorable views regarding motor vehicle prices more than offset
concerns about current and future economic conditions. The Conference Board index
of buying intentions rose in October, but the three-month moving average is down
from the exceptionally high levels posted this spring, when the "coupon" incentive
programs were in place.
The outlook for sales in the near term remains solid, bolstered primarily by the
continuing incentives and modest-to-nonexistent sticker price increases on 1999
models. However, reports from industry contacts that the biggest incentives have been
on 1998 models, for which supplies are now nearly exhausted, suggest that sales in
November may decline substantially from the exceptionally strong October reading.
Housing Markets
Activity in the single-family housing market showed signs of peaking this summer, but
the decline of mortgage rates this fall has produced an upturn in several indicators of
demand.11-17

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Starts of single-family homes retreated some in August and September.5 Still,
the highest quarterly reading in 19 years was the third quarter's 1.27 million unit
annual rate for starts. Similarly, new single-family home sales have receded from
their record-setting pace in June, but the third-quarter average was the third highest in
the past 20 years, exceeded only by the preceding two quarters of this year. Existing
home sales set a record in July and declined only slightly in August and September.6
According to the monthly NAHB survey, sales of new homes strengthened
further in October. Applications for mortgages to finance home purchases also
increased. With a sharp increase in the share of households mentioning that mortgage
rates are attractively low, the Michigan SRC index of homebuying conditions
rebounded to one of the highest levels on record.
Prices of new homes rose moderately in the third quarter. The nominal
constant-quality price of new homes was up just 2.8 percent from a year earlier. Price
increases for existing homes--as measured by the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae repeat-
sales price index and by the NAR's average and median sales prices--have been
running somewhat higher, in the range of 4 to 7 percent above a year earlier.
Multifamily housing starts jumped 12-1/2 percent in the third quarter.
However, current market conditions in this sector are difficult to read. Although
vacancy rates for multifamily rental units have been about unchanged in recent years,
the CPI for residential rent has risen in real terms.
Although underwriting standards have been tightened in recent months, industry
observers report that most apartment developers have not had significant problems in
financing multifamily projects. However, large-scale projects are said to be
encountering greater difficulty in obtaining funds because they rely more heavily on
the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, where flows have constricted
and interest rates have risen sharply. Nevertheless, funding is available from
traditional sources, such as pension funds and insurance companies, and Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac continue to purchase and securitize mutifamily mortgages.
5. The September decrease was more heavily concentrated in the South, where activity had been
relatively high earlier in the summer. Hurricane Georges played at most, a small part in this decline;
the hurricane did not make landfall until September 28, and few large cities were affected.
6. Data on new home sales are based either on the signing of a contract or on payment of a deposit,
but a substantial portion of existing home sales are not recorded until the sale is closed.11-19

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Business Fixed Investment
We now estimate that real business fixed investment, which had a blistering first half,
was about unchanged in the third quarter7 Spending was held down last quarter by a
strike-related falloff in sales of new motor vehicles to fleets, which we expect to be
largely reversed in the current quarter, and by a decline in aircraft deliveries to
domestic firms.8 Outlays for nonresidential construction continued to slip last quarter.
Producers' durable equipment. Equipment spending outside of transportation
appears to have increased somewhat more slowly in the third quarter than earlier in
the year, although we estimate that it expanded at an annual rate of 12-1/4 percent.
Recent developments in financial markets and a weak outlook for the manufacturing
sector may have damped future capital spending plans, but through September new
orders for capital equipment had not yet waned.
We now estimate that, following even more phenomenal increases of 101
percent in the first quarter and 60 percent in the second, real outlays on office and
computing equipment increased at an annual rate of 46 percent in the third quarter.
Real expenditures continue to be boosted by price declines that have run at an annual
rate of almost 30 percent in each quarter this year, a faster drop than last year's pace.
Various anecdotes suggest that some firms are dealing with the Year 2000 problem by
upgrading to the latest information technology, a trend we expect to see extended for
some months. The near-term outlook for spending on communications equipment also
continues to appear positive: After having declined during the early summer, orders
for this equipment rebounded in August and September, and a substantial backlog of
orders remained.
Business demand for heavy trucks continues to be extraordinarily robust. Sales
for heavy trucks in the third quarter averaged a record 542,000 units (annual rate).
Net new orders of heavy trucks are off only slightly from the high levels seen earlier
this year. Nonetheless, a record backlog suggests that spending on heavy trucks
should remain strong in the near term. Excluding high-tech and transportation
equipment, growth in equipment spending slowed from a 10 percent annual rate over
the first half of the year to a 3 percent rate in the third quarter.
Despite numerous indications that firms have trimmed spending plans, orders
received by U.S. equipment makers were still solid through September. New orders
7. Our current estimate of third-quarter real BFI growth is slightly higher than the 1 percentage
point decline (annual rate) shown in BEA's advance release. The upward revision is a result of
September data on construction put in place that were stronger than BEA had assumed when preparing
the advance estimate and upward-revised figures for shipments of computers in September.
8. The decline was more than offset by an increase in exports of aircraft.II-23

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
for capital equipment excluding high-tech and aircraft rose 7-1/2 percent in the third
quarter. Much of this increase reflects a surge in orders evidently from electric
utilities for gas turbines. In other categories new orders, on net, rose modestly, but
assuming that the weakness in exports persists, the pace is consistent with rising real
domestic demand, at least over the next few months.
Nonresidential construction. Nonresidential building activity continued to
decline in the third quarter. On the basis of data through September for construction
put in place, the staff estimates that investment in nonresidential structures fell at an
annual rate of 1-3/4 percent last quarter. Construction of office space was unchanged
at a high level, which reflects the continued decline in vacancy rates and the rapid
pace of price increases for office properties. However, other commercial construction,
which includes retail stores and warehouses, has fallen, as has institutional
construction. In addition, industrial building ebbed further, a performance consistent
with the relatively low rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing. In contrast,
building of lodging facilities surged last summer, although declining contracts and
trade reports of overbuilding suggest that strength in this sector is unlikely to persist
for long.
In late summer, the financial climate for nonresidential construction turned
chilly, according to industry observers. In part because of calls by regulators for
increased vigilance, banks and thrifts are giving loan requests more careful scrutiny.
Large declines in their stock prices have limited the ability of mortgage REITs to raise
capital with which to finance construction or to bid for commercial mortgages.
Moreover, the bankruptcy filing in October by Criimi Mae, a REIT that had
aggressively acquired the lower-rated tranches of commercial-mortgage-backed
security issues, has limited the flow of credit from the CMBS market. As a result,
large projects, which have relied more on financing supplied through the CMBS
market, now face greater difficulty in obtaining financing and higher interest rates.
However, real estate finance subsidiaries of firms such as GMAC and General Electric
Capital reportedly are purchasing higher-risk CMBS issues, helping to support issuance
of CMBS, but at higher rates and with less accommodative credit standards as
compared with mortgage REITs. Furthermore, insurance companies and pension funds
remain active suppliers of financing for commercial real estate.III-25

Business Inventories
The pace of business inventory accumulation picked up in the third quarter and (by
our estimate) added 1.4 percentage points to the increase in real GDP--1.1 percentage
points excluding the effect of a transfer of uranium stocks from federal to private
hands.9 This faster pace was largely the result of two factors: a much smaller decline
in motor vehicle stocks than during the second quarter and an accumulation of farm
products by wholesalers. Excluding these two components, we currently estimate that
real inventory accumulation was about flat at an elevated rate in the third quarter.
Manufacturers' stockbuilding slowed last summer. For the third quarter as a
whole, book-value inventories increased $8 billion (annual rate), down from an
average pace of $21 billion over the first half of the year. Excluding this year's
sizable increase in inventories of aircraft and parts, the slowing in the pace of
accumulation is even more pronounced, with non-aircraft inventories rising at a
$2 billion annual rate in the third quarter, down from a $7 billion pace in the second
quarter and a $19 billion rate in the first quarter.10 The deceleration in stock building
has roughly followed shipments; the inventory-shipments ratio was unchanged in the
third quarter at just a touch above last year's average. Ratios have risen, however, in
steel, chemicals, and paper, three industries that have been hit hard this year by import
competition.
Non-auto wholesale inventories accumulated rapidly last quarter, with book-
value stocks increasing at an annual rate of $24 billion. The inventory-sales ratio for
this category rose to its highest level since 1986. Almost half of the third-quarter
accumulation is the result of a buildup of farm products. Good weather conditions led
to an early harvest this year, and stocks rose significantly at wholesalers in September.
Wholesalers of machinery, chemicals, and metals and minerals also appear to have
experienced undesired buildups of stocks. Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles
appear to be at comfortable levels; the slow pace of accumulation in July and August
kept the inventory-sales ratio for this category flat and well within the narrow range
seen over the past year.
9. In July, the federal government sold the United States Enrichment Corporation to private
investors. The sale raised real business inventories $5.1 billion (annual rate) in the third quarter and real
PDE $0.5 billion. The sale was reflected in the third-quarter NIPAs but did not show up in the monthly
Census inventory data. The increases in NIPA inventories and PDE from this sale were offset by lower
federal spending.
10. According to industry sources, Boeing has an estimated thirty-four finished aircraft in storage
awaiting delivery. Most of these planes were ordered by Asian customers who have delayed delivery
because of financing problems.II-29

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Federal Sector
Real purchases of consumption and investment goods by the federal government fell at
an annual rate of more than 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter. The rise in real defense
purchases of 4 percent (annual rate) was boosted by a rebound in defense investment
from a below-trend second-quarter figure. Net nondefense purchases, which fell 12
percent (annual rate), were held down by the sale of the United States Enrichment
Corporation. Nominal proceeds of the sale totaled $3.1 billion: $1.5 billion of
financial assets and $1.6 billion ($6.4 billion at an annual rate) of machinery and
inventories.
The Monthly Treasury Statement for September reported a unified budget
surplus of $70 billion for fiscal 1998, the first surplus since 1969 and the largest as a
share of GDP since 1957. Receipts rose 9 percent in fiscal 1998, reaching 20.5
percent of GDP, the highest share in the postwar period; outlays increased 3 percent,
falling to 19.7 percent of GDP, the lowest since the early 1970s. After excluding
deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds and adjusting for payment timing
dates, outlays rose only 2 percent, with reductions in defense and net interest and with
a meager 1-1/2 percent rise in Medicare outlays. The sharp deceleration in Medicare
reflects, in small part, the program cuts enacted last year and a slowdown in claims
processing.
Receipts in September were only 3-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier, in
part because of a delay in excise tax payments allowed under last year's Balanced
Budget Act.11 These factors notwithstanding, receipts appear to be slowing,
particularly withheld personal taxes (income taxes and social insurance contributions)
and corporate income taxes. Corporate income taxes in September were 1-1/2 percent
lower than a year earlier, a drop perhaps reflecting the fall in corporate profits.
Bucking the overall slowing in receipts were nonwithheld personal taxes (income and
social insurance contributions), which rose a hefty 9-1/2 percent in September relative
to a year earlier.
Outlays surged in September, rising nearly 9 percent after accounting for
deposit insurance, spectrum auction proceeds, and shifts in payment timing. Outlays
were lifted by a one-time charge of $5 billion for spectrum auction payment subsidies
because the government expects to receive less in payments from earlier auctions than
had been booked earlier. A pickup in defense spending also pushed up September
11. In addition, the Monthly Treasury Statement data are not seasonally adjusted. Seasonal factors
reduced this September's withheld income and social insurance taxes relative to a year ago because
September had one fewer Monday than last year and Mondays tend to have higher collection rates than
other days. Thus, these receipts were low relative to the year-earlier figures.11-33

outlays. Despite difficulties in the farm sector, September's net Commodity Credit
Corporation payments were a bit lower than last year.
The fiscal 1999 budget, which was completed about three weeks after the start
of the fiscal year, contained $21 billion in new budget authority for emergencies. No
significant changes were made to entitlement programs or tax laws.12 The
Congressional Budget Office expects that the new emergency spending will boost
outlays, relative to the discretionary spending caps, $14 billion in fiscal 1999,
$5 billion in fiscal 2000, and $2 billion in fiscal 2001. Budget authority for defense
was raised $8 billion to provide funds for Bosnia, Y2K readiness, missile defense
research, and intelligence activities. Agriculture spending was raised $6 billion, with
about half directed to an increase for all farmers receiving Freedom to Farm transition
payments and about half targeted to those farmers particularly exposed to unfavorable
weather conditions this past year. About $7 billion was added to other nondefense
programs, including embassy security ($2-1/2 billion), Y2K ($2 billion), and disaster
relief ($1-1/2 billion).
State and Local Governments
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments rose at an annual
rate of 3-1/4 percent in the third quarter, the largest increase since the beginning of
1997. Most of the strength was in investment spending, which advanced at an annual
rate of almost 7 percent. Real consumption expenditures increased at a 2-1/2 percent
rate, about the same as in the preceding six quarters. In nominal terms, construction
spending in September rose considerably faster than the BEA had assumed for its
third-quarter estimate, but the August figure was revised down. On balance, the third-
quarter level of construction is expected to be revised up only a bit.
Survey data on the status of general fund budgets in fiscal year 1998, which
ended June 30 for most states, indicate that state finances continued to improve for the
sixth consecutive year. Once again, actual revenues surpassed the states' projections
made during their 1997 legislative sessions, and state ending balances swelled to
8.7 percent of expenditures, the highest ratio since 1980. States are currently
projecting that ending balances in 1999 as a share of expenditures will fall to 6.9
percent. As they have in recent years, states are using the excess funds largely to
build reserves and reduce taxes. Tax cuts enacted during spring 1998 sessions are
estimated to total $6.1 billion, or 1.4 percent of previous-year collections, a slightly
12. A minor tax bill was passed that included tax cuts worth $10 billion over ten years, with
offsetting tax increases.II-35

bigger reduction than in recent years. As in past years, the largest reduction, nearly
60 percent of the total, was in personal income taxes. In the November elections,
initiatives to alter taxes in some significant way were on the ballots of eleven states; in
seven, the vote lowered taxes or prevented them from rising.
Labor Costs
According to the Employment Cost Index, hourly compensation of private industry
workers increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent over the three
months ended in September, a pace well above the average change over the past year.
The third-quarter figure was boosted by a sizable increase in finance, insurance, and
real estate (FIRE), where the furious pace of activity likely raised commissions and
bonuses yet again.
Over the twelve months ending in September, hourly compensation increased
3.8 percent, up from 3.2 percent over the preceding twelve months; the steep rise in
compensation costs in FIRE (which has a weight of less than 10 percent) accounted
for more than half of the acceleration. Wages and salaries moved up 4.3 percent over
the preceding twelve months, while benefits were up 2.6 percent. Both wages and
salaries and benefits have accelerated by similar amounts over the past year. Among
the major components of benefits, health insurance costs and nonproduction bonuses
have accelerated the most. However, retirement pension costs decelerated slightly
over the past year as rising stock prices reduced the need for employers to contribute
to defined benefit plans, and costs for state unemployment insurance and workers'
compensation continued to decline sharply.
Among industries, compensation increases have been fairly stable in
construction and manufacturing over the past year, but compensation has accelerated
sharply for a number of service-producing industries, especially for their white collar
workers. The most notable increase is for workers in FIRE, where the rise in
compensation costs over the twelve months ending in September was 8 percent, up
from 3 percent over the year-earlier period.13 Wholesale trade also recorded a sizable
pickup in compensation costs, with the largest increases for sales workers. Also,
compensation costs have accelerated somewhat in other service-producing industries,
such as transportation and public utilities.
13. Compensation in FIRE tends to move with financial market activity. ECI wages and salaries for
FIRE include commissions associated with home sales, mortgage refinancing, and stock market
transactions, while ECI benefits include lump-sum bonuses associated with transactions in the stock
market and other financial markets.II-37

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector--reported in the
Productivity and Cost report--rose at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in the third quarter,
the same pace as in the second quarter. Over the four quarters ending in 1998:Q3,
compensation per hour was up 4.4 percent, nearly a percentage point faster than the
increase over the previous four-quarter period. With productivity growth over the past
year still averaging 1-3/4 percent, the pickup in hourly compensation was fully passed
through to unit labor costs. Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector increased
2.6 percent over the four quarters ending in 1998:Q3, compared with 1.7 percent over
the previous four-quarter period.
Information on labor costs this quarter are primarily limited to the BLS
monthly data on average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers. In
October, average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent; the twelve-month change in average
hourly earnings was 3.6 percent in October, down 1/2 percentage point from the
year-earlier period.
Prices
Inflation has remained subdued. The consumer price index was unchanged in
September as another drop in energy prices offset a 0.2 percent increase in the index
excluding food and energy. A sharp decline in energy prices kept the increase in the
overall CPI to only 1.5 percent over the past twelve months, while the twelve-month
change in the core CPI was 2.5 percent in September, up 1/4 percentage point from
the rate recorded over the year-earlier period.
After having fallen 1 percent in August, the CPI for energy fell 1.3 percent in
September, leaving the index 9-3/4 percent below its level twelve months ago. Prices
of gasoline and heating oil dropped considerably further in September. However,
survey evidence from October and early November suggests that, on a seasonally
adjusted basis, retail prices of gasoline have moved back up a bit.
The index for consumer food prices was unchanged in September and has
increased 2 percent over the past twelve months, about the same pace as in the
preceding year. Declines in September in the volatile index for fruits and vegetables
and in the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs were offset by price increases
elsewhere, especially for dairy, butter, and margarine. At earlier stages of processing,
the PPI for crude foodstuffs fell further in September, to 8-3/4 percent below its level
a year earlier.
The index for consumer commodities other than food and energy edged down
0.1 percent in September despite another jump in the retail prices of tobacco products.
Apparel prices fell, offsetting much of the large increase in August that was associatedII-43

with seasonal adjustment difficulties around the Labor Day weekend. Prices of
furniture and household equipment declined further in September, and the prices of
new motor vehicles edged down as well. Several months of incentive-related swings
have left motor vehicle prices little changed from the levels of six months earlier.
Over the past twelve months, core commodity prices have increased 0.8 percent, up
from a 0.4 percent pace in the year-earlier period.
Prices of non-energy services rose 0.3 percent for a second month in
September. The index has risen 3.1 percent over the past year, up slightly from the
pace recorded in the year-earlier period. Shelter costs rose 0.5 percent in September,
after a 0.4 percent rise in August; in both months, rates for lodging away from home
posted sizable increases. Prices of medical services rose only 0.2 percent in
September, but were up 3-1/2 percent over the past twelve months after having
increased only 2-3/4 percent in the year-earlier period. Among other services, prices
were unchanged on average in both August and September.
Most other broad price measures have continued to rise less rapidly than the
CPI and have decelerated somewhat more. The four-quarter change in the GDP chain
price index was 0.9 percent in the third quarter, half of that recorded in 1997:Q3 and
the lowest since 1961. Across components, the prices for most expenditure groups
have decelerated over the past year. The index for producers' durable equipment
dropped 4-3/4 percent over the past four quarters, a record decline, which almost
certainly was a result of price declines for imports, lower prices for components and
materials going into domestically assembled goods, rapid technological change, and
the effects of import competition on equipment produced in the United States. The
rate of change in PCE chain prices has also slowed considerably over the past year;
the four-quarter change was only 0.7 percent in the third quarter, compared with 1.9
percent in the year-earlier period. Weak food prices, falling energy prices, and a
moderation of services prices have accounted for a deceleration in prices over the past
year that has been quite a bit sharper for PCE than for the CPI. Apart from food and
energy, the gap between core CPI and core PCE inflation has widened over the past
year, largely because of the deceleration in prices of services included in PCE but
excluded from the CPI.14
Inflation expectations appear to have stabilized in recent quarters after having
declined through the first quarter of this year. According to the Michigan survey, the
median one-year inflation expectation was 2.5 percent in October, a pace in line with
14. A decline in the rate of change in the imputed price index for services provided without charge
by financial institutions accounted for more than one-third of the deceleration in PCE prices over the
past year.II-45

the average recorded in the first three quarters of this year and 1/4 percentage point
below expectations a year ago. Both the Michigan five-to-ten year median inflation
expectation and the Philadelphia Fed's survey of professional forecasters' ten-year
expectations have been little changed recently and are between 114 and 1/2 percentage
point lower than the pace recorded at the same time last year.
No signs of inflation are evident at earlier stages of processing. The PPI for
intermediate materials other than food and energy declined in September to a level
about 3/4 percent below a year earlier. The PPI for core crude materials dropped
again in September and was down more than 11 percent during the past twelve
months.15 Among crude materials, price declines have been fairly widespread during
the past twelve months; the drop in metals prices has been especially large because of
collapsing foreign demand and surging imports. Since the PPI reporting date of mid-
September, many industrial commodity prices have declined further. The Journal of
Commerce industrial price index is down about 5 percent since that time, while the
CRB measure of spot industrial commodity prices has declined about 3-1/2 percent.
Both the JOC and CRB measures include industrial materials, such as metals and
fibers, but the JOC measure also includes energy commodities and forest products that
are excluded from the CRB measure. Because prices for forest products, especially
for plywood, are substantially lower than in mid-September, the JOC measure has
declined more rapidly recently than the CRB measure. Over the past year, the other
CRB measure, the futures index, has dropped nearly 16 percent; however, only a small
share of this index reflects changes in industrial commodities prices, with over half of
its weight from food commodites.16
In the agricultural sector, the widespread price declines that dominated the
markets through the summer have given way to a somewhat firmer price picture in
recent weeks. Futures prices for grains and oilseeds have gained support from the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar, anticipation of the food aid package for Russia, and a
small net downward revision in the USDA's estimate of 1998 crop production. Cattle
prices have also moved higher since late September, and the markets have pushed
back still further the timing of an anticipated plunge in the price of milk from its
current elevated level. By contrast, spot prices of hogs have dropped in recent weeks
to the lowest levels since the early 1970s.
15. Raw materials make up a small proportion of the cost structure of finished core consumer goods.
Therefore, even for declines in raw materials prices of this magnitude, the effect on retail consumer
goods prices is generally quite small.
16. The coverage of industrial commodities in the CRB futures index is narrow--only copper and
cotton are included--and the weight is small.II-47

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Recent Developments in Agriculture
The small downward revision to the USDA production forecast since late summer has
not altered the fact that 1998 was another reasonably good year for crops overall. The
agency's November forecast, which was released on November 10, indicates that the
total harvest in 1998 will be almost as large as that in 1997. Production has been
boosted, especially, by high yields for the major grain and oilseed crops that account
for a big share of total crop output. With exports expected to remain sluggish in
coming quarters, the USDA is projecting that about 5 percent of this year's production
of the three main crops--corn, wheat, and soybeans--will end up in inventories, adding
to the substantial buildup in stocks of those crops that took place after the 1997
harvest.
Ironically, the large harvests of the past two years have coincided with
repeated, strong alerts about potential disasters that the Pacific weather cycle--either El
Niño or La Niña--might bring to U.S. agriculture. To be sure, some of the predicted
effects of that weather cycle did come to pass. The strong El Niño episode that
emerged in the spring of 1997 and persisted through this past spring brought to some
regions disruptive flooding that weather forecasters had predicted. Similarly, the
surprisingly abrupt shift toward La Nifia conditions in the Pacific this past summer
was accompanied by a marked change, broadly in line with forecasts, toward drier,
hotter weather in some regions, especially across the South, that hurt crops such as
cotton. But neither El Niño nor La Niña seems to have caused much trouble for
farmers in the big crop-producing states of the Midwest, and aggregate farm
production has held up well. Although some observers now are watching to see if La
Niña conditions this coming winter will be similar to those that have preceded poor
harvests in some previous years, traders in futures and options markets do not appear
to be assigning a higher-than-usual probability to the risk of major crop losses.II-51

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Market interest rates have swung widely during the intermeeting period, only in part
reflecting shifting perceptions of System policy. Markets remain fearful and relatively
illiquid, resulting in pronounced price responses to incoming news or rumors-of
which there were more than a few in recent weeks. Unfortunately, a number of
negative rumors were confirmed, notably those of large losses suffered by major
commercial banks, investment banks, and hedge funds.
The quarter-point policy easing at the September FOMC meeting was viewed
in some circles as disappointingly small in view of the troubles affecting the markets,
and credit spreads and liquidity premiums widened in its wake. However, the
unexpected October 15 intermeeting action lowering the funds rate another
1/4 percentage point and cutting the discount rate a like amount gave the markets the
sense that the System was taking a more aggressive approach and would act to prevent
an economic downturn or contain additional financial damage. Accordingly, right
after the easing, traders pushed the yield on three-month Treasury bills down to a low
of 3.56 percent, off 80 basis points from the level just before the September FOMC
meeting; the thirty-year bond yield slipped below 5 percent, down 20 basis points from
just before the last FOMC meeting.
In recent weeks, Treasury yields have more than rolled back these declines,
reflecting both some reversal of the earlier flight to quality and a trimming of the
extent of anticipated System policy easing. The sharpest rise was posted in the bill
sector, exaggerated by unexpectedly large supply. On balance over the intermeeting
period, Treasury yields were unchanged to up about 20 basis points. The equity
markets have powered ahead, however, and major equity indexes are up 7 to
9 percent, on net.
Still, financial market participants remain somewhat skittish. While equity
prices have nearly recovered their losses of the previous three months, one-month-
ahead volatility implied by call options, though much reduced, remains high. A
preference for liquidity is still clearly evident in the government markets. For
instance, the yield on the most recently issued thirty-year Treasury bond is currently
around 11 basis points below the next-most-recently issued security, an abnormally
wide gap. Moreover, bid-asked spreads have not returned to normal, and sources
report that market depth-gauged by the amount dealers are willing to transact at
quoted spreads-continues to be poor. Spreads of Fannie Mae Benchmark and

Domestic Financial Developments
Freddie Mac Reference note rates over comparable Treasuries remain above early-
August levels, though below their recent highs. Measures of volatility inferred from
bond options remain high, indicating uncertainty persists. Contributing to the more
volatile setting is less capital being deployed by dealers in making markets and
arbitrageurs in smoothing prices.
In the corporate bond sector, the mid-October policy easing reduced mounting
strains and, on net, spreads on most investment-grade and high-yield bonds have
narrowed from their recent peaks. Nonetheless, spreads for bonds and commercial
paper remain wide, amid investor caution and lingering uncertainty about the amount
of high-yield debt still in the hands of hedge funds. With markets unsettled, issuance
of corporate debt and equity securities remained low in October, though signs of a
recovery have emerged in these markets during the most recent couple of weeks.
Financing for commercial real estate remains tight, although some renewed interest by
investors for investment-grade commercial mortgage-backed securities has spurred new
issuance, enabling conduits to trim some of their outsized inventories of previously
originated loans.
The disruption of the capital markets has led to a surge in bank credit,
especially business loans, which may be a portent of year-end credit demands likely to
be placed on banks. Monetary aggregates also have risen sharply, reflecting both
banks' need to fund new assets and extremely heavy inflows to money market funds.
Total household debt growth was strong in the third quarter, reflecting brisk
mortgage debt expansion and a pickup in consumer debt growth. Nonetheless, with
employment still high and many households' net wealth bolstered by the rebound in
stock prices, consumers as a group remain in fine financial health.
In a turnaround from recent experience, the Treasury revised up its estimate of
net borrowing needs for the fourth quarter, in part owing to unexpectedly slow growth
of tax receipts. Meanwhile, the issuance of state and local debt obligations has been
boosted by offerings to raise new capital for public investment projects, while
refunding issuance has slowed further.
Business Finance
Conditions in bond markets were extremely difficult for many nonfinancial businesses
through mid-October, but there has been something of a turnaround since that time.
Investment-grade bond issuance picked up in late October and early November, though
investors have favored bonds with shorter maturities, mostly ten years or under.

bonds is relatively low, and many companies have been using bond proceeds to pay
off higher-coupon debt or commercial paper; outstandings of nonfinancial commercial
paper fell in October and early November, reversing part of the substantial rise in
August and September.
The commercial paper market has not been immune to investor selectively, and
quality spreads opened up in October. Notably, the spread of A2/P2 over AA thirty-
day paper surged to about 55 basis points at the end of October, more than double the
average annual premium of the past couple of years.' This jump occurred well before
the usual year-end bulge, and market sources report particular difficulties in placing
paper maturing after year-end; indeed, yields on the relatively limited amount of
commercial paper with a maturity extending beyond year-end suggest that firms pay
very healthy premiums--on average about 600 basis points on an annual basis--over
those four or five days at year-end.
Junk-bond issuance picked up in late October and early November, after having
been largely dormant since mid-August. Telecommunication firms that need to fund
large amounts of fixed investment accounted for the majority of issues. Market
reception for these issues has been surprisingly strong, even for those at the lower end
of the ratings scale. More generally, well-known below-investment-grade firms in
noncyclical industries appear able to issue bonds without much difficulty, but others
seem to continue to face investor resistance.
A number of businesses finding the public debt markets inhospitable turned to
pre-established lines of credit at banks. As a result, business loan growth was
exceptionally strong in October. Respondents to the most recent Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey confirm that demand for business loans at banks has been boosted by
substitution from the commercial paper and bond markets. They also suggest that
banks are responding with tighter standards and terms on loans to large and middle-
market businesses. Although banks also reported some tightening of standards for
small businesses, it was a small move; also the October survey of the National
Federation of Independent Business showed that smaller firms were having little
difficulty obtaining credit and that they did not expect any material shift in credit
availability over the next several months.
Gross public issuance of equity shares by nonfinancial firms remained quite
light in October, with the record $4.4 billion sale of Conoco-DuPont's oil and gas

ratings between A+ and BBB-. The AA bond credit rating is assigned to corporations judged to be
highly creditworthy.III-7

subsidiary-accounting for the bulk of the activity. Demand for new shares of high-
risk growth companies has shown only limited signs of recovery in early November.
While stock prices for small companies have surged since mid-October, the gains have
only partly reversed losses earlier this year, and volatility of prices remains high.
Further, with new registrations turning up only recently, IPO issuance is expected to
remain light through year-end.
Merger activity among nonfinancial firms continued at a strong pace, despite
large swings in the market capitalization of both targets and acquiring companies.
More than $30 billion in megamerger deals (mergers larger than $1 billion) have been
completed since late September, and smaller mergers continued at their strong first-
half pace. In addition, after virtually halting in September, announcements of mergers
surged in October, with the larger new deals pending among grocery,
telecommunications, and household-products firms.
There are some signs that the creditworthiness of U.S. businesses has
deteriorated, though nothing that would explain the marked widening of risk spreads of
late. On net, Moody's upgraded nonfinancial corporate debt through September but
followed with a sizable net downgrade in October. Similarly, the default rate on junk
bonds has moved up lately-boosted by $2 billion of defaults in the first three weeks
of October-but it remains low by historical standards. Finally, the rate of failure of
nonfinancial businesses has risen in recent months, although it also remains near the
low end of the range seen during the 1990s.
Looking ahead, Moody's Watchlist does not point to a significant further
deterioration in credit quality. For nonfinancial firms, the amount of debt awaiting
review for a potential upgrade almost equals the amount on review for a potential
downgrade. The outlook for the credit quality of financial firms, which have been
buffeted by turmoil in world financial markets, is not quite so solid: The list of
financial firms on the Watchlist suggests a sizable net downgrade in coming months.
Bankers' Trust and Republic New York together had $40 billion in debt placed on
watch for a downgrade; Lehman Brothers, which had $50 billion of its securities on
watch for a possible upgrade as recently as July, was removed from Moody's list of
potential upgrades, and was placed on watch by S&P for a downgrade. Reflecting
these concerns, an index of money center banks' subordinated debt spreads over ten-
year Treasuries, which rose sharply from 90 basis points in early August to 240 basis
points in early October, remains elevated at about 158 basis points.
About 90 percent of S&P 500 firms have now reported third-quarter earnings.
These reports indicate that earnings per share fell about 3 percent from a year earlier,III-9

the first such decline since late 1991. By sector, earnings for oil and gas companies
slid further in the third quarter, while earnings for technology companies were about
even with year-earlier levels. Growth of earnings for other nonfinancial companies,
which account for the bulk of the S&P 500, eased further in the third quarter,
continuing the slowing that started in late 1997. In the financial industry, sharp
declines in earnings occurred among money-center banks and investment banks, owing
to trading losses and declines in underwriting fees and other corporate-finance-related
income. Analysts evidently view the recent weakness as temporary, as they continue
to call for a substantial rebound in profits over the coming twelve months.
Equity prices have surged, on net, over the intermeeting period, reflecting relief
that third-quarter earnings were not so bad as had been feared, a bit more optimism
about foreign financial conditions, and growing confidence that the System would take
the actions needed to keep the economy chugging along. The expected S&P 500
forward-earnings yield, which rose when stock prices slipped in August and
September, dipped back down as equity prices rebounded in the second half of
October. Comparing this S&P earnings yield to an estimate of the real long-term
Treasury yield is a common gauge of equity valuations. The gap between these two
yields narrowed in October and early November, reversing much of the widening that
occurred during the third quarter and suggesting a return to richer pricing.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
The supply of finance for commercial real estate continues to be constrained. Equity
issuance by REITs has dropped sharply from its first-half pace. Originations of
commercial mortgages by Wall Street conduits have reportedly ground to a near halt
as the industry continues to work through a substantial backlog of previously
originated mortgages that have yet to be securitized. Since the mid-October easing,
spreads on the highest-tier investment-grade commercial mortgage-backed securities
have narrowed by about 45 to 50 basis points. However, spreads on lower-rated
issues have widened further by 50 to 75 basis points as the major investors in such
subordinate securities, particularly mortgage REITs, have pulled out of the market.
Well-capitalized market players, such as GMAC Mortgage and GE Capital, appear
likely to boost their purchases of subordinate CMBS at current valuation levels, but it
is unlikely that spreads will tighten to the levels that mortgage REITs accepted over
the past two years.
The decline in investment-grade yields since mid-October has enabled the
conduits to work down bloated inventories of previously originated loans by issuingIII-11

new investment-grade CMBS. Since mid-October, nearly $9 billion of CMBS have
been issued, including a record $4 billion deal, and a substantial amount is scheduled
to come to market in the remaining weeks of November.
Reports suggest that life insurance companies and pension funds, institutions
that typically hold commercial mortgages, have increased their lending activities in
response to the shutoff of public market funds. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
also increased the amount of funds available to the multifamily housing sector. While
credit appears to be available from these institutions, terms and pricing are reportedly
much stiffer than earlier in the year. The most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey
indicates that a number of banks have tightened standards on commercial real estate
loans, in part because of disruption in the CMBS market.
Household Sector Finance
The ratio of household net worth to income declined in the third quarter but has
recovered considerably more recently with the increase in stock prices in the second
half of October and early November. Household preferences for financial assets have
shifted in response to price movements, as indicated by flows into mutual funds.
According to preliminary weekly data, provided by the Investment Company Institute
on a confidential basis, net flows to equity and high-yield bond funds were negative in
the first half of October, while flows to less risky funds-such as investment-grade
bonds, government bonds, and money market funds--were generally maintained. The
inflows to equity funds and high-yield bond funds, however, resumed at a fairly strong
pace in late October and early November.
Preliminary data suggest household debt grew rapidly in the third quarter.
Mortgage borrowing increased at an estimated 10 percent annual rate, and consumer
credit increased 5-3/4 percent. Mortgage debt has been fueled by vigorous home
purchase and refinancing activity in response to mortgage rates that have been
attractive despite a wide spread over Treasury rates. However, reports suggest a
softness in the subprime, high loan-to-value, and jumbo mortgage markets.
Despite increased debt, household debt service performance remained good in
the third quarter. Moody's reported that the delinquency rate on credit card accounts
in securitized pools was lower in August relative to a year ago-its ninth straight
monthly decline. Auto delinquencies at finance companies were down slightly in
September from August and remain well below their recent peak in early 1997.
Nonetheless, spreads on asset-backed securities are stuck at very high levels,
particularly for securities backed by home equity loans. Only a few of the highest-III-13

quality credit card and auto loan issuers were able to place securities in October,
though issuance appears to be growing in November. But, to date, only one new
asset-backed home equity issue has been sold this quarter.
Respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Survey indicate these difficulties in the
capital markets have had little effect on terms for consumer loans at banks. However,
home equity lenders that rely exclusively on securitizations for funding are facing
tighter restrictions on their lines of credit from banks, and therefore may reduce
lending.
Federal Government Finance
In a turnaround from recent experience, the Treasury revised up its estimated net
market borrowing needs for the fourth quarter to $30 billion, from $15 billion as of
August 3. The increase reflects slower growth in tax receipts, as well as smaller net
issuance of State and Local Government Series securities (SLGS) resulting from the
drying up of advanced refundings by municipal issuers in light of the turmoil in
financial markets. The increased borrowing needs can be more than met by the
$3 billion boost to weekly bill auctions that began in mid-September.
The Treasury's midquarter refunding package closely paralleled that in August,
with $16 billion of five-year notes, $12 billion of ten-year notes, and $10 billion of
thirty-year bonds. Market reception for the auction was tepid, with some of the
lowest coverage ratios seen in years, as competing agency and high-grade corporate
issues commanded renewed interest from investors. The Treasury also announced that,
henceforth, all of its marketable securities will be sold on a uniform price basis. The
Treasury has read the experience of its sale of two- and five-year notes, which have
been sold on a uniform price basis since 1992, as indicating that this auction format
produces a broader distribution of awards, improves the efficiency of market
operations, and reduces the financing cost of the federal debt.
In early October, the Treasury raised $8 billion in a reopening of January's ten-
year TIPS bond. Over the intermeeting period, yields on TIPS, which are less liquid
than nominal Treasuries, remained remarkably close to those on nominal securities.
The spread of nominal Treasuries over the ten-year TIPS narrowed from 104 basis
points at the September FOMC meeting to 86 basis points before the October easing,
but has subsequently retraced this drop and stands at 99 basis points, roughly half
what it was in August before the markets were shaken by the Russian debacle.

Domestic Financial Developments
Efforts by some government-sponsored enterprises to tap global markets have
proceeded swiftly, with about $25 billion of global issues in the intermeeting period.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accounted for $14 billion of this issuance, as they
continue to position their benchmark and reference notes as close substitutes for the
dwindling supply of Treasury debt. These new securities seem particularly popular
with Asian investors, who according to market reports bought about half of some
recent issues; also, bond traders report that the agency notes are more advantageous
than Treasuries for some hedging purposes, because the yields on agency notes may be
more highly correlated with corporate debt yields than are Treasury rates. Despite
requests by government-bond dealers to include agency debt in its outright open-
market operations, the domestic desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has
not announced plans to do more than replace its maturing holdings of GSE-issued
securities.
Municipal Finance
Gross long-term municipal bond issuance strengthened in October, owing to heavier
financing of new capital, which more than offset a drop-off in refundings. Advance
refunding activity has been slowed by the negative arbitrage that occurred when yields
on Treasury bonds (bought by issuers to fund their escrow accounts) fell below those
on the refunded bonds. In the November elections, voters approved a record amount
of municipal bond issuance, the largest portion to go towards education.
Investor demand for municipal bonds has increased with the turmoil in other
financial markets, but remains moderate. Flows to tax-exempt mutual funds have been
strong since August; however, market sources indicate that direct demand by retail
investors has remained tempered, likely owing to the relative illiquidity of individual
bonds. The moderate overall demand and heavy new supply of municipal bonds
continues to put pressure on yields, possibly reinforced by the unwinding of municipal-
versus-Treasury trades by hedge funds, which reportedly were heavy buyers of
municipal bonds earlier in the year. The most recent thirty-year revenue bond-to-
Treasury yield ratio stands at 1.00, down only slightly from October's high.III-17

Domestic Financial Developments
Money and Bank Credit
Amid the turbulence in financial markets, bank credit grew in October at a robust
18-1/2 percent annual rate, after adjusting for mark-to-market accounting effects.2 The
strength primarily owed to the hefty growth in business and security loans and in
securities holdings. Growth of real estate loans strengthened, but to only a 4 percent
rate in October, apparently held down by substitution by households from home equity
loans and variable-rate first mortgages into fixed-rate mortgages, for which there is
greater competition from nonbank lenders. Despite heavy mortgage refinancing
activity, consumer loans grew at a brisk 6-3/4 annual rate last month, after adjustment
for securitization, down only slightly from September.
M2 increased at a robust 12 percent annual rate in October, off only a bit from
its torrid September pace of 14-3/4 percent. Growth over the past two months in part
was fueled by increased demand for safe, liquid assets, likely reflecting the reduced
attractiveness of equity and other risky securities. This source of growth was
augmented by a continued decline in the opportunity costs of M2 assets following the
policy easings in September and October. Growth of retail money market mutual
funds and of currency outstanding, both domestically and overseas, was also strong
over the most recent two months.
M3 growth was only slightly faster than that of M2 on average over September
and October, despite significant shifts within its non-M2 components. Expansion in
large time deposits softened over the two months, as bank funding requirements
largely were met by core deposit growth. By contrast, institutional money market
funds, whose yields fall more slowly than market rates, advanced at a 50 percent rate
over September and October.
2. The turbulence in financial markets has also led to more caution on the part of banks in the
interbank market. According to the November survey of loan officers, many banks have scrutinized
carefully their bank counterparties and have selectively shortened credit lines, required more collateral,
and reduced maturities of their exposures.III-19

November Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices
The November 1998 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices focused
primarily on changes over the past three months in the supply and demand for bank loans to
businesses and households.1 Additional questions concerned interbank lending and potential
risks arising from business customers' year-2000 difficulties.
The survey results suggest a broad tightening of business lending practices. Citing increased
concern over the economic outlook, a large share of the participants indicated that they had
firmed standards and terms on loans to large and middle-market businesses and on commercial
real estate loans. Unlike recent surveys, a few banks also reported tighter standards and terms
on loans to small businesses. Respondents indicated that demand for business and commercial
real estate loans had increased, boosted somewhat by customers that were having difficulty
raising funds in the securities markets.
The survey found little evidence of any changes in lending practices on loans to households.
A few banks said they were more willing to make consumer installment loans, while modest
percentages said they had tightened standards on credit cards and on other consumer loans.
Terms on these loans were reportedly unchanged.
The responses to the questions on interbank lending show many banks have reduced the
amount they are willing to lend to certain financial institutions and some banks are requiring
shorter maturities, more collateral, or higher premiums on interbank loans. Nearly all those
restricting their interbank lending applied the adjustments to selected individual banks, many
banks restricted terms to Japanese institutions generally, and a few did so for European
institutions generally.
The respondents reported making good headway in assessing risks arising from year-2000
problems of their customers. Most of the banks noted that the large majority of their
important business customers were satisfactorily approaching year-2000 preparedness.
Lending to Businesses
More than one-third, on net, of the domestic banks said that over the past three months they
had tightened standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market borrowers (up from one-
quarter in September), and two-thirds of the foreign respondents said they had tightened (up
from two-fifths). This is the largest share of the domestic respondents reporting tightened
standards on these loans since 1990. Similar fractions reported tightening terms on C&I loans
to large and middle-market customers, with a large number raising the spreads of loan rates
over the banks' cost of funds and the premiums charged on riskier loans. Of those that
tightened standards or terms on loans to large and middle-market firms, about two-fifths said
the tightening had applied predominantly to large firms, about 10 percent said predominantly
to middle-market firms, and the remainder said policies toward both groups of firms were
tightened about equally. The largest domestic respondents--those with more than $15 billion
1. This summary is based on fifty-four of the fifty-six domestic respondents and all of the twenty-
three branches and agencies in the panel.

Part 2: Recent Developments, November 12, 1998
in assets--more commonly reported tightening standards and terms for these loans than the
smaller respondents, perhaps in part because larger banks are more likely to compete with the
capital markets--where borrowing conditions have deteriorated in recent months--as a source of
funds. About 15 percent, on net, of the domestic respondents tightened standards and terms
on loans to small businesses; the respondents had reported no change in standards or terms, on
net, on these loans in September.
A less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook was the most commonly cited reason for
having tightened standards and terms on C&I loans. Many banks also pointed (in decreasing
order of frequency) to a worsening of industry-specific problems, a reduced tolerance for risk,
and less aggressive competition from other banks and nonbank lenders. Both the September
and November surveys generally asked about changes in lending practices since August, so for
banks that reported tightening on both surveys it cannot be concluded that the tightening
reported in November reflects additional changes in policies since September. However, a
special question on the November survey found that a large share of the respondents had
tightened their standards or terms for C&I loans since September.
These results are broadly consistent with anecdotal reports from participants in the syndicated
loan market. The reports indicate terms on syndicated loans are significantly tighter than those
available a few months ago. Originations of these loans reportedly had dried up because
borrowers were resistant to the higher cost of funds, but in recent weeks, as firms have
become more comfortable with higher fees and wider spreads, origination volume has picked
up somewhat.
In contrast to September, when many of the banks said demand for C&I loans had fallen,
responses to the November survey indicate an increase in demand for these loans. One
quarter, on net, of the domestic respondents experienced greater demand from large and
middle-market firms, and 10 percent, on net, experienced increased demand from smaller
firms. About 15 percent, on net, of the foreign banks reported stronger demand. The
respondents pointed to shifts from other sources of credit--a response not commonly cited in
the past--as the primary cause of the increased demand. Specifically, about three-quarters of
the largest domestic and the foreign respondents said substitution from the bond market, and
half said substitution from the commercial paper market, had boosted loan demand. Few of
the smaller domestic respondents reported experiencing such substitution.
Nearly half of the domestic and foreign respondents tightened standards on commercial real
estate loans over the past three months. About half of the respondents widened loan rate
spreads and smaller fractions tightened other terms, including loan-to-cost ratios, debt-service
coverage ratios, requirements for take-out financing, and maximum loan sizes. Most
commonly the respondents said they had tightened because of a worsening of the economic
outlook, but many also pointed to disruption in the commercial mortgage-backed securities
market and to increased concern about the reliability of take-out financing. More respondents
experienced decreased demand for these loans than experienced increased demand.
Nevertheless, many respondents said the decline in issuance of CMBS had led to increased
demand at their bank by borrowers encountering difficulty getting credit elsewhere.
Lending to Households
Less than 10 percent of the banks said their willingness to make consumer installment loans
increased over the past three months, about the same as in September; no banks said theirIII-A-2

Domestic Financial Developments, Appendix
willingness to make these loans decreased. Fifteen percent tightened standards on credit card
loans and ten percent tightened standards on other consumer loans. Few banks reported any
change in terms on consumer loans of either type. About ten percent of respondents, on net,
experienced weaker demand for consumer loans. Almost all of the banks said that disruption
in the market for asset-backed securities had not affected their balance sheets or lending
practices with respect to household lending.
Few banks indicated a change in standards for home mortgages. More than half reported
stronger demand for these loans, with many stating that demand for mortgages was
substantially stronger. Although the question specifically asked about demand for mortgages
to purchase homes, the responses perhaps reflect, in part, the recent high level of mortgage
refinancing activity.
Interbank Lending
Many reports in recent months have indicated that increasing concern about the financial
health of counterparties had led to changes in banks' interbank lending policies, the subject of
special questions on the November survey. The responses show that nearly two-thirds of the
domestic and half of the foreign respondents have taken steps to restrict their interbank lending
during the past three months. About half reduced the amount they are willing to lend to some
or all institutions, and about a third stopped lending entirely to some institutions. Significant
percentages also cut back maturities on term loans, stopped making term loans altogether,
required greater interest-rate premiums, and increased the amount or type of collateral required
when entering into repurchase agreements. Of those banks that made changes to their
interbank lending policies, most applied the restrictions to selected institutions they considered
less creditworthy. Many also adopted a more restrictive posture toward Japanese institutions
generally and a few toward European institutions generally. Only two applied them to
domestic money center banks generally.
Year 2000 Risks
Additional special questions asked respondents about the management of risks resulting from
the possible year-2000 problems of their customers. The results show significant progress in
the respondents' evaluation of these problems since the May survey, which included similar
questions. Half of both the domestic and the foreign respondents reported having evaluated
the year-2000 preparedness of more than 90 percent of the business customers that account for
a material proportion of their loans. None of the respondents have evaluated less than 25
percent. In May, less than half of domestic respondents and less than one-fourth of the foreign
respondents had evaluated even 25 percent of their customers. Virtually all of the respondents
found that less than 15 percent of their material business customers were not making
satisfactory progress toward achieving year-2000 preparedness. Likely for this reason, nearly
all the survey participants had downgraded less than 3 percent of their material business
customers for inadequate preparedness.III-A-3

The value of exports declined slightly in August, following a much sharper drop
in July. In August, decreases in deliveries of large jet aircraft (industry data suggest a
reversal in September) and exported machinery were partly offset by a sharp increase in
automotive exports to Canada and Mexico (reflecting the end of the strike against GM at
the end of July). Strike-affected decreases in the value of automotive products to Canada
and Mexico accounted for most of the drop in exports in July. Exports were 2 percent
lower in July-August combined, relative to the second quarter. About half of the decrease
was in automotive products, and much of the remaining decline was in industrial supplies
and service transactions (primarily receipts from foreigners for travel and passenger
fares). Exports of machinery (other than computers and semiconductors) edged down at a
slightly slower rate than in the first and second quarters. By area, most of the decline in
goods exports was to Canada, with very small decreases recorded to Western Europe and
developing countries in Asia.
The value of imports rose 2 1/4 percent in August, virtually all in imports of
vehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico (largely the effect of the end of the strike at
GM). For July-August, imports were percent lower than in the second quarter.

Part 2: Recent Developments, November 12, 1998
Most of the decline was in automotive products and oil. Imports of steel rose at a slightly
slower pace in July-August than in the second quarter.
Oil imports and prices. The quantity of imported oil edged up in August,
reflecting both weak domestic production and strong consumption and inventory demand.
The quantity of oil imports in July-August combined was about the same as for the
second quarter. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate lower imports in
September and October, reflecting unusually high stocks and delivery delays caused by
weather.
The price of imported oil dropped sharply in July (due to unexpectedly high levels
of oil stocks) and was about flat in August and September. For the third quarter as a
whole, the price of imported oil declined 25 percent (AR) relative to the second quarter.
The spot price for WTI fell, on balance, during October and early November, reflecting
stronger exports from Iraq and non-OPEC producers and forecasts for weaker global
demand. Oil prices rebounded briefly in late October due to civil disturbances in Nigeria
and Colombia. Currently, WTI is trading in the $13 to $14 range.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of non-oil imports decreased 0.2
percent in September. Declines were recorded in all major trade categories of imports,
except foods, which rebounded from a sharp drop in August. The greatest declines were
in prices of computers. Prices of semiconductors remained unchanged. For the third
quarter as a whole, prices of non-oil imports declined 4 1/2 percent (AR), with decreases
recorded in prices of all trade categories. The price of "core" imports (which exclude
computers and semiconductors) decreased 3 1/2 percent (AR), a somewhat greater rate of
decline than in the preceding quarter.
Prices of exports declined in September for the fourth month in a row. The
greatest decline was in agricultural export prices. Prices of capital goods excluding
computers and semiconductors have changed little since the beginning of the year. For
the third quarter, the price of goods exports declined 4 percent (AR). The price of "core"
exports (which excludes computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products) declined
2 1/2 percent (AR), a slightly greater rate of decline than in the second quarter largely
because of prices of industrial supplies.
Price data for October will be released on November 18.IV-4

U.S. International Financial Transactions
In September and the third quarter as a whole, private capital inflows through
banks and foreign purchases of U.S. securities more than offset large official outflows
(lines 1, 3 and 4 of the U.S. International Transactions table).
A fall in the holdings of Latin American countries accounted for about 40 percent
of the third quarter's $46 billion decline in foreign official assets held in the United States
(line 1). Brazil accounted for almost all of this region's decline; however, partial data
from the FRBNY indicate that Brazilian official holdings remained steady in October.
OPEC reserve holdings also fell substantially in the third quarter. On the positive side,
Korean holdings increased steadily in the quarter and continued to do so in October.
At $24 billion, private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities were moderate in
the third quarter, and were more than accounted for by net purchases of corporate and
other bonds (lines 4 and 4b); less that 20 percent of this latter total went to U.S. agency
bonds. For the quarter, net purchases of Treasury securities were essentially zero and
foreigners sold U.S. stocks on net -with heavy sales of the latter in September (lines 4a
and 4c).
The zero net for foreign purchases of Treasury securities masked wide movements
in the holdings of residents of individual countries, particularly in international financial
centers. Hedge fund activity accounted for a $15 billion drop in holdings in the
Netherlands Antilles and an almost $11 billion increase in Bermuda and the British West
Indies. Holdings in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong increased by a total of
$10 billion. As for the large corporate bond purchases shown in line 4b, almost
$21 billion of the total was accounted for by residents of the United Kingdom. Finally,
virtually all of the large private net sales of U.S. stocks in September were transacted by
hedge funds in the Caribbean (line 4c).
U.S. investors had moderate net sales of both foreign bonds and stocks in
September and the quarter (lines 5a and 5b). Sales of European and Japanese securities
were significant.
Banks in the United States reported large net inflows in both September and the
third quarter (line 3). These inflows facilitated the recorded expansion of domestic bank
credit. Preliminary end-of-month data indicate a continuation of significant banking
inflows in October.IV-6

Part 2: Recent Developments, November 12, 1998
Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period following the September FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange
value of the dollar declined 1 percent on a weighted average basis against other major
currencies, led by a depreciation of 9 percent, on balance, against the yen. The dollar's
dramatic decline against the yen, which occurred almost entirely in a 30-hour period
bridging October 7 and 8, appeared to be related to decisions by hedge funds and other
investors to reduce leverage and exchange rate exposure inherent in so-called yen carry-
trade positions.1 While it is not entirely clear what prompted the rush for the door on
those days, it seems likely that for many investors the sustained financial turmoil over the
past year, which reached a peak in August and September, reduced capital cushions and
tolerance for risk, prompting an unwinding of highly leveraged positions. In the
aftermath of the dollar's sharp move down against the yen, trading conditions in foreign
exchange markets became thin and illiquid, with bid/asked spreads even in major
currency pairs unusually wide and foreign exchange dealers unwilling to conduct
transactions in customary size. Liquidity conditions in foreign exchange markets
subsequently improved, particularly for transactions involving the dollar and European
currencies, but some nervousness remains.
The sharp re-alignment of the dollar-yen exchange rate prompted some significant
adjustments in other currency rates in the Asian-Pacific region, with currency values
moving to intermediate positions, stronger against the dollar but weaker against the yen.
As a consequence, the dollar depreciated between 2 percent and 7 percent against the
currencies of Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. Local short-term
interest rates declined as these currencies moved higher against the dollar, perhaps
reflecting some easing of monetary policies in reaction to the move down of the dollar.
The dollar depreciated 26 percent against the Indonesian rupiah during the period.
This large decline can be explained only in part by the movement in the dollar-yen
exchange rate. Other factors include the relatively restrictive monetary environment of
Indonesia in which short-term interest rates stayed at levels of nearly 60 percent or higher
1. These positions, which were apparently widespread and are generated by funding
investments in non-yen assets with low-interest yen loans, were seen as profitable when
the risk of yen appreciation seemed small.IV-8

during the period and perceived progress in the reform and restructuring program
Indonesia agreed to with the IMF.
In contrast to these fluctuations, the dollar's movements against other currencies
were more moderate. The dollar appreciated 1/2 percent against the mark. Initially, the
easier stance of U.S. monetary policy relative to the unchanged stance of the Bundesbank
weighed on the dollar, as did perceptions that U.S. economic activity would be more
vulnerable to financial turbulence in Latin America. But, market perceptions of an ease
have decreased somewhat due to a robust recovery in U.S. markets, and expectations of
forthcoming aid to Brazil have alleviated some of the worries of U.S. banks' exposure to
financial turmoil. Other euro-area central banks lowered official interest rates during the
period, bringing their short-term market interest rates closer to the corresponding German
rates, but these moves were seen as part of the convergence process ahead of the launch
of the monetary union in January and were largely expected. The Central Bank of Ireland
reduced its key policy rate twice for a total of 250 basis points, the Bank of Italy reduced
its Lombard and discount rates 100 basis points, and the central banks of Spain and
Portugal each reduced their key policy rates 50 basis points.
The dollar rose 2 percent against sterling, as the Bank of England lowered its
official RP rate 75 basis points in two steps during the period, somewhat more than had
been expected, in response to indications of weakening economic activity in the United
Kingdom. The U.S. dollar rose 2 percent against the Canadian dollar, as slower
economic activity weighed on the Canadian dollar. Moving in tandem with the policy
actions by the Federal Reserve during the period, the Bank of Canada reduced its bank
rate twice, in steps of 25 basis points each.
The widespread declines in short-term interest rates around the world were
generally accompanied by indications of reductions in financial stress, with the flight to
quality that prompted a shift out of equities and into liquid government securities
appearing to reverse. Ten-year yields on U.S. and German government securities rose
about 20 basis points during the period. Yields on comparable government securities in
other euro-area countries were also higher, but spreads between those yields and the
German bond yield declined. Industrial country equity prices rose between 4 and 10
percent on balance during the intermeeting period.IV-10

Internationally coordinated efforts to contain a possible financial crisis in Brazil
also appear to have reassured investors in emerging market assets. Emerging market
equity prices also rose substantially, many turning in double-digit increases. In addition,
Asian and Latin American dollar-denominated bond yield spreads declined on balance

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Incoming data suggest that the pace of economic activity in the major foreign
industrial countries has slowed in the second half of the year. In Japan, third quarter real
GDP is likely to register its fourth consecutive quarterly decline, with virtually all
indicators of private demand showing further deterioration from already low second-
quarter levels. Available data for the European economies are mixed but on balance
suggest that output growth is slowing, especially in Germany. Although official data for
the United Kingdom show that real GDP continued to expand at a moderate pace in the
third quarter, survey data point to considerable weakness in the near term, and indicators
suggest that the Canadian economy is slowing more than previously expected.
Low or falling producer and import prices are helping to keep consumer price
inflation subdued. On a twelve-month basis, consumer price inflation is close to zero in
Japan, below one percent in Germany, France, and Canada, and below two percent in
Italy. In the United Kingdom, retail price inflation is somewhat higher but has declined
in the past two months to meet the 2 1/2 percent target.
Softer domestic demand and a weaker outlook for the global economy have led to
policy rate reductions of 75 basis points in the United Kingdom and 50 basis points in
Canada. In line with the process of EMU convergence, official rates have also been
reduced in several continental European countries, including a 100-basis point reduction
in Italy.
Individual country notes. In Japan, evidence suggests that the economy
registered its fourth consecutive quarterly decline during the third quarter.
Unemployment remained at an all-time high of 4.3 percent in September, and the
offers-to-applicants ratio declined to a record low of 0.49. Industrial production during
the third quarter was at its lowest level in over four years, down 0.3 percent from the
already weak second-quarter average. Household expenditure, housing starts, andIV-12

International Developments
machinery orders also registered sizable declines. In October, new car registrations fell to
their lowest level since spring 1987. In a piece of good news, public works contracts
increased almost 30 percent in September, relative to July and August levels, suggesting
that fiscal stimulus measures are beginning to come on line.
Japan's current account surplus during the first eight months of the year was
$116 billion at an annual rate, up from $94.2 billion during all of 1997. Merchandise
exports (valued in dollars) are down 8.2 percent from the 1997 average, but imports have
slumped 17.2 percent.

The Bank of Japan's September "Tankan" survey showed further deterioration in

June to -51. The diffusion index for small manufacturers dropped from -49 to -57, the lowest
score since these firms first were included in the survey in 1967. The outlook for non-
manufacturing firms also worsened, with the business sentiment index for large firms falling
from -28 to -36 and that for small firms falling from -42 to -44 (also a record low). All

classes of firms marked down their forecasts for profit growth during FY 1998. Major
manufacturers cut their projections from -1.4 percent in June to -11.6 percent in September,
while small manufacturers slashed their projections from -3.5 percent to -33.2 percent.
In mid-October, the Japanese Diet approved banking reform legislation, allocating
¥35 trillion (about $290 billion equivalent) for protecting depositors, resolving insolvent
financial institutions (either through temporary nationalization or a bridge bank facility), and
funding the Resolution and Collection Corporation or RCC (an RTC-like entity authorized to
purchase non-performing loans from both failed and open banks). The legislation provides
¥25 trillion (about $210 billion) for recapitalizing weak institutions. The Diet also created
the Financial Revitalization Committee, headed by a Cabinet-level Minister, which will be
jointly responsible with the Ministry of Finance for overseeing banking sector restructuring.
While this legislation likely provides adequate funding to resolve the banking sector's
difficulties, it remains to be seen whether the authorities will require banks to provision
against bad loans, remove bad debts from their balance sheets, and improve the efficiency of
their operations.
On October 23, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan filed an application for
temporary nationalization. The Financial Supervision Agency announced that, once marked
to market, the bank's liabilities exceeded its assets by ¥340 billion (about $2.8 billion). The
Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) will acquire all LTCB's outstanding shares (with
previous shareholders being effectively wiped out) and provide other support, including the
extension of temporary liquidity to LTCB and the provision of funds to cover losses. The
bank's obligations, including deposits, debentures, interbank borrowings and derivative
transactions will be protected, and the RCC will purchase LTCB's problem loans. Funds to

Third-quarter indicators for the euro area are mixed. Industrial production declined
in August, but is up 1.1 percent from the second quarter for July and August on average.
Business confidence through September has weakened while consumer confidence remains
subdued. The unemployment rate in July and August moved down a bit from the second
quarter average. For the third quarter as a whole, harmonized consumer price inflation
remained comfortably below the 2 percent upper bound of the European Central Bank's
announced inflation target.IV-14

Data released over the past several months point to a more subdued pace of GDP
growth in Germany in the second half of 1998, even allowing for a bounceback in the third
quarter from the second quarter's 0.4 percent growth rate (SAAR). The volume of orders for
manufactured products received by German industry fell in August and again in September.
Orders placed by foreigners (not shown in table) have been sliding down over the course of
the year and are now 3 1/2 percent below their level a year earlier, while domestic orders (not
shown) have begun to slow more recently as well. Manufacturing capacity utilization has
retreated slightly over the past half year although the utilization rate remains at a high level.
Orders to plant and machinery producers (not shown) plummeted during the past several
months, with September orders showing a decline of 24 percent compared to one year earlier.
Although third-quarter industrial production is up from the second quarter average,
production actually fell in both August and September. The business climate appears to have
darkened considerably, with a September survey of business confidence (the IFO survey)
showing that for the first time since January 1997 the number of firms citing a deterioration
in business conditions exceeded the number citing an improvement.

Price data confirm the absence of inflationary pressure. In October, consumer prices
rose 0.7 percent on a year-over-year basis. Compared to September one year earlier,
producer prices, wholesale prices, and import prices (none shown) were down 1.0, 4.2, and 5
percent, respectively.
In France, third-quarter data are mixed, but suggest some slowdown in economic
growth; the October business outlook shows decreased confidence and has fallen each month
since June. Industrial production fell 0.3 percent in July-August. However, consumption of
manufactured products rose 2.0 percent in September and 2.6 percent in the third quarter.
Consumer prices in October rose 0.5 percent on a twelve-month basis, down slightly
from the 0.7 percent rate recorded in August. Inflation remains near 40-year lows.
Inflationary pressures are likely to remain contained owing to deregulation of prices of some
public services (i.e., state telecoms) and ongoing price competition among manufacturers.IV-16

In Italy, official estimates of third-quarter economic activity are likely to show an
increase, in large part because there were more working days than in the second quarter.
However, available indicators still show weakness. Although industrial production recovered
in September, it was down 0.3 percent for the quarter, the third consecutive quarterly decline.
Business sentiment weakened notably in September and remains well below levels registered
earlier this year. For the quarter as a whole, the unemployment rate edged up.
Consumer prices rose 1.7 percent on a year-over-year basis in October. The inflation
data continue to support the view that lower oil and commodity import prices and ongoing
sluggishness in the domestic economy will keep price pressures subdued in the near term.
In a move widely anticipated by market participants, on October 26 the Bank of Italy
lowered its key policy rates 100 basis points each. The Bank's discount and Lombard rates
now stand at 4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Since July 1996, both rates have been
lowered seven consecutive times for a cumulative 500 basis points.
In September, the Prodi government presented its 1999 budget to Parliament which,
on October 9, led to a failed confidence vote and the ousting of the prime minister. On
October 21, Massimo D'Alema, an ex-communist and the leader of the Democrats of the Left
Party, was sworn in as the new Italian Prime Minister. Seven ministers from the out-going

and revenue targets specified in last year's budget would remain in effect on a monthly

Economic activity in the United Kingdom continued to expand at a moderate pace in
the third quarter, but survey indicators point to considerable weakness in the near term.
According to the preliminary estimate, GDP in the third quarter grew a somewhat faster than
expected 2 percent (SAAR), at about the same rate of growth as in the second quarter. Third
quarter GDP growth is likely to be revised down in the next release, as industrial production
data for September, released after the GDP estimate, declined more than expected.
Manufacturing surveys for October showed further sharp drops in business confidence,
output expectations, and orders. Consumer confidence has also weakened noticeably in
recent months, and the Purchasing Managers' service sector survey indicated that activity
registered only a modest increase in October.
The twelve-month rate of British retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
payments) was 2.5 percent in September, meeting the inflation target for the second
consecutive month. The official claims-based unemployment rate remained 4.6 percent in
October, the lowest rate since 1980.IV-18

At its November meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of
England reduced the official repo rate 50 basis points to 6.75 percent, following a 25 basis
point reduction in October. The MPC noted that news about the international environment
and prospects for domestic activity had led to a downward revision in the forecast for growth
next year. In the November Inflation Report, the MPC stated that the outlook for inflation
will depend on developments in the labor market, where conditions remain tight although
there are indications that it is no longer continuing to tighten. The MPC expects inflation to
pick up slightly next year, reflecting wage developments associated with the introduction of
the minimum wage, but to return to the inflation target rate through the end of 2000. The
MPC also stated that while there had been some increase in volatility and reduction in
liquidity in financial markets, there was no evidence of a "credit crunch," noting that in the
United Kingdom the banking system is the main external source of business finance and
"there has so far been no sharp deterioration of credit conditions."
In Canada, recent data indicate that the economy has lost momentum. Although
GDP at factor cost picked up in August, it declined slightly from the second quarter's level
for July and August on average. Some of this summer's weakness in GDP reflected

Part 2: Recent Developments, November 12, 1998
production disruptions of the GM strike. However, lackluster gains in retail sales as well as
declines in consumer and business confidence in the third quarter suggest that the economy is
slowing more than previously expected.
Although virtually all other indicators suggest that the Canadian economy has slowed
considerably, recent employment growth has been stronger than expected. Employment in
October was up 2.9 percent over October one year ago and has posted four straight months of
solid gains. Other bright spots in Canada are trade and inflation. After narrowing in the
second quarter, the trade surplus widened sharply in July and August. Lingering effects of
the GM strike have complicated the interpretation of monthly trade data, but some of the
recent improvement likely reflects the year-long decline in the Canadian dollar combined
with weak domestic demand. Consumer price inflation on a year-over-year basis was less
than 1 percent in the third quarter mainly due to falling energy prices.
After raising its Bank Rate 100 basis points in August, the Bank of Canada seized the
opportunity to reverse some of this rate hike by matching the two 25 basis point cuts in the
federal funds rate. The Bank Rate is currently 5.5 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Asia, there is some evidence that trends in economic activity may have improved
somewhat during the third quarter; growth reversed its slowing trend in China, and in Korea
and the ASEAN economies, data appear to suggest some moderation in the pace of output
declines. Asian trade balances generally remained in sizeable surplus, primarily reflecting
declines in the value of imports. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed in Hong Kong,
although the narrowing appears to have been offset somewhat by a declining services surplus.
Inflation in Asia generally remained steady, or, in some cases, eased slightly in the third
quarter.
In Latin America, Brazil is nearing an agreement with the IMF amid strong pressure
on the currency. Economic activity appears to have weakened in Argentina and Venezuela.
Latin American trade balances remain in deficit; these deficits have tended to widen in recent
months. Inflation was little changed on balance.
In Russia, output has fallen sharply in recent months, and inflation has surged.
Individual country notes. In Korea, recent data appear to suggest some bottoming
out of activity, although special factors tended to distort measures of activity upwards,
thereby complicating interpretation. Industrial production in September was slightly above
its year-earlier level, after posting a nearly 12 percent year-over-year drop in August.
Similarly, retail sales showed a 12-month decline of 12 percent in September, substantially
less than the 17 percent year-over-year drop the previous month. However, the level of
measured activity in September was artificially raised because of the timing of the three-day
Korean Thanksgiving holiday, which fell in October this year but September last year. In
addition, production in September was boosted to compensate for losses from labor disputes
and torrential rains in August. The unemployment rate continued to rise in September,
moving up to 8.4 percent (SA) from 8.1 percent the previous month.
Korea's current account showed a surplus of $42 billion (AR) in the first three
quarters, compared with a deficit of $16 billion in the year-earlier period. In the first three
quarters, the dollar value of exports fell 6 percent from their year-earlier level; the dollar
value of imports fell 37 percent.
With the inflation rate remaining moderate and the won strengthening, the authorities
have continued to reduce interest rates; the overnight rate is now down to
7 percent.IV-24

In the ASEAN region, weakness in domestic demand (in part reflecting tight credit
conditions) and foreign demand (especially from Japan) continued to dampen economic
activity, although the pace of declines may have moderated somewhat. Preliminary estimates

in previous quarters. Industrial production continued to fall in Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand through August and September, although at a slower rate than in previous months.
Inflation appears to have stabilized across the region, in part reflecting weak domestic
demand and recent currency strength. Singapore now shows signs of deflation. In Indonesia,
12-month inflation declined somewhat in October as consumer prices were virtually
unchanged from their September level, reflecting the rupiah's sharp appreciation.

As a possible sign of returning confidence in the region, ASEAN stock markets have
rallied and currencies across the region have strengthened significantly since mid-September.IV-26

International Developments
The Indonesian rupiah posted especially strong gains, in part reflecting continued high
domestic interest rates, perceived progress on economic reforms, and the strengthening of the
yen.
In Hong Kong, the unemployment rate, which nearly doubled from the fourth quarter
of 1997 to the second quarter of 1998, appeared to stabilize somewhat at 5 percent in the
third quarter. Inflation in September fell to Hong Kong's lowest rate since 1976. Reflecting
substantial declines in imports, Hong Kong's merchandise trade deficit has narrowed sharply
during 1998. However, data on the components of GDP for the first half of the year suggest
that the improvement in merchandise trade has been offset somewhat by a deterioration in net
services exports. Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves were $88 billion at the end of
September, down from a recent peak of $97 billion at the end of July. The decline largely
reflected the August stock market intervention by the Hong Kong authorities, which
amounted to $15 billion. (The decline in foreign reserves was smaller than the announced
share purchases, which may reflect some use of domestic as well as foreign-currency assets
for intervention, as well as investment earnings and portfolio revaluations). In October,
authorities also announced that there had been no additional share purchases after August.

In China, official statistics indicate that GDP growth in the third quarter reversed its
recent declines, even as consumer prices continued to fall. The resurgence of growth appears
to reflect substantial increases in investment in infrastructure and by state enterprises,
including strong inventory investment. The increase in investment by state enterprises
appears to have been financed by substantially faster third-quarter lending by the four major
banks. Hence, the increase in growth appears to be at the expense of previously announced
enterprise and bank reform.IV-27

Net exports remained strong, reflecting weak import growth. In the first ten months,
the dollar value of exports rose about 1 percent from the same period in 1997, while imports
fell about 1 percent. In the four months since June, however, however, the dollar value of
exports fell nearly 6 percent from the year-earlier period, while imports fell more than 4
percent. Total reserves less gold, which increased $33 billion in 1997 before stabilizing in

In October, central government authorities closed the Guangdong International Trust
and Investment Company (GITIC) because of the institution's inability to repay maturing
debt obligations. GITIC was owned by Guangdong Province and was one of China's largest
non-bank financial institutions. Although the four state banks dominate China's financial
landscape, accounting for almost 80 percent of financial assets, non-banks grew relatively
rapidly in the 1990s and were largely unregulated. The closure of GITIC indicates that
authorities may be serious about trying to crack down on financial "irregularities." However,
most foreign creditors had assumed that loans to China's ITICs were implicitly guaranteed by
the government, a presumption that the central government now disclaims. The government
has so far made few announcements about what loans will be repaid and in what proportion.
Hence, foreign banks have reportedly become much less willing to lend to Chinese entities.
In Taiwan, industrial production rose strongly in August and September from year-
earlier levels, while inflation picked up in October. Unemployment in September was
virtually unchanged from August at 3.0 percent. Taiwan's trade balance improved sharply in
the third quarter, primarily reflecting weak imports. In the third quarter, the dollar value of
exports fell nearly 10 percent from its year-earlier level, but the value of imports fell 16IV-28

percent. The trade balance declined in October, largely reflecting a temporary surge in
aircraft deliveries. Total official reserves less gold rose $2 billion in October to $87 billion.

In Mexico, recent economic reports have been mixed. Industrial production figures
for August showed some rebound in output that month. However, other economic reports
offer partial evidence that output deceleration is taking place and that tight polices are
restraining domestic demand. For example, the unemployment rate rose in September to
3.3 percent, up from 3.0 percent in August. The September trade deficit was again sizeable,
reflecting continued low oil prices. Consumer price inflation edged up slightly in
September.
The government is due to send its 1999 budget plan to Congress on November 13. It
had wanted a solution to the problem of bailing out Mexico's weakened banking system to be
resolved beforehand to help determine appropriate spending levels. It now appears that no
agreement on the bailout fund, Fobaproa, is likely before the 1999 budget is presented to
Congress, as Mexico's main opposition party continues to disagree with the government's
proposal to formally incorporate Fobaproa's liabilities as part of the national debt. The
opposition party wants to replace Fobaproa with a new Bank Deposit Insurance Institute to
manage its liabilities and have the banks take on a greater share of the cost. Currently it is
not clear how this debate will be resolved. It is anticipated that the government will refrain
from introducing any new initiatives into the budget in order to have some chance of passing
it by the legal deadline of December 15. The government is expected to hold the 1999 deficit
no higher that 1.25 percent of GDP, unchanged from 1998.IV-29

Events in international financial markets and uncertainty in Brazil continue to
influence financial markets in Mexico. In recent weeks, financial markets in Mexico have
begun to stabilize. Between the end of September and November 11, the peso strengthened
about 1 percent; the stock market rose over 12 percent; and spreads on Mexican Brady bonds,
adjusted for collateral, declined over 100 basis points. The 28-day Cetes rate also eased to
32.0 percent, down from a recent peak of 47.7 percent in mid-September.
In Brazil, real GDP rose by 5.9 percent in the second quarter, despite interest rates
that were high in nominal and real terms. Rates rose even higher in early September, when
they were raised from 20 to 40 percent to defend the real. In September, industrial output fell
nearly 25 percent (SAAR), reflecting in large part a plunge in auto production.
Unemployment fell slightly in September, but remains very high. In recent months, price
indices have fallen slightly, mainly reflecting declines in food prices. The decline in
economic activity in September led to a narrowing of the September trade deficit relative to
the year-earlier level. However, the current account deficit widened considerably that month,
largely reflecting a sharp increase in profit remittances and dividend payments abroad.
The currency remained under strong downward pressure during much of the
intermeeting period. Pressures on the currency have been fueled by the perception that fiscalIV-30

International Developments
trends remain incompatible with the government's commitment to limit the depreciation of
the currency against the dollar to 7 1/2 percent per year. Brazil's overall fiscal deficit reached
7 1/2 percent of GDP in July, and a recent increase in interest rates has exacerbated fiscal
pressures because two-thirds of the government's securities debt is indexed to the overnight
interest rate. International reserves fell roughly $2 billion during the intermeeting period to
about $44 billion on November 11, despite having been boosted by inflows associated with
foreign acquisitions of Brazilian banks.
President Cardoso was re-elected on October 4, but new policy measures to address
investor concerns were delayed until after congressional and gubernatorial run-off elections
on October 25. On October 28, Finance Minister Pedro Malan unveiled a package of
measures aimed at tackling Brazil's serious fiscal problems. Malan also declared, as he has
previously, that the current exchange rate regime would not be altered. The new package
aims to improve the overall public sector budget balance by about 4 percent of GDP in 1999
relative to the government's baseline forecast, which projects a rising deficit because of the
deteriorating deficit of the social security systems for private and public sector workers. The
package of fiscal measures entails some tax increases that are intended to be temporary, but
takes significant steps towards addressing the two most important sources of fiscal pressures:
the growing social security imbalances and the fiscal profligacy of Brazil's state
governments. Congress on November 4 approved by a wide margin a social security reform
measure that caps pension payments to civil servants.
Financial market responses to these developments have been positive, with reserve
outflows diminishing, the stock market rising, and some measures of interest rates declining
somewhat, although they still remain high. The letter of intent for an IMF program to support
Brazil's adjustment measures, along with additional financing by the World Bank, Inter-
American Development Bank, and official bilateral creditors, is now expected, after several
delays, to be announced shortly.IV-31

In Argentina, declining industrial production in September fell below its level 12-
months earlier, suggesting that economic activity is beginning to contract. The
unemployment rate in August was unchanged from the previous job survey in May. Inflation
remained low, with the 12-month consumer price inflation rate falling to under
1 percent in October. The trade balance continues to show a significant deficit; in the third
quarter, the trade deficit of more than $5 billion (AR) compares with a deficit of about
$3 billion (AR) in the year-earlier period.
On the financial front, there has been relative improvement. The stock market has
rallied to make up some of the losses incurred since mid-August. Domestic interest rates
have come down in recent weeks; the rate on 30-day peso deposits is back to its pre-Russian
devaluation level of about 8 percent. Total bank deposits and international reserves have not
fallen from their mid-August levels. However, there has been a modest shift of about 7
percent from peso-denominated to dollar-denominated deposits. Also, Brady spreads, despite
falling in recent weeks, remain elevated relative to the levels prevailing just before the
Russian devaluation.IV-32

The Venezuelan economy has moved modestly into a recession, with real GDP
contracting about 1/2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. This decline in activity
continued into the third quarter, as indicated by automobile sales, which plunged about 40
percent in September from a year-earlier. Inflation remains high, although it moderated
slightly in October. In addition to weak oil prices, an overvalued currency has contributed to
continuing weak external balances; the non-oil trade deficit of $11 billion (AR) in August
compares to a deficit of about $8 1/2 billion (AR) in the year-earlier month.
In mid-October, the Venezuelan Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund was finally put in
place. This fund is intended to smooth the effects of swings in oil prices by storing windfall
oil revenues to be used in times of need. In political developments, the newly formed
alliance of the radical presidential candidate, Hugo Chavez, was the clear winner in the
congressional elections held on November 8, taking about 35 percent of the total seats. The
presidential elections are scheduled for December 6. In the presidential race, Henrique Salas,
the candidate favored by the business community, has considerably narrowed Chavez's lead
in the polls.IV-33

The Russian economy remains in crisis. Real GDP has contracted sharply, with the
September level 10 percent below that of the previous year; prices in September were more
than 50 percent above their year-ago level. The ruble has lost over 60 percent of its value
since the government defaulted on its domestic debt and abandoned the ruble corridor in mid-
August. The banking system has been paralyzed by the debt freeze as well as by the large
losses incurred by the many banks with sizable dollar-denominated obligations. The chaos in
the banking system has exacerbated the impact of the sharp rise in costs on the volume of
imports, as many importers have been unable to obtain credit to make payments. Domestic
payments have been disrupted as well, further depressing economic activity. The monetary
base rose by about 17 percent between August and October as the central bank has sought to
prop up the banking system, and is likely to increase sharply further if the government
follows through on its promises to pay back sizable wage and pension arrears.
As the crisis has deepened, the new government has yet to produce a convincing plan
for economic revival. The latest anti-crisis plan, currently under debate in the Duma,
reportedly contains a list of measures that suggest increased government intervention in the
economy. The 1999 budget, which should indicate how much monetary expansion will be
necessary to fund the plan, will not be released until December 1. Financing of the plan is
also contingent on whether additional foreign aid will be available; Russian officials continue
to hope some money will be forthcoming, although the IMF is still unsatisfied with the plans
that have been presented so far. Negotiations with foreign creditors on debt rescheduling are
also continuing, with investors remaining dissatisfied with the terms that have been offered.IV-34
