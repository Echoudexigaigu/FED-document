DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economy continued to surge in the fourth quarter. All sectors of
domestic final demand were strong, driving solid gains in employment and
income. Topping off the good news, inflation remained low despite the
pressures on labor supplies.
Little statistical information is available for the current quarter, but what there
is suggests some step-down in the growth of real GDP--the deceleration being
centered in the motor vehicle sector, which contributed disproportionately to
the late 1998 strength in activity.
Labor Market Developments
Private nonfarm payrolls jumped 319,000 in December, bringing the average
monthly increase in the fourth quarter to 229,000--up from the average of
203,000 for the first three quarters of the year. The unemployment rate
ticked down another tenth of a percentage point, to 4.3 percent, in December,
returning to the low end of the narrow range that has prevailed since April.
Employment rose sharply during the fourth quarter, particularly in December,
in the construction and the service-producing industries. Capping a robust
quarter, construction payrolls soared 104,000 last month, boosted by strong
underlying housing demand and unseasonably mild weather. Hiring in retail
trade remained brisk at 53,000 in December. Gains at eating and drinking
establishments accounted for half of this rise, but hefty increases also were
reported at department stores, building materials and garden supply stores,
auto dealers, and service stations. Hiring at finance, insurance, and real estate
firms also remained robust last month. In the services industry, employment
gains in business services (especially help- supply and computer and data-
processing services), agricultural services, and engineering and management
services accounted for much of the growth in December.
Factory payrolls dropped another 13,000 in December, the smallest decline in
several months. Employment levels in the apparel and textiles industries
continued their long slides; industrial machinery and electronic equipment
also exhibited considerable weakness, as firms responded to the weakening
international trade picture. Since March, manufacturers have cut 272,000
jobs, and this figure may underestimate the total job loss directly associated
with the troubles in the sector because anecdotal reports suggest that help-
supply firms have been able to place fewer temporary workers at industrial
establishments.
With both private employment and the average workweek rising in December,
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls increased 0.5 percent (not at an annual rate). For the fourth quarter

as a whole, aggregate hours were up at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, after
having increased 1.6 percent in the third quarter. However, once we correct
for a seasonal-adjustment problem with the September workweek, the growth
rates are more even--closer to 2 percent in each quarter.
Data from the household survey point to tight labor markets at year-end.
The unemployment rate in December moved back down to its low for the
year, and the labor force participation rate returned to its earlier high of
67.2 percent. The percentage of the population (aged 16 to 64) not in the
labor force who want jobs fell last quarter, after having held fairly steady
over the first three quarters of the year. The uptrend in labor force
participation among women maintaining families continued through year-end--
no doubt influenced by welfare reform and the strong economy.
Some of the other readings of labor market conditions suggest that labor
markets were still tight at year-end, but indicators of expected conditions have
softened a bit recently. The Bureau of National Affairs' survey of positions
that are hard to fill suggested that shortages, while less pressing at year-end
than earlier in 1998, remained well above those reported during the late
1980s. At the same time, the National Federation of Independent Businesses'
survey of small firms showed no real let-up in labor shortages. Respondents
to the January Conference Board Survey of households noted a continued
high level of job availability currently. The organization's index of help-
wanted advertising remained at a historically high level in the fourth quarter
of 1998 though a bit lower than earlier in the year. However, respondents to
the Michigan and Conference Board surveys were less optimistic about the
outlook for employment than they were last summer, although their
employment expectations are still relatively positive.
After having moved up into the mid-to-upper 300,000s in late December and
early January, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance dropped
back to 301,000 in the week ended January 23--similar to the readings in
mid-December. This pattern suggests that the run-up around the turn of the
year was, as had been suspected, the result of extremely harsh weather and,
possibly, seasonal adjustment difficulties. The recent level remains consistent
with solid net gains in jobs.

Industrial Production
After having decelerated substantially in the third quarter, industrial
production increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
even though the output of mines and utilities declined significantly. Much of
the strength in the fourth quarter reflects the effects of a surge in the
production of motor vehicles and parts, which also bolstered a variety of
supplier industries.' Moreover, output of construction supplies continued to
grow swiftly, and high-tech industries--computers, communications equipment,
and semiconductors--again posted huge gains. Elsewhere, however,
production remained weak. On balance, manufacturing production expanded
at a 5.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter--about the same pace as productive
capacity. As a result, the factory operating rate remained unchanged at
80.2 percent, the lowest year-end level in six years.
In December, motor vehicle assemblies edged down to 12.8 million units
(annual rate), a still-elevated, post-strike level that boosted production of
motor vehicles and parts nearly 40 percent in the fourth quarter. Despite the
effort to rebuild strike-depleted stocks, the strong pace of sales has kept
inventories lean, and manufacturers expect to maintain assemblies at relatively

high levels, at least through the first quarter of 1999. Available weekly data
suggest that assemblies will remain at about a 12.8 million unit annual rate in
January, well below schedules for the month but consistent with
manufacturers' quarterly plans. Output of aircraft and parts also fell slightly
in December from a very high level and is expected to decline further during
the next two years: The staffs price-weighted index of airplanes completed
by Boeing reached a high in December. Boeing plans to reduce the pace of
assemblies in 1999 and in 2000.
Production of semiconductors, computers, and communications equipment
increased substantially again in December. The output of semiconductors and
related electronic components surged at an annual rate of 50 percent in the
fourth quarter after having increased 38 percent in the third quarter. The
recent advances followed much smaller gains of around 9 percent, on average,
in the first half of last year, when the glut of inventories took its toll of
domestic production. Production of computer and office equipment also
jumped 50 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter, bringing the rise in
1998 to 54 percent--significantly more than the average increase of 41 percent
in the previous three years. Output of communications equipment fell
6 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter owing to a substantial decline in
the production of telephone apparatus. However, for the year as a whole, the
output of communications equipment increased about 6 percent.
Manufacturing production outside the transportation and high-tech industries
was little changed over the four quarters of 1998. Although output of
manufactured construction supplies rose substantially, the production of
consumer goods declined almost 1 percent, and production of other business
equipment posted only a 1 percent gain. Despite a sharp increase in the
production of construction machinery, the weak foreign demand for farm
products and the low price of oil severely curtailed the growth of farm
machinery and gas and oil field machinery last year. Materials production
was held down by the steady decline in steel production and by widespread
weakness within nondurable materials.
Anecdotal evidence from the Beige Book is consistent with the mixed trends
seen in manufacturing production. Motor vehicle production and
construction-related manufacturing were reported to have been quite strong in
December. Nonetheless, almost every District noted some manufacturers who
were hurt by weak exports, although incoming orders for the semiconductor
industry are positive. In addition, the Beige Book reported that conditions in
the energy and mining sectors worsened late last year. U.S. rig counts are
near post-World War II lows, and producers of energy products were reported
to have cut exploration, capital spending, and production plans.

Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Consumer spending remained robust through year-end. In December, nominal
outlays in the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive
dealers and building material and supply stores, increased 0.3 percent after
having risen 0.5 percent in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole,
spending at retail control outlets rose 4.6 percent (annual rate). Nominal
expenditures at apparel stores fell back in December after two months of
hefty increases, but sales at furniture and appliance stores rose briskly.
Although the strength partly reflects the robust housing market, purchases at
these stores have grown rapidly in recent years, even during periods when
home sales weakened; the category includes stores that sell a considerable
volume of home electronics and computers, for which favorable pricing and

new products have spurred demand. Indeed, recent anecdotal reports suggest
that sales of personal computers were very strong in December.2
Based on the retail sales figures and the reported declines in prices for items
in the retail control group, the staff estimates that real personal consumption
expenditures for goods other than motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of
4-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter. After factoring in the sharp rise in motor
vehicle outlays, we estimate that consumer spending on all goods surged at an
annual rate of more than 8-1/2 percent in the final quarter of the year.
In contrast to the rapid increase in expenditures for goods last quarter, warm
weather in late November and early December depressed real outlays for
energy services in both months. Spending on non-energy services posted
moderate gains in October and November. Weakness in brokerage services
offset to some extent robust gains in spending for recreational services and
steadily rising outlays for transportation, medical, and personal care services.3
After a mild December, temperatures for the nation as a whole have been a
bit closer to normal so far in January, which should generate a small increase
in spending for electricity and natural gas this month, and brokerage services
should receive a boost from the rise in trading volume seen early this year.
Consumer spending continues to be supported by strong gains in real income
and net worth. Real disposable personal income increased an average of
1/4 percent per month over October and November. In December, the jump
in production worker hours and wages, along with the moderate rise in overall
consumer prices, likely will produce a sizable gain in real incomes. Although
the ratio of net worth to disposable personal income fell in the third quarter,
the rebound in equity markets pushed the ratio to new high ground by year-
end.
Consumers evidently remain quite confident. The Michigan Survey Research
Center index of consumer confidence edged up in early January; the
Conference Board's index of consumer confidence also moved up this week.
In both, respondents were more upbeat about current conditions, and their
assessments of expected conditions were little changed.
2. For example, PC Data Inc. estimates that unit sales of personal computers at retail
outlets in December were 41 percent above the level a year earlier, with the strongest demand
for PCs priced under $1,000.
3. The BEA estimates real brokerage services based on stock market volume on the
NASDAQ, New York, and American stock exchanges. The combined volume on these
exchanges fell in November and December.

Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles surged in December to an annual rate of 17.2 million
units, an increase of almost 2 million units from the already strong pace in
November. The jump last month reflected not only the generally favorable
fundamentals of consumer demand but also year-end sales pushes, as GM
sought to regain lost market share and other automakers battled for top car
and truck sales titles. The December volume no doubt has taken something
away from early 1999, and the manufacturers are expecting sales to step down
sharply in January.
Nonetheless, the outlook for sales still appears favorable--in part because
consumers perceive pricing to be attractive. U.S. auto producers have
evidently achieved cost savings sufficient to permit them to hold down prices
and still register substantial profits--particularly on the popular light truck
lines. In the early-January Michigan SRC survey, consumers' appraisals of
buying conditions for cars climbed to the highest level since 1986, boosted by
improvements in consumers' views on pricing and interest rates. In contrast,
the Conference Board index of buying plans for autos retreated in January.
The divergence between the two measures of consumer sentiment may reflect
the different objectives of the two surveys: The Michigan SRC index
appraises general car-buying conditions while the Conference Board index
measures perceived plans to buy a motor vehicle in the next six months. The
drop in the Conference Board index is perhaps indicative of the large number
of consumers who have recently bought a vehicle and, thus, are less likely to
buy a car in early 1999--a reading that is consistent with the expectation of a
near-term moderation in sales from the strong fourth-quarter pace.
Business demand for medium and heavy trucks continues to be exceptionally
strong. Shipments set a new record of 596,000 units at an annual rate during
the fourth quarter, smashing the previous record of 542,000 units that was set
in the third quarter. Net new orders for heavy trucks firmed in December but
remained noticeably below the highs reached earlier in the year. Nonetheless,
a high level of backlogs suggests that production and shipments should remain
little changed at a high level in the near term.
Housing Markets
All measures of housing activity continue to indicate a very robust market.
Particularly noteworthy is the strength of the single-family segment, in which
starts were little changed in December, thereby maintaining one of the highest
levels in twenty years. Sales of new homes set a new record in November, as
did sales of existing homes in December.
For the fourth quarter as a whole, single-family starts averaged a whopping
1.34 million units at an annual rate. Unusually favorable weather enabled

builders to work on satisfying a backlog of demand by extending the normal
construction season in some areas. On a not-seasonally-adjusted basis, single-
family starts dropped less than half as much as they usually do during the
September-December period.
Sales of new homes remained strong into early January, according to the
National Association of Home Builders' monthly survey of builders, and
applications for mortgages to finance home purchases remained at a high
level, though below the record reached late last year. The Michigan survey's
index of homebuying attitudes dropped back a bit in early January after
having recorded a new high in December. Respondents have continued to
note that the low level of mortgage rates is a key reason that homebuying is
attractive.
On an annual average basis, the rate on thirty-year conventional fixed-rate
mortgages declined in each of the past four years. At 6.77 percent, the
average rate in the fourth quarter of 1998 was the lowest in the twenty-seven-
year history of the benchmark series published by Freddie Mac. Besides low
rates, however, the house sales undoubtedly have been boosted by rapid
employment growth, gains in net worth, and special financing programs
designed to broaden opportunities for homeownership by reducing down
payments.
The year-over-year increases in the average and median prices of new homes
sold fell in November to 0 and 3 percent, respectively, both of which are
toward the low end of the range seen over the past year. Year-over-year
increases in the average and median prices for existing homes sold dipped in
December; on a quarterly-average basis, these prices were 4-1/2 to 5 percent
higher than a year earlier. That rate of change is roughly the rate recorded
for the repeat-sales price index for existing homes in the third quarter (the
latest data).
Multifamily housing starts fell back slightly in the fourth quarter to an annual
rate of 354,000 units. Indicators of underlying conditions in the multifamily
market are mixed. Residential rent continued to increase in real terms
through the end of last year. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental housing,
which is not seasonally adjusted, fell in the fourth quarter of 1998 to a level a
bit below its level a year ago. However, the annual average of the vacancy
rate, which may be a better indicator of underlying trends, has been about
unchanged since 1994.
Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment appears to have increased substantially in the
fourth quarter, after having paused in the prior quarter. In particular,

equipment spending picked up markedly, and nonresidential construction
strengthened, on balance, over the first two months of the quarter.
Producers' durable equipment. Most of the rebound in real expenditures on
producers' durable equipment in the fourth quarter was attributable to a
sizable bounceback in businesses' purchases of motor vehicles and a pickup in
deliveries of aircraft to domestic carriers. Excluding the erratic transportation
sector, equipment spending seems to have increased at about the same brisk
pace last quarter as in the third quarter, although it is still down from the
extremely rapid rate registered in the first half of the year.
The "high-technology" sectors of PDE continue to look strong. Although
nominal shipments of office and computing equipment slowed in the fourth
quarter, domestic businesses appear to have accelerated their purchases of
computing equipment from abroad. On balance, the staff estimates that real
expenditures on office and computing equipment increased at an annual rate
of 44 percent, just off the third-quarter pace. Anecdotal evidence indicates
that nominal computer shipments probably picked up in January. Notably,
IBM's orders have been quite strong this month, partly because of the
popularity of its S/390 computers--a line aimed at businesses engaging in
electronic commerce; S/390 sales are a small share of IBM revenues, but
demand for these machines has exploded recently.
Real outlays for communications equipment are estimated to have accelerated
to an annual growth rate of 18 percent in the fourth quarter. Nominal
shipments of communications equipment rose 4.4 percent (not at an annual
rate) last quarter, and prices continued to fall moderately. The outlook for
spending in this sector remains upbeat: Bookings for communications
equipment rose at a 4.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter, and the backlog of
unfilled orders increased.
Business expenditures on aircraft appear to have provided a modest boost to
producers' durable equipment in the fourth quarter. Boeing reportedly
delivered a record number of planes last quarter, and the share delivered to
domestic businesses appears to have remained stable.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, real domestic equipment
spending appears to have slowed to a 2-1/4 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Although nominal shipments rose 1.5 percent (not at an annual rate), a bit
above the third-quarter pace, a large share of the fourth-quarter shipments
apparently were exported. New orders declined 4.6 percent last quarter, held
down by a large decrease in new bookings of engines and turbines.
Excluding this sector, which has registered large monthly fluctuations of late,
new orders fell 1.4 percent.

Nonresidential structures. Nonresidential building activity appears to have
increased moderately in the fourth quarter. Estimates of construction
spending in September and October were revised up substantially because of
an unusually large number of late reports of construction contracts. In
November, construction of nonresidential buildings was about flat, leaving
nominal outlays in October and November, on average, up 8 percent (annual
rate) from their third-quarter level. Among the major components,
construction of office buildings increased in October and November, as did
commercial construction, which includes stores and warehouses. However,
consistent with the subpar rate of capacity utilization in many manufacturing
industries, industrial construction continued to ebb, and building of lodging
facilities decreased sharply in November, which more than offset an increase
in October.
The availability of financing appears to be little changed in recent weeks.
Gross issuance of CMBSs surged in the fourth quarter, more than doubling
the sharply curtailed flow during the third quarter, but most of these issues
reflected securitization of loans purchased some time ago rather than new
funding. Anecdotal reports suggest that mortgage loans are available to those
with good credit and sound projects, but with terms that reflect the more
cautious lending criteria that took hold after the disruption of financial
markets late last summer. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in
January found that, on a net basis, 15 percent of commercial banks had
tightened their lending standards for commercial real estate loans compared
with 46 percent three months earlier.
Business Inventories
For manufacturing and trade establishments excluding motor vehicles, the
book value of inventories rose at an annual rate of $27 billion, on average, in
October and November. This was down $7 billion from the third-quarter
pace, but the stock-sales ratio held steady. Dealer inventories of new motor
vehicles remain quite lean relative to the pace of sales that the companies
expect to prevail in the near term.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of $18.2 billion, on average,
in the first two months of the quarter, up from the $7.4 billion pace posted in
the third quarter.4 Inventory investment outside of the aircraft industry
averaged moderate increases in October and November after a $1.3 billion
4. The figures cited in the text are Census book-value numbers. However, in the NIPA,
manufacturers' book-value stocks rose $12.8 billion at an annual rate in the third quarter. The
difference between the Census and NIPA figures almost entirely reflects stocks purchased by
private businesses from the federal government when it sold the United States Enrichment
Corporation. This purchase was counted in the NIPA but not in the Census figures.

rise, at an annual rate, in the third quarter, while stocks of aircraft and parts
were little changed, on balance. The November inventory-shipments ratio for
manufacturing as a whole was near the middle of the narrow range that has
prevailed for the past two years. Nonetheless, inventory overhangs persist at
producers of chemicals and--to a less dramatic degree--steel and paper.
The book value of wholesale trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose
at a $7.1 billion annual pace in October and November, well off the
$24.5 billion rate of accumulation posted in the third quarter. The farm
products sector accounted for most of the swing, as the early harvest moved
some of the usual seasonal accumulation of farm products forward from
October to August and September. On average, inventory investment was
also lower in October and November in nearly every other category of
wholesaling. Nevertheless, stock-to-sales ratios at metals and minerals,
machinery, and chemicals wholesalers remained very elevated, despite slower
rates of accumulation in the fourth quarter. Apparently, production cuts in the
domestic manufacturing industries associated with these wholesale categories
were not sufficient to reduce wholesale inventories, perhaps, in part, because
of increased import penetration.
In the retail trade sector, non-auto inventories rose at a very small $1.8 billion
annual rate, on average, in October and November--the same rate as in the
third quarter. Retail sales have remained robust, and the inventory-sales ratio
has stepped down somewhat over the past seven months. The retail
inventory-sales ratio (excluding motor vehicles) in November was the lowest
since 1981.
Federal Government Sector
According to Monthly Treasury Statements, the federal budget deficit for the
October-December period totaled $55 billion. However, the deficit was
boosted by a surge in social security outlays that reflected a shift in benefit
payments from early January to December 31.5 Excluding such timing shifts,
as well as deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, the deficit was
only $18 billion, about $13 billion under the year-earlier level. On this
adjusted basis, the budget posted a surplus of $73 billion over the twelve
months ending in December, compared with a deficit of $20 billion over the
preceding year.
Despite the enactment of the fiscal year 1999 emergency spending bill last
fall, national defense spending in nominal terms fell about 1 percent in the
5. Such a shift is unusual, occurring only when the first three days of January are not
business days, which was the case this year.

October-December period from the year-earlier level. These figures point to
little change in NIPA defense purchases in the fourth quarter.6 In addition,
NIPA federal government compensation in real terms is estimated to have
been held down about $1 billion in the fourth quarter because civilian
employees were given a half-day off on Christmas Eve; employee salaries--
and nominal compensation--are not affected by this leave, and the
corresponding price deflator is increased.
Federal tax receipts in the October-December period were 6.8 percent higher
than the year-earlier level.7 The 7 percent growth in individual income and
payroll taxes was fueled by the strong December inflow of withheld taxes.
Withheld tax deposits reported in the Daily Treasury Statement for the
January 1 through January 26 period were about 10 percent above year-earlier
levels. This increase, combined with the strong December figures, suggests
that bonuses may continue to be an important factor in receipts growth. The
Daily Treasury Statement also reports that nonwithheld income tax receipts in
the January 1-26 period increased only 5 percent over the comparable year-
earlier period. A 7 percent decline in corporate income taxes in the final
three months of last year reflected a sizable increase in refunds.
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of state and local spending in the fourth quarter remain mixed.
Employment jumped 80,000 in December, the largest increase since August.
Much of the rise was at state and local educational facilities and appears to
reflect the early timing of the survey week before most colleges and other
schools began the winter holidays. Nonetheless, hiring at state and local
governments has accelerated somewhat, particularly in the second half of
1998. The increase is fairly widespread across categories and likely reflects
the continued strong fiscal position of most of these governments. In
contrast, real construction spending by state and local governments was
reported to have fallen, on average, during the first two months of the fourth
quarter.
6. The bombs, missiles, and other defense expendables used in December during
Operation Desert Fox will not have any effect on the NIPA defense figures in the fourth
quarter. In general, if such expendables are sufficiently large in dollar value, the BEA
convention is to reduce the federal government capital stock; depreciation or consumption of
fixed government capital would not be affected, and, hence, GDP would be unaffected. In the
case of Operation Desert Fox, the loss of expendables was deemed too small in dollar terms
to make a dent in the capital stock. Over time, of course, federal defense expenditures would
be affected as replacements are purchased.
7. The large increase in "other" revenues resulted primarily from a provision of the 1997
Taxpayer Relief Act that allowed firms to defer the payment of August and September excise
taxes until October; the allowance was made for 1998 only.

In a recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislators, thirty-nine
states reported that revenues came in above initial forecasts in fiscal 1998. At
the same time, expenditures were nearly in line with projections, and all of
the states reported positive year-end balances. Looking ahead, states are
reporting continuing healthy finances in fiscal 1999--which is about half over
for most states. Most states expect revenues this year to come in on target or
above, although eight states and the District of Columbia are anticipating
actual reductions in receipts.8 All of the states expect to end fiscal 1999 with
balanced budgets.
Prices
Inflation remains low. Over the twelve months of 1998, the consumer price
index increased 1.6 percent, a shade less than in 1997. It was the best annual
figure since 1986, when oil prices fell even more sharply than they did last
year and the CPI rose just 1.1 percent. Excluding food and energy, the CPI
increased 2.4 percent over the twelve months of 1998, up from 2.2 percent in
1997.
In December the CPI increased 0.1 percent after two months of 0.2 percent
increases. Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 percent last month
after five consecutive months of 0.2 percent increases. However, in the wake
of the settlement between the states and tobacco makers, tobacco prices shot
up 18 percent in December; were it not for tobacco, the core CPI would have
risen just 0.1 percent in December.
The CPI for food was unchanged in December, as declines for pork, poultry,
and fresh fruits and vegetables offset increases elsewhere. Over the twelve
months of 1998, food prices rose 2.3 percent, about the same pace as core
prices and a somewhat faster pace than in 1997. That outcome is a little
puzzling. Food prices have tended to rise less rapidly than core inflation over
the past decade or so, and the big declines in farm commodity prices in 1998
seemingly should have reinforced that tendency, even though the farm share
of the food market basket has declined further this decade. Rising labor costs
in the food industries do not seem to explain the discrepancy: The past year
brought larger increases in hourly earnings in some food industries but
smaller increases in others and a deceleration overall. Because the lags
between farm prices and food prices are not altogether predictable, the effects
8. The eight states are Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, Vermont, and
Wyoming. The expected decreases are less than 2 percent in six of the states and generally
can be explained by tax cuts or conservative forecasts. The biggest drops are in Alaska,
reflecting weaker oil prices, and in Vermont, where one-time general fund revenues will not
continue.

of declining commodity prices may yet show through more strongly in the
months ahead.
Consumer energy prices fell 1.4 percent in December. Prices of gasoline,
heating oil, and natural gas all fell, while electricity rates were unchanged.
For 1998 as a whole, energy prices fell 9 percent, primarily the result of
lower world oil prices.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy rose 0.6 percent in
December, but excluding tobacco products as well, it would have fallen
0.2 percent last month. Used car prices dropped 0.6 percent in December
after three months of rapid increases, and apparel prices registered a steep
decline. Although apparel prices frequently are plagued by seasonal
adjustment problems, December's decline does not appear to reflect such
difficulties. Over the twelve months through December, commodity prices
excluding food and energy rose 1.3 percent; excluding tobacco too, the
increase was just 0.1 percent.
In 1998, prescription drug prices in the CPI increased 5 percent on a twelve-
month change basis, up from a 2-1/2 percent rise in 1997. Because the CPI
only captures out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs, the weight of
prescription drugs in the CPI is quite small--0.8 percent--and thus this pickup
did not have a discernible affect on the overall index. However, prescription
drugs play a bigger role in the costs of insurers, and the acceleration in
prescription drug prices is reported to be having a more important effect on
health insurance costs.
The index for services other than energy rose 0.2 percent in December after a
0.3 percent increase in November. The index for shelter was up 0.2 percent
in December, as a 0.3 percent rise in owners' equivalent rent was partly offset
by a reduction in the price of lodging-away-from-home. Airfares rose
1.0 percent after having dropped 2 percent in November. Over the twelve
months of 1998, non-energy services prices increased 3.0 percent--the same
rate as in 1997.
For the four-quarter period ending in the third quarter of 1998, the chain price
index for GDP rose 1.0 percent, about 1/2 percentage point less than the
increase in the CPI. While rapidly declining capital equipment prices have
been one factor contributing to the lower pace of GDP inflation, the chain
price index for personal consumption expenditures has also increased less than
the CPI: Over the four quarters ended in the third quarter of last year, the
PCE chain price index increased 0.7 percent, nearly 1 percentage point less
than the rise in the CPI over this period. We expect part of the divergence

(0.2 percentage point) to narrow this year as a result of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' adoption of geometric weighting of entry-level items; PCE prices
already incorporate the geometric-weighted CPIs that the BLS has published
on an experimental basis. Beyond that, PCE prices have been held down of
late by unusually rapid deceleration in prices of some components (such as
imputed service charges) that are poorly measured and extremely volatile.
Prices of capital equipment continue to be soft: The producer price index for
capital equipment fell 0.1 percent in December, after a 0.1 percent increase in
November. For 1998 as a whole, capital equipment prices were about
unchanged. Computer prices, however, appear to have declined less rapidly
in recent months than earlier in the year. The PPI for computers fell at an
annual rate of 22 percent in the fourth quarter, somewhat less than the
27 percent pace of decline in the first three quarters of the year.
The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy fell 0.2 percent
in December, about the same as the monthly declines since September. The
PPI for crude materials other than food and energy dropped 2 percent in
December, almost matching the declines in October and November. Prices of
raw materials have been mixed since PPI prices were collected in mid-
December. Steel scrap prices have rebounded in recent weeks, and prices of
other metals have flattened out following steep declines in the second half of
last year. Among foods, hog prices have moved up considerably since mid-
December--from a very low level--while prices of most major crops have
moved down further. Crude oil prices have moved up somewhat recently,
although they remain at levels that are very low by historical standards.
After declining earlier this year, most measures of inflation expectations
changed little in recent quarters. The median response to the Michigan
survey's question on inflation expectations over the next twelve months
averaged 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, the same as in the third quarter.
However, the January reading suggests an uptick in inflation expectations, but
it is a preliminary figure and may well be revised. Longer-term inflation
expectations have been stable recently, with the median Michigan five-to-ten-
year expectations unchanged for the past year at around 2.8 percent and the
Professional Forecasts ten-year expectations flat at 2.5 percent.
Labor Costs
According to the Employment Cost Index, hourly compensation of private
industry workers rose at an annual rate of only 2.9 percent over the three
months ended in December; the moderate rise reduced the twelve-month
change in the ECI from 3.8 percent in September to 3.5 percent in December.
Wages and salaries of private industry workers also increased more

moderately in the latest three-month period, dropping the twelve-month
change from 4.3 percent in September to 3.9 percent in December. In large
part, the step-down reflects a more modest rise in the finance, insurance, and
real estate industry, where intense activity had boosted compensation gains
earlier in the year. Excluding FIRE, we estimate that hourly compensation
rose 3-1/4 percent during 1998 and that wages and salaries increased
3-1/2 percent; both figures are roughly similar to their 1996 and 1997 rates.

7 percent for a second year in 1998, continuing to outpace other broad
industry categories. Wages in wholesale trade posted a significant
acceleration last year, rising 5.8 percent following a 3.1 percent increase in
1997. Wages in manufacturing also accelerated last year, by 1/2 percentage
point, to a 3.5 percent pace. By contrast, wages in services and in retail trade
decelerated last year, perhaps reflecting the waning effects of the 1996 and
1997 minimum wage increases.
Hourly benefits costs rose at a 2.5 percent annual over the three months ended
in December. Over the twelve months of 1998, the ECI for hourly benefits
moved up 2.4 percent, about the same as in 1997. Beneath this steady and
moderate rise are some notable cross currents. Health insurance costs
increased 2.3 percent in 1998 after having risen less than 1 percent in each of
the preceding three years. According to a recent survey of large employers
by the Towers-Perrin consulting firm, health insurance costs will likely rise
even faster in 1999 than in 1998.9  However, benefit costs in other areas
have been decelerating, to a large degree reflecting the strong economy: Costs
for state-run unemployment insurance fell nearly 8 percent in 1998, as
experience ratings improved with the drop in unemployment. Employer costs
of retirement programs slowed to a modest 2 percent increase last year after
having risen 6-1/2 percent as recently as 1996; the booming stock market cuts
the costs to employers of funding defined-benefit pension plans, contributing
to the deceleration in this area.
9. The Towers-Perrin survey suggests that health insurance rates rose 4 percent in 1998
and will rise 7 percent this year. The Towers-Perrin figures differ from the ECI in both
coverage and concept: They survey only large firms, in contrast to the universal coverage of
the ECI. And they ask about the change in the overall cost of health insurance, including
both the employer's and employee's cost, whereas the ECI asks only about the employer's
cost.

DOMESTIC FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Credit markets made it through the much-feared year-end without incident,
and the equity market extended its remarkable rally into 1999. The mid-
January devaluation and then floating of the Brazilian real provided much
less of a jolt to the markets than the Russian crisis in mid-August. The
prospect of weaker earnings from Latin American business weighed on some
companies' share prices, but the major indexes are still up on balance since
the December 22 FOMC meeting--the NASDAQ by a hefty amount, led by
gains on Internet and other "tech" stocks.
While the federal funds rate has remained at 4-3/4 percent, other short-term
market yields have declined since the December FOMC meeting, as year-end
premia in private securities unwound, and as investors were apparently
encouraged that the step-up in Treasury bill issuance was smaller than
expected. Long-term Treasury and private bond yields are little changed, on
net, over the intermeeting period, leaving corporate and mortgage spreads
over Treasuries unusually wide.
The wide spreads notwithstanding, low corporate rate levels have attracted an
increasing number of issuers back to capital markets after the usual year-end
lull. Partial data for January indicate that bank loans and commercial paper
also have turned up after contracting in December. Total business borrowing,
on net, in January appears to be near last year's pace. Gross equity issuance
was robust in December, and is showing signs of rebounding from a drop-off
early this year.
Borrowing by households grew rapidly in the fourth quarter. Low interest
rates have continued to fuel heavy home purchase and refinancing activity,
which has significantly increased mortgage debt. Consumer credit also grew
at a fast clip, as expenditures on consumer durables surged.
The Treasury increased its net borrowing through bills in the fourth quarter,
leading to a net paydown of coupon securities because of the modest overall
need for funds. State and local debt expanded briskly, capping a year of
near-record municipal issuance to raise new capital as well as to take
advantage of current interest rates for advance refunding.
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates continued rapid in December, with
much of the strength concentrated in money funds having attractive yields
relative to short-term Treasury securities and in liquid deposits. Both M2 and
M3 growth appear to have slowed in January. Bank credit growth decelerated
around year-end, partly reflecting sluggish business lending as
manybusinesses met their financing needs in capital markets. On the January
Senior Loan Officer survey, domestic banks reported essentially no further

tightening of standards but a little more firming of terms on loans to both
households and businesses.
Business Finance
Debt of nonfinancial corporations is estimated to have grown at an
8-1/2 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1998--a robust pace but off from
that of the first three quarters of the year. For the year, debt growth of
nonfinancial corporations is estimated to have been near 10 percent; in real
terms, this was the largest increase since 1986.
Since the December FOMC meeting, yields on investment-grade bonds have
remained virtually unchanged, leaving spreads relative to comparable
Treasuries wide by historical standards. However, the absolute level of yields
is low, providing ongoing support to new issuance. Offerings of investment-
grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations were sizable in December, with
almost two-thirds of the funds raised earmarked to pay down commercial
paper and bank loans. Issuance is estimated to have fallen in January.
Junk bond yields and spreads relative to Treasuries have not changed
appreciably since the last FOMC meeting. Activity in the junk bond market
continued to pick up in December, with gross offerings at $8-1/2 billion, the
most since June. The range of high-yield borrowers expanded in December
to include firms in a wider variety of sectors, such as waste systems,
equipment rental and leasing, health, and energy. As a result,
telecommunications firms, which had accounted for the bulk of funds raised
since August, made up only 20 percent of total high-yield bond issues in
December. In addition, firms with bond ratings of B- and below accounted
for nearly 40 percent of total junk bond issues in December, and yield spreads
on the lower-rated junk issues dropped slightly, indicating that investors may
have become a bit less risk-averse. High-yield offerings in January are on
pace to about match December's rate. After the usual lull at the beginning of
the year, the high-yield market heated up with a couple of large offerings that
were upsized in response to strong demand.
Commercial paper outstanding fell sharply in December but has more than
retraced that decline this month, as issuers have taken advantage of the drop
in yields after year-end. Quality spreads have narrowed as well: The yield
gap between thirty-day medium grade and prime commercial paper dropped
back from more than 70 basis points in mid-December to a more normal level
of about 20 basis points in January.
Most current indicators of credit performance for nonfinancial corporations
remain favorable. The ratio of failed-business liabilities to total liabilities in
1998 was about half that reported in 1997. For nonfinancial firms with bonds

outstanding, Moody's upgraded about the same amount of debt in the second
half of 1998 as it downgraded, and its Watchlist of debt under review points
to a small net upgrade in coming months. Median debt-to-asset ratios for
nonfinancial firms increased in the third quarter (the most recent data
available), especially for below-investment-grade firms, where this ratio is at
its highest level since 1992. Nonetheless, the ratio of cash flow to interest
expense for nonfinancial corporations has only slipped a bit, and the default
rate on junk bonds outstanding only crept up in 1998.
Equity prices rose sharply after the December FOMC meeting, with the broad
equity indexes reaching new highs in early January. Share prices then
retreated, owing, in part, to fears related to events in Brazil and to concerns
about earnings. But with a rebound in recent days, the DJIA and the S&P
500 are up 2 to 3 percent since the December FOMC meeting, while the
NASDAQ is up almost 13 percent because of its heavier weight on
technology firms. Internet stocks have continued to soar--they are up about
17 percent since year-end even after climbing nearly 150 percent in 1998--
although some are off from their highs of mid-January.
Gross public offerings of equity shares by nonfinancial corporations continued
to revive in December. Equity offerings by seasoned issuers increased, with
most of the proceeds used to fund acquisitions. IPO volume last month was
dominated by one large issuer (Infinity Broadcasting), but the fifteen IPOs
brought to market in December were twice the number in November. About
half of the issuers were Internet or computer software-related firms, and the
prices of these issues skyrocketed after being offered. Total issuance has
been slow in January, but is expected to strengthen in light of strong investor
interest and a pickup in the pace of registrations in the past two months.
Share repurchases and M&A activity, including the $48 billion acquisition of
Amoco by British Petroleum, led to a record $129 billion (not at an annual
rate) of equity retirements at U.S. nonfinancial corporations in the fourth
quarter. Retirements are expected to remain strong, based on the continued
heavy pace of share repurchase and merger announcements through year-end.
As in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the pending share retirements stemming
from mergers involve foreign purchases of U.S. companies, which entails the
retirement of U.S. equity and its replacement with foreign direct investment in
the flow of funds accounts.
About half of the S&P 500 firms have reported fourth-quarter earnings, and
these reports suggest that the four-quarter growth for S&P 500 earnings per
share was about zero--up from a negative 6-1/2 percent in the third quarter.
This swing largely reflects a rebound in earnings of technology firms. These
earnings reports suggest that NIPA economic profits will show a strong gain

in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, consistent with the robust
domestic economic activity in the fourth quarter. Since mid-December,
company analysts' projections for S&P 500 earnings growth in 1999 (on an
annual average basis) have decreased only a shade, to about 16 percent; only
energy producers have had their projected earnings marked down
significantly.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
After a spurt in November, the issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed
securities was light in December and appears to have remained so in January,
a typically slow month. For the first quarter as a whole, however, market
participants anticipate a healthy rebound as the overhang of mortgages
originated before mid-1998 is securitized.
With the passing of year-end, spreads on AAA-rated CMBSs have tightened a
bit, while spreads on lower-rated tranches have been unchanged or even
widened slightly. Freddie Mac and some of the Federal Home Loan Banks
are reported to be aggressive buyers of investment-grade securities. There are
still few buyers of the subordinate tranches, and the underwriting standards
for the mortgages in securitized pools remain tight relative to last summer.1
REIT stocks have continued to underperform the overall market: Share prices
fell nearly 22 percent in 1998 and have dropped slightly further this year,
with the hotel sector hit the hardest. Equity and public debt offerings by
REITs are down substantially from the pace of 1997 and early 1998, and, as a
result, their property acquisitions have slowed considerably. The REITs that
have continued property development and acquisition have increasingly turned
to alternative financing, including joint ventures with life insurance
companies, pension funds, or private developers. In such ventures the
partners frequently provide the initial funding, which does not show up on the
balance sheet of the REIT until an agreed-upon-later date when the REIT
buys out the partners.
Household Finances
Household balance sheets were strengthened by the run-up in equity prices at
the end of the year, and the ratio of net worth to income reached a new high.
However, households showed some signs of caution in acquiring risky assets.
Mutual fund shareholders added only $6 billion to domestic equity and hybrid
1. The buyer of the subordinate tranches buys all the tranches of a securitization below a
certain rating--usually BB. The buyer also serves as the special servicer of the mortgage pool.
One impediment to finding buyers for the subordinate tranches is that the buyer needs to be
able to service mortgages. The costs of servicing and the credit risk of the issue are
determined by the underwriting standards used for the underlying mortgages.

funds in December.2 International funds--including both stock and bond
funds--recorded outflows of almost $3 billion for the month, and $1 billion
flowed out of high-yield bond funds. Likewise, 401(k) pension plan holders
made some efforts to reduce their exposure to equities. Data for asset
allocation decisions by 401(k) holders in December indicate that they
transferred some of their existing plan assets from company stock and equity
funds to fixed-income investments, although total transfer activity for the
month involved only a little more than 1 percent of total plan balances.3
Nonetheless, the allocation of new contributions to these plans was about the
same as in prior months, with about two-thirds going to equity funds and
company stock. Weekly mutual fund flow data for about half of January,
provided by the ICI on a confidential basis, indicate that domestic equity fund
inflows were modest, and international funds were still experiencing outflows.
High-yield bond funds, however, experienced a resumption of inflows in early
January.
Household debt grew rapidly in the fourth quarter. Reflecting high levels of
both home purchase and refinancing activity, mortgage debt is estimated to
have increased at a 9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Consumer credit
grew at an average 7-1/4 percent rate in October and November. December
probably saw another sizable increase, given the strong spending on consumer
durables, especially automobiles. Consumer credit is estimated to have
accelerated in the fourth quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter in
which consumer credit growth has risen.
Indicators of household credit payment performance remain favorable.
Moody's reported that the delinquency rate on securitized credit card
receivables continued its year-long decline in November. The delinquency
rate at auto finance companies ticked up in November, but has fluctuated
within a fairly narrow band throughout 1998.
Issuance of asset-backed securities increased in December, lifting offerings for
the fourth quarter to around those of the third quarter. However, issuance of
subprime home equity securities for the fourth quarter was the lowest since
early 1997. This decline likely reflects a cutback in the availability of credit
2. Flows to equity and hybrid funds are typically below-average in December, partly
because households do not want to acquire the tax burden associated with the capital gains
distributions made during the month. However, the net flows to these funds this December
were more than 25 percent less than a year ago.
3. These monthly data are collected by Hewitt Associates, and track the contributions and
transfers of a large, representative sample of 401(k) participants at large corporations. In the
aggregate, 401(k) plans at large corporations represent more than half of the total assets in

to subprime borrowers, in the wake of notable difficulties experienced by
some subprime lenders and the reassessment of risk by the market late last
summer. Spreads on asset-backed securities have changed little since the last
FOMC meeting, and remain at relatively high levels.
Federal Government and Agency Finance
Because its overall need for borrowing was modest, the Treasury reduced the
size of its weekly bill auctions from $16 billion to $15 billion in mid-
December and used proceeds of bill sales in the fourth quarter to pay down
coupon securities. Since year-end, short-term yields have fallen roughly 5 to
10 basis points, caused, in part, by the smaller than expected supply. Rates at
intermediate and longer maturities likely have not followed short-term rates
down because they have been supported by generally strong incoming data on
the U.S. economy.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raised another $14 billion in funds through
offerings of their benchmark and reference securities in December, the
proceeds of which go to finance the purchase of mortgages and mortgage-
backed securities. Over the past year, Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's
portfolios of mortgage-related assets expanded 31 percent and 55 percent
respectively, as the agencies together added $190 billion of such holdings to
their balance sheets. Spreads between ten-year benchmark or reference notes
and Treasuries are about 60 basis points, down about 7 basis points since the
last FOMC, but they are still high relative to early last summer.
Municipal Finance
Gross long-term municipal issuance increased in December to $27-1/2 billion,
capping off a near-record year. Borrowing to raise new capital was strong,
particularly bolstered by the financing of transportation projects in the fourth
quarter. Nearly $10 billion of securities were sold to refund--currently or in
the future--outstanding municipal debt. Total offerings in January are
estimated to have come off this rapid pace but remain fairly strong. Rates on
municipal bonds persist at unusually low levels; however, muni yields are
high relative to Treasuries owing to weak institutional demand and continued
investor preference for more liquid Treasury securities.
Credit quality in the municipal bond market has continued to improve across
all sectors, except for issues used to finance health care facilities and some
utility projects. The fourth quarter of 1998 was the twelfth consecutive
quarter for which upgrades outnumbered downgrades in both number of issues
and dollar amount.

Money and Bank Credit
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remained rapid in December, as M2
expanded at a 10-1/2 percent rate and M3 advanced at an 11-1/2 percent
pace.4 Much of the recent strength has been concentrated in money funds and
liquid deposits. Money fund yields exceeded those on all Treasury bills, and
although the average rates offered on bank savings accounts are not especially
attractive, these accounts often are heavily tiered so that those with larger
balances earn higher rates of return, with some yields matching those on retail
money funds. Growth in M3 also was rapid last month, buoyed by continued
hefty flows into institution-only money funds, which offered attractive yields
and benefited from the persistent trend toward outsourcing of cash
management functions by many corporations. Recent weekly data suggest that
M2 and M3 growth may be slowing somewhat in January, although seasonal
swings in late December and early January make preliminary assessments
tenuous.
On balance, M2 and M3 expanded 8-3/4 percent and 11 percent, respectively,
over the four quarters of 1998. This rapid growth--and the associated
substantial decline in velocity--can be attributed partly to the declines in
short- and long-term interest rates. However, money growth was also boosted
by strong demands for liquidity and safety that accompanied the turmoil in
the second half of the year, and possibly by the efforts of some households to
rebalance their portfolios in light of the continued run up in equity prices.
Bank credit growth slowed markedly in December, and preliminary data in
January suggest a decline. The weakness in bank credit growth has been
evident in both securities and loans. Bank loans advanced at a tepid
4-3/4 percent pace in December with a decline in business loans accounting
for much of this deceleration. Business loans were especially weak at
Japanese institutions, but business lending at large domestic banks also
dropped off, at least in part because of strong corporate bond issuance.
Business loans appear to have picked up in January.
Anecdotal information suggests the bank syndicated loan market had been
subdued in advance of the year-end and that banks remained cautious in their
pricing of these loans. In response to questions on the January Senior Loan
Officer Survey, banks indicated that the syndicated loan market still had not
fully recovered, and that banks arranging syndications now require greater
flexibility in adjusting loan rates during the process in order to raise the
likelihood of a full subscription. Still, market contacts have noted that
January typically is a fairly slow month and that there are signs of a pickup

in new loan deals coming to market and increasing interest by institutional
investors who had been on the sidelines late last year.
Through much of the third and fourth quarters of last year, banks had been
rapidly expanding their securities portfolios. Banks responding to special
questions on the January Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated that they
viewed the return on debt securities as attractive relative to their cost of funds
over this period. However, securities growth has ebbed in recent weeks, most
notably at foreign (Japanese) institutions and at large domestic banks.
Available bank holding company earnings reports suggest that banks generally
remained profitable in the fourth quarter, owing to strong loan growth and
rising fee income. Nevertheless, many money center and some large regional
banks reported earnings setbacks, mostly associated with losses on foreign
operations and merger and restructuring expenses.

Appendix
January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices
The January 1999 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused primarily on changes over the past three months in the supply and demand
for bank loans to businesses and households.' Additional questions concerned the
rapid growth in securities at banks in the fourth quarter of 1998 and developments in
the market for syndicated commercial and industrial loans.
The survey results suggest that the broad tightening of business lending standards by
domestic banks observed in the September and November surveys has largely drawn
to a close; however, citing continued concern over the economic outlook, significant,
though smaller, fractions of participants indicated that they had firmed terms on loans
to large and middle-market businesses and standards and terms on commercial real
estate loans. The share of branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported
tightening lending standards and terms on business loans was large and down only a
little from November; for commercial real estate loans, the share of branches and
agencies reporting tighter standards and terms rose from the November survey.
Some respondents, mainly domestic, indicated that demand for commercial and
industrial loans had increased.
The survey found little evidence of substantial changes in lending practices with
respect to households. Several banks said that they were more willing to make
consumer installment loans, while modest percentages said that they had tightened
standards on credit cards. Standards and terms on other consumer loans were
reportedly little changed.
In responses to the additional questions, banks that had increased their holdings of
securities in the fourth quarter of 1998 said that they had done so in part because of
more attractive yields, a desire to increase the duration of their securities portfolios,
and a willingness to boost leverage. Many respondents reported some deterioration
in the condition of the market for syndicated loans--for example, its capacity to
absorb new credits without significant modification of terms--relative to six months
ago, although some judged the market to have improved. Many participants who
originate these loans reported that they had increased the use of "flexible pricing"
during the syndication period.2
Lending to Businesses
On net, only 7 percent of domestic respondents reported tightening lending standards
for commercial and industrial loans to large and middle-market firms, and a mere
4 percent, on net, reported tightening lending standards for small firms. (In the
1. This summary is based on a panel of fifty-five domestic respondents and twenty-three
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.
2. Flexible pricing is an agreement with the borrower to allow adjustments to the interest
rate and other loan terms during the syndication period.

III-A-2
November survey 37 percent and 15 percent reported tightening standards for larger
and small firms respectively.) By contrast, 56 percent, on net, of the branches and
agencies of foreign banks reported tightening standards for these loans in the past
three months, down only a bit from November.
Domestic respondents continued to report a tightening of business loan terms, but
these reports were not so widespread as in November. For example, 31 percent, on
net, reported widening loan spreads, down from 47 percent, on net, in November.
The most important reasons given for tightening were a less favorable, or more
uncertain, economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, and
decreased liquidity in the secondary loan market.3 Reports of tightening were much
more widespread at the branches and agencies of foreign banks than at domestic
banks.
In view of the general tightening of lending terms in recent months, banks were
asked a special question about the share of their outstanding revolving loan
commitments and other formal lending arrangements on which they would tighten
terms--including fees and spreads over base rates--if the commitments were maturing
and being repriced at the time of the survey. Seventy-seven percent of domestic
banks reported that they would tighten terms for less than a fifth of these
commitments. By contrast, over half of the branches and agencies of foreign banks--
which have been tightening credit standards and terms much more than domestic
banks for several months--would tighten on 80 percent or more of their outstanding
commitments.
Twenty percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported increased demand for
commercial and industrial loans from large and middle-market firms over the
previous three months, while 11 percent reported increased demand from small firms.
The most important reason given for the increase in demand, by a substantial margin,
was shifting customer borrowing from other sources that had become less attractive.
About 9 percent of foreign respondents, on net, reported stronger loan demand.
About 15 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported tightened standards on
commercial real estate loans, down from about 46 percent in November; similarly,
fewer banks tightened terms on these loans than in the previous survey. By contrast,
57 percent of the foreign respondents tightened standards on these loans, up from
44 percent in November. The percentage of foreign banks tightening terms on
commercial real estate loans also increased from the November survey. The primary
reasons given by domestic banks for tightening were disruptions in the commercial
mortgage-backed securities market, a less favorable, or more uncertain, economic
3. Of those domestic banks that reported tightening standards or terms on commercial and
industrial loans to large or middle-market firms, only 17 percent tightened standards
predominantly for middle-market firms, while 37 percent reported having tightened
predominantly for large firms. The remaining half of the respondents tightened about the
same for both types of borrowers.

III-A-3
outlook, and increased concern about the reliability of take-out financing. Foreign
respondents cited these reasons and a worsening of the condition or outlook for the
commercial real estate markets, a reduced tolerance for risk, and a deterioration in
their parent bank's current or expected capital position. About 30 percent of the
domestic and 23 percent of the foreign respondents reported an increase in demand
for commercial real estate loans. The most important reason given by domestic
banks for the increased demand was a shift in customer borrowing from lenders
having difficulty securitizing commercial mortgages. The branches and agencies of
foreign banks reported customer financing needs as the most important reason for the
reported increase in demand.
Loan Syndication
In response to special questions, half of the domestic banks and two-thirds of the
branches and agencies reported that the condition of the syndicated loan market--as
measured, for example, by its capacity to absorb new credits without significant
modification of terms--is worse now than it was six months ago, suggesting that
conditions in this market may not have completely recovered from the turmoil of fall
1998. However, a significant percentage of respondents found this market not to
have changed or even to have improved over this period. Among those domestic and
foreign respondents that originate syndicated loans and perceive the market to have
deteriorated, there has been an increased use of "flexible pricing" during the
syndication period to raise the likelihood of full subscription. There was much less
evidence that domestic respondents have trimmed originations in response to changes
in the market for syndicated loans, or that loans on banks' books have grown faster
than they otherwise would have because banks held a larger share of its originations.
Branches and agencies, however, did report having reduced originations of their loans
because of problems in the syndications market.
Lending to Households
About 14 percent of banks reported increased willingness to extend consumer
installment loans, up slightly from the previous survey. No banks reported a
decreased willingness to extend these credits. Seven percent, on net, reported having
tightened standards on credit-card loans, while standards for other consumer loans
were eased by one bank, on net. A few banks reported raising spreads a bit on credit
cards and other consumer loans. Three quarters of respondents reported unchanged
consumer loan demand, while the remaining respondents showed a small increase, on
net. Credit standards for mortgage loans were little changed, and 10 percent of
respondents, on net, reported increased demand for home mortgages, down
substantially from more than 50 percent in the November survey and the smallest
increase reported since mid-1997.4
4. The wording of this question has been revised to make it clearer that demand owing to
refinancing of existing mortgages is not to be considered when answering. The decline in the
net percentage reporting increased demand for home mortgages may reflect, in part, this
change.

III-A-4
In order to update staff estimates of household debt service requirements, two special
questions asked about the minimum required payment on outstanding balances for
credit cards now and in the late 1980s. The responses indicate that the minimum
payment has declined a bit over the decade, and it is now in the range of 2 percent to
3 percent of the balance outstanding.
Growth in Bank Securities
Thirty-six percent of domestic respondents reported increasing their securities
holdings in the fourth quarter of 1998, while 21 percent reduced their holdings. For
those large banks that reported increased securities holdings, the most important
reason given was that yields on some securities had increased relative to costs of
funds, thus making the securities more attractive investments. Banks also increased
holdings of long-term securities to compensate for the shorter expected duration of
mortgage-backed securities resulting from the decline in longer-term interest rates in
recent months and the consequent increase in prepayment risk. Small banks
primarily reported the increase in prepayment risk as the reason for increasing
securities holdings. Foreign respondents who had acquired securities also cited as an
important reason the growing trend in securitization, which presented attractive new
securities to purchase.

The value of exports fell in November following two months of strong increases.
The decrease in November was largely in capital goods with smaller declines in
most other categories of trade. These declines were partly offset by a sharp
increase in exports of automotive products, particularly to Canada. For October-
November combined, exports were 4.8 percent higher (not at annual rate) than
the third-quarter average. The sharpest increases were in automotive products to
Canada (two-thirds of which were parts), aircraft, and machinery. Healthy
increases were also recorded for exported agricultural products and services. By
area, most of the increase in October-November was to Canada, Europe, and
developing countries in Asia, particularly to China, Korea, and Taiwan. Exports
to Mexico rose, but exports to other countries in Latin America declined.
The value of imports rose slightly in November, with the sharpest increases in
computers, semiconductors, other machinery, and automotive products. The
value of imported oil declined, mostly as a result of lower oil prices. For
October-November combined, imports were 3.1 percent higher (not at annual
rate) than the third-quarter average. There were increases in most major trade
categories, with particularly strong increases recorded in automotive products
from Canada and Mexico and imported computers. Small declines were
recorded in imported non-oil industrial supplies (including the quantity of steel)
and foods.

IV-4
Quantity and price of imported oil. The quantity of imported oil declined
slightly to 11.5 million barrels per day in November, due to unusually high
inventories and a late start to the winter heating season. Preliminary Department
of Energy statistics indicate slightly higher imports in December, largely
reflecting declines in domestic production and the onset of colder weather.
The price of imported oil declined sharply in November and December after
increasing in October. The decline in price was driven by higher than expected
production by OPEC, weaker than expected consumption (especially in OECD
Asia), and surprisingly high inventories. OPEC's unwillingness to extend
production cuts also contributed to falling prices. The price of imported oil
decreased more than 17 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, a slightly
smaller rate of decline than in the third quarter. The spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) fell to $11.28 per barrel in December from $12.94 in
November. This decline largely reflected Iraq's ability to maintain unexpectedly
high exports, despite coming under military attack. Unseasonably warm weather
and high inventories also contributed to weaker prices. More recently, the spot
price rose above $12 per barrel in response to the arrival of colder winter
weather, shipping delays from Nigeria, Mexico, and Russia, and slightly lower
crude oil inventories.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of non-oil imports were
unchanged in December after edging up in October and November.
Nonetheless, non-oil import prices declined 1/2 percent at an annual rate
between the third and fourth quarters. This was the smallest rate of decline
recorded since the fourth quarter of 1996. Prices of imported "core" goods
(which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) rose 1/2 percent at an
annual rate. Prices swung to increases in the fourth quarter from declines in
previous quarters for all major import categories except computers and non-oil
industrial supplies. Prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies decreased
4-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. BLS indicated that shifts in
the exchange value of the dollar (especially against the yen and European
currencies) influenced these price movements, particularly for finished goods.
Prices of exports declined slightly in December after rising in November (the
first increase recorded since May). An increase in prices of agricultural exports
in December was more than offset by small price declines in other trade
categories. In the fourth quarter, prices of exports declined 2 percent at an
annual rate. Prices of exported "core" goods (which exclude agricultural
products, computers, and semiconductors) decreased 1 percent at an annual rate,
the smallest rate of decline since the fourth quarter of 1997; declines in prices of
exported industrial supplies were nearly offset by increases in prices of exported
automotive products and consumer goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Major changes reported for November were very large purchases of U.S.
securities by private foreigners and substantial capital outflows associated with
bank transactions. (See lines 3 and 4 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table.)
Private net purchases of U.S. securities were strong in all asset categories.
Purchases of Treasuries were especially heavy at almost $23 billion, after small
changes in September and October (line 4a). In November, Japanese residents
bought over $7 billion in Treasuries and the bulk of the rest were acquired in
international financial centers such as the United Kingdom, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, and the Caribbean. The large net purchases of U.S. corporate and
other bonds reflected heavy issuance in both categories (line 4b); of the total,
40 percent were U.S. agency bonds, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac floated
large note issues. As was the case for Treasuries, purchases in November were
concentrated in Japan ($1 billion), the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom.
Stock purchases, which revived a bit in October, were robust for the first time
since last spring (line 4c). Once again, most of the net purchases were in
international financial centers.
U.S. residents resumed net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds in November,
but the net amounts were small (line 5). The net for foreign bonds was more
than accounted for by $1.3 billion in purchases of Brazilian bonds, probably
reflecting the flotation by the government of a new series of U.S. dollar-indexed
securities.
Both U.S.- and foreign-chartered banks contributed to the large net banking
outflow in line 3. For U.S.-chartered banks in November, strong growth in
domestic bank credit was financed by a large issuance of domestic time deposits,
allowing a reversal of recent borrowing from offices abroad; foreign-chartered
banks, on the other hand, saw little growth in bank credit in November. Monthly
average data from the International Banking Data table indicate only small net
flows in December (line 1).
Foreign official holdings in the United States increased moderately in November
(line 1 of the Summary table). Increases were widely distributed, including
Israel, Korea, and Venezuela. Brazilian reserves fell substantially. Hong Kong
reserves also fell considerably, but, according to preliminary data from FRBNY,
the change was reversed in December. These latter data suggest another
moderate rise in December for official reserves held at the New York Fed.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the December FOMC meeting, the exchange value of the dollar is little
changed on balance as measured by the major currencies index while rising
3-3/4 percent versus the currencies of other important trading partners. Overall,
as measured by the broad index, the dollar has appreciated 1-3/4 percent. The
dollar appreciated against some currencies and depreciated versus others, driven
largely by developments in the respective foreign economies. As the period
ended, events in Brazil became the primary concern in international financial
markets.

On balance, the value of the dollar against the yen was little changed. On
January 11, after the dollar depreciated versus the yen to a level not seen in over
two years, the Bank of Japan intervened to weaken its currency, buying a large
amount of dollars. The dollar appreciated over 4 percent in response to the
intervention and has remained near or above its post-intervention level since.
Despite the continuing recession in Japan, higher Japanese government bond
yields and some optimism about the ongoing repair of the banking
sector--evidenced by a 10-basis-point reduction in the Japan premium since the
first of the year--may have contributed to support for the yen.

IV-10
The euro began trading on January 4, rising immediately against the dollar, but
its appreciation was short-lived. Rumors of a few settlement-system problems
during the first week were followed by data releases confirming a slowdown in
growth and the lack of inflationary pressures in many parts of the euro area,
particularly in Germany. As a result, many market participants came to believe
that the first reduction in interest rates by the European System of Central Banks
would come sooner in the year than had been anticipated. On balance, the dollar
has appreciated about 2 percent versus the euro since the December 31 fixing of
the convergence rates between the legacy currencies and the euro. As the value
of the dollar against the mark was little changed between the December FOMC
meeting and December 31, the dollar also appreciated about 2 percent versus the
mark/euro over the intermeeting period.
The dollar appreciated 2-1/2 percent with respect to sterling. The Bank of
England lowered its repo rate 25 basis points on January 7, surprising most
market analysts, who had not expected another cut so soon. In contrast, the
dollar depreciated 3-1/2 percent versus the Swedish krona, which was buoyed by
renewed public discussion of Sweden's entrance into the euro zone, and 2-1/2
percent against the Norwegian krone, as crude oil prices recovered somewhat.
The dollar also depreciated 1-1/2 percent against the Australian dollar and the
Canadian dollar.
Whatever optimism there had been in December and early January about
emerging market assets was shaken by subsequent events in Brazil. The
declaration on January 6 of a moratorium in its debt payments to the central
government by the state of Minas Gerais, a relatively minor event in its own
right, fueled fears that the Brazilian central government lacked broad political
support and would be unable to accomplish the deep reforms necessary for
sustainable fiscal and monetary stability. Faced by continuing outflows of
capital, the Brazilian central bank devalued the real 8 percent on January 13,
retaining a pegged exchange rate system. As capital flight increased, the central
bank let the real float two days later. The initial reaction was euphoric, with
stock prices soaring 33 percent in one day, retracing most of their recent losses,
and Brady bond yield spreads narrowing quickly. After a few days, however, as
the real depreciated further and capital flight continued despite rising interest
rates, pessimism returned, and the fear of contagion to other countries in Latin
America and beyond increased. Brady spreads widened rapidly but somewhat
surprisingly, Brazilian stock prices continued to rise. The central bank increased
the overnight interbank rate about 600 basis points to near 35 percent, but capital
outflows averaging about $350 million a day continued. As this Greenbook
went to press, the real had depreciated, on balance, about 36 percent from its
pre-devaluation (and December FOMC) levels, and the Brazilian Emerging
Market Bond Index (EMBI+) yield spread had widened over 300 basis points.

The perceived risk of contagion to the rest of Latin America was evidenced by
increases in the Brady bond yield spreads of the debt of other Latin American
countries (to levels still short of those reached during the Russian crisis),
widespread but moderate declines in stock prices, and increases in domestic
interest rates. As the period ended, however, the contagion seemed somewhat
contained. The Mexican peso, which had depreciated as much as 10 percent,
ended the period down only about 4 percent. Three-month cetes rates, which
initially rose about 300 basis points, subsequently declined a bit. The widely

its currency board regime from the Brazilian crisis. Argentine share prices
declined about 10 percent from pre-Brazilian devaluation levels, and Brady
spreads increased about 300 basis points. The reaction of Venezuela's financial
markets was also fairly muted.
The impact of the Brazilian crisis was felt in emerging Asia, with rumors of
possible devaluations in Hong Kong and China resurfacing in foreign exchange
markets. However China's strong reaffirmation of its commitment to the
renminbi's peg seemed to calm some fears. The strong yen continued to be seen
as a positive influence on the region's economic performance. Three-month
Hong Kong interbank rates, after a brief 100-basis-point spike following the
Brazilian devaluation, ended the period about 50 basis points higher, and the
Hang Seng index fell 10 percent over the period. Share prices in Taiwan also
declined, but stock indexes rose in other Asian markets, led by Thailand with an
8 percent increase.

Stock prices in industrial economies have been, on balance, mixed since the
December FOMC meeting. Share prices in the euro area increased the most
(from 2 percent in Spain to 7 percent in Germany), but prices in other European
countries saw slight declines. Japanese share prices increased about 1-1/2
percent, with banking sector shares outperforming the general market. Ten-year
benchmark government bond yields fell 9 to 24 basis points in the euro area and
25 basis points in the United Kingdom. In Japan, the yield on the 10-year
government bond rose another 34 basis points during the intermeeting period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data suggest that economic activity in the fourth quarter weakened in the
major foreign industrial countries. In Japan, activity likely contracted in the
fourth quarter. Although some consumption indicators have improved there
recently, private sector investment continues to act as a major drag on the
economy. In Germany, manufacturing production continues to decline, as
manufacturing orders from abroad have weakened considerably in recent
months. In addition, evidence of sluggish growth in the service sector is
consistent with a sharp slowdown in Germany. Similarly, growth was estimated
to have diminished considerably in the United Kingdom, as weakness in the
external sector appears to have spilled over to domestic demand. In contrast,
indicators in Canada suggest that the economy continued to rebound from a
strike-depressed third quarter.
Price data in foreign industrial countries continue to show little inflationary
pressure, despite a temporary uptick in prices in Japan and the United Kingdom.
Consumer price inflation remains around one percent or lower in a number of
countries, and wholesale and producer prices are down considerably from last
year's levels.
In Japan, available data suggest that economic activity continued to contract
during the fourth quarter. Industrial production declined during the fourth
quarter. Private "core" machinery orders and housing starts during October and
November were down sharply from their already weak third-quarter averages.
The unemployment rate in November rose to a new all-time high of 4.4 percent,
while the offers-to-applicants ratio dropped to 0.47, a new all-time low. New
car registrations during the fourth quarter fell to their lowest level in over a
decade, but other consumption indicators have improved somewhat in recent
months. Retail sales edged up during the fourth quarter and the household
expenditure index has increased steadily from July through November.
Four-quarter consumer price inflation turned positive during the fourth quarter,
as prices were up 0.7 percent from a year earlier due to a temporary surge in
fresh produce prices after several typhoons, but "core" inflation, which excludes
perishables, remained slightly negative. Wholesale prices during the fourth
quarter dropped a sizable 3.6 percent from a year earlier, largely reflecting sharp
declines in the import prices following the yen's appreciation during September
and October.
The Japanese trade surplus rose to $108.1 billion during 1998, up sharply from
$83 billion in 1997. In yen terms, Japan's exports to the United States and the

IV-15
euro area rose 9.2 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively, during 1998, while its
exports to Asia dropped a sizable 17.9 percent. The weakness of Japanese
domestic demand during 1998 weighed heavily on imports. Japan's imports
from the United States declined 4.1 percent from 1997; imports from the euro
area were down 5.8 percent; and imports from Asia fell 10.4 percent.

In mid-December, the Japanese government announced a ¥9 trillion package of
tax cuts to be implemented during 1999. (The government previously had
indicated that such tax cuts would amount to only ¥6 trillion.) The package
contains ¥4 trillion of permanent income tax cuts, ¥2 trillion of permanent
corporate income tax cuts, and about ¥3 trillion of so-called "policy tax cuts,"
including incentives for residential and business investment and a proposal to
abolish the securities transactions tax. In addition, the proposed FY1999 budget
appears to contain a ¥ trillion increase in "real-water" expenditure relative to
the original FY1998 budget; previous indications had suggested that spending in
the FY1999 budget would be neutral relative to its predecessor.

Limited forward-looking indicators, together with national data, confirm
weakening real economic activity across the Euro-11 countries. Although
consumer confidence edged higher from third quarter's low levels, business
confidence continued to fall. On a more positive note, the unemployment rate
for the Euro-11 countries most likely continued to decline in the fourth quarter,
and consumer price inflation through November edged lower.

German economic data point to a significant slowing in growth and are
consistent with a GDP growth rate close to zero in the fourth quarter.'
Industrial production fell sharply in November, pushing the October/November
average of the index to nearly 2 percent below its average in the third quarter.
Manufacturing orders continued to fall in November and were nearly 5 percent
1. The government has announced a preliminary 1998 year-over-year GDP growth rate of
2.8 percent. This implies a fourth-quarter growth rate of 1.6 percent at an annual rate, which
seems too optimistic in view of recent developments. Accordingly, if this yearly preliminary
estimate is not revised, there may be revisions to earlier quarters when details are announced in
March.

below their third quarter average in November, with orders from abroad
especially weak. Business confidence deteriorated further in November due to
the sharp drop in orders from abroad as well as uncertainty about the new
government's tax and fiscal policies. In addition, a survey of the service sector
indicates that service sector growth slipped for the fifth straight month in
December. The unemployment rate also rose in December, its first increase
since August 1997, even as the number of government-sponsored and subsidized
labor force positions increased.
Price data continue to show the absence of any inflationary pressure. In
December, consumer prices were up 0.5 percent, while producer prices,
wholesale prices, and import prices were down 1.7 percent, 4.5 percent, and 6.0
percent, respectively, from year-earlier levels.

Available indicators in France are mixed, but suggest that economic growth
may have slowed in the fourth quarter. On the negative side, consumption of
manufactured goods fell 0.5 percent (SA) in the fourth quarter. The index of
business confidence based on future output also continued to worsen in

December. On the positive side, however, industrial production in October and
November on average was up 0.8 percent above the third-quarter average. The

Consumer price inflation remains at 40-year lows. In December, the consumer
price index was essentially flat, which brought 1998 consumer price inflation to
0.3 percent.
In Italy, real GDP rose 2 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter, and second-
quarter growth was revised up to 2.3 percent from 1.7 percent. In the third
quarter, all components of final domestic demand and net exports were strong.
Imports declined a sizeable 8.3 percent while exports rose 1.4 percent. A large
rundown in inventories, which contributed to the decline in imports, was mainly
responsible for keeping the growth rate relatively modest.
Limited fourth-quarter monthly indicators suggest that growth may have eased
somewhat. For the fourth quarter as a whole, consumer confidence was up
slightly, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged. However, in October
and November business sentiment remained significantly below the third-quarter
level.

On December 20, the lower house of the Italian Parliament approved the 1999
draft budget, which contains $9 billion (or roughly 3/4 percent of GDP) of
deficit-cutting measures. One-third of the budgeted measures come from new
revenue and two-thirds from reduced spending.
The pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom slowed markedly in the
fourth quarter, as the preliminary estimate of real GDP showed growth of 0.7
percent (SAAR). Output of production industries was estimated to have
declined for the quarter primarily due to lower manufacturing output. Although
surveys of service sector activity indicated a slight contraction in both
November and December following a modest increase in October, service sector
output was estimated to have grown 2.4 percent. Retail sales fell in December;
for the fourth quarter on average, the volume of sales declined 0.2 percent. The
official claims-based unemployment rate remained 4.6 percent in December,
with the number of unemployed falling to the lowest level since 1980.

Producer input prices continued to decline in December. Higher seasonal food
prices contributed to an uptick in retail price inflation; the twelve-month rate of
retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) edged up to 2.6
percent in December, slightly above the inflation target. On an EU-harmonized
basis, consumer price inflation is somewhat lower, registering 1.5 percent in
December.
At its January meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of
England reduced the official repo rate 25 basis points to 6.0 percent, the fourth
consecutive easing from its most recent peak at 7.5 percent. The MPC noted
that since the December meeting, domestic data and survey evidence point to a
continuing slowdown in the U.K. economy, while risks from the international
environment "remain clearly on the downside."
Economic activity in Canada appears to be rebounding from the 1.8 percent

manufacturing orders in October and November on average were up 5.3 percent
above the third-quarter average. This is consistent with a sizeable pickup in
manufacturing activity from strike-depressed levels in the third quarter. Retail
sales in October and November on average were down 0.5 percent from the
third-quarter average. However, in the fourth quarter, consumer confidence
rebounded somewhat, and employment growth was exceptionally strong, posting
the largest quarterly increase since 1985.
Consumer price inflation remains subdued. In December, the twelve-month
change in consumer prices was 1.0 percent, the lower bound of the Bank of
Canada's inflation target.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
After months of trying to defend its currency peg and stem capital outflows with
high interest rates, Brazil was forced to abandon its fixed exchange rate policy
and allow the real to float. The change in exchange rate policy came against a
background of weakening economic activity in Brazil, with real GDP
contracting sharply in the third quarter of 1998. Real GDP was also down
sharply in Argentina in response to the high interest rates needed to defend its
currency and in Venezuela due to extremely low oil prices. All of these
countries still show substantial trade deficits despite slower import growth,
owing largely to the effects of lower commodity prices. Inflation is currently
low in Brazil, but is expected to rise sharply in response to the real's
devaluation. Elsewhere, inflation remains relatively high in Mexico and
Venezuela, but is quite low in Argentina.
Although activity in most of the Asian developing economies remains depressed,
there are signs that Korea may be beginning to recover and that the ASEAN
economies may be nearing a trough. Chinese growth has shown a modest
pickup recently, likely reflecting a surge in investment by state-owned
enterprises. Trade balances across the region have improved sharply over the
past year owing primarily to reductions in imports, while export revenues remain
weak. Inflation in these countries has generally stabilized, although in many
cases it remains higher than before the crisis began.
The economic situation in Russia continues to deteriorate. Russia has missed a
payment on its debts to London Club creditors, and its latest draft budget falls
well short of what the IMF has indicated will be necessary to win further
assistance.
On January 15, Brazil's central bank abandoned the fixed exchange rate policy
that had been the anchor of the government's 4-1/2 year old anti-inflation
program, the Plano Real, after an unsuccessful attempt two days earlier to
engineer a limited depreciation of the currency (by 8 percent) and adopt a new
peg. The January 13 decision to devalue the real resulted in the resignation of
Central Bank President Gustavo Franco, who had been a strong advocate of a
fixed exchange rate policy. Franco was replaced by Francisco (Chico) Lopes,
who had been the head of monetary policy and who had been advocating a
"more flexible" exchange rate policy. On January 18, the central bank widened
the overnight interest rate band from 29-36 percent to 25-41 percent and
announced that it will continue to let the real float but will "occasionally
intervene in the market to limit wide swings in the value of the currency."
Statements of support for the float were made by the IMF and by several foreign

IV-27
governments, but now Brazil will need to renegotiate the terms of any additional
international financial support.
In the weeks prior to the abandonment of the peg, capital flowed out of Brazil at
an alarming rate. Net capital outflows rose from roughly $2 billion in October
and November to $5 billion in December, and continued to be high in the first
half of January, reaching $1.2 billion on January 12 and $1.8 billion on
January 14. These outflows reflected the perception that the abandonment of the
peg was increasingly likely, due to the mounting toll of high interest rates on the
fiscal position of the government and on the economy, as well as the perception
that the currency was overvalued and that the current account deficit--$35 billion
in 1998, or about 4-1/2 percent of GDP--was unsustainable under current market
conditions. Moreover, in early January, markets were roiled when the governor
of Minas Gerais declared a 90-day moratorium on its debts to the federal
government and questioned whether the state had enough money to honor its
$110 million in Eurobonds maturing on February 10.
Since the currency was allowed to float, several other governors have sought to
reschedule their debts to the federal government through the intervention of the
courts. The Brazilian congress, on the other hand, has responded to the financial
turmoil more positively. On January 13, the senate overwhelmingly approved
tax increases and a few days later approved a controversial financial transactions
tax (CPMF). This bill still must be approved by the lower house, where support
for President Cardoso has been much weaker. On January 20, the lower house
approved social security taxes on public sector workers, a controversial measure
whose rejection in December fueled downward pressure on the real.
Although overnight interest rates have declined from a peak of roughly
42 percent in September, they remain very high at about 35 percent in recent
days. High interest rates are destabilizing fiscally because two-thirds of the
federal government's R$300 billion stock of securities (about one-third of 1998
GDP) is indexed to the overnight rate. High interest rates also caused economic
activity to plummet in the third quarter, and indications are that the economy
continued to weaken in the fourth quarter; industrial output declined 0.5 percent
(SA) in November and has fallen close to 7 percent since May 1998.

Recent Mexican data indicate that the economy grew at a slower pace during the
fourth quarter of 1998. While industrial production was up 3.8 percent in
November on a year-over-year basis, it slowed since the 6.1 percent growth in
the third quarter. The trade deficit widened since the last Greenbook, primarily
due to a fall-off in oil exports. Consumer prices rose 18.6 percent in 1998-
2.9 percentage points higher than in 1997. Monthly inflation in December
jumped to 2.4 percent from 1.8 percent a month earlier, reflecting the
elimination of tortilla subsidies and a cut in price controls on fuel. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 2.6 percent in December. Mexican
financial markets were initially rocked by Brazil's devaluation, but have since
recovered.
In December, the Mexican Congress approved a broad set of financial reforms,
ending a nine-month impasse between the government and Congress over a plan
to rescue the bank bailout fund, Fobaproa. Under the agreement, the Bank
Deposit Insurance Institute (IPAB) will be created along with a new set of debt-
relief programs for bank debtors. In addition, foreign investors will be allowed
to hold a majority share in Mexican commercial banks, regardless of size.
On December 31, the Mexican Congress approved the 1999 budget after a last-
minute deal between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National

IV-29
Action Party (PAN) scrapped a 15 percent tax on telephone use. President
Zedillo's administration had proposed the tax as part of measures to offset
dwindling income from oil exports. Instead of the telephone tax, the approved
budget included 14 billion pesos ($1.4 billion) in spending cuts, a 5 percent hike
in diesel fuel prices, and increased duties on imports from countries without
trade pacts with Mexico. The budget keeps to the administration's goal of a
budget deficit of 1.25 percent of GDP.

In Argentina, the impact on real activity of higher interest rates and enhanced
uncertainties resulting from the global financial turmoil continued. Real GDP
declined in the third quarter of 1998 by about 6 percent (SAAR) after having
increased by the same amount in the second quarter. Industrial production was
down nearly 7 percent in November on a year-over-year basis. Somewhat
puzzlingly, given the behavior of output, the unemployment rate declined
slightly in the fourth quarter; while there was job creation, roughly half the jobs
added since May have been part-time positions.
Inflation in Argentina remained low and the year-end annual inflation rate for
1998 was well under 1 percent. Although imports are now beginning to decline
as a result of the fall in activity, external balances continue to show significant
deficits: the cumulative trade deficit through November of last year was
$4 billion (AR), over double its value over the same period in 1997. However,
the trade deficit did narrow slightly in November over its October value.

Venezuelan economic activity continues to decline, driven by the slump in oil
prices; real GDP contracted about 5 percent in the third quarter on a year-over-
year basis, which we estimate translates into a 15 percent (SAAR) decline from
the second quarter. The inflation rate remained high at 30 percent in December,
although it was down slightly from the previous month and ended just inside
IMF targets for the year. Weak oil prices and an overvalued currency continue
to hurt external balances.
Since his landslide victory in early December elections, president-elect Hugo
Chavez has toned down most of the populist rhetoric which brought him victory
at the polls. Other than requests for a modest rescheduling of Venezuela's debt,
plans for consolidation of the bloated public sector and continued privatization
of state-owned entities, Chavez has not unveiled any major economic proposals.
Chavez has stated publicly that though he will extend a shadow arrangement
with the IMF through the upcoming year, he does not plan to ask the Fund for
financial assistance.

In Korea, recent data have provided further evidence that the steep drop of
activity of earlier last year has bottomed out and that recovery may be beginning.
Industrial production posted year-over-year gains in November and December.
Other positive indicators in November included: the plant utilization rate, which
rose from the previous month; the inventory index, which declined to its lowest
level in nearly three years; and the leading composite index, which rose for the
fifth straight month. The unemployment rate also eased in November, but at
8 percent was well above its year-earlier level of just under 3 percent, and, with
major industrial restructuring initiatives yet to be implemented, appears more
likely to rise than fall over the he remainder of this year. Inflation eased further
to a 12-month rate of 4 percent in December, held down by the strength of the
won.
As a significant step in its effort to restructure the banking sector, the
government announced that First Korea Bank, which was nationalized last year
to keep it from failing, was being sold to a U. S. consortium led by Newbridge
Capital Ltd. This is the first post-crisis acquisition of a Korean bank by foreign
interests. Newbridge is expected to inject about $1 billion into the bank to boost
its capital adequacy.

In an indication of the improved assessment by the international investor
community of Korea's financial health, Fitch IBCA, a London-based credit
rating agency, has become the first of the major credit rating agencies to restore
Korea's sovereign rating to investment grade. All major credit rating agencies
cut their ratings on Korea to junk bond status when the country plunged into a
severe foreign currency crisis in late 1997. Fitch said that the prospect of
Korea's falling into another external liquidity crisis now appeared remote.
Recent indicators for the ASEAN region show some signs that the pace of
contraction has slowed. In Indonesia, real GDP contracted 13.7 percent in 1998.
We estimate that real GDP growth in Indonesia was zero in the fourth quarter of
1998 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with a decline of 25 percent
in the third quarter. Although industrial production remains well below year-
earlier levels across the region, only in the Philippines, and to a lesser extent
Singapore, has the decline intensified in recent months.
ASEAN financial markets were relatively unaffected by events in Brazil, with
stock markets across the region giving back hardly any of their gains of recent
months. Currencies also held firm in the face of Brazil's devaluation, except for
the Indonesian rupiah which weakened significantly against a background of
mounting ethnic and religious violence in the country.

All the ASEAN countries are running trade surpluses, with balances up sharply
across the region relative to last year. The improvement has resulted mainly
from a reduction in imports rather than increases in export revenues. However,

Indonesia and Thailand recently took small steps toward reforming their
troubled banking sectors. The government in Indonesia announced that over
70 banks are eligible to enter its recapitalization program. The government will
provide 80 percent of the funds needed to recapitalize the eligible private banks,
as long as their owners or new investors supply the other 20 percent in cash. In
Thailand, the country's fourth largest bank applied to enter the government's
tier-one recapitalization program-the first Thai bank to do so.

In Hong Kong, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter rose to 5.8 percent,
well over twice its rate at the beginning of the year. In November, the price
level was below its year-earlier level. Hong Kong's merchandise trade deficit
has continued to narrow in recent months, reflecting continued weakening of

peaked in August 1998 at nearly 700 basis points at a one-year maturity,
declined steadily to only 90 basis points on January 8, the lowest spread since
October 1997. Spreads widened substantially the following week, reflecting
increasing concerns about China as well as the Brazilian devaluation. On
January 10, Chinese authorities announced that they would not give preferential
treatment to foreign creditors of the Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Company (GITIC, discussed below), raising concern about Hong

Kong banking exposure to Chinese entities; the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
has announced that exposure by local Hong Kong banks to Chinese firms
(including trust and investment companies) is about $12 billion, which staff
estimates is about 50 percent of bank capital. On January 27, spreads stood at
209 basis points. Foreign exchange reserves were $89 billion at the end of
November, up very slightly from their recent low in September.

In China, GDP rose 7.8 percent in 1998. In the fourth quarter alone, GDP rose
about 9 percent from the year-earlier period. (China generally releases its annual
growth figure in the last week of December, as it did this year; although this
early release is labeled "preliminary," the data are rarely revised.) The rise in
growth appears to reflect a surge in investment by state enterprises in the second
half of the year. Nominal state investment in 1998 was 22 percent higher than a
year earlier; most of the increase was in the second half, since investment rose
only 11 percent in the first half.
China's trade surplus was slightly higher in 1998 than 1997. However, the
surplus has fallen in recent months, reflecting weakening exports. The value of
exports in the fourth quarter fell 7 percent from its year-earlier level, while the
value of imports fell 5 percent. Foreign direct investment inflows were
$45.5 billion in 1998, almost unchanged from a year earlier. Total reserves less
gold were $149 billion at the end of 1998, up about $6 billion from the end of
1997.
In early January, Chinese authorities announced that they plan to put GITIC into
bankruptcy. Authorities closed GITIC in October without any clear explanation
of how its outstanding liabilities (currently reported at $4.4 billion, compared
with assets of $2.6 billion) would be treated. The announcement generally
disappointed foreign creditors, who had hoped for preferential treatment for
foreign banks. The announcement also indicated that even foreign debt

IV-36
officially registered with the central government would not necessarily be
honored, despite the assumption of many creditors to the contrary. Given the
outcome, foreign lenders are likely to remain wary about lending to Chinese
non-bank financial institutions. Nevertheless, the announcement appears to
signal that Chinese authorities are serious about trying to crack down on
financial "irregularities."

In Taiwan, industrial production growth slowed in the fourth quarter. Taiwan's
trade balance remained in surplus in 1998, although it was down slightly from
its 1997 surplus. The value of exports fell 9 percent from a year-earlier, while
the value of imports fell 8 percent. Inflation moderated somewhat in December,
following a sharp rise in October and November. Foreign exchange reserves
rose above $90 billion in December, up about $7 billion for the year and the
highest level since July 1997. Taiwan's stock market remained relatively stable
in late 1998 and early 1999, but this stability appears to reflect continuing
intervention by the government's stock stabilization fund.
The Russian economy remains in turmoil. Real GDP fell sharply in September,
and industrial output was down almost 7 percent year-over-year in December.
So far this year, the ruble has fallen by about 9 percent relative to the dollar and
is down roughly 75 percent since mid-August. The sharp increase in the cost of
imports since August has caused inflation to soar, from 6 percent on a twelve-
month basis in July to over 80 percent in December.
The current version of Russia's 1999 budget, recently passed in its second of
four readings, aims to trim the deficit from 5 1/2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 2 1/2
percent this year, with a primary (non-interest) surplus of 1 3/4 percent. This plan
has so far failed to win favor with the IMF, which has made known that it would
like to see a primary surplus of 3-4 percent of GDP next year. Several

assumptions underlying the budget seem overly optimistic, including an annual
inflation rate of 30 percent and an exchange rate of 21.5 rubles per dollar.
Furthermore, the budget assumes the resumption of IMF and World Bank
lending as well as the successful "re-rescheduling" of about $7 billion in Soviet-
era debt. The IMF continues to stress that further assistance will not be
forthcoming without a coherent budget and some signs that it is being
implemented.
The government also continues to negotiate with foreign creditors on
rescheduling of its Soviet-era external debt, while maintaining that it will meet
in full all obligations of the Russian Federation, issued since 1991. In
December, Russia failed to make payment on $360 million in interest owed to
the London Club. The government had offered to restructure the debt in new
paper, but failed to raise the 95 percent agreement from creditors necessary to
approve the deal. Negotiations on restructuring Russia's $40 billion debt to the
Paris Club will not begin until after the government's economic plan wins
approval from the IMF.
