DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economic expansion continues to exhibit almost startling momentum.
Consumer spending soared in the first two months of 1999--boosted by a
remarkable level of motor vehicle sales--and housing starts rose to still higher
levels. The industrial sector continued to struggle, owing in large measure to
problems in international trade, but job gains elsewhere in the economy were
sizable and the unemployment rate remained low. To round out the good
news, inflation remained subdued through February.
Labor Market Developments
Strength in the demand for labor continued unabated in early 1999. The
monthly increases in private nonfarm payroll employment averaged 216,000
in January and February, a shade above the pace of job growth in 1998.
The recent employment gains have been driven disproportionately by activity
in the construction and retail trade industries. Boosted by the robust housing
market, construction employment rose 43,000 per month on average. In the
retail industry, payrolls were up a substantial 80,000 per month; especially
notable, general merchandisers and miscellaneous retail establishments
recorded less-than-seasonal layoffs, and stores selling furniture and building
materials hired actively.
Elsewhere, the picture was mixed: Employment in business services rose
briskly over the first two months of the year and, in February, health services
posted the first large gain since last summer; however, some other industries
in services saw declines. Employment gains in FIRE were robust in January
but slowed in February.
In manufacturing, firms have shed almost 70,000 jobs so far in 1999.
Accounting for half of this decline were the apparel, textile, machinery, and
aircraft industries--all of them greatly exposed to foreign demand or
competition.
With strong overall growth in payrolls and a pop-up in the average
workweek, the index of aggregate hours of private production or
nonsupervisory workers rose 0.6 percent in February after having held steady
in January. The level of aggregate hours in February was 0.9 percent above
that in the fourth quarter, pointing to another solid increase in hours in the
first quarter.
Data from the household survey continue to indicate a very tight labor
market. The unemployment rate was little changed, on net, over the first two
months of the year. Since last spring, the unemployment rate has fluctuated

in a narrow 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent range.1 In addition, the labor force
participation rate only edged down a tenth last month from the record high of
67.4 percent reached in January. The ready availability of jobs appears to be
raising participation over a broad spectrum of demographic groups and, not
surprisingly, the percentage of the population aged 16 to 64 who want jobs
but are not in the labor force continues to hold at very low levels.
Other indicators that have become available since the last Greenbook confirm
the picture of strong labor demand and a limited supply of potential new
workers. Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved down still further,
and the vacancy rate, as proxied by the Conference Board's Help Wanted
Index, climbed in January to near the all-time high reached last March.
Firms' perceptions of hiring strength as measured by the National Federation
of Independent Businesses' survey of small firms, the Manpower survey, and
the BNA survey remain below levels reached last year but still indicate
considerable strength. According to the Conference Board's survey,
individuals currently perceive an abundance of jobs, and their expectations of
future employment opportunities continue to be optimistic; the Michigan SRC
and the Conference Board's measures of expected labor market conditions
have moved up, on balance, since January, although they remain below the
very high levels observed early last year.
In addition to the big gains in employment, the end of 1998 saw a surge in
productivity. Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is now reported
to have jumped at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter.2 Over
the four quarters ended in 1998:Q4, productivity in the nonfarm business
sector rose 2.7 percent after solid increases in the prior two years. The
resurgence in productivity growth in recent years has been impressive: On a
consistently measured basis, average productivity rose 2.0 percent per year
from 1995 to 1998, 1.2 percent from 1990 to 1995, and 1.3 percent from
1. Some private analysts have suggested that the amount of upward wage pressure
generated by the recently low unemployment rates is lessened by the relatively high median
duration of unemployment spells. While plausible in principle, such an offset is likely to be
small. The unemployment rate combines the incidence and duration of unemployment into a
single summary measure. In practice, we have found that measures of unemployment
duration do not add significant information about wage pressures beyond that provided by the
unemployment rate. In addition, comparisons over time using the duration measure alone are
complicated by the CPS redesign in 1994 that significantly increased average measured
durations.
2. We are expecting a 1/4 percentage point (annual rate) downward revision to fourth-
quarter productivity growth because of the upward revision to December aggregate production
worker hours that was reported in the February employment report.

1979 to 1990.3 Of course, the recent surge in productivity has coincided with
very robust (and likely partly unanticipated) output growth and probably
reflects, in part, a lag in hiring in a tight labor market rather than permanent,
structural improvements in operating efficiency--that is, a mix of "cycle" and
improved "trend."
Industrial Production
Industrial production has grown only slightly since December, with no change
in January and a rise of just 0.2 percent in February. Mining activity in
January was depressed by further weakness in gas and oil extraction, while
the return of milder weather restrained output of utilities in February.4 In
manufacturing, production expanded modestly in both months, pushed up by
gains in most high-tech industries (defined as computers, communications
equipment, and semiconductors). In the transportation sector (motor vehicles
and aircraft), output declined over January and February. In other sectors,
production remained flat, on net, over the first two months of 1999.
Output of motor vehicles and parts has remained near the fourth-quarter's
extremely elevated post-strike levels. First-quarter production of motor
vehicles is expected to come in at around 12.7 million units (annual rate):
Losses due to storm-related closings in the Midwest in January and to an
explosion at Ford's Rouge facilities in February are being offset by what
appears to be a substantial overbuild relative to schedules in March. The
elevated production levels are likely to continue for a time because recent
sales surprises have left inventories of some models too lean. Elsewhere in
the transportation sector, the output of aircraft and parts declined again in
February as Boeing continues to adjust production to the scheduled decline in
aircraft completions.
The output of high-tech industries has increased substantially so far this year.
Computer production remained robust through February, and the output of
semiconductors and related electronic components grew sharply. Production
of communications equipment was soft, on balance, in January and February,
but with orders running above shipments, the weakness may only be
temporary.
Manufacturing production outside the transportation and high-tech industries
changed little, on net, in January and February with strength in business
equipment, durable consumer goods, and construction supplies balanced by
3. The consistently measured series corrects for the technical changes to the CPI that
affect the chain price index for the nonfarm business sector.
4. Cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected to boost utilities generation significantly
in March.

weakness in nondurable consumer goods and nondurable materials. A large
part of the strength in business equipment was due to a rebound in farm
machinery and service industry machinery. Partially offsetting this was
reduced demand for oil and gas field machinery related to the decline in
extraction activity. And, the output of construction machinery has decreased
significantly--though the level remains elevated.
Possibly reflecting spillovers from the housing sector, the output of durable
consumer goods was boosted over the first two months of the year by large
increases in the production of lawn and garden equipment and continuing
strength in household appliances. In another housing-related industry, the
production of manufactured construction supplies rose, on net, in January and
February.
Elsewhere, inventory overhangs in a few sectors (notably petroleum,
chemicals, textiles, metals, and industrial machinery) continued to hold down
production. In some of these industries, demand from abroad deteriorated at
the end of 1997, and unwanted inventories had accumulated by mid-1998. In
the aggregate, however, the rise in the manufacturing inventory-shipments
ratio has been small.
Looking ahead, most anecdotal evidence and statistical indicators suggest a
firming of orders for manufacturing goods. The Beige Book reported that
businesses in a number of districts are cautiously optimistic about 1999 and
expect orders and output to increase in the next six months. Board staff
contacts report stronger demand for steel, appliances, and several types of
machinery, but producers of chemicals still complain of excess capacity, weak
orders, and soft prices. Also, although the staff series of real adjusted durable
goods orders--based on data from the Census Bureau--declined in February,
the average over the first two months of the year was 2-1/4 percent above the
fourth-quarter reading. In addition, the National Association of Purchasing
Managers' survey reported a substantial upswing in the new orders index in
January and February, at least in part owing to a strengthening in new export
orders.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Consumer spending surged in the early months of the year and is headed
toward another hefty advance in this quarter. Disposable personal income
increased rapidly, and higher equity prices boosted net worth further.
Motor vehicles. The average pace of motor vehicle sales in January and
February was close to the lofty 16-1/4 million unit (annual rate) level of the
fourth quarter. Industry sources indicate that sales this month have remained
exceptionally strong.

The sustained high demand has mainly reflected favorable consumer
fundamentals--robust income, wealth, and confidence. But these pluses have
been reinforced by attractive pricing, including still-considerable incentives.
In particular, GM sweetened general incentives in the middle of February and
offered a special discount of $1,000 to employees, their relatives, and retirees
for purchases made during the last few days of the month.
The preliminary reading of the Michigan survey's index of car-buying
conditions rebounded in March, matching the recent peak in January. The
reasons for consumers' upbeat views were numerous, with particularly
favorable readings regarding prices, finance rates, and the strength of the
economy.
Other consumption and personal income. In February, nominal sales in the
retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and
building material and supply stores, increased 0.5 percent after an upward-
revised gain of 1.1 percent in January.5 Taking the two months together,
gains in retail sales were widespread and were particularly strong at general
merchandise and apparel stores. Based on the retail sales and consumer price
data, we estimate that average real spending on goods excluding motor
vehicles in January and February was 1.9 percent (not an annual rate) above
the fourth-quarter level.
Published data on service expenditures are available only through January,
when real PCE for services jumped 0.6 percent. Outlays were boosted by a
pickup in energy services after the unseasonably warm weather in December.
Among non-energy services in January, increases were reported in almost all
major components. In particular, a surge in stock market volume at the turn
of the year helped to push brokerage services up more than 11 percent in
January (not at an annual rate), and outlays for recreational services jumped
1.5 percent.
In January, real disposable personal income increased 0.5 percent. The
relatively large gain reflected not only strength in private wages and salaries
but also the net effects of a number of special factors--including federal pay

5. The increase in nominal retail control in January had been reported at 0.3 percent in
the advance release. The revision to January retail control is the largest since the Census
Bureau completed the switch to a new sampling procedure with the release of November 1997
data; indeed, the January revision was almost three times the standard deviation of revisions
since the new sampling procedures were implemented. Nevertheless, the standard deviation of
revisions under the new methodology remains about half of what it was under the previous
survey design.

adjustments to tax withholding schedules and the EITC. These positive
factors were partially offset by higher personal contributions for social
insurance (subtracted from personal income), which owed to an increase in
the taxable wage base for social security. The BEA does not seasonally
adjust these items, leading to a discontinuity in seasonally adjusted income
growth each January. In addition, personal tax payments were reduced by the
child tax credit and the education expenditures tax credit, but their effects
were roughly counterbalanced by other provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act
of 1997, including changes in safe harbor provisions for the payment of
estimated taxes.
More generally, income has been on a solid uptrend. Over the twelve months
ended January, real DPI increased 3.6 percent--about 1/2 percentage point
faster than during the same period a year earlier. In February, an increase in
production worker hours combined with a small uptick in wages suggests
another significant gain in income.
In addition to the impetus to spending from strong income growth, demand
has been boosted by the soaring wealth of households. In the fourth quarter,
the resurgent stock market lifted the ratio of household net worth to income
to a new high--more than reversing the third-quarter decline--and it appears to
have held close to this level in the first quarter. With such sharp gains in
household net worth, individuals have had little reason to boost their savings
out of current income. In January, the saving rate was 0.1 percent, unchanged
from the fourth-quarter average.
Consumer sentiment remains positive in general. Although the preliminary
March reading on consumer sentiment from the Michigan survey ticked down,
this index has moved up, on balance, since January; it remains in the high
range that has prevailed over the past two years. Households were extremely
upbeat about current conditions in early March, although their expectations
regarding personal finances and the economic outlook softened a little.
Housing Markets
Housing markets remained very robust in the first quarter, with total housing
starts in January and February averaging 1.8 million units (annual rate).
Single-family starts reached 1.41 million units (annual rate) in February, the
highest level in twenty years. The recent strength in housing starts is largely
attributable to the robust economy and favorable financial conditions.
Moreover, good weather this winter likely provided an additional boost by
making it easier for builders to address demand backlogs by extending the
construction season in some regions.

Home sales also have been very strong--though there are hints of a peaking.
Existing home sales reached a record high in January; because most of these
transactions are recorded at closing, this measure tends to be a bit of a
lagging indicator of demand. New home sales decreased in January for the
second consecutive month--though the January figure still was the third
highest observation in the 36-year history of the series.
Other indicators also provide some hints that demand is topping out. Judging
from the decline registered by the National Association of Home Builders'
monthly survey of builders, sales of new homes may have moderated in early
March. In addition, the MBA index of applications for mortgages to finance
home purchases has, on net, moved down considerably from the high reached
last October. The Michigan survey series on perceived homebuying
conditions, which set a record high last December, declined noticeably in
early March, although it remains at a highly favorable level by historical
standards.
Housing prices have continued to rise appreciably faster than overall inflation.
The median price of new homes was up 6 percent in January from a year
earlier, a rate that is in the middle of the range seen over the past year.
However, the year-over-year change in the constant-quality price of new
homes, which adjusts for changes in house size and other amenities as well as
shifts in the geographic composition of sales, was up just 3.6 percent in the
fourth quarter, about the same as a year ago. For existing homes, the median
price rose 4-1/2 percent from a year earlier in January, at the lower end of the
range seen in the past year. The repeat-sales index of existing home prices
increased 4-3/4 percent over the four quarters of last year.
Business Fixed Investment
After having soared in the fourth quarter, the pace of real business fixed
investment appears to have decelerated to a more moderate rate of advance.
In particular, the rate of increase of expenditures on durable equipment
appears to be slowing after a strong fourth quarter, and spending on
nonresidential structures shows signs of flattening.
Producers' durable equipment. Producers' durable equipment appears to be
advancing considerably this quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth
quarter. Although the incoming data point to a sizable gain in real business
outlays on computers, the increase looks to be smaller than last quarter.
Also, Boeing's reported delivery schedule suggests that aircraft shipments to
domestic carriers will decelerate, on balance, in the first quarter. Moreover,
the growth of business spending on motor vehicles and communications
equipment is apparently slowing from the substantial pace of the fourth
quarter, and outlays for other equipment appear lackluster.

Business outlays for motor vehicles likely will rise much less this quarter than
last. Fleet sales of autos and trucks dropped back in January and February to
more normal levels from the post-strike pace of the fourth quarter. In
addition, leases to consumers, which also rebounded sharply last quarter, are
expected to show a smaller increase in the current quarter. However, sales of
medium and heavy trucks moved further into uncharted territory in February
as sales surged to about 660,000 units at an annual rate--40 percent higher
than a year ago. Although up in February, net new orders for trucks have
eased, on balance, since the middle of last year. However much of this near-
term weakness has been in demand from Mexico and, to a lesser extent,
Canada, while domestic demand has remained quite strong. Even with the
recent softening in orders, backlogs remain extraordinarily high, and the near-
term outlook for sales is still favorable.
Gains in real expenditures on office and computing equipment appear to be
running below the sizable increase registered last quarter. Nominal shipments
of computers rose 3-1/4 percent in February, despite reports of soft demand
for personal computers. Earlier in the year, PC makers slashed prices at the
first sign of weakness to avoid a repeat of last year's costly inventory
problems. Moreover, the introduction at the very end of February of
computers using Pentium III microprocessors has led to further price
reductions on models with older chips.
A moderate increase in real outlays for communications equipment seems to
be under way this quarter. Although nominal shipments in February stood
only 1 percent above their fourth-quarter level, the level of orders last month
was up considerably from the fourth-quarter average, suggesting continued
strength going forward. Two strong forces have affected (and will continue
to affect) the domestic market for communications equipment. In late
January, the Supreme Court ruled that the FCC's interpretation of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 is valid and that local telephone companies
must begin leasing their equipment, or "elements," to would-be market
entrants at competitive prices. The resolution of the appeals process in favor
of increased competition should spur further spending on communications
equipment going forward. In addition, most large telecommunications
companies are moving toward communications networks that are packet-
switched (that is, transmitted using the same technology as that of the
Internet) rather than circuit-switched (for example, most current voice
networks). The need for a smooth transition has contributed to the rash of
mergers of traditional telephone companies (which account for 90 percent of
telecom revenue) with smaller, more technologically advanced companies.
These newly formed entities have easy access to financial resources and are
positioned to continue to spend quite lavishly on their emerging networks.

Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, nominal shipments rose
1/2 percent in February but remained below the fourth-quarter average due to
the 5 percent drop in January. Across the two months, the weakness in
shipments is fairly widespread and is particularly noticeable within the
industrial machinery category.
Nonresidential structures. Spending on nonresidential construction got off
to a slow start in January, with nominal outlays for private nonresidential
buildings declining 1.1 percent. Industrial construction continued to fall,
consistent with the relatively low rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing
industries. Non-office commercial building turned down after having risen at
an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent last quarter, and institutional construction also
declined. However, the uptrend in the construction of office buildings--where
outlays rose considerably in 1998--continued into January, and the building of
lodging facilities increased. Contracts for private nonresidential construction,
a precursor of construction spending, declined 21 percent over the first two
months of the year, owing to continued weakness in industrial building and a
decline in contracts for construction of stores and warehouses. Overall,
contracts have been trending down for more than a year, depressed by the
weakness in industrial buildings.
Business Inventories
The book-value of business inventories excluding motor vehicles was little
changed in January, down from the $6.3 billion pace posted in the fourth
quarter of 1998. Although readings across industries are mixed, business
inventories in the aggregate appear to be at comfortable levels.
Manufacturers' inventories dropped in January as producers of aircraft and
parts reduced stocks for the third consecutive month. Excluding aircraft,
inventories fell $1.8 billion in January. Inventories accumulated at producers
of food and chemicals. Also, stocks of industrial machinery rose slightly,
despite a decline in inventories held by manufacturers of computers and
peripheral parts. Producers of electronic and other electrical equipment,
especially communication equipment, drew down stocks.
Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles were essentially unchanged in
January. Large declines occurred at distributors of apparel, farm products,
and professional and commercial equipment, a grouping which includes office
and computing equipment. In contrast, machinery wholesalers found
themselves with sharply higher holdings, raising an already high inventory-
sales ratio. And in the aggregate, wholesale inventory-sales ratios (excluding
motor vehicles) have been elevated since last summer.

In both the manufacturing and wholesale sectors, inventory-sales ratios have
run up in the machinery (excluding high tech), metals, and chemicals
components. Although production has declined sharply in these sectors, the
reductions have not kept pace with falling shipments; some of the weakness
undoubtedly reflects sluggish demand from abroad. Compared with
manufacturing, the overhangs are more pronounced in the wholesale trade
sector--where a flood of imports most likely has contributed to stockbuilding--
and thus show through more dramatically in the aggregate wholesale
inventory-sales ratio. Indeed, excluding motor vehicles, machinery, metals,
and chemicals, wholesale inventory-sales ratios have retraced much of last
summer's rise.
Notable developments also have occurred in high-tech categories, where
inventory-sales ratios have fallen appreciably since early 1998.6 The decline
in inventories relative to sales at high-tech businesses may reflect the large
incentives to increase turnover in industries characterized by rapidly changing
technology and falling prices. To this end, PC computer makers have moved
increasingly toward building to order and selling directly to households and
businesses.
In retail trade, which is less affected by weak demand from the external
sector, inventories seem in good shape. Stocks at non-auto retailers rose at an
annual rate of $24 billion in January, reflecting increases in nearly every
major category. However, this high level of stockbuilding took place against
the backdrop of a huge increase in retail sales. Spending was particularly
strong at general merchandisers and apparel outlets, and inventory-sales ratios
in these two categories fell sharply further. The stock-to-sales ratio also
remained low in the furniture and home furnishings sector, which includes
consumer electronic and computer stores among many other types of
establishments. Overall, the inventory-sales ratio at non-auto retailers in
January remained at 1.38 for the third consecutive month, the lowest ratio of
this expansion.
Government Sector
According to Monthly Treasury Statements, the federal budget surplus over
the twelve months ended February, adjusted for payment timing shifts and
excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was $76 billion.
This figure compares with a $5 billion deficit in the comparable year-earlier
period. As expected, refunds in January and February were substantially
6. In manufacturing, the high-technology sector depicted on the chart includes computer
and office equipment, communications equipment, and electronic components
(semiconductors); the high-tech wholesalers are the distributors of professional and
commercial equipment.

higher than over the same period last year, reflecting the effects of the child
tax credit enacted in 1997 and the ongoing shift toward earlier filing. Even
excluding refund payments, the increase in tax revenues appears to be
moderating from the spectacular pace of the past few years. At the same
time, outlays are still increasing slowly. Defense spending over the year
ended February was about the same in nominal terms as over the previous
year, and Medicare expenditures have remained subdued. In addition, net
interest expenditures continued to fall over the past twelve months.
Based in part on the data in the Monthly Treasury Statements, it appears
likely that real federal consumption and investment expenditures will decline
somewhat in the first quarter. The decrease likely will be concentrated in the
defense area.
On February 1, President Clinton submitted his fiscal 2000 budget to the
Congress. According to the Administration, if current policies were to remain
in place, the unified budget would show a surplus of $117 billion in fiscal
2000 and a cumulative total of $828 billion between fiscal 2000 and 2004.
The Administration's projections also suggest that, as a percent of GDP, the
baseline surplus would rise from a bit less than 1 percent this year to
3-1/2 percent in fiscal 2014.
The President's plan contains a number of spending and revenue initiatives
and a sizable transfer of monies from the on-budget accounts to the social
security trust fund. Over the 2000-04 period, the Administration's proposals
would reduce the cumulative surplus by $259 billion.
The CBO's preliminary analysis of the President's budget, which was released
on March 3, shows unified surpluses (excluding proposals contingent on
social security reform) through fiscal 2004 that are slightly higher than the
OMB's. The CBO's more favorable outlook for the budget under current
policies more than accounts for the difference.7 The CBO has edged up its
own projection for the baseline surplus since January, mainly because of
incoming data reporting low outlays for Medicare. The CBO's baseline
projection now shows baseline surpluses of $111 billion in fiscal 1999 and
$133 billion in fiscal 2000.
7. The CBO's analysis includes its own estimates of the budgetary effects of the
President's "basic" policy proposals--that is, those that are not contingent on social security
reform. Because the Administration provided little detail on the proposals that are contingent
on social security reform (including additional discretionary spending and funding for
Universal Savings Accounts), the CBO simply assumes the amounts specified in the budget.

Spending by state and local governments appears to have accelerated in early
1999. In particular, real construction outlays--which are volatile on a monthly
basis--surged in January to a level about 8 percent above the average for the
fourth quarter. The increase in construction outlays was concentrated in the
highway and bridges category. More generally, hiring by state and local
governments also appears to have picked up of late: On average, employment
rose 34,000 per month between December and February, compared with an
increase of 27,000 per month, on average, over 1998 as a whole.
Prices
The good news continues on the inflation front: Both the overall and core
indexes increased just 0.1 percent per month in January and February. Over
the past twelve months, the overall index was up just 1.6 percent. Excluding
food and energy, the CPI increased 2.1 percent over the year ended in
February, down 0.2 percentage point from the previous twelve months.
However, measured on a consistent basis, there was no deceleration in core
CPI.8 Of course, the late-year surge in tobacco prices pushed up the core
index; excluding those increases as well, core prices would have decelerated
more last year on a published basis, and they would also have decelerated on
a consistently measured basis.
With the release of the January CPI data, the BLS implemented a number of
additional technical changes. A geometric-mean weighting formula was
introduced to aggregate individual price quotes at the finest level of published
data. BLS estimates that, going forward, the adoption of geometric weighting
in categories that make up about 60 percent of the index will reduce the
annual increase in the CPI for all of 1999 about 0.2 percentage point. Other
changes include a new housing sample; a new estimation method for owners'
equivalent rent; hedonic adjustment of television prices; and the treatment of
costs associated with mandated pollution control measures as price increases
rather than quality improvements.
Turning to the details, the CPI for food edged up 0.1 percent in February
following January's 0.5 percent increase. Over the twelve months ended in
February, retail food prices increased 2.4 percent, up 1/2 percentage point
from the previous twelve months. The acceleration in retail grocery prices
this past year seems to largely reflect a swing in prices received by farmers
for livestock products; these prices fell about 4 percent over the twelve
8. The technical changes introduced in January 1998--updating the base period and adding
hedonics for computer prices--and those introduced in January of this year held down the
change in the core CPI over the twelve months ended February of this year by about
1/4 percentage point compared with the increase over the twelve months ended in February
1998.

months ended in February 1998 but have risen about 1 percent this past year,
mainly because of higher dairy prices. That turnabout for livestock prices
resulted in a slower rate of decline this past year in the farm portion of total
value added for domestically produced foods--even though crop prices fell
much faster than in the previous year. Meanwhile, the farm-to-retail margin,
which now accounts for almost 80 percent of total value added in the food
industry, continued to expand this past year, at a pace that easily offset the
further decline in the overall farm contribution to retail grocery prices.
Energy prices were flat in February after having edged down 0.2 percent in
January. An increase in electricity prices in February offset further declines
in gasoline and heating oil prices. Looking ahead, recent data from the
Lundberg survey suggest that retail prices of gasoline have moved up from
February's bargain basement levels. Higher crude costs likely will continue
putting upward pressure on gasoline prices. (See the International
Developments section for an update on recent developments in oil markets.)
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy dropped sharply in
February after having been flat in January. Prices of both durable and
nondurable goods fell last month. Over the twelve months ended February,
commodity prices excluding food and energy rose 0.7 percent, up from the
0.4 percent rate in the previous twelve months. The 26 percent surge in the
index for tobacco from November to January more than explains this recent
acceleration: Excluding tobacco (as well as food and energy), commodity
prices in the CPI dropped 0.6 percent in the last year.
Over the twelve months ended in February, prices of services other than
energy rose 2.8 percent, down from the 3.1 percent increase in the
comparable period ended February 1998. The index for non-energy services
rose 0.2 percent in February for the third consecutive month. Following the
unusually small rise of 0.1 percent in January, the index for owners'
equivalent rent moved up 0.3 percent in February; last month's increase was
just about in line with the average monthly increases in each of the previous
two years.
The latest data on capital equipment prices suggest continued softness: The
producer price index for capital equipment rose 0.1 percent in February
following a 0.1 percent decrease in January. Over the twelve months ended
in February, capital equipment prices were about unchanged after having
fallen 0.7 percent in the previous twelve-month period. In the first two
months of this quarter, the PPI for computers fell at an annual rate of
27 percent, somewhat faster than the 22 percent pace posted in the fourth
quarter.

The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy declined
0.2 percent in February, about the same as the monthly declines since
November. In contrast, the PPI for crude materials other than food and
energy rose 1.1 percent in February, the first sizable monthly increase in
about a year and a half. However, prices of many raw materials have turned
down, on balance, since price data for the PPI were collected in mid-
February. The CRB index of spot industrial prices has dropped about
2-1/2 percent since mid-February. On the other hand, the price of crude oil--
which is not included in the CRB spot index--has moved up sharply in recent
weeks.
After having edged lower in the second half of last year, the median measure
of one-year-ahead-inflation expectations in the Michigan Survey has moved
back up to 2.6 percent in the first quarter, following readings of 2.4 percent in
each of the previous two quarters. The survey respondents' views on longer-
term inflation expectations have been more stable recently, with the median
Michigan five- to ten-year expectations unchanged in the first quarter at
2.8 percent. Also, the ten-year expectations of the Professional Forecasters
dropped to 2.3 percent.
Labor Costs
Average hourly earnings of private production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.1 percent in February after having increased 0.4 percent in January. Over
the twelve months ended in February, average hourly earnings increased
3.6 percent, off noticeably from the mid-1998 peak in this series of
4.4 percent. Outside of the services industry, the recent deceleration in
average hourly earnings has been widespread.
Looking back to the fourth quarter, compensation per hour in the nonfarm
business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter
and 4.0 percent for the year as a whole. The ECI increased somewhat less
during 1998, which is not surprising given the greater cyclical sensitivity of
compensation per hour. Unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector
dropped 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter--reflecting the surge in productivity--
and decelerated considerably over the past year.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Longer-term Treasury rates backed up significantly in the first weeks of the
intermeeting period, with economic data running on the strong side of market
expectations and Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony
suggesting to many that, in the circumstances, monetary policymakers might
be modestly inclined toward tightening. Rates have retraced some of that rise
this month, as data releases have conveyed favorable inflation news and
subsequent statements by Fed officials gave the impression that they saw risks
as more balanced. On net, Treasury coupon yields have risen 30 to 40 basis
points from the February FOMC meeting. With yields on Treasury indexed
debt up about 15 basis points, real rates apparently made up a good bit of the
nominal rate rise.
Some of the backup in nominal Treasury rates likely reflects a further
unwinding of last fall's safety and liquidity concerns. Evidence of this
recovery is apparent in the fact that yields on private debt securities have
risen generally less than those on comparable Treasuries. Spreads of
commercial paper yields over comparable-maturity Treasury repo rates for
both high-tier and lower-tier issuers have returned to levels observed before
the market disruptions last fall, and spreads over Treasuries on relatively
illiquid asset-backed securities and municipal bonds have retraced a good
portion of their rise as well. Still, spreads on lower-rated corporate bonds and
commercial mortgage-backed securities, while down significantly from their
October peaks, remain substantially above mid-1998 levels. Some spreads for
on-the-run/off-the-run Treasury securities have also stayed wide.
In equity markets, many large cap stock indexes hit record highs in the period
following the last FOMC meeting. Good news on the pace of economic
activity and corporate profits more than offset the effects on share valuations
of rising bond yields. After the Dow touched 10,000 last week, however, the
market focus seemed to shift to the negatives and uncertainties in the picture,
and prices slipped back, leaving all major indexes (except the DJIA) at or
below their February 2 levels. Gross issuance of new shares has been strong,
including some IPOs, but retirements through mergers and buybacks continue
to dominate.
Business and household borrowing has continued at a hefty pace overall.
Corporate bond issuance was brisk in February and March, and commercial
paper outstanding rebounded sharply from its fourth-quarter decline. Some of
the commercial paper proceeds evidently were used to repay bank loans,
which have declined since the beginning of the year. Consumer credit surged
at a double-digit rate in January, while mortgage debt growth for the quarter
as a whole seems likely to ease off its robust 11 percent pace in the fourth
quarter. With regard to government financing, municipal bond issuance has

moderated somewhat from last year's near-record rate, and continued
improvements in budget prospects have led the Treasury to trim several bill
and note auction sizes this quarter.
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates apparently has slowed sharply this
month, perhaps owing in part to reduced demands for safe and liquid
instruments as well as lessened overall funding needs by banks. But the
robust rate of recent months implies that through February, M2 has risen at a
7-1/2 percent annual rate and M3 at a 9 percent rate, from their respective
fourth-quarter levels. Bank credit ran off in both January and February after
its fourth-quarter bulge, and partial data suggest that it was weak again in
March.
Business Finance
Although spreads remain elevated for all but the top-rated firms, interest rate
levels have been attractive enough to encourage heavy issuance of corporate
bonds this quarter. More than half of the funds raised in recent weeks have
been earmarked for paying down debt. The speculative-grade side of the
market demonstrated some breadth in February, with offerings spread among
a number of small issues. However, in March large telecom firms once again
dominated the market, as Charter Communications placed a $3 billion
offering, the third largest junk-rated issue in history. On the whole, the
speculative-grade market still appears somewhat wary of offerings from
smaller and lesser-known firms.
Outstanding commercial paper grew quite rapidly in the intermeeting period,
boosted in March by AT&T's $8 billion paper issuance to complete its
acquisition of the cable television firm TCI. This paper is expected to be
paid down soon with proceeds from a record $8 billion bond offering by
AT&T in late March.
Merger activity has continued at a hefty pace. While the largest deals have
been among firms in the telecommunications sector, megamergers have been
completed in many industries. Most of the deals have been friendly and
structured as pure stock swaps, with few requiring cash financing from
domestic sources; consequently, despite the high dollar-value of deals
completed so far this year, the cash needs of U.S. acquirers have been well
below those of last year. Looking ahead, the list of deals pending completion
suggests that merger-related borrowing demands by domestic companies
likely will remain moderate.
Notwithstanding the continued robust pace of economic expansion, there
appears to have been some slippage in corporate credit quality since year-end.
Most notably, the default rate on junk bonds has moved up in recent months,

as has the business failure rate--a measure of financial distress that covers
the entire business sector. That junk bond spreads remain quite elevated
likely reflects, at least in part, market perceptions of higher credit risk.
Indeed, a simple forecasting model predicts that rising debt-to-asset ratios and
higher asset volatility will be mirrored in a further increase in the junk bond
default rate in coming months.' In addition, the number of Moody's
downgrades of nonfinancial firms exceeded upgrades in January and February
by more than two to one, leading to a net downgrade of $39 billion.
However, several of the firms downgraded are oil producers, and if the recent
rebound in oil prices persists, these lower ratings may be short lived. On the
financial side, Moody's upgraded $35 billion of debt outstanding at Chrysler's
financial subsidiary after its parent merged with Daimler. Debt placed on
watch for future rating actions suggests a rough balance between upgrades
and downgrades.
The Dow and the S&P 500 indexes both hit new highs in mid-March, boosted
by favorable economic data and improved earnings expectations in several
sectors; financial shares were notably strong. However, both indexes have
since retreated 3 to 4 percent from their highs on renewed concerns that
earnings may not be buoyant enough to support the lofty valuations. These
concerns have centered on computer-related firms, contributing to the
6 percent decline in the Nasdaq over the intermeeting period. The Russell
2000 fell another 10 percent, placing it more than 20 percent below its record
high set almost a year ago. Despite the recent setback in the market, both the
S&P 500 and Nasdaq P/E ratios remain close to record levels.
The $8-1/2 billion of gross equity offerings in February was the highest
monthly total since the market plunge last summer. Seasoned issuance was
dominated by telecommunications firms. IPOs by Internet-related companies
have met with exceptionally strong demand, but investors have been less
receptive to other IPOs. Overall, the rise in the pace of registration
statements since January points to a steady stream of IPO offerings in the
next few months.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Gross issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained strong in
the first quarter. Most of the overhang of loans originated before the onset of
market turmoil last summer appears to have been eliminated this quarter, and
conduit lenders have reportedly returned to originating mortgages in volume.
1 Inputs to the model are the rating distribution of outstanding bonds, the percentage of
banks tightening low underwriting standards, and aggregate default rate predictions from a
private firm model which forecasts firms' default probabilities based on their outstanding debt
and asset values and asset volatility.

$16 billion, well above market analysts' predictions just a few months ago,
but a little below the estimated current-quarter pace.
Although financing for commercial real estate transactions appears to be
readily available, risk spreads remain elevated compared with a year ago.
Relative to ten-year Treasury yields, spreads on AAA-rated securities, which
account for nearly three-quarters of the CMBS market, were about unchanged
over the intermeeting period and are still more than 40 basis points above
their level a year ago. Spreads on other investment-grade CMBS narrowed
slightly over the intermeeting period, while below-investment-grade spreads
changed little on balance and are quite wide relative to early last year.
Newly available data for the fourth quarter confirm that institutional lenders
and banks jumped into the commercial mortgage loan market when conduit
lending shut down last fall. Lending by commercial banks and originators of
loans for federally related mortgage pools (mainly Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac) remained elevated in the fourth quarter, after a pickup in the third
quarter. Life insurance companies also stepped up their lending in the fourth
quarter following several years of virtually no increase in holdings of such
loans. Information from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and large commercial
banks indicates that they have continued to be active in the commercial
mortgage market so far this year.
REIT stock prices continue to languish, holding down the pace of REIT
equity issuance and property acquisition. However, several large REITs have
marketed unsecured debt in the past two months and used the proceeds to pay
down bank lines that were drawn in 1998. The issues were heavily
oversubscribed; as an industry, REITs have issued over $3 billion in
unsecured debt in the first two and a half months of 1999, a little more than
over the final five months of 1998.
Household Finance
The ratio of households' net worth to disposable income hit a record in the
fourth quarter and was on track to be higher still in the first quarter, before
the last several days' stock market declines. Mutual fund shareholders have
displayed some queasiness in their appetite for new equity fund shares, with
inflows to domestic equity funds still running below the pace of early last
year, although some renewed strength was evident in the first half of March.
International equity funds recorded an outflow of almost $3 billion in
February, more than reversing the small inflow in January and continuing the
trend of outflows from international funds that started in August of last year.
Likewise, sample data suggest that 401(k) plan holders have made efforts to

limit their rising exposure to equities. The share of new 401(k) contributions
to company stock and equity funds dropped in February to about one-half of
total contributions, from an average pace of about two-thirds over the last
year. Transfers among existing assets, which involved only about 1 percent
of account balances in February, were primarily from international to
domestic equity funds.
Household debt appears to be continuing its brisk growth in the first quarter.
After increasing at a surprisingly sluggish 3 percent rate in December,
consumer credit surged at a 13-1/2 percent pace in January, despite little
growth in consumer loans at banks. Home mortgage debt probably will
moderate somewhat this quarter from the 11 percent pace recorded in the
fourth; the MBA purchase and refinance indexes have subsided since last fall,
and that tendency may continue in coming weeks as a consequence of the
recent rise in mortgage rates.
The latest readings on household credit quality have either been roughly
stable or tilted toward the positive side. ABA data show that delinquencies
on consumer closed-end loans and credit cards edged up slightly in the fourth
quarter, but stayed within the relatively elevated range observed over the last
year and a half. Moody's reported that, in January, the delinquency rate on
securitized credit card receivables remained near its lowest level in two and a
half years, and the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that sixty-day-and-
over delinquencies on home mortgage loans declined in the fourth quarter,
continuing the downtrend established last year.
Further evidence on the unwinding of market stresses appears in investors'
renewed enthusiasm for asset-backed securities, where spreads declined
dramatically in January and February. Issuance of asset-backed securities
during these months has been strong--February's $21 billion was the highest
ever recorded for that month--with a large share backed by home-equity and
auto loans.
Federal Government and Agency Finance
The federal budget is actually expected to show a small surplus in the first
quarter, in advance of spring tax season, and Treasury borrowing, on net, has
been light. Weekly bill auctions were pared from $15 billion to $14 billion in
mid-March, and the February quarterly refunding package of notes and bonds
was lowered $3 billion from the $38 billion total in November. The Treasury
also announced that it plans a modest reduction in the offering size of ten-
and thirty-year inflation-protected securities and is considering reducing the
frequency of new issues of the nominal thirty-year bond and two-year note.
However, the mid-March two-year note auction took place with no changes.
The Treasury also issued a large volume of cash management bills over the

intermeeting period, scheduled to mature with the bulge of April tax receipts,
in order to maintain its cash balance and allow substantial paydowns of
coupon debt.
Government-sponsored enterprises have continued to tap global markets, and
to structure issues in ways that capture some of the liquidity benefits that the
Treasury is losing as its issue sizes decline. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
recently issued $7 billion and $9 billion of global reference and benchmark
notes, respectively, while the Federal Home Loan Bank placed $10 billion of
global long-term debt. Moreover, Fannie Mae has offered to exchange about
$15 billion of outstanding debt for five-year benchmark notes and reopened
its February five-year note for an additional $2 billion in mid-March. Fannie
and Freddie have used proceeds from these issues to expand the volume of
mortgages that they retain on their books. Spreads between benchmark and
reference notes and comparable Treasuries showed mixed, modest changes
over the intermeeting period. While off their October peaks, these spreads
have remained about twice their year-ago levels, held up in part by the large
issuance.
Municipal Finance
Gross long-term municipal bond issuance totaled about $16 billion in
February, close to the January pace but down from the elevated fourth-quarter
rate. New capital financing remains strong, supported in particular by
borrowing for education projects. Advanced refundings were appreciably
below the fourth-quarter rate, as the pool of bonds for which early refunding
is both possible and profitable diminished significantly with the heavy
refunding volume of 1998.
Municipal bond yields rose only about half as much as long-term Treasury
yields over the intermeeting period, bringing yield ratios down near levels
observed before last summer's market turmoil. The revenue-to-Treasury bond
ratio now stands at 0.97, down from 1.02 as of the last FOMC meeting.
Credit quality has been stable over the intermeeting period, with a roughly
equal number of upgrades and downgrades.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates continued to moderate over the
intermeeting period. After the rapid 11 percent growth rate in the fourth
quarter, M2 decelerated to roughly a 6 percent pace in January and February.
Preliminary data for early March suggest that M2 expansion slowed further.
The deceleration this year may reflect some shifting by households toward
longer-term assets not in M2, whose yields have risen while rates on
components of M2 remain historically low. The deceleration in the liquid

deposit and retail money fund components of M2 is also consistent with a
further unwinding of risk and liquidity concerns.
M3 expanded at a 10-1/2 percent annual rate in February, up from 4 percent
in January but still below the 13 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1998.
However, a substantial portion of the February strength in M3 came from an
unusually large volume of RP funding by a single bank for Treasury auction
purchases, which boosted the M3 growth rate by 2-1/4 percentage points.
The strength in February was also attributable, in part, to a shift in the mix of
bank liabilities toward those included in the M3 aggregate. Bank repurchase
agreements generally increased sharply, along with Eurodollar deposits, while
federal government deposits, which are not included in M3, declined.
Institution-only money market mutual fund growth slowed somewhat from the
torrid pace in the fourth quarter of 1998, but it has remained robust as
corporations apparently have continued to out-source their cash management.
Weekly data through early March suggest a pronounced slowdown in M3 this
month.
Bank credit (adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules) unwound from its
fourth-quarter bulge in both January and February, showing weakness in
securities holdings and across all loan categories. Real estate loans
decelerated, as the pace of home sales and mortgage refinancing has cooled a
bit in recent months. In addition, banks reportedly have securitized the raft of
refinancing loans that closed last fall. Business loans, which grew rapidly last
year when capital market disruptions prompted firms to draw heavily on
outstanding lines of credit at banks, were about flat on balance in February
and early March. Banks have also reduced their holdings of securities after
building up portfolios late last year, when private and agency risk spreads
widened. Preliminary data for March suggest another weak month for total
bank credit.
The February survey of terms of business lending shows the spread between
rates on newly originated C&I loans and the intended federal funds rate to
have narrowed slightly from the previous survey in November. The most
significant move was in rates on large loans (those greater than $1 million),
which reversed 6 basis points of their 16 basis point increase over the three
months ending in November. Reports suggest that pricing has also eased
moderately in the syndicated loan market since January.
Fourth-quarter call reports reveal that the return on equity at commercial
banks slipped further last quarter to its lowest level in six years, although
bank profits remained historically strong. So far, gains in nondeposit fee
income have partially offset higher merger-related expenses and narrower
interest margins. The call reports also show that delinquency rates on

III-18
mortgage loans and business loans remained quite subdued in the fourth
quarter, while consumer loan delinquencies held at an elevated level. The
behavior of net charge-off rates has been broadly similar to that of
delinquency rates, except that the rate on C&I loans has shown an upward
trend over the past two years and rose further in the fourth quarter.

The value of exports fell 1.4 percent in January, the third consecutive month of
decline. Half of the decrease in January was in agricultural products, especially
corn, soybeans and cotton. The remaining decline was largely in exported
automotive parts to countries other than Canada and Mexico and in the value of
chemicals. Exported machinery (other than computers and semiconductors)
decreased in January for the third consecutive month. Exports to countries in
Asia generally turned down in January from peak levels in December that had
been boosted by record deliveries of aircraft. The level of total exports in
January was 3 percent less than the fourth-quarter average.
The value of imports rose 2 percent in January, nearly reversing the decline in
December. About one-fourth of the increase was in imported consumer goods.
In addition, strong increases were recorded for automotive vehicles from Canada
and computers, which reversed the declines for both categories of trade recorded
in December. The value of imported oil was about the same in January as in
December as a small decline in price was about offset by an increase in quantity.
The level of total imports in January was 3 percent above the fourth-quarter
average.

Quantity and price of imported oil. The quantity of imported oil rose in
January from a low level in December. Preliminary Department of Energy
statistics indicate higher imports in February. The increases in January and
February largely reflect declines in domestic production and the onset of colder
weather.
After decreasing 8 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1998, the
price of imported oil fell further in January. This decline in price was driven by
lower consumption, unseasonably warm weather, high exports from Iraq, and
high crude oil inventories. The average spot price of West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) fell to $12.01 per barrel in February from $12.47 in January. This decline
was driven largely by unexpectedly high production from Iran and Iraq; together
they increased output by 400,000 barrels per day from January levels. During
the first three weeks of March, the spot price for WTI increased $3 per barrel in
anticipation of supply cuts from OPEC producers. On March 23, OPEC signed
an agreement to reduce oil supply by nearly 2 million barrels per day.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of non-oil goods imports
declined slightly in February after rising in January. Prices of "core" goods
imports (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) moved similarly.
For January-February combined, prices of "core" goods rose slightly with
increases in capital goods, automotive products, and consumer goods largely
offset by declines in prices of imported foods and industrial supplies. Prices of
imported computers fell only slightly and prices of imported semiconductors
rose.
Prices of goods exports declined marginally in February after being unchanged
in January. For January-February combined, prices decreased only 0.2 percent at
an annual rate. Prices of both agricultural (largely soybeans) and nonagricultural
products fell. Prices of exported "core" goods (which exclude agricultural
products, computers, and semiconductors) rose 0.1 percent at an annual rate.
Increases in prices of exported capital equipment and automotive products
slightly outweighed declines in prices of exported industrial supplies and
consumer goods.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit narrowed slightly in the fourth quarter to $255
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The decrease resulted from smaller
deficits for goods and services and for investment income; net unilateral
transfers rose, mostly due to an increase in U.S. government grants to Israel.
The smaller deficit for goods and services reflected both an improved trade
balance (as exports increased faster than imports) and a larger surplus on
services (as receipts increased more than payments). The smaller deficit on
investment income was entirely due to a larger surplus on net direct investment
income, with receipts increasing more than payments.

The U.S. current account deficit for the year 1998 increased to a record $233
billion or 2.7 percent of GDP. Larger deficits on goods and services and on
investment income accounted for most of the increase, although net unilateral
transfers also grew.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In 1998, foreign official assets held in the United States declined, mainly as a
result of large third-quarter outflows (line 1 of the U.S. International
Transactions table). Brazil and Greater China, facing pressure to devalue,
accounted for a large share of the third-quarter depletion. Inflows resumed in
the fourth quarter and continued into the new year. In January 1999, Saudi
Arabia and Japan increased their reserves, while Argentina and Brazil drew on
their reserves as pressure on their currencies escalated. Partial data through early
March, from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggest that Brazilian and
Argentinean official reserves have stabilized (at least temporarily). Singapore
also drew on their reserves in January, which may be associated with a reported
move into euro reserves.
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners rebounded in the fourth
quarter of 1998, returning to levels recorded at the beginning of the year (line 4).
However, in January 1999, foreign net purchases of U.S. securities were again
small, with net purchases of U.S. Treasuries especially weak (line 4a).
Residents of Japan bought Treasury bills, and financial centers in the Caribbean
sold Treasury bonds and notes. Foreign purchases of other U.S. securities
remained positive, but fell from their fourth quarter highs (line 4b and 4c). The
United Kingdom and Germany more than accounted for the recorded net
purchases of U.S. stocks in January; net selling was concentrated in Singapore
and in financial centers in the Caribbean. As in 1998, foreign purchases of
corporate and other bonds were responsible for the largest share of the total net
securities inflow in January. Agency purchases accounted for nearly all of the
January gain.
U.S. investors sold foreign bonds and stocks on net in the late summer and early
fall of 1998 (line 5), probably reflecting the Russian default and the collapse of
Long Term Capital Management. Toward the end of the year, U.S. residents
bought foreign securities on net as uncertainty in foreign markets subsided. In
January, most likely as a result of the Brazilian devaluation, investors in the
United States again retreated from foreign securities. Sales were concentrated in
Brazil and in financial centers in Europe and the Caribbean.

Moderate inflows through banking offices in the United States continued in
1998 (line 3). Foreign chartered banks accounted for most of the large
December inflow, offsetting a November outflow of similar magnitude. In
January 1999, a modest bank inflow was reported. Partial data for February
show large inflows by foreign offices of U.S. banks.
Foreign direct investment in the United States soared in 1998 (line 7), largely as
a result of two mega-mergers (BP-Amoco and Daimler-Chrysler) that were
completed in the fourth quarter. The two mergers were associated with an
increase in U.S. holdings of foreign securities that is not incorporated into U.S.
net purchases of foreign securities (line 5). To reconcile this in the balance of
payments accounts, other flows (line 9) show a large net outflow in the fourth
quarter. U.S. direct investment abroad remained robust throughout 1998 (line
6).
The statistical discrepancy in the U.S. international accounts narrowed
significantly in 1998 (last line), as compared with 1997. In the third quarter, the
statistical discrepancy was revised up from negative $3.5 billion to positive
$27.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, the statistical discrepancy was negative
$30.6 billion, indicating some combination of over-recorded net capital inflows
or under-recorded net exports.

In the period following the February FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar rose 2.2 percent on a weighted average basis against the other major
currencies, led by an appreciation of 4.6 percent against the yen and 3.5 percent
in terms of the euro.

Movements of the yen have been strongly correlated with the yield of the
10-year Japanese government bond (JGB), which declined more than 50 basis
points. At the beginning of this period, the JGB yield reached an 18-month high
of 2.36 percent, as projections that the Japanese government would greatly
increase future issuance of bonds to fund larger-than-expected stimulus
measures came on the back of statements from the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
that it would be reducing its purchases of these bonds. At the same time, the yen
hovered near the rate of 112 yen/dollar. Given JGB yields, market forces might
have caused the yen to strengthen to under 112 yen/dollar; however, the
Japanese intervention to weaken the yen in early January seemed to remain a
factor for traders. Furthermore, policymakers in Japan appeared to be in
agreement that yen appreciation to a level stronger than 110 yen/dollar would be
detrimental to the economy. In addition, Japanese government officials began
to express concern over the rise in long-term interest rates, and some officials
called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to increase JGB purchases. While the BOJ
rejected calls to underwrite JGBs either directly or indirectly, on February 12 the

IV-11
BOJ Policy Board lowered its target on the overnight call rate 10 basis points to
a level of 15 basis points and announced it intended to try to move the call rate
even lower in the future. In fact, within a few days the call rate fell nearly to
zero. Shortly afterwards, the MoF announced that the monthly 10-year JGB
issue size would be reduced for the remainder of the fiscal year and that
purchases by the Trust Fund Bureau would be resumed.

Throughout February, the dollar appreciated against the euro, gaining 3 percent.
The dollar's appreciation against the euro was driven by a series of data releases
showing the U.S. economy maintaining surprisingly strong momentum. Also,
data showing growth in Germany and Italy at rates below earlier market
projections fueled expectations that the ECB Governing Council might ease in
the near term. On balance, the dollar has moved up slightly against the euro so
far in March; a 2-1/2 percent jump in the value of the euro immediately
following the resignation of German Finance Minister Lafontaine on March 11
was quickly reversed.

IV-12
During the intermeeting period, the U.S. dollar fell 1/2 percent against the
Canadian dollar and was, on balance, unchanged against the Australian dollar,
amid a rebound in commodity prices, especially oil. The dollar also remained
unchanged against sterling, even as the Bank of England lowered its official repo
rate 50 basis points, more than had been expected, in response to continuing
signs of weak economic activity in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, yields on
10-year gilts rose 40 basis points.
Yields on 10-year government securities rose about 30 basis points in the euro
area and 40 basis points in the United States, while rising only 15 basis points in
Canada. Earlier in March, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury rose above the
yield on the Canadian 10-year bond for the first time in eight months.
Throughout the rest of March, the bond yields have remained within a few basis
points of each other.
The dollar was little changed versus the currencies of our other important trading
partners, with a 2 percent appreciation versus the Brazilian real offset by a 4
percent depreciation against the Mexican peso. Financial markets in Brazil have
shaken off the turmoil that was triggered in early January when the state of
Minas Gerais declared a moratorium on debt payments to the central
government. There has been a sequence of positive market reactions approving
the appointment, in early February, of Arminio Fraga as Brazil's central bank
president. The agreement reached with the IMF that paves the way for payment
of a second tranche of financial aid added further support to the real, Brazilian
Brady bonds, and equities. The Mexican peso has also benefitted from the
swing toward optimism in emerging markets. In addition, the strong growth in
the U.S. economy coupled with the recent sharp rise in oil prices and lower-than-
expected inflation in Mexico have contributed to a rise in the Mexican peso as
well as the prices of equities and Mexican Brady bonds.
The fall in the yen vis-á-vis the dollar contributed to a weakening of the
currencies of the emerging Asian economies. The Korean won, the Taiwan
dollar, the Indonesian rupiah, and Thai baht depreciated between 2 and 4-1/2
percent against the dollar. In local currency terms, share prices rose between 5
and 20 percent in these countries, with the exception of Indonesia, which saw a 3
percent decline as domestic turmoil continued. Share prices of Indonesian
financial institutions fell amid the release of the specifics of the program to shut
down a large number of insolvent Indonesian banks.

IV-13
The price of gold rose 2 percent towards the beginning of March. However,
following proposals by Presidents Clinton and Chirac that the International
Monetary Fund sell some of its gold reserves to finance part of a debt relief
initiative for highly indebted poor countries, gold prices subsequently fell over 3
percent, and on net are 1 percent lower in the period following the February
FOMC.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in most of the major industrial countries has shown signs of
weakness in recent months. During the fourth quarter, Japanese GDP registered
its fifth consecutive quarterly decline, and recent data provide little evidence of
an impending recovery, although some indications of stability may be emerging.
In the euro zone, fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed sharply, with outright
contractions in Germany and Italy but continued strength in France. In the
United Kingdom, following a year of lackluster growth, economic activity
remains subdued. In all of the aforementioned countries, external demand made
a significantly negative contribution to growth during the fourth quarter, mainly
reflecting sharp declines in exports. In Canada, by contrast, growth rebounded
during the fourth quarter, and exports surged.
Inflationary pressures in these economies have remained nonexistent, with
evidence of incipient deflation in Japan and 12-month increases in consumer
prices of less than 1 percent in the euro area and Canada.
In Japan, real GDP declined 3.2 percent (SAAR) during the fourth quarter.
Residential and business investment plunged 25 percent and 21 percent,
respectively, and private consumption weakened slightly. All told, private
domestic demand declined 6.3 percent, the poorest performance since 1997Q2
when an increase in the consumption tax triggered a steep drop in expenditure.
External demand also made a negative contribution to growth, subtracting 1.3
percentage points, as exports fell 13 percent. Imports registered their seventh
consecutive quarterly decline, falling 6 percent. The weakness in private
expenditure and net exports was only partially offset by a 50 percent surge in
public investment, due largely to the effects of the April 1998 stimulus package.
Recent economic indicators are mixed, with some suggesting that the economy
has stopped contracting and others pointing to further declines. Notably,
industrial production appears to have stabilized in recent months, and industrial
firms have made some progress in paring inventory levels. In addition,
consumption indicators such as household expenditure and retail sales have been
stable. On the other hand, machinery orders during January were down 1.5

percent (not annualized) from an already weak fourth-quarter average and down
15.8 percent from a year earlier. Similarly, new public works contracts during
the fourth quarter fell 4 percent (not annualized) from the third-quarter average
and declined further during January. Labor market conditions also remain
severe, with unemployment at a record high of 4.4 percent for three consecutive
months and the offers-to-applicants ratio near an all-time low.
There is mounting evidence of deflation in the Japanese economy. In February,
both the CPI and the "core" CPI registered twelve-month declines, while the
wholesale price index was down a sizable 3.8 percent from a year earlier. The
decline in wholesale prices largely reflects the yen's sharp appreciation during
the second half of 1998 and weakness in the prices of energy and other
commodities. Total employee earnings in January were down 2 percent from a
year earlier, following a 4 percent drop in December, with bonus payments
showing particularly sharp declines.
Japan's current account surplus during 1998 rose to $122 billion, up sharply
from the $94 billion surplus recorded in 1997. The current account remained on
a rising trend during January, reaching $12.2 billion (or $146.8 billion at an
annual rate).

On February 12, the Bank of Japan's Policy Board cut its target for the overnight
call-money rate from 25 basis points to 15 basis points and promised further
declines if there was no "disturbance in the market." The BOJ also indicated
that it would "encourage the expansion" of the monetary aggregates in an effort
to offset deflationary pressures. Following the meeting, the BOJ aggressively
injected liquidity into the interbank market, pushing the overnight call-money
rate below 5 basis points during most of March.
Preliminary statistics for the eleven countries in the euro zone confirm a
significant slowing in the growth of real GDP during the fourth quarter. The
slowing owed primarily to a contraction in real activity in Germany and Italy,
while the French economy expanded at a healthy pace. (Taken together,
Germany, France, and Italy account for almost 75 percent of real output in the
euro area). In Germany, domestic demand growth weakened, despite robust
private consumption spending. In France, while consumption was also strong,
the strength in domestic demand was broadly based and included a sharp rise in
business fixed investment. In all three countries, export growth turned sharply
negative in the fourth quarter. Although imports in all three countries contracted
as well, on net the external balance subtracted from growth during the fourth
quarter.

Only limited information is available on economic developments during the first
quarter. Based on surveys of the eleven countries in the euro area conducted by
the European Commission, consumer confidence rose in January from its level
at the end of 1998. Although business confidence in the construction sector has
improved somewhat this year, confidence in the manufacturing sector dropped
further in February. Both domestic and export orders weakened considerably in
euro-zone countries; this weakening has been particularly striking for Germany,
France, and Italy. The drop-off in orders was accompanied by a rise in the
percentage of firms reporting that stocks of finished goods are too high.

In France, industrial production posted a significant rise in January, while
consumption of manufactured products (not shown on the table) surged. The
unemployment rate for the euro zone edged down slightly in January to 10.6
percent. Consumer price inflation remains at historically low levels in the euro
area, with Germany and France teetering on the brink of deflation.
Based on national statistics for each of the eleven countries in the euro area, the
weighted-average general government deficit narrowed further in 1998 to 2.1
percent of GDP from 2.5 percent in 1997. In six of the countries, the fiscal
situation appears to give no cause for immediate concern, as the balance shows a
surplus or small deficit. In three other countries (including Germany), the
government registered a deficit near 2 percent of GDP, suggesting that as growth
slows, automatic stabilizers could push the deficit up toward the Stability and
Growth Pact (SGP) limit of 3 percent of GDP. In France and Italy, the situation
is even more problematic. Neither country posted any significant improvement
in its fiscal deficit last year, with both very close to the SGP limit.

In a highly unexpected move, German Finance Minister Lafontaine announced
his resignation in early March from the cabinet and as leader of the Social
Democratic Party. Chancellor Schroeder has appointed Hans Eichel, Minister-
President of Hesse to replace Lafontaine at the Finance Ministry. Schroeder is
slated to be confirmed as party leader at a caucus in early April.
In early February, former Italian Prime Minister Prodi formed a new political
group, further splintering the unity of the center-left bloc that currently heads the
government. The new group, Democrats for the Olive Tree, will focus over the
short term on the upcoming elections for the European Parliament in June.
Prodi is reportedly a top candidate to succeed Jacques Santer as head of the
European Commission; Santer resigned from his post, together with other
Commissioners, in mid-March following publication of report indicating
widespread fraud and mismanagement. One of the first responsibilities of the
new European Parliament will be to select Santer's successor.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP growth slowed markedly last year, with
fourth-quarter growth falling to 0.4 percent (SAAR). While consumer
expenditure picked up during the fourth quarter and investment spending
continued at a healthy pace, net exports made a large negative contribution to
growth, as exports fell sharply and imports remained quite strong.
Indicators for the current quarter point to subdued activity. Industrial production
declined in January, in large part reflecting lower output of utilities industries
during a warmer-than-normal January. Manufacturing output registered a slight
increase, following six consecutive monthly declines. Business surveys for
February indicate further contraction of the manufacturing sector in the near
term, but suggest that manufacturers are somewhat less pessimistic about future
prospects for output and orders. Retail sales rebounded in January, as
consumers apparently took advantage of sales; for January and February on
average, sales were up 0.7 percent from the fourth-quarter average. The official
claims-based unemployment rate remained 4.6 percent in February.
In early March, average earnings data were released; the series had been
suspended since November, pending a methodological review. The newly
revised series indicates that although earnings growth picked up in the first half
of last year, it has since slowed. Producer input prices continued to decline in

February. The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) was 2.4 percent in February, slightly below the inflation
target. On an EU-harmonized basis, U.K. consumer price inflation is somewhat
lower, registering 1.5 percent in February.
At its March meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of
England left the official repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent, following five
consecutive monthly reductions totaling 200 basis points. The minutes of the
meeting indicate that, on balance, the news since the publication of the February
Inflation Report pointed to slightly lower inflation. Accordingly, the MPC
maintained an easing bias, stating that "the direction of interest rates was still
more likely than not to be down."
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown presented the Government's fiscal
year 1999/00 budget on March 9. The budget is moderately stimulative, with
most of the proposals addressing about £4 billion in tax cuts geared largely
towards middle- and lower-income working families; nonetheless, the
Government projects that the budget will remain in slight surplus over the next
several years. The economic forecasts underlying the budget are unchanged
from last November's pre-budget report, and call for somewhat stronger growth
this year than most private sector forecasts.

In Canada, fourth-quarter GDP growth rebounded sharply from the lackluster
pace recorded earlier in 1998. Despite meager consumer spending growth
during the fourth quarter, domestic demand rose 4.8 percent (SAAR). This
mainly reflected a sizable recovery in inventory investment, as firms rebuilt
inventories depleted by strikes last summer and fall. In addition, growth in
business fixed investment resumed in the fourth quarter, led by strong demand
for computers and office equipment. Net exports made a small positive
contribution to growth, as both exports and imports, particularly for automotive
products, surged during the fourth quarter.

Recent economic indicators suggest that the fourth-quarter upswing in activity
has continued. Employment growth remained brisk in January and February,
and retail sales in January rose sharply.
In recent months, inflation has moved lower. The twelve-month change in
consumer price inflation fell from 1.2 percent in December to 0.7 percent in
February. Four-quarter hourly wage inflation in the manufacturing sector was
only 1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to 2.7 percent in the third quarter.
The producer price index in January was down 0.3 percent from a year earlier.

In February, the government announced the federal budget for fiscal years
1999/00 and 2000/01. Although the federal budget is expected to run surpluses
over the next two years, fiscal policy is expected to be somewhat more
expansionary. The government announced C$5.4 billion in immediate new
spending, as well as modest tax reductions. These tax cuts are expected to
reduce federal revenues by C$1.5 billion in 1999/00 and C$2.8 billion in
2000/01.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In the aftermath of the collapse in mid-January of the Brazilian real's peg to the
U.S. dollar, the Brazilian currency fell by about 35 percent, and considerable
uncertainties about the economy's prospects remain. Brazilian real GDP fell
sharply late last year, and inflationary pressures have surfaced. Elsewhere in
Latin America, economic activity also continued to decline due to high interest
rates and recent disruptions to capital flows. Although contagion from Brazil to
date has been more limited than expected, recent data indicate that sluggishness
in economic activity has continued into this year. Despite declining economic
activity, trade adjustment in the region has not generally been as strong as might
be expected, reflecting weakness in exports. Inflation remained virtually non-
existent in Argentina, moderate in Mexico, and quite high in Venezuela.
Ecuador has encountered financial woes, but its problems are primarily home-
grown in origin and are not expected to spill over into other countries.
In the Asian developing economies, there are signs that recovery has begun in
Korea and that economic activity in the ASEAN countries may be close to
bottoming out, although in Taiwan growth has slowed. Korea and all of the
ASEAN countries are running trade surpluses as a result of weakness in imports.
However, this has contributed to a narrowing of the trade surpluses of China and
Taiwan, as the demand for their exports from the other Asian economies has
declined. Inflation rates in the developing Asia region have generally remained
stable.
The economic situation in Russia continues to deteriorate. Russia has made
some progress in restructuring its domestic public debt, but remains locked in a
dispute with the IMF over appropriate fiscal policy.
In Brazil, uncertainty about whether the government has the determination to
implement needed fiscal and monetary policies has dominated financial
developments in recent weeks. Late January witnessed the removal of central
bank President Francisco Lopes, who had been on the job for only two weeks,
and the appointment of Arminio Fraga, a former employee of George Soros, to
the post. The move appears to have been prompted by President Cardoso's
dissatisfaction concerning Lopes' handling of the government's decision to
allow the real to float. Senate confirmation of Fraga's appointment was delayed
until early March, as a consequence of both the carnival holiday and charges that
the Soros Fund had profited from advance notice of Fraga's appointment.
(Fraga denied the charges.) Within 24 hours of Fraga's senate confirmation on
March 3, the central bank monetary policy committee met and raised the
overnight interest rate from 39 to 45 percent.

IV-28
As a consequence of the depreciation of the real, consumer price inflation,
which had been either negative or negligible in December, depending on the
index, rose to about 13 percent per annum in January and to about 20 percent per
annum in February. The most recent weekly data suggest a downturn in
inflation, perhaps reflecting the central bank's rate hike in early March, as well
as the weak economy. Real GDP fell over 6 percent SAAR in the fourth quarter
of the year, the second consecutive quarterly decline. However, concerns about
future inflation have been raised by pressures to reintroduce indexation of wage
contracts, a practice that has been legally banned since 1995.

On March 8, Brazil and the IMF announced that they had concluded negotiations
on the revision of Brazil's $18 billion IMF program agreed to in December
1998. The revision of the program was necessary because the collapse of the
real in mid-January undermined the assumptions underlying the program. The
program is scheduled to be considered by the IMF Executive Board on March
30; its approval would pave the way for a second disbursement of about $8.6
billion from IMF resources and bilateral donors. Under the program, Brazil
commits to raising the primary balance from zero in 1998 to a surplus of 3.1
percent of GDP in 1999. The program provides for setting of monetary targets,
but these may be adjusted if there are signs that money demand has deviated
significantly from its projected path. Limited interventions in foreign exchange
markets are allowed, in part to finance the external deficit in the early months of
this year, and in fact there have been some moderate intervention operations in

IV-29
recent weeks. International reserves have fallen from about $36 billion in late
January to about $34 billion recently.
The Mexican economy experienced a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of
1998. In response to high interest rates and capital outflows after the Russian
crisis, real gross domestic product was nearly flat in the fourth quarter (SAAR).
Recent monthly data indicate that the economy is still sluggish. The trade deficit
shrank in January and February, primarily due to a fall-off in merchandise
imports. Prices rose only 1.3 percent in February over the previous month,
following increases of 2.4 and 2.5 percent in December and January,
respectively.

In recent weeks, financial markets in Mexico have rallied to levels not seen since
before last August's Russian crisis. Improved prospects for Brazil, higher oil
prices, as well as a booming U.S. equity market and strong import demand, have
provided a hefty boost to Mexico's equity and fixed-income markets. On
March 23, Mexico's stock market was up more than 40 percent since Brazil's
devaluation on January 13. Over the same period, the peso appreciated
8.6 percent, while interest rates on the benchmark 28 day Mexican treasury bills
(cetes) fell nearly 11 percentage points to about 22 percent.

In Argentina, the recession resulting from uncertainties associated with the
global financial turmoil continued. Real GDP in the fourth quarter of last year
declined for the second consecutive quarter. Monthly industrial production data
indicate that sluggishness in economic activity has continued into this year.
Despite the slowdown in growth in 1998, external balances deteriorated; this
reflects the fact that while growth of imports has slowed, export growth has
slowed by much more (particularly exports to Brazil), with exports declining
about 2 percent in 1998. With the currency peg holding, inflation remains
virtually non-existent.

The negative reaction of financial markets to the Brazilian devaluation in mid-
January proved to be more subdued than the reaction to the Russian devaluation
and debt moratorium last year. Domestic interest rates are now below their pre-
Brazilian crisis values. Brady spreads have also returned to the values prevailing
just before mid-January, but remain substantially higher than their pre-Asian
crisis values.
Shortly after the Brazilian currency collapse, the Argentine government
announced that it was considering a dollarization of its economy, which would
involve replacing its domestic currency with U.S. dollars. The objective is to
raise confidence in the economy and bring down Argentine interest rates by
eliminating the premium associated with devaluation risk. Several options are
being considered by the Argentine government, including a bilateral treaty with

IV-31
the United States that would allow for some sharing with the Argentine
government of seigniorage revenues that would accrue to the United States.
The Venezuelan economy continues to be plagued by the effects of the earlier
slump in world oil prices, a ballooning government budget deficit, and
uncertainties associated with the domestic political situation and global financial
conditions. In consequence, real GDP plummeted in the fourth quarter of last
year, making year-over-year growth in 1998 negative. Inflation continues to be
quite high, and, with the government not letting the domestic currency
depreciate at anywhere close to the inflation rate, the problem of exchange rate
overvaluation continues. The decline in oil prices and the overvaluation of the
currency contributed to turn the current account from a sizeable surplus in 1997
to a deficit in 1998.

The fall in oil revenues turned the central government's fiscal balance from a
surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP in 1997 into a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP in
1998. The government has announced an economic program that includes some
tax reform. However, the program is viewed as highly inadequate and
conservative estimates predict at least a doubling of the central government
deficit for this year.
Since the Central Bank of Ecuador let the national currency, the sucre, float on
February 12, it has lost over 50 percent of its value. On March 9, fearing further
large runs on commercial bank deposits precipitated by the sucre's fall, the
authorities declared a national banking holiday for the entire week. One day

IV-32
later, President Jamil Mahaud declared a national state of emergency. Although
Ecuador's economy has suffered from declining commodity prices (especially
oil) and El Niño-induced flooding, its current problems are largely a
consequence of prolonged large fiscal deficits and a history of economic
mismanagement. A recently approved fiscal package should generate revenue of
about 2.6 percent of GDP and will help reduce a current fiscal deficit of about
6 percent of GDP. The Mahaud administration also hopes that its passage will
release financial assistance from the IMF, World Bank, and others. However,
since the package was announced, Ecuador's second-largest bank has failed and
the sucre has fallen further.
In Korea, recent data provide further evidence that the steep drop in activity
bottomed out late last year and that recovery is underway. Real GDP grew
strongly in the fourth quarter of last year. Industrial production in January
showed a large gain from one year earlier, but declined 3.3 percent from the
previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, depressed in part by a strike at a
large semiconductor plant. Combined retail and wholesale sales, a widely
watched indicator of demand, showed a 2.8 percent 12-month rise in January,
the first such increase in 15 months, boosted by stronger consumer spending on
autos and other consumer durable goods. The unemployment rate rose to a
record high 8.7 percent in February. With promised corporate restructuring
likely to involve further layoffs, a weak labor market may hold down the
recovery in consumer spending. Rising unemployment and low capacity
utilization rates have continued to put downward pressure on prices, with
consumer prices showing almost no increase from their year-earlier level in
February.
The current account showed a positive swing of nearly $50 billion from 1997 to
1998. This movement was entirely accounted for by a drop in imports; the
dollar value of imports fell 35 percent in 1998 whereas export revenues were
about flat, although export volumes are believed to have risen.
In February, the government announced that Seoulbank, nationalized shortly
after the 1997 currency crisis, was being sold to a foreign bank, HSBC Holdings
of the United Kingdom. This sale follows the sale late last year of nationalized
Korea First Bank to U.S. interests and represents an important step in the
process of financial market restructuring.

Recent indicators for the ASEAN countries suggest that economic activity in the
region may be close to bottoming out. Fourth-quarter real GDP growth for both
the Philippines and Singapore was better than expected. Industrial production
numbers indicate that Thailand has bottomed out, and other ASEAN economies
may not be far behind.
All the ASEAN countries are running trade surpluses, with balances up sharply
across the region relative to last year. The improvement has resulted mainly
from a reduction in imports rather than increases in export revenues. However,
in recent months imports across the region appear to have stabilized, and trade
surpluses have begun to shrink.
ASEAN financial markets were generally flat as market participants await the
outcomes of anticipated reforms. Inflation appears to have stabilized across the
region, mainly reflecting weak domestic demand. Twelve-month inflation in
each of the ASEAN countries declined somewhat in January and February, while
prices in Singapore continue to fall.
Financial sector restructuring and reform have advanced in Indonesia and
Thailand recently. Indonesia closed 38 banks, nationalized seven others, and
recapitalized another nine. Thailand's parliament recently passed crucial
amendments to the country's bankruptcy and foreclosure laws to streamline the
legal process and improve creditors' power to seize collateral. Malaysia relaxed
some of its exchange controls by introducing an "exit tax" on repatriation of
foreign portfolio capital to replace measures implemented last September that
prohibited repatriation of investment principal until September 1999.

In Hong Kong, real GDP fell about 5.1 percent in 1998 from a year earlier,
according to preliminary data. Hong Kong's unemployment rate was 6 percent
during the December-February period, up from 5.5 percent during the
September-November period. In February 1999, consumer prices were below
their year-earlier level. Hong Kong's merchandise trade deficit continued to
narrow in recent months, reflecting continued weakening of imports. Foreign
exchange reserves were $90 billion at the end of February, up about $2 billion
from their recent low in September.
Authorities announced that the budget deficit in fiscal 1998/99 was about
$4 billion (about 2-1/2 percent of GDP) and that they expect a comparable
budget deficit in fiscal 1999/2000. The government plans to sell about two
thirds of its $19 billion equity portfolio, most of which was acquired in its

controversial August 1998 intervention. Spreads between one-year Hong Kong
government debt and U.S. Treasuries fell to around 170 basis points from about
230 basis points in late January.
In China, the trade surplus continued to narrow in recent months, largely
reflecting weakening exports. The value of exports in the first two months of
1999 fell 10 percent from its year-earlier level, while the value of imports rose
5 percent. Moderate deflation continues.
Chinese leaders met for the annual two-week National People's Congress (NPC)
in early March. Premier Zhu Rongji warned that it would be difficult to achieve
the government's 7 percent growth target for 1999, given weak domestic
demand, the "grim" external environment, and "lax" financial discipline.
Nevertheless, he asserted that the target would be achieved through a sizeable
increase in the fiscal deficit. Zhu claimed that China would continue with
difficult reforms of state-owned enterprises and the state banking system; many
analysts have argued that the slowdown in economic growth has slowed the pace
of reform. The NPC also passed a constitutional amendment recognizing private
enterprises as an "important component" of the national economy, and central
bank governor Dai Xianglong pledged to boost lending to private industry.
Following China's decision in January to put the Guangdong Investment and
Trust Corporation into bankruptcy, several rating agencies have downgraded
ratings for other Chinese financial institutions, including the major state
commercial banks. For example, S&P now rates the Bank of China, considered
the strongest of the major state banks, two notches below China's sovereign
rating for foreign currency counter party risk; a year ago, the Bank of China had
the same rating as the central government. Given the substantial bad debt
problems of the banks as well as their weak internal controls, the key question is
how much support these institutions will receive from the government in case of
financial difficulties. It remains likely that the government will continue to
guarantee deposits by Chinese savers at the banks. However, it is less clear that
the government will guarantee external liabilities.
In March, authorities confirmed press reports that China plans to establish
institutions modeled after the U.S. Resolution Trust Corporation to take some of
the bad loans off the books of the major commercial banks. China plans to
establish a separate institution for each of the four major banks, although the
timetable and procedures remain unclear.

In Taiwan, real GDP growth slowed considerably in the fourth quarter. For all
of 1998, GDP rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, the lowest growth rate since
1982. Unemployment was 2.7 percent in February, down from 2.8 percent in
January. Inflation was unchanged from its level at end-1998.
Taiwan's current account surplus in 1998 was the smallest surplus since 1983,
reflecting a sharp decline in exports, which in turn is a consequence of reduced
demand by other Asian economies. Taiwan's trade balance remained in surplus
in the first two months of 1999, with the value of exports rising 7 percent from a
year-earlier and the value of imports falling 6 percent. Foreign exchange
reserves rose to $93 billion in February, up about $2 billion from December and
the highest level since July 1997. Taiwan's stock market remained relatively
stable in early 1999, but this stability appears to reflect continuing intervention
by the government's stock stabilization fund.
Amid growing concern about slowing growth and weak bank health, Taiwan's
authorities in February announced several proposals aimed at improving the
operations of Taiwan's capital markets and stimulating the economy. The
proposals would make it easier for listed firms to buy back their own shares, "to
better ensure price stability." Other changes include reducing bank reserve
requirements for a range of deposits; cutting bank business taxes from five to
two percent; and raising the limit on foreign stock ownership from 30 percent to
50 percent of total market value.

The Russian economy remains in turmoil. Real GDP fell sharply in 1998.
Industrial output was down 5.2 percent for the year, although the rate of decline
has slowed since last September, as import substitution and the weak ruble
cushioned producers from the full fallout of the crisis. The ruble has depreciated
by about 11 percent in nominal terms against the dollar so far this year, and is
down roughly 75 percent since the onset of the August 1998 crisis. The sharp
increase in the cost of imports caused inflation to soar to over 100 percent in
February (twelve-month basis).
The government remains in a standoff with the IMF over fiscal policy. The IMF
has made known that it would like to see a primary (excluding interest
payments) surplus of 3-4 percent of GDP next year, and sees stronger revenue
performance as the key to accomplishing this task. Russia's 1999 budget aims
to trim the overall deficit from 5-1/2 percent of GDP in 1998 to 2-1/2 percent
this year, with a primary surplus of 1-3/4 percent. Several assumptions
underlying the budget seem overly optimistic, including an annual inflation rate
of 30 percent and an exchange rate of 21.5 rubles per dollar. Furthermore, the
budget assumes the resumption of IMF and World Bank lending as well as the
successful "re-rescheduling" of about $7 billion in Soviet-era debt.

The government continues to negotiate with foreign creditors on rescheduling its
Soviet-era external debt, while maintaining that it will meet in full all
obligations of the Russian Federation issued since 1991. Russia is due to make
several large payments on its debt this summer, an all the more pressing reason
to reach an agreement with the IMF as soon as possible. Several banks have
accepted the government's terms for restructuring short-term domestic debt,
leading to speculation that others may soon follow suit. The government plans
to permit foreigners to invest a portion of the restructured debt in the stock
market, a fact that has led the RTS index to rise almost 50 percent since the end
of January. Negotiations on restructuring Russia's $40 billion debt to the Paris
Club will not begin until after the government's economic plan wins approval
from the IMF.
The Central Bank has come under fire following the revelation that it entrusted
several billion dollars worth of foreign exchange reserves to FIMACO, a small
off-shore finance company in the Carribean. The scandal has raised doubts
about the integrity of the Central Bank and bolstered efforts to limit its
independence.
