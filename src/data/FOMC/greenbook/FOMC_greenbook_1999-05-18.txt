Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The striking combination of robust expansion and low inflation continued
during the first quarter. The fragmentary data for April and early May suggest
that the economy has maintained considerable momentum in the second quarter.
While wages have remained remarkably subdued in a tight labor market, prices
have been lifted by a sharp run-up in energy prices.
Real GDP
According to BEA's advance estimate, real GDP rose 4-1/2 percent at an annual
rate in the first quarter. Subsequently, we have received additional source data
that--all else equal--point to a downward revision to first-quarter GDP growth of
about 1/2 percentage point. The bulk of this revision can be accounted for by
lower-than-expected inventory accumulation in wholesale trade. Changes to
estimates for the components of final sales are expected to be small and roughly
offsetting. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion offirst-quarter activity in the
remainder of this section of the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions
to the GDP data.
Labor Market Developments
The April labor market report provided some mixed signals. But we believe that
the central feature, in terms of the strength of the economy, is the continued
rapid pace of hiring. Nonfarm payroll employment rose a substantial 234,000 in
April--above the first-quarter monthly average and on pace with the average
monthly growth in 1998.'
The gains in employment in April were concentrated in the service-producing
industries: Retail trade employment jumped 66,000 after having declined
24,000 in March, a swing that can be explained primarily by large gyrations in
jobs at eating and drinking places. Employment in finance, insurance, and real
estate increased 23,000 in April, and payroll growth in services totaled 131,000.
In construction, payrolls bounced back a slight 8,000 in April from the large
decline in March. Weather conditions played a role in this fluctuation, as they
do so often in this sector. Since October, construction payrolls have risen
32,000 per month, on average, indicating considerable strength in this industry
1. With the employment report to be released in early June, the payroll employment figures
will reflect the annual benchmark revision. Preliminary tabulations by the BLS indicate that
total nonfarm payroll employment for March 1998 will be revised upward by approximately
50,000, or about 0.04 percent. The revision will be wedged into the level of employment evenly
from April 1997 to March 1998. The anticipated revision is quite small compared with the
average revision of about 0.3 percent over the previous decade and does not noticeably affect
our views of the trends in employment, hours, or productivity.

over the period. In manufacturing, firms continued to shed jobs in April: The
decline of 29,000 brought the loss in that sector to almost 140,000 so far in
1999--and about 410,000 since the recent peak in March 1998. In mining,
where the weakness in the oil and gas extraction industry has taken a toll,
employment has fallen 26,000 since the beginning of the year.
Despite the overall strength of hiring, aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers in private industry rose 0.3 percent in April to a level
about 0.1 percent above the average for the first quarter (not at an annual
rate). In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked up a tenth in
April to 4.3 percent, matching the first-quarter average.
We are giving greater weight to the payroll employment figures in gauging the
strength of labor demand, in part because of the impressive evidence from a
range of supplementary measures. In particular, initial claims for
unemployment insurance have remained low, averaging 304,000 in the most
recent four weeks. In addition, in April, the Conference Board survey
continued to report an abundance of jobs and the Michigan SRC and the
Conference Board's measures of expected labor market conditions rose. And
although the Conference Board's Help Wanted Index ticked down recently, it
continued to point to very tight labor markets. Also, the National Federation
of Independent Businesses' survey of small firms indicated that about a third
of the respondents in April found jobs hard to fill.
Nonfarm business sector productivity surged again in the first quarter--rising
at an annual rate of about 4 percent according to the preliminary estimate from
the BLS, and about 3-1/2 percent after taking into account our anticipated
revision to output. The gains in recent quarters have been impressive,
running well above the average of the preceding couple of years--and, we
believe, more than can be attributed simply to a sluggish adjustment of labor
input to the surge in output. In fact, since the 1990-95 period, when
productivity growth averaged 1.0 percent per year, output per hour has
accelerated steadily. From the end of 1995 to the end of 1997, labor
productivity grew at an average annual rate of 1-3/4 percent per year. Since
the end of 1997, productivity has increased 2-3/4 percent per year, on
average. The acceleration in output per hour is consistent with the view that
we are beginning to see a payoff from capital deepening and, possibly,
structural gains in multifactor productivity.

Note. Data are shown on a methodologically consistent basis.

On the basis of production worker hours and available physical product data, the
staff estimates that both total industrial production and manufacturing output
increased sharply in April after having risen modestly in the first quarter.2
Motor vehicle assemblies rose from a 12.6 million unit annual rate in March to a
12.9 million unit annual rate in April, near the upper end of the high range that
has prevailed since last fall. But sales have also been exceptionally strong this
year, and inventories were still a little tight at the end of April. Accordingly, the
industry plans to push assemblies a bit above 13 million units at an annual rate,
on average, in May and June in an attempt to meet expected demand and to
replenish stocks.
Outside of the motor vehicle industry, the pickup in orders in the past few
months points to further advances in output in the near term. In the National
Association of Purchasing Management survey of manufacturers, the number of
respondents reporting increases in new orders has been exceeding the number
reporting decreases since January. The staffs estimate of real adjusted durable
goods orders rose 3.2 percent (not at an annual rate) in the first quarter, with
orders moving up across a range of categories--with especially large gains for
communications equipment. The Beige Book reports improvement in
manufacturing activity in most districts.
The acceleration in industrial production that seems to be under way may help
narrow the gap that has developed in recent quarters between growth in
industrial production and growth in the goods and structures component of
GDP. Both series advanced, on a four-quarter percent change basis, at around 4
to 5 percent between mid-1996 and mid-1998. However, industrial production
has decelerated sharply since the middle of last year while growth in goods and
structures GDP has been well maintained.
In part, the two series have diverged because the industries included in the IP
index account for only about half of the value of goods and structures GDP; the
remainder is the value added by the distributive industries (transportation,
wholesale and retail trade, and selected service industries) and construction,
which are insulated to some extent from the weak export demand and
competition from imports that have taken a toll on domestic manufacturers in
recent quarters. Indeed, profit margins for firms in the distributive industries
2. BLS reported a 0.1 percent increase in manufacturing hours in April. However, using the
FRB staff's seasonal adjustment procedure, we estimate a 0.4 percent increase in manufacturing
hours. The discrepancy between the FRB and BLS estimates results from the different treatment
of the Easter holiday in our seasonal adjustment methodology: The FRB seasonal factors reflect
more years of data and a more complete specification of the Easter effects than the BLS factors.

evidently have held steady or even increased, while manufacturers' profits have
generally been weak.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Consumer spending appears to have gathered additional speed this year, after
having posted a very sizable gain in 1998. Real expenditures rose a whopping
6-3/4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, as outlays for non-auto goods
soared and spending on services rose substantially. In April, spending on non-
auto goods appears to have remained brisk, while sales of motor vehicles
continued to exhibit exceptional strength. More broadly, the growth in
consumer spending this year has been fueled by rapid income growth, rising
equity prices, and cash freed up by mortgage refinancings and home sellers'
extraction of equity.
Motor vehicles. Overall sales of light vehicles held around 16-1/4 million units
in April, matching the blistering pace of the fourth and first quarters, and
industry sources expect sales this month to remain near the April level. Demand
has continued to be spurred by solid fundamentals--robust income, wealth, and
confidence--and by attractive pricing. On a twelve-month percent change basis,
the CPI for new motor vehicles has been rising much less rapidly than the core
CPI since early 1995, and has been declining in absolute terms since the end of
1997. Manufacturers have also continued to offer below-market rates on auto
loans. The Michigan survey's index of perceived car-buying conditions,
although down some from the recent peak in January, suggests that demand
should remain relatively healthy.
Other consumption and personal income. April's advance report on retail
sales suggests that consumer spending is on track for an appreciable gain this
quarter, but one much smaller than what occurred in the first quarter. In April,
nominal spending in the retail control category, which excludes sales at
automotive dealers and at building material and supply stores, rose 0.4 percent.
Within the control category, nominal spending at gasoline stations was up
sharply, but this gain reflected large increases in prices: Physical product data
from the Department of Energy indicate that real expenditures on gasoline
tumbled 3-3/4 percent in April. Putting this evidence together with the
incoming data on unit sales of autos and light trucks, we estimate that real
spending on all goods in April was 0.7 percent above the first-quarter level, not
at an annual rate.
Real spending on services rose at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
Expenditures on energy services rose sharply, as temperatures were not so
unusually warm as they had been in the fourth quarter of 1998. Outside of
energy, outlays on services increased at a 4 percent annual rate, paced by large

increases in spending on brokerage services, bank services, and recreation.
Early in the second quarter, the high volume of stock market trading in April
likely kept outlays for brokerage services at an elevated level; temperature data
suggest that energy spending also was up from the first-quarter average.
Real disposable income increased at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent in the first
quarter, led by another rapid gain in wages and salaries. Even so, income did
not grow so fast as personal outlays, and the personal saving rate declined
to -1/2 percent. However, the $31 billion of"dissaving" by households last
quarter was swamped by the appreciation of their stock market assets, which
was reflected in a further edging up in the ratio of household net worth to
disposable income.
The recent upsurge in energy prices will cut into gains in real income in the
current quarter. Indeed, a rise in consumer prices probably offset much of the
increase in nominal wage and salary income in April. However, other key
influences on spending have remained favorable. Major stock market indexes
have continued to advance. In addition, the April surveys from the University of
Michigan and the Conference Board indicate that consumers have remained
quite optimistic. Responses to most questions regarding current economic
conditions and expectations for the next year were still very upbeat. And,
although expectations of economic conditions over the next five years have
receded from the highs reached earlier in the year, they remained elevated.
Housing Markets
Housing activity remained strong in the first quarter, with total starts averaging
1.8 million units at an annual rate, 5-1/4 percent above the pace in the fourth
quarter of last year. In the single-family sector, starts totaled about 1.4 million
units (annual rate) in each month of the first quarter, resulting in the highest
quarterly pace of construction since late 1978. However, unseasonably good
weather probably helped boost starts in the first quarter. Moreover, adjusted
permits for new single-family homes--which tends to be a more statistically
reliable series than starts--decreased 4-1/2 percent in March, and the ratio of
starts to adjusted permits was well above its long-run average. The divergence
between starts and permits suggests that the March starts number may be
overstating the underlying pace of activity.
Other indicators suggest that housing activity may have peaked. In particular,
sales of new homes declined 5 percent in the first quarter to a level only a touch

above the 1998 average.3 Moreover, in April, both builders' evaluations of new
home sales and consumers' home buying attitudes, though still extremely
positive, remained below the high levels recorded at the end of last year. In
addition, even though applications for mortgages to finance home purchases
have turned back up in recent weeks, they remained below their peak of last fall.
The quality-adjusted prices of new homes have accelerated since mid-1998, and
the increase over the twelve months ending last quarter--5.0 percent--was the
largest since the fourth quarter of 1994. In addition to strong demand, home
prices have come under pressure from tight supplies of some building materials;
most notably, prices for plywood, gypsum wallboard, and insulation have
accelerated sharply over the past twelve months, and lumber prices have firmed
after having plummeted in 1997 and 1998. In contrast, we see only weak
evidence of pressures in the nationwide statistics on construction wages, despite
anecdotal reports of shortages of workers and big pay hikes in some areas of the
country. In fact, the average hourly earnings of construction workers have
actually decelerated over the past year. And although the twelve-month change
in the ECI for construction workers has picked up of late, the increase over the
twelve months ended in March was still less than 4 percent.
The shortages of building materials also seem to be contributing to a
lengthening of construction times. For example, in a survey conducted in March
by the National Association of Home Builders, about 40 percent of builders
reported some problems in obtaining enough wallboard to maintain production
schedules, and another 20 percent indicated serious shortages. All told, about
half the respondents indicated that shortages of building materials had delayed
completions by at least one or two weeks.4
Business Fixed Investment

10 percent annual rate in the first quarter, boosted by sizable advances in
spending on communications equipment and motor vehicles. With new orders
3. Sales of existing homes increased 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter to a level 5 percent
above the 1998 average. However, the increase mainly reflects earlier strength in the housing
market because a majority of existing home sales are recorded at closing. New home sales are
recorded when a contract is signed and, therefore, are a better indicator of current housing
activity.
4. In addition, annual data from the Census Bureau show that the average number of months
from start to completion of new single-family houses built for sale increased to 5.4 in 1998 after
having held steady at 5.2 over the preceding three years. (The standard deviation for this series
is just 0.05 month.) A significant lengthening also occurred in the time required to complete
multifamily structures with five or more units, from 9.2 months in 1997 to 9.6 months in 1998.

moving up and output having accelerated in recent quarters, the near-term
outlook for equipment spending is upbeat.
Real outlays on communications equipment soared in the first quarter, posting
an increase of more than 35 percent at an annual rate. Spending in this area is
likely to retain considerable momentum. Nominal orders rose 11-1/2 percent
(not at an annual rate) in the first quarter, and a substantial backlog of unfilled
orders has built up. The ongoing effort by telecommunications companies to
upgrade their networks to provide a full range of voice and data transmission
services appears to be providing a considerable boost to spending in this sector.
Growth in real outlays for office and computing equipment slowed to an annual
rate of about 25 percent in the first quarter after having exceeded 40 percent in
the fourth quarter and 60 percent in 1998 as a whole. Efforts to address the Y2K
problem undoubtedly lifted spending last year. But, with Y2K preparations well
along in most industries--and firms perhaps being cautious about disturbing their
systems--this addition to spending may be waning. On the other hand, the
continuing expansion in the use of the Internet may be spurring a considerable
amount of investment. Indeed, the first-quarter earnings of technology
companies were surprisingly strong, with some firms citing the explosion of
electronic commerce as a factor stimulating sales. Moreover, the plunge in
computer prices indicated by the PPI for April should boost real outlays on
computers in the current quarter.
Business spending on motor vehicles has been brisk of late, lifted by surging
sales of medium and heavy trucks. Sales of these trucks rose 6 percent in the
first quarter and held at the robust first-quarter pace in April. And, although the
preliminary data indicate a drop in orders in April, backlogs are sufficient to
sustain sales near the recent pace for the next couple of months. In addition,
fleet sales of autos and light trucks rebounded sharply in April after having been
depressed late in the first quarter when manufacturers shifted supplies to the
booming retail market.
Outlays on aircraft continued to fluctuate around a fairly high level in the first
quarter. Boeing's delivery schedule, as well as information from industry
contacts on the destination of these planes, suggests that domestic expenditures
on aircraft will be well maintained in the current quarter.
Outside the high-tech and transportation categories, spending on equipment
increased 3 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter after having recorded
only a small increase, on balance, in the second half of 1998. Moreover, the
outlook for outlays in this category appears to be improving: Nominal orders
rose 2.8 percent (not at an annual rate) in the first quarter. These figures are

impressive given that spending no doubt has been damped by the sluggishness

demand for this category.5
Nonresidential structures. Real spending on nonresidential construction
appears to have increased at a 3-3/4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after
factoring in the March construction put-in-place data, which were not available
for the advance GDP estimate. The growth in spending reflected sizable further
increases for office buildings and lodging facilities; spending in the other major
categories was little changed.
Business Inventories
(The retail trade inventories report for March will be released tomorrow and will
be discussed in the GB supplement.)
Excluding motor vehicles, we estimate that real nonfarm inventory investment
remained around $30 billion at an annual rate in the first quarter, close to the
subdued pace of late 1998. In the aggregate, stocks seem to be at fairly
comfortable levels--or perhaps even a bit lean. But the situation across sectors
is uneven: In retail trade, for example, the surge in sales in early 1999 probably
pushed inventories below desired levels, while the inventory-sales ratios for a
few manufacturing and wholesale trade categories remain high.
Using the book-value data, manufacturers' inventories fell $14 billion at an
annual rate in the first quarter, twice the drop recorded in the fourth quarter. A
steeper drop in inventories of aircraft and parts, a development related to the
decline in production at Boeing, accounted for almost all of the swing. The
inventory-shipments ratio for all manufacturing moved down in the first quarter,
with the aggregate ratio falling from 1.36 in December to 1.33 in March. The
decline was most pronounced for the primary metals industry, where the ratio
had risen appreciably last year; the ratios for chemicals and non-high-tech
machinery have also fallen during the past couple of months. However, even
with the recent declines, inventory-shipments ratios in these three industries
remain somewhat high relative to their historical levels.
Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of
$6-1/2 billion in the first quarter, about the same as in the fourth quarter. Last
quarter's increase was concentrated in durable goods, as accumulations in the
machinery and miscellaneous durables categories more than offset a drop in
5. Unpublished BEA data indicate that in 1997 (latest available data), manufacturers
accounted for 34 percent of all outlays on equipment in the non-high-tech, nontransportation
category--compared, for instance, with only 15 percent of all outlays for computers and
6 percent for communications equipment.

stocks of metals and minerals. The overall inventory-sales ratio for wholesalers
(excluding motor vehicles) plummeted in March, returning to about the levels of
the first half of 1998. The ratio for metals and minerals, which had jumped in
the second half of last year, fell sharply in the first quarter, while the ratios for
chemicals and machinery remained around the elevated levels of late 1998.
Non-auto retail inventories posted sizable increases over the first two months of
the year, accumulating at an average pace of $18 billion at an annual rate in
book-value terms. Nonetheless, the extraordinary strength of retail sales
through February meant that stockbuilding in most sectors failed to match the
gains in sales, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector as a whole fell to its
lowest level since 1980. The inventory-sales ratios for general merchandise and
apparel outlets posted especially dramatic declines.
Federal Government
Real federal expenditures on consumption and gross investment, as measured in
the NIPAs, declined at an annual rate of 3/4 percent in the first quarter. Real
defense expenditures fell at a 4-1/4 percent rate, somewhat faster than the
downward trend of the past few years. Nondefense purchases rose at a
6-1/4 percent rate, reflecting a surge in equipment investment resulting from the
acquisition of a large number of new motor vehicles.
The federal budget surplus over the twelve months ended in March, adjusted for
payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance, spectrum auction
proceeds, and sales of major assets, was $75 billion, compared with
$2-1/2 billion over the twelve months ended in March 1998. Outlays
accelerated somewhat in March. In particular, defense spending was almost
13 percent above the level recorded in March of last year. The increase in
defense expenditures predated the military action in Kosovo and, as far as we
know, was unrelated to it. However, defense spending is very volatile, and the
cumulative level of spending over the twelve months ended in March was only
0.6 percent higher than over the preceding twelve months. Spending on a
variety of other programs also grew substantially in March. The notable
exception was Medicare expenditures, which continued to run below year-earlier
levels.
Individual income tax receipts continue to be strong. Withheld individual
income and payroll taxes in March were well above the level of March of last
year, even after accounting for an extra business day in March 1999. In
addition, daily Treasury Statements for April and early May indicate that
nonwithheld income and self-employed payroll taxes (which include both final
payments on 1998 liability and estimated taxes for the first quarter of 1999)

were about $15-1/2 billion higher than last year.6 Income tax refunds have also
grown substantially. Thus far this tax season, refunds--including the portion of
the earned income tax credit included in outlays--are about $18 billion higher
than last year; this increase is largely attributable to the effects of the child tax
credit that became effective in 1998. The March Monthly Treasury Statement
and the April and early May Daily Treasury Statements indicate that corporate
tax receipts have been relatively weak.
The incoming tax data, along with last year's withheld and estimated tax
payments, can be used to construct a reasonable estimate of 1998 individual
income tax liability. Total personal income tax liability on 1998 income now
appears to be roughly 10 percent above last year's level, considerably above
estimates of nominal income growth. Thus, the trend of increasing effective
personal income tax rates that has been observed over the past three years
appears to have continued in 1998.
State and Local Government
We estimate that real purchases by state and local governments rose at an annual
rate of 7-3/4 percent in the first quarter, the largest quarterly advance in almost
fifteen years. Real outlays for investment (taking into account the March
construction data, which BEA did not have at the time of the advance GDP
estimate) jumped at about a 30 percent annual rate because of a surge in
highway and bridge construction in the western part of the country; in particular,
Utah has a major building program under way in preparation for the winter
Olympics scheduled for February 2002, including the repair of a 17-mile stretch
of highway that includes 144 bridges. With the weather unusually favorable
during the first quarter, highway work could proceed without the usual winter
slowdown, further boosting the seasonally adjusted figures. State and local
government employment rose 31,000 in April, just a bit below the first-quarter
pace.
Labor Costs
The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers
increased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent over the three months ended in March.
6. In its Monthly Budget Review released on May 7, CBO indicated that fiscal year 1999
revenues through April were very close to its expectations while outlays were slightly lower
than anticipated. Accordingly, CBO will not revise its projection of a $111 billion surplus for
fiscal 1999 at this time. However, CBO also noted that if current trends continue, it may
increase the surplus estimate slightly when it issues its summer update in July. (In the spring of
both 1997 and 1998, CBO indicated that its official budget projections were much too low
because it had greatly underpredicted the increase in nonwitheld taxes, and it issued interim
projections with much higher surpluses.)

This figure was held down notably by a sharp drop in compensation in the
finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) industry, but compensation in several
other industries decelerated significantly as well. Over the past twelve months,
the ECI for compensation increased 3 percent--down 3/4 percentage point from
its recent peak last September.
Part of the recent deceleration probably reflects the influence of restrained price
inflation in tempering nominal wage increases. But beyond that, about half of
the deceleration stems from a reversal of the surge in wage gains in the FIRE
industry. The surge appeared to have been driven by commissions associated
with the sharply rising levels of activity in the industry. Similarly, the first-
quarter drop in the ECI for the industry was most pronounced in sales
occupations, suggesting that commissions were important in that decline as well.
And, indeed, there have been independent indications that activity may have
eased in these areas: Mortgage refinancings dropped sharply in the first quarter
after having spiked last fall, and home sales have nearly leveled off.
Nevertheless, the first-quarter decline in compensation in the FIRE industry
seems larger than can be explained by such a slowdown in activity, and we
would not be surprised to see some offset in the coming quarters.
Another factor contributing to the deceleration in the ECI in the first quarter was
a sharp plunge in nonproduction bonuses. (Details on these and other benefits in
the ECI--with the exception of health care costs--are confidential.) Unlike the
size of commissions, which is largely fixed by a formula related to an
individual's production, the size of nonproduction bonuses is affected by
managerial discretion; these bonuses are recorded in the ECI as a benefit cost.
Although last year's weak profits performance may well have depressed first-
quarter bonus payments, anecdotal evidence does not support anything like the
sharp decline in bonuses reported in the ECI. Thus, we suspect that the decrease
may have been exaggerated.
Among other benefits captured by the ECI, health insurance costs rose
appreciably last quarter, increasing nearly 8 percent at an annual rate. The rise
brought the twelve-month change to 3-3/4 percent in March, up from
2-1/4 percent a year earlier. Anecdotal reports had pointed to rising health
insurance premiums this year, and we expect the twelve-month change to move
up further as more policies are renewed over the course of the year.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector--as reported in the
Productivity and Costs release--has been rising more rapidly than the ECI,
although it, too, has shown hints of deceleration lately. In the first quarter,
compensation per hour increased at a 4.3 percent annual rate, bringing the four-
quarter change to 4.1 percent--down from 4-1/2 percent last summer. The ECI

and nonfarm compensation per hour differ not only in that the ECI measures
costs for a fixed industry/occupation structure, but also in that the two measures
are constructed using fundamentally different sources and methods. Nonfarm
compensation per hour is somewhat broader in scope than the ECI; it includes,
for example, payments such as hiring bonuses and stock option exercises. In
addition, the early estimates of nonfarm compensation per hour are often revised
substantially as source data become available.
Regarding the first-quarter figures, the estimation procedures for nonfarm
compensation per hour would not have picked up the sharp drop in
nonproduction bonuses that was indicated by the ECI; the drop may show up
eventually, however, if it is reflected in the 1999 unemployment insurance
records, which will become available next year. Movements in commissions
earned by supervisory workers also would not get into the nonfarm
compensation data immediately. However, commissions earned by
nonsupervisory workers, as well as regular wage and salary changes, ought to
have been captured in average hourly earnings and thus reflected right away in
the nonfarm compensation data. Indeed, in the first quarter, average hourly
earnings increased much more rapidly than its closest counterpart in the ECI--
the series measuring wages and salaries of production or nonsupervisory
workers.
In all, probably only a small part of the difference between the first-quarter
readings of these two labor cost indicators can be attributed to clear differences
in scope or data availability; most of the difference simply reflects the fact that
they provide two independent readings on labor costs. We view the two
measures as complementary and interpret the recent nonfarm business data as a
caution that firms' actual labor costs, although decelerating, may be rising more
rapidly than is being measured by the ECI.
Information on labor costs this quarter is mostly limited to the BLS monthly
data on average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which
increased 0.2 percent in April. Over the past twelve months, average hourly
earnings increased 3.2 percent, down from 4.4 percent over the previous
twelve-month period. The deceleration was fairly widespread across industries,
with the largest slowdowns in wholesale and retail trade and in finance,
insurance, and real estate.
Prices
(The CPI report for April will be released tomorrow and will be discussed in the
GB supplement.)
Consumer price inflation remained low through March, although the April CPI
is expected to be lifted appreciably by a sharp increase in energy prices.

Excluding food and energy items, the CPI increased just 0.1 percent in each of
the first three months of the year. Over the twelve months to March, the core
CPI increased 2.1 percent, the same as over the year-earlier period. The overall
CPI is up only 1.7 percent over the past twelve months, reflecting the decline in
energy prices through early this year.
Because of seasonal adjustment difficulties, the CPI data through March appear
to have slightly exaggerated the low rate of inflation of late. In January, the
BLS began to use a geometric-means aggregation formula, rather than a fixed-
weight Laspeyres formula, at the finest level of aggregation of price quotes.7
But in adjusting the new data for seasonal variation, BLS used the seasonal
patterns of the old, Laspeyres indexes. BLS has been calculating geometric-
mean CPIs on an experimental basis since 1991, and according to those data, the
geometric-mean CPIs have a somewhat different seasonal pattern than do the
Laspeyres data. In particular, the geometric-mean series typically rise less
rapidly than the Laspeyres series in the first few months of the year, and rise
more rapidly later in the year. Our rough guess is that had BLS utilized the
experimental geometric-means data to generate their seasonal factors--as seems
to us to be the appropriate procedure--the twelve-month changes in the overall
and core CPIs would have been roughly 0.1 percentage point higher in March.8
Having said that, even adding a tenth or so to the most recent twelve-month
change, and taking into account other modifications in CPI methodology, the
core CPI has accelerated only about 1/4 percentage point from a year ago, and
the December surge in tobacco prices can fully account for this pickup.
Excluding tobacco, goods prices have declined over the past twelve months.
The CPI for new motor vehicles was down 0.7 percent over the twelve months
to March, the same as over the preceding twelve months. Apparel prices were
reported as having declined 1.6 percent over the past twelve months (although
this series is one for which the seasonal adjustment difficulties discussed above
likely held down the first-quarter index by a considerable amount). At the same
time, the prices of non-energy services have decelerated slightly over the past
twelve months.
7 In contrast to the Laspeyres formula, the geometric-means formula assumes that
consumers make some degree of substitution in their consumption choices in response to
changes in relative prices.
8. Although these effects are difficult to pin down, we estimate that the published data
understate the true seasonally adjusted increase in the CPI from December to March by about
0.3 percentage point at an annual rate.

As with prices of core goods and services, food prices have been restrained
recently. The CPI for food increased only 0.1 percent per month, on average, in
the first quarter. Over the twelve months to March, the CPI for food rose
2.3 percent, about 1/4 percentage point more than over the preceding twelve
months. Spot crop prices have been moving down lately as well.
In contrast, consumer energy prices have rebounded sharply after declining
substantially last year. The CPI for energy declined nearly 9 percent over 1998
and was little changed in January and February, but it jumped 1-1/2 percent in
March, reflecting a 3-1/2 percent rise in gasoline prices. We expect to see even
larger increases in consumer energy prices in April: The PPI for energy goods
soared, and survey evidence points to a steep rise in retail gasoline and heating
oil prices as well. These price movements stem both from the run-up we have
seen in crude oil prices over the past couple of months and from disruptions at
three refineries in California. Barring further increases in crude oil prices, the
rise in the CPI for energy should have about run its course by now; this is borne
out by survey evidence showing about flat gasoline prices in early May.
Outside of the energy area, there are few direct signs of inflationary pressures
coming from earlier stages of processing. As noted above, food commodity
prices have been declining in recent weeks. Outside of the food and energy
area, the PPI for core intermediate materials moved up in April but is down
1-1/2 percent over the past twelve months. The PPI for core crude materials has
dropped nearly 13 percent over the past year. However, since late March, spot
prices of many industrial commodities have risen notably, especially for some
metals and building materials. These increases likely are due to greater
optimism about prospects for a strengthening of activity in Asia and Latin
America as well as to the boom in construction activity in the United States. In
all, the Journal of Commerce industrial price index has risen 1-1/2 percent since
the last Greenbook.
As has been the case for some time, broader price indexes have continued to rise
less rapidly than the CPI. The GDP chain price index rose 1 percent over the
four quarters ended in the first quarter of 1999, about 1/4 percentage point less
than the increase over the preceding four quarters. GDP prices have been held
down, relative to consumption prices, by unusually sharp declines in the prices
of investment goods. In the first quarter, however, prices of producers' durable
equipment declined at only a 2-3/4 percent annual rate, compared with a nearly
5 percent rate of decline in 1998. Much of that difference reflects a slowing in
the rate of decline in computer prices from nearly 29 percent last year to
21 percent in the first quarter. Whether this more moderate pace will continue is
unclear: The PPI for computers fell 4 percent in April.

Because GDP includes the government, nonprofit, and household sectors of the
economy, it often is useful to focus on the nonfarm business sector (excluding
housing). In this sector, prices have been even more restrained than for overall
GDP, rising only 0.4 percent over the past four quarters. The deceleration of
nonfarm business prices, other things equal, has exerted downward pressure on
the markup of prices over unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector. At the
same time, the markup has been buoyed by rapid productivity growth, which
helped to restrain growth in unit labor costs. In the end, the behavior of the
markup over the past year has been mixed: When measured using nonfarm
compensation per hour, the markup was well above its long-term average in
early 1998, came down a good bit last year, and has only moved up slightly with
the recent surge in productivity. This reduction in the markup hints that
businesses will be less able to absorb further cost increases going forward than
they have in the past couple of years. When measured using the ECI, the
markup also came down last year; but it rebounded in the past couple of quarters
as the ECI slowed, and in the first quarter it stood well above its long-run
average.
Looking ahead, according to the Michigan survey, median one-year-ahead
inflation expectations were 2.7 percent in April, up a tad from first-quarter levels
and 1/4 percentage point higher than readings from the latter part of last year.
Longer-term inflation expectations have remained low, however, with both the
Michigan SRC's median five-to-ten-year inflation expectations and the
Philadelphia Fed's survey of professional forecasters' ten-year expectations
continuing to show expected inflation below 3 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Yields on Treasury securities have risen, on net, since the March FOMC
meeting, as early enthusiasm that the pace of economic expansion might be
slowing gave way to concern that policy tightening would be needed before
long. In the first week or so after the FOMC meeting, a weak March
employment report, combined with unanticipated easings in monetary policy
abroad, contributed to sizable declines in Treasury rates. Since then, yields have
more than reversed those declines, as investors read the strength in economic
data releases and concerns expressed by Chairman Greenspan about tightening
labor markets as suggesting that policy might firm somewhat over the next year.
However, with profits strong and investors showing increased tolerance for risk,
yields on corporate debt have risen less than those on Treasuries and, indeed,
yields on lower-rated junk bonds have declined.
Robust corporate profits outweighed the effect of rising Treasury bond yields to
boost the Wilshire 5000 index--the broadest measure of U.S. equity prices--more
than 5 percent over the intermeeting period. Shares of cyclical and primary
industry companies gained considerably more than that, as did shares of smaller
firms; concerns about earnings prospects in the high-tech sector restrained the
gains for those stocks and cooled enthusiasm a bit for Internet shares.
Meanwhile, gross issuance of both seasoned equity offerings and IPOs has been
strong.
Business and household borrowing has remained robust. Corporate borrowing
has been focused on the bond market in recent months, as favorable market
conditions have encouraged firms to lock in long-term funding in lieu of shorter-
maturity bank loans and commercial paper. Growth of consumer credit cooled
in March from its sizzling pace earlier in the year but still advanced rapidly for
the first quarter as a whole, and home mortgage borrowing remained brisk as
well last quarter. State and local governments continued to issue a sizable
volume of debt to fund new capital. In contrast, the Treasury has been paying
down debt as a result of the surplus, which has been growing.
Growth of M2 and M3 picked up in April after a soft March. Some of the
strength in M2 was apparently attributable to a transitory rise in liquid accounts
associated with larger-than-normal tax payments and refunds; these accounts fell
back in late April when tax payments cleared. Bank credit was flat in April, as
loan expansion was held down by securitization and banks continued to run off
mortgage-backed securities acquired last fall when spreads widened.
Business Finance
Investor demand for corporate bonds has been strong, and yield spreads
narrowed further over the intermeeting period. The improvement in spreads was

especially pronounced for below-investment-grade issues, as yields actually fell
on lower-rated junk bonds. Firms have taken advantage of the favorable market
conditions: Gross nonfinancial bond issuance totaled a hefty $30 billion in
April, following the record issuance of $39-1/2 billion in March. Moreover, the
calendar of forthcoming issues is bulging. Although most of the proceeds have
been employed to pay down existing debt, in April, a large share also was used
for mergers and other corporate restructurings. The speculative-grade segment
of the market demonstrated considerable breadth in April, with offerings
including a number of smaller issues and some industries--energy and oil
producers, for example--that had been largely absent from the market since last
fall. With firms turning to the bond market for funds, net issuance of
commercial paper was fairly light in March and April, and growth in business
loans at banks was subdued.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations totaled $7-1/2 billion in
April, slightly above the already brisk first-quarter pace. Seasoned offerings
were unusually robust and were concentrated in Internet-related and telecom
firms. Internet-related IPOs continue to meet with exceptionally strong demand,
including, importantly, demand from on-line retail investors, and such IPOs have
accounted for about half of the total number of offerings this year. The long-
anticipated IPO by Goldman Sachs, which raised $3.7 billion in early May, was
also well received, with its stock price rising more than 30 percent on its first
day of trading.
Equity retirements associated with mergers were weak in April, as they were in
the first quarter, reflecting the small number of cash-financed megamergers (as
opposed to stock swaps) that have closed since year-end. Announcements of
new mergers continue to be numerous, however, and, relative to the first quarter,
these deals will involve more cash payments to retire the equity of acquired
companies. Nonetheless, the list of deals pending completion suggests that
merger-related cash demands in 1999 will fall below the high level in 1998.
Meanwhile, announcements of share repurchases have remained strong in recent
months, though below last year's record pace.
Credit quality in the corporate business sector has continued to show some signs
of deterioration. The default rate on junk bonds picked up considerably in April,
boosted by defaults by several energy and health care firms. The average default
rate over the past twelve months moved above its levels of recent years, and a
simple forecasting model predicts that the default rate in 1999 will be more than

double the level in 1998.1 Business failures also increased in the first quarter
and in April they jumped to about twice the recent monthly pace; however, the
failure rate over the past twelve months is still below the annual average since
1990. In addition, bonds of nonfinancial firms, on net, have been downgraded
by Moody's through April of this year. Firms in the oil and gas and health care
sectors have accounted for a large portion of the failures and downgrades since
year-end. Looking ahead, Moody's Watchlist suggests little further deterioration
in the near term, as the dollar volume of debt on review for upgrades and
downgrades is roughly balanced.
First-quarter corporate earnings have come in strong and well above
expectations. With 90 percent of reports in hand, S&P 500 book earnings per
share are estimated to have risen at least 6 percent from four quarters earlier, in
marked contrast to the 2-1/2 percent drop in the fourth quarter.2 Earnings of
financial firms picked up substantially, fully recovering from the falloff in the
second half of 1998; the renewed strength largely reflected the surge in capital
market activity and trading income. Earnings for the technology sector also
accelerated in the first quarter, from already large gains in the previous quarter.
The profits of other nonfinancial firms were up about 4 percent, on balance,
from a year earlier, an improvement over their fourth-quarter performance.
The magnitude of the positive earnings surprises helped propel the DJIA, the
S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ composite to new highs, though the
NASDAQ has since edged down from its peak. Share price indexes of firms
producing primary commodities and industrial machinery have risen between
16 percent and 30 percent over this period, helping to boost the DJIA 10 percent.
Share prices for a broad range of smaller companies also moved up sharply,
lifting the Russell 2000 index about 12 percent. In contrast, the technology-
heavy NASDAQ composite increased less than 5 percent, on net, amid high
volatility. Prices of Internet stocks, which by some measures now account for
about one-quarter of the NASDAQ,3 gyrated wildly but are up slightly since the
March FOMC meeting and up about 55 percent on the year. The market rally
1. Inputs to the model are the rating distribution of outstanding bonds, the percentage of
banks tightening loan underwriting standards, and aggregate default rate predictions from a
private sector model that forecasts firms' default probabilities on the basis of their outstanding
debt, asset values, and asset volatility.
2. A measure of earnings per share that accounts for changes in the composition of firms
included in the S&P 500 index increased about 8 percent in the first quarter from the year-
earlier level.
3. This estimate is based on the market value of the fifty companies in the Inter@ctive
Week Internet index, all of whose principal line of business is tied to the Internet. America
Online, the only company in the index for Internet stocks that is traded on the NYSE, is
excluded from the share calculation for NASDAQ.

among the "cyclical" stocks pushed the S&P 500 twelve-month forward
earnings-price ratio down to a record low in April, as stock price gains outpaced
upward revisions to expected earnings.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Commercial mortgage lending was robust in the first quarter, with banks
apparently gaining market share at the expense of conduits. An estimate based
on data from large domestic banks indicates that banks' holdings of commercial
mortgage loans expanded in the first quarter at a 13 percent annual rate. In
contrast, gross issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities fell to
$16 billion in the first quarter, from $23 billion in the fourth quarter of 1998. As
the stock of commercial mortgages originated last year that have yet to be
securitized has shrunk, and with fewer new conduit loan originations occurring
this year, many analysts predict further declines in CMBS issuance. Spreads
across all risk classes of CMBSs were little changed over the intermeeting
period and remain elevated compared with a year ago, especially for the lowest-
rated tranches.
Share prices for real estate investment trusts have surged nearly 13-1/2 percent
since the last FOMC meeting, breaking the downward trend in place since late
1997. The recent rally followed the widely publicized announcement that
Warren Buffett had made sizable investments in REITs. Despite this rally, a
broad index of REIT prices is still more than 20 percent below its peak in late
1997. With REIT share prices still relatively low, issuance of new equities by
REITs remains weak and property acquisitions have been modest.
Household Finances
The ratio of household net worth to disposable income edged up to a new record
in the first quarter, boosted by robust stock market gains. Net purchases of
equity mutual funds picked up in the first quarter and strengthened further in
April, suggesting renewed household interest in riskier investments. Inflows
into equity funds are estimated to have been $23 billion in April, comparable to
the strong inflows in the first half of 1998. Domestic equity funds received the
bulk of these investments, but net flows to international equity funds turned
positive for only the second month since last July. Investments in bond funds
diminished in April, probably because of some substitution into equity funds and
perhaps also because of some shareholders making withdrawals to pay taxes.
However, inflows into junk bond funds were still appreciable, at $1-1/4 billion
in April.
Households with 401(k) plans also tended to show a greater willingness to invest
in equity funds. In April, new 401(k) contributions to company stock and equity
funds accounted for three-quarters of total contributions, up from an average

pace of about two-thirds of contributions over the past year. Transfers of
existing 401(k) assets in April, which totaled 2 percent of account balances,
were primarily out of company stock and into more diversified equity and fixed
income funds.
Household debt growth, although erratic from month to month, was brisk in the
first quarter. Growth in consumer credit picked up to nearly 8 percent at an
annual rate for the quarter as a whole, although growth was markedly slower in
March than in January. Results from the May Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey indicate a slightly firmer stance toward credit card lending with a net
16 percent of banks tightening standards for credit cards. However, terms for
credit cards and other consumer loans were essentially unchanged. Issuance of
asset-backed securities--which has been an important source of financing for
consumer credit in recent years--totaled $65 billion in the first quarter, capping
the highest quarterly level of securitizations since the second quarter of 1998.
After narrowing in January and February, spreads on asset-backed securities
were relatively stable through April, but they remain 20 to 30 basis points wider
than a year ago.
On the basis of incomplete data, it appears that home mortgage debt expanded
vigorously in the first quarter, albeit down a bit from the previous quarter.
Strong home sales undergirded this growth. Looking beyond the first quarter,
the Mortgage Bankers Association purchase index has risen in recent weeks,
suggesting that borrowing will remain robust in the near term. The MBA
mortgage refinancing index edged up in April but is well below the peaks
reached last fall, as the rise in rates during the first quarter discouraged
refinancings.
Recent indicators of household credit quality have been roughly stable.
Moody's reported that the delinquency rate on securitized credit card receivables
continued to edge down in February and March but remained above the low
levels reached in 1995. The delinquency rate at auto finance companies also
declined slightly in March.
On May 5, the House passed bankruptcy reform legislation that seeks to shift
some households from chapter 7, under which most unsecured debts are forgiven
outright, to chapter 13, under which debtors must file a repayment plan. The
households affected by this portion of the legislation are those earning more than
the median income of the United States who can afford to make more than
$6,000 in payments toward unsecured debt over five years. The Senate is
expected to consider a similar bill next month. Even if the final bill is close to
the House version, it is unlikely to have a major influence on the growth of
household debt. It would directly affect only an estimated 0.2 percent of all

households, who would be required to switch to chapter 13 each year under the
proposed rules. Furthermore, it is not even clear whether the indirect effects on
other households and lenders would tend, on net, to boost or lower the growth of
consumer credit. Households may reduce their demand for credit as bankruptcy
becomes less attractive, but lenders may increase the supply of credit as their
expected losses from bankruptcy diminish.
Treasury and Agency Finance
Erratic inflows of individual non-withheld tax receipts, which are typical at this
time of year, led to wide fluctuations in the Treasury cash balance in April.
Early receipts were lower than expected, forcing the Treasury to issue a one-day
cash management bill and to increase the size of its weekly bill auctions
$1 billion. A subsequent surge in receipts pushed Treasury cash balances
sharply higher and increased cumulative tax inflows well above last year's
levels. Amid these fluctuations, the Treasury decided to leave the size of its
April two-year note auction unchanged at $15 billion but cut the size of its April
auction of inflation-protected securities $1 billion, issuing $7 billion of a new
thirty-year inflation-protected bond. This issue brought the total outstandings of
TIPS to $84 billion, or 3-1/4 percent of all marketable Treasury coupon
securities. Demand was weak at the Treasury's midquarter refunding auction of
$15 billion of five-year notes and $12 billion of ten-year notes, and yields at
these maturities rose to their highest levels in nearly a year.
Trading volume in the Treasury market has remained light, but a recent survey
of dealers indicates that liquidity conditions have continued to improve. Bid-
offer spreads for on-the-run securities have returned to their levels of last
summer, and those for off-the-run securities remain slightly elevated only for
maturities of more than five years. However, price premiums, though
diminished, persist on some Treasury securities, particularly the on-the-run ten-
year Treasury note, which has been used to hedge the sizable volume of
corporate and mortgage-backed security issuance.
Government-sponsored enterprises have continued to issue debt in large,
uniform blocks in an effort to establish their securities as alternative benchmarks
as Treasury issuance declines. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home
Loan Banks all have issued global bonds in recent months; outstandings of
Fannie Mae's current five-year benchmark note total $13 billion, more than for
any other non-Treasury security in the debt markets. The flight to safety of last
fall has continued to unwind, and spreads between GSE benchmark securities
and Treasuries narrowed about 8 basis points over the intermeeting period,
though they remain slightly elevated relative to the first half of 1998.

Municipal Finance
Gross long-term municipal bond issuance totaled $15-3/4 billion in April, down
from the strong first-quarter pace. Advance refundings fell to $5-1/4 billion in
April; issuers have refunded much of the stock of eligible outstanding high-
coupon bonds, and refundings are likely to taper off further unless interest rates
fall. New capital issuance also declined significantly, but the number of issues
on the calendar suggests that volumes will pick up again in coming weeks.
Funds raised in April were largely targeted for education and transportation, as
has been the case of late.
Yields on long-dated municipal bonds have been stable for some time. The rise
in Treasury rates over the intermeeting period, however, has led to a further
decline in yield ratios from their record highs last fall. In addition, credit quality
continued to improve in April. Standard & Poor's posted twenty-one upgrades
of municipal bonds, versus only six downgrades. Many state and local
governments have improved the quality of their credits by using recent surpluses
to create "rainy day funds."
Money and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates advanced briskly in April after a weak March.
M2 grew at a 8-3/4 percent annual rate, buoyed by a surge in money market
mutual funds and liquid deposits. Swings in tax payments and refunds often
have caused gyrations in April, and it is likely that efforts by households to build
up their liquid balances in advance of tax payments, which have been larger than
in recent years, accounted for a significant part of the rise last month. Currency
also increased smartly, apparently buoyed by strong demand for domestic use.
M2 velocity edged down in the first quarter, continuing its trend of the past year
and a half.
M3 expanded at an 8 percent annual rate in April after falling in March. M3 was
boosted in April by a substantial increase in large time deposits, and by a
rebound in institution-only money market mutual funds, which--following the
usual pattern--experienced inflows when short-term interest rates dipped
temporarily. Repurchase agreements continued to contract in April, although by
less than in March.
Bank credit was about flat in April, after declining over the three prior months.
Growth in April was held down by a continuing reversal of the fourth-quarter
surge in banks' securities holdings. Last month, banks again unloaded securities
they had accumulated last fall, when relatively high yields on mortgage-backed
and other non-Treasury securities apparently made them unusually attractive. By
contrast, most categories of loans showed small increases. Commercial and

industrial loans, which had contracted earlier in the year after having grown
rapidly in the fourth quarter, posted their second month of modest gains,
increasing at a 2-1/4 percent pace in April. Results from the May Senior Loan
Officer Survey indicate only a slight further tightening of terms and standards
for C&I loans over the past three months--certainly nothing to suggest a material
crimp on credit supply. Real estate loans were flat in April, held down by
securitizations, although the home equity component grew at a 9-3/4 percent
clip. Consumer loans originated by banks increased at a 4-3/4 percent rate, well
above the pace seen earlier this year.
The fifty largest commercial bank holding companies experienced solid growth
in net income in the first quarter. Noninterest income, particularly trading
income and investment banking fees, grew markedly, but net interest margins
were about unchanged from year-earlier levels. Asset quality again contributed
positively to the net increase, as both provisioning for loan losses and the
percentage of non-performing assets remained low.

Appendix
May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices
The May 1999 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices again
focused on changes over the past three months in the supply of and demand for bank
loans to businesses and households. A substantial set of additional questions, some of
which were also asked in either the May or the November 1998 survey, concerned Year
2000 issues.
In general, the tightening of standards and terms for business loans in evidence since
the fall of 1998 has eased considerably. As in the most recent survey, in January, only
a few domestic banks, on net, reported having tightened credit standards for
commercial and industrial loans. Credit terms, which in recent surveys had been
reported tightened, were reported generally unchanged, with the exception of risk
premiums, which were again increased. The number of branches and agencies of
foreign banks reporting tightened lending standards and terms for commercial and
industrial loans was much lower than in recent surveys. Few banks, domestic or
foreign, reported increased demand for commercial and industrial loans from large and
middle-market firms, but some domestic banks reported increased demand from smaller
firms.
For commercial real estate loans, standards were reported to have been tightened, but
by a smaller fraction of both domestic and foreign banks than in recent surveys;
demand for these loans was up at some domestic banks but little changed, on net, at
foreign banks.
A number of banks indicated that they had tightened credit card lending standards.
However, few had changed credit standards for other consumer loans, or terms on
consumer loans of all types. Demand for consumer loans was reported to have
increased since the most recent survey.
Most domestic and foreign respondents indicated that customer Year 2000
preparedness is part of their loan underwriting, review, and documentation processes.
Banks have begun Year 2000 compliance reviews for a substantially larger share of
their customers than in the fall, but many banks have not yet completed their reviews.
Similarly, banks reported substantial progress in the preparedness of those customers
they have evaluated, but a number of customers were said to be lagging. Still, most
banks have downgraded relatively few customers because of inadequate Year 2000
preparedness.
Respondents, domestic and foreign, reported little demand to date for special
contingency lines of credit related to Year 2000, but many expected demand for such
lines to increase somewhat as the year progresses. Almost all domestic respondents,
but fewer than half the foreign ones, reported that they are willing to extend such credit
lines, although in some cases with tighter standards or terms. Responses also indicated
that lines of credit that are up for renewal and will extend beyond year-end have been

III-A-2
little affected by Year 2000 concerns at domestic banks but face tighter standards and
terms at branches and agencies of foreign banks.
Lending to Businesses
About 10 percent of domestic respondents reported having tightened lending standards
for large, middle-market, and small firms over the past three months, a slight uptick
from the January survey.' However, the general tightening of lending terms that had
been apparent in recent surveys was absent in May, except for increased premiums on
riskier loans, which were reported, on net, by one-fifth of domestic banks. Branches
and agencies of foreign banks continued to report tightened credit standards and terms
on commercial and industrial loans in larger proportions than domestic banks, but in
fewer numbers than in previous surveys. About a quarter of the foreign respondents
indicated that they had tightened standards; more than 40 percent reported higher
charges for credit lines, wider spreads of loan rates over the bank's cost of funds, and
increased premiums on riskier loans. Those domestic and foreign banks reporting
tighter standards or terms cited as key reasons a reduced tolerance for risk, industry-
specific problems, or a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook.
Evidence of demand for commercial and industrial loans at domestic banks was mixed:
On net, no banks reported a change in demand from large and middle-market firms,
whereas approximately 20 percent, on net, had reported stronger demand in the January
survey; 10 percent, on net, reported increased demand from small firms, about the same
as in January. Banks pointed to changes in customers' merger and acquisition
financing, plant and equipment purchases, and borrowing from other lending sources as
important reasons for changes in loan demand. Branches and agencies of foreign banks
characterized loan demand as little changed, on balance.
Credit standards on commercial real estate loans were tightened by 5 percent of
domestic respondents, on net, down from 15 percent in the January survey. About
14 percent, on net, reported increased demand for commercial real estate loans, down
from 30 percent in January. Only a few branches and agencies reported having
tightened standards on commercial real estate loans, and demand for these loans was
reported to have been essentially unchanged. In the January survey, more than half of
these banks, on net, reported having tightened standards for these loans, while a
quarter, on net, reported increased demand for these loans.
Lending to Households
About 13 percent of banks reported increased willingness to extend consumer
installment loans, about the same as in recent surveys. In contrast, standards for credit
card loans were tightened by about 18 percent of respondents, somewhat more than in
the January survey. However, terms for credit card loans, which were tightened by
some banks in January, were reported as essentially unchanged in May.
A few banks reported having tightened credit standards for consumer loans other than
credit card loans, reversing the small net easing reported in the January survey.
1. Figures that are net are so reported.

III-A-3
Demand for consumer loans of all types increased at 15 percent of respondent banks,
on net, up from January. Credit standards for home mortgage loans were reported as
unchanged, while about 7 percent of respondents, on net, reported increased demand
for home mortgages, about the same as in January.
Year 2000
Virtually all respondents reported that they include Year 2000 preparedness as part of
their underwriting or loan review standards and documentation, and more than a
quarter of domestic, and a smaller percentage of foreign, respondents reported having
rejected at least a few loan applications because of inadequate Year 2000 preparedness
of the applicant. The rejection percentages for each banking group was about double
that reported in the May 1998 survey.
About 75 percent of domestic respondents and all foreign respondents said they include
Year 2000 covenants, conditions, representations, or warranties in loan documentation
for at least some loans to customers not already Year 2000 compliant, up from
40 percent (domestic respondents) and 35 percent (foreign respondents) in May 1998.2
Only 9 percent of domestic banks reported that they had evaluated fewer than 75
percent of their material business customers for Year 2000 preparedness, down from 15
percent in November and 88 percent a year ago.3 Just over half of domestic
respondents and almost three-quarters of foreign respondents had evaluated 95 percent
or more of these customers. Two-thirds of domestic banks, up from one-half in
November, reported that fewer than 5 percent of their material customers were making
unsatisfactory progress on preparedness. About 15 percent reported unsatisfactory
progress at 10 percent or more of these customers. The foreign responses with respect
to customer preparedness were similar.
A subset of the Year 2000 questions addressed the issues of demand for and supply of
credit that will extend beyond year-end. Banks reported very little demand to date for
new credit lines or extensions of existing credit lines that are specifically related to
firms' Year 2000 contingency preparation (Year 2000 contingency lines of credit), but
many expect to receive a moderate number of such requests. What demand banks have
seen is in large part from other banks. About half of domestic banks were willing to
extend Year 2000 contingency lines of credit to both new and existing customers, and
all but a few of the remaining respondents were willing to make such lines available to
existing customers. By contrast, three-fifths of foreign respondents were unwilling to
extend these loans, and none were willing to extend them to new customers.
2. At least part of the increase may be due to more inclusive wording of the question in
response to comments from respondents the last time it was used. Specifically, the May 1998
survey asked only about covenants, with no mention of conditions, representations, or
warranties.
3. A material business customer is one that represents a material risk as indicated, for
example, by the size of the overall relationship with the customer, the customer's risk rating, the
complexity of the customer's operating and information technology systems, and the degree of
the customer's reliance on these systems.

III-A-4
Those banks expressing reluctance or unwillingness to extend Year 2000 lines of credit
listed a variety of reasons, including concerns about the effects of additional lending on
capital ratios and concerns about repayment prospects related to Year 2000 effects on
customers. About 40 percent of domestic banks and about 65 percent of foreign banks
willing to extend Year 2000 contingency lines of credit indicated that these lines will
have tighter standards than other credits. Sixty-five percent of domestic banks willing
to extend these loans reported that they would be priced no differently than other loans.
The remaining third of respondents expected to charge a premium of 25 basis points or
less.4
Few domestic respondents expect to impose tighter standards and terms for credit-line
renewals that are not specifically meant to meet year-end funding needs but that would
extend beyond year-end. Many foreign respondents, by contrast, expect to impose
tighter loan standards and terms for such loans, including limited usage around year-
end.
More than half of domestic and foreign banks thought that actual usage of existing
lines of credit will be stronger than normal around year-end. Banks expected credit
demand to be boosted by increased financing needs for inventory or accounts
receivable and by market disruptions affecting borrowing elsewhere.
4. Those domestic banks reporting a willingness to extend Year 2000 contingency lines of
credit reported an average rate premium of 6.5 basis points (unweighted basis) and 4.5 basis
points (weighted basis). The average is computed using the median of the ranges of potential
premiums provided in the question. For the weighted basis, responses were weighted using
commercial and industrial loans outstanding.

Trade in Goods and Services
For January-February combined, the nominal U.S. trade deficit in goods and
services increased to nearly $218 billion, substantially larger than for any quarter
in 1998. Exports (especially goods) fell back to levels recorded in the second
and third quarters of last year, and imports rose strongly.

Exports fell 2-3/4 percent in January-February relative to the fourth quarter of
1998, nearly reversing the strong increase recorded in the fourth quarter. The
largest declines were in the values of exported aircraft, machinery, industrial
supplies, and agricultural products. Exports to countries in Asia generally turned
down in January-February from the peak levels in the fourth quarter that had
been boosted by record deliveries of aircraft to that region.
Imports were 1-1/2 percent higher in January-February than in the fourth quarter,
with large increases in consumer goods, automotive products, and computers
and semiconductors. These increases were only partly offset by declines in the
value of imported oil, steel, and aircraft; most of the decrease in the value of oil
was in price.
Quantity and price of imported oil. The quantity of imported oil increased
slightly in January-February, due to declines in domestic production and to
robust U.S. economic growth. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics
indicate that imports in March and April remained near January-February levels.

The price of imported oil fell 8 percent at an annual rate in January-February
combined, reflecting unseasonably warm weather, strong exports from Iraq, and
high levels of oil inventories. More recently, the average spot price of West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) increased markedly from about $12 per barrel in
February to $17.34 in April. This rapid run-up in prices was mostly fueled by
the March agreement of OPEC and non-OPEC producers to restrict production
by two million barrels per day, although weaker than expected inventories in the
United States and temporary supply disruptions have also contributed to higher
prices. Spot WTI is currently trading above $17.50 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Non-oil import prices fell during the
first quarter at nearly the same rate as in the previous quarter. Prices of "core"
imports (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) were about flat in
the first quarter, as declines in prices of imported industrial supplies and foods
were offset by increases in prices of imported machinery (other than computers
and semiconductors), automotive products, and consumer goods. Prices of
imported computers fell, and prices of imported semiconductors rose. Non-oil
import prices declined further in April. Prices of "core" goods imports declined
0.1 percent, as lower prices of imported industrial supplies, machinery, and
consumer goods were partly offset by higher prices for foods and automotive
products. Prices of imported computers and semiconductors fell substantially.
Prices of goods exports declined during the first quarter at a slightly smaller rate
than in the fourth quarter of last year. Prices of exported "core" goods (which
exclude agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors) were about flat,
as increases in prices of exported capital equipment and automotive products
about offset declines in prices of exported industrial supplies and consumer
goods. Prices of agricultural exports dropped again, as did prices of exported
computers and semiconductors. Export prices rose slightly in April. A swing
from decrease to increase was recorded for agricultural products and industrial
supplies. Prices of exported machinery (other than computers and
semiconductors) increased slightly, while price declines were recorded for
consumer goods, automotive products and computers.
Price data for May will be released on June 10.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased moderately in the first
quarter of 1999, with most of the increase coming in March (line 1 of the
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Saudi Arabian reserves
increased substantially, as last year's oil-related drawdowns were partially
restored. Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan also registered significant increases.
Argentinian and Brazilian reserves fell moderately, while Mexican reserves were
steady for the quarter. Acting on a stated intention to hold more official reserves
in the currencies of its non-U.S. trading partners, Singapore reduced its official
holdings in the United States throughout the quarter.
Private foreigners' net purchases of U.S. securities amounted to almost $50
billion in the first quarter, over half of the net purchases coming in March (line
4). Although substantial, the total was far below that of the fourth quarter. The
net inflow was more than accounted for by purchases of corporate and other
bonds (line 4b). With the spreads between corporate and Treasury bonds falling,
U.S. corporations responded by issuing huge amounts of domestic and
Eurobonds, particularly in March; preliminary data indicate that Eurobond sales
in April were almost as strong as in March. Foreign private holdings of U.S.
Treasury securities fell moderately (line 4a); net sales were dominated by hedge
funds in the Caribbean.
U.S. residents sold foreign stocks net throughout the first quarter (line 5b).
There were large net sales of European stocks. On the other hand, U.S. residents
made almost $9 billion in net purchases of Japanese stocks.
Banks registered moderate capital inflows for each month of the quarter (line 3).

Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period following the March FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange value
of the dollar declined 0.5 percent on a weighted average basis against the other
major currencies, primarily driven by a 3.6 percent depreciation against the
Canadian dollar and a 4.2 percent decline versus the Australian dollar.

These currencies were boosted by the recovery in commodity prices. The price
of industrial metals rose over 10 percent, oil rose 4 percent and lumber rose 9
percent. The price of gold also rose as much as 3 percent, but the rally was
completely reversed after the U.K. Treasury announced that it would be selling a
significant portion of U.K. gold reserves over the next few years. The Canadian
dollar firmed, even after the Bank of Canada twice cut its key bank rate, each
time by 25 basis points, lowering the effective overnight rate below that of the
federal funds target rate for the first time since last August.
The large disparity in growth rates between the U.S. economy and those in the
euro zone weighed on the euro. The Governing Council of the European Central
Bank reacted to the low euro-area growth rates, particularly in Germany and
Italy, by reducing its refinancing rate 50 basis points on April 8, more than the
market had expected. Once the euro weakened below $1.06, ECB officials and
euro-area finance ministers began a process of verbal intervention, expressing
concern over the value the euro if it were to fall much further and threatening to
take action should a further decline occur. During much of the intermeeting

IV-9
period movements in the euro against the dollar appear to have been tied to the
level of optimism on prospects for a near-term resolution to the armed conflict
between NATO and Serbia. On balance, the dollar appreciated 0.9 percent
versus the euro for the period.
The dollar moved within a fairly narrow range against the yen, appreciating 1.6
percent on balance, as the yield spread between U.S. and Japanese 10-year
bonds widened from 346 basis points to 411 basis points. The 10-year JGB
yield declined 53 basis points, and Japanese equities rallied, boosted by
optimism that the economy had bottomed and that substantial restructuring
would ensue.
Sterling has surprised market analysts by remaining strong against the dollar in
the face of an economy that has slowed markedly. The Bank of England
reported in the May Inflation Report that further easing may be necessary if the
trade-weighted value of sterling does not depreciate. On April 8 the Bank of
England cut its official repo rate 25 basis points, and since the March FOMC
meeting the pound has depreciated 0.2 percent versus the dollar.
Yields on 10-year bonds fell slightly in the euro area and the United Kingdom,
while they rose about 15 basis points in the United States and Canada.
The dollar dipped 1.6 percent versus the currencies of our other important
trading partners, due in large part to a 2.6 percent depreciation against the
Mexican peso. The Mexican peso was buoyed by the rise in oil prices and a
lower-than-expected inflation rate. In addition, the generally more optimistic
outlook on emerging economies has benefitted the Mexican peso and Mexican
equities, with the Bolsa up 21 percent. Brazilian markets also rallied, with the
dollar falling 7.2 percent versus the Brazilian real, even as the Brazilian central
bank lowered its overnight rate from 42 percent to 27 percent during the
intermeeting period. Yield spreads over Treasuries of Brazilian and Mexican
bonds have fallen sharply.

The performance of the stock markets of the emerging market economies in Asia
was impressive. Share prices in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia rose over 30
percent, while stocks in the Phillippines, Hong Kong and Korea gained more
than 20 percent. The yield spread of bonds in these countries over Treasuries
fell about 50 basis points as well. All the major floating currencies of emerging
Asia appreciated against the dollar, generally from 1 to 3 percent. Gaining much
more was the Indonesian rupiah, which appreciated 12 percent against the dollar.
An unwinding of the effects from a bout of domestic turmoil, which unsettled
Indonesian financial markets in the period before the March FOMC, helped
magnify the appreciation of the rupiah as well as the sharp rise in the Indonesia
stock market.
The Desk did not intervene during
the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic developments in recent months have confirmed that growth in most of
the major industrialized countries remains weak. In Japan, recent data releases
have provided scant evidence of a turnaround in economic fortunes, with private
consumption slumping further. In the euro area, real GDP declined in the fourth
quarter, with contractions in real activity in Germany and Italy only partially
offset by more robust economic performance in France. In the United Kingdom,
preliminary estimates show that economic growth in the first-quarter remained
unchanged from its meager fourth-quarter rate, but business surveys point to
stronger activity looking forward. In Canada, recent indicators suggest that
economic performance, while remaining strong in the first quarter, has
moderated somewhat from its torrid pace late last year.
Inflationary pressures remain virtually nonexistent, with consumer price
inflation remaining around one percent in the euro area and Canada. In Japan,
consumer prices have been declining. The stable outlook for prices factored into
decisions by several central banks to lower official interest rates. The Bank of
England and the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered rates by 25 basis points
and 50 basis points, respectively, on April 8, while the Bank of Canada lowered
its rate a cumulative 50 basis points in two separate actions on March 31 and
May 4.
In Japan, recent economic indicators provide little evidence of recovery, with
private consumption showing marked weakness. Retail sales during the first
quarter were down 4 percent (SAAR) from the fourth-quarter average. The
household expenditure series plunged during February and stayed weak during
March, after remaining roughly stable for most of the previous year. Labor
market conditions continued to be grim, with unemployment reaching a new all-
time high of 4.8 percent in March and the offers-to-applicants ratio remaining
near an all-time low. On the other hand, housing starts during the first quarter
increased smartly, as government incentives to stimulate home purchases
supported demand. New public works contracts also jumped during the first
quarter, suggesting that the November 1998 stimulus measures have already
come on line. Finally, industrial production during the first quarter edged up 0.4
percent (not annualized) from the fourth-quarter level but remained down 4.7
percent from a year earlier.

Deflationary pressures remain significant. The Tokyo CPI in April was down
0.2 percent from a year earlier. Given the estimated 3/4 to 1 percentage point
upward bias in inflation as measured by the Japanese CPI, consumer prices
(accurately measured) already are registering meaningful declines. In addition,
the wholesale price index in April declined 3.5 percent from a year earlier,
largely reflecting the yen's sharp appreciation during the second half of 1998.
Total employee earnings during the first quarter were down over 5 percent from
a year earlier, with bonus payments showing particular weakness.
In late March, fifteen major banks, with the conspicuous exception of Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, received injections of public funds totaling about ¥7.5
trillion, mostly in the form of convertible preferred shares. The banks have
pledged to cut employment and the number of branches, and implement other
restructuring measures.
In the euro zone, available indicators suggest that real GDP growth remained
weak in the first quarter. For the area as a whole, industrial production (s.a.) fell
in February. In Germany, industrial production moved down again in March.
The harmonized unemployment rate remained unchanged in February at 10.5
percent, somewhat below its December 1998 level of 10.7 percent. (In
constructing the harmonized unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes

IV-14
national statistics to International Labor Organization definitions.) The
unemployment rates (s.a.) in Germany and France remained steady in March at
10.5 percent and 11.5 percent respectively.
Upward price pressures continue to be nearly absent. Euro-area consumer prices
rose 1.0 percent over the year to March, according to the harmonized price
figures produced by Eurostat, up only slightly from the rate reported in
February.

Forward-looking indicators point to modest growth, at best, in economic activity
in the first-quarter: based on surveys of the eleven countries in the euro area
conducted by the European Commission, consumer confidence continued to
decline in April. Although business confidence in the construction sector has
improved somewhat this year, confidence in the manufacturing sector remained
very depressed in April. Both domestic and export orders have weakened
considerably in euro zone countries; this weakening is particularly striking for
Germany, France, and Italy. (The official orders data for Germany have been
sliding since the middle of 1998 and fell by an additional 0.8 percent in
February.) On April 26, the German government revised down its growth

IV-15
forecast for this year to about 1-1/2 percent from 2 percent, while predicting a
faster expansion of about 2-1/2 percent in 2000.

At its meeting on April 8, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank
(ECB) cut short-term interest rates for the euro zone. The rate on repurchase
operations was reduced 50 basis points to 2-1/2 percent. The marginal lending
rate and deposit rates (the upper and lower bands around the repo rate) were cut
as well, by 100 and 50 basis points, respectively, to 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent.
These actions marked the first change in the policy stance by the ECB, although
short-term interest rates had been reduced to 3 percent last December by the
central banks of prospective euro countries.
Both the German government and the ECB have revised down their projections
for German GDP growth in 1999. The potential impact of the Kosovo crisis on
the European economies remains unclear. However, both Italian and Greek
officials noted last week that the conflict could knock 1/4 to 1/2 percentage
point off economic growth in their respective countries this year, with the total
magnitude determined by how deep and protracted the crisis becomes.
Economic activity in the United Kingdom remained weak in the first quarter,
with the preliminary estimate showing real GDP growth of only 0.1 percent
(quarterly rate), unchanged from the previous quarter. Industrial output declined
over the quarter, primarily reflecting lower output of energy extraction and

IV-16
distribution industries during a warmer-than-normal winter. Growth in the
service sector slowed to 0.4 percent, as stronger output of consumer services was
offset by slower growth in business services. However, business surveys for
March and April indicate stronger activity looking forward, and business
confidence has improved markedly from the very low levels reached last fall.

Conditions in the labor market have been little changed in recent months, but
wage pressures may have stepped up a bit. The official unemployment rate was
unchanged at 4.6 percent in March, and the Labor Force Survey unemployment
rate was unchanged at 6.3 percent for the December-February period. However,
average earnings growth picked up slightly to 4.6 percent in February from an
upwardly-revised January rate of 4.5 percent.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation has remained close to the official
inflation target of 2.5 percent; the increase in inflation in March to 2.7 percent
primarily reflected tax changes affected by the timing of this year's and last
year's budgets. Producer input prices for materials and fuel recently have edged
up, primarily reflecting higher crude oil prices. On a twelve-month basis, input
prices were down 1.3 percent in April, compared with an average twelve-month
decline of about 9 percent last year.

IV-17
At its May meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England
voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 5-1/4 percent. In its May Inflation
Report, the MPC said that "the economy is now on course for growth with price
stability." Real GDP growth is expected to rise later this year to around trend by
the middle of next year. Compared with the projection in the February Report,
the pick-up occurs slightly sooner, with domestic demand growth stronger and
net trade weaker. Inflation is expected to average slightly below the inflation
target of 2.5 percent this year before rising slightly next year. The MPC stated
that the current exchange value of sterling was higher than assumed in the
February Report. The MPC's central projection includes a depreciation of the
currency, but the MPC noted that if sterling does not depreciate as expected,
"further easing of monetary policy might be needed to prevent undershooting of
the inflation target."
In Canada, recent indicators suggest that economic growth remained strong in
the first quarter but has moderated somewhat from the large upswing in activity
late last year. Real GDP at factor cost in January and February was up 0.7
percent on average from the fourth quarter. In comparison, real GDP at factor
cost rose 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Most of the slowdown in
real GDP reflects a return to more sustainable production levels after a large
increase in factory output related to the rebuilding of strike-depleted inventories.
Consumer spending appears to have rebounded, partly due to strong employment
gains late last year. In recent months, employment gains have moderated
considerably. In April, sluggish employment gains combined with a sharp jump
in the number of people looking for work resulted in a 0.5 percentage point
increase in the unemployment rate.
After dipping below the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent target range, twelve-
month CPI inflation moved unexpectedly higher in March and is now slightly
above one percent. Still, with inflation remaining near the lower end of the
target range, the Bank of Canada has lowered interest rates twice over the last
six weeks. The Bank of Canada reduced its key lending rate, the Bank Rate,
from 5-1/4 percent to 5 percent on March 31, and to 4-3/4 percent on May 4.
The Bank cited improvements in international financial markets as an additional
motivating factor behind the rate cuts. The potential disinflationary effects of
the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar probably also played a role in the
Bank of Canada's decision.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
While many emerging market economies remain in recession, there are
increasing indications that the international financial crisis may be abating. The
Brazilian economy's performance since the January devaluation of the real has
been much better than anticipated. Inflation has remained significantly lower
than expected, the real has appreciated substantially from its recent lows, output
has been less negatively affected than had been feared, and in late April, Brazil
successfully returned to the global bond market with a new issue. Other Latin
American economies have also exhibited better than expected performance. The
latest monthly statistics for Mexico suggest that output growth may have
resumed, while inflation and interest rates have fallen. Argentina is suffering a
contraction in output and exports, but has seen improvement in its financial
markets and continued low inflation. In Venezuela, however, output has
plunged in response to low oil export revenue, large government budget deficits
and political uncertainties.
In developing Asia, Korea appears to be recovering strongly from last year's
deep recession, with industrial output already above its pre-crisis level.
Economic activity in the ASEAN countries seems to have bottomed out, and
there are signs that a recovery has begun. Trade surpluses in Korea and the
ASEAN countries are falling as imports have begun to rebound. Inflation
throughout developing Asia has remained moderate or declined.
The economic situation in Russia remains grim, although a new agreement with
the IMF has been concluded, and the government has finally come to agreement
with external creditors over its defaulted ruble-denominated debt. Additionally,
industrial output has improved and inflation has begun to moderate.
Recent developments in Brazil have been far more favorable than feared in the
wake of the real's collapse last January. The real has strengthened, international
reserves (net of IMF and bilateral aid) have been stable, inflation has been
surprisingly subdued, and domestic pressures to reindex wage and other
contracts have died down. The national consumer price index rose only
3.7 percent in the first four months of 1999. Price indices in which traded goods
have a heavier weight rose by about eight percent over this period.
Lately, there have been some signs of economic recovery; the national industrial
production index rose 1.6 percent in March (SA, not at AR), after declines
earlier this year, but was 3.3 percent lower than in March 1998. However, the
unemployment rate in March reached 8.2 percent, high by historical standards.
A labor-funded institute's measure of unemployment (which counts as
unemployed itinerant, or underemployed workers) put the unemployment rate at
about 20 percent, its historical apex. As a result of weak domestic demand, the

IV-23
trade deficit for the first four months of 1999 was about one-half its level a year
ago, but did not narrow as much as had been hoped. While imports were down
by about 20 percent, exports also fell by about 15 percent; the fall in exports
reflected a drop in the prices of commodities and other exports and possibly
restricted access to export financing.

The lower-than-anticipated inflation rates and the recovery of the real prompted
the central bank to lower the overnight interest rate from 45 percent in early
March to 27 percent as of May 12. The central bank also announced that some
time in May it would implement an inflation targeting regime modeled after the
U.K. system.
Although Brazil is likely to pass the criterion for fiscal performance on the (non-
interest) primary surplus at its next IMF program review, which will take place
in mid-May at the earliest, the surplus in the first quarter was heavily boosted by
one-time revenues. Recent court decisions have also raised questions as to
whether the government will enact the financial transactions tax, which is a big
element of its fiscal adjustment program, on schedule in mid-1999.
In recent weeks, the Brazilian government and private sector borrowers have
returned to international bond markets, albeit at interest rates that, while down
from recent highs, were higher than those seen a year ago. In late April, the
Brazilian government launched a $3 billion 5-year global bond priced to yield
675 basis points above U.S. Treasuries, marking Brazil's first international bond

IV-24
issue since the collapse of the real. (The Brazilian government has indicated
that it would issue up to $2 billion in additional bonds over the next couple of
months.)
The Mexican economy has shown signs of renewed growth in recent months as
inflation and interest rates have fallen to 11-month lows. Following virtually no
growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter and seasonally adjusted month-to-
month declines in industrial production in January and February, industrial
production grew 1.2 percent in March. Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to
2.7 percent in March from 3.2 percent in February. The effects of recent oil
price increases, improvements in financial markets, and healthy U.S. growth are
likely to support further recovery in the near term.

The trade deficit was nearly unchanged in March as strong U.S. demand for
Mexican exports and higher oil prices helped to offset growing imports. In large
part reflecting the recent strength of the peso, inflation has moderated from
recent highs; prices rose only 0.9 percent in March, following increases of
2.5 and 1.3 percent in January and February, respectively.
On May 1, Mexico's Congress finally approved President Zedillo's nominations
to fill seats on the board of the new Bank Deposit Institute (IPAB) after rejecting
earlier nominees. Although negotiations must still take place to resolve who
will fill the two seats reserved for the heads of the Central Bank and the National

IV-25
Banking and Securities Commission, the process of selling-off and restructuring
the $65 billion in bad debt assumed from the banking sector can now begin.
In Argentina, despite a financial market recovery in recent months, there are
indications that consumer and business confidence is low and that the recession
is continuing. Real GDP declined by about 6 percent (SAAR) in the fourth
quarter, the second consecutive quarterly contraction. Seasonally adjusted
industrial production declined four percent in the first quarter of 1999 from
fourth quarter 1998. The sharp slowdown of economic activity has now begun
to narrow external imbalances; the trade deficit decreased to just over $3 billion
(AR) in the first quarter from roughly $4-1/2 billion (AR) in the previous
quarter.

Argentina's currency peg has kept inflation in check, with consumer prices
falling in April by less than 1 percent from the level a year ago. However, the
currency peg has led to a substantial real appreciation of the peso following the
Brazilian currency collapse, and has raised concerns about Argentina's
international competitiveness. With declining government revenues, the
recession has also raised concerns about the fiscal situation. In light of the
macroeconomic situation, the government of Argentina has successfully
renegotiated with the IMF its target for the 1999 central government balance to a
deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP from the 0.8 percent agreed upon earlier under the
terms of its $2.8 billion Extended Fund Facility.

IV-26
The Argentine government continues to show serious interest in the possibility
of a complete dollarization of its economy. However, government officials have
been sporadically issuing statements that the country plans to dollarize only if a
bilateral treaty of monetary association with the United States can be agreed
upon.
The Venezuelan economy continues to suffer from the effects of the past slump
in world oil prices, a ballooning government budget deficit, and uncertainties
associated with the domestic political situation. As a result of these factors, real
GDP declined sharply, by nearly 20 percent, in the fourth quarter of last year
(SAAR), putting year-over-year growth in 1998 into negative territory. Inflation
continues to be quite high with a 12-month rate of nearly 25 percent in April,
although the month-over-month increase of 1.1 percent in April is the lowest
monthly rate of inflation in 10 years. With the recent increase in oil prices,
Venezuelan exports and government revenues will rise, improving external
balances and easing the fiscal problems the economy is now facing.

In Korea, recent data have provided further evidence that a strong recovery is
underway. Industrial production registered a seasonally adjusted increase of
4.2 percent in March following a 2.7 percent rise in February, moving it well
above its level before the onset of the financial crisis in late 1997. Production of
semiconductors and motor vehicles in March were especially strong, showing
increases of over 40 percent from their year-earlier levels. The factory operation
rate rose to nearly 75 percent (NSA) in March, up from just under 70 percent in
February, but still below the rate of around 80 percent prevailing before the 1997

IV-27
financial crisis. The seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate declined to
8.1 percent in March from the record high 8.7 percent of the previous month. In
April, militant unions attempted to launch a "spring offensive" of strikes to
protest layoffs associated with corporate restructuring. However, the response
by targeted workers was generally tepid, and the strikes were called off.
With activity rising, the trade surplus appears to be declining. The trade surplus
in the first quarter was about 25 percent below that in the first quarter of last
year. Exports in the first quarter were 3 percent below their year-earlier level
while imports increased by 6 percent over this period.
The deal for U.S.-based Newbridge Capital to acquire a controlling interest in
government-owned Korea First Bank has collapsed. The tentative agreement
that Newbridge and the government reached in December broke down over
valuation of Korea First's debts, which the government had agreed to cover.
This would have been the first sale of a Korea bank to foreign interests, and a
successful completion of the deal has been viewed as an important barometer of
the government's commitment to financial reform. Korean officials indicated
that they were open to other takeover bids, and still intended to sell the bank to
foreign investors.

Recent indicators for the ASEAN countries suggest that economic activity in the
region has bottomed out and an anemic recovery has begun. Preliminary first
quarter GDP growth was stronger than expected in Indonesia, although
consumer and business confidence remains fragile in the run-up to parliamentary
elections scheduled for June. Industrial production has resumed growing in

IV-28
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, and the contraction has slowed substantially
in the Philippines.
All the ASEAN countries are running trade surpluses, with balances up sharply
across the region relative to last year, primarily due to a large contraction in
imports. However, a positive development in recent months has been the
stabilization of imports across the region and even increases in some countries.
ASEAN financial markets have surged recently as signals of an economic
recovery have begun to emerge, and the region's currencies have begun to
strengthen. Inflation has been declining across the region, mainly reflecting
weak domestic demand.

Several Thai banks met with unexpected success in raising private capital in the
first quarter. This success prompted Moody's rating service to upgrade its
ratings outlook for Thai banks to stable from negative and the Thai foreign
currency ceiling outlook to positive from stable. Moody's also upgraded the
foreign currency outlook for Malaysia to stable from negative. Meanwhile,
Indonesia and the foreign bank creditors steering committee reached agreement
on an exchange offer for interbank debt due by year-end 2001. However, less
progress has been made in corporate restructuring throughout the region.

Hong Kong's unemployment rate was 6.2 percent during the first quarter, up
from 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. Consumer prices continue to fall.
The merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in March reflecting seasonal
factors. Foreign exchange reserves have risen by about $2 billion from their
September low to $90 billion. Spreads between one-year Hong Kong
government debt and U.S. Treasuries fell to around 80 basis points in early May,
their lowest level since August 1997.

In China, GDP rose 8.3 percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period,
reflecting high public investment in the second half of 1998 and early 1999, but
we estimate that seasonally adjusted GDP growth slowed sharply in the first
quarter. This slowdown almost surely reflects temporary factors that artificially
boosted the level of measured output in the fourth quarter, and thus probably
overstates the weakening of the economy. Moderate deflation continues,
reflecting weak private demand as well as falling import prices. Foreign direct
investment fell 14 percent from its year-earlier level. The trade surplus
continued to narrow in the first four months of the year, reflecting weakening
exports and a surge in imports. The dollar value of exports fell 8 percent from
its year-earlier level, while the value of imports rose 14 percent. The strength in
imports appears to reflect an anti-smuggling campaign begun in the second half
of last year. As a result of this campaign, some smuggled imports that were
previously unrecorded in the customs statistics (and thus increased China's
sizeable errors and omissions in the balance of payments) are now passing
through official import channels.

In Taiwan, unemployment was 2.8 percent in March, roughly unchanged from
the beginning of the year. Prices in March were slightly lower than their year-
earlier level. This deflation appears to reflect falling import prices as well as
slowing demand growth. Taiwan's trade surplus rose in the first four months of
1999, with the value of exports rising 4 percent from a year-earlier and the value
of imports falling 7 percent. Foreign exchange reserves rose to $95 billion in
April, up about $4 billion from December and the highest level since July 1997.
Taiwan's stock market has risen about 30 percent since its recent low in
February. Earlier in the year, the government's stock stabilization fund
intervened heavily, but recent stock market increases do not appear to reflect
intervention.

The Russian economy continues to deteriorate, but the news is not uniformly
bad. The cheaper ruble (down about 75 percent in nominal terms since the crisis
struck last August and down 15 percent so far this year) and strong import
substitution have cushioned the impact of the crisis on producers, allowing
industrial output to post positive twelve-month growth of 1.4 percent in March.
Inflation soared to over 113 percent in April (twelve-month basis), but monthly
inflation has declined from a recent high of 11.6 percent in December to
3 percent in April.
On April 28, an agreement was reached on a new IMF program that offers
$4.5 billion over 18 months, with $3 billion available in the first twelve months.
Russia is required to repay to the IMF in 1999 more than four billion dollars
owed from previous programs. Compliance with the agreement, which specifies
a primary budget surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 1999, hinges on the ability of
the government to pass key legislation on tax reform and bank restructuring
through the communist-dominated lower house of parliament. The agreement
also opens the door to a further $2 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion
from Japan, and gives the green light to talks with London and Paris Club
creditors on restructuring Russia's large Soviet-era debts.
The agreement with the IMF is threatened, however, by President Yeltsin's
May 12 decision to dismiss Yevgeny Primakov from the post of Prime Minister.
Likely Duma hostility towards a new Prime Minister could undermine the new
government's ability to deliver on key reforms needed to secure multilateral
funding to service external debts. Both the IMF and the World Bank have said
that their agreements were with the old Primakov government and that they will
wait to see how the new government shapes up before pronouncing on the fate
of their recently agreed programs.
The eight-month standoff between the government and foreign investors over
restructuring short-term domestic ruble debt (GKO/OFZ debt) ended in April
with 88.5 percent of foreigners conceding to accept the "confiscatory" terms
offered by the government. About half of the foreigners held out until the last
moment before relenting in the face of still harsher terms to be imposed on
unyielding investors.
