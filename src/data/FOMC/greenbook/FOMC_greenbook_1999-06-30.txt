Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity has continued to expand in the current quarter, though
apparently more moderately than earlier in the year. Consumer spending and
construction outlays have decelerated from their blistering gains in the first
quarter, and this has evidently been only partially offset by faster growth of
business purchases of equipment and a lesser decline in real net exports. The
labor market has remained tight, with job gains sufficient on average to push the
unemployment rate back down to 4.2 percent in May. Wage and price increases
have been a bit larger on net in the past few months, but longer-term inflation
trends have remained favorable to this point.
Labor Market Developments
Employment growth has been choppy this year. Smoothing through the
fluctuations, private nonfarm payrolls rose an average of 175,000 a month in
April and May, essentially unchanged from the pace over the first quarter.' The
aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers rose rather
modestly in the past two months, however, as the implicit average workweek
edged down somewhat. This is a curious development in such a tight labor
market, but it may reflect in small part recent job losses in manufacturing, where
workweeks tend to be relatively long. Taking the first five months of the year
together, growth in overall payrolls and production worker hours has slipped a
bit from the trends in 1998.
Factory payrolls contracted in April and May at about the same rate as in the
first quarter. Mining also continued to shed workers, reflecting in part the
cautious response of domestic drilling companies to the resurgence of oil prices.
Over the past several months, growth in construction employment has fluctuated
widely. After a sizable increase in the first quarter, construction jobs were little
changed, on net, in April and May. Some of the slowing this quarter merely
reflects the fact that building activity fell less than the seasonal norm through the
winter months; and with workers reportedly in short supply, employers
apparently also are straining to meet the usual spring seasonal pickup in hiring.
1. The May establishment report contained the annual benchmark revisions, which include
the most recent comprehensive count of payroll jobs; the revisions affect data since April 1997.
The revision to the level of payroll employment was small--the not seasonally adjusted March
level was raised by 44,000, or less than 0.1 percent. As usual, new seasonal factors were
estimated and applied to data back to January 1994. Also, the bias-adjustment factors were
revised up an average of 13,000 per month to a monthly average of 150,000, which led to
small upward revisions to job growth from April 1998 forward. The BLS uses its bias-
adjustment factors mainly to capture employment gains due to new establishments that are
missed in its regular monthly survey

In contrast, employment growth has remained robust in the service-producing
sector. Finance, insurance, and real estate, wholesale and retail trade, services,
and transportation and public utilities continued to add jobs in April and May at
a rate that, in most cases, matched or exceeded the first-quarter pace.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked back down to 4.2 percent
in May; before hitting this level in March, the unemployment rate had not been
so low since 1970. The labor force participation rate edged down to
67.0 percent in May, toward the lower end of the range it has traced out over the
past year. The share of the population out of the labor force but wanting ajob
dropped back in May following an uptick in April; overall, this share has not
moved much from the very low level reached at the end of 1998. In addition,
the number of job leavers who have been unemployed for less than five weeks as
a percentage of household employment has risen sharply recently. This is
consistent with a tight labor market in which individuals feel more confident
about leaving their current employers to look for opportunities elsewhere.
Other indicators also suggest, as yet, no appreciable slackening in labor demand.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low since the
reference week for the May employment report. Surveys of business hiring
plans and help-wanted advertising are off their recent peaks but remain at
relatively favorable levels, and firms still report that some types of jobs are very
hard to fill.2 Individuals' perceptions of current labor market conditions are
quite positive: The proportion of households that reported that jobs are plentiful
remained high in the Conference Board survey in May, and in June the Michigan
index of expected employment conditions rose sharply.
According to the BLS's most recent estimate, productivity in the nonfarm
business sector rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 1999. This
is a downward revision of 1/2 percentage point from the earlier estimate and
reflects a reduced estimate of the growth in output. Over the past four quarters,
labor productivity rose 2.6 percent.3 In the nonfinancial corporate sector,
2. The National Federation of Independent Business's diffusion index on net hiring strength
and its series on the share of firms reporting that jobs are difficult to fill both dropped sharply in
May. These series, however, are volatile, which may partly reflect the variation in sample size
from one month to the next: The sample for the NFIB survey in the first month of each quarter
is about twice the size as in the second and third months.
3. Updated figures for first-quarter productivity will be published in August. Although
nonfarm business sector output is currently reported to have increased at an annual rate of 4.4
percent in the first quarter, we estimate that growth in output will likely be revised back up to
around 5 percent at an annual rate. Also, the first-quarter estimate of growth in nonfarm hours,
0.9 percent at an annual rate, does not incorporate the revisions to employment and hours
published in the May Employment Situation. However, given these data, we expect only a small
revision to the first-quarter increase in hours.

productivity surged 4.2 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter and is up
3.7 percent over the past four quarters.4
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.2 percent last month, despite a sharp weather-related
drop in the output of utilities. Manufacturing production rose 0.4 percent in
May following gains of similar magnitudes in the preceding three months. The
increases in production have lifted the factory operating rate 0.2 percentage
point over the past three months to 79.7 percent in May, but this still is nearly
2 percentage points below the long-term average.
The output of motor vehicles and parts was up 2.2 percent in May, as the
industry attempted to keep up with the blockbuster pace of sales. Production
schedules for the third quarter indicate that assemblies are likely to remain high:
They call for output to run at an annual rate of 13.1 million units, about the same
as in the second quarter. High production rates could well be maintained even if

sales were to unexpectedly fall below the industry's forecast, as firms might see
an advantage in building inventories prior to the upcoming labor negotiations.5
Elsewhere in manufacturing, advances were again fairly widespread in May. In
particular, the high-tech sectors continue to be strong. Production has
accelerated sharply for communications equipment in the past two months,
while computers and semiconductors have continued to post solid gains in
output. In addition, the output of iron and steel rose further in May after having
plummeted in 1998. In contrast, production of aircraft and parts fell for the third
consecutive month in May, reflecting Boeing's continued downshift in
assemblies. The output of nondurable goods, which has been rising slowly since
last fall, posted another small increase in May. The gains last month were
relatively broadly based, with the main exceptions being apparel and textiles.
Recent readings on orders for manufactured goods suggest that factory output
should continue to rise at a substantial clip in the near term. The new orders
index from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM)
bounced up to its highest level in nineteen months in May, partly reflecting the
improvement in export orders this year. The staffs series on real adjusted
durable goods orders rose 1.2 percent in April following a sizable increase in the
first quarter. The latest Beige Book reported improvement in manufacturing
activity in most Districts. Respondents noted continued fierce competition from
low-priced imports but also suggested that, on balance, foreign demand for
manufactured goods has stabilized or improved slightly.
The May IP release contained new estimates of manufacturing capacity growth
for 1999, which were last updated in December. Manufacturing capacity is now
expected to grow 3.8 percent in 1999, versus the earlier estimate of 3.6 percent.
The revised estimates reflect in part the May NAPM Semiannual Economic
Forecast for Manufacturing, which showed a slight elevation of capital
expenditure plans for 1999.6 Some of the larger upward revisions to capacity
growth occurred in high-tech industries such as semiconductors and in industries
5. The current United Auto Workers Union (UAW) and Canadian Auto Workers Union
(CAW) contracts expire on September 14 and September 21 respectively. Representatives from
the automakers and unions began preliminary negotiations this month. However, in a twist from
the usual pattern, the UAW will continue to negotiate simultaneously with General Motors,
Ford, and DaimlerChrysler until an agreement is reached with one company. This contract will
then set the pattern for the industry. The CAW will follow the more typical pattern of selecting
a single company with which to negotiate a new contract.
6. The revision to capacity growth also reflects the incorporation of data on contracts for
industrial building. These have been very weak in recent months and held down the revision to
capacity growth.

that produce construction supplies--most notably, lumber and related products
and stone, glass, and clay products.
Motor Vehicles
Adjusted for shifts in manufacturers' reporting periods, light vehicle sales rose
nearly 1 million units in May to an extraordinary 17 million units at an annual
rate. So far this year, adjusted light vehicle sales have averaged a robust
16.3 million unit pace. Recent indicators point to continued strength in vehicle
demand in the near term, and industry analysts' expectations for third-quarter
sales currently lie in the range of 16.4 million to 16.7 million units (annual rate).
The surge in sales in May reflected higher retail purchases--that is, sales and
leases to consumers.7 So far this year, retail purchases have averaged 83 percent
of total industry light vehicle sales--up noticeably from the fourth quarter of last
year. Consumers' willingness and ability to maintain vehicle purchases at
elevated levels have no doubt been aided by favorable trends in personal income
and wealth as well as generous marketing incentives.8 These incentives have
helped to hold down prices: According to the CPI, over the past year prices for
autos have fallen 3/4 percent while--despite very strong demand--prices for light
trucks are up just 3/4 percent. In the Michigan survey, the index of car-buying
conditions remains at a very positive level, although it has moved a bit lower on
net since January.
On the business front, fleet sales of light vehicles have remained strong so far
this year, with purchases running just above their 1998 level. Demand for
medium and heavy trucks also has been quite robust. Sales of these vehicles in
May were 642,000 units at an annual rate, up by about 17,000 units from the
level in April. In addition, new orders for heavy trucks rose sharply in May and,
for the first time in seven months, backlogs increased.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, growth in consumer spending
appears to have moderated from the first quarter's spectacular pace, but it has
remained quite brisk. Real PCE in April and May still appears to be up at an
annual rate of more than 4 percent from the first-quarter average. The
fundamental determinants of consumption growth remain positive: Income and
wealth have continued to trend up, and consumer confidence consequently is
extraordinarily high.

8. Incentives include cut-rate financing on loans offered by auto companies through their
financing subsidiaries.

According to the advance report for May, nominal spending at stores in the retail
control category, which excludes automotive dealers and building material and
supply stores, rose 0.5 percent. In addition, nominal growth in the retail control
was revised up from 0.4 percent to 0.7 percent in April. Gains last month were
spread widely across major types of retail outlets, with particularly large
increases reported by stores selling furniture and appliances, "other durable
goods," food, and general merchandise. BEA uses nominal sales in the retail
control to construct its estimates of real PCE for goods other than motor
vehicles; given the relatively small changes, overall, in the CPI for these items,
the retail sales data should translate into a sizable increase in real expenditures
last month.
The most recent information on outlays for services is for April, when real
service outlays are estimated by the BEA to have risen 0.5 percent for the second
consecutive month. Particularly large gains were recorded for recreational
services and brokerage fees. Real expenditures for electricity and natural gas
edged lower, but weather data suggest that, for the second quarter as a whole,
real spending for energy services will likely be little changed from the first-
quarter level.
The increases in hours worked and average hourly earnings in the May
employment report suggest a solid increase in nominal wages and salaries last
month, which, with prices up only modestly, should yield a sizable boost to real
income. On average, the year-on-year growth in real disposable income in April
and May appears to be running close to the trends seen in late 1998 and early
1999. In April, outlays grew at about the same rate as disposable income, and
the personal saving rate held steady at -0.7 percent.
According to its preliminary report for June, the Michigan Survey Research
Center's index of consumer sentiment climbed to the second-highest reading
ever. Respondents' views about expected business conditions during the next
five years nearly reached the historical peak, and appraisals of current buying
conditions for automobiles and major household durables remained in very
favorable ranges.
Housing Markets
Housing demand has been robust this spring, and builders have been hard
pressed to keep up with it. Starts of single-family houses zig-zigged in the past
couple of months but averaged 1.33 million units (annual rate)--somewhat below
the pace in the fourth and first quarters. Multifamily starts also fell off in April
and May. As we have noted previously, aided by mild weather, builders did not
pare construction as much as they usually do in the late fall and winter. This

spring, with limited availability of labor and some materials, builders evidently
have been unable to boost starts by the usual seasonal increment.
Data on home sales, which are available only through April, remained strong.
Indeed, sales of new homes rose to an annual rate of 980,000 units in that month,
the second highest level on record and well above the first-quarter pace.
Existing home sales were at a 5.24 million unit pace in April, a bit above the
average earlier this year. (New homes sales are the more current indicator, for
they generally are reported at the contract phase rather than at closing, as is more
common for the existing home series.)
Last week, the contract rate for thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages stood at
7.65 percent, more than 80 basis points above its average late last year and early
this year.9 Despite the recent rise in mortgage rates, indicators of housing
demand have remained strong. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes
have picked back up recently. In addition, builders' ratings of new home sales
soared in June to the highest level on record. However, recent data from the
Michigan survey showed that the back-up in mortgage rates has contributed to
some retreat in consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions.
Reflecting the pressures of demand, some acceleration may be occurring in the
prices of homes, but the statistics at this point are mixed. The volatile series on
average prices for new homes jumped in April relative to a year ago. In
addition, the constant-quality price index for new homes--which holds constant a
number of attributes and is thus a better measure of house price inflation--has
accelerated in recent quarters. However, in the market for existing homes, the
data that we normally look at show no pickup in price gains--despite reports of
fast sales and bids above asking prices. In fact, over the twelve months ended in
April, the average price of existing homes increased 5.3 percent, down about
1 percentage point from the same period a year ago. In the first quarter, the
repeat sales index, which tracks sales of the same units over time, was up
4.9 percent from a year earlier. Although this is a relatively high rate of
increase, it is, nonetheless, about 1 percentage point less than the recent peak in
the year-over-year price gains registered in the second quarter of last year.
Cost pressures appear to be mounting in this sector. The average hourly
earnings of construction workers, which decelerated last year, have picked up in
recent months and in May had risen 3.6 percent from a year earlier. The
9. Over the same period, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates have risen more than 35
basis points. The share of ARM mortgage originations has risen from a recent low of 8 percent
in October to 14 percent in April (latest available data).

employment cost index for the construction industry, which includes both wages
and benefits but holds constant the mix of jobs and overtime, also has
accelerated noticeably during the past few quarters. With regard to construction
materials, the prices of gypsum, lumber, plywood, and insulation materials have
soared recently.10 However, the producer price index for components and
materials for construction--which measures the cost of inputs for all types of
construction (not just residential)--has risen only 1 percent over the twelve
months ended in May. The increase in this aggregate index has been held back
by lower prices for asphalt roofing materials and a variety of metals.11
Business Fixed Investment
Producers' durable equipment. Real outlays on producers' durable equipment
appear to have accelerated in the current quarter, with spending on computing
equipment leading the way. Nominal shipments of office and computing
equipment surged 6-1/2 percent in April, one of the largest monthly increases in
the current expansion. Combined with significant declines in the PPI for
computing equipment, this pace of nominal spending has given real outlays a
leg-up on another outsized gain this quarter.
The underlying trend in business demand for computing equipment is difficult
to read, however, because it is impossible to identify the extent of business
efforts to address the Y2K problem. The replacement of old hardware that was
not Y2K-compliant has certainly added to spending over the past year.
However, corporate reports seem to suggest that, on balance, this boost is now
waning. Still, the ongoing patterns of technological advance, steep price
declines, and the shift towards electronic commerce seem likely to continue to
increase firms' desired stock of computing equipment. Furthermore, given the
expansion in the stock of computers that has already occurred and their very fast
depreciation rate, the level of gross investment needed merely to replace
obsolete equipment is rising rapidly.
Outlays for transportation equipment also appear set for a hefty gain in the
current quarter. Business demand for motor vehicles, particularly for medium
and heavy trucks, is remarkably strong, and the backlog of unfilled orders for
10. Shortages of drywall may be creating bottlenecks and delaying the completion of
projects. However, the cost pressures on the price of single-family houses owing to the recent
run up in drywall prices are limited: The typical house requires about 7,000 square feet of
drywall, which even at today's inflated prices costs only about $1000.
11. Any acceleration in construction costs has not yet been evident in the Census estimate of
average cost per start of single-family houses, which decelerated in 1998 and has picked up only
modestly, on net, during the past few months. The data on average cost per start do not hold
constant either the regional composition or the attributes of the units under construction.

these vehicles remains very large. Shipments of aircraft to domestic carriers
appear likely to post a strong rebound in the current quarter. These shipments
have been bouncing around very high levels since early last year, reflecting a
surge in demand in response to strong growth in air traffic and soaring airline
profits. However, with order backlogs down, the level of aircraft investment
appears poised to fall.
Spending on equipment outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors has
remained sluggish. In April, shipments of this equipment declined nearly
2 percent, and imports of capital goods were weak. However, forward-looking
indicators are more positive. Excluding gas turbines (for which orders have
surged but lead times are long), orders for these items have been strong of late,
and the backlog of unfilled orders has stabilized after having fallen considerably
in 1998.
Nonresidential structures. After remaining flat in 1998, we estimate that
real nonresidential construction rose at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent in the
first quarter, reflecting, in part, sharp increases in the construction of office
buildings, other commercial structures, and lodging facilities.12 In April,
though, construction put in place declined in all of the major building
categories. Moreover, since around the turn of the year, contracts for future
construction generally have either been flat or have trended lower.13
According to the National Real Estate Index, prices for office buildings rose
13 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier--similar to the average pace
during the previous year or so. Vacancy rates ticked up in the first quarter
but remained very low relative to the rates in the early 1990s. Together, these
data indicate that the gains in office construction during the past few years
have not led to supply imbalances to date, and given the decline in contracts
for office buildings, it seems unlikely that projects in the pipeline will lead to
excess capacity. Elsewhere, the prices for retail stores have decelerated
sharply since the beginning of last year. Retail outlets are the largest
component of the "other commercial" category in the construction put in place
data; building in this sector has been moving sideways over the past couple of
12. We anticipate an upward revision to first-quarter growth in nonresidential construction
from 3 percent at an annual rate to 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate.
13. With the release of the May data, contracts were revised back to early 1998. The level
of nonresidential contracts in the first quarter of 1999 was revised up 7 percent. Although the
trend through the first quarter is still flat to down, it is not as weak as it appeared before the
revision. However, contracts are now reported to have declined more steeply in April--leaving
the level only one percent above the previous estimate. These data are still subject to further
revision.

years, and the contracts data do not suggest any major change in this trend in
the coming months.
Business Inventories
At a $10 billion annual rate in book value terms, the April pace of stockbuilding
in manufacturing and trade excluding motor vehicles was little changed from the
first-quarter pace. Given these subdued rates of inventory investment and the
strong gains in business sales, stocks, in the aggregate, remain relatively lean,
and only isolated imbalances are evident in the sectoral detail.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories fell in April at an annual rate of
about $7 billion, following a decline of the same size in March. Indeed, stocks
have fallen in each of the past six months at an average annual rate of
$16 billion. This drop largely has been due to shrinking stocks at aircraft firms,
a development that seems to be related to the falloff in production at Boeing and
is reflected in a large decline in work-in-process inventories in the transportation
sector. Excluding aircraft, inventories, on balance, have declined slightly this
year, and inventory-shipments ratios have eased. Most notably, inventory-
shipments ratios have been pared significantly in sectors such as metals and
chemicals, where stocks ran up substantially last year as a result of weak
demand.
Wholesale inventories (excluding motor vehicles) accumulated at an annual rate
of roughly $6 billion in April. A $10 billion increase in inventories at drug
wholesalers more than accounted for this rise. Sales at both wholesale
distributors and retail outlets have been very strong this year, and before April's
stockbuilding, the wholesale inventory-sales ratio for drugs had slipped to a very
low level. For the nonauto wholesale sector as a whole, the inventory-sales ratio
ticked up in April, but it was still well below the high levels recorded over the
second half of last year. On balance, wholesale stocks seem to be at fairly
comfortable levels. Inventory-sales ratios for metals and minerals and
miscellaneous durables (a category that includes wholesalers of steel scrap) have
backed off substantially since last autumn, and the ratio for professional and
commercial equipment (a category that includes computers) has dropped sharply
in recent months. However, inventory-sales ratios remain stubbornly high at
wholesalers of machinery and chemicals.
Retail stocks remained very lean in April. Non-auto retail inventories rose
moderately, and the inventory-sales ratio remained at 1.36 months for the third
month in a row. This is the lowest inventory-sales ratio recorded since 1980.
Most notably, inventories of apparel outlets increased only marginally in April,
and the inventory-sales ratio for these stores, which had run up last year,
declined to 2.31 months, down from 2.54 months in September of last year.

Federal Government
The federal budget surplus over the twelve months ended in May was
$94 billion, a $34 billion decline versus the corresponding year-earlier period.
Adjusting outlays for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance,
major asset sales, and spectrum auction proceeds, the year's improvement was
about $55 billion.
Over April and May alone, the adjusted surplus was about $10 billion higher
than in the same period last year. Total adjusted outlays are about the same as
during the year-earlier period as declines in spending on net interest, income
security, Medicare, and defense offset moderate increases elsewhere.
This spring's tax season did not provide as great a revenue surprise as
experienced in 1997 and 1998. Underlying personal tax liabilities continue to
grow at a steady pace. During April and May, nonwithheld income and self-
employed taxes (which include both final payments on 1998 liabilities and
estimated taxes for the first quarter of 1999) were about 11 percent higher than
last year. Individual income tax refunds also rose sharply, largely reflecting the
child tax credit that became effective in 1998. Corporate tax receipts were down
16 percent, likely reflecting, in part, weak profits in 1998.
On May 21, the President signed the 1999 Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act into law. It provides $15 billion in emergency
appropriations for fiscal years 1999 through 2005 and is estimated to increase
outlays by $3.7 billion in fiscal year 1999 and $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2000.
About 80 percent of the spending in these two years is allocated to defense. The
remainder is allocated to disaster aid and farm relief. Because these outlays
were deemed "emergency" spending, they are not counted against the
discretionary spending caps.
State and Local Governments
Real spending by state and local governments appears to be holding roughly
steady in the second quarter after having risen about 8 percent at an annual rate
in the first quarter. The surge in spending last quarter was driven mainly by
construction outlays as unusually favorable weather allowed highway work to
proceed without the typical seasonal slowdown. Construction fell sharply in
April, though it remained well above the pace of late 1998. Employment growth
also moderated in the spring after exceptionally large gains in the first quarter.
So far this year, job growth has averaged 30,000 per month, slightly above the
average for 1998 as a whole.
On balance, finances in most states appear to be finishing their fiscal years in
good shape. Survey data published by the Center for the Study of the States

indicate relatively strong revenue gains through the third quarter of fiscal 1999
(in almost all cases the first quarter of calendar 1999). In addition, almost all of
the states are expected to have their fiscal year 2000 budgets in place on time
this year.
Prices and Wages
Prices. Since the previous Greenbook, we have received CPI data for both
April and May. The CPI rose a hefty 0.7 percent in April but was unchanged
in May. The large April increase owed, in part, to a 6 percent rise in energy
prices. But the CPI excluding food and energy also played a role, posting a
0.4 percent monthly increase. In May, the core CPI excluding food and
energy edged up just 0.1 percent while energy prices fell. Balancing the two
reports, the underlying trend in core inflation appears little changed, with only
a hint of incipient acceleration in prices.
The large increase in energy prices in April was the result of both the run-up
in crude oil prices and some refinery fires in California, which pushed up
gasoline prices there. The May decline in energy prices was, in large part, a
result of a partial easing of the gasoline supply problems in California;
nationally, gasoline prices fell 2.6 percent last month, and survey evidence
suggests that the decline continued in June. By contrast, heating fuel prices,
which were not affected by the California refinery problems, moved up further
in May, reflecting continued pass-through of the increase in crude oil prices
earlier this year.
Consumer food prices rose 0.1 percent in April and 0.4 percent in May. Fruit
and vegetable prices, which typically account for much of the short-run
volatility in food prices, posted large increases in both months. Excluding
fruits and vegetables, food prices changed little over the past two months.
Over the past twelve months, the CPI for food has increased 2.1 percent.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy rose 0.6 percent in April
but edged down 0.1 percent in May. These swings in the core CPI for
commodities mainly reflected price movements in the volatile tobacco and
apparel categories. Since their peak in January, tobacco prices have come
down about 3 percent (not at an annual rate). But they were still up
28 percent over the past twelve months, contributing roughly 1/4 percentage
point to core inflation over that period. So far this year, apparel prices have
fallen 3/4 percent at an annual rate, in line with their pace of decline last year.
Among other consumer goods, prices of new motor vehicles were about flat in
April and May, with new truck prices rising a bit and new car prices falling
on net. Prices of used cars and trucks posted hefty increases in April and May
after having decreased in each of the preceding four months.

The CPI for services other than energy rose 0.4 percent in April and
0.2 percent in May. The April rise was boosted by large increases in airfares
and hotel room rates; prices in both of these areas fell in May. For the period
ahead, press reports on airfares have sent conflicting signals in recent weeks:
At the start of June, major airlines reportedly implemented an across-the-
board 4 percent increase in "leisure" airfares, but the following week reports
indicated that several airlines had offered temporary steep discounts on
selected flights with excess capacity.
The BLS recently published their new "current-methods" CPI, which attempts
to approximate how the CPI would have behaved if current methods for
constructing the index had been used over history. This new series is more
useful than the published CPI for making comparisons over time because it is
less affected by technical changes. Over the twelve months ended in May 1999,
the current-methods CPI excluding food and energy increased 1.9 percent,
compared with an increase of 2.1 percent over the preceding twelve-month
period.14 This index does not take into account the effects of the change in base-
year weights introduced in January 1998, which also affects comparability of
inflation rates. If the index also is adjusted for the new weights, its increase
over the twelve months ended in May 1998 would be 2.0 percent.
The PPI for capital goods increased 0.2 percent in May, the first increase in
six months. Producer prices of motor vehicles rose in May, in part because
manufacturers had added incentives earlier in the year than usual. Elsewhere
among capital goods, computer prices fell 2.2 percent in May and are down
24 percent over the past twelve months.
Prices of non-energy materials at earlier stages of processing appear to have
stopped falling this year, and some measures have edged up slightly: The PPI
for intermediate materials has risen in each of the past three months after
fifteen months with no increases in this series. In part, the pickup in core
intermediate materials prices likely reflects the indirect effects of higher
energy prices. However, as mentioned earlier, prices of a variety of materials
used in home construction, notably plywood, softwood lumber, and gypsum
products, also have risen sharply in recent months as strong demand appears
to be leading to shortages. The picture for the PPI for crude materials other
than food and energy is more mixed, with an increase in May but declines in
March and April. On balance, the PPI for core crude materials has moved up
14. The published CPI excluding food and energy was up 2 percent over the twelve months
ended in May 1999 and 2.2 percent over the preceding twelve-month period.

about 1-1/2 percent so for this year after having fallen 16 percent over the
twelve months of 1998.
Since PPI prices were collected in mid-May, commodity price movements
have been mixed. Steel scrap prices have risen sharply and aluminum prices
have moved higher, but prices for copper dropped sharply. Prices of lumber
and plywood have continued to skyrocket.
For the second quarter, median household inflation expectations for the year
ahead averaged 2.7 percent according to the Michigan survey, about the same
as in the first quarter but up from the 2.4 percent average of the second half of
1998. Longer-term median inflation expectations from the Michigan survey
(for five to ten years ahead) remained at 2.8 percent in the second quarter, the
same as in the preceding four quarters.
Wages. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in May after an increase
of 0.2 percent in April. Revised data pushed up the twelve-month change as of
April by 0.3 percentage point, to 3.5 percent.15 Over the twelve months ending
in May, average hourly earnings have increased 3.6 percent, compared with
4.3 percent over the preceding twelve-month period. Low price inflation in
1998 and early 1999 probably helped hold down the latest wage change figures.
In addition, the May 1998 twelve-month change included a minimum wage
hike, which may have boosted growth in hourly earnings by as much as
1/4 percentage point over that period.
15. In addition to the usual update of seasonal factors in the BLS's annual revision to the
payroll data, the new average hourly earnings figures also reflect the correction of mistakes in
the previously published March and April data for wholesale and retail trade.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Market reaction to the announcement that the FOMC had adopted a tightening
bias at its May meeting was muted, but subsequent evidence of continued
economic strength and official comments heightened concerns that a sequence of
hikes in the federal funds rate might be close at hand. By mid-June, just before
the release of the consumer price index for May, the thirty-year Treasury coupon
yield was 6.11 percent, up 20 basis points from the May FOMC meeting, and
coupon yields at shorter maturities had risen more than 30 basis points. Market
participants found comfort in the subdued price report and in Chairman
Greenspan's congressional testimony the next day, and Treasury yields fell back
considerably. However, the rally fizzled after a couple of days, and long rates
have returned to their recent highs. Futures rates indicate that markets have
priced in a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate at the June meeting and are
putting some weight on another 25 basis point boost by late summer.
Measures of market liquidity have deteriorated a touch over the intermeeting
period. On-the-run/off-the-run spreads on Treasury securities have edged up, as
have bid-ask spreads for off-the-run securities with less than five years to
maturity. However, credit risk spreads have registered small mixed changes:
Spreads of investment-grade corporate bond rates over Treasuries have risen a
little, while spreads on junk bonds are down slightly.
Equity prices of many firms have swung widely over the intermeeting period,
partly in response to the movements in bond yields. But, overall, stocks seem to
have fared better than bonds, apparently reflecting generally favorable earnings
expectations. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq price indexes are little changed, on net,
from the May FOMC meeting, while the DJIA is down about 1 percent.
Business and household borrowing appears to have slowed somewhat in the
second quarter from the very brisk first-quarter pace. Gross corporate bond
issuance was heavy in April and May, but dropped off when interest rates moved
up in late May. When interest rates dipped in mid-June, issuers returned to the
market. Bank lending to businesses has been weak since the start of the year,
but there are signs of a stirring in June. In the household sector, the growth of
consumer credit slowed to a 3-1/2 percent annual pace in April, and the growth
of home mortgage debt for the second quarter as a whole seems likely to edge
off its double-digit pace of the preceding two quarters. Meanwhile, municipal
bond issuance has continued to be moderate, and the Treasury has paid down a
sizable amount of debt this quarter.
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates slowed sharply in May, mainly
because of an unwinding of the tax-related run-up in April. So far this year, M2

has risen at a 6-1/2 percent annual rate, and M3 at a 6 percent annual rate, from
the fourth-quarter levels. Overall, the growth of bank credit remained weak in
May, but partial data suggest that it may be strengthening in June.
Business Finance
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations totaled $29 billion in May,
about the same strong pace as in earlier months this year. Junk bond issuance in
May was the largest in almost a year and accounted for nearly half the month's
total offerings. The rise in bond rates in late May led a number of investment-
grade and junk firms to postpone scheduled bond offerings. However, issuers
jumped back into the market when rates fell at the end of last week, and the
forward calendar remains sizable.
Short- and intermediate-term business credit has expanded at a slower pace than
in the first quarter. Business loans contracted in May, more than erasing a
modest increase in April, but have turned up in early June. Commercial paper
outstanding was up in May, following a small increase in April; so far in June,
commercial paper has risen moderately.
Credit quality in the corporate business sector, while still strong overall, has
slipped a bit further. The default rate for junk bonds has trended up since the
start of the year. Business failures, after surging in April, moderated in May and
then picked up again in June. On a twelve-month basis, they show a rise from
1998, but remain low by the standards of this decade. Downgrades of bonds of
nonfinancial firms outpaced upgrades by a small amount during May and the
first half of June. However, looking ahead, Moody's Watchlist suggests little
further net deterioration in the near term, as the dollar value of debt on review
for upgrades about matches that for downgrades.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was strong in May, totaling
about $10 billion, the largest amount in nearly a year. Both seasoned offerings
and IPOs picked up. Although the volume of scheduled offerings remains large,
equity issuance so far in June has slowed, held down by weak advances in equity
prices and by some reduced enthusiasm for Internet-related offerings.
Equity retirements associated with cash-financed mergers remained low in May.
Nonetheless, announcements of such mergers continue to be numerous, and the
backlog of pending deals suggests that equity retirements will pick up soon.
Announcements of share repurchases so far this year imply a slight moderation
from the pace of equity retirements in 1998, when actual repurchases by
nonfinancial firms totaled a record $169 billion.

Changes in major indexes of stock prices have been mixed since the previous
FOMC meeting. The DJIA is down slightly, although it is up 17 percent for the
year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are roughly unchanged, and are
about 2 to 3 percent off their highs reached earlier in the spring. The prices of
Internet stocks slid about 8 percent over the intermeeting period, bringing them
about 16 percent below their earlier peaks, but still up 40 percent for the year.
Equity prices have held up quite well in recent months in the face of rising
interest rates. Support has come from surprisingly strong first-quarter earnings
and anticipation of even better second-quarter earnings. Analysts currently
expect second-quarter S&P 500 earnings per share to be about 8-1/2 percent
higher than four quarters earlier, up from a 6-3/4 percent increase in the first
quarter.' There have been only sporadic earnings warnings thus far, which is
usually viewed as a bullish signal. The S&P 500 twelve-month forward
earnings-price ratio has moved up in June, but it remains near its record low in
April. Moreover, the gap between the forward earnings-price ratio and the real
thirty-year Treasury yield is at its narrowest for the twenty-one years such data
are available.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Commercial mortgage lending appears to have slowed in the second quarter.
Banks' holdings of commercial mortgages grew near a 5-1/2 percent average
annual rate in April and May, less than half the rate posted in the first quarter.
Conduit lenders, citing resistance to higher mortgage rates, continue to report
difficulties in originating commercial loans, and sector analysts have revised
down their forecasts for the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities
in coming months.
Gross CMBS issuance backed by previously originated loans is expected to be
$13-1/2 billion in the second quarter, down from $16 billion in the first quarter.
About half of the second-quarter securities were issued in late May, perhaps
putting some pressure on spreads of highly rated CMBS securities. On balance,
such spreads are up 16 to 18 basis points over the intermeeting period. In
contrast, spreads on lower-rated CMBS securities have tightened of late, as new
investors have entered the market in pursuit of yield.
Credit performance in the commercial mortgage sector continues to look good.
At life insurance companies, delinquency rates for commercial mortgage loans
dropped to their lowest level since 1965, when the American Council of Life
1. A measure of earnings per share that accounts for changes in the composition of firms
included in the S&P 500 index is expected to increase 11 percent over the year ended in
1992:Q2, up from the 9-1/2 percent rise in the previous quarter.

Insurance began compiling the data. Delinquency rates for commercial
mortgage loans at banks also touched a new low in the first quarter.
Equity prices for real estate investment trusts were little changed over the
intermeeting period, as enthusiasm for REIT shares fizzled quickly in May.
Activity by REITs has been limited; equity issuance in March and April was
weak, and REIT property acquisitions in April were the lowest since October
1995.
Household Finance
Household wealth has scored another solid increase in the second quarter, with
capital gains on stock holdings and real estate pushing the ratio of household net
worth to disposable income to a new high. At the same time, households have
provided mixed signals about their preferences for risk. Net inflows to equity
mutual funds are estimated to have been $15 billion in May, well below the
rapid pace in April but still above the first-quarter rate. Weekly data through
mid-June point to moderate inflows again this month. Investors shifted away
from high-yield bond funds, withdrawing, on net, $1-1/2 billion in May--the first
monthly outflow since last December--a pattern that has continued through
mid-June. Households with 401(k) plans allocated funds to safer investments,
with new contributions to fixed-income investments jumping to nearly
25 percent of total contributions in May from only 16 percent in April.
However, transfers of existing 401(k) assets were primarily out of fixed-income
funds and into company stock. On net, in May, such transfers and contributions
favored equities over fixed-income assets.
Data for the second quarter suggest that household debt growth has slowed from
the 9-1/2 percent annual pace over the previous two quarters. Consumer credit
grew at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate in April, well below the average pace in the
first quarter, and loans extended by banks to individuals contracted in May.
Though down from its recent rapid pace, growth in home mortgage debt appears
to have remained sizable in the second quarter, in keeping with continued
strength in housing activity. Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association
purchase index has risen sharply since the May FOMC meeting, despite
increases in interest rates. The contract interest rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate
mortgage was 7.65 percent last week, 55 basis points above the level at the time
of the May FOMC meeting. More recent indicators suggest that home mortgage
rates have retraced about one-quarter of that increase.
On balance, household credit performance has improved slightly this year.
Consumer loan delinquencies reported by banks on the Call Report and the
American Bankers Association survey edged down in the first quarter, while
measures of credit card delinquencies at banks were mixed. Delinquency rates

for loans at the captive auto finance companies and for credit card receivables
that back securities continued to decline in April. Personal bankruptcy filings
dropped sharply during the first quarter, more than retracing the run-up at the
end of last year. The 1998 increase appears to have been boosted by efforts to
file cases ahead of proposed legislation that would limit the ability of certain
debtors to obtain forgiveness for their obligations.2
Government Securities Markets
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury issued, on net, $15 billion of
marketable securities to meet seasonal fluctuations in the cash balance. Gross
issuance was concentrated in the shorter maturities, with $90 billion raised in
three- and six-month bills and $20 billion sold in one-year bills. Demand for the
only coupon security auctioned during the intermeeting period, the two-year
note, was greater than expected and stronger than in the most recent midquarter
refunding. Apparently, the shorter maturity securities were more appealing to
investors concerned with the prospects of the Fed tightening.
In light of strong inflows of tax receipts, the Treasury expects to pay down a
record $116 billion of marketable securities, on net, for the second quarter as a
whole. Even so, the Treasury cash balance is projected to be a sizable
$52 billion on June 30.
The Treasury again stated that it is considering steps to alleviate concerns that
debt paydowns are impinging on liquidity of on-the-run Treasury securities. An
approach that has been used successfully in the past is to reduce the number of
auctions, thereby increasing the available dollar amount of on-the-run Treasury
securities at each auction. A more unusual program, for which details have not
been provided to the public, would allow the Treasury to issue more on-the-run
Treasuries and use part of the proceeds to repurchase its off-the-run securities,
thus raising the share of on-the-run securities relative to total Treasury debt.
Canada has recently inaugurated such a program in the context of its own budget
surpluses.
Government-sponsored enterprises continued to issue large blocks of benchmark
securities over the intermeeting period as part of their ongoing attempt to take
advantage of the vacuum created by the shrinking volume of Treasury securities.
Since mid-May, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks
have together sold close to $16 billion in benchmark securities. Also, Fannie
Mae issued its first thirty-year benchmark bond and plans to offer at least two
benchmark bonds each year. In an effort to compete with Fannie Mae's and

Freddie Mac's large, liquid issues, the FHLBs increased the minimum issue size
of their jumbo notes from $1 billion to $3 billion. The heavy supply of
benchmark agency securities and greater uncertainty in financial markets have
been accompanied by a widening of the securities' spreads relative to on-the-run
Treasuries. Since the May FOMC meeting, spreads have widened 15 basis
points, to about 67 basis points.
Municipal Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds totaled about $16 billion in May,
close to April's pace but down from the strong first-quarter rate. New capital
issuance picked up in May after having been temporarily depressed during tax
season, when investor demand tends to wane. Funding needs for education and
transportation projects continued to account for the bulk of issuance. Advance
refundings fell further in May, as rising yields reduced profitable refinancing
opportunities.
Yields on long-term municipal bonds have risen 18 to 24 basis points over the
intermeeting period, about in line with those on comparable Treasuries.
Credit quality of municipal debt issuers remains strong. During May and early
June, Standard & Poor's upgraded considerably more issues than it downgraded,
continuing the pattern of net upgrades that has prevailed over the past few years.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates slowed in May after rising briskly in
April. Liquid deposits, which had surged in April in anticipation of tax
payments, expanded at a more modest rate in May, reflecting the clearing of
those payments in late April and in early May. M2 decelerated to a
4-1/2 percent annual rate in May.
Growth of M3 also moved down to a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in May, bringing
growth for the year down to just below 6 percent at an annual rate. The
deceleration in May partly reflects smaller inflows into institution-only money
market mutual funds. More important, M3 growth was held down by a decline
in large time deposits due largely to a limited need for funding by banks.
Growth in bank credit, adjusted for mark-to-market accounting, picked up a
little in May, but only to a sluggish 3 percent pace, and appears to have
strengthened more in June. Securities holdings at banks increased slightly, as
banks continued to run off mortgage-backed securities of government-sponsored
agencies. However, data for early June indicate that securities holdings have
picked up appreciably. Loan growth was modest in May but appears a bit
stronger in early June. Commercial and industrial loans contracted sharply in

May, mainly because of securitizations. Nevertheless, even after adjusting for
securitizations, business loans fell 2 percent in May. Results from the May
Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicate that banks may have become
slightly more cautious lenders. Spreads on business loans relative to the
intended federal funds rate have risen across all risk categories since February,
with larger increases for loans with higher risk ratings. Also, delinquencies and
charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans ticked up further in the first
quarter, although they remain at low levels. Consumer loans on banks' books
also declined sharply in May, reflecting brisk securitizations and a notable drop
in originations, but appear to have remained flat in June. In contrast, growth in
real estate loans accelerated in May and early June, likely because of a weaker
pace of securitizations than in previous months.

Trade in Goods and Services
For the first quarter of 1999, the nominal U.S. trade deficit in goods and services
was $215 billion SAAR, substantially larger than for any quarter in 1998, as
exports fell and imports rose strongly. In April, the U.S. trade deficit was $18.9
billion, nearly the same as recorded in the previous two months, with exports
and imports both edging up.

The value of exports in the first quarter was 2 percent lower than in the fourth
quarter. A good part of the decline reflected a reversal of the surge in exports of
aircraft and automotive products that occurred at the end of last year. Exports to
countries in Asia were generally lower in the first quarter than in the fourth
quarter, because the level of exports in the fourth quarter had been boosted by
record year-end deliveries of aircraft to that region. Exports in April increased
somewhat, following declines in the previous five months. Exports of
computers and semiconductors turned up moderately, and there were small
increases in most other major trade categories.
The value of imports in the first quarter was 2 percent higher than in the fourth
quarter, with the largest increases in automotive products, consumer goods, and
machinery. In contrast, the value of imported oil dropped 8 percent, primarily
because of sharp price declines prior to February. Total imports rose moderately
in April, but the increase was more than accounted for by a sharp jump in the
value of oil imports, mostly as a result of higher oil prices. There were small-to-
moderate increases in imports of most other major trade categories. The
exception was a large decline in imports of automotive products from Canada
and Mexico that partly reversed steady increases recorded in previous months.

Quantity and price of imported oil. The quantity of imported oil edged up in
the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, and rose further in April due to
strong inventory demand. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate
that imports in May increased modestly. The price of imported oil rose 20
percent in April (to around $13.50 per barrel) following an 11 percent increase
in March. These price increases were largely driven by a March agreement by
OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce supply by two million barrels per
day.
After trading near $19 per barrel in early May, spot WTI fell about $2.50 per
barrel in response to surprisingly high exports from Russia, higher production
from Nigeria, and high global product inventories. Spot WTI averaged $17.75
per barrel in May. More recently, oil prices have rebounded somewhat on news
that OPEC's compliance with production cuts is near 90 percent. Spot WTI is
currently trading around $18 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. For April and May combined, prices of
non-oil imports decreased 2 percent at an annual rate, a somewhat larger rate of
decline than in the previous two quarters. Prices of "core" imports declined 1-
1/2 percent at an annual rate following two quarters of virtually no price change.
The decline in core prices reflected a swing from increases to decreases in the
prices of machinery and consumer goods combined with smaller (or zero)
declines in prices of imported industrial supplies and foods. Prices of
automotive products rose slightly.
For April and May combined, prices of exports were about unchanged from the
first quarter level compared to 1 to 2 percent declines in the first and fourth
quarters. Although prices of agricultural exports recently turned up, the April
and May average was still well below that of the first quarter. Prices of "core"
exports rose 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate in April and May combined led by
increases in chemicals and metals. This increase followed little change in "core"
export prices in the first quarter and a decline of 1 percent AR in the fourth
quarter of 1998.
Price data for June will be released on July 13.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit increased to $274 billion (SAAR) in the first
quarter of 1999. The deficit for goods and services widened, while the deficit
for net unilateral transfers narrowed and the deficit on income was little
changed. The larger deficit for goods and services reflected a wider trade deficit,
as exports fell and imports rose; the surplus on services edged up as receipts rose
more than payments increased. The reduction in net unilateral transfers in the
first quarter reflected lower U.S. government grant disbursements, which were
boosted in the fourth quarter by the annual payment of grants to Israel.
As is customary each June, estimates of U.S. international transactions were
revised to incorporate updated source data and improved methodologies. These
revisions lowered the deficit $12 to $13 billion in 1997 and 1998 and had
varying effects on deficits in other years. Most of this revision reflected higher
estimated portfolio investment receipts, owing to new data from the end-1997
outward portfolio survey, which raised considerably the estimates of U.S.
holdings of foreign securities. Also this year, changes were made to the
presentation of the current account to be more consistent with the presentation of
the NIPA accounts. The "net income" category has replaced "net investment
income" and includes compensation of employees, previously included in
services. In addition, a small part of the previous measure of unilateral transfers
was removed and is now included in the new capital account measure.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserves held in the United States increased marginally in April
(line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Decreases in
assets of industrial countries, particularly Western Europe and Canada, were
offset by increases in developing countries in Latin America and Asia. Reserves
of Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela registered significant increases, while
Mexican reserves increased moderately. Increased reserves were also reported
for China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Overall, reduced foreign official
holdings of Treasury securities were more than matched by increases in foreign
official claims on U.S. banks, and to a lesser extent, increases in foreign official
holdings of U.S. government agency bonds. Partial data through May from the
FRBNY indicate a slight reduction last month in total foreign official reserves
held in the United States.
In sharp contrast to recent periods, banks reported large net outflows in April of
$27 billion (line 3). These outflows were reported almost entirely by U.S.
agencies and branches of foreign-based banks and were attributed largely to the
unwinding of borrowing from, or increased lending to, related offices in the
Caribbean financial centers and Japan. U.S. agencies and branches reduced their

IV-7
assets (especially C&I loans) in April. At the same time, they increased their
issuance of large time deposits. (The premium that Japanese banks had been
paying to issue large CDs fell from around 20 basis points to zero in mid-
March.)

Private foreigners bought net $32 billion of U.S. securities in April, up slightly
from March (line 4). Although both total U.S. bond issuance and U.S. issues
abroad decreased significantly in April, net foreign purchases of U.S. corporate
and other bonds were $19 billion, only moderately below the March level.
Purchases of corporate bonds were concentrated in the U.K. and Caribbean
financial centers. Large net purchases of U.S. federally-sponsored agency bonds
were also reported in those same markets and in Japan. Foreigners' appetite for
U.S. equities was very robust in April. Net purchases were registered at $18
billion as compared to $11 billion for the first quarter. Activity in U.S. stocks
was strongest in Western Europe, the Caribbean financial centers, and Japan.
Holdings of Treasury securities declined somewhat, principally by Western
European investors.
U.S. residents continued to be net sellers of foreign securities in April (line 5) as
net purchases of $3 billion of foreign bonds were more than offset by net sales of

IV-8
$6 billion of foreign stocks. Large net purchases of foreign bonds were recorded
vis-a-vis Argentina, Mexico, and Korea. Significant net purchases of foreign
stocks vis-a-vis Japan ($3.4 billion) were overwhelmed by net sales elsewhere,
particularly in the United Kingdom.
Recently-released balance of payments data for 1999:Q1 show a sharp reduction
in foreign direct investment flows into the United States (line 7). Inflows in
1998:Q4 were swollen by several extraordinarily large takeovers; and the
1999:Q1 figures represent a return to more normal levels. U.S. direct
investment abroad accelerated in 1999:Q1 (line 6), bringing it above last year's
record-setting pace.
Net U.S. currency shipments decreased to $2.4 billion in 1999:Q1 from $6.3
billion in 1998:Q4 (line 8).
The statistical discrepancy, which reflects the errors and omissions in recorded
transactions in both the current and capital account, was an outflow of some $16
billion in 1999:Q1, down somewhat from the $38 billion outflow in 1998:Q4.
This discrepancy implies either an overstatement of net capital inflows or an
understatement of net current account outflows.

Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period since the May FOMC meeting, the exchange value of the dollar
experienced pronounced upward and downward fluctuations against most
currencies, appreciating about 1.4 percent on balance in terms of the major
currencies index. The dollar depreciated 1 percent on balance against the yen
and appreciated 3.6 percent against the euro.

The dollar's weakening against the yen over the period was accompanied by a 17
basis point narrowing of the yield spread between U.S. and Japanese 10-year
government debt. The leak and ultimate release of Japanese GDP data on June
10, showing that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 7.9 percent in the
first quarter, evidently took most market participants by complete surprise and
led to an immediate strengthening of the yen. Earlier talk of further fiscal
stimulus measures also provided some support for the yen. Japan's monetary
authorities intervened on four occasions late in the period, buying exceptionally
large amounts of dollars and euros, to stem the currency's appreciation. Share
prices in Japan have surged more than 7 percent since the May FOMC meeting.
Short-term Japanese interest rates have remained near zero, as the Bank of Japan
continues its efforts to support economic activity through ample provision of
liquidity.

The dollar's strengthening against the euro over the intermeeting period
continued a trend that began almost immediately after the inception of the new
currency in January. As in the preceding intermeeting periods, the dollar's rise
vis-à-vis the euro was accompanied by a widening of U.S. dollar and euro-area
government bond yield differentials, as signals of ongoing robust growth in the
United States contrasted with indications of sub-par economic activity on
average in the eurozone countries. The Bank of England lowered its repo rate 25
basis points, noting that price pressures appeared well contained and that U.K.
economic growth had slowed considerably in the first quarter. Share prices in
eurozone countries and the United Kingdom have risen more than 5 percent
since the May FOMC meeting. On balance, the dollar appreciated more than 3
percent against sterling, with most of this change occurring late in the period.
Latin American financial markets experienced several bouts of increased stress,
which were caused both by home-grown problems, such as uncertainty over the
commitment of Argentine authorities to maintaining the currency board regime
and the slowing progress towards fiscal reform in Brazil. Expectations for higher
global interest rates following the FOMC's announcement of the adoption of a
tightening bias at the May meeting also contributed to the stress in these
markets. Brady bond stripped spreads spiked higher in May and early June. On
balance, Brazilian and Argentine Brady bond spreads remain 60 to 110 basis
points above levels recorded in mid-May, while Mexican and Venezuelan Brady
spreads are little changed. The real has depreciated about 6 percent against the

The price of gold slumped another 15 dollars, to below $260 per troy ounce, as
market participants continued to focus on the announcement made by U.K.
authorities that they would sell off more than half of the country's monetary gold
reserves in coming years.

IV-13
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent economic developments in the major foreign industrialized countries
suggest that GDP growth may have strengthened somewhat. Signs of
improvement were evident in Germany, where final domestic demand was
strong in the first quarter and the drag coming from net exports considerably
reduced relative to the fourth quarter of 1998. For the euro area overall, the
pickup in growth was more modest, as Germany's better performance was
partially offset by the slowing growth of domestic demand in France. In the
United Kingdom, data for the second quarter suggest that activity has picked up
after two quarters of very little growth. In Japan, real GDP rose a surprising 7.9
percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, but the extent to which this strong number
represents a shift toward sustained improvement is unclear. The sharp rise in
GDP contradicts an unemployment rate that continues to rise and other
indications that the economy remains stagnant.
With the exception of an uptick in CPI inflation in Canada, inflationary
pressures remain subdued. In Japan, consumer prices remain below year-earlier
levels, while twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area has edged
up but is still near 1 percent. In the United Kingdom, concerns that inflation
might be trending below its target prompted the Bank of England to cut interest
rates 25 basis points in June.
In Japan, the surge in real GDP in the first quarter marked the first quarterly
growth in a year and a half and brought GDP back to its 1998Q1 level. All
components of domestic demand increased robustly. Private consumption and
residential investment each rose about 5 percent (SAAR), business fixed
investment was up more than 10 percent, and public investment surged at almost
a 50 percent rate for the second consecutive quarter, with public demand
contributing more than 4 percentage points to GDP growth. External demand
subtracted 1 percentage point from growth, with exports contracting slightly and
imports expanding 7.5 percent, after seven consecutive quarterly declines.
Indicators for the second quarter provide little evidence of further expansion.
Industrial production during April was down 3.4 percent (not annualized) from
March and down 1.3 percent from the first-quarter average. April private "core"
machinery orders plunged to a ten-year low, falling 11.1 percent below the first-
quarter average. Labor market conditions also remained depressed, with
unemployment at an all-time high of 4.8 percent in both March and April and the
offers-to-applicants ratio remaining near an all-time low. The real household

expenditure series in April rebounded modestly from a plunge during the first
quarter, but new car registrations during the second quarter have slowed from
their first-quarter pace. The twelve-month Tokyo CPI inflation rate fell to -0.6
percent in May, suggesting the continued presence of deflationary pressures.
Japan's trade surplus during the first five months of 1999 was $110 billion at an
annual rate, essentially unchanged from the $108 billion surplus during all of
1998. Denominated in dollars, merchandise imports and merchandise exports
during the first five months of the year were almost identical to their 1998
averages.
In mid-June, the government announced a package of measures intended to
address rising unemployment and encourage firm restructuring. The package
aims to create 700,000 new jobs, mainly through public subsidies and other
government-sponsored job creation measures. The package also includes
proposals to strengthen worker retraining programs and increase the duration
and generosity of unemployment benefits. To facilitate corporate restructuring,
the package calls for debt-for-equity swaps, in which banks would forgive
enterprise loans in exchange for shares, and legal reforms to streamline
bankruptcy proceedings and facilitate firm restructuring. The measures in this
package will be funded by a supplemental budget expected to total about ¥500
billion (0.1 percent of GDP)
The eleven European Union countries in the euro zone registered growth of 1.7
percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, according to preliminary estimates
from Eurostat. The pace of real economic activity has picked up following the
slowdown at the end of last year, mainly due to better German performance.
However, France and Italy have slowed, and, as a group, the three countries still
appear to be growing below potential and more slowly than many other euro-
area countries.
German first-quarter growth owed entirely to broad-based strength in domestic
demand. Strong gains in private consumption, government spending, and fixed
investment were tempered by a sharp reduction in the pace of inventory
accumulation.
In France, domestic demand slowed sharply from its robust pace in the fourth
quarter. Although fixed investment spending was unexpectedly strong,
consumption and government spending posted only modest gains. Net exports
subtracted slightly from first-quarter growth.

Little information is available for the second quarter. Unemployment rates in
the euro area have fallen in recent months. In Germany, industrial production
moved up in April, suggesting that the recovery in the first quarter may be
continuing there. In contrast, industrial production in France and Italy declined
significantly in April, indicating a continuing slowdown in France and no sign
of reversal in the weak pace of economic activity in Italy.
Price pressures continue to be mild. Twelve-month consumer price inflation for
the euro area edged up to 1.1 percent in April, reflecting the effects of higher oil
prices and the decline in the value of the euro.
Forward-looking indicators for the euro area are suggestive of continued
recovery in industry, but are less positive for household spending. Consumer
confidence edged down further in May, likely in reaction to the Kosovo conflict.
Confidence in the construction sector remains low but has improved steadily
since the end of 1998. Higher production expectations have helped boost
confidence in the industrial sector in recent months. Still, industrial confidence
remains near lows registered in the first quarter.

In late May, the ECOFIN Council, which is composed of finance ministers of
the fifteen member states in the European Union, approved a proposal submitted
by Italian Finance Minister Amato to change the official fiscal deficit target for
1999 from 2 percent of GDP to a maximum of 2.4 percent of GDP. The
revision to Italy's budget deficit was due to a reduction in the official growth
projection for 1999 in light of disappointing growth so far this year. This
decision weighed on the euro, as it generated concern about prospects for fiscal
discipline in Europe.
Economic activity in the United Kingdom remained very weak in the first
quarter, with real GDP essentially unchanged from its fourth-quarter level.
Consumption expenditures grew a robust 4.5 percent (SAAR), the strongest rate
in more than a year. Government spending was also up sharply, but investment
spending declined after growing at double-digit rates in the previous two
quarters and inventories subtracted about 3/4 percentage point from growth. Net
exports made a significant negative contribution to growth for the sixth
consecutive quarter, as exports fell and imports rose moderately.

Preliminary indicators suggest that the pace of activity picked up in the second
quarter. Industrial production edged up further in April to a level 0.4 percent
above the first-quarter average. Business surveys through May point to renewed
expansion of activity, and business confidence through May has risen sharply
from very low levels late last year. For April and May on average, the volume
of retail sales was up 0.6 percent from the first-quarter average.

IV-19
Conditions in the labor market remain healthy. The official unemployment rate
was unchanged at 4.5 percent in May, and the Labor Force Survey
unemployment rate edged down to 6.2 percent for the February-April period as
employment expanded modestly.

The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
rates) fell to 2.1 percent in May, the lowest inflation rate in over four years.
Producer input prices for materials and fuel edged up in April, but were little
changed in May. On a twelve-month basis, input prices were down 2.6 percent
in May.
With sterling stronger than expected, the Monetary Policy Committee of the
Bank of England voted to reduce the repo rate 25 basis points to 5 percent at its
June meeting. The MPC had noted in May that if sterling did not depreciate as
expected, "further easing of monetary policy might be needed to prevent
undershooting of the inflation target."
Canadian GDP rose 4.2 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, maintaining the
vigorous pace of the previous quarter. Robust U.S. demand for Canadian
products continued to fuel activity, as export growth remained strong and net
exports contributed 1.8 percent towards growth in the first quarter. Domestic
demand rose 3.3 percent, as firms expanded their workforce and augmented

IV-20
their capital stock sharply to keep pace with the strong external demand. These
sizable employment gains helped boost consumer spending by over 5 percent in
the quarter. Partially offsetting this pickup in fixed investment and
consumption, inventory investment slowed to a more sustainable pace following
the rebuilding of strike-depleted inventories in the fourth quarter of 1998.

Recent indicators suggest that growth has slowed from the 4.2 percent pace of
the first quarter. Employment in April and May on average was down from its
level in the first quarter. Gains in consumer spending also appear to have
moderated, as retail sales fell 0.4 percent in April. New orders of manufactured
goods fell sharply in both March and April, albeit from a high level. However,
substantial improvements in consumer and business confidence imply that any
abatement in the pace of activity may be modest.
Twelve-month CPI inflation has risen sharply in recent months mainly as a
result of higher energy prices. At the same time, the twelve-month change in
core prices (which exclude energy and food prices) also rose from slightly below
1 percent in February to 1.4 percent in May. This increase in core inflation
along with the announcement of a tightening bias by the Federal Reserve has led
to a sharp turnaround in market expectations regarding future policy actions by
the Bank of Canada. Following these events, futures contracts on Bankers'
Acceptances priced in over 50 basis points of tightening by the Bank of Canada
by September of this year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
There is increasing evidence that the international financial crisis may be
abating, although its effects on economic activity in Latin America are far from
over. In Brazil and Mexico, output growth appears to have recovered somewhat,
inflation has remained subdued, and the trade surplus has improved.
Venezuela's economy may be bottoming out, although prospects remain
precarious. In Argentina, pressures in financial markets have recently
resurfaced; GDP contracted sharply in the first quarter, deflation has intensified,
and imports have fallen sharply.
In developing Asia, Korea and the ASEAN economies appear to be recovering
particularly strongly from last year's deep recession. Growth remained strong in
Taiwan, and in China, industrial production remains firm. In Hong Kong, GDP
fell further in the first quarter, but financial market pressures have lessened
markedly in recent months, suggesting improved prospects. Trade surpluses in
Korea, the ASEAN countries, and China are falling as imports have begun to
rebound. Inflation throughout developing Asia has remained moderate or
declined, with more rapid deflation in Hong Kong.
In Russia, GDP rose in the first quarter, inflation has remained steady, and the
trade surplus remains strong. The political landscape remains a concern.
In Brazil, recent data suggest that economic activity may have bottomed out.
Real GDP posted surprisingly strong growth in the first quarter (SAAR), boosted
by special factors such as phenomenally high growth in agriculture (reflecting in
part an early harvest). However, industrial production fell slightly in April, after
rising in March, and unemployment has remained high by historical standards.
The weak economy has helped keep inflationary pressures at bay; the CPI has
risen by less than 4 percent since the end of January, after the real's peg to the
dollar was abandoned.
The trade balance has improved less than expected following the large
depreciation of the real; the trade balance shifted from a deficit of $6-1/2 billion
in 1998 to a small surplus over the February-May period (SAAR). Although
imports fell 18 percent, exports also fell by 7 percent. The decline in exports
reflects weak demand from Argentina and other Latin trading partners and a fall
in world prices of many primary commodity exports.
Developments since mid-May have fueled concerns that the fiscal reforms may
be stalling. Various court challenges to reforms passed by Congress earlier this
year have called into question about 1 percentage point of the fiscal adjustment
that had been expected for 1999. The privatizations of several state government
electricity firms have been postponed under pressures from workers and other

IV-26
privatization opponents. Finally, President Cardoso's approval rating has fallen
to its lowest level ever amid increasing infighting among members of his fragile
political coalition. These developments contributed heavily to a rise in market
interest rates over late May and early June, despite surprisingly low inflation and
the continued gradual reduction in the central bank's overnight lending rate, the
Selic rate. The Selic rate has fallen from 45 percent in early March to 22 percent
recently. All indications are that Brazil has so far satisfied all of the
performance criteria under its IMF program, including fiscal targets. The IMF is
in the process of reviewing recent performance and setting performance criteria
for the rest of the year.

Recent Mexican data suggest that the economy continues to recover from its
slowdown in the fourth quarter of 1998. Although industrial production fell
slightly in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, it has risen since the beginning
of the year. The trade deficit has narrowed since the beginning of the year, as
maquiladora exports to the United States were strong, and petroleum prices
surged from their depressed levels at the beginning of the year. Consumer prices
in May rose at their slowest pace since 1994 as spending remained sluggish
while the peso's strength kept import prices down. Since December, inflation
has been 15.6 percent (SAAR), about a percentage point lower than the rate over
the same period in 1998.

The new Bank Deposit Insurance Institute (IPAB), which was created to rescue
the bank bailout fund, announced on June 1 the transition timetable for limiting
deposit insurance to about $100,000 per account by the year 2005. The IPAB
also established rules for bank contributions to the insurance fund and is
determining the process for selling bank assets acquired during the 1995 peso
crisis. In what may be the first test of its ability to resolve lingering banking
sector problems, the IPAB announced on June 18 that Grupo Financiero Serfin
SA, Mexico's third largest banking group, will be taken over by the government
and auctioned off if current shareholders are unwilling to recapitalize the bank
themselves.
On June 15, Mexico announced that it is requesting a $4.1 billion 17-month
standby agreement from the International Monetary Fund. The new loan, which
is likely to be approved by the IMF Executive Board in early July, is part of a
larger effort by Mexico to cover the major portion of its outstanding external
debt payments through the next presidential election in the fall of 2000. Over
the next year, Mexico will receive additional credit of $5.2 billion from the
World Bank, $3.5 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank, and
$4.0 billion from the U.S. Eximbank. Moreover, the $6.8 billion swap facility

IV-28
with Canada ($800 million), the U.S. Treasury ($3 billion), and the Federal
Reserve ($3 billion) has been renewed through December 2000 under the North
American Framework Agreement.
In recent weeks, financial markets in Mexico have seesawed as investors first
grew nervous over the Fed's announcement of a bias toward tightening and then
were calmed by the news of Mexico's likely agreement with the IMF. On
May 25, the peso depreciated 2.2 percent to 9.6 pesos per dollar, and the Bank of
Mexico responded by selling $65 million to stabilize the currency. Since
June 15, however, markets have rallied on the news of Mexico's extended credit
lines and expectations of only a mild hike in U.S. interest rates. Interest rates on
the benchmark 28-day Mexican treasury bills (cetes) fell 124 basis points to
yield 20.48 percent at the June 22 auction, while the peso appreciated nearly
2 percent to 9.3 pesos per dollar.
In Argentina, pressures in financial markets have recently resurfaced and data
on economic activity confirm that the recession continues. In the first quarter,
seasonally adjusted GDP fell for the third straight quarter. Industrial production
grew in April from the previous month (SA) but was nevertheless about
12 percent lower than a year earlier; in the first quarter, industrial production
was down sharply from the fourth quarter last year. Exports continued to
decline, but the sharp slowdown in economic activity caused imports to decline
by more, thus narrowing external imbalances. March's trade surplus was the
first surplus since early 1997. With weak aggregate demand, consumer prices
fell in May for the fourth consecutive month.
Campaigning for the October presidential elections is underway. Uncertainty
about politics and about the future of Argentina's currency peg (including the
dollarization proposal) has led to a modest increase in interest rates since mid-
May. President Menem has expressed interest in moving quickly on official
dollarization and having the process underway before he leaves office in
December. However, political support for immediate dollarization appears
weak--the likely presidential candidate from Menem's own Peronist party (rival
Eduardo Duhalde, the governor of the Buenos Aires province) and the
presidential candidate of the opposition Alliance party have both recently spoken
out in favor of maintaining the convertibility of the Argentine peso to the U.S.
dollar, but against the idea of dollarization.

With the recent rise in oil prices, the Venezuelan economy is improving slowly,
but still remains precarious. Car sales in May rose nearly 20 percent from April,
but nevertheless were down 50 percent from their year earlier. The 12-month
inflation rate continued to decline slowly in May but, with the bolivar not
allowed by the government to depreciate as rapidly, the real exchange rate
continues to appreciate and become further overvalued. While the overall trade
balance remains in surplus, the non-oil trade deficit fell to -$8.4 billion in
February (SAAR).
Venezuela has decided not to try to sign the monitoring agreement with the IMF
that, until recently, it was actively seeking. It appears the government feels that
the stringent conditions for such an agreement--including a rise in gasoline
prices, extensive government spending cuts, and steps toward a more
competitive exchange rate--are too costly politically, as President Chavez
prepares for the July 25 election of a new constituent assembly that would have
the power to change the constitution. It is generally believed that the lack of an
IMF agreement will make it very difficult for the government to raise a proposed
$2 billion on international capital markets later this year designed to help cover
the budget deficit.

In Korea, the pace of the recovery appears to have accelerated further. Real
GDP increased at nearly a 15 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first
quarter. Domestic demand rose, as a strong increase in consumption more than
offset a further decline in fixed investment. Industrial production declined in
April, but reversed only one-third of the very strong rise of the previous month.
The unemployment rate declined to 6.4 percent in May, well below its peak late
last year of over 8 percent. Despite the recent increase in the pace of activity,
inflation has remained subdued, with consumer prices less than 1 percent above
their year-earlier level.
The trade and current account surpluses have continued to shrink as imports
have risen with the revival of activity. The current account surplus in the first
four months of this year was nearly 40 percent below the surplus in the
corresponding period last year.
Despite progress, government efforts to restructure the financial system remain
far from complete. The Financial Supervisory Commission announced that non-
performing loans of financial institutions were 11 percent of total loans at the
end of the first quarter, up slightly from end-1998. With a stricter definition of
non-performing loans going into effect at the end of the year, this figure is
expected to rise significantly further. The previously announced sale of
government-owned Seoul Bank to Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has been

IV-31
delayed due to disputes over the terms of the sale. The other planned sale of a
Korean bank to foreign interests--the acquisition of Korea First Bank by
Newbridge Capital-collapsed last month due to similar disagreements.

Recent indicators for the ASEAN countries provide further evidence that
economic activity in the region has bottomed out and a recovery has begun.
First quarter GDP growth was stronger than expected in Indonesia, the
Phillippines and Singapore. Industrial production in Malaysia and Singapore
rose significantly, reflecting renewed vigor in the electronics sector, while
industrial production in Thailand and the Philippines began to accelerate.
Notwithstanding increasing export values across the region, trade surpluses have
begun to narrow since late last year as import growth has resumed, with the
Philippines even recording a trade deficit in April.
ASEAN financial markets have surged recently as signals of an economic
recovery have begun to emerge. The region's currencies have remained firm,
while the Indonesian rupiah has strengthened on optimism about prospects for
political and economic reforms following national elections in June. Inflation
continues to decline across the region, mainly reflecting weak domestic demand.

The Finance Ministry of Thailand stated that Thai banks will now be allowed to
retroactively use the equity portion of hybrid security issuances to meet previous
entry requirements for the government's tier-one recapitalization program. The
government of Singapore announced that it will open its retail banking sector to
foreign investors by issuing full banking licences to a limited number of foreign
banks and by raising the limit on foreign ownership of domestic banks.
In Hong Kong, real GDP continued its steady decline in the first quarter. The
unemployment rate rose to 6.3 percent in the March-May period, up from
6.0 percent in the December-February period. Consumer prices continue to fall
sharply. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in April from March.
Foreign exchange reserves were $89 billion at the end of May, down slightly
from April but nevertheless about $2 billion higher than their September low.
Spreads between one-year Hong Kong government debt and U.S. Treasuries
were around 80 basis points on June 22, roughly unchanged since mid-May, but
nevertheless down sharply from their levels of nearly 280 basis points in
January.

In China, industrial production growth remained relatively steady through April.
Moderate deflation continues, reflecting weak private demand as well as falling
import prices. The trade surplus has narrowed since the fourth quarter of 1998,
although it began widening again in May. The seasonally adjusted level of
exports, which fell sharply during 1998, have grown rapidly since the fourth
quarter. Exports in the March-May period (SA) were 5 percent higher than in
the December-February period. Over the same period, however, imports
surged--the seasonally adjusted level of imports rose 22 percent, after being
roughly flat since 1995. The strength in imports appears to reflect an anti-
smuggling campaign begun in the second half of last year. As a result of this
campaign, some smuggled imports that were previously unrecorded in the
customs statistics (and thus increased China's sizeable errors and omissions in
the balance of payments) are now passing through official import channels.
China cut interest rates in mid-June, hoping to encourage domestic spending.
Deposit rates were cut about 1-1/2 percentage points (to 2-1/4 percent for one-
year deposits), while lending rates were cut about /2 percentage point. The rate
cut, along with a reduction in taxes on stock transactions and an announcement
that more private companies would be allowed to list on the stock market,
contributed to surging Chinese share prices.

In Taiwan, real GDP rose strongly in the first quarter. The unemployment rate
was 2.8 percent in May, roughly unchanged from the beginning of the year.
Prices in May were slightly above their year-earlier level, ending several months
of deflation. Taiwan's trade surplus rose sharply in the first five months of
1999, with the value of exports rising 5 percent from a year earlier and the value
of imports falling 6 percent. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rose to

The Russian economy has begun to show some signs of improvement, but a
fractured political landscape continues to impede progress on reforms needed to
pull the economy out of its recession, secure economic stability, and obtain
funding from the IMF.
On the bright side, month-to-month inflation has remained steady at around
3 percent since March, industrial output was up 1.5 percent in the 12 months to
April, and GDP surged in the first quarter. The exchange rate has remained
under 25 rubles per dollar since mid-April and has even strengthened since mid-
March. The RTS stock index, up 65 percent this year, recently regained its pre-
crisis level in ruble terms. The weak ruble and rising oil prices have enabled
Russia to run large trade surpluses.

However, political instability, underscored by last month's sacking of the
Primakov government and the ongoing battle over IMF-required reforms,
continues to inhibit the ability of the authorities to consolidate economic gains
and restore confidence in the economy. Although Russia seems to have
successfully avoided any fallout from the sacking of Primakov and appointment
of Sergei Stepashin to the post of Prime Minister, it has become clear that the
legislature will neither quickly nor quietly pass key reforms on taxation and bank
restructuring. Russia may, however, be able to tolerate a delay in IMF

IV-37
disbursements, as the economy has outperformed expectations recently, enabling
reserves to rise $500 million over the past four weeks. Also, political
momentum for a restructuring of debts owed to bilateral and commercial
creditors appears to be gathering speed, as members of the G-7 move to improve
relations with Russia following the peace agreement in the Balkans.
