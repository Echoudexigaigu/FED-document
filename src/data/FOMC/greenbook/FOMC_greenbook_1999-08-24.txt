Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity appears to be expanding at least moderately in the current
quarter. Although some signs of a slackening in the pace of domestic final sales
growth have crept into the picture, lean inventories at midyear and a possible
boost to exports from improving growth abroad suggest a fairly solid trend in
overall demand. Employment gains have been very large of late, keeping the
labor market tight. But whether this has led in turn to increased cost pressures is
unclear: Certainly, with the exception of the energy sector, price inflation has
remained subdued and profit reports have been upbeat.
Real GDP
According to the BEA's advance estimate, real GDP rose at an annual rate of
2.3 percent in the second quarter. Subsequently, we have received additional
source data that point to a downward revision, perhaps to a shade under the
2 percent mark; lower estimates for personal consumption expenditures and
inventory accumulation account for the bulk of the expected revision. Unless
otherwise noted, the discussion ofsecond-quarter activity in the remainder of
this section of the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions to the GDP
data.
Labor Market Developments
Gains in nonfarm payrolls averaged about 290,000 in June and July, up from
an average of 195,000 over the first five months of the year. Still, with the
household survey showing a much more modest net gain in employment, the
jobless rate held in the neighborhood of about 4-1/4 percent, where it has been
since the turn of the year.
Manufacturing employment rose 31,000 in July, after having declined 36,000
in June. The gain last month was the first in sixteen months, apart from the
rebound at the end of the GM strike last summer. Of course, some caution is
appropriate before concluding that a turning point has been reached, given the
large seasonal movements in factory jobs that occur around this time of year
and other statistical uncertainties. Still, some other indicators of
manufacturing activity, such as the National Purchasing Managers' survey, do
suggest that some firming may indeed have occurred since the spring.
Construction payrolls increased about 20,000 in both June and July, in line
with the average monthly increases over the previous twelve-month period.
Hiring in the services-producing sector also was strong in June and July, with
the gains exceeding the average of the past year.

The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls edged back up 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours in June and held at
that level in July. Aggregate hours increased 0.3 percent in both June and
July. The level of hours last month was 0.6 percent above the second-quarter
average (not at an annual rate), suggesting that even with only modest growth
in August and September, the overall gain in production worker hours in the
third quarter could easily approach 3 percent at an annual rate.
The household survey and other labor market indicators continue to portray a
robust, taut labor market. The unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent in June and
July, has remained close to the 29-year low reached earlier this year. The
labor force participation rate, which was 67.0 percent in July, also has
changed little in recent months. The share of the population out of the labor
force but wanting a job continued to bounce around in the low zone that has
prevailed since the end of last year. In addition, the number of job leavers who
were unemployed for less than five weeks (as a percentage of household
employment) has been running higher of late, an indication, perhaps, that
workers perceive plentiful job opportunities--which certainly is what the
Conference Board consumer survey shows to be the case.
Among other indicators, initial claims for unemployment insurance since the
July reference week have been very low--the lowest in this decade, on
average. In the July National Federation of Independent Businesses' survey of
small businesses, the fraction of firms reporting that positions are hard to fill
and the net hiring strength index both remained high by historical standards.
According to the BLS's preliminary estimate, labor productivity in the
nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second
quarter of 1999, a smaller gain than in recent quarters. Hours in the nonfarm
business sector are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent
in the second quarter, while output moved up at a 2.4 percent rate.1 This
measure of output is calculated from the product side of the national accounts.
We do not have an "official" measure of nonfarm business output for the
second quarter from the income side of the accounts because NIPA profits
have yet to be published. However, if second-quarter economic profits edged
up from their first-quarter level--which appears roughly consistent with the
book value profits reports for S&P 500 companies--the resulting income-side
measures for the second-quarter increases in nonfarm business output and
productivity would be on the order of 2-1/2 percentage points higher than the
product-side figures. Under this scenario, an income-side-based measure of
1. This output figure is consistent with the BEA's advance estimate of growth in real GDP.

nonfarm productivity would have increased roughly 3-1/2 percent between the
second quarter of 1998 and the second quarter of 1999, about 12 percentage
point faster than the product-side measure. That said, whether this alternative
measure is closer to "truth" is conjectural, and both the product- and income-
side measures of output could be revised appreciably in this fall's
comprehensive benchmark revisions to the NIPA.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose just 0.1 percent in June and then jumped 0.7 percent
in July. The outsized gain in July reflected in part a surge in the output of
utilities as the heat wave in the eastern United States spurred electricity demand.
However, manufacturing production also moved unevenly, edging up only
0.1 percent in June before surging 0.6 percent last month. To some extent, the
monthly variations probably were exaggerated by the interaction in a few
industries of capacity constraints and seasonal factors. The average growth pace
for the two months better captures our sense of what has been occurring in the
factory sector. The factory operating rate averaged 79.5 percent in June and
July, a couple of percentage points below its long-term mean.
Within manufacturing, the output of motor vehicles and parts rose 2 percent in
June but then retraced that advance in July. Although it was scheduled to
remain at a high level last month, production at Ford was held back by parts
shortages that stemmed from startup problems following seasonal plant
shutdowns. Assembly schedules indicate that production likely will rise in
coming months as automakers attempt to build stocks in the face of torrid
demand. Production of high-technology items--computers, semiconductors, and
communications equipment--continued to advance at a strong pace. Output of
business equipment excluding motor vehicles and high-technology items
declined, on balance, over the past two months, with notable weakness in farm
and construction machinery. The output of iron and steel, which bottomed out
late last year, has continued to recover. The production of construction supplies,
which surged in the later part of 1998, has fluctuated around an elevated level
since early this year. Recently, the seasonally adjusted data for the production
of construction supplies have bounced around some, as high rates of capacity
utilization muted the normal pattern of a large pickup in activity in June and a
step down in July.
Production in a number of nondurable goods industries--notably textiles and
chemicals--has picked up, on balance, over the past few months. The gains
come on the heels of large declines in 1998 and essentially flat production
earlier this year. In large part, this pattern mirrors developments in foreign
demand; exports slowed or dropped significantly in these industries in early- to

mid-1998, but began to stabilize this year. Still, though production in these
industries picked up recently, it remains near year-earlier levels.
Recent readings on orders for manufactures suggest that moderate advances in
production will continue. The Beige Book reports improvement in
manufacturing activity in most Districts and suggests that foreign demand for
goods, while below year-earlier levels, has stabilized or improved slightly in
recent months. The new orders index from the National Association of
Purchasing Management also continues to indicate rising orders. However, the
staffs series on real adjusted durable goods orders declined in May and June,
although it increased 1.2 percent for the second quarter as a whole.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles in July (adjusted for shifts in manufacturers' reporting
periods), at 16.7 million units (annual rate), matched the robust pace of the
second quarter. Industry analysts expect that sales will remain exceptionally
strong, with forecasts ranging between 16-3/4 and 17 million units for the
third quarter as a whole.
To this point, demand indicators remain decidedly positive. According to
readings on perceived car-buying conditions in the Michigan SRC survey,
consumers continue to view the market for new vehicles as exceptionally
attractive because economic conditions are good and interest rates are
relatively low. Furthermore, prices have remained subdued, and the CPI for
new vehicles in July was 0.5 percent below its level of a year ago; prices have
been restrained by sales incentives, which increased in the third quarter.
Business demand for light vehicles has also been impressive this year, with
fleet sales through July running about 6 percent above the pace in 1998. Sales
of medium and heavy duty trucks averaged an annual rate of about 615,000
units in June and July, only slightly below the 630,000 unit average of the first
five months of the year. Net new orders for medium and heavy trucks
averaged 480,000 units in June and July, up noticeably from the first five
months of the year.
At the end of July, motor vehicle inventories were on the lean side, owing
partly to the production problems at Ford. Production schedules for the
remainder of the third quarter average about 13.3 million units.
One source of uncertainty in the outlook for the auto market is the status of
ongoing negotiations between the UAW, CAW, and the Big Three
automakers. Industry analysts generally agree that neither workers nor
management will risk derailing the current boom by failing to reach an

agreement before the contracts expire in mid- to late September. Even so,
given the contentious relationship between the unions and the major producers,
particularly GM, a major strike cannot be ruled out. In spite of recent back-
pedaling by GM, tensions concerning GM's proposed modular assembly
techniques and their implications for outsourcing remain high. Furthermore,
Ford's relationship with the UAW has worsened recently, and the union
announced that it intends to fight plans by Ford to spin off its Visteon parts
subsidiary; however, press reports suggest that the likelihood of a strike over
this issue is low.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Real consumer spending rose at an annual rate of about 3-3/4 percent in the
second quarter--a solid gain, but well off the very strong pace of the first
quarter--and the available data suggest there may be some further slippage in
the current period.2 The fundamental factors supporting spending are still
favorable, however: Growth in real disposable income has been solid,
households' wealth has increased substantially again so far this year, and
consumer sentiment remains exceptionally positive.
According to the advance report, nominal outlays at stores in the retail control
category increased 0.2 percent in July. General merchandise stores and outlets
selling "other durable goods" posted strong gains. But these were partly offset
by a drop in nominal purchases at apparel stores and at eating and drinking
establishments. After factoring in the increase in consumer prices last month,
we estimate that real outlays for goods other than motor vehicles edged down
0.1 percent in July. However, real consumer spending on motor vehicles
likely rose last month, and we estimate that real personal consumption
expenditures for all goods ticked up in July to a level 0.7 percent above the
second-quarter average.3
Real outlays for services increased at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent in the
second quarter, with spending in all the major components posting solid gains.
In the current quarter, extremely hot weather in July boosted outlays for
energy services. Real outlays for brokerage services also may have been up a
good deal in July as stock market trading volume rose last month for the first
time since last April. However, so far in August, temperatures and stock
market volume have averaged closer to seasonal norms.
2. This second-quarter figure is about 1/4 percentage point below the BEA's advance
estimate, owing to revised retail sales data.
3. Overall unit sales of light vehicles declined in July, but this reflected a drop in fleet sales
to businesses rather than a decline in purchases by individuals. The data allocating sales
between fleet and retail customers are confidential.

At the end of July, the Census Bureau released revised estimates of retail sales
back to 1990.4 The revisions reflected information from the 1997 Census of
Retail Trade. (These censuses are conducted every five years.) The BEA will
incorporate the revisions into its estimates of the increase in the second-quarter
PCE with this month's preliminary GDP release. However, revisions to
earlier PCE data will not be published until the comprehensive benchmark
revisions to the NIPA in late October. Overall, the revised data suggest
scarcely any change in growth rates of real PCE in 1998 or the first half of
1999. However, revisions to earlier periods were more substantial, pointing
to an upward adjustment to the growth in total real PCE of nearly
0.2 percentage point per year from 1993 through 1997. The cumulative effect
of these revisions, other things equal, will be to raise the level of real PCE in
1998 $46 billion, or 2-1/4 percent, from the previous estimate.

Of course, after the BEA incorporates additional information from other

addition, when considering the implications for the personal saving rate,
revisions to personal income could also be a factor. On that score, state
4. Not seasonally adjusted data were revised from January 1993 through June 1999;
seasonal factors and seasonally adjusted data were revised back to January 1990. For its
upcoming benchmark revision to the NIPA, the BEA will revise seasonal factors from 1988
onward.

unemployment insurance data suggest a substantial upward revision--on the
order of $40 billion--to the level of wage and salary income in 1998.5
With regard to more recent income data, real disposable personal income rose
3-3/4 percent over the twelve months ended in June--up from the 3 percent
increase recorded over the same period a year ago. Part of the strengthening
in income growth over the past year reflected payments to farmers under a bill
signed last autumn. But, even if these special payments are excluded from
personal income, real DPI still rose 3-1/4 percent over the past year. In July,
wage and salary income appears poised to post a substantial gain, based on the
readings on production-worker hours and average hourly earnings.
Consumer confidence has edged lower in recent months but has changed
relatively little on balance so far this year. The Michigan SRC index of
consumer sentiment was pulled down in early August by somewhat less
favorable appraisals of buying conditions for large household goods and
opinions concerning business conditions over the next year. However, views on
current and expected personal financial situations improved, as did expectations
of longer-term business conditions over the next five years. The Conference
Board index of consumer sentiment declined in July, but it too remained at a
high level.
Housing Markets
Activity in the housing sector has remained strong so far this summer. Starts
of single-family houses were at a 1.33 million unit annual rate in July, up
from June's 1.27 million unit rate and only a little short of the average pace
during the first half of this year. The seasonal peak of single-family starts
normally is in June. However, owing to large backlogs--that reflect, in part,
production constraints related to shortages of labor and some key materials--
builders did not pare construction as much as they usually do in July. Indeed,
on a not seasonally adjusted basis, single-family starts declined 4 percent in
July as compared with the typical 9 percent decline built into the seasonal
factors. Multifamily starts were at a 333,000 unit pace in July, similar to their
average during the first half of this year.
5. Other notable revisions to the household sector that will occur in October include the
following: a boost to real (but not nominal) PCE due to the incorporation of the geometric
means CPI data the following for 1978-1994; and moving the pension plan contributions of
local, state, and federal governments out of the government sector and into the household sector,
which will raise personal income. (We estimate that, by itself, this latter change will boost the
current level of the saving rate approximately 1-3/4 percentage points, but that it will not
substantially alter the downward trend in the saving rate over the past few years.)

Home sales continued at elevated levels through June. Sales of new homes
rose to an annual rate of 929,000 in that month, 2-1/4 percent above the
average earlier this year. Existing home sales were at a 5.53 million unit rate
in June, nearly 7 percent higher than their average from January to May.
(New home sales are the more current indicator of demand, for they generally
are reported at the time a contract is signed rather than at the closing, as is
more common for existing home sales.)
Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages have increased more than a percentage
point this year, but the effect of that rise on housing demand has been blunted
to some extent by shifting into adjustable-rate loans. The rate on one-year
adjustable rate mortgages has risen only half as much as the fixed mortgage
rate. As a result, the ARM share of purchase loans, which bottomed out at
8 percent last fall when the yield curve was relatively flat, has been trending
up and stood at 22 percent in June.6
Applications for mortgages to purchase homes have receded somewhat, on net,
since June, but nevertheless are at a high level. In addition, builders' ratings
of new home sales, which soared in June to the highest level on record, eased
a bit in July and August, but remained comfortably above the levels of last
summer. However, recent data from the Michigan SRC survey indicated that
the backup in mortgage rates has contributed substantially to a notable retreat
in consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions.
Demand and cost pressures appear to have translated into an acceleration in
new home prices this year. The average price of new homes in the second
quarter was up 6.4 percent from a year earlier. The constant-quality price
index for new homes--which controls for a number of attributes and is thus a
better measure of house price inflation--rose at an annual rate of about
4-3/4 percent in the first half of this year, compared with a 3 percent pace in
both 1997 and 1998. The year-over-year change in prices of existing homes
averaged about 5-1/2 percent during the first half of this year, similar to the
1998 pace. These contrasting figures for house price inflation possibly reflect
in part the different regional composition of new and existing home sales.
Moreover, some of the acceleration in new house prices may be attributable to
6. Adjustable-rate loans include not only one-year ARMs, but also loans that switch to a
fixed rate after a set period of time.

an increase in certain amenities that are not captured by the quality adjustment
procedure.
Although the most recent data suggest an easing of some cost pressures, on
balance, the prices of lumber, plywood, and gypsum products have risen
substantially over the past year. The producer price index for components and
materials for construction--which measures the cost of inputs for all types of
construction (not just residential)--rose 2-1/4 percent over the twelve months
ended in July; this index was essentially unchanged in the year-earlier period.
The increase in the PPI for construction materials has been held back by lower
prices for asphalt roofing materials and some metals used in construction.8
With regard to labor costs, the average hourly earnings of construction
workers in July were up 3-1/2 percent from a year earlier. The year-over-year
increase in this series had trended down in 1997 and 1998 but has accelerated
about 1 percentage point since the turn of this year. The employment cost
index for workers in the construction industry--which includes both wages and
benefits but holds constant the mix of jobs and overtime--was up 3.1 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
Producers' durable equipment. Real outlays on producers' durable
equipment increased at an annual rate of 15 percent in the second quarter, with
growth again fueled by strong demand for high-tech equipment and motor
vehicles. The little information that is available concerning spending in the
current quarter points toward a moderate deceleration.
Real expenditures on office and computing equipment posted increases of
about 40 percent (annual rate) in each of the first two quarters of this year.
Though well below the 64 percent advance recorded in 1998, the recent pace
of spending is still large enough to result in a rapid expansion of the stock of
computing equipment. Concerning the recent data, nominal shipments of
office and computing equipment rose 3.3 percent for the second quarter as a
whole, but they backed down noticeably in May and June from the high
reached in April. Even taking into account the anecdotal evidence that the
pace of Y2K-related upgrades has slowed and that some businesses are
planning to postpone further system upgrades until after the turn of the year,
7. The attributes controlled for by the constant-quality price index include the size of
homes, the number of bathrooms, the type of parking facility, the type of foundation, and the
number of bedrooms. The index does not, however, control for the use of higher-quality
building materials and components or for the addition of numerous luxury features.
8. Metal components are primarily used in nonresidential construction, although some
residential builders have begun using metal structural components.

underlying demand for computers seems strong and this recent weakness in
shipments likely is transitory. Elsewhere in the high-tech sector, real outlays
on communications equipment have soared this year, rising at an annual rate
of nearly 50 percent in the second quarter. With nominal orders up 3 percent
last quarter, the near-term outlook for spending remains very positive.
Spending on transportation equipment appears set to be a drag on PDE
growth in the current quarter. After having posted hefty increases over the
first half of this year, indications are that business spending on motor vehicles
may be falling off. Outlays by domestic carriers for commercial aircraft are
not likely to post much of a gain this quarter. Imports from Airbus should be
up some; Boeing's delivery schedules suggest that its total shipments should
be about flat this quarter, though information on the destination of these
shipments, and thus on the split between domestic outlays and exports, is still
sketchy.
Expenditures on equipment outside the high-tech and transportation
categories have been flat over the past few quarters. Real investment on
industrial equipment declined 1/2 percent over the four quarters ended in the
second quarter of 1999; spending on this category has probably been held back
by weak demand from the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about
65 percent of outlays for industrial equipment.9 Other weak categories over
the past year have been agricultural machinery (down 14 percent) and
construction machinery (down 9 percent). The near-term indicators for
outlays outside the high-tech and transportation categories are mixed. Orders
were very weak in the second quarter, falling 2-1/2 percent. Although much
of the decline reflected a falloff in orders for engines and turbines--where lead
times are long and orders previously had been extremely strong--bookings for
other items also were fairly soft. On the plus side, manufacturing activity has
been firmer of late, suggesting that weakness in this sector is likely to be less
of a restraint in the coming months than it has been over the past several
quarters.
Nonresidential Structures. After having posted solid gains late last year and
early this year, real outlays for nonresidential structures edged down in the
second quarter, in part because of continued weakness in industrial buildings
and declines in outlays for institutional structures and hotels and motels. In
addition, real outlays for office buildings, which rose at an annual rate of
22 percent in the first quarter, flattened out in the second quarter.
9. About half of the remainder of industrial equipment is purchased by the utility and
mining sectors and about half by a variety of other industries.

Contracts for new private construction fell sharply in July, following a large
decline in the second quarter. In the office sector, contracts bounced back up
last month but were still well off the recent peaks. Elsewhere, contracts for
industrial structures continued to plunge. Contracts for other commercial
buildings dipped in July.
Business Inventories
Real nonfarm inventory investment slowed in the second quarter, and, by
historical standards, stocks appear lean in many industries. We estimate that
real total nonfarm inventories increased at an annual rate of $11-1/2 billion
last quarter, down from a $35 billion pace in the first quarter of the year.10
The motor vehicle sector accounted for about $5 billion of the decline in the
pace of inventory investment. Outside of motor vehicles, the step-down in
stockbuilding in real terms contrasts with a pickup in book value inventory
investment last quarter. The rise in petroleum prices largely accounted for
this difference: Although refiners and petroleum wholesalers drew down
stocks in real terms last quarter, the rising prices of crude oil and refined
products increased the value of the inventories held on their books.
Despite the rise in petroleum prices, the book value of manufacturing
inventories for the sector as a whole declined in the second quarter for the
third quarter in a row. The drop reflects shrinking stocks of aircraft and parts
that have accompanied the slower production at Boeing. However, even
excluding the aircraft and petroleum industries, stockbuilding by
manufacturers has been modest and inventory-shipments ratios have declined
across a wide range of industries. Most notably, inventory-shipments ratios in
the metals and chemicals industries, which had been relatively high last year,
have dropped significantly in recent quarters.
The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an
annual rate of $5 billion in the second quarter, about the same modest pace as
recorded in the previous two quarters. Sales in the wholesale sector have been
robust, on balance, in recent months. These developments brought the
inventory-sales ratio for nonvehicle wholesalers, which had reached a 12-year
high of 1.34 months in August 1998, down to 1.26 months in June, about in
line with the average level for this ratio over the past few years. Only a few
signs of inventory imbalances remain in the wholesale sector--namely, at
distributors of machinery, where stocks remain stubbornly high, and at jobbers
10. This figure is about $4 billion below the advance GDP estimate; on balance, the book
value inventory data that have become available since the advance release have been weaker
than the BEA had assumed.

of metals and minerals, although their inventory-sales ratios have backed off
some from recent peaks.
In the retail trade sector, the book value of non-auto stocks rose at an annual
rate of $9.6 billion in the second quarter, down from a $16.6 billion pace in
the first quarter. Inventories for this category have moved in line with sales in
recent months. The inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers was 1.35
months in June, a very lean level by historical comparison. However, this
ratio has remained in a relatively narrow range since February, suggesting that
retailers might be fairly comfortable with the current level of stocks.
Federal Government
The federal budget surplus over the twelve months ending in June was
$97 billion, up $40 billion from the corresponding year-earlier period. After
adjustment for payment timing shifts, deposit insurance, spectrum auction
proceeds, and sales of major assets, the improvement was about $45 billion.
The continued favorable surplus trends were reflected in recent mid-session
budget reviews by the OMB and the CBO. The OMB now projects unified
budget surpluses of $99 billion for fiscal 1999 and $142 billion for fiscal 2000."
The OMB projects that the surplus will increase steadily thereafter, rising to
$254 billion by 2004 and to $473 billion by 2009. The CBO's new baseline
projection is somewhat more positive than the OMB's in the near term; it shows
surpluses under current laws and policies of $120 billion in fiscal 1999 and
$161 billion in fiscal 2000. The CBO's surplus projection remains slightly
higher than the OMB's through fiscal 2004 and then falls below it, ending in
fiscal 2009 at $413 billion.2
The OMB's surplus projections for fiscal 1999 and 2000 are up $20 billion and
$25 billion, respectively, from its forecasts made in February. The CBO's
projections were revised up $9 billion in 1999 and $28 billion in 2000. These
revisions largely were the result of more positive economic assumptions--unlike
the past few years, neither agency was greatly surprised by this year's tax
11. The OMB projections reported here include some minor policy changes but exclude the
effects of Administration social security and Medicare reform proposals, and the adoption of
initiatives (notably, Universal Savings Accounts and some additional discretionary spending)
that were proposed contingent on the enactment of those reforms.
12. The OMB's on-budget projections--that is, excluding Social Security and the Postal
Service--are for a deficit of $25 billion in fiscal 1999 and a surplus of $5 billion in fiscal 2000.
The on-budget surplus is projected to rise to $79 billion in 2004 and $240 billion in fiscal 2009.
CBO's on-budget projections are for a deficit of $4 billion in fiscal 1999, and surpluses of
$14 billion in fiscal 2000, $85 billion in 2004, and $178 billion in 2009.

collections. Both agencies also revised up their surplus projections over the
longer run, reflecting more favorable assumptions for economic growth and
unemployment.
With regard to budget legislation for fiscal 2000, the House has passed 11 and
the Senate has passed 9 of the 13 regular appropriations bills that fund
discretionary spending. Emergency and regular spending included in these bills
exceeds allocations that were designed to meet the fiscal 2000 discretionary
spending caps by about $30 billion. (The caps mandated substantial cuts in real
spending, while the appropriation bills hold real spending at about the 1999
level.) In addition, the Congress has passed a tax cut bill that would reduce
fiscal 2000 revenues $5 billion. Although the President has promised to veto
this tax cut, he also has proposed spending that is not included in the current
versions of the appropriation bills and indicated a willingness to accept a small
future tax cut. This leaves open the possibility of a compromise between the
Congress and the Administration that would involve both tax cuts and additional
spending. These circumstances create substantial risk that the currently
projected on-budget surpluses for fiscal 2000 will not materialize.
State and Local Government
Real purchases of goods and services by state and local governments edged
down in the second quarter, as increases in expenditures for consumption and
equipment were outweighed by a retracing of the surge in real construction
spending in the first quarter.13 Most of this gyration in construction results from
an atypical pattern for highway construction, which rose sharply on a seasonally
adjusted basis early in the year when relatively warm weather muted the usual
winter slowdown in activity. In recent months, adjusted highway spending has
moved back down, and by June it was at the low end of the range seen in recent
years.
The fiscal condition of state governments has continued to improve.
According to a preliminary survey, fiscal 1999 marked the sixth consecutive
year of improving budgetary conditions.14 Indeed, as a percent of general
fund expenditures, year-end general fund balances stood at their highest level
since 1978, when the data were first collected. During the past year, as in
other recent years, strong revenue growth has allowed many states to make
13. New information on construction spending in June and revisions to data for earlier
months suggest that the BEA's advance estimate of a 0.2 percent annual rate decline in real state
and local government purchases in the second quarter will be revised to show a decline of about
1 percent.
14. Forty-four states reported in the National Conference of State Legislature's survey; final
and complete figures will probably not be available until December.

deposits into their rainy-day funds and/or to cut taxes. Many states have also
been able to expand construction projects and expenditures for operational
programs. Among general fund spending, the largest increases in
appropriation for fiscal 2000 are for education.
Prices and Wages
Prices. Inflation remained subdued through the middle of the summer. The
overall CPI, which was flat in May and June, increased 0.3 percent in July.
Excluding food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 0.2 percent in July,
after rising 0.1 percent in June. On a twelve-month change basis, core
consumer prices were up 2.1 percent as of July 1999, essentially unchanged
from the 2.2 percent increase in the previous twelve-month period.15
Reflecting the rebound in energy prices, the rate of increase of the overall CPI
stepped up from 1.7 percent over the twelve months ended July 1998 to
2.1 percent in the most recent twelve-month period.
Consumer food prices increased 0.2 percent in July following no change in
June. Over the past twelve months, food prices rose 2.1 percent--little
changed from the previous twelve months and the same rate as core inflation.
The CPI for energy rose 2.1 percent in July, following declines of
1-1/4 percent in both May and June. Gasoline prices turned up sharply again
in July; prices had moved down in May and June after having soared
15 percent in April. Recent survey data suggest that gasoline prices continued
to rise rapidly through early August.
Outside of food and energy, the prices of consumer commodities edged up
0.1 percent in July and were just 0.6 percent higher than a year earlier. New
vehicle prices were little changed last month, but used car prices continued to
rebound. The volatile apparel price index dropped sharply in July and is down
1-3/4 percent over the past year. But tobacco prices jumped 3.3 percent in
July, continuing the zig-zag pattern that has prevailed since early this year.
Prices of non-energy services rose 0.3 percent in July, following an increase
of 0.1 percent in June. Owners' equivalent rent rose 0.1 percent in July for
the second consecutive month. So far this year, owners' equivalent rent has
increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, well below the pace in recent
15. The staffs consistent methodology series for core CPI showed no deceleration,
increasing 2.0 percent over both twelve-month periods.

years.16 Elsewhere, prices of medical care services rose 0.2 percent in July on
top of a 0.4 percent increase in June. At 3.3 percent, the year-over-year
change in these prices continued to run ahead of general price inflation. And
the turbulence in airfares continued, as July's 6.5 percent jump followed
June's decline of nearly 5 percent.
Other broad measures of inflation have moved up recently, partly reflecting
the pickup in energy prices. The GDP chain price index rose 1.3 percent from
the second quarter of 1998 to the second quarter of 1999, a bit ahead of the
1.0 percent increase in the previous four-quarter period. The chain price
indexes for gross domestic purchases and for personal consumption
expenditures both accelerated more than GDP prices, owing largely to their
greater energy shares; excluding food and energy, both indexes accelerated
about 1/4 percentage point over the past four quarters.
In the PPI, capital goods prices edged lower in July, following a 0.3 percent
decline in June. Prices of light vehicles moved down again in July, after
having posted sizable declines in June. On the other hand, computer prices
have dropped at an average rate of about 1-1/4 percent in the past two months,
considerably slower than their earlier rate of decline. Over the twelve months
ending in July, capital goods prices are down 0.1 percent, compared with a
0.5 percent decrease in the previous twelve-month period.
At earlier stages of processing, some notable firming has occurred in the
prices for materials excluding food and energy. Some of these prices have
been boosted by the passthrough of higher crude oil costs. More generally,
the pickup in materials prices probably reflects a turnaround in demand--
especially from Asia--and heightened prospects for further increases in
worldwide growth.
Specifically, the PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy
rose 0.4 percent in July; this sizable gain followed June's 0.5 percentage point
increase, and the recent run-up is the largest since the 1994-95 burst, which
occurred at a time of much higher U.S. capacity utilization and poorer vendor
performance. Prices of materials used in construction increased 3/4 percent in
each of the past two months, and prices of some metal and plastic products
moved higher in July. Analysis by the Board staff suggests that increases in
core intermediate prices are passed through to the core CPI relatively quickly,
within about one to two quarters. Nonetheless, the magnitude to date of the
16. Although the procedures for housing in the CPI changed in January, the BLS maintains
that this change has not affected the magnitude of increases in owners' equivalent rent this year.

pickup in the PPI for core materials implies only a small boost to core
consumer prices.17
Looking farther back in the production process, the core crude PPI was up
2-1/4 percent in July, following a rise of 0.5 percent in June. The Journal of
Commerce index of commodity prices rose 2.5 percent between mid-June and
mid-July, but has since changed little, on net.
Although the monthly numbers are erratic, the preliminary read on short-term
inflation expectations from the Michigan SRC survey rose in early August.
Median expectations of inflation over the next year came in at 2.9 percent in
August, up from the second quarter average; the mean one-year inflation
expectation moved up to 3.3 percent. However, consumers evidently view the
bulge as transitory: Median expectations of inflation over the next five to ten
years from the Michigan survey inched down to 2.7 percent, from 2.8 percent
in the second quarter.
Labor Costs. We have seen a series of higher readings for increases in wages
and salaries and total compensation per hour in the recent quarterly and
monthly statistical releases. Even with these gains, however, the
compensation data still show some deceleration over the past year.
The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry
workers jumped at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the three months ended in
June after having risen at an unusually slow 1.4 percent rate in the first
quarter. Still, on a twelve-month basis, hourly compensation in the ECI
decelerated slightly, from 3.5 percent during the twelve months ended in June
1998 to 3.3 percent during the twelve months ended in June 1999.
The ECI for private wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 5.0 percent in
the second quarter following a 1.8 percent rate increase in the previous
quarter. The second-quarter bounceback reflected a surge in finance,
insurance, and real estate as well as a pickup in some other industries
following unusually weak first-quarter numbers. Nevertheless, on a twelve-
month-change basis, hourly wages and salaries decelerated from a 4.0 percent
17. Our research also suggests that the impact of core intermediate materials prices on the
core CPI tends to be larger during periods of high resource utilization, proxied by either the
unemployment rate or capacity utilization. (This may be because competitive pressures are
greater when the economy is weak, making it harder for firms to pass along cost increases.) Of
course, these indicators currently are giving conflicting readings of slack, but even based on the
unemployment rate, the influence of the recent runup in core intermediate materials prices on
the CPI ought to be small.

increase in June 1998 to a 3.6 percent gain in June 1999. The deceleration
was most prominent in the FIRE category.
Benefit costs in the ECI increased at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the
second quarter, following a rise of 0.8 percent in the first quarter. Much of
this volatility was a result of swings in non-production bonuses. Overall,
benefit costs were up 2.5 percent during the twelve-months ended in June,
little changed from the 2.6 percent rate of increase in the previous twelve-
month period. Health insurance costs and legally required benefits accelerated
over this period, but these pickups were offset by smaller increases in
supplemental pay and in retirement and savings benefits. (Please note: With
the exception of the health insurance numbers, these data on benefit
components are confidential and not for release to the public.)
According to the BLS's productivity and cost measure, hourly compensation in
the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the
second quarter, up from a 4.4 percent rise in the first quarter. Over the past
four quarters, hourly compensation increased 4.3 percent, the same as the
increase over the previous four-quarter period. However, this fall we are
anticipating a considerable upward revision to the rate of increase in
compensation per hour during 1998--one that could, all else equal, boost the
four-quarter changes through the second quarters of 1998 and 1999 to about
5.0 percent and 4-3/4 percent respectively.18
The recent monthly readings for average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers have been on the high side; earnings were up
0.5 percent in July following a 0.4 percent increase in June. Nonetheless, like
the other measures of hourly compensation, this reading of wages has
decelerated over the past year: On a twelve-month change basis, average
hourly earnings were up 3.8 percent in the period ended in July, down from a
4.3 rate of rise in the previous twelve months. Much of this deceleration
occurred in the second half of last year, and in part reflected the warning
boost from the earlier minimum wage hike.
18. The BLS constructs its measure of hourly compensation using information on total
compensation in the nonfarm business sector published by the BEA in the NIPA and data on
hours from its own household and payroll employment surveys. The BEA's analysis of the
unemployment insurance tax records for 1998 point to a large upward revision to wages and
salaries in that year. (The revision to compensation per hour will likely be most pronounced in
the first half of the year.) These--and a host of other data that could affect compensation per
hour--will be incorporated in the NIPA in this October's comprehensive benchmark revisions
and in the productivity and cost data that are released in November.

On an industry basis, manufacturing wages have posted sharp gains recently, a
somewhat surprising development in light of the weakness observed in this
sector more generally. Since January, average hourly earnings in
manufacturing have risen 6 percent at an annual rate. Some of the rapid
increase in wages reflects the growing use of overtime hours; excluding
overtime, straight-time wages increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent over
the past six months. By contrast, the ECI paints a relatively benign picture for
the sector, with its measure of wages and salaries of manufacturing workers
increasing at annual rates of 3-1/4 percent in both the first and second
quarters. (Unlike average hourly earnings, the ECI is not affected by changes
in overtime hours or by occupational or industry mix shifts within
manufacturing.)19 Outside of manufacturing, average hourly earnings for
construction and transportation workers also have picked up.
Agricultural Developments
Dry weather has been hurting crops in some parts of the country in recent weeks,
but the damage overall does not appear to have been great enough to
significantly alter the farm outlook. The USDA's latest production forecasts for
the major farm crops, based on conditions as of August 1, showed only small
downward revisions from last month's estimates and were slightly stronger, on
balance, than the estimates available at the time the June Greenbook was
completed. Crop prices, which had moved up sharply from mid-July to early
August in response to concerns about the weather, fell back sharply after the
August crop report was released.
Whether the current production estimates will hold up through coming revisions
remains to be seen. The USDA's weekly reports on crop conditions suggest, for
example, that weather may have taken a further toll on the crops in the first half
of August. Still, the crops are rapidly approaching a point of maturity such that
a catastrophic outcome--for the nation as a whole--seems quite unlikely. Even
allowing for further markdowns from the August estimates, supplies are
likely to remain ample, if not excessive.
Meanwhile, livestock output continues to advance. The USDA is predicting
increases of about 1-1/2 percent for both beef and pork this year; 1999
production forecasts for both those crops have been revised up over the past
couple of months. Output of poultry, which had posted a subpar gain of only
1 percent in 1998, appears to be headed for a more typical increase--about
19. In addition,.the ECI sample includes supervisory workers, who are excluded from the
calculation of average hourly earnings.

II-52
5 percent--in 1999. Production of milk is expected to rise 3 percent this year, a
relatively large advance by historical standards.
Futures prices of agricultural products displayed considerable volatility over the
period from late June to mid-August, initially plunging in response to
indications of favorable crop progress, then turning up sharply as concerns about
the drought intensified, only to fall back again, as noted above, in reaction to the
USDA's August crop report. On net, the index of futures prices that the staff
maintains firmed somewhat between late June and mid-August. Crop prices
ended up little changed over the period, but dairy prices staged another big run-
up, similar to the price surge that developed in 1998. Market sources indicate
that strength of demand for dairy products is more than offsetting the impressive
gain in milk production this year. Futures prices, overall, continue to point to
only a moderate rebound in farm prices over the coming year.
In the absence of a significant price rally, government subsidies to agriculture
seem likely to remain substantial. The Freedom to Farm bill provided fixed
annual payments of about $5 billion to farmers over the seven-year period
starting in 1996. A safety net feature of that bill provided for added payments
during times of unusually low prices, and the USDA is predicting that those
payments will exceed $2-1/2 billion in fiscal 1999. Still more subsidies (about
$5 billion) were appropriated for fiscal 1999 to offset the effects of soft export
markets and crop and livestock losses that occurred in some regions last year.
This year again, a sizable emergency allocation to agriculture is working its way
through Congress. The Senate approved additional farm aid of $7-1/2 billion
before recessing, and final details of an aid package will be worked out with
House conferees when the Congress reconvenes.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Financial markets have been on edge recently, uncertain about the inflation
outlook and Federal Reserve policy and anxious about possible Y2K-related
problems. Liquidity has been at a premium, likely compounded by still-vivid
memories of last fall's turmoil, and a wide range of price spreads have reflected
the strains.
Treasury yields generally fell early in the intermeeting period, despite the
tightening of monetary policy announced in June. The announcement also
included news that the Committee, though still highly attentive to inflation risks,
had shifted to a neutral bias in its directive. This shift led some market
participants to trim their expectations of additional policy tightening going
forward. Subsequently, however, Treasury yields retraced most of this decline.
First, the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on July 22 was interpreted
by most market participants as suggesting greater odds of a tighter monetary
stance in the near term than they had read from the June announcement. The
markets' assessment of those odds was raised further in light of subsequent data
indicating some emerging pressures on labor costs. Increasing signs of an
incipient recovery in Europe also likely pushed Treasury yields higher by
reducing the relative attractiveness of dollar assets. On net, yields on
intermediate- and long-term Treasury securities are little changed or slightly
down since the last FOMC meeting. Market participants evidently now believe
that a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate at the August meeting is
highly likely; indeed, they appear to be giving nontrivial odds on a further policy
tightening move by year-end.
Anticipating higher rates and possible disruptions to liquidity in credit markets
near the end of the year, corporations and other issuers of fixed-income
securities have accelerated their long-term borrowing. Gross offerings of
investment-grade corporate bonds were heavy in July and the first half of
August, and issuance of agency debt, commercial-mortgage-backed securities,
and asset-backed securities also has been robust. Partly as a result of these
supply pressures, credit spreads have widened--and worries that they might push
out further have led to intensified hedging activity by prospective issuers,
driving spreads on interest rate swaps above their highs of last year.1
1. Swaps have become an increasingly favored hedging instrument since last fall's financial
market turmoil: Many dealers and underwriters who had been relying on short Treasury
positions as a primary hedging tool reportedly suffered sizable losses when credit spreads
widened sharply last year. Swaps are less vulnerable to basis risk occurring when private rates
rise in relation to those on Treasuries.

The latest data on consumer credit show a sharp deceleration in the second
quarter, but mortgage debt continued to rise at a rapid clip. Municipal bond
issuance has remained strong into the third quarter, although it has slowed from
its remarkable June pace. The federal government expects to pay down debt in
the third quarter and has announced several steps to maintain the liquidity of the
market for its securities in the face of its shrinking debt. The Treasury has also
indicated that it was targeting an unexpectedly large cash balance of $80 billion
at year-end as a precaution against Y2K problems, which will boost bill issuance
in the remainder of the year.
Equity prices rose substantially in the first half of the intermeeting period,
buoyed by lower interest rates and earnings reports that were generally better
than anticipated. However, those gains were largely reversed with the backup in
rates since mid-July. Over the intermeeting period, the Wilshire 5000 dropped
about 1 percent, while other major indexes were little changed or up 1 to
3 percent. The prices of Internet stocks have declined on net and are now
18 percent below their April peak, but still up 38 percent so far in 1999.2
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remained moderate in July. Bank
credit was about flat last month; an increase in security holdings roughly offset a
decline in loans. However, early data for August suggest some rebound in bank
credit growth.
Yield Spreads and Financial Market Liquidity
Financial market participants' concerns about shifting credit demands and
market liquidity in advance of the century date change evidently have increased
in recent weeks. Rates on six-month Eurodollar deposits jumped about 20 basis
points as their maturity crossed year-end, and the yield on Treasury bills
maturing early in 2000 fell by a like amount. In addition, the already-substantial
premiums on commercial paper issues that extend into next year increased
further, and the millennium butterfly spread in the Eurodollar futures market
rose about 10 basis points at the end of June, as did the butterfly spread in the
Euribor futures market.3
2. The references to Internet stock prices are based on the Inter@ctive Week Internet Index,
which is a value-weighted index of 50 companies whose business is tied to the Internet,
including Internet retailers, providers of content and services, and producers of computer
hardware and communications equipment.
3. These butterfly spreads are the difference between the rate on the December contract and
the average of the rates on the September and March contracts. Because the rate on the
December contract is for a deposit from mid-December to mid-March, it should capture the
expected effects of the century date change on funding costs.

Concerns about Y2K-related disruptions to market activity apparently were not
limited to the money markets. The desire to secure financing before a possible
reduction in market liquidity as the year-end approaches reportedly has led some
issuers in the fixed-income markets to advance part of their financing into the
current quarter. The anticipated stepped-up issuance in the near term and
perhaps some lingering memories of last fall's difficulties have apparently
contributed to a widening of yield spreads over Treasuries in the corporate debt,
commercial-mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities markets,
but most spread levels remain below their highs of last year. Nonetheless, to
hedge against the risk of further widening of credit spreads, many market
participants that have immediate plans to issue or underwrite securities have
entered interest rate swaps as fixed-rate payers, helping push the ten-year swap
spread to record highs during the intermeeting period.4 Increased uncertainty
about the path of short-term interest rates, as evidenced by a rise in implied
volatility from options on Eurodollar futures contracts, may also have driven
swap spreads wider by increasing the demand for fixed-rate payer positions. In
contrast to the level of swap spreads, Eurodollar implied volatility remains well
below levels reached last year.
Greater hedging activity probably is also behind the intensified specialness in RP
markets of some on-the-run Treasury issues and has thus contributed to a
deterioration of some measures of market performance. The overnight and term
repo rates for the on-the-run ten-year Treasury note are well below other short-
term market rates, and some off-the-run/on-the-run Treasury spreads have
widened of late. Still, although the latest readings on conditions in the Treasury
securities market suggest that most bid-asked spreads are still a bit wider than
the "typical" levels that prevailed prior to last fall, recent movements in these
spreads do not appear to be signaling any significant pressure in overall Treasury
market liquidity.
Business Finance
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations rose to a hefty
$25-1/2 billion in July after having slowed somewhat in June. Flows thus far in
August suggest another strong month. Corporate bond prices rallied following
the monetary policy announcement on June 30, and a number of investment-
grade companies returned to the market in July and during the first two weeks of
August--in some instances with jumbo-sized offerings, taking advantage of
4. The widening of swap spreads can also be attributed to a reduction in perceived
prepayment risks on mortgages as market interest rates have risen. Some holders of mortgages
and mortgage-backed securities, finding that their portfolios now have durations longer than
they desire, reportedly have decided to enter swaps as fixed-rate payers, effectively shortening
durations by converting part of their fixed-rate assets into floating ones and, in the process,
adding to the upward pressures on swap spreads.

investors'preferences for liquid, high-grade bonds. Issuance by speculative-
grade firms in July and early August fell short of June's pace, as some deals were
postponed or canceled because of weak investor interest.
Short- and intermediate-term business credit turned up in July, in part as some
speculative-grade firms tapped bank lines instead of a less receptive bond
market. Results from the August Senior Loan Officer Survey show a modestly
more restrictive posture toward business lending mostly taking the form of wider
credit spreads. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was down
substantially in June, erasing strong growth in April and May, but turned up
briskly in July and early August.
The credit performance of U.S. businesses has remained fairly strong, but some
indicators have deteriorated a bit. The delinquency rate on C&I loans at banks
continued to edge up in the second quarter. The ratio of failed-business
liabilities to total liabilities for all nonfinancial businesses picked up through
June and July, though it remained low by historical standards. In addition, the
junk bond default rate jumped in July, and the twelve-month trailing-average
rate is the highest level since 1992. In contrast, Moody's rating changes have
resulted in modest net upgrades, mainly reflecting merger-related synergies, and
the list of nonfinancial firms on the Watchlist suggests further small net
improvements.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations totaled a hefty $10 billion in
July, reflecting some bounceback from early June when firms postponed their
offerings as prices stagnated. Thus far in August, gross equity issuance has
roughly matched the; July pace. Seasoned offerings have been particularly
strong, bolstered by the large financing needs of telecommunications companies.
IPOs continued at a frenetic pace, and despite the pounding taken by Internet
stocks over the past two months, "dot-com" issues continued to account for more
than half of IPO volume. Average first-day returns were still well above
50 percent in July, but that was off sharply from 100 percent and more earlier
this year. Moreover, in late July and early August, a few well-publicized IPOs
encountered quite poor first-day returns, suggesting that investor enthusiasm
may have finally started to flag. Even so, the list of registered offerings is long,
and new filings have continued at a rapid clip.
M&A activity continues to sizzle. In the second quarter, equity retirements
associated with cash-financed mergers totaled about $24 billion, in line with the
brisk first-quarter pace. In addition, U.S. equity retirements were boosted by a
number of large acquisitions by foreigners. New deals continue to be announced
at a record pace. As a result, the pending list is bulging with deals slated to close
later this year or next year, indicating that cash needs will remain high in the

near term. In contrast, announcements of share repurchases slowed for the
second consecutive quarter, suggesting a moderate step-down from the
extraordinary pace of last year.
S&P 500 earnings per share in the second quarter are estimated to have risen a
robust 10 percent from four quarters earlier. Earnings of nonfinancial firms
accelerated from the already strong gain of the first quarter. The computer-
technology sector logged about a 40 percent gain, accounting for a
disproportionate amount of nonfinancial sector growth, but the earnings of other
nonfinancial industries also rose. Part of the pickup owes to a lessening of the
drag on overall book profits associated with soft commodity prices; also, more
than 1 percentage point of the pickup can be attributed to GM's large profit
increase from strike-depressed levels of a year earlier. Smaller firms continued
to underperform their larger counterparts in the second quarter.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Reports suggest that commercial mortgage rates have increased around 50 basis
points over the past two months and are at levels not seen since early 1997.
Institutions that supply loans for commercial-mortgage-backed securities have
indicated that the back-up in rates has slowed commercial mortgage lending
considerably.
Spreads on investment-grade CMBS have increased 30 to 50 basis points since
the June FOMC. The widening reflects the liquidity and rate uncertainty
concerns noted above. Gross issuance of CMBS is expected to total close to
$16 billion in the third quarter, up from $11 billion in the second quarter.
After a brief rally early in the second quarter, REIT equity values are down
10 percent from their early May peaks and are down 5 percent since the start of
the year. REIT equity and debt issuance has remained weak, and the few issues
brought to market have been poorly received. Property acquisitions have
remained well below the pace of the first half of 1998.
Household Finance
With broad measures of equity prices little changed on net since the June FOMC
meeting, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income has remained not
far from the record reached at midyear. Participating in the post-FOMC meeting
enthusiasm for shares, households allocated $15 billion to domestic equity
mutual funds in July.5 In contrast to recent strength in equity funds, inflows to
bond funds in July recorded only small inflows. However, the weakness in
5. Investors with 401(k) accounts allocated more than two-thirds of new contributions to
company stock and equity funds in the second quarter--a healthy rise from the first quarter.

equity prices and rise in bond yields in late July and early August has apparently
dampened enthusiasm for shares, and equity funds have experienced net
outflows.
Consumer credit decelerated sharply in the second quarter, to an estimated
4-1/2 percent annual pace, but mortgage debt continued to grow at a robust rate.
Bank loan officers reported little change in consumer lending practices over the
past three months. Turning to the current quarter, the rise in mortgage rates
evidently has cut a bit from the volume of applications for home purchase loans,
while refinancings have virtually dried up. Mortgage bankers have started to
trim their work forces, but industry sources express some concern that desperate
efforts to maintain volume will lead to excessively aggressive pricing.
Measures of household credit quality remain strong. Per capita personal
bankruptcy filings fell at an 18 percent annual rate in the second quarter,
reaching their lowest level in nearly three years. Call Report data indicate that
delinquencies on closed-end consumer loans and on credit cards at commercial
banks fell in the second quarter, while delinquencies on mortgage debt were
about unchanged. The Moody's index of delinquency rates on credit card
receivables reached a three-year low in June, while delinquencies at the captive
auto finance companies dropped to a five-year low.
As in other fixed-income markets, a combination of anticipated heavy issuance
and uncertainty about future interest rates drove up spreads on asset-backed
securities. Credit card and home equity loan ABS spreads have reached levels
only slightly below those reached during the market turmoil of last year.
Issuance has remained strong, however, in July and into August, despite the fact
that ABS sales are typically weak in the early part of each quarter. Indeed,
compared to July 1998, last month's ABS issuance was quite high.
Government Securities Markets
The federal government estimates that in the current quarter it will pay down
$11 billion of marketable securities, assuming a $45 billion cash balance by
quarter-end. The Treasury's midquarter financing auctions last week were well
received and raised $37 billion in notes and bonds. The Treasury has stated that
it plans to build up its cash balance to $80 billion by year-end, from about
$40 billion at the end of July and $17-1/2 billion at the end of last year. The
extra cash over the century date change will be used to back up the Federal
Financing Bank's $20 billion line to credit unions and will also serve as a
safeguard against any Y2K-related disruptions to receipts or securities offerings.
The additional funding will be done through modestly increasing weekly bill
offerings and through cash management bills. The weekly bill auction increased
$1 billion at the beginning of August. Further increases in the weekly bill

auction size probably will be limited to an additional $1 billion; consequently,
for the Treasury to achieve its targeted increase in cash balances will require
outsized offerings of cash management bills toward the end of the year.
The Treasury also announced several steps to maintain the liquidity of the
market for its securities in the face of dwindling public debt. Most significantly,
it released for public comment a plan to repurchase off-the-run securities, with a
possible initiation of the program as early as January. Doing so would allow it
to maintain larger issuance sizes, trim the maturity of the outstanding debt, and
absorb seasonal excesses in cash. In addition, the Treasury announced that it
would no longer issue thirty-year bonds in November but would limit its bond
offerings to February and August. The Treasury is also considering reducing the
frequency of its issuance of one-year bills and two-year notes.
Agency debt issuance has remained strong during the intermeeting period, with
offerings from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank
System totaling nearly $25 billion. Fannie Mae's issues included an estimated
$2-1/2 billion increase in its on-the-run ten-year benchmark note, which was
exchanged for outstanding securities having about seven to eight years to
maturity. This is the second debt exchange for Fannie Mae so far this year.
The entire amount of global bonds issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank
System during the intermeeting period came through a new Tap Issue Program.
Under this program, noncallable debt securities with two- to ten-year maturities
will be sold and then reopened regularly over a three-month period through
competitive auctions to reach potential outstanding issue size of $1 billion to
$3 billion. The new program should combine the flexibility of daily issuance
and the liquidity of large outstanding size (comparable to those of its jumbo
global bonds). The Federal Home Loan Bank System also launched callable
jumbo bonds, which will have two years or more to maturity. The minimum
issue size is $1 billion for new issues and $100 million for reopenings.
Municipal Finance
After surging in June, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed in
July, though it remained strong at nearly $19 billion; weekly data for August
point to another robust month. New capital issuance in July and thus far in
August has maintained its relatively high pace of the past few years, boosted
particularly by spending on education. Refunding activity, which has generally
remained subdued this year, was boosted somewhat in July by two large deals, at

least one of which was made profitable when the issuer's credit rating was
raised.6
Yields on long-term municipal bonds have risen about in line with Treasuries
since the June FOMC meeting, and yield ratios have been relatively stable.
Although investors' demand for municipal bonds has generally remained solid,
heavy supply has kept yield ratios high by historical standards.
The credit quality of municipal issuers remained strong and generally showed
improvement. Over the past few years, Standard and Poor's has consistently
issued more upgrades than downgrades, in terms of both number of ratings
actions and the par value of bonds rated. The exception continued to be the
health care industry, where government regulation and managed care penetration
have been taking a toll on earnings.
Money and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates posted moderate growth in July for a third
consecutive month. M2 grew at a 5 percent rate, restrained to a small degree by
the rise in opportunity costs associated with the policy tightening of late June
and the general rise in market interest rates of late. M2 growth for the second
quarter, at 5-3/4 percent, still exceeded GDP growth, and the velocity of this
aggregate decreased at a 1-3/4 percent pace, somewhat faster than in the first
quarter. Since the fourth quarter of 1998, M2 has expanded at a 6 percent rate,
1 percentage point above the FOMC's long-run range but 2-1/2 percentage
points less than in 1998.
M3 grew at a 4-3/4 percent rate in July, continuing its slower growth of recent
months. Institutional money funds--whose yields typically lag increases in
market rates--suffered outflows because some large investors shifted to direct
investments in market instruments. From the fourth quarter of last year through
July, M3 grew at a 6 percent pace, at the upper end of the FOMC's long-run
range.
Restraining M3 growth in recent months also has been the modest needs of
depositories to increase funding, given the tepid growth of their assets. Indeed,
bank credit was about flat in July, weakening further from the sluggish average
pace over the first two quarters of the year. Very large securitizations of
consumer and home equity loans by banks that elected to hold the resulting
securities caused a substantial boost to the growth of the securities component of
bank credit in July and a corresponding weakening of loan growth. Even

abstracting from these transactions, however, loan growth in July was quite
weak and securities growth strong. Loan growth was held down by a slowdown
in business loans and a sharp runoff of security loans.
Preliminary Call Report data indicate that commercial banks' returns on assets
and equity in the second quarter reversed some of the improvement in the first
quarter but remained high. Capital ratios were little changed, and the vast
majority of banks continue to be well-capitalized.

Appendix
August Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
on Bank Lending Practices
The August 1999 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices focused
primarily on changes over the past three months in the supply of and demand for bank loans to
businesses and households. Additional questions addressed Year 2000 (Y2K) issues and loan
quality. Loan officers from fifty-six large domestic banks and twenty-two U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey. The responses suggest that banks became
somewhat more cautious lenders over the past quarter but show no widespread reduction in credit
availability.
The results indicate a continued slight firming of business lending practices. For domestic
banks, this has taken the form more of a tightening of terms on C&I loans, particularly risk
premiums and loan rate spreads, as only a few reported that they had strengthened underwriting
standards. In contrast, large proportions of the branches and agencies tightened both standards
and terms on C&I loans. Similarly, for commercial real estate loans, a small fraction of domestic
banks and a larger fraction of branches and agencies raised standards.
The survey found little evidence of any changes in standards and terms on loans to households.
A small net fraction indicated greater willingness to make consumer installment loans, and
virtually no banks indicated any change in standards for or terms on credit card and other
consumer loans. Demand for consumer loans was also reported to be about unchanged, but many
banks said that demand for home mortgages had decreased.
To a large extent, the respondents said they were willing to extend special contingency lines of
credit over year-end, at least to existing customers, but most had not received requests for such
lines. The banks were not, in general, tightening terms and standards on renewals of existing
lines over year-end. Those banks limiting credit lines over year-end were chiefly concerned
about Y2K effects on borrowers' repayment prospects, although several were also worried about
the effect of borrowing on capital ratios, and about possible difficulties they might encounter in
funding draws on credit lines over year-end. A large majority of the respondents appeared
willing to use the Federal Reserve's recently announced Special Liquidity Facility. Those
expressing reluctance to use the facility cited as reasons difficulties with collateral procedures
and stigma associated with borrowing at the discount window.
The respondents indicated that over the past year the performance of their business loan
portfolios had become more sensitive to a period of economic weakness, primarily because of a
weaker financial condition of borrowers, but also because of eased lending standards and terms.
Banks assessed the sensitivity of their household loan portfolio to an economic slowdown to
have changed little over the past year.
Lending to Businesses
About 5 percent of the domestic bank respondents said that over the past three months, they had
tightened standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market borrowers (down from 10 percent
in May), and 25 percent of the branch and agency respondents said that they had tightened (about
the same as in May). The survey found no change, on net, in standards on loans to small
businesses. On net, about a fourth of the domestic banks and more than half of the branches and

Part 2: Recent Developments, August 18, 1999
agencies reported tightening terms on C&I loans, particularly risk premiums, spreads of loan
rates over the banks' cost of funds, and costs of credit lines. The net percentages tightening
terms increased a bit relative to those recorded on the May survey. However, in the case of both
standards and terms, the net percentages tightening are significantly lower than those reported
last fall. The loan officers most commonly cited a worsening of industry-specific problems, a
less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, and a reduced tolerance for risk as the
reasons for having tightened.
On net, no domestic bank respondents said that demand for C&I loans had changed over the
preceding three months (neither from large and middle-market firms nor from small businesses).
The branch and agency responses also showed virtually no change in demand. Those
respondents reporting a change in demand generally attributed it to variation in their customers'
merger and acquisition and plant and equipment financing needs.
As in May, less than 10 percent of domestic bank respondents, on net, reported tighter standards
on commercial real estate loans. By contrast, nearly 40 percent of branch and agency
respondents tightened standards on these loans, a larger percentage than in May. About
10 percent, on net, of the domestic bank respondents said that demand for commercial mortgages
had increased over the past three months; branch and agency respondents also reported little
change in demand. Only about half of the foreign bank respondents answered the questions on
commercial real estate loans, likely reflecting the departure of many of the branches and agencies
from this line of business.
Lending to Households
As in recent quarters, banks appear not to have made any significant adjustments to their
consumer lending policies following the pronounced tightening that began in the mid-1990s.
About 10 percent of the respondents, on net, said their willingness to make consumer installment
loans had gone up over the preceding three months. Only two banks tightened standards on
credit cards; and three, on net, tightened standards on other consumer loans. Terms on these
loans were also reported as little changed. About 10 percent of the banks, on net, reported
stronger demand for consumer loans.
The survey also found little evidence of changed standards for home mortgages, with one bank,
on net, easing. A large net percentage--35 percent--said that demand for home mortgages had
decreased, whereas in May respondents had reported increased demand. Even though the
question specifically asks about demand for mortgages to purchase homes as opposed to
refinancing existing mortgages, the reported decrease in demand still likely reflects, in part, a
decline in refinancing activity.
Year 2000
The respondents reported continued progress toward mitigating the Year 2000 risks posed by
their customers. More than 90 percent of the domestic banks, up from 70 percent in May, had
evaluated the Y2K preparedness of at least 90 percent of their material business customers.
About 80 percent of branch and agencies had evaluated 90 percent of their customers, up only a
little from May. About 95 percent of the banks surveyed stated that less than 5 percent of their
customers that had been evaluated were not making satisfactory progress toward achieving Y2K
preparedness.III-A-2

Domestic Financial Developments, Appendix
The survey results indicate that requests for Year 2000 contingency lines of credit have been
limited to date. Relatively small percentages of the domestic bank respondents had received
requests for such lines from nonfinancial and financial firms--10 percent and 20 percent
respectively. These percentages, however, are about twice as large as found in May. Branch and
agency respondents were less likely to have received requests for such lines. The requests that
banks had received for contingency lines were from many different types of financial firms, with
the largest number having received requests from domestic commercial banks, followed by
finance companies, mutual funds, and savings and loans. Some of the loan officers noted that
although they have received relatively few requests to date for contingency lines, the requests
they had received were, in some cases, substantial, and they thought that more requests may be
forthcoming.
All the domestic bank respondents were willing to extend Y2K contingency lines, but nearly
two-thirds--a larger fraction than in May--would do so only for existing customers. About a third
of branches and agencies were unwilling to extend contingency lines; the remainder were willing
to extend such lines only to existing customers. A fourth of the domestic banks, up from about
15 percent in May, had tightened standards or terms on renewals of existing lines that extended
into next year but were not specifically meant to meet year-end funding needs. Those banks that
were adjusting policies on renewals were tightening standards, raising spreads or fees, requiring
a rate premium for advances around year-end, or pricing lines off of their own cost of funds
rather than off independent indexes (such as LIBOR). By contrast, two-thirds of the branches
and agencies were adjusting policies on renewals, including limiting the usage of lines over year-
end. Those respondents (domestic and foreign) that were unwilling to extend Year 2000
contingency lines of credit, were limiting such lines to existing customers, or had tightened
standards or terms on renewals of existing lines gave a variety of reasons for their reluctance.
Most commonly, the respondents were concerned about Y2K effects on borrowers' repayment
prospects, difficulty funding draws on credit lines over year-end, and the effect of borrowing on
capital ratios, but also about credit quality generally.
Several questions addressed the willingness of respondents to use the Century Date Change
Special Liquidity Facility (SLF), which will make discount window credit readily available to
depository institutions in sound financial condition at a 150 basis point premium over the
FOMC's target federal funds rate between October 1, 1999, and April 7, 2000. Nearly 70
percent of the domestic and foreign respondents said they would not be likely to borrow
overnight funds in the market at a rate greater than that charged by the SLF. Of the institutions
that would pay more for funds to avoid borrowing from the SLF, a third thought it likely they
would pay more than 50 basis points in excess of the SLF rate to do so. Those that would be
willing to pay a premium to avoid borrowing at the SLF cited as the reasons difficulties with
collateral procedures and limitations on the amount of collateral the institution has available to
pledge, resistance by senior management to borrowing at the discount window, and concern that
use of the facility would be viewed negatively either by bank regulators or by market
participants.1 Over 80 percent of the respondents said that the existence of the SLF had not
changed their willingness to extend Year 2000 contingency lines of credit.
1. As noted in the questionnaire, absent signs of financial trouble, use of the Special Liquidity Facility
will not be taken as an indication of underlying problems and will not trigger intensified oversight by
supervisory authorities. As also noted, the Federal Reserve treats information on individual bank borrowing
at the discount window as confidential.III-A-3

III-A-4 Part 2: Recent Developments, August 18, 1999
Loan Quality
Two special questions addressed changes in loan quality over the past year. On net, the domestic
respondents said that the delinquency and charge-off rates of their credit card and other
consumer loans had not become more sensitive to a period of economic weakness over the past
year, although a few said their residential real estate loans had become more sensitive. A small
net percentage of the domestic and foreign respondents, about 15 percent, judged their
commercial real estate loans to have become more sensitive to a downturn. However, about a
third of the domestic and foreign respondents, on net, said their C&I loan portfolios had become
more sensitive. Domestic banks most commonly attributed the heightened sensitivity of their
C&I loan portfolios to borrowers' greater financial leverage and banks' eased lending standards
and terms and also noted borrowers' narrower profit margins and reduced cash-flow projections.
Branches and agencies also stressed a shift in the composition of borrowers toward riskier
credits.

Trade in Goods and Services
In May, the nominal U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $21.3 billion.
The deficit increased $2.7 billion from April, revised, as the value of exports
declined slightly and the value of imports rose. For April-May combined, the
nominal U.S. trade deficit in goods and services increased to $240 billion at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate. Data for June will be released on August 19 and
will be reviewed in the Greenbook Supplement.

The value of exports fell 3/4 percent in May, following a 1-1/2 percent increase
in April. The declines were primarily in aircraft, consumer goods, automotive
products, and gold. Increased exports of automotive products to Canada and
Mexico only partly offset declines to other destinations. Exports of industrial
supplies increased for the second consecutive month, largely due to fuels. For
April-May combined, the value of exports rose 3/4 percent over the first quarter
level, with increases spread over most major trade categories, except for a sharp
drop in aircraft exports.
The value of imports rose 2 percent in May, increasing for the fifth consecutive
month. The largest increases were in imports of oil, automotive products, and
all the major categories of capital goods. Imports of consumer goods declined,
following an upturn in April. For April-May combined, the value of imports
rose 2-3/4 percent over the first quarter level, with much of the increase due to a
higher value of oil imports.

Quantity and price of imported oil. The value of imported oil increased
substantially in May as a modest rise in quantity augmented the effects of
sharply higher prices. For April-May combined, the price of imported oil, at
$14.50 per barrel, was 40 percent above the first quarter level. Reduced
supplies, primarily from OPEC, fueled the rise in oil prices.
More recently, oil prices have increased further as OPEC continues to adhere to
its production restraint agreements. The monthly average spot price of West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) has increased from $17.75 in May to over $20 per
barrel in July. Supply disruptions in Nigeria, strengthening world demand, and
lower inventories have also contributed to higher prices. Spot WTI is currently
trading above $21 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. In July, prices of non-oil imports fell
slightly as declines in the prices of computers and semiconductors offset a small
increase in the price of "core" imports. Among core goods, higher prices of
imported industrial supplies and a marginal increase for automotive products
were partly offset by declines in the prices for foods, machinery, and consumer
goods. For the second quarter of 1999, prices of non-oil imports decreased 2
percent at an annual rate, a somewhat larger rate of decline than in the previous
two quarters. Prices of core imports declined 1 percent at an annual rate
following two quarters of virtually no price change. The decline in core prices
reflected a swing from increases to decreases in the prices of machinery and
consumer goods that was only partly offset by increases in the prices of
imported industrial supplies, foods, and automotive products.
Prices of total exports fell slightly in July, the first decrease since March, due to
declines in the prices of agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors.
Prices of core exports did not change as higher prices for exported industrial
supplies, machinery, and automotive products were offset by lower prices of
consumer goods. In the second quarter, prices of total exports declined slightly,
primarily due to lower prices of agricultural exports and continued declines in
the prices of computers and semiconductors. Prices of core exports rose about
1-1/2 percent at an annual rate, led by increases in industrial supplies. This
increase followed little change in core export prices in the first quarter.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
In the second quarter of 1999 foreign official assets held in the United States
remained largely unchanged (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table). A sizeable reduction in European reserves was mostly
offset by an increase in Japanese reserves. Venezuela and Saudi Arabia also
registered increases in their reserves in the second quarter in concert with the
rebound in oil prices. Corresponding to reported intervention this summer,
Japanese reserves increased sharply in June and partial data from the FRBNY
indicate that Japanese reserves jumped again in July. Although Brazilian
reserves were up significantly and Chilean reserves remained unchanged for the
quarter, both countries decreased their reserves markedly in June.
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners remained strong in the
second quarter of 1999 (line 4). They were concentrated in corporate securities
(lines 4b and 4c), while holdings of Treasury securities (line 4a) declined
modestly. The move out of Treasuries was more than offset by foreign net
purchases of agency bonds, which made up about one-third of net purchases of
U.S. corporate bonds in both June and the second quarter. Transactions through
financial centers in Europe and the Caribbean accounted for most of the large net
purchases of stocks and bonds in June.
U.S. investors continued selling foreign bonds and stocks on net in the late
spring and early summer (line 5). Second quarter sales of foreign securities were
concentrated in the United Kingdom, with an especially large sell-off in June.
The U.K. net sales were partially offset by large net purchases of Japanese stocks,
in the second quarter. U.S. holdings of Latin American securities also increased
in the second quarter as a result of sizeable global bond issues in April by
Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico; however, U.S. residents sold securities on net
from these three countries in June.
Moderate inflows through banking offices in the United States continued in the
second quarter (line 3), with inflows in May and June more than offsetting April
outflows. U.S.-chartered banks were largely responsible for the net inflow.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the June FOMC meeting, the dollar has depreciated 2-1/2 percent in terms
of the major currencies index, but has appreciated about 1 percent in terms of the
currencies of our other important trading partners. The dollar depreciated 7
percent versus the yen, 2 percent against the euro, and 1-1/2 percent in terms of
sterling. The bulk of the dollar's decline against the major currencies began in
mid-July amid data releases suggesting a pickup in activity in Europe and
possibly Japan, and despite increasing market expectations of monetary
tightening in the United States.

The yen's movement against the dollar occurred in two major episodes, with
much of the movement coming very late in the intermeeting period. The yen's
strength appeared to reflect an ongoing reassessment among market participants
of the prospects for Japanese financial assets and the underlying economy. The
Bank of Japan maintained its policy stance with the overnight call rate at only a
few basis points, and benchmark government bond yields increased slightly over
the period. Despite the reports of improved market sentiment towards Japan, the
Nikkei index was little changed on balance, reportedly due in part to concerns
that the strengthening yen may affect the profitability of exporting firms and
threaten Japan's budding recovery. The same concerns led Japanese monetary

IV-9
authorities to intervene three times in July to weaken the yen,
.Since the latest operation on July 21, the yen has appreciated another
5 percent.

The euro came within one cent of parity with the dollar in the middle of July, but
rose quickly afterwards as signs of economic recovery in France and Germany
became more abundant. Ten-year government bond yields rose more than 30
basis points in the euro area over the intermeeting period, while the yields on
comparable U.S. Treasuries were little changed. Expectations that the European
Central Bank would raise interest rates 50 basis points or more during the year
2000 became more prevalent; these interest rate expectations were seen as a
factor behind the slight decline in share prices in Germany and France.
During the period, as data pointing to recovery in the United Kingdom were
released, market participants also came to believe that the next interest rate
move by the Bank of England would be up, rather than down, which had been
the prevailing opinion in late June. These beliefs were tempered by projections
that inflation would remain below the Monetary Policy Committee's target for
the next two years. British assets generally outperformed euro-area assets, with
ten-year gilt yields increasing only about 15 basis points, and share prices in
London up slightly on balance.

IV-10
A measure of anxiousness returned to the financial markets of emerging
economies during the intermeeting period, both in Asia and in Latin America. In
Asia, the renewed tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as the
increasingly open discussion within China of the possible devaluation of the
renminbi, were reflected in falling equity prices in much of the region. The
dollar appreciated about 4 percent versus the Thai baht, the Korean won, and the
Philippine peso. The dollar appreciated 10 percent against the Indonesian rupiah
amid continued political unrest and increasing doubts about the reform of
Indonesia's financial sector.

In Latin America, financial markets appeared particularly sensitive to prospects
for rising interest rates in the United States. The Brazilian real depreciated 6-1/4

crude oil prices. Concerns over the viability of Argentina's currency board did
not abate, as the recession appeared to deepen and political uncertainty increased
ahead of this fall's presidential election. Equity prices fell close to 13 percent in
Brazil, 8 percent in Argentina, and 6 percent in Mexico. Brady yield spreads

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent data suggest that economic activity in the foreign industrial countries
generally has continued to firm. While the most recent production data for the
euro zone are lackluster, forward-looking indicators suggest continuing
economic recovery. Euro-zone consumer and business confidence improved in
July, and German manufacturing orders rose sharply in the second quarter. U.K.
real GDP rose 2 percent in the second quarter after two quarters of little growth,
with industrial production registering the first quarterly increase in a year.
Canadian economic growth has remained strong, and recent increases in
manufacturing orders and manufacturing employment indicate momentum in the
industrial sector. In contrast, Japanese data on industrial production,
employment, and orders suggest that growth in the second quarter has stalled
following the surprising surge in GDP in the first quarter.
Inflationary pressures have remained subdued in these countries. Japanese
consumer prices were unchanged over the 12 months to July. Twelve-month
euro-area inflation has stayed around 1 percent. Inflation in the United Kingdom
remains below the 2.5 percent target rate, while Canadian inflation has picked up
a bit recently to just below the mid-point of its 1 to 3 percent target range.
In Japan, economic indicators provide little evidence of sustained recovery.
Industrial production during the second quarter was down 3.8 percent (SAAR)
from the first-quarter average, and MITI's index of service sector activity during
April and May was down 0.8 percent from the first quarter. Unemployment in
June reached a postwar high of 4.9 percent, and the offers-to-applicants ratio
remained at a record low. Second-quarter data on machinery orders and capital
goods shipments also suggest profound weakness. By contrast, the real
household expenditure series surged 8 percent during the second quarter, but the
marked divergence between this series and NIA private consumption during the
first quarter raises questions about how these data should be interpreted.
Housing starts continued to rise during the second quarter, supported by
government incentives. The Tokyo-area CPI in July was unchanged from a year
earlier.
The BOJ's June Tankan survey showed an improvement in business confidence,
although the level of confidence remained low. The diffusion index for
aggregate business sentiment (across all sizes of firms and all industries)
increased from -44 in March to -37 in June, with sentiment among large
manufacturers rising from -47 to -37. Firms expect conditions to show further
improvement over the next three months.

IV-13
Japan's merchandise trade surplus during the first half of 1999 was $109 billion
at an annual rate, essentially unchanged from the $108 billion surplus during all
of 1998. Measured in dollars, imports and exports during the first half were both
up about 2 percent from their 1998 averages.

Recent indicators for the European Union countries in the euro zone suggest
that the economic recovery is getting back on track, with forward-looking
indicators showing considerable improvement in the last few months. However
the upturn remains fragile and uneven across countries, with growth rates in
some of the smaller countries (notably Ireland, Spain, and Portugal) continuing
to outpace performance in Germany, France, and Italy.
Industrial production for the euro zone as a whole turned up in May, but the
April-May average was a little below the first-quarter level. Unemployment
rates remain at high levels in most euro-zone countries.
Price pressures continue to be mild, although CPI data for July for Germany,
Italy and, to a lesser extent, France showed an uptick in twelve-month inflation
that has been linked primarily to higher energy prices. For the euro-area as a
whole, harmonized twelve-month consumer price inflation dipped back below

IV-14
1.0 percent in June, considerably below the ECB's target ceiling of 2 percent.
Sizable differences still exist among individual countries, however, with
inflation rates in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and France all below 1 percent,
while rates in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland are still a little above
2 percent.

In contrast to the lackluster production data, forward-looking indicators have
turned quite positive. German manufacturing orders were up sharply in the
second quarter, and the euro-zone indicator of economic sentiment rose in June,
with increases in all three components of the index-industrial, consumer, and
construction. The increase was also widespread across the major countries, with
gains posted in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.
Elections to the European parliament were held in June, and a conservative
majority was voted into power. This likely will increase the pressure on most
governments to proceed with market-oriented economic reforms but may also
lead to greater economic policy divergence among the major European countries.

IV-15
In Germany, the election results suggested a weakening of the ruling social-
democratic party and were interpreted as a negative verdict on the Schroeder
government's economic policy record. The government responded with a
renewed promise to cut corporate tax rates to 25 percent by 2001 and make other
pro-business tax changes. By contrast, in France the election result supported
Jospin's left-wing coalition and is likely to reinforce France's determination to
stick to its present economic policy course.

Recent indicators point to recovery in the pace of economic activity in the
United Kingdom. After registering little growth in the previous two quarters,
real GDP expanded 2 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. Industrial
production rose 0.6 percent, with the manufacturing sector registering the first
quarterly increase in over a year. Retail sales remained strong, with the average
volume of sales increasing 0.9 percent over the quarter and somewhat further in
July. Business and consumer confidence have slipped somewhat since May but
remain well above lows reached late last year.
Conditions in the labor market remain healthy. The official unemployment rate
edged down to 4.3 percent in July, and the Labor Force Survey unemployment
rate improved to 6.0 percent for the April-June period.

Inflationary pressures remain contained, with the twelve-month rate of retail
price inflation (excluding mortgage interest rates) comfortably below the official
target of 2.5 percent. Producer input prices for materials and fuel have edged up
since April, primarily reflecting higher oil prices.
In its August Inflation Report, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of
England said that it had raised its near-term outlook for real GDP growth,
reflecting improved prospects for both domestic demand and net exports.
However, its near-term inflation forecast was somewhat weaker, as recent data
on wages and prices had been weaker than anticipated.
Economic growth in Canada has continued to expand at a brisk pace. Real
GDP at factor cost rose sharply in both April and May, led by sharp increases in
demand for telecommunication products, computers, and business services. This
was offset to some extent by a slowdown in manufacturing from the sharp
increase in activity earlier this year. However, a large increase in new
manufacturing orders in May and a surge in manufacturing employment in July
suggest that industrial production has already regained momentum and begun to
post healthy gains. Furthermore, a rise in overall business confidence in the
second quarter and recent surveys of capital spending intentions by firms suggest
that overall investment spending should remain strong in the near term.

Despite these indications of robust investment spending, employment failed to
expand during the second quarter. This weakness in employment to some extent
offsets large increases in jobs in latter part of 1998, and employment in July rose
sharply, confirming some of the strength in investment demand. The
unemployment rate also continued to move lower, after spiking up in April.
After surging in the first quarter, gains in consumer spending have fallen back to
more sustainable increases. Retail sales in April/May were up only 0.6 from the
first quarter, compared to a 2.5 percent rise in the first quarter. Similarly,
housing starts were up only 1.2 percent in the second quarter, compared to a
hefty 5.8 percent increase in the first quarter.
The period of very low inflation experienced at the end of 1998 and early 1999
appears to have ended. CPI inflation rose sharply in April and May, partly due
to higher energy prices, and has remained above 1.5 percent in more recent
months, rising to 1.8 percent in July. Inflation expectations, as measured by
yields on Canadian index-linked bonds, have also continued to move higher in
recent months. And, the effective twelve-month average increase in wages in
new collective bargaining agreements was 2.3 percent in April and May, after
averaging only 1.5 percent in the first quarter.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In developing Asia the economic recovery appears to be gathering momentum,
with China being the notable exception. Indications from Latin America are
somewhat mixed. Economic growth accelerated in Mexico and continued to
recover in Brazil. However, in Argentina the deep recession continues, and,
despite the turnaround in oil prices, the Venezuelan economy continues to falter
amid political uncertainty. There is also not much evidence of an increase in
inflationary pressures in the region; inflation continued to be negative in
Argentina and was roughly constant in Mexico and Venezuela, although Brazil
experienced a slight increase. Recessionary pressures have turned the Argentine
trade deficit into a surplus and narrowed Venezuela's non-oil trade deficit. The
Brazilian trade deficit has also narrowed, but that of Mexico widened slightly in
June after the narrowing that resulted from strong export growth in recent
months.
In developing Asia, Korea and the ASEAN countries continued to display robust
growth, although Indonesian GDP growth retreated in the second quarter from
its very rapid first quarter pace. Growth was also strong in Taiwan, but the
Hong Kong economy remains weak, and the pace of growth slowed sharply in
China, amid renewed fears of a possible devaluation. Consistent with strong
growth, the trade surpluses of the ASEAN countries as well as those of Korea
and Taiwan have narrowed. In China exports continue to improve, reflecting in
large part an improvement in other Asian economies. Inflation throughout
developing Asia has continued to range from negative to moderate.
In Russia economic activity appears to be recovering, but the political landscape
has changed again with yet another reshuffling of the cabinet.
In Brazil, economic growth has been surprisingly high in the first half of the
year; second-quarter real GDP grew by 3.8 percent (SAAR), following a rise of
4.1 percent in the first quarter. However, unemployment in June rose to
7.6 percent from 7.2 percent (SA) in May. Moreover, industrial output declined
in June, although for the second quarter as a whole it rose 1.6 percent. Inflation
has also risen recently; the consumer price index rose approximately 0.3 percent
(SA) in July, largely due to hikes in administered fuel prices, after showing
deflation (reflecting mainly declines in food prices) over the second quarter.
The trade deficit for the first seven months of the year has narrowed relative to
its level over the same period last year, but not by as much as hoped, reflecting
mainly declines in export prices and weak demand from Argentina and other
Latin American trading partners.

IV-22
A turbulent political situation is fueling skepticism about the political
determination to tackle Brazil's fiscal problems. Stories of infighting within the
coalition of political parties supporting President Cardoso prompted him in late
July to reorganize executive level appointments, a move that observers regard as
positive. Nonetheless, court challenges to several taxes and a social security
reform that are crucial to the fiscal reform effort are still pending; the supreme
court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of these changes soon. A recent
"anti-poverty" proposal that seems to involve a tax on the rich has gained
political momentum, raising some concerns that congress will be distracted from
more pressing fiscal problems.

In late June, the central bank unveiled its inflation targeting system, an effort
that is aimed at strengthening its anti-inflation credibility. The target is
8 percent in 1999, 6 percent in 2000, and 4 percent in 2001 (December-over-
December basis). A 2 percentage point cushion on either side of the target is
specified, and the central bank will issue explanations should inflation surpass
the target. Since the last FOMC meeting, the Brazilian central bank has
continued to reduce interest rates, albeit much more slowly than it had earlier
this year. The overnight Selic rate, which declined from 45 percent in early
March to 21 percent in late June, was lowered to 19.5 percent in late July. The
downward "bias" to interest rates was also eliminated, meaning that interest
rates will not be changed until the central bank open market committee meets

IV-23
again in September. Senior central bank officials have nonetheless stressed that
interest rates could continue to decline over the rest of 1999.
In late July, the IMF Executive Board approved Brazil's third disbursement of
$2.3 billion from its $18 billion stand-by. Notably, Brazil met its fiscal
performance criterion for the first half of the year, with available data indicating
that the primary surplus surpassed the target of 3 percent of GDP. However,
about one percentage point of that surplus reflected non-recurring revenues, and
continued passage and implementation of reforms are still needed to achieve
lasting fiscal stability.
In Mexico, the pace of economic growth appears to be accelerating; seasonally-
adjusted real GDP grew at a healthy annual rate of 7.7 percent in the second
quarter, and industrial production also continued to grow in June. The
seasonally-adjusted trade deficit, which had narrowed in recent months due to
strong exports, widened again in June to $7.4 billion (AR). The recovery in real
activity has not pushed up inflation and the 12-month inflation rate remained at
around 17 percent in July.
The new Bank Deposit Insurance Institute (IPAB), created recently to rescue the
bank bailout fund, Fobaproa, is up and running. A schedule has been announced
for collecting quotas from banks and for the gradual reduction of limits on
deposit insurance to $100,000 per account. The audit report resulting from an
independent probe into Fobaproa also released its report in late July. It found
the cost of the bailout to be higher than previously estimated, and identified
$72.7 billion pesos (about $7.7 billion) in loans linked to the bailout as
"questionable," but was not prepared to say whether they were illegal or not.
The results of the audit were much less detrimental and embarrassing to the
ruling party than some observers and opposition leaders had been predicting.
In July, the IMF Executive Board approved a new standby agreement for
Mexico. Under the agreement, Mexico will receive $4.1 billion from the IMF,
essentially offsetting payments on Mexico's 1995 IMF loan until 2001. In
addition, loans of $5.2 billion from the World Bank and $3.5 billion from the
Inter-American Development Bank for social programs and infrastructure
developments will allow Mexico to ease pressures on public sector funding.
These loans, in addition to the $4 billion credit line from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank, will cover nearly 80 percent of the public sector's expected external debt
service in 2000 and provide about 35 percent of total debt service.
Recently some financial market pressures returned amid general regional
concerns about Latin America and market expectations of a U.S. interest rate
increase, although they abated somewhat last week. On balance, over the past

IV-24
two months the Mexican stock market has declined about 8 percent, the
benchmark 28-day treasury bill (cete) rate has risen by 80 basis points to
20.2 percent, and the Mexican peso is roughly unchanged.

In Argentina, recent economic data indicates that the current recession is deeper
than previously believed, and uncertainty surrounding the political elections in
October continues to unsettle financial markets. Industrial production was down
in July on a seasonally adjusted basis and has declined 12.5 percent over the past
twelve months, and the unemployment rate reached 14.5 percent in May.
Weakness in exports has been more than matched by a drop off in imports, and
Argentina ran a trade surplus in the second quarter-the first surplus since 1997.
Falling output and rising unemployment have contributed to a 1.5 percent drop
in consumer prices over the 12 months ended July.
The presidential election is two months away, and uncertainty about the
economic policies of the candidates is translating into market volatility. In
particular, comments by presidential hopeful Eduardo Duhalde pushing for debt
relief were largely behind the almost 9 percent drop in the Argentine stock
market on July 12. Although recovering slightly upon a retraction by Duhalde,
the stock market is down over about 9 percent since the beginning of July; both
interest rates and currency futures rates suggest that investors' expected

IV-25
probability of a peso devaluation has increased significantly since early June.
Rates are unlikely to come down until the economic stance of the new president
becomes clear following the election.

In Venezuela, a weak economy has taken a back seat to politics with the election
in July of members to a popular assembly charged with rewriting the constitution
by the end of the year. While GDP data on the first quarter may not be released
until the end of the year, the Venezuelan Finance department stated that they
projected real GDP to fall between 3 and 5 percent in 1999 (annual average
change)--well below their earlier forecasts of a 2 to 3 percent decline. Imports
and non-oil exports continued to contract sharply as the recession held down
imports and the overvalued bolivar cut into exports. The unemployment rate has
been steadily rising and hit 16.7 percent in June after averaging 11.2 percent in
1998. On a positive note, the recession is containing inflation--consumer prices
rose 23.2 percent over the 12-months ended July after increasing close to
40 percent over the same period a year ago.
On the political front, President Hugo Chavez won a major victory when his
supporters captured 90 percent of the seats of the Constitutional assembly. In
mid-August, the assembly declared Venezuela in a state of emergency, giving it
the power to take action in virtually all areas of public life. So far, the changes
outlined in Chavez's proposals for the new constitution have been relatively

IV-26
conservative on the economic front. However, political uncertainty may dampen
investor enthusiasm and delay the economic recovery.

In Korea, the pace of the recovery has remained robust. Industrial production
increased strongly in both May and June following a dip in April, and, for the
second quarter as a whole, rose at a 6 percent annual rate. The capacity
utilization rate, which had reached a low of 66 percent last year, moved up
further to 80 percent in June, about the level prevailing before the late 1997
financial crisis. The unemployment rate eased further to 6.4 percent in June.
Notwithstanding the speed of the recovery, inflation has remained very low, with
consumer prices continuing to register a 12-month increase of less than 1 percent
in July. With activity recovering strongly, the trade and current account
surpluses have continued to shrink. Through the first half of the year, the current
surplus was down nearly 40 percent compared with the first half of last year.
Daewoo, Korea's second largest conglomerate (chaebol), experienced a financial
crisis in late July that triggered a 10 percent drop in stock prices--a reminder that
the process of corporate and financial restructuring remains incomplete, and that
the economic recovery could still be derailed by faltering in this regard. A
government-arranged rescue package, involving new short-term loans from
Daewoo's domestic creditors, defused the immediate threat that Daewoo would
default on its commercial paper and bonds. In return for this support, Daewoo

IV-27
promised to implement a restructuring program that would force the
conglomerate to sell off all but six auto-related units by end-1999.

Recent developments in the ASEAN countries indicate that economic activity in
the region has bottomed out, and a recovery in output has begun. Indonesian
GDP retreated slightly in the second quarter, possibly as a result of disruptions
caused by the June parliamentary elections, after very rapid growth in the first
quarter. In Singapore, second-quarter GDP growth was remarkably strong. A
rebound in the global electronics market fueled rapid growth in industrial
production in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, while industrial production
ceased its decline and began to grow moderately in the Philippines.
Notwithstanding increasing export values across the region, trade surpluses have
begun to narrow since late last year as import growth has resumed. Malaysia
and Thailand recorded double-digit seasonally adjusted, month-on-month
increases in June imports. Indonesian exports and imports fell in June, but this
may have been due to uncertainty associated with that month's elections.
ASEAN financial markets have retreated partially from the surge earlier this year
for a variety of reasons. In Malaysia, some of the sell-off may be related to
preparation by foreign investors to repatriate funds on September 1 as the one-
year holding period mandated by last year's imposition of capital controls comes
to an end. The currencies of the Philippines and Thailand have weakened
recently on fears of a devaluation of the renminbi early next year. The
Indonesian rupiah has plunged more than ten percent since end-June, hurt in part
by negative market sentiment regarding possible malfeasance on the part of the

IV-28
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency in its handling of the assets of Bank Bali,
a nationalized bank due to be sold to Standard Chartered Bank of the United
Kingdom. Soft domestic demand continues to dampen inflation across the
region.

The government of Malaysia announced that it expects the country's 21
domestic banks, 25 finance companies and 12 merchant banks to merge into six
financial groups by end-September 1999. Finance Minister Daim insisted that
the health of the banking sector is the sole reason for this enforced consolidation,
but many observers note that all financial firms associated with the deposed
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim are expected to disappear under this scheme,
and banks headed by persons close to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will
act as the consolidators. The Thailand cabinet approved a new investment
stimulus program that includes funds to aid businesses in investment and debt
restructuring, subsidized mortgages for middle-to-low income households, tax
breaks for businesses and tariffs reductions on imports of materials and capital
goods. In Indonesia, parliamentary election results were finally ratified.
Megawati Sukaroputri's reformist PDI-P won 34 percent of the popular vote
and B. J. Habbibi's ruling Golkar party received 20 percent of the vote. The

IV-29
allocation of seats is still to be decided, and the election of a new president by a
supplemented parliament is scheduled to take place in November.

Hong Kong's economy remains weak with consumer prices continuing to fall
sharply, although some signs of a pickup in economic activity have recently
emerged. The unemployment rate fell to 6 percent in the May-July period, down
from a peak of 6.3 percent in the March-May period. The merchandise trade
deficit widened in June from May, largely due to a rebound in imports which
outpaced improving exports. Spreads between one-year Hong Kong government
debt and U.S. Treasuries were around 73 basis points on August 18, roughly
unchanged since mid-May, but nevertheless down sharply from their levels of
nearly 280 basis points in January.

In China, rumors of a possible devaluation of the renminbi have resurfaced as
recent data confirm that economic activity is slowing sharply. In the second
quarter, seasonally adjusted real GDP was almost flat. Moderate deflation
continues, reflecting weak private demand. Despite growing exports, China's
trade surplus narrowed sharply in the first half of 1999, although it widened
again in July. The growth in exports reflects an improvement in other Asian
economies and the impact of government measures to expand exports. Imports,
which had soared earlier in the year largely as a result of a successful anti-
smuggling campaign, appear to have stabilized.

Standard & Poor lowered the long-term foreign currency sovereign and senior
unsecured ratings for China to BBB from BBB-plus and the short-term foreign
currency credit rating to A-3 from A-2. The agency said that the downgrade

reflected "lower trend growth prospects and rising fiscal costs of economic
reform."
In Taiwan, the economy continues to strengthen with industrial production
growing strongly in the second quarter. The unemployment rate was 2.9 percent
in June, roughly unchanged from the beginning of the year. Deflation resumed
in June with consumer prices falling from their year-earlier level, after a slight
rise in prices in May. Taiwan's trade surplus narrowed sharply in June and July,
albeit from elevated levels, as soaring imports managed to outpace rapidly
growing exports. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rose to US$99 billion at
the end of July, the highest level since July 1995. Stock prices in Taiwan have
fallen sharply since mid-July, reflecting heightened political tensions between
China and Taiwan.

Russia is far from being in good economic shape by any international standard,
but the recent agreement on a modified IMF program and above-average second-
quarter economic performance provide some grounds for limited optimism.
Second-quarter economic activity outperformed all expectations: industrial
production rose above pre-crisis levels, higher tax revenues and rising world oil
prices pushed the primary budget balance into surplus, the labor market has
stabilized, and consumer price index inflation declined to a low of 1.9 percent
(month-on-month) in June.

On July 28, the IMF approved the release of $4.5 billion to Russia to be
disbursed in seven $640 million loan installments. The approved funds are to be
used exclusively for financing repayments of previous IMF loans, thereby
keeping Russia current with the IMF and avoiding a further deterioration of its
international financial relations. Immediately after the approval, Paris Club
country creditors agreed to reschedule $8 billion in Soviet-era bilateral debt due
this year and next, to be repaid over the next 15-20 years.
President Yelstin fired yet another cabinet on August 9, replacing Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin with Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federal Security
Agency. Since it is highly probable that current Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov and his financial team will be retained, the economic consequences of
the cabinet shuffle are unlikely to be serious. Potential financial repercussions
include possible delays in negotiations with London Club commercial creditors
and delays in future World Bank loans as required legislative reforms in the
Duma are further sidetracked by the process of confirming Putin as Prime
Minister.
