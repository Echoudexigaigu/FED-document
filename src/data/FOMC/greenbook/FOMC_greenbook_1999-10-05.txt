DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Recent data have reaffirmed the strong uptrend in U.S. economic activity.
Payrolls have risen rapidly, and the growth in aggregate hours worked has
picked up. Although residential construction may have topped out, expenditures
on producers' durable equipment and personal consumption expenditures
continue to provide substantial impetus to growth in domestic spending. At the
same time, although prices of oil and a variety of other industrial commodities
have continued to post significant increases, "core" consumer inflation has
remained modest.
Labor Market Developments
Private nonfarm payrolls rose an average of 182,000 a month in July and
August, about in line with the average monthly gains during the first half of the
year. Job gains in the private services-producing sector remained robust through
August, but goods-producing payrolls were held down by a 63,000 drop in
manufacturing employment that more than reversed July's surprising uptick.
Averaging through the recent fluctuations, employment losses in manufacturing
appear to have moderated of late, with sizable losses in the first half of the year
giving way to declines averaging a more modest 6,000 per month in July and
August. Employment in the construction sector seems to be decelerating; the
number of construction jobs fell 29,000 in August after gains in June and July
that were somewhat smaller than those recorded earlier this year.
Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls edged up 0.1 hour in August to 34.6 hours. The index of hours
of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.1 percent; cumulating this slight
increase with some substantial gains in earlier months, this series stands
0.8 percent above the second-quarter average (not at an annual rate). And with
hours worked by the self-employed also up sharply in August, hours in the
nonfarm business sector as a whole appear to have risen faster this quarter than
during the first half of this year.
Data from the household survey continue to portray an exceptionally tight labor
market. The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.2 percent in August, the
low end of the range for this year. The share of the population out of the labor
force but wanting a job fell further, returning this series to near its historical low,
and the number of job leavers who were unemployed for less than five weeks (as
a percentage of household employment) remained at a very high level despite a
decline in August. Other labor market indicators support the same impression of
tightness; for example, the four-week moving average of initial claims for
unemployment insurance has been running near its twenty-five-year low.

The labor force participation rate edged down to 66.9 percent in August, a
twelve-month low. However, the bulk of the drop came from a decline in the
participation rate of teenagers, an erratic series that is particularly difficult to
seasonally adjust. Other major demographic groups showed unchanged or
increased participation rates. The overall participation rate has backed off from
its peak of 67.3 percent recorded in the first quarter and currently stands at a
level slightly below its average over the past year.
Among other labor market indicators, the Conference Board's consumer survey
shows that workers continue to perceive job opportunities as very plentiful.
Information on the views of firms leads to the same general conclusion: Recent
surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the
Bureau of National Affairs show that although difficulties in filling open
positions may have eased a bit recently, the proportion of firms reporting
difficulties remains very high.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.3 percent in August after jumping 0.7 percent in
July. With the August level now 1-1/4 percent (not at an annual rate) above the
second-quarter average, production is poised to post a second consecutive
quarter of solid growth.
The output of utilities declined 1.6 percent in August, reflecting a retreat from
July's heat-related surge in demand, but the output of mines rose markedly for a
second month, largely on the strength of increases in oil and gas drilling and
coal production. In manufacturing, production grew 0.4 percent owing to
continued advances in "high-tech" industry output and robust motor vehicle
assemblies. The increase in manufacturing production in August raised the
factory operating rate to 79.8 percent, but the rate remained well below its long-
term average.
Within manufacturing, durable goods production advanced 0.7 percent in
August. Output of motor vehicles and parts jumped with Ford's recovery from
parts-shortage problems in July, adding to the impetus from the blockbuster pace
of sales in August. Production schedules for the rest of the year call for
assemblies to decrease a bit but to remain at very high levels. In light of current
low levels of inventories and ongoing strength in sales, our industry contacts
hint at the possibility that production plans for coming months may be increased.
Excluding motor vehicles, production in the three major high-technology
industries--computers, semiconductors, and communications equipment--has
provided most of the gains in recent months. The output of nondurable
industries has softened, on net, in recent months.

Turning to market groups, consumer goods production climbed 0.8 percent in
August with continuing strength in the output of durable goods and, especially,
the remarkable pace of production of automotive products. Materials
production in August increased 0.3 percent; much of the strength in this
category in recent months has been concentrated in semiconductors and steel.
And while the output of construction supplies fell 0.6 percent in August, the
level of production has remained high since early this year, with some erratic
month-to-month changes recently.
Production of business equipment grew 0.2 percent last month after a 0.9
percent climb in July. Information processing equipment (including
communications equipment)--which rose 0.7 percent in August and 17.6 percent
over the past year--continues to be the dominant source of growth in business
equipment production. Output in the other equipment categories has remained
weak in recent months. In the aircraft sector--as shown in the accompanying
figure--completions of commercial aircraft at Boeing rose strongly through late
last year but have been dropping back more recently; Boeing expects further
declines in completions through the end of next year. Production of capital
goods excluding high-technology products and transportation equipment has
been softening since early 1998. As of the second quarter, the exports of these
goods still were below their levels of a year earlier, although the rate of decline
had eased considerably on a year-to-year basis.
New orders for durable goods have been strong of late. The staffs estimate of
real adjusted durable goods orders in July and August is 5-1/2 percent above the
average for the second quarter (not at an annual rate). The new orders index

Motor Vehicles
Light vehicle sales, adjusted for shifts in automakers' reporting periods, soared
to a 17.8 million unit annual rate in August, more than a million units above the
already strong pace in July. A huge spike in fleet purchases, particularly from
GM and Ford, more than accounted for the increase.' Retail sales of motor
vehicles were little changed but remained extremely high. Our industry
contacts report that they expect fleet sales to return to more normal levels in
September; however, automakers are not expecting much cooling in the red-hot
pace of consumer demand.
Buying conditions for motor vehicles have remained very favorable. Although
the Michigan Survey Research Center's index of consumer perceptions of car-
buying conditions has dropped a bit in recent months, the level is still quite high
by historical standards. These positive assessments are likely based on the near-

absence of increases in new car sticker prices of late and the offer of sizable
incentives by manufacturers. Indeed, the CPI for new vehicles edged down in
August, owing to incentives and model-year close-out sales; over the past year,
the new-vehicle CPI has fallen almost a percentage point. Through July,
increases in interest rates had not had an appreciable effect on net auto financing
rates--a sizable proportion of new-vehicle acquisitions are obtained under
special finance or lease rates that have been subsidized by captive finance
companies as part of incentive programs.
Demand for trucks has also been exceptionally robust. In August, medium and
heavy truck sales reached 640,000 units at an annual rate, above even the
already-high 628,000 average rate posted in the first half of the year. So far this
year, sales of medium and heavy trucks have been 27 percent higher than in the
comparable period of 1998. Data for August on new orders for medium and
heavy trucks, combined with the already high levels of backlogs, suggest that
sales will remain strong in the near term.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Consumer spending continues to be a major source of economic strength despite
some deceleration from the torrid pace posted in the first half of the year. In the
retail sales report for August, nominal expenditures for goods in the retail
control category increased 0.6 percent after a gain of 0.4 percent in July. Sales
increases were spread across all major components. Apparel outlays jumped
1-1/4 percent in August, a gain consistent with anecdotal reports of strong
demand for back-to-school clothing. Nominal purchases at gasoline stations
rose about 2 percent, and although a good deal of this increase undoubtedly
reflects a steep rise in gasoline prices, physical product data from the
Department of Energy indicate that real gasoline consumption also rose in
August. Real PCE for motor vehicles also is likely to have increased in August.
In sum, we estimate that spending on all goods grew 0.4 percent in real terms
during the month, a gain that puts the average level of real goods expenditures
in July and August about 1 percent above the second-quarter average.
Real expenditures on services rose 0.4 percent in July, the most recent month for
which data are available. This increase reflects, in part, a jump in electricity
outlays due to unseasonably warm weather; based on subsequent weather data,
demand for electricity likely fell back in August and was little changed in
September. Spending on recreational services posted a robust gain in July, and
outlays for medical, personal care, and personal business services also rose.
Real disposable personal income edged down 0.1 percent in July, owing to a
decline in federal disaster aid to farmers that had boosted income growth in
June. However, wage and salary disbursements were up substantially in July,

and, in light of the increases in production worker hours and wages last month,
they appear poised to post a moderate gain in August.
The personal saving rate was -1.4 percent in July, little changed from the
second-quarter average, but about 1-3/4 percentage points below the rate of a
year ago. With the broadest indexes of stock prices reaching new highs in July,
consumers overall apparently saw little reason to save out of current income.
The more recent retreat in stock market valuation has reduced household wealth
and pushed the ratio of wealth to income down somewhat.
Consumer sentiment in September as measured by the preliminary Michigan
survey was up a little from August and at the top of the high range that has
prevailed since the spring of 1997. Respondents were particularly upbeat about
future business conditions, and assessments of buying conditions for large
household appliances also improved. The Conference Board index edged down
for a third consecutive month in September, but its level also remained high.
Views of the respondents to the Conference Board's questions on present
conditions were little changed. However, assessments of future business
conditions, job prospects, and income gains all softened. Cut-off dates for both
the preliminary Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey were around
the middle of September; therefore, neither survey could have picked up any
shift in sentiment in response to the more recent decline in stock prices.
A large proportion of respondents in the most recent Michigan survey--and a
considerably larger share than was the case six months ago--reported that they
expect interest rates to increase over the next year. Their appraisals of buying
conditions for homes (which are not a component of the overall index) were the
most pessimistic in more than four years, reflecting the recent run-up in
mortgage rates. Similarly, in the Conference Board survey the proportion of
households expecting increases in interest rates has been running at an
appreciably higher level in recent months.
The current high levels of the two indexes of consumer sentiment do not suggest
that households harbor much anxiety about the millennium change, although
neither the regular Michigan survey nor the Conference Board survey
specifically tracks consumers' views regarding anticipated Y2K problems.
Opinion polls that have been directed to this topic have yielded decidedly mixed
results. For example, in December 1998, more than a third of respondents to a
poll conducted by Gallup in partnership with the National Science Foundation
and USA Today felt that the millennium bug would cause "major problems," but
by August of this year, this share had dropped to 11 percent. About half of the
respondents to the August survey had no plans to take any precautionary steps.
At the same time, however, 36 percent of Gallup respondents said that they

in December.
Housing Markets
Housing construction remained strong, on balance, into late summer but with
some indications of deceleration. Single-family starts declined in August but
only slightly, and the level--1.30 million units at an annual rate--remained high.
Adjusted single-family permits fell a bit more than starts, leaving the ratio of
starts to permits slightly above its long-run average. A high ratio of starts to
permits is often a harbinger of some slippage in starts going forward; however,
the number of single-family permits previously issued but still unused was at a
nine-year high in August. In addition, the inventory of unsold homes remains
quite low. These indicators suggest continuing support for high levels of single-
family construction in the near future.
Recent data provide conflicting signals about whether higher mortgage rates
have affected sales of single-family houses. On the one hand, new home sales
edged up to 980,000 units at an annual rate in July, the second-highest level on
record; on the other hand, existing home sales for August slid 2-3/4 percent, to
5.25 million units at an annual rate. While existing home sales are now nearly
7 percent below their record high posted in June, the August level still ranks as
the fifth highest ever.2 Rising mortgage rates appear to be leaving a clearer
imprint on survey data and mortgage applications. As noted above, consumer
attitudes toward homebuying turned much less positive in both August and
September, and higher mortgage rates were specifically reported as the main
factor underlying this shift. Also, the MBA index of purchase applications for
home mortgages has declined noticeably since late June.
Homebuilders continue to complain of severe shortages of labor and materials.
According to a survey conducted earlier this month by the National Association
of Home Builders, shortages of wallboard, insulation materials, brick, and labor
have remained severe and in some cases have worsened (see table). Recent
price data have provided mixed support for builders' views: The PPI for gypsum
wallboard posted another large gain in August, raising it to a level about
20 percent above that of a year earlier. Lumber and plywood prices, however,
have dropped back significantly from the stratospheric levels of a couple of
months ago, although they remain high by historical standards.
2. This pattern of improvement in July new home sales and deterioration in August of
existing home sales is somewhat unusual in that the former usually respond to changing
economic circumstances more rapidly than the latter: New home sales are recorded when a
contract is signed or a deposit is accepted, whereas most existing home sales are tallied as of the
closing date of the sale.

Broader measures of construction costs show only modest price pressures. For
example, the PPI for intermediate materials and components rose just 2 percent
over the twelve months ended in August after holding flat over the previous
twelve-month period, and the average hourly earnings of construction workers
have risen only moderately over the past twelve months--a touch less than
3 percent. The last ECI showed hourly compensation of construction workers
up slightly more than 3 percent over the twelve months ended in June. However,
coverage of these series extends across all types of construction, not just
homebuilding, and therefore may underestimate the cost increases that
homebuilders have been experiencing.
In view of the strength of sales, builders might be expected to find it relatively
easy to pass on cost increases to homebuyers in the form of higher prices. In the
second quarter, quality-adjusted prices of new homes were up 4.6 percent from
the level of a year earlier, a deceleration from the year-to-year rise reported in
the first quarter but otherwise the fastest in several years.
Business Fixed Investment
Producers' durable equipment. Real expenditures on producers' durable
equipment appear to have posted another impressive gain in the third quarter,
bolstered by outlays for high-tech machinery and transportation equipment.
Nominal shipments of office and computing equipment surged in July and
dropped back only a little in August (the industry detail on orders and shipments
is confidential), and the prices of computing equipment have maintained a steep
downward trend. These developments suggest that the third-quarter gain in real
computer outlays could be very large indeed. Last-minute attempts of some
firms to get new systems in place before the end of the year might explain some
of the jump in shipments. But declining prices and a widening range of

applications for computers are continuing to provide strong motivation for
businesses to invest. A notable example of recent price attractiveness is Sun
Microsystems's offer of generous discounts to customers who are willing to
trade in non-Sun equipment before the new millennium.3
The factors underlying the recent strength in domestic communications
equipment spending--falling prices, a rising importance of networking
equipment, and ongoing telecommunications deregulation--have not abated, and
this sector will likely post another sizable gain in the third quarter. Still, growth
in real outlays on communications equipment is unlikely to repeat last quarter's
advance of nearly 50 percent at an annual rate. Nominal shipments of
communications equipment by domestic producers have remained on a strong
uptrend this quarter, but imports of communications equipment fell
4-1/2 percent in July after an unusually large second-quarter gain.
Indicators of transportation equipment spending for the third quarter are also
upbeat. After increasing moderately in the second quarter, business
expenditures on aircraft are poised to record a substantial gain in the third
quarter. Boeing reports strong shipments in August, despite cutbacks in
production, and deliveries to domestic carriers are likely to be further bolstered
this quarter by stepped-up purchases from Airbus. In the other major
transportation categories the news is equally rosy. As noted above, a
disproportionate share ofAugust's motor vehicle sales ended up in fleet sales to
businesses, and demand for medium and heavy trucks continued at high levels
over the summer.
Excluding the high-tech and transportation sectors, real expenditures for
equipment appear to have picked up a little in the third quarter after posting
relatively sluggish gains in the first half of the year. Nominal shipments in this
category in August were 3-1/4 percent above the second-quarter average.
Moreover, new orders for these goods, after having fallen 12-1/2 percent over
the first half of the year, bounced back in July and August and no longer trail
shipments.
3. We cannot rule out the possibility that a disproportionately large share of computer
shipments has ended up in the hands of consumers this quarter. Compuserve has announced
sharply higher membership rates owing to the success of its offer of $400 rebates to personal
computer purchasers who agree to three years of Internet service. In addition, reports in the
Beige Book and elsewhere suggest that back-to-school sales of computers have been good. The
BEA, however, will not diverge from the normal allocation between PDE and PCE that they
apply to computer sales unless evidence to the contrary is overwhelming. Whatever the
allocation, the surge in shipments of computers should show up as increased real GDP.

Nonresidential structures. Real investment in nonresidential construction
declined at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, and the
available third-quarter indicators point to persistent sluggishness. Nominal
expenditures on buildings put in place changed little in July and were
0.4 percent below the average for the second quarter. The recent pattern of
steep declines in the construction of industrial facilities resumed in July, and
expenditures for other commercial structures--which include retail properties
and warehouses--fell moderately. On the positive side, office construction
posted a respectable gain in July, and investment in hotel and motel properties
turned up. Construction of institutional structures--which include religious
and educational buildings and hospitals--was about unchanged.
Overall, contracts for nonresidential construction continued to decline in
August. Construction contracts for industrial buildings rose noticeably, but in
light of ample manufacturing capacity, this development probably is just a
temporary blip in statistically noisy data. Contracts for office buildings and
for other commercial structures also declined in August, continuing
established downtrends in both series. Although vacancy rates for offices in
downtown locations remained quite low at midyear, they no longer are
trending down, and vacancy rates for suburban offices have risen a bit.
Furthermore, increases in office property values have moderated noticeably so
far this year. In other sectors, the rate of increase in property values for
warehouses has changed little, on balance, over the past two years, while the
value of retail properties has decelerated substantially over this period.
Business Inventories
After posting only a small gain in the second quarter, investment in business
inventories rose sharply in July. For manufacturing and trade excluding motor
vehicles, the book value of inventories increased at a $46 billion annual rate, up
from a $13 billion pace in the second quarter. Following liquidations in each of
the previous three quarters, the book value of manufacturers' inventories
accumulated at a $26 billion annual pace in July; part of the step-up likely
reflected rising petroleum prices. Stockbuilding at wholesalers (excluding
motor vehicle distributors) also picked up in July, registering a $27 billion
(annual rate) increase. In contrast, retailers (excluding auto dealerships) reduced
stocks at a $7 billion pace. Inventories are low relative to sales in the
manufacturing and retail sectors, and much of last year's run-up in the ratio for
the wholesale trade sector has been reversed.
Inventory-to-sales ratios, outside of motor vehicles, have come down markedly
in a large number of sectors since the turn of the year. In many sectors, the
falling ratios appear to reflect ongoing efforts to streamline inventory systems.
For example, the stock-to-sales ratios of manufacturers of machinery,

instruments, tobacco, fabricated metals, transportation equipment, and stone,
clay, and glass products, as well as general merchandisers and furniture retailers,
have exhibited steady downtrends for most of the decade. So far this year, the
decrease in inventories relative to sales in these industries--which account for
about 30 percent of the total sales for the manufacturing and trade sector
(excluding automotive products)--has been in line with their long-term
downward trends.
In some other industries, this year's falling inventory-sales ratios followed a
marked run-up in the ratios that coincided with the weakening demand from
abroad and heightened competition from imports that occurred during late 1997
and 1998. Among these industries, which collectively represent about
20 percent of the sales in the broader aggregate, manufacturers and distributors
of chemicals and of metals and minerals, producers of paper and of leather,
wholesalers of electrical equipment and of hardware, professional and
commercial equipment jobbers, and apparel retailers all have managed to bring
their stock-to-sales ratios down from last year's elevated levels. Still, in some
cases--namely in the chemicals, metals, and wholesale machinery sectors--
further reductions appear to be necessary to bring inventory-sales ratios back in
line with the levels that generally prevailed a couple of years ago.
Among the remaining industries, the overall ratio of inventories to sales moved
up slightly in 1997 and 1998 and down slightly in 1999. Much of this decline
owed to a sharp drop in stock-to-sales ratios at petroleum refiners and
distributors, where the run-up in crude oil prices and the deteriorating margins
have made it more costly to hold inventories. Inventory-to-sales ratios in the
remaining industries, representing about half of the sales of the sector, have
been flat over the past two years: The current level of inventories does not look
out of line with shipments and sales, and stockbuilding has proceeded at a
steady, modest pace.
Government Expenditures
Federal. The federal government posted a unified deficit of $28 billion during
July and August, down about $8 billion from the same period a year earlier.
Adjusted federal outlays for July and August were up just 3 percent from last
year's level. This modest growth owes primarily to declines in net interest and
Medicare expenditures and continued very slow growth in the cyclically
sensitive income security category. Spending restraint in these areas partially
offset the increases in Medicaid, other health programs, defense, and the "other"
category--primarily nondefense discretionary spending.

Receipts in July and August were about 7 percent higher than last year's level.
This rise reflects the robust growth of withheld income and payroll taxes that is
related primarily to the growth of nominal wages and salaries. September is
important for receipts because individuals and corporations are required to make
their quarterly estimated tax payments by the fifteenth day of the month.
Preliminary data reported in the Daily Treasury Statement indicate that Treasury
fared well on the fifteenth and that receipts for the month likely will be up about
10 percent compared to September of 1998. This gain places the federal
government on track for a sizable surplus in September and a total surplus in the
$118 billion to $128 billion range for fiscal 1999.
The congressional appropriations process that will fund discretionary spending
programs in fiscal 2000 remains far from complete. As of September 28,
Congress had sent the President four of the thirteen regular appropriations bills,
and the President has signed one of these and vetoed one. Congressional
versions of most other bills are nearing completion, but several of these face
presidential veto threats.4 Therefore, Congress has enacted a three-week
continuing resolution that provides temporary funding to programs whose
regular appropriation has not been enacted. In this time period, Congress and
the Administration will have to reconcile significant differences in spending
priorities, and also reconcile the appropriations bills with the discretionary
spending caps and promises to not spend any of the social security surplus. This
likely will be a formidable task because the CBO and the Democratic staff of
the House Budget Committee claim that congressional action to date would
reduce the CBO baseline surplus projection about $40 billion (this would cut the
projected social security surplus about $25 billion).
State and local. Employment gains in the state and local government sector
averaged almost 52,000 in July and August, nearly double the 28,000 average
over the first half of the year. However, much of the strength this quarter stems
from increases in local education and may reflect difficulties with seasonal
adjustment during the volatile summer months. Meanwhile, real state-and-local
expenditures on construction edged down in July, with a large drop in the
education component. Real outlays on highway construction, which had surged
in the first quarter and fallen back in the spring, jumped 2 percent in July to a
level comparable to the fourth-quarter average.
Some of the fiscal good news among the states reflects the steady decline of
welfare caseloads from their peak in 1994 (see chart). By March 1999--the last
4. The House and Senate have passed different versions of eight other bills; the differences
are being reconciled in conference.

month for which data are available--caseloads stood at their lowest level in
thirty years. Indeed, states have not needed to use all of their federal grants:
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families for the period from federal fiscal year
1997 through the first quarter of 1999 were $4.2 billion, about 12 percent of the
total federal TANF funds awarded so far. Current law states that these funds
will remain available for obligation until drawn on by the states.
Prices and Labor Costs
Prices. Outside of the energy sector, inflation has remained subdued. The
overall CPI rose 0.3 percent in August but only 0.1 percent excluding food and
energy. Over the most recent twelve months, the headline CPI has accelerated
to 2.3 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous twelve-month period owing to
the sharp rebound in energy prices; the core CPI has risen just 1.9 percent, down
from the 2.5 percent increase of a year earlier.5
The jump in CPI energy prices in August was the second in a row and reflected
the pass-through of higher crude petroleum costs into motor fuel and home
heating oil. Since the end of last year, gasoline prices have climbed about
23 percent (not at an annual rate) after having fallen more than 15 percent in
1998. The latest survey data suggest that retail prices for gasoline rose further
in September. In August, natural gas prices posted a large increase for the third
consecutive month. Food prices, on the other hand, have remained more or less
in check, rising 0.2 percent in each of the past two months. Since August of last
year, food prices have increased 2.0 percent, about in line with the core CPI.
Prices of some farm commodities moved up a little following the damage
wrought by hurricane Floyd; overall, however, agricultural futures prices are
lower than they were at the time the August Greenbook was published.
The CPI for commodities other than food and energy edged down 0.1 percent
in August and has risen only 0.2 percent over the past twelve months.
Computer prices fell 3.8 percent--the largest monthly decline since January.
New and used car prices continued to move in opposite directions: After
ticking down in August, prices for new motor vehicles are now down
0.6 percent since the beginning of the year; in contrast, used car prices posted
their fifth consecutive sizable increase in August. Tobacco prices fell
5. Changes in methodology introduced in January have held down the increase in the CPI,
thus exaggerating the deceleration in the core CPI. On a consistently measured basis using
current methodology, the core CPI increased 1.9 percent in the most recent twelve months,
down from the 2.2 percent increase in the twelve months ended in August 1998.

1.3 percent in August, reversing some of the July increase. We expect to see
the first effects of the recent hike in wholesale cigarette prices in the
September CPI report.6 However, some reports have suggested that the
tobacco companies might temper the initial impact of these price increases on
consumers by offering coupons and other forms of discounting, implying that
the adjustment could be spread across several months. On net, we would
expect these tobacco price increases to boost both the core and total CPI
indexes by about a tenth.
Prices of services excluding energy moved up 0.2 percent in August after
having increased 0.3 percent in July. Owners' equivalent rent rose
0.2 percent last month, continuing the string of small increases seen so far this
year. Through the first eight months of the year, owners' equivalent rent has
increased 2.2 percent at an annual rate, down from the 3.2 percent rate of rise
posted for all of 1998.7 Among other key components, airfares fell
2.7 percent last month, following July's 6.5 percent increase; even with only a
small weight, the month-to-month swing in this component accounted for the
tick down in the broader services (excluding energy) category. For the twelve
months ended in August, prices of non-energy services rose 2.6 percent, down
from 3.1 percent in the previous twelve-month period; about half of this
deceleration can be accounted for by the slowdown in owners' equivalent rent.
For capital goods, the PPI was unchanged in August after two months of
declines. Producer prices of computers plunged 3-1/4 percent last month after
having dropped only 1-1/4 percent per month, on average, in June and July. In
the year to date, computer prices have fallen 24 percent at an annual rate, just a
little less rapidly than the average in 1998. Finally, the producer price indexes
for new cars and light trucks were both down again in August, and prices of
communications equipment held about steady for the two months following
June's sharp decrease.
6. Major tobacco companies raised wholesale cigarette prices 18 cents per pack as of
September 1. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, 10 cents per pack can be attributed to the
rise in federal excise taxes scheduled for January 1, 2000, and 4 cents covers additional costs
related to the tobacco settlement. The remaining 4 cents, according to the Journal article, is a
reflection of the normal uptrend in prices. The increase was supposedly timed to prevent
wholesalers from stocking up ahead of the increase in the excise taxes.
7. The small increases in owners' equivalent rent stand in contrast to the increases in house
prices. BLS analysts say that there is no obvious reason why the new sample of households and
weighting change, introduced in January of this year should have held down the published price
increases. The index for rent of primary residence--which was also affected by the change in the
sample of households but not by the change in weighting--has also decelerated. In any case, the
relationship between owners' equivalent rent and house prices has never been a particularly tight
one.

The quiescence of prices at the final goods level contrasts with a less favorable
trend in prices at earlier stages of processing. Prices of PPI core intermediate
materials moved up again in August, albeit at a more moderate pace than in the
previous two months; over the past six months, these prices have increased at a
3 percent annual rate after having dropped 1.7 percent in the prior twelve
months. Some of the recent rise reflects increases in the prices of some
chemicals and plastics--both of which use petroleum heavily in their production.
Still further back in the production chain, core materials prices at the crude
level were up substantially again in August and have climbed 9-1/2 percent at an
annual rate since the beginning of the year after having dropped 16 percent in
1998.
In the SRC survey of households, median expectations of inflation over the next
twelve months came in at 2.7 percent for the third quarter, about unchanged
from the average for the second quarter. Over the longer term, respondents
expect a bit higher inflation: The average of third-quarter readings on median
expectations for the next five to ten years was 2.9 percent, up about a tenth from
the second quarter.
Labor costs. We have received only a few bits of information on labor costs
since the last Greenbook, and they have provided mixed signals. Average
hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls
rose 0.2 percent in August, as wage gains in services and wholesale and retail
trade were partially offset by declines in most other major sectors. Average
hourly earnings advanced 3.5 percent over the year ended August 1999, down
from the 4.2 percent gain for the previous twelve months.
In contrast to the overall AHE data, wage increases from union settlements
have shown some acceleration in 1999. The Bureau of National Affairs
reported that first-year wage increases for all union settlements averaged
3.4 percent during the first thirty-eight weeks of 1999, up from 2.9 percent
during the same period last year. Although these data do include the
settlement reached between Boeing and its union, they do not include the
recent generous settlements in the auto industry. Boeing and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to wage increases of
4 percent in each of the first two years of their contract and 3 percent in the
third. This was in addition to a $4,400 average lump-sum payment, an
increase in the hourly shift differential, and cost-of-living wage adjustments.
On September 16, DaimlerChrysler and the UAW reached a tentative
agreement that extends for four years instead of the traditional three years.
The contract includes annual wage increases of 3 percent--on top of cost-of-
living adjustments that will provide almost full indexation to the CPI-W--plus
a signing bonus of $1,350. General Motors and the UAW reached tentative

II-40
agreement on September 28 on a settlement that reportedly is quite similar to
the DaimlerChrysler contract. Negotiations involving Ford are expected to be
stickier because of the company's announced intention to spin off parts plants
outside of existing bargaining units.
On the benefits side, we have no new information on the private sector.
However, the Office of Personnel Management recently announced that
premiums for participants in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan will
increase 10 percent in 2000, on average, assuming no change in enrollments,
and 9.3 percent taking account of anticipated changes in enrollment patterns.
This will be the third consecutive large increase in FEHBP health costs. OPM
cites rapidly rising costs for prescription drugs as one factor driving the
substantial increases. For much of the 1990s, FEHBP increases were broadly
similar to those indicated by the health insurance component of the ECI for
private-sector workers. In the past couple of years, however, premiums have
risen considerably faster than the ECI health component. The OPM
announcement, together with the sizable increases in health insurance costs for
the year 2000 announced by CALPERS last May, may be seen as pointing
toward rising health insurance costs in the private sector.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Market reaction to the System's 25 basis point tightening and the symmetric
directive in August was limited since these actions were largely expected. For
much of the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury yields fluctuated in a
narrow range, as incoming data pointing to unexpected strength in the U.S.
economy and indicating a pickup abroad were counterbalanced by signs that
retail price inflation was under control. In late September, however, yields
swung more widely, partly in response to shifting sentiment on the equity
market. Since the August meeting, Treasury yields have changed little, on net, at
intermediate maturities and have risen about 10 basis points at the long end.
Futures markets, which had never assigned much probability to a tightening at
the October FOMC meeting, also foresee very low odds of a rate hike in
November.
Yield spreads on investment-grade corporate debt have edged higher, but junk
bond spreads have risen more substantially, reflecting concerns about
prospective defaults. Most of the broad indexes of equity prices have posted
sizable declines over the intermeeting period, with the Wilshire 5000 down more
than 5 percent; at times the price declines seemed linked to concerns about a
reallocation of portfolios away from the U.S. market.
Since the August FOMC meeting, concerns about liquidity in financial markets
at year-end and supply congestion in advance of the century date change have
eased slightly, but many gauges of Y2K pressures on financial markets remain
elevated. Special measures announced by the Desk and speeches by Federal
Reserve System officials reassured market participants that the central bank
stood ready to manage the century date change smoothly. Substantial
uncertainty about the year-end remains, however, particularly about whether
trading activity will slow and liquidity will dry up because of a reluctance to take
on risk.
Available data for the third quarter indicate that private nonfinancial sectors
have been adding debt at about the same fairly brisk rate as last quarter. Overall
corporate debt growth has remained strong, with some firms that encountered
tepid demand in the bond market borrowing instead from banks. Growth in
home mortgage debt also has remained solid despite the sharp decline in
refinancing activity, and growth in consumer credit has strengthened.
Municipal debt has grown moderately, while the federal government has
continued to pay down debt.
Liquidity and Year-End Concerns
Interest rate spreads over Treasuries have narrowed in many--but certainly not
all--markets during the intermeeting period. However, even in those markets

where spreads have come down, they have not fully retraced the rise during the
summer and remain well above their levels before the disruptions of last fall.
On September 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced several
measures to address year-end pressures: The temporary expansion of acceptable
RP collateral to include mortgage-backed securities, authorization to enter into
RPs with maturities up to ninety days, and a temporary Stand-by Financing
Facility under which options on RP transactions would be auctioned. After the
announcement, the one-month December libor futures rate dropped about
25 basis points. However, nearly all of that decline has since been retraced.
Similarly, the butterfly spread on libor futures--which compares the rate on the
December contract with the average of rates on the surrounding contracts--has
reversed the entire decline that followed the September 8 announcement.
Moreover, the premium in the commercial paper market for funding over year-
end continues to be elevated, about matching year-end premiums seen during the
financial market disruptions last October. All of this suggests that lenders are
still quite wary of committing unsecured funds at year-end.
Despite the continued concern about potential year-end difficulties, spreads on
interest rate swaps have narrowed since the August FOMC meeting. These
spreads have fallen, in part, because market participants have revised down their
expectation for the volume of near-term bond issuance, which has tempered the
demand for swaps as a hedge against the risk of a rise in bond yields. In
addition, on the supply side, counterparties willing to receive fixed-rate
payments have come back into the swaps market, which has improved liquidity
and narrowed spreads.
Swap contracts typically entail very little credit risk, and the spreads on most
other highly-rated instruments--including agency, mortgage-backed, and asset-
backed securities--have moved down with swaps. However, spreads for lower-
rated securities have not declined. Indeed, as noted above, junk bond spreads
actually have widened a fair bit since the August FOMC meeting.
Business Finance
Net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses in the third quarter has been similar to
the second-quarter pace, but higher interest rates, especially on lower-rated
corporate bonds, have shifted funding away from bonds and toward bank loans.
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations in August and September
came in somewhat below the pace in the first half of this year, falling well short
of market expectations. Investment-grade bond offerings were buoyed by a
number of multibillion dollar deals, but investors remain reluctant to purchase
smaller, less liquid issues. Speculative-grade issuance dropped sharply, as yields
on these bonds widened on investor anxiety about potential defaults; reflecting

these concerns, junk-bond mutual funds experienced net outflows in August and
the first half of September. At least part of the expected surge in issuance may
only have been postponed, however, because a growing issuance calendar points
to heavy offerings in the weeks ahead as firms act to complete their funding
ahead of year-end.
Short- and intermediate-term business credit strengthened in the third quarter.
Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding rose steadily until mid-September,
when some issuers used the proceeds of bond issues to pay down their paper.
Business loan growth was robust in August and September. Many borrowers
found banks to be a more attractive source of credit than the bond market and
tapped their committed lines of credit even in the face of a continued firming of
loan pricing and other terms. According to the August Survey of Terms of
Business Lending, the proportion of loans made under commitment rose sharply,
nearly reaching its recent peak when bond market financing almost shut down in
the fourth quarter of 1998. The survey also showed that the average spread over
the intended federal funds rate for loans made at domestic banks rose 7 basis
points between the May and August surveys, bringing the cumulative rise so far
this year to about 1/4 percentage point. The proportion of loans backed by
collateral increased for the third consecutive quarter.
Indicators of business credit quality have been mixed. Junk bond defaults for
the twelve months ended in August were higher than for any other year since
1991, and a further rise is likely in part because of the aging of bonds issued
over the past two years. Business failures have continued to run above the pace
of recent years, although they have slowed a bit lately. On the plus side, bonds
ofnonfinancial firms have been upgraded, on net, in the third quarter, and the
dollar volume of debt on review for upgrades exceeds that for downgrades.
Gross equity issuance slowed in August from the torrid July rate, to about the
average pace of last year. The cooler market reception in August and early
September for new shares, particularly for Internet-related firms, was short-
lived, however, as issuance rebounded late in the month. Meanwhile, equity at
nonfinancial firms continued to be retired at a rapid pace, as merger and
acquisition activity showed little sign of slowing. An estimated $110 billion of
deals closed in the third quarter, and almost a third of that amount was financed
with cash. Announcements of share repurchases, however, dropped to an
estimated $15 billion in the third quarter, about half the pace of recent years.
The rise in corporate bond yields this year has increased the cost of borrowing to
fund capital expenditures, which may have induced firms to earmark more of
their profits for investment rather than returning them to shareholders via
repurchases.

The DJIA and S&P 500 have fallen about 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively,
since the last FOMC meeting, partly on concerns about a reallocation of investor
portfolios away from U.S. and toward foreign markets. The Nasdaq hit a new
high during the intermeeting period but then retreated with the broader market,
including a large, one-day drop in late September on comments by Microsoft's
president that technology stocks were overvalued. On balance, the Nasdaq has
edged up since the last FOMC meeting. Equity valuations continue to look rich,
as the gap between the forward earnings-yield and the real ten-year Treasury
yield has remained extremely narrow.
Third-quarter earnings reports will begin to come out in a few weeks. So far, the
number of warnings about third-quarter earnings has been fairly typical, after
two quarters of relatively few warnings, which suggests that positive earnings
surprises this quarter will not be outsized.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Commercial mortgage interest rates continued to rise in August, and despite the
downturn in September, they remain more than 100 basis points above the level
at the end of last year. Yields on commercial mortgage-backed securities
(CMBS) have displayed similar movements.
CMBS issuance is expected to total around $15 billion for the third quarter,
slightly below previous expectations, as a few deals were postponed when yields
rose in late August. Although issuance is up from the second quarter, it remains
well below the pace of 1998. Since early this year, institutions that supply loans
for CMBS have indicated that their originations have been well below
expectations. Anecdotal reports suggest that the rise in interest rates over this
period has hurt demand for refinancing. In addition, after the events of last fall,
conduit lenders have been less aggressive in their mortgage pricing. Newly
available data for the second quarter indicate that other lenders--depository
institutions, life insurance companies, and federal agencies--have picked up
market share, partly because of the less favorable pricing of conduits. On the
whole, originations for new development have remained strong.
Conditions in commercial real estate markets continued to be solid, with low
vacancy rates, moderately rising prices, and few markets reporting imbalances.
These conditions have translated into the lowest delinquency rates for
commercial mortgage loans held by insurance companies in the thirty-four year
history of that series; similarly, Call Report data on commercial real estate loans
at banks show very low delinquency rates through the second quarter.

Household Finance
Household borrowing appears to have remained fairly rapid in the third quarter.
The growth of consumer credit picked up in July, as revolving debt continued
strong and nonrevolving debt turned around from its weak June showing.
Commercial bank data (adjusted for securitization) show an acceleration of
consumer loans in August and September. The limited evidence available on
mortgage debt growth also suggests strength, consistent with indicators of a still-
buoyant housing market. Residential real estate loans at commercial banks,
which grew moderately in July, surged in August. The Mortgage Bankers
Association home purchase index is still at a high level, though it has dropped
back from its recent peak. In contrast, refinancing activity has stayed in the
doldrums.
Indicators of household credit quality remain favorable. The delinquency rate
for auto loans at finance companies fell to its lowest level in the past five years,
and delinquencies for securitized credit card receivables remained on a
downward trend. In addition, the delinquency series from the American Bankers
Association on closed-end consumer loans showed a marked drop in the second
quarter. A more comprehensive series from bank Call Reports, which has
diverged from the ABA series in recent years, also turned down, but only
slightly.
The ratio of household net worth to income likely fell in the third quarter in large
part because of declines in equity prices. Responding to these price declines,
mutual fund shareholders added only about $10 billion to their equity fund
holdings in August, the lowest amount in the past six months. Weekly data (not
shown) indicate a similar pace of inflows into equity funds during September.
Bond funds experienced modest outflows in August, and are on track for a
considerably larger outflow in September. Data on 401(k) pension plans give a
more mixed picture of household allocations between equities and bonds
through August, as contributions to, and transfers of, plan assets were funneled
into both equity and fixed income funds.
Government Finance
Treasury. In early August, the Treasury announced that it was aiming for an
$80 billion year-end cash balance, which would be much larger than usual. To
raise this much cash, the Treasury planned to increase bill auction sizes
moderately and to issue a substantial amount of cash management bills, perhaps
starting as early as September. Since these cash management bills were likely to
mature in January, the prospect of additional supply pushed up yields on existing
bills maturing after the turn of the year. Following that announcement, however,
bill auction sizes were reduced by $1 billion in late August and again in early

September. These cutbacks depressed yields on bills maturing in December,
including the current three-month bill. Strong quarterly tax payments in
September have validated these cuts to some extent and have delayed the likely
issuance of cash management bills until later this year. With such bills still
likely to mature in January, this prospective supply has kept elevated the yields
on existing bills maturing then.
Federal agency. Debt issuance by government-sponsored enterprises remained
brisk over the intermeeting period, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the
Federal Home Loan Bank System all issuing substantial amounts. As the
agencies have maneuvered for benchmark status in light of the projected secular
decline in Treasury issuance, they have had a generally favorable reception from
investors. The FHLB "Tap" program (described in the August Greenbook) has
gotten off to a good start, and Freddie Mac's ten-year Reference Note was
increased from $4 billion to $6 billion in response to strong investor demand.
Under Freddie Mac's new financing calendar, five-year Reference Notes will be
issued in January and July and ten-year Reference Notes in March and
September. Freddie Mac also announced the recent ten-year Reference Note two
weeks before issuance, instead of the usual two days, in an effort to develop the
when-issued market.
As noted above in the section on liquidity and year-end concerns, agency
spreads--which are linked to swap spreads because the agencies make heavy use
of swaps for hedging and arbitrage--have narrowed somewhat since the last
FOMC in tandem with swap spreads. The agencies' recent efforts to enhance
the liquidity of their benchmark issues may have also altered market perceptions
and contributed to the narrowing.
State and local. Gross issuance of long-term debt in August and September,
which averaged about $15 billion per month, was down from the July pace
because of a decline in refunding activity. Refunding has been held down by the
rise in interest rates this year, although improvements in the credit quality of
individual issuers have encouraged some refunding deals to come to market
despite rising rates. New capital issuance remained strong in August and
September, reflecting hefty outlays for educational facilities and transportation
projects.
Yields on long-term municipal bonds rose over the intermeeting period, lifting
slightly the ratio of the thirty-year revenue bond yield to the thirty-year Treasury
yield. Strong supply of municipal bonds relative to Treasuries and some
weakening of demand, as evidenced by outflows from tax-exempt mutual funds,
contributed to the underperformance of municipal bonds.

The credit quality of municipal issuers has shown further improvement in recent
months. As has been the case for several years, Standard and Poor's upgraded
more issues (both in number and dollar volume) than they downgraded. The
exception remained health care issuers, some of which have reported increased
costs for bond insurance and letters of credit.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 continued to grow in August at about the average 5-1/2 percent pace of the
preceding several months, despite a further rise in opportunity costs. Liquid
deposits in M2 grew moderately, and retail money market mutual funds picked
up, as households slowed their contributions to equity and bond mutual funds.
The currency component continued its rapid advance in August, perhaps
reflecting robust retail sales; preliminary data for September show a noticeable
acceleration, but it is not yet clear whether the additional strength is related to a
precautionary buildup of liquidity by households in advance of year-end. Thus
far in September, M2 is growing somewhat faster than in August because of
strength in liquid deposits and currency.
M3 also continued to expand at a moderate rate in August and into the first half
of September. Institution-only money market mutual funds accounted for most
of the non-M2 expansion in M3, as their yields caught up to previous increases
in short-term market rates. In contrast, large time deposits ran off last month
because banks used nondeposit funds to finance the sizable acceleration of bank
credit.
The pickup in bank credit in August owed entirely to loans. Business loans
surged, even as loan pricing appeared to firm, because companies found
conditions in the junk bond market unreceptive. Solid business loan growth
seems to have continued through mid-September. Real estate loans grew rapidly
in August, with both residential and commercial components showing strength,
and growth has continued at a brisk rate in September.

In July, the value of exports rose 1/2 percent to a level that was 1 percent higher
than the second-quarter average. The increase resulted primarily from a jump in
exports of industrial machinery and semiconductors. Aircraft exports increased
slightly as a gain in exported engines and parts more than offset a drop in
completed aircraft. Exports of automotive products and industrial supplies,
which had increased in the second quarter, declined somewhat in July. Exports
of consumer goods increased.
The value of imports rose 1 percent in July following increases of 3 to 4 percent
in each of the prior two months in response to the strength of U.S. domestic
demand. The increase in July was spread among aircraft, consumer goods,
industrial supplies, and oil. Imports of automotive products rose slightly as
lower imports from Canada and Mexico offset higher imports from the rest of
the world. The level of goods and services imports in July was 4 percent higher
than the average for the second quarter.
Quantity and price of imported oil. The value of imported oil increased in
July as the pickup in prices outstripped a slight decline in quantity. The average
price of imported oil rose from $13.65 per barrel in April to $16.80 per barrel in
July. A cutback in supplies, primarily from OPEC, and strengthening world
demand drove the rise in oil prices.

Oil Prices
Dollars per barrel

IV-5
More recently, oil prices have risen further as OPEC continues to curtail
production. The members of OPEC, at their September 22 ministerial meeting,
reaffirmed their intentions to hold back production through March 2000. The
monthly average spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) increased from
$20 per barrel in July to $21.25 in August. Spot WTI is currently trading near
$25 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. In August, prices of imported non-oil
goods were unchanged for the second consecutive month. Prices of "core"
goods imports (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) were flat
with little change in all major categories. For July-August combined, the price
for "core" goods imports rose 3/4 percent at an annual rate from the second-
quarter average, compared with declines in the first two quarters of the year.
Strong increases in the prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies
(particularly lumber) in July-August and a small rise in the prices of imported
automotive products more than offset declines recorded for prices of imported
machinery (other than computers and semiconductors), foods (especially coffee),
and consumer goods. Prices of imported computers and semiconductors fell at
about a 9 percent annual rate.
Prices of exported goods rose slightly in August reflecting higher prices for both
agricultural products (reversing a drop in July) and industrial supplies (the fifth
consecutive month of increase). For July-August combined, prices of
agricultural exports declined 5 percent at an annual rate from the second quarter
average; prices of "core" goods exports (which exclude agricultural products,
computers, and semiconductors) rose 1-1/4 percent at an annual rate, nearly the
same rate of increase as in the second quarter. Prices of exported industrial
supplies rose modestly, while automotive products and consumer goods
registered small increases. Prices of exported computers and semiconductors
fell at an 8 to 9 percent annual rate.
U.S. Current Account
In the second quarter, the U.S. current account deficit increased to $322 billion
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, $47 billion larger than in the first quarter.
The higher deficit on goods and services trade resulted from a substantial
increase in imports that surpassed a small increase in exports. The balances on
net investment income and other net income and transfers also weakened, partly
reversing the previous quarter's improvement. The negative balance on net
investment income grew slightly as declines in direct investment receipts more
than offset an increase in portfolio income. The larger deficit in other income
and transfers was mainly driven by increased U.S. government grant
disbursements.

Note: The data for 1999:Q2 include revised trade figures for June that became
available with the release of the July trade data.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
In July, for the first time this year, U.S. residents' purchases of foreign securities
exceeded their sales (line 5 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions
table). Although the $5 billion in net purchases was not particularly large, it
does represent a return to the pattern seen prior to the recent financial turmoil.
The most pronounced change between the first half of this year and July was in
U.S. transactions in European equities. During the first half, U.S. residents
recorded average monthly net sales of almost $7 billion. In July, net sales of
European equities were only $1 billion. Since February, U.S. residents have
been acquiring Japanese equities at a pace of nearly $3.5 billion per month.
These purchases picked up further in July.
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities accelerated further in July, as a huge
increase in purchases of corporate and agency bonds more than outweighed a
slowing in foreign purchases of U.S. equities and an increase in foreign sales of
Treasuries (lines 4a-c). Of the $27 billion in net purchases of corporate and
agency bonds, roughly $7 billion was of agencies, continuing the shift toward
agencies.

IV-7
Foreign official inflows to the United States were almost $8 billion in July (line
1), primarily reflecting an increase in Japanese official reserve assets in the
United States following their foreign exchange market intervention. Partial data
from the FRBNY show that between end-July and mid-September foreign
official reserves in the United States rose another $7 billion, again reflecting
Japanese intervention purchases.
Banking enterprises recorded net capital outflows of almost $20 billion in July
(line 3), nearly reversing a similar inflow in June. However, monthly banking
flows have become even more volatile in the wake of recent large cross-border
merger and acquisition activity, and staff attach little importance to large
monthly swings.
Recently released balance of payments data for 1999:Q2 show very large inflows
through foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7), again
associated with merger and acquisition activity. Of the $118 billion inflow, the
foreign acquisition of AirTouch alone accounts for over $60 billion. U.S. direct
investment abroad also remained strong in the second quarter (line 6) and was
only slightly lower than the record pace set in 1999:Q1. Many of the large
acquisitions in recent years have included a sizable equity component whereby
shares in the acquired firm are swapped for shares in the acquiring firm. These
swaps are not picked up in the Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting
system and thus are not included in line 5.b. These swaps are, however,
included in "Other" flows, line 9, and account for most of the large outflows in
recent quarters.
The statistical discrepancy in the international accounts was a negative $36
billion in the second quarter, indicating reported net capital inflows greatly
exceeded the recorded current account deficit. While there are undoubtedly
errors in the reporting of both current transactions and those on the capital
account, the size and complexity of recent merger activity has strained the
statistical reporting system for financial flows. As a result, most of the recent
discrepancy probably owes to overstated net capital inflows rather than an
understated current account deficit.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the August FOMC meeting, the dollar has weakened 3/4 percent against
the broad index of foreign currencies. During the period, the dollar depreciated
nearly 2-1/4 percent in terms of the major currencies index but appreciated about
1-1/4 percent in terms of the currencies of our other important trading partners.
Most of the dollar's decline against the major currencies index is due to its 4-1/2
percent depreciation against the yen. The dollar also lost 2 percent against the
Canadian dollar, 2-1/4 percent against sterling, and 2-3/4 percent against the
Australian dollar.

June July August September
The dollar's latest bout of weakness against the yen began on September 8,
when the release of Japanese national accounts data revealed that economic
activity expanded in the second quarter, a touch better than the market
consensus expectation that GDP would fall. The dollar dropped 3 percent
against the yen within 24 hours. In response, Japanese monetary authorities
intervened to buy dollars on September 10, which temporarily halted the yen's
rise. However, the yen resumed its strengthening course in short order.
Another round of intervention on September 14 had little apparent effect; the
dollar depreciated further against the yen, touching a low of about ¥103.50. The
downward trend was interrupted by rumors both that the Bank of Japan might
adopt more stimulative measures, such as unsterilized intervention or other
methods of injecting additional liquidity into the Japanese economy, and that the
United States and other countries were considering joining Japanese authorities

IV-10
in coordinated intervention to weaken the yen. However, following its meeting
on September 21, the Bank of Japan's Policy Board released a statement that
reaffirmed its policy of maintaining the overnight call rate near zero and rejected
both unsterilized intervention and other methods of further expanding liquidity.
The unwillingness of the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy in order to
weaken the yen led market participants to view coordinated intervention as even
less likely than before and the value of the yen crept up. However, the yen gave
up some of its earlier gains against the dollar following the meetings of G-7
officials that began on September 25. The G-7 communique expressed concern
about the yen's appreciation and Bank of Japan Governor Hayami and other
officials indicated that there might be some room for Japanese monetary policy
to respond to foreign exchange developments. Since the G-7 meetings, the
dollar has been supported by market speculation that G-7 officials may have
reached a substantive agreement involving additional monetary easing by the
Bank of Japan and possible coordinated intervention.
Japanese ten-year government bond yields declined 25 basis points on balance
over the period, as implied yields on Euroyen contracts fell by as much as 50
basis points. The Nikkei index fell 5-1/4 percent on balance, led by export-
sector and technology shares. Other Asian equity indexes fell as well during

the intermeeting period. Equity prices slid 5-1/2 percent in Hong Kong,
10 percent in Indonesia, 11-1/2 percent in Malaysia, and almost 13 percent in
Thailand. The Indonesian rupiah lost nearly 10 percent against the dollar amid
the political and social turmoil that ensued following the vote for independence
in East Timor. The Thai baht depreciated 7-3/4 percent owing to disappointing
data on the pace of recent economic growth, concerns about non-performing
loans, and worries about upcoming debt payments.
In the euro area, ten-year government bond yields rose 33 basis points over the
intermeeting period, narrowing the spread to comparable U.S. Treasuries by
about 30 basis points. Share prices declined moderately in most of the countries
in the euro area, but were up slightly in France and Italy.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) surprised markets
on September 8 by raising its official repo rate 25 basis points, to 5.25 percent.
The MPC stated that while near-term inflation was expected to remain below
target, preemptive policy action was necessary to forestall future inflationary
pressures. British stock prices have fallen 8-1/2 percent, and ten-year gilt yields
have risen 54 basis points since the time of the August FOMC meeting.
The price of gold was unusually volatile during the intermeeting period, soaring
well above $300 per ounce near the end of the period, mostly in response to
official actions. Gold prices were boosted by a better-than-expected response to
an auction of gold conducted by the Bank of England on September 21, and the
IMF's announcement on September 23 that it would revalue, but not sell, its
stock of gold. The rally intensified following the announcement on September
26 that the ECB and 14 national European central banks had reached an
agreement to limit their sales of gold to 400 metric tons a year for the next five
years. The central banks also agreed not to expand their gold leasing activities.
Latin American financial markets were relatively quiet during much of the
period, although some countries experienced heightened financial stress. The
Colombian peso and Chilean peso depreciated against the dollar by 5 percent
and 3 percent, respectively, as authorities abandoned their crawling-peg
exchange rate regimes. Ecuador announced that it would cover only part of the
interest payments due September 28 on its Brady bonds, paying only the interest
due on uncollateralized bonds. Despite these developments, the EMBI spread
declined about 120 basis points, on balance. The Brazilian real depreciated 3-
1/4 percent, but the Mexican peso was little changed on balance, supported in
part by rising crude oil prices. Equity prices rose 9-1/2 percent in Argentina, 12
percent in Brazil, and nearly 24 percent in Venezuela, but fell 2-1/2 percent in
Mexico.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Incoming data for the foreign industrial countries suggest that on balance
economic activity has improved since earlier this year. In Japan, second-quarter
GDP posted a slight gain, although available third quarter indicators are mixed.
Real GDP in the second quarter expanded only modestly in the euro zone, with
activity in Germany especially weak, but available third-quarter data and
forward-looking confidence indicators suggest improvement in the second half
of the year. In the United Kingdom, growth picked up in the second quarter and
indicators point to further acceleration, while economic activity in Canada
appears to be continuing at a robust pace.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued in these countries, although higher oil
prices have contributed to an uptick in headline measures. Japanese core
consumer prices were unchanged in the twelve months to August. Euro-zone
inflation has edged up recently, but twelve-month inflation remains close to 1
percent. Canadian core inflation remains below the midpoint of the Bank of
Canada's 1 to 3 percent target band, and U.K. inflation has edged down to close
to 2 percent.
In Japan, real GDP posted a 0.9 percent (SAAR) increase during the second
quarter, bringing growth during the first half of the year to 4.5 percent (SAAR).
The twin engines of growth were private consumption and residential
investment, which registered an outsized 82 percent gain, stimulated by tax
incentives. By contrast, business fixed investment declined 14.9 percent, the
fifth double-digit decline in the past six quarters, and public demand contracted
8.9 percent as impetus from the stimulus packages announced during 1998
waned. External demand contributed only slightly to growth.
Available economic indicators for the third quarter are mixed. Industrial
production during August rebounded sharply, rising to its highest level since the
first quarter of 1998, but July housing starts were down sharply from levels
during the first half of the year. The household expenditure series during July
was up slightly from the second-quarter average, but retail sales for July and
August on average were down 0.6 percent from the second quarter average.
Production and shipments of investment goods in July registered a sharp
rebound from the very weak second-quarter average, but private machinery
orders were down slightly. July unemployment remained at 4.9 percent, a record
high, and the offers to applicants ratio remained at 0.46, a record low. The
Tokyo "core" CPI in August was unchanged from a year earlier.

Japan's merchandise trade surplus during the first eight months of 1999 was
$110 billion at an annual rate, essentially unchanged from the $108 billion
surplus during all of 1998. Denominated in dollars, imports during the first
eight months of the year were up 4.3 percent from their 1998 average, while
exports were up 3.6 percent. In recent months, Japanese exports to developing
Asia have surged, as recovery in these countries has taken hold, but exports to
Europe have declined significantly from 1998 levels.
In mid-August, Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
announced the formation of a business alliance. They expect to form a joint
holding company by the fall of 2000 and to integrate their businesses in early
2002. The resulting bank would have assets of over ¥140 trillion (about $1.3
trillion), making it the largest bank in the world.

Real GDP in the euro zone is estimated to have expanded a modest 1.3 percent
(SAAR) in the second quarter. French and Italian GDP showed moderate
increases, while German GDP was up only slightly.
Limited data on production, as well as recent readings on sentiment and new
orders, suggest a pickup in activity in the third quarter. In Germany, production
was up sharply in July, and new orders for manufactured goods-especially
foreign goods-have been on a rising trend for several months. In Italy, too,
industrial production rose in July, following the decline in the second quarter.
Optimism in most of the euro-zone countries has been building in recent
months, with improvement in the industrial, consumer, and construction
components of the euro-11 confidence index.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged down to 10.2
percent in July, about percentage point below its year-ago level and 1 1/2
percent below its recent peak in 1997. (In constructing the harmonized
unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes national statistics to International
Labor Organization definitions.) The German unemployment rate remained

IV-16
unchanged in both July and August, while the French unemployment rate fell
slightly in July.

The euro-area harmonized CPI rose 1.1 percent in the twelve months to August,
extending the upward trend since June, but twelve-month inflation is still below
the European Central Bank (ECB)'s target rate of 2 percent. Noticeable
differences persist among individual countries, with inflation rates in Germany,
Austria, Belgium, and France below 1 percent, while rates in the Netherlands,
Spain, Portugal, and Ireland are a touch above 2 percent.

At its meeting on September 9, the Governing Council of the ECB left official
interest rates unchanged. In a press conference following the September 9
meeting, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said that price pressures should
remain contained and that harmonized inflation is expected to remain below the
2 percent ceiling for the foreseeable future. However, President Duisenberg also
indicated that the Council remains concerned by recent M3 growth, which
increased to 5.6 percent for the 12 months ending in August from a revised 5.5
percent for the twelve month period ending in July. The ECB's reference value
is for annual M3 growth of 4.5 percent.

The pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom picked up markedly in
the second quarter, with real GDP expanding 2.6 percent (SAAR), the strongest
increase in nearly two years. Consumption expenditures increased a robust 4.4
percent, while the increase in fixed investment spending was more modest.
Strength in residential construction was offset by a decline in government fixed
investment. Total domestic demand was held back by a sizable inventory
drawdown that subtracted 3.1 percentage points from growth. Net exports
contributed positively to growth for the first time in nearly two years, as export
growth resumed and imports increased only moderately.

Incoming data indicate that activity continued to strengthen in the third quarter.
Industrial production picked up further in July, and manufacturing surveys
suggest continued expansion in August. Retail sales have remained strong, with
the volume of sales for July and August on average increasing 1.2 percent from
the second-quarter average. Business confidence has improved markedly since
late last year, with output expectations rising from a percent balance of -27 last
November to +17 in both August and September.
Labor market conditions have continued to improve. The official claims-based
unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in August, the lowest rate in nearly 20 years,
and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate edged down to
5.9 percent for the May-July period. Wage growth has remained moderate;
"headline" annual average earnings growth was 4.2 percent for the three months
centered in July, slightly lower than average growth recorded in the first half of
the year.

Inflationary pressures remain contained, with the twelve-month rate of retail
price inflation (excluding mortgage interest rates) comfortably below the official
target of 2.5 percent. Producer input prices for materials and fuel have edged up
since April, primarily reflecting higher oil prices.
Canadian real GDP rose 3.3 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter, led by a
surge in capital spending. Strong demand for computers, reportedly fueled in
part by Y2K preparations, was the primary contributor to the surge in capital
spending, but investment in other types of machinery and equipment also posted
sizable gains. The pace of government spending picked up due to increased
health care spending, while consumer spending grew a more moderate 3 percent
after a sharp rise in the first quarter. Net exports made a large negative
contribution to growth, as much of the runup in investment spending was on
imports. Export growth slowed partly due to a decline in automotive exports
and foreign travel expenditures.

Limited third-quarter indicators suggest that activity remains vigorous. New
manufacturing orders surged in July, and job growth resumed after a decline in
employment in the second quarter. Retail sales rose sharply in July, after
posting moderate gains in May and June.

IV-22
After rising sharply in the second quarter, increases in core consumer prices
(which exclude food and energy prices) were extremely modest in both July and
August. As a result, twelve-month core inflation remained 1.6 percent in
August, well within the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent target range. Higher
gasoline prices, however, pushed the twelve-month inflation rate for the overall
index in August to 2.1 percent, its highest level in almost three years.
Nominal wages have risen sharply this year. Average hourly wages for
permanent workers were up 2.9 percent in August from a year ago, almost
double the pace recorded at the end of last year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economies in most of developing Asia continue to recover, with the exception
of Indonesia, which remains plagued by domestic problems. ASEAN growth
has helped pull Hong Kong out of its recession, while in China there are
indications that economic activity may have picked up. In Latin America, in
contrast, activity remains weak, with the major exception of Mexico. Argentina
continued to experience deflationary pressures. In Brazil, there is no conclusive
evidence that the recovery seen in the first half of the year has continued. In
Russia, economic activity has weakened, and the outlook there continues to be
clouded by political problems. The relatively weak level of domestic demand in
the major developing economies has dampened inflationary pressures.
Ecuador's failure to honor fully its Brady bonds seems to have had limited
effects on other developing country financial markets.
In developing Asia, the economic rebound narrowed trade surpluses in general
over the first half of the year. However, several economies recorded a jump in
exports in July (and August in China). In Latin America, trade performance has
been mixed. Brazilian and Argentine exports have been depressed by low
commodity prices, weak demand in major trading partners, and, in Argentina's
case, the real appreciation of its currency. Mexico's trade deficit narrowed on
balance over the July-August period owing to continued rapid export growth.
In Brazil, there were mixed signals concerning whether the economy was
continuing to recover from the recession registered during the second half of
1998. Industrial output increased on balance over the second quarter, but
registered a 1.3 percent decline in June (SA) and a small decline in July. The
unemployment rate has remained high. The still weak economy helped keep
inflationary pressures at bay, offsetting to some extent the 15 percent
depreciation of the real against the dollar between mid-May and end-August.
Consumer price inflation (as measured by the IPC-A) declined from 1.2 percent
in July to 0.3 percent in August (SA), suggesting that the effects of the
government's increases in utilities prices in June and July have receded. Brazil
continued to see less trade adjustment than had been expected after the collapse
of the real early this year; exports have been depressed by weak demand in Latin
American trading partners (especially Argentina) and by low world commodity
prices.
On September 22, the central bank's monetary policy council, the COPOM,
reduced the overnight lending rate (the Selic) from 19.5 to 19 percent. The
decline had been expected, due to lower-than-anticipated inflation recently and
the weak economy. The Selic rate had not been changed since late July, but the
central bank had reduced Brazil's very high reserve requirements somewhat in
early September to boost liquidity.

Since late August, yields on dollar-denominated and real-denominated Brazilian
instruments have declined roughly 100-300 basis points. These declines most
likely reflected three events that signaled the government's commitment to fiscal
and monetary discipline. First, in late August, the government unveiled its year
2000 fiscal budget for the central government, which was well received. The
budget projects a primary surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP, putting it within reach
of the IMF program target of a surplus of 3-1/4 percent of GDP for the entire
public sector. Second, in early September, President Cardoso sacked the
development minister, who had been advocating more expansionary policies and
who had criticized Finance Minister Pedro Malan. Third, the government
quashed initiatives from the strong rural bloc in congress to provide a generous
bailout package to farmers. Cardoso's popularity ratings, however, have
remained in the doldrums, and analysts remain concerned about the slow pace of
fiscal and other reforms.
In Mexico, the economic recovery continues, although there are some
indications that the very strong pace of growth seen in the second quarter will
not be sustained. Seasonally adjusted industrial production rose 1 percent in
July, about equal to its growth in June, but representing some deceleration
compared with May. The reported unemployment rate rose in August. Inflation
has been trending down in recent months; the twelve-month inflation rate in
August was 16-1/2 percent, down from 18-1/2 percent at end-1998. The
seasonally adjusted trade deficit for July-August narrowed to about $1.5 billion

IV-27
(AR) from over $6 billion (AR) in the second quarter, as export growth outpaced
import growth.

In August, Moody's upgraded Mexico's sovereign ceiling from Ba2 to Bal, and
in September Standard and Poor's raised its rating's outlook for Mexico from
stable to positive. However, S&P identified a number of factors preventing an
upgrade of Mexico's long-term foreign-currency debt rating, currently BB,
including the fragility of its banking sector. On September 21, the Mexican
government unveiled a new plan designed to bring its bank capitalization rules
more in line with international standards.
On the political front, on-going negotiations have not yet resulted in an
agreement between the major opposition parties that would put up a joint
presidential candidate to oppose the ruling party's candidate. So far, neither of
the two major opposition parties' candidates, Vincente Fox of the right-wing
PAN or Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-wing PRD, have indicated any
willingness to step down. For the first time, the ruling party, the PRI, will select
its presidential nominee through a primary (to be held on November 7); in the
past, the party had automatically chosen as its presidential candidate the person
nominated by the outgoing president.

In Argentina, data released since the last Greenbook point to continued weak
economic performance on balance. Second quarter GDP has fallen almost
5 percent from the same quarter last year, and all indications suggest that the
drop in output for 1999 as a whole will be worse than the Tequila Crisis in 1995.
Industrial production jumped in August, but was down 7.1 percent from its year
earlier level. While the IP number may hint of a turnaround, other indicators
have pointed to continued weakness in economic activity, including a nearly
2 percent decline in consumer prices over the 12 months ending in August.
Argentina registered a trade deficit in July, as the Brazilian devaluation early this
year and low world prices of commodities continue to depress exports.

Argentina is now in the final month of its presidential campaign; elections will
be held on October 24. After unsettling comments by presidential hopefuls
shook international markets earlier this summer, concerted efforts to calm the
markets by financial advisors of the main candidates have had limited success.
The stock market index has returned to its level of early July, but was 15 percent
below its recent peak in early May. Interest rates have remained elevated. The
IMF has been working with the current government as well as the candidates on
a financing package. In late September, the IMF indicated that funds would be
made available to Argentina in return for fiscal adjustments and labor market
reforms.

IV-29
In Venezuela, the weak economy continued to take a back seat to politics. Real
GDP in the first half of the year was 9-1/2 percent below its level last year,
reflecting declines in domestic demand. The fall in output helped mute
inflationary pressures; consumer price inflation rose 22-1/2 percent over the
12 months ended August, down from 36-1/2 percent over the same period a year
earlier.

Since July, when a Chavez-dominated assembly was elected to rewrite the
constitution, this assembly has, in addition to debating Chavez's proposed
constitution, acted to disband the Supreme Court and take on many of the
governing responsibilities of the Congress. In consequence, uncertainty
surrounding the political situation continues to depress Venezuelan asset prices
and investor confidence in prospects for the Venezuelan economy more
generally.
In Korea, recent data provide further evidence of a robust recovery. Real GDP
in the second quarter increased at about a 15 percent annual rate, matching the
very rapid growth in the first quarter. Second quarter growth was boosted by
strong increases in consumption and fixed investment. A slowing in the rate of
inventory decumulation also made a significant positive contribution to growth,
while net exports made a slight negative contribution. Industrial production
declined slightly in August after posting another substantial increase in July.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.7 percent in August, nearly 2 percentage

IV-30
points below its level of a year earlier. Despite this rapid growth, inflation has
remained low, with year-over-year consumer price increases running below
1 percent.
With recovery apparently well established, the government's recently released
budget for next year calls for slower growth of spending and a reduced deficit.
Total expenditures are projected to increase by only 5 percent-the lowest rate of
increase in nearly a decade-while the deficit as a percent of GDP is expected to
be 3-1/2 percent, down from an estimated 4 percent this year.
On September 17, the Financial Supervisory Commission announced that final
agreement had been reached on the sale of a controlling interest in Korea First
Bank to Newbridge Capital, a U.S.-based investment fund. A tentative
agreement had been reached last December, but this was followed by months of
contentious negotiations over the terms of the sale as Korean economic
prospects brightened. Last month, the government abandoned an attempt to sell
Seoulbank to Hong Kong Shanghai Bank when final terms could not be agreed
upon. The government had promised to sell both of these troubled banks as part
of its agreement with the IMF.

The ASEAN region shows clear signs of continued recovery, with the exception
of Indonesia, which continues to be plagued by internal problems. Malaysian
GDP growth in the second quarter was remarkably strong, fueled largely by a
rebound in the global electronics market. Philippine second-quarter GDP
growth continued to indicate a robust recovery from its mild recession of 1998.
Announced Thai GDP growth for the second quarter was significantly slower

than anticipated and inconsistent with monthly indicators, which suggested
significant strength in the second quarter. July's industrial production for
Singapore and Malaysia indicated a slowing in the torrid pace of second-quarter
growth as electronic components demand slackened, but Thai industrial
production continued to grow. Remaining excess capacity continues to dampen
inflation across the region.

Apart from an extraordinary July surge in exports from Malaysia, Thailand and
Singapore, trade surpluses throughout the region have begun to narrow since late
last year, as import growth has outpaced export gains.
ASEAN financial markets have been depressed by a series of largely unrelated
events across the region. The Indonesian rupiah has fallen 20 percent since
mid-July in response to broadening banking scandals and unrest in East Timor
following its August independence referendum. The banking scandal, involving
possible malfeasance by members of the ruling Golkar party, has also stalled
further disbursements of funds from the IMF and World Bank. The currencies
of the Philippines and Thailand have depreciated since July on market

Thailand announced that it plans to make no further drawings on its
$17.2 billion IMF package, after having drawn a total of $13.5 billion. Thailand
will retain its IMF program and the rights to draw from its line of credit in the
future, but further drawings seem unlikely, given the rebuilding of Thai reserves
and a continued current account surplus. As part of its IMF agreement, the Thai
government sold a majority stake in one of five nationalized banks to a foreign
financial institution.

Less than $1 billion in foreign funds were repatriated from Malaysia following
the expiration of the one-year holding period mandated by the imposition of
capital controls on September 1, 1998. This sum was less than had been
anticipated. In late September, Malaysia unexpectedly changed its two-tier exit
tax scheme, removing the higher levy for funds invested for less than one year.
Hong Kong has finally emerged from recession, with economic activity
rebounding strongly in the second quarter, partly reflecting a sharp increase in
regional trade, which greatly benefits Hong Kong's entrepot economy.
Consumer prices continue to fall sharply, contributing to high real interest rates.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised base interest rates 25 basis points to
6.75 percent in late August; shortly afterwards Hong Kong banks raised their
deposit rates a similar amount, to 3.75 percent. Preliminary data indicate that
the unemployment rate edged up to 6.1 percent in the June-August period from
6 percent in the May-July period. Spreads between one-year Hong Kong
government debt and U.S. Treasuries were around 70 basis points on
September 28, down sharply from their levels of nearly 280 basis points in
January.

In China, there are some signs that economic activity may be picking up after
slowing sharply earlier in the year. Industrial production grew strongly in July,
while soaring exports in July and August caused the trade surplus, which had
narrowed sharply in the first half of the year, to widen significantly. Deflation
continues, however, reflecting weak private domestic demand. In August, the
government unveiled a series of new stimulus measures including a large
increase in spending on infrastructure, a 30 percent increase in social security
payments to laid-off workers, and an increase in salaries of civil servants and the
pensions of retired state workers.

In Taiwan, second quarter GDP growth was remarkably strong, boosted by
soaring exports of electronic products. The unemployment rate was 2.8 percent
in August (SA), the lowest rate in six months. Inflation remains low. In late
September, an earthquake disrupted industrial production and caused some
damage to infrastructure. However, the key electronics sector is expected to
recuperate quickly. Taiwan's trade and current account surpluses continued to
shrink, albeit from elevated levels, as soaring imports outpaced rapidly growing
exports. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rose to a record $100 billion at the
end of August. Stock prices in Taiwan have mostly recovered from the sharp
drop in July, although political tensions between China and Taiwan remain
heightened.
In Russia, after staging a recovery over the first half of 1999, industrial output
declined in July and August. Unemployment appears to have peaked at just over
14 percent. Monthly consumer price inflation reached a low for the year of
1.2 percent in August. The trade surplus widened, boosted by the improvement
in Russia's international competitiveness following the 1998 collapse of the
ruble and the rise in oil prices. Negotiations for restructuring Russia's heavy
external debt obligations are underway. However, investigations into alleged
illegal financial activities are expected to delay the next disbursement of the
$4.5 billion IMF program that was approved last July.
