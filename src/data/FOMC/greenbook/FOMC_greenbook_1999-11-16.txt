DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Recent data have presented a picture of vigorous economic expansion. Most
notably, the October employment report confirmed that the demand for workers
has remained strong. Despite what seems to be an increasingly tight labor
market, though, wages have continued to rise at a lower rate than they did last
year. Price increases have remained subdued at the consumer level, at least
outside the energy sector; increases in the cost of materials and intermediate
components evidently are still being offset through productivity gains or
absorbed in profit margins.
Real GDP
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis's (BEA) advance estimate, real
GDP rose at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter. Subsequently, we
have received additional source data that point to an upward revision to around
5.4 percent. The largest anticipated revision is to inventory investment; some
upward revision to construction expenditures in each of the residential,
nonresidential, and state and local sectors is expected as well. Unless otherwise
noted, the discussion of third-quarter activity in the remainder of this section of
the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions to the GDP data.
Labor Market Developments
Data on the labor market received since the last Greenbook indicate that
employment continues to grow at an appreciable clip, as strong payroll growth in
October offset September's weakness.' Moreover, initial claims for
unemployment insurance since the October reference week have remained near
their lowest levels since the late 1980s, and the ratio of initial claims to payroll
employment is at its lowest level since the claims series began in the late 1960s.
More broadly, the average monthly increase in payroll employment since
midyear has been in line with gains during the first half.
In the payroll survey, employment growth in services; wholesale trade, finance,
insurance, and real estate; and government rebounded in October from their
weak showings in September. Manufacturing employment continued its
1-1/2 year slide, although its rate of decline has moderated somewhat since
midyear, while job losses were posted in retail trade in both September and
October.
1. Based on a very rough calculation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated that
Hurricane Floyd may have reduced payroll employment growth by about 60,000 in September,
and a similar calculation suggests that October's employment growth may have been boosted by
about half that amount. Although some analysts have interpreted these figures as indicating that
more of a bounceback is still to come, we would caution against drawing such a strong
conclusion from these very rough estimates.

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls in October more than rebounded from their hurricane-
depressed September level. The index of aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers rose 0.7 percent in October, more than retracing
September's decline. Hours in October stood 0.5 percent (not at an annual rate)
above their third-quarter average; the rebound from the effects of Hurricane
Floyd likely boosted this figure by 0.1 percentage point.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked down 0.1 percentage
point in October as the rates for adult women and for teenagers both fell. At the
same time, the percentage of the population who were not in the labor force but
reported wanting a job ticked down further in October. An increase in the labor
force participation rate of teenagers drove the aggregate participation rate up
0.1 percentage point, to 67 percent. Aside from a spike last winter, the
participation rate has run between 66.9 percent and 67.1 percent since March
1998.

2. Nonfinancial corporate sector includes all corporations doing business in
the United States except banks, stock and commodity brokers, and finance and
insurance companies; the sector accounts for about two-thirds of

Other surveys of households also continue to bespeak a hot labor market.
Consumers' perceptions of job availability in the Conference Board's October
survey remained near the highest levels in the twenty-year history of the survey,
and their expectations of future availability of jobs in both the Conference
Board's and the University of Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC)
surveys continue to be upbeat. On the employers' side, the percentage of firms
reporting that positions are hard to fill in the NFIB survey remained near its
historical peak. These indicators of labor-market tautness make all the more
impressive the fact that wages, as we shall discuss below, have not been
accelerating this year.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the first estimates of productivity in
the third quarter on November 12. Piecing together available data, we estimate
that the BLS will report that productivity in the nonfarm business sector
increased at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent last quarter. Taking into account our
expected revisions to the third-quarter NIPA figures would raise this estimate to
4-1/4 percent. If the higher figure is realized, the increase in nonfarm business
productivity would be 3 percent over the four quarters ended in 1999:Q3,
1/2 percentage point greater than the increase over the previous four quarters.
The available information also points to a very sizable increase in productivity
for the nonfinancial corporate sector in the third quarter--more than 4 percent on
a four-quarter basis; these data will not be published until December, however.

Industrial Production
Industrial production evidently posted a large gain in October, partly reflecting a
bounceback in manufacturing and utilities output after the Hurricane
Floyd-related slowdown along the eastern seaboard in September. Overall,
output has risen substantially since midyear, and manufacturing capacity
utilization in October is estimated to have been a bit above its first-half average.

Motor vehicle assemblies in October appear to have edged back up above the
13 million unit annual rate that had prevailed through the spring and summer
before a hurricane-related slowing in September. Makers have scheduled
assemblies to remain around this high level in the fourth quarter, and capacity
utilization in production of autos and light trucks currently hovers around
90 percent. Elsewhere in transportation, the production of aircraft and parts
apparently continued to drop in October, consistent with Boeing's plans to
downshift its fourth-quarter completion rates at an annual rate of about
20 percent. In response to a finding that the drip shields installed in 747s, 757s,
767s, and 777s in the past few years were defective, Boeing halted delivery of
thirty-four planes scheduled for this month; nevertheless, Boeing has not
allowed this setback to affect its overall production plans for the fourth quarter.
The production of computer equipment slowed in August and September and
seems to have slackened further in October. However, growth in semiconductor
output, which also slowed in recent months, appears to have stepped up

noticeably in October; the sudden leveling in production of communications
equipment in September also appears to have been an aberration. The
remaining manufacturing industries seem to have recovered from the
widespread hurricane-related weaknesses observed in September. Production of
construction supplies, hampered by unseasonably heavy rainfall in the
Northeast, declined in September but apparently bounced back in October as a
result of post-hurricane reconstruction and increased demand for oil-drilling-
related structures.
The staff series on real adjusted durable goods orders was about unchanged in
September. However, the increase for the third quarter as a whole was quite
robust at about 6 percent and point to solid gains in manufacturing production in
the fourth quarter. The National Association of Purchasing Management's
orders index remained high in October, though it was down somewhat from its
September reading.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles fell in October but remained quite robust. Adjusted for
changes in reporting periods, total light vehicle sales were at an annual rate of
16.2 million units. The drop-off from the extraordinary third-quarter pace of
more than 17 million units reflects a return to a more moderate volume of fleet
sales and some softening in retail sales, mainly at General Motors. Anecdotal
reports suggest that late-model changeovers at General Motors for a couple of
popular models of light trucks damped its sales a bit. In addition, our contact at
General Motors indicated that sales declined in response to higher prices for
some new light truck models and to the company's cessation of incentives in
early October; in response, General Motors reinstated its incentives program
later in the month.
In the near term, the outlook for sales remains solid, bolstered by the
continuation of a favorable pricing environment, including generous incentives
and modest price increases on most models for 2000. Marketing incentives in
the fourth quarter are estimated to have increased to about 6-1/2 percent of the
cost of a new vehicle, although one industry contact believes that this figure is
somewhat higher for the Big Three. Survey data from both the Conference
Board and the Michigan SRC on car-buying plans and attitudes suggest that
consumers still think market conditions are favorable. Motor vehicle
inventories remain fairly lean, but our industry contacts do not expect low days'
supply to materially constrain sales in the coming months.
Business demand for medium and heavy trucks has been extraordinary, as
shipments set a new record of 694,000 units (annual rate) in September. The
strength of truck sales appears to be widespread across size categories. Industry

contacts report strong demand for medium-sized trucks (classes 5 to 7). This in
part reflects more sales of school buses and a surge in demand from shipping
companies that provide local and home delivery service for Internet
merchandisers. Although orders for heavy trucks (class 8) have eased some
since late last year, sales have remained robust, supported by a large backlog of
unfilled orders. Elsewhere, sales of smaller trucks (class 3) have also risen,
likely boosted by consumer as well as business demand for these vehicles.2
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
The growth of consumer spending appears to have moderated somewhat in
recent months. Real PCE grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the third
quarter, a substantial pace but well down from the 5.8 percent rate recorded
during the first half of the year. Spending on motor vehicles remained high in
the third quarter, and outlays for other types of durable goods posted strong
gains. Purchases of nondurable goods increased at an annual rate of 3.6 percent
in the third quarter, with expenditures on gasoline and clothing and shoes rising
especially rapidly. Outlays on services in the third quarter were driven by strong
increases in demand for electricity and natural gas, transportation services, and
recreation services. Fourth-quarter indicators are limited at this juncture, with
the advance retail sales release for October coming out at the end of this week.
As noted above, however, light vehicle sales fell off last month, and chain store
sales reports were mixed.
Personal income was unchanged in September, as uninsured losses due to
Hurricane Floyd held down farm proprietors' income and rental income.3
Nonetheless, personal income was up at an annual rate of nearly 5 percent for
the third quarter as a whole, reflecting continued solid growth in wage and
salary income. However, consumer prices were boosted last quarter by the run-
up in energy prices, and, after factoring in tax payments, real disposable
personal income increased at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent, down more than a
percentage point from the first-half pace. With outlays having risen faster than
disposable income, the personal saving rate declined another 1/2 percentage
point in the third quarter. Wage and salary income should have been up
appreciably last month, judging by the data from the establishment survey on
hours and production-worker wages.
2. The BEA, however, counts all sales of such vehicles as business investment.
3. When uninsured property is lost in a storm, the BEA adjusts down proprietors' income
and rental income to reflect a spike in depreciation (consumption of fixed capital). In the case
of Hurricane Floyd, the BEA adjusted only these two categories; without the adjustments,
personal income would have risen 0.3 percent in September.

The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence and the Michigan SRC's
index of consumer sentiment dropped in October. Despite having moved down
some, on net, since the summer, both indexes remain in the middle of the high
ranges that have been recorded for the past two years.
Housing Markets
Housing demand and home construction have shown clear signs of weakening
in the past few months. Single-family starts declined 2 percent in September to
an annual rate of 1.27 million units, although some of the drop in September
probably resulted from unusually heavy precipitation in the Northeast and in
parts of the South. Starts were in line with adjusted permits. Sales of new
homes plummeted nearly 13 percent to an annual rate of 811,000 units in
September, and the estimates for the three preceding months were revised down
noticeably.4 Although the decline in September appears suspiciously large, the
direction of the movement is certainly consistent with the softening in a number
of other housing market indicators.
Among the more timely indicators of housing demand, builders' ratings of new
home sales continued to edge down in early October, although they remain at a
high level. The Mortgage Bankers Association index of purchase applications
for home mortgages has been little changed in recent weeks, after a substantial
decline from late June through September. In addition, the Michigan SRC's
measure of consumer assessments of homebuying conditions was unchanged in
October after a large decline over the summer that mainly reflected increased
concerns about higher interest rates.
The year-over-year increase in the constant-quality price of new homes reached
5.8 percent in the third quarter, having moved up from an average of about
3 percent in 1997 and 1998. In addition, the year-over-year increase in the
repeat-sales price index for existing homes edged up to 6 percent last quarter.5
Cost pressures have likely contributed to the more rapid rise in new home
prices. Price increases for a number of construction materials picked up notably
4. The previous estimates had shown new home sales strengthening in July and August.
The Census estimates of new home sales are based on a sample of building permits issued by
local governments plus an imputation for sales that occur before the issuance of a permit. The
Census has experienced long-standing problems with this imputation. Indeed, Census staff
report that such difficulties accounted for most of the large revisions to the new home sales
estimates in recent months.
5. Constant-quality new home prices adjust for compositional changes in the geographic
distribution of sales and for changes over time in the size and quality of homes sold. The repeat-
sales price index for existing homes is calculated using price data for homes that are sold
repeatedly or refinanced.

this year, though they have eased a bit in recent months, and the September ECI
reading for total compensation for construction workers was up nearly
3-1/2 percent from a year earlier. The more rapid price increases for both new
and existing homes may also partly reflect a relative scarcity of homes for sale
in many localities: In terms of months' supply, stocks of new and existing
homes for sale in September were down to some of the lowest readings on
record.6
In the multifamily sector, starts in the third quarter were up 19 percent from the
weak second-quarter level and slightly exceeded the average pace for the first
half of this year. Market conditions in the sector generally are favorable: The
value of multifamily rental properties continued to rise rapidly in the second
quarter, and the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units in the third quarter was
a low 8.6 percent. Still, the most recent data point to some softening in
construction. Multifamily starts fell 8 percent in September, fully retracing their
jump in August and likely reflecting to some extent the unusually soggy
weather. Multifamily permits recorded an even sharper decline, leaving the
ratio of multifamily starts to permits at an unusually high level in September.
Because permits tend to be more statistically reliable than starts, this pattern by
itself points to a further weakening in starts in coming months.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and Software. Business investment has continued to boom. Real
business expenditures on equipment and software are estimated to have
expanded at an annual rate of 18-3/4 percent in the third quarter, well above the
12 percent pace recorded in the first half of the year.7 The pickup mainly owed
to a marked acceleration in purchases of computer hardware and transportation
equipment.
We estimate that real outlays on computers and peripheral equipment climbed at
an annual rate of about 60 percent last quarter. The three months of nominal
6. The months' supply of new homes for sale jumped up in September to 4.9 months. The
number of new homes for sale--the numerator of the months' supply ratio--rose about 2 percent
to 314,000 units in September; it was the sharp drop in new home sales, the denominator, that
accounted for most of the rise in the ratio. As noted, preliminary estimates of new home sales
are subject to large revisions; so it would not be surprising if the September sales figure were
revised upward, which would reduce the months' supply reading for September.
7. Our third-quarter estimate is below the BEA's advance figure of 21.7 percent, reflecting
our interpretation of the September data on orders and shipments of durable goods, which the
BEA did not incorporate in its estimates.

shipments data underlying this estimate were quite erratic: Computer shipments
jumped 17-1/2 percent in July (not at an annual rate) before retracing that gain
during August and September. This spike may indicate that businesses moved
some of their hardware spending forward to avoid having brand-new and
untested systems in place around the turn of the millennium. Indeed, several
major computer manufacturers have warned that sales of mainframes and high-
end servers--which are likely to be more sensitive to Y2K considerations than
PCs--appear to be weakening. According to press reports, some computer
producers had expected that, in the fourth quarter, robust PC sales would offset
a slowdown in sales of large-scale items. However, supply disruptions
stemming from the Taiwan earthquake in September reportedly caused several
manufacturers to scale back their fourth-quarter sales expectations.
Real business spending on software is estimated to have increased at an annual
rate of 17-1/2 percent in the third quarter after having averaged a 14 percent
pace over the first half of the year. Although the acceleration in software
expenditures was not so pronounced as for hardware, the general pattern of
spending over the year is similar in the two categories. As with hardware
outlays, software investment was probably boosted by demand from businesses
that were finishing their Y2K remediation plans.8
Real expenditures on transportation equipment were also reported to have
accelerated in the third quarter. As noted, business purchases of medium and
heavy trucks have been strong, and fleet sales of light vehicles registered a
sizable gain in the third quarter. Moreover, available spending indicators
suggest that domestic airlines substantially stepped up their purchases of
commercial aircraft: While Boeing's domestic deliveries appear to have ticked
up only moderately last quarter, Airbus reportedly delivered a record thirty-one
planes to U.S. customers, nearly twice as many as in the second quarter.
Real spending on communications equipment is estimated to have risen at an
annual rate of 16 percent in the third quarter, after likely registering a blistering
increase in the second quarter. Recent orders data point to continued strength in
this spending category: New orders for communications equipment jumped
almost 20 percent (not at an annual rate) in September, and the backlog of
8. The BEA's procedure for constructing its new estimates of software makes use of the
fact that common factors may be affecting software and hardware. For the most recent periods,
current-dollar own-account software, which accounts for about one-third of total software
expenditures, is extrapolated using nominal expenditures on computers and peripheral
equipment. Thus, because a portion of the nominal software estimates is extrapolated using the
rate of increase in hardware spending, the third-quarter acceleration in software spending is
influenced by the pickup in nominal expenditures of computers and peripheral equipment.

unfilled orders increased significantly. Major manufacturers recently reported
substantial strength in the areas of networking, wireless, and fiber-optics
equipment.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, equipment spending appears
to have bounced back from the sluggish pace of advance registered in the first
half of the year. Orders in this category were, on average, above shipments
during the first half of the year, causing the backlog of unfilled orders to rise. In
the third quarter, manufacturers' shipments (excluding high-tech and
transportation) rose 2-1/2 percent (not at an annual rate), led by sizable increases
in shipments of metalworking machinery and turbines. Although some of these
shipments likely went abroad, capital goods imports have also increased, and we
now estimate that real domestic expenditures in this category grew moderately
in the third quarter.
Nonresidential structures. Spending on nonresidential construction--one of
the few areas of weakness so far this year--continued to slow in September, with
nominal outlays for private buildings declining 0.4 percent. For the third
quarter as a whole, expenditures on nonresidential structures were 1-1/4 percent
below the second-quarter average." This decline was driven by reduced
institutional and industrial construction and weakness in other commercial
construction, which includes stores and warehouses. In contrast, construction of
office buildings stayed on its solid uptrend, expanding at a 5-1/2 percent pace in
the third quarter.
Despite an 11-1/2 percent rise in September, contracts for private nonresidential
construction decreased 10-1/4 percent in the third quarter as a whole, reflecting
continued pronounced weakness in industrial building and faster declines in
contracting for several types of construction, including office buildings, other
commercial structures, and lodging and miscellaneous buildings. Note,
however, that contracts data are both highly erratic and subject to large
revisions.
Business Inventories
Data on factory and wholesale inventories received since the release of the
advance GDP report have been considerably higher than the BEA had
anticipated. A literal translation would suggest that real nonfarm inventories
increased at an annual rate of $40 billion, or 3-1/4 percent, in the third quarter,
9. Nonetheless, the estimate for the third quarter was higher than the BEA had assumed in
the advance GDP release and implies an upward revision of almost $2 billion to the third-quarter
GDP estimate of real outlays.

versus the $32 billion estimated in the advance report. Coming on the heels of a
very small accumulation in the second quarter, this increase would contribute
more than 1 percentage point to the increase in real GDP in the third quarter.
Final sales increased at a robust pace last quarter, and the real inventory-sales
ratio edged down to its lowest level in two years.
Inventory investment by manufacturers appears to have turned slightly positive
last quarter: In real terms, we estimate that manufacturers accumulated
inventories at an annual pace of about $3 billion after having liquidated stocks at
about an $8 billion rate in the second quarter. The book value of inventories,
boosted by higher prices, particularly for petroleum and related products,
increased at an annual rate of about $10-1/2 billion in the third quarter after
having declined at an $8 billion average pace over the first half of the year. This
accumulation was held down by the aircraft industry, in which stocks have been
declining with the reduced production at Boeing. As the pace of book-value
stockbuilding for manufacturing as a whole did not keep up with the nominal
value of shipments, the inventory-sales ratio declined in the third quarter. In
October, the NAPM survey of manufacturers showed a net positive diffusion
index for materials inventories, the first this year. Among the purchasing
managers surveyed in September, 38 percent had indicated that they intended to
build some types of inventories because of supply concerns related to Y2K, and
we suspect that any such accumulation will begin to be evident in the October
data. Outside of manufacturing, however, purchasing managers did not indicate
any overall pickup in the pace of inventory investment in October.
We estimate that real wholesale inventories posted a $20 billion accumulation
last quarter (versus the $14 billion figure published in the advance GDP
release). In book-value terms, with sales at wholesalers picking up as well in
the third quarter, the inventory-sales ratio for this category remained about
unchanged. Although most of last year's bulge in the ratio has now been
reversed, stocks remain somewhat elevated relative to sales at distributors of
chemicals, machinery, and metals and minerals.
The BEA reported that real retail inventories increased at an annual rate of
$17 billion in the third quarter, up from the $6 billion pace posted in the second
quarter; the increase was led by a pickup in inventory investment at motor
vehicle dealerships. The BEA's estimates for the non-motor-vehicle portion of
retail inventories are based on book-value data through August and an
assumption of $21-1/2 billion for the September figure, which will be released
next week. Excluding motor vehicles, the average increase in book-value stocks
in July and August was $10-1/2 billion (annual rate), about the same as the rate
of accumulation posted in the second quarter. This moderate pace of book-

value stockbuilding has kept the inventory-sales ratio for this category flat for

Government Expenditures
The federal government recorded a unified budget surplus of $123 billion for
fiscal year 1999, up about $54 billion from last year. The surpluses recorded
over the past two years are the largest as a share of GDP in more than a half-
century. Furthermore, even excluding social security and the Postal Service,
the fiscal 1999 budget was almost in balance, with an on-budget deficit of only
$1 billion. The improved surplus owed in part to a decline in net interest
payments that reflected both lower interest rates and lower debt levels. In
addition, Medicare expenditures were held down by cuts enacted in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Finally, receipts grew faster than nominal GDP
for all major tax categories other than the corporate income tax.
The surplus in September--adjusted for timing shifts and asset transactions--was
$20 billion larger than last September. Receipts were almost 11 percent higher
this September than last, reflecting strong growth in all categories. Adjusted
outlays this September were a bit lower than they were a year earlier. Net
interest payments, national defense expenditures, income security expenditures,
and "other" expenditures were below last year's level, while Medicare spending
growth remained subdued. Medicaid and other health spending picked up
somewhat in September.
The process of enacting the appropriations bills that fund discretionary spending
is moving toward completion. The Congress has passed all thirteen of the
regular appropriations bills that fund discretionary spending programs, but the
President has signed only eight of these bills and has vetoed or threatened to
veto the remaining five. While congressional and Administration negotiators
have reported progress in their efforts to reconcile differences about these bills,
they appear to have given up on their most recent, November 10, target for
completing the bills. They have passed another continuing resolution that will
fund affected programs at current levels through November 17.
The CBO has estimated that the provisions of the bills that have been passed by
Congress would decrease its July baseline surplus projection for fiscal 2000 by
about $32 billion, leaving a projected $17 billion on-budget deficit. Of course,
these numbers may be altered by the congressional-Administration negotiations
now in progress. But the net changes are expected to be small because the
Administration and the Congress are not that far apart on spending levels and
because the negotiators have agreed to provide offsetting spending cuts for any
proposed increases.

On a NIPA basis, real federal purchases increased at an annual rate of
3.1 percent in the third quarter. Real defense consumption and gross investment
grew about 10 percent after three quarters of decline; a large part of the increase
should be attributed to the underlying volatility of defense spending. Real
nondefense consumption and gross investment, on the other hand, fell 8 percent
in the third quarter, owing to a reduction in NASA expenditures for research and
development, which had surged in the second quarter.
According to the BEA's advance estimate, real spending on consumption and
investment goods by state and local governments rose at an annual rate of
3.4 percent in the third quarter, about the same as the average increase now
estimated for the past few years. Moreover, the construction data for September
were considerably stronger than the BEA had anticipated, owing in large part to
a surge in highway spending. In October, state and local employment rose
53,000, more than offsetting the previous month's small dip. So far this year,
employment growth has been somewhat above last year's pace, in part because
of more rapid local-education hiring to accommodate smaller class sizes and
rising enrollments.
Prices and Labor Costs
Prices. The underlying pace of price increases has remained subdued outside of
the energy sector. The consumer price index increased 0.4 percent in
September, boosted by another large increase in energy prices. Excluding food
and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in September, reflecting a large increase in
tobacco prices that added about 0.1 percentage point to both overall and core
inflation in September. Over the twelve months ended in September, the overall
CPI increased 2.6 percent, up from a 1.5 percent increase in the year-earlier
period. In contrast, excluding food and energy, the CPI increased just 2 percent,
about 1/2 percentage point less than in the year-earlier period.
In September, the CPI for energy increased 1.7 percent, the third large monthly
increase in a row. The surge in energy prices over the summer was largely the
result of higher crude oil prices. So far this year, retail energy prices have risen
at an annual rate of 16 percent, compared with a 9 percent decline last year.
Food prices increased 0.2 percent in September and have risen 2.2 percent over
the past twelve months, similar to the increase in the CPI excluding food and
energy.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI was boosted in September by increases in
several of its more erratic components. Most important, tobacco prices jumped
6.5 percent, suggesting that almost all of the increase in wholesale prices that
was announced in September was quickly passed through to retail prices.

Moreover, BLS analysts believe that the large price increases for apparel and
lodging away from home reflected seasonal adjustment difficulties: For apparel,
the increase can be traced largely to the earlier-than-usual introduction of new,
fall-season clothing items. For lodging away from home, the September jump
reflects less-pronounced seasonal variation in summer-resort room rates in the
past couple of years; this caused the CPI's seasonal factors to anticipate a larger
drop in room rates than actually occurred in September.10 In addition, prices of
used cars posted their sixth consecutive large increase; this surge followed a
decline earlier in the year, and, on balance, used car prices were up 2.5 percent
over the past twelve months. In contrast, prices of new vehicles increased just
0.2 percent in September and have fallen 0.5 percent over the past twelve
months.
The CPI's largest single component, owners' equivalent rent, increased
0.2 percent in September. So far this year, owners' equivalent rent has risen at
an annual rate of 2.2 percent, down from a 3.2 percent increase over the twelve
months of 1998. This deceleration has occurred even though, as noted earlier,
single-family home prices have been rising more rapidly. Owners' equivalent
rent in the CPI is intended to be a proxy for the cost of homeownership; it is
based on movements in market rents, with more weight placed on geographic
areas that have a high concentration of owner-occupied homes. Thus, one
explanation that has been proposed for the relatively sluggish performance of
owners' equivalent rent relative to house prices--assuming that it is not a
statistical aberration--is that the demand for housing has shifted from renting to
owning, pushing house prices up and rents down. Similarly, the fact that the
CPI for tenants' rent has not decelerated as much as has owners' equivalent rent
so far this year suggests that, within the rental market, demand has been weakest
in areas dominated by owner-occupied homes. Consistent with this hypothesis,
the rental vacancy rate for single-family homes has been drifting up in recent
years at the same time that the vacancy rate for units in multifamily buildings
has been moving down.
The PCE chain price index provides an alternative perspective on consumer
price inflation. Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 1999, the
PCE chain price index increased 1.7 percent, up from a 1 percent increase over
10. In addition, the seasonality of the indexes for both apparel and lodging away from home
appears to have been changed by the adoption in January of the geometric-means formula for
aggregating individual price quotes to form the CPIs for narrow categories. Our estimates
suggest that this change led to some overstatement in the September increases in these two
categories, after some understatement in the preceding three months. Note that while the effect
of changed seasonality on these categories was large in September--on the order of
1/2 percentage point each--the effect on the core CPI came to only about 0.05 percentage point.

the preceding four quarters. Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index
increased 1.3 percent, unchanged from the preceding four-quarter period. The
lack of deceleration in core PCE prices even as the core CPI has decelerated
further owes, in part, to the fact that housing prices have a much larger weight in
the CPI than in the PCE price index."
The producer price index for capital equipment rose 0.3 percent in October after
a 0.2 percent increase in September. The increases in both months were boosted
by large increases in prices of light motor vehicles. The September increase
likely reflected the fact that, with stocks lean, manufacturers had less need than
usual to cut prices in order to clear out 1999 models; this atypical behavior was
translated by the seasonal factors into a large increase.12 In addition, computer
prices fell 0.5 percent in September and 1.3 percent in October, a slower pace of
decline than had been posted earlier in the year. These smaller declines reflect
disruptions in the supply of components, especially memory chips.
Combining consumer and investment prices, as well as prices from the
government sector, the price index for gross domestic purchases rose at an
annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter; over the past four quarters, this
measure was up 1-1/2 percent, about 3/4 percentage point more than its pace
over the preceding four quarters. As noted above, resurgent energy prices
accounted for most of the higher inflation this year. The price index for gross
domestic product, which measures prices of goods produced in the United States
and thus has a smaller weight on energy prices, increased 1-1/4 percent over the
past four quarters, up just slightly from the year-earlier period.
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for intermediate materials excluding
food and energy moved up 0.4 percent in October after a 0.1 percent uptick in
September. Together, these increases are close to the average for the prior
several months. Some of these increases--for example, for certain chemicals
and plastics--reflect higher oil prices. But many metals prices also have been
increasing rapidly. Higher prices for forest products boosted the materials PPI
in the spring and early summer, but this component has posted declines more
recently; indeed, spot prices of these commodities have almost entirely
unwound their earlier run-up. Since it began turning up early last spring, the
11. A more complete explanation of the difference between these price measures must
await publication of the NIPA detail.
12. As is often the case, the September rise in the PPI for cars was not mirrored in the
September CPI. In this instance, the increase may have been muted because the CPI phases in
the model-year changeover over several months, whereas in the PPI, the old models are removed
abruptly in September, exaggerating the effects of any special end-of-model-year pricing in the
September PPI.

PPI for core intermediate materials has fully retraced the 1-1/2 percent decline it
posted over the preceding twelve months. Looking at prices at even earlier
stages of production, the PPI for crude materials other than food and energy rose
2.4 percent in October and 2.2 percent in September, suggesting that there are
further materials price increases in the pipeline. Since they began turning up in
May, prices of core crude materials have increased nearly 12 percent (not at an
annual rate), after having declined 12-1/2 percent over the preceding twelve
months.
Mean one-year-ahead inflation expectations as captured by the Michigan SRC
moved up 1/4 percentage point in October to 3-1/2 percent. While the mean
expectation measure is quite erratic from month to month, the smoother median
household expectation rose by a similar amount last month, to about 3 percent.
On a three-month moving-average basis, household inflation expectations are
about 1/2 percentage point higher than at the end of last year; this uptick mirrors
the rise in overall inflation over this period. Looking further ahead, household
expectations of inflation over the next five to ten years have been little changed
since the end of last year, with a mean response of 3-1/4 percent and a median
response of 2-3/4 percent in October.
Labor costs. Compensation costs have been rising more slowly than they did
last year, but there are signs that this deceleration is coming to a close. The
employment cost index for hourly compensation in private industry increased at
an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the three months ended in September, a bit faster
than the average pace in the first six months of the year. Over the twelve
months ended in September, hourly compensation increased 3.1 percent, down
from a 3.8 percent increase over the preceding twelve-month period. The
deceleration occurred in the services, trade, and transportation industries, but
was most marked in the finance, insurance, and real estate industry. There,
some slowing of increases in equity prices and home sales, and the sharp drop in
mortgage refinancing activity likely contributed to slower increases in
commissions. However, the rate of increase in hourly compensation was
unchanged in manufacturing and has moved up notably in the construction
industry.
The deceleration in hourly compensation occurred entirely in wages and
salaries, which increased 3.2 percent over the twelve months ended in
September, about a percentage point less than in the preceding twelve-month
period. By contrast, hourly benefits increased 2.8 percent over the latest twelve-
month period, 0.2 percentage point more than in the preceding period. Health
insurance costs have accelerated sharply in the past year, from a 2.2 percent
increase in the year-ago period to a 5 percent increase over the most recent
twelve months. According to unpublished and confidential detail on benefit

costs, ongoing declines in employer costs of workers' compensation insurance
and unemployment insurance are now less rapid. However, nonproduction
bonuses have swung from a substantial increase in the period ending a year ago
to a substantial decline in the latest period.
Based on the national accounts data, we estimate that hourly compensation as
captured by the Productivity and Cost series will be reported on Friday to have
risen at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 percent in the third quarter. In addition,
the new national accounts data point to a small downward revision to the
increase in hourly compensation in the first half of the year to an annual rate of
about 4-1/2 percent; the new data also point to a large upward revision to the
estimated change in hourly compensation in 1998, to about a 5 percent increase
on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis. With these revised data, the
Productivity and Cost series will, like the ECI, show a deceleration in
compensation costs this year, albeit to a much higher rate of increase than in the
ECI. We think that at least part of this higher rate in the Productivity and Cost
series owes to the fact that this measure includes an estimate of the net proceeds
of employee stock-option realizations, which have been rising rapidly in recent
years and are included in this measure but not in the ECI.
Our only datum on fourth-quarter wages is the October figure for average hourly
earnings, which increased just 0.1 percent after a 0.5 percent increase in
September. Over the twelve months ended in October, average hourly earnings
increased 3.6 percent, down 1/4 percentage point from the year-earlier period.

Appendix
Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts
The comprehensive revision of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)
released on October 28 included both conceptual changes in how components are
defined and statistical changes in how components are measured. Among the
conceptual revisions, the most important included the recognition of software acquired
by business and government as a capitalized asset in the accounts rather than a current
expense. In addition, government-employee pension plans are now treated like private
pension plans.1 Among the statistical revisions, the BEA has now incorporated into
PCE prices the current-methods CPIs that take account of technical changes--most
notably the introduction of the geometric-means aggregation formula--back to 1978;
previously, such CPI series were used only back to 1995. In addition, the BEA has
introduced a new measure of the real value of unpriced bank services, based on a BLS
output index that is derived from measures of bank activity such as checks cleared,
ATM transactions, and loan activity. Finally, the BEA has incorporated new source
data from a plethora of sources.2 These new source data include items generally
incorporated only with comprehensive revisions, most notably the 1992 input-output
tables, and selected data from the 1997 economic censuses.3 The data for the more
recent years were also affected by items that generally are incorporated in the NIPA at
the time of the regular annual revisions.4
1. Other conceptual revisions to the accounts included modifying the treatment of private
non-insured pension plans, reclassifying certain transactions in the accounts as capital transfers,
redefining the value of imputed services of mutual funds, reclassifying several government tax
and transfer programs, reclassifying as financial transactions the implicit subsidies associated
with federal direct loan housing programs, and reclassifying directors' fees. In addition, the
BEA extended back to 1946 a redefinition of dividend payments by regulated investment
companies that excluded distributions reflecting capital gains distributions. In a prior revision,
the BEA had made this adjustment back to 1982.
2. Other statistical changes included improving the price estimates for private higher
education, improving the methods used to convert tax return data to a NIPA basis, and
improving the estimates of farm proprietor's income. In addition, the BEA announced that they
will begin using an industry-based price measure to deflate output in the nonfinancial corporate
sector. However, the BEA does not intend to implement this change until next March.
3. Specifically, the BEA incorporated data from the 1997 Censuses of Wholesale and Retail
Trade, as well as data on computer shipments from the 1997 Census of Manufactures. In some
comprehensive revisions, the BEA has been able to incorporate more data from the latest
quinquennial economic censuses. However, this comprehensive revision was completed less
than four years after the January 1996 revision, and not all of the data from the 1997 censuses
are available yet.
4. These data include such sources as BLS tabulations of wages and salaries for 1997 and
1998, IRS tabulations of business tax returns for 1997, revised data for 1996 to 1998 from the
international transactions accounts, and data from the Census Bureau on construction put-in-
place for 1997 and 1998 and on state and local receipts and expenditures for fiscal years 1997
and 1998.

Revisions to Real GDP and Major Components
The revisions had little effect, on balance, on average real GDP growth from 1960 to
1980 (upper panel of chart A-1). But over the period from 1980 to 1990, real GDP
growth was revised up 0.4 percentage point per year. Output growth was revised up a
similar amount in the 1990s, though the revision was somewhat larger in the first half
of the decade.5
The revisions to growth in real GDP for the past decade reflected changes in several
components. The rate of increase in real consumer spending was revised up
0.4 percentage point in the first half of the 1990s and 0.1 percentage point in the more
recent period. These revisions largely reflected the switch to the new measure of
unpriced bank services, which has grown faster than the BEA's old index for this
category, and, before 1995, the use of the current-methods CPIs. The average growth
rates of both real business fixed investment and government spending were also revised
up this decade, primarily owing to the new accounting for software. Finally, the rate of
increase in the GDP chain price index was revised down in the first part of the 1990s,
largely reflecting the backward extension of current-methods CPIs.
Software
One of the most important aspects of this comprehensive revision is the incorporation
of computer software into the accounts. The BEA's new estimates for software
investment cover three categories: prepackaged software, which is purchased off the
shelf and includes much PC software, as well as complicated but ready-to-go business
software packages; custom software, which is acquired when people outside the
company or government are hired to write custom programs; and own-account
software, which refers to programs that a business or government develops in-house.
For prepackaged and custom software, the BEA estimates current-dollar values based
on revenues of software providers. The BEA has no direct data on own-account
software production and so measures the output of this software using data on inputs.6
According to the BEA's estimates, business and government investment in these three
types of software in 1998 totaled $159 billion in current dollars, amounting to
1.8 percent of nominal GDP. The business portion accounts for three-fourths of this
total.
Within the business sector, real investment in software has increased at a double-digit
pace since the late 1980s. Through 1995, business investment in software contributed
0.1 percentage point per year to growth in real GDP. These contributions are small
because, even though growth rates of business software were generally high in this
5. For real GDP growth, the revision shown for 1990:Q2 through 1995:Q2 in the lower
panel of chart A-l is 0.5 percentage point, while the bar chart in the upper panel implies a
revision of 0.6 percentage point. The discrepancy reflects rounding.
6. For the most recent period, BEA uses a variety of extrapolators for software. For
current-dollar purchases of custom and prepackaged software by business and government, total
wages for the computer programming services and prepackaged software industries are used as
extrapolators. For current-dollar own-account production of software, the BEA uses recent
trends in purchases of computer hardware to extrapolate the software figures.

period, the share of software in GDP was still relatively small. As software investment
continued to rise rapidly, its contribution stepped up to 0.2 percentage point in the late
1990s.
The BEA also developed new indexes of software prices. For prepackaged software,
the BEA linked together various price indexes from different sources covering different
periods, including matched-model indexes, hedonic indexes, and for the most recent
period, the PPI for software. According to the BEA's estimates, prices of prepackaged
software have fallen at a sizable clip, although less rapidly than prices of computer
hardware. For own-account software, the BEA has no direct information on prices. In
lieu of price data, they assume that prices rise with the cost of inputs and therefore
increase in line with rising wages and other input costs. This assumption implies zero
productivity growth in the production of own-account software, a proposition that
seems difficult to support. Price changes for custom software are assumed to be a
weighted average of price changes for prepackaged and own-account software.7 For
total business software, the BEA takes a weighted average of the indexes for each of
the three types of software; this broad measure of software prices is estimated to have
fallen slowly since the mid-1980s.
Income-Side Revisions
The income side of the accounts also was revised. Starting with the gap between the
product- and income-side measures of output, the statistical discrepancy was revised up
substantially in the middle of the 1990s and is now positive through 1996. However,
starting in 1997, the discrepancy falls more sharply than previously reported, and, by
the beginning of this year, it is just as negative as in the previous figures. As of the
second quarter, the income side of the accounts is 1-1/2 percent larger than the product
side.
As for the relative growth rates of output measured on the product side and income
side, real GDI increased 0.3 percentage point faster per year than real GDP from 1992
to 1996. In the more recent period from the end of 1996 to the middle of this year, the
gap is larger, with real GDI increasing 0.7 percentage point faster than real GDP.
Elsewhere on the income side, the personal saving rate was revised up 2-1/2 percentage
points, on average, from 1987 to 1998. About 2 percentage points of this revision owe
to the reclassification of government pension plans, which shifted the saving of the
7. To estimate custom software prices, BEA places a 75 percent weight on own-account
software and a 25 percent weight on prepackaged software. BEA indicated that these weights
are not data based, but rather were chosen judgmentally.

plans from the government sector to the household sector.8 In addition, data from the
unemployment insurance system led to a large upward revision to wages and salaries in
1998, which boosted the saving rate about 1/2 percentage point further last year.
Despite the revisions, the downward trajectory of the saving rate has not changed
much, and the new path remains consistent with our estimates of wealth effects.
The national saving rate was also revised up, but for a different reason than the
personal saving rate.9 National saving includes business and government saving, as
well as personal saving. Thus, a reclassification of government pension plans--that just
shifts saving from the government to household sector--does not affect national saving.
However, because the BEA now recognizes software as investment, there is an
associated increase in economic profits and depreciation allowances, which boosts
business and government saving.
Although the overall profit share was not revised much, there were noticeable--but
largely offsetting--revisions to the components of profits. Domestic financial profits
were revised up considerably, largely reflecting a change in the accounting for
uninsured private pension plans that boosted financial profits while reducing imputed
interest paid by business to persons by an offsetting amount. Also, new source data
indicate that domestic profits previously were overstated because of an incorrect
allocation of legal and other expenses that support foreign operations of U.S. firms.
This factor led to a downward revision to nonfinancial profits; however, it does not
boost rest-of-world profits because the BEA uses different source data for rest-of-world
profits than for these allocated expenses. Finally, the BEA's recognition of software as
a capitalized asset led to an upward revision to profits. Previously, outlays for software
were treated as expenses; because these expenditures are now capitalized, they are no
longer deducted from profits. This boost to profits is partly offset by a larger deduction
for consumption of fixed capital because, with software added, the capital stock is
larger.
Productivity
The BLS will publish new productivity figures incorporating the NIPA revisions on
November 12. Based on staff estimates, the revised productivity figures will show a
steeper upward trajectory for productivity, particularly in recent years.10 In terms of
growth rates, the new data for the nonfarm business sector suggest little revision to
8. Employer and employee contributions to these plans are now counted as personal income,
as are dividends and interest generated by these plans. Benefits paid are now considered a
transfer within the household sector. Thus, the net saving of these plans--contributions plus
dividend and interest income less benefits paid and administrative expenses--is now recorded in
the household sector. Previously, contributions to these plans were counted as contributions to
social insurance plans, and benefits were recorded as government transfers; therefore the net
saving of these plans accrued in the government sector.
9. Net foreign investment was revised up just a touch in each year since 1982; that is, net
foreign investment is a little less negative than in the previous numbers.
10. All of the numbers in the text and the chart are shown on a methodologically consistent
basis. For the current numbers, the staff makes adjustments to figures before 1978; for the
previously published numbers, the staff makes adjustments to figures before 1995.

productivity growth in the 1980s (lower panel of chart A-4). For the early 1990s, the
new numbers have eliminated the previously evident slowdown in productivity growth
in the first half of this decade. As for a possible shift in underlying productivity growth
rates around 1995, the current figures indicate a sizable step-up in productivity growth
around that time, as did the previously published figures. For the last couple of years,
these product-side data provide less evidence for a further acceleration in productivity
than was evident in the previous data: The current data show a 0.3 percentage point
pickup in productivity growth at the end of 1997, while the previous data showed a
larger 0.5 percentage point step-up.
However, the nonfarm productivity numbers are measured on the product side, and
evidence from the income side tells a different story for the late 1990s. Just as real
GDI increased more rapidly than real GDP in the past couple of years, productivity
measured on the income side has also increased more rapidly in recent years than
productivity measured on the product side. In particular, the latest estimates for the
nonfinancial corporate sector--which are measured on the income side--point to a
sizable further pickup in productivity growth in the late 1990s, and the step-up is
somewhat greater than that in the previously reported data.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Immediately after the last FOMC meeting, Treasury yields rose somewhat in
response to the announcement of a tightening bias in the policy directive. The
news in the early part of the intermeeting period heightened inflation fears, and
talk of the Fed falling behind the inflation-fighting curve became more common.
But recent news on wages has calmed market concerns and diminished
anticipations of a November hike in the funds rate; futures quotes suggest that
market participants now see a little less than even odds of a tightening at the
upcoming meeting. In these circumstances, a rally has moved long-term
Treasury yields from two-year highs back to about where they were at the
beginning of October. Measures of year-end financing pressures such as spreads
and forward rate premiums have narrowed in recent weeks, though in general
they remain elevated.
Equity markets have displayed considerable volatility in recent weeks. Major
share price indexes dropped sharply in response to the higher-than-expected
September PPI report and comments by the Chairman on financial risk and
equity premiums. However, equity markets quickly recovered in conjunction
with falling Treasury yields and strong earnings reports, leaving the indexes
2 to 12 percent higher, on.net, over the intermeeting period.
The third-quarter data show another sizable increase in nonfederal debt, but
there are some signs that businesses and households have begun to trim their
borrowing. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial businesses thus far in the
fourth quarter has been considerably below its third-quarter pace. Although
household debt growth in the third quarter remained near its first-half pace,
indicators of mortgage activity have moved down. In addition, the results of the
latest Senior Loan Officer Survey suggest that demands for both mortgage and
consumer credit have slackened in the current quarter.
Year-End Financing Pressures
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has implemented several initiatives
since the October FOMC meeting to address concerns about the liquidity of
short-term financing markets around year-end. As previously approved, the
Desk began executing repurchase agreements using a tri-party agent, enabling it
to take mortgage-backed agency securities, and it extended the maturity of some
of its repurchase agreements over the year-end. It also began issuing options on
repurchase agreements. A total of $186 billion of options were sold at the first
three auctions, and four additional auctions are now scheduled--two more than
first announced. Demand for the options has been strong, as total bids have
exceeded the amounts auctioned by a wide margin--and the amounts auctioned
themselves have been increased substantially relative to the initial schedule. In

addition, both the volume of bids and the realized prices for the options have
generally increased with each subsequent auction. Apparently, dealers and their
customers, notably Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, consider these options to be
relatively inexpensive insurance against the small probability of a disruption in
access to financing around year-end.
In the first few weeks after the Special Liquidity Facility opened on October 1,
there were some small borrowings that were mostly system tests. But in recent
weeks, two credit unions tapped the SLF to fund unusual loan demand and
currency shipments, and one bank turned to the SLF to re-lend in the funds
market in response to a spike in the federal funds rate.
Measures of year-end pressures in financing have eased some over recent weeks,
though they remain high. The Eurodollar deposit butterfly spread narrowed as
the two-month deposit crossed over the year-end. A similar measure derived
from Libor futures contracts has also narrowed, although it has been quite
volatile. Swap and agency spreads have continued to shrink over the
intermeeting period, and forward rate premiums derived from term federal funds
transactions and commercial paper have also declined. The narrower spreads
and forward rate premiums are attributable in part to a favorable reception to the
repurchase auctions and other Federal Reserve actions, the resolution of some
uncertainty as more firms line up financing across the year-end, and subdued
credit demand as year-end approaches. The November Senior Loan Officer
Survey indicates that although most banks were willing to extend year 2000
contingency lines to existing customers, demand for these lines has been light.
Firms have shifted the maturity of their commercial paper funding to avoid any
potential disruptions caused by computer failure, or by illiquidity in the markets
related to the fears of such failures. Issuers have very little paper maturing in the
last week of December and the first two weeks of January. About 40 percent of
outstandings have been placed beyond the first two weeks of January, roughly
twice the proportion at the same point in recent years. Premiums for funding
across year-end are significantly higher than last year, although they have drifted
down over recent weeks.
In longer-term markets, issuers of highly rated instruments--such as issuers of
investment-grade corporate, commercial-mortgage-backed, and asset-backed
securities--seem less hesitant to tap the markets before year-end, although many
have already taken care of their expected financing needs and plan to enter the
market only opportunistically. Investors have shied away from offerings by
lower-quality and smaller issuers, and these firms largely continue to stay away
from the bond market.

Finally, the public's demand for currency in recent months has been in line with
last year's briskly rising levels, but depository institutions have built up their
vault cash appreciably in anticipation of much stronger demand with the
approach of year-end.
Business Finance
With nearly 90 percent of the S&P 500 now having reported third-quarter
earnings, we estimate that firms in the index posted a robust 22 percent gain in
earnings per share from the year-earlier level. Some of this rapid year-over-year
growth reflected weak earnings for financial and petroleum-related firms in the
third quarter of last year, but other nonfinancial businesses also saw profits jump
substantially. Indeed, earnings of technology firms and auto manufacturers were
up more than 40 percent from the year-earlier level.
As noted, broad indexes of equity prices all moved higher over the intermeeting
period. Most notable was the performance of technology firms; the Nasdaq
composite soared in recent days past its previous all-time high. An index of
Internet firms also reached a new high. Share prices of financial firms were
boosted by the expected salutary effect of financial reform legislation.
Corporate credit quality decreased slightly in the third quarter, with the
deterioration primarily concentrated in below-investment-grade firms. Moody's
Watchlist showed little change, with downgrades slightly exceeding upgrades.
The business failure rate has increased a bit but remains close to the lows of the
current expansion. However, the annual default rate for junk bonds approached
5 percent during the year ended in October, the highest since 1992, and defaults
have occurred across a broad range of industries. Default rates are likely to
increase further, reflecting the seasoning effect from the strong pace of issuance
through the middle of this year, as well as rising riskiness as indicated by higher
debt-to-asset ratios and asset price volatility.
M&A activity among nonfinancial firms eased off a bit in the third quarter from
the torrid pace seen during the first half of the year. Nevertheless, mergers
financed with cash payments--rather than with stock--led to equity retirements of
almost $39 billion in the third quarter, well above the pace in the first half. In
addition, new merger announcements in the third quarter boosted the list of
pending deals to roughly $850 billion, a record level, suggesting that financing
needs should remain substantial in coming quarters. In contrast, share
repurchases have moderated. Actual repurchases in the second quarter declined
slightly, and announcements of new share repurchase programs dropped again in
the third quarter to about $16 billion, the lowest reading since 1995; the rise in
interest rates may have made using cash or borrowing to repurchase shares less
attractive.

Gross offerings of bonds by nonfinancial firms declined in October, as higher
interest rates over much of the month apparently discouraged issuers. Investors'
preference for liquidity was evident, as big issues were well received, while
smaller, less-liquid issues met with resistance. Even so, investment-grade
offerings declined, despite being propped up by financing needs for merger
deals, and below-investment-grade offerings fell well below the pace of the past
few years. As rates and Y2K concerns eased, offerings picked up in the first
week of November, including for high-yield firms, but investors still showed a
preference for larger issues. Net issuance of commercial paper was strong in
October, partly reflecting the deferral of bond offerings, but growth of business
loans at banks slackened substantially from its third-quarter pace.
Equity offerings by nonfinancial corporations were strong in October and early
November, extending the rebound that began in the latter part of September.
Gross issuance in October was over $9 billion, and was almost exclusively by
Internet or other computer-related companies. Early November issuance has
already surpassed $12 billion, including a record $5.5 billion initial public
offering by UPS. The pipeline of new offerings is packed, with almost 200 new
issues waiting to come to market.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Commercial mortgage rates edged up in October and are now about 150 basis
points higher than at the beginning of the year. Probably in response to the
rising rates, the Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that demand for
commercial mortgage loans has leveled off after generally rising over the past
three years. The survey also indicated that, on net, banks have continued to
tighten credit standards for these types of loans.
Gross issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed securities in October totaled
$6 billion, slightly above the average pace during the first three quarters of the
year. Reports indicate that issuance in November and December will taper off
from the October pace but nonetheless will be stronger than previously expected,
largely because of diminished concern over Y2K-related funding difficulties.
Spreads on investment-grade CMBS have remained flat or eased slightly since
the October FOMC meeting.
REIT equity values have remained low, with many now trading at a discount to
the value of their underlying holdings. As a result, REIT issuance of unsecured
debt and equity has stayed low and property acquisitions are down substantially
from recent peaks. A number of REITs have initiated share repurchase
programs in an effort to bolster sagging equity values.

Household Finance
Consumer credit grew at a 6-1/2 percent pace in the third quarter, just under its
pace in the first half of the year. The Senior Loan Officer Survey suggests that
consumer credit growth in the fourth quarter may be subdued: For the first time
in a year, banks, on net, reported weaker demand for consumer loans. There is
some evidence that higher market interest rates are being passed on to
consumers. Rates charged by banks on home equity lines of credit (HELOC)
and new car loans have risen 30 to 50 basis points from their lows earlier this
year. In contrast, interest rates charged by the captive auto finance companies,
which often are held down by credit incentive programs, have not increased in
recent months.
Rising interest rates may have begun to cool the mortgage market last quarter.
Preliminary estimates put mortgage debt growth in the third quarter at about
9 percent, down slightly from the 10 percent rate in the first half of the year.
The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated that demand for home loans continued
to decline in November; the net percentage of banks reporting weaker demand
was the highest since 1995. The four-week moving average of the volatile MBA
mortgage purchase index has been relatively flat in recent weeks and is still
below its recent July peak. Refinancing activity continues its downward trend.
Meanwhile, as rates have risen, households have shifted away from fixed-rate
mortgages and toward adjustable-rate mortgages; indeed, the ARM share of
mortgage originations rose from 11 percent a year ago to 29 percent in
September.
Measures of household credit quality have remained favorable. Moody's index
of credit card delinquencies was up slightly in September but stayed near its
three-year low. Delinquencies at captive auto-finance companies have stayed
near their lowest levels in a decade. Measures of delinquencies on mortgages
purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were unchanged in August at their
four-year lows. The debt-service burden is estimated to have edged up slightly
in the third quarter, reaching roughly 13.2 percent of income--about where it has
been for two years and still a percentage point below the mid-1980s peak. (The
debt-service burden has been recalculated using revised NIPA data.)
The ratio of household net worth to income at the end of the third quarter is
estimated to have declined slightly from its historical high but no doubt has risen
along with the rebound in equity prices thus far in the fourth quarter. In spite of
recent equity price volatility, net new flows to equity funds were steady in
September and October, averaging about $10 billion each month. In contrast, as
interest rates rose, bond funds experienced outflows over both months.

Evidence from 401(k) pension plans paints a more mixed picture. Plan
participants have continued to invest roughly two-thirds of their new
contributions in equity funds or company stock. However, transfers among
existing plan balances in October, which totaled only about 1-1/2 percent of
assets, were pulled mainly from domestic equity funds and company stock and
put into stable-value fixed-income investments, such as money funds and
guaranteed investment contracts.
Government Finance
Treasury and agency. As part of the midquarter refunding announcement, the
Treasury revised its targeted year-end cash balance to $70 billion, down from the
$80 billion announced in the August refunding. The current target is still
substantially larger than usual, owing to Y2K-related concerns. As a result, the
Treasury expects its overall borrowing needs for the current quarter to be
substantial--about $51 billion. However, our own reading of the budget picture
suggests that the cash balance goal can be reached with net borrowing well
under that figure.
In any event, because the Treasury has increased the size of its weekly bill
auctions three times since late September and has experienced continuing
strength in tax revenues, it has sold no cash management bills thus far this
quarter. However, it expects to issue two cash management bills before the end
of the year, both maturing in mid-January. Larger actual and expected supplies
of bills, and perhaps a new Fannie Mae program to issue bill-like securities on
the same schedule as the Treasury, probably account for the upward movement
of bill rates over the intermeeting period, while most other rates were essentially
unchanged.
The Treasury announced several steps designed to improve the liquidity of the
market for its securities in the face of dwindling public debt. One was a new
initiative, a temporary rule that allows the reopening of benchmark Treasury
securities within one year of issuance without regard to the price of the issue
relative to par. Previous rules kept the Treasury from reopening a security when
its price was significantly below par. The new rule makes it easier for the
Treasury to maintain the liquidity of on-the-run issues by systematically adding
to the supply of existing securities--rather than creating smaller (and less liquid)
issues. The Treasury also is going forward with rulemaking that would enable it
to buy back outstanding debt; such buybacks will create additional latitude for
increasing the size of new securities issues--and for reopening recent issues
under the previously noted temporary rules.
The Treasury is selling $25 billion in new five-year notes and reopened ten-year
notes in its quarterly refunding auctions in November, for a net paydown of

$4.3 billion. Government-sponsored enterprises continue to take advantage of
the Treasury's gradual withdrawal from the market, and Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks each issued substantial amounts of their
benchmark debt in the intermeeting period. In addition, Fannie Mae announced
a set of changes for its benchmark notes in order to make the schedule of
issuance more similar to that of the Treasury.
State and local. Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds totaled
$17-1/2 billion in October, about matching the third-quarter rate. Refunding
issuance continued to drop as municipal yields rose to their highest level in three
years. However, this decline was offset by a pickup in new-capital issuance
from the already-strong third-quarter pace.
In October, softening demand and continued strong supply raised the ratio of the
thirty-year revenue bond yield to the thirty-year Treasury yield nearly to its
historic highs. Contributing to the softening demand have been sizable net
outflows from tax-exempt mutual funds for several months. Moreover, property
and casualty insurance companies have pulled back from the muni market, as
falling profits, partly resulting from a storm season that has battered the East
Coast, limited their ability to invest.
The credit quality of municipal issuers continued to improve on balance. In the
third quarter, Standard and Poor's again upgraded more issues than it
downgraded, both in terms of the number of issues and in terms of dollar
volume. Downgrades continue to be concentrated among not-for-profit health
care providers, which are facing revenue pressures due to cuts in government
payments and the expansion of managed care.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 growth continued to be moderate in October, with the 5 percent rate of
advance matching the third-quarter pace. In contrast, M3 growth accelerated to
a 10 percent pace in October, boosted by especially strong increases in large time
deposits and institution-only money funds; the growth in large time deposits was
concentrated in foreign banks, where lending activity increased in October.
Currency growth edged up, moving from an annualized rate of 9-1/2 percent in
September to 10 percent in October.
Growth of adjusted bank credit slowed from a 6-1/2 percent rate in September to
about 4 percent in October. Consumer loans, adjusted for securitizations,
expanded at a solid 12 percent rate, up slightly from the pace in September.
Real estate loans were very strong, partly reflecting a rise in home equity loans
due to a thrift acquisition. Even taking this acquisition into account, however,
growth of real estate loans was rapid, possibly because households' shift toward
ARMs--which banks are more likely to hold in portfolio--has left a greater share

of originations on banks' books. Partly owing to a large bank's sale of its
business loan portfolio to a thrift, which reduced loan growth about
3-1/2 percent, business loans were flat following two months of brisk expansion.
The November Senior Loan Officer Survey indicates that banks further tightened
standards and terms for large and middle-market firms and that the demand for
these loans was roughly unchanged.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The November 1999 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused primarily on changes over the past three months in the supply of and demand
for bank loans to businesses and households. Additional questions addressed Year
2000 (Y2K) issues. Loan officers from fifty-four large domestic banks and twenty U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey. The responses
indicate that banks became more cautious lenders over the past quarter but do not
suggest a widespread reduction in credit availability. Household demand for credit has
reportedly declined, particularly in the mortgage market.
The survey results point to a continued firming of business lending practices. At
domestic banks, the tightening took place predominantly in terms on C&I loans,
particularly risk premiums; a higher net percentage of respondents than in August
reported that they had strengthened underwriting standards as well. The tightening of
both standards and terms on C&I loans was particularly notable at branches and
agencies of foreign banks. A small net fraction of domestic banks and a larger fraction
of branches and agencies of foreign banks raised standards for commercial real estate
loans.
Among domestic banks, there was some evidence of greater willingness to make
consumer installment loans. Very few banks changed their standards or terms on credit
card or other consumer loans, although several banks reported charging higher spreads
over their cost of funds on outstanding credit card balances. For the second
consecutive quarter, a significant fraction of banks reported that demand for home
mortgages weakened, and in November, several banks also reported a modest decrease
in demand for consumer loans.
On Y2K questions, the respondents indicated that demand for contingency lines of
credit remained low. Domestic banks were generally willing to extend such lines, but
often only to existing customers; moreover, the standards and terms for such loans were
usually tighter than those on otherwise similar credit lines. However, banks were not,
in general, tightening terms and standards on renewals of existing lines extending over
year-end. Banks that were limiting credit lines over year-end to specific customer
groups were chiefly concerned about adequately evaluating new customers for Y2K
preparedness and about the possibility of a significant increase in the cost of funding
loans over year-end.
Lending to Businesses
About 9 percent, on net, of domestic bank respondents said that over the past three
months they had tightened standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, up
from 5 percent in August. Among branches and agencies of foreign banks, 30 percent
said that they had tightened, up from 23 percent in August. For the second consecutive
quarter, the survey found virtually no change, on net, in standards on loans to small
businesses.

III-A-2
On C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, an average of 30 percent, on net, of
domestic banks reported tightening risk premiums, costs of credit lines, and spreads of
loan rates over the banks' cost of funds. The net percentage of respondents tightening
these terms to large and middle-market firms has been rising since May. In addition, a
significant number of banks reported charging higher premiums on riskier loans to
small businesses. A substantial fraction of branches and agencies of foreign banks
reported increasing premiums charged on riskier loans and many also indicated
tightening non-price-related terms. As in the August survey, the most commonly cited
reasons for tightening remained a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook,
an expected worsening of industry-specific problems, and a reduced tolerance for risk.
Demand for C&I loans at domestic banks was reported to be essentially unchanged, on
net, for the second consecutive quarter. Similarly, foreign respondents also indicated
virtually no net change in demand. However, 16 percent of large domestic banks and
10 percent of foreign banks stated that demand for C&I loans had been moderately
boosted by the high cost of commercial paper issuance over year-end. Merger and
acquisition financing needs were given as the primary reason for increased demand by
both the domestic banks and foreign branches and agencies that reported higher
demand. Among domestic banks that experienced decreased demand, reduced business
fixed investment was cited as the most common reason.
On net, 11 percent of domestic respondents reported tighter standards on commercial
real estate loans. By contrast, nearly 40 percent of foreign respondents tightened
standards on commercial real estate loans, the same percentage as in August. On net,
domestic bank respondents reported no change in the demand for commercial real
estate loans over the past three months; on the other hand, 20 percent of branch and
agency respondents noted a moderate weakening in demand.
Two special questions addressed changes in terms on commercial real estate loans over
the past nine months. On net, domestic respondents reported that the terms on
commercial real estate loans have been essentially unchanged since February. A
considerable fraction of branches and agencies of foreign banks tightened terms on
commercial real estate loans; in particular, spreads of loan rates over banks' cost of
funds had widened, while maximum loan sizes and loan-to-value ratios had declined.
Lending to Households
On net, 41 percent of senior loan officers reported weaker demand for home mortgage
loans in November, the highest net percentage since mid-1995 and the second
consecutive quarter of weakness in this sector. Even though the question specifically
asks about demand for mortgages for purchasing homes as opposed to refinancing
existing mortgages, respondents reporting a decrease in demand may have been
influenced by the decline in refinancing activity that began earlier in the year.
However, the survey results are broadly consistent with the slowing in residential
housing activity evident since the summer.
The willingness of banks to make consumer installment loans has increased slightly
compared to three months ago. Most standards and terms for both credit card and other

III-A-3
consumer loans remained basically unchanged. However, 13 percent of banks, on net,
reported charging higher spreads over their cost of funds on credit cards, a small
increase from the August survey. Consistent with evidence from the current Beige
Book, there was a turnaround on the demand side: on net, 8 percent of respondents
reported decreased demand for consumer loans, whereas in August, 11 percent had
reported an increase in demand.
Year 2000
The survey results continue to indicate that requests for Y2K contingency lines of
credit have been limited. A relatively small percentage of domestic bank respondents
had received requests for such lines from nonfinancial firms, while 17 percent of banks
had received requests from financial firms. Despite some loan officers in the last
survey noting that more requests might be forthcoming, these percentages are actually
slightly lower than those observed in August. Branches and agencies of foreign banks
were even less likely to have received requests for such lines. Requests for
contingency lines came from many different types of financial firms, with the largest
number of respondents having received requests from other domestic commercial
banks, followed by mutual funds, securities dealers and brokers, and insurance
companies. Several respondents commented that they expect higher utilization of
existing credit lines to fund year-end inventory accumulation and slower collection of
receivables, but that in many cases companies have already extended the maturities of
their lines of credit and so did not need Y2K contingency lines.
On the supply side, only two domestic and four branch and agency respondents were
unwilling to extend Y2K contingency lines of credit. However, nearly two-thirds of
domestic and foreign respondents are limiting Y2K contingency lines of credit to
existing customers, and in many cases such lines are being made available only to their
most creditworthy existing customers. Compared to otherwise similar credit
arrangements (such as with respect to maturity and size), a substantial fraction of large
domestic and foreign respondents reported somewhat more stringent standards and
terms on Y2K contingency lines. The most commonly cited reasons for limiting Y2K
lines to specific customer groups or imposing relatively tight terms on these lines are
concerns about adequate evaluation of new customers and potentially high cost of
funds over year-end. Nonetheless, compared to three months ago, 10 percent of
domestic banks were more willing to extend Y2K contingency financing.
In contrast to the tighter standards and terms for Y2K contingency lines, 77 percent of
the domestic banks surveyed reported no effect on either standards or terms for the
renewal of expiring credit lines that extend over year-end but that are not specifically
meant to meet year-end funding needs. Similarly, 58 percent of branch and agency
respondents, up from 32 percent in August, reported no effect on either standards or
terms. Among domestic banks that are tightening standards or terms on financing that
extends over year-end, a higher percentage than in August stated that advances over
year-end will be priced relative to their own cost of funds rather than independent
indexes (such as LIBOR) and will likely entail a rate premium. The most common
adjustment made by foreign respondents to credit lines that extend over year-end was
to apply tighter credit standards.

IIII-A-4
The respondents that were unwilling to extend Y2K contingency lines of credit, or that
had limited such lines to existing customers, or that had tightened standards or terms on
renewals of existing lines, gave a variety of reasons for their caution. Almost half of
domestic banks cited concerns about adequately evaluating new customers for Y2K
preparedness. In addition, a high percentage of both domestic banks and branches and
agencies of foreign banks expressed concern about the anticipated increased cost of,
and uncertainty surrounding, funding credit extensions over year-end. At both
domestic and foreign banks, concerns about the effect of Y2K-related lending on
capital ratios abated significantly relative to the August survey.

The value of exports jumped 3 3/4 percent in August, owing mainly to a surge in
exports of aircraft and to strong increases in exports of automotive products,
industrial supplies, and agricultural products. The increase in automotive
products was largely parts sent to Canada and Mexico for use in production of
vehicles to be shipped back to the United States. Much of the increase in the
value of industrial supplies was in chemicals, and the rise in the value of
agricultural products was primarily from soybeans (in terms of both price and
quantity). For July-August combined, the value of exports was 3 percent higher
than in the second quarter, with increases posted in most major trade categories,
largely reflecting the strength of the August export values.
The value of imports increased 2 percent in August, largely from oil (primarily
higher prices), industrial supplies, and vehicles from Canada. For July-August
combined at an annual rate, the value of imports was 5 1/4 percent higher than in
the second quarter with large increases in all major trade categories other than
food.

Quantity and price of imported oil. The value of imported oil increased further
in August, reflecting both higher prices and higher quantities. The price of
imported oil rose to over $18.50 per barrel in August, up more than $1.75 per
barrel from July, driven by reduced supplies, primarily from OPEC, and
strengthening world demand. Still, the quantity of imported oil rose slightly due
to higher U.S. consumption.
More recently, oil prices have moderated somewhat as Iraqi exports remain high
and as expectations of higher non-OPEC production have increased. OPEC
compliance with production targets has remained high, which has tended to
support prices. In October, the monthly average spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) declined for the first time in eight months to around $22.50
per barrel from over $23.75 per barrel in September. Spot WTI is currently
trading around $24 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. In the third quarter, non-oil import
prices declined 1/4 percent at an annual rate, reflecting large declines in the prices
of computers and semiconductors. The price of "core" goods imports (excluding
oil, computers, and semiconductors), however, rose 1 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter, the first increase since the fourth quarter of last year. Strong
increases in prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies (particularly lumber)
and a small rise in prices of imported automotive products more than
outweighed declines recorded for prices of imported machinery (other than
computers and semiconductors), foods (especially coffee), and consumer goods.
Prices of non-oil imports increased slightly in October, with prices of core goods
continuing to move up, especially prices for industrial supplies, machinery, and
automotive products.
In the third quarter, export prices increased 1/2 percent at an annual rate, the first
increase recorded since the first quarter of 1997. Prices of "core" goods exports
(which exclude agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors) rose 1 1/2
percent at an annual rate in the third quarter (nearly the same rate of increase as
in Q2), reflecting primarily higher prices for exported industrial supplies with
smaller increases for prices of exported automotive products and consumer
goods. Prices of agricultural products declined 4 1/2 percent in the third quarter
(the smallest quarterly rate of decline since the second quarter of 1997). Prices
of computers and semiconductors fell at an 8 to 10 percent annual rate. Export
prices continued to increase in October, as price increases for core goods were
somewhat offset by declines in prices for agricultural goods. Trade price data
for November will be released on December 9.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
At $104 billion, private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities in the third
quarter totaled just below the record set in the fourth quarter of 1996 (line 4 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Net purchases of
corporate and other bonds accounted for almost 70 percent of the total, with net
stock purchases accounting for most of the rest (lines 4b and 4c). Purchases of
agency bonds comprised about $21 billion of line 4b. As is typical, a large part
of both net corporate bond and stock purchases was transacted through
international financial centers in the third quarter: over $45 billion for the
quarter went through the United Kingdom, with another $6 billion (each) going
through the Caribbean and Japan. Net foreign purchases of Treasury securities
(line 4a) were small and negative in the third quarter except for the month of
August; about half of the $15 billion net in that month was the result of hedge
fund purchases in the Caribbean.
U.S. residents registered modest net purchases of foreign securities in the third
quarter, almost entirely the result of bond purchases (lines 5 and 5a). The
pattern was reversed in September, as there were small net sales of both foreign
bonds and stocks. Much of the August total for net bond purchases was
attributable to U.S. purchases of $4.5 billion of a Daimler-Chrysler flotation.
While overall net stock purchases were minuscule for the quarter (line 5b), U.S.
net purchases of Japanese stocks amounted to almost $9 billion.
Official capital inflows were a net $13 billion in the quarter, although there was
a modest official outflow in September (line 1). The third quarter total was
more than accounted for by increases in Japanese reserves that closely tracked
their intervention activities. Significant reserve increases were also registered
by Germany and Singapore. In September, Argentina's reserves held in the
United States fell substantially.
Capital flows associated with banks during the third quarter were moderate, but
volatile (line 3). A $9 billion net capital outflow to the British West Indies,
associated with the purchases of corporate bonds and stocks noted above,
accounted for almost all of the net banking outflow in the quarter.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The foreign exchange value of the dollar has moved in a narrow range since the
October FOMC meeting, appreciating about 1 percent on net in terms of the
major currencies index, while depreciating 1 percent in terms of the currencies
of our other important trading partners. As a result, the broad trade-weighted
index was little changed on balance. Among major currencies, the dollar's
appreciation against European currencies (2 percent versus sterling, 2 percent
vis-a-vis the euro, and 3 1/2 percent against the Swiss franc) was partially offset by
a 1 1/2 percent depreciation versus the Japanese yen.

During the intermeeting period, financial markets became increasingly focused
on the prospects for monetary policy actions in Europe and in the United States.
In the event, on November 4, the European Central Bank increased its
refinancing rate 50 basis points to 3 percent, and the Bank of England raised its
repurchase rate 25 basis points to 5/2 percent. The moves were generally
expected by market participants. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the
National Bank of Denmark also increased policy rates 25 basis points during the
period.
The euro's weakness versus both the dollar and the yen was somewhat puzzling,
as data continued to point to a robust inflation-free recovery in Europe.
Euro-area 10-year bond yields rose gradually early in the period, then fell sharply
after higher-than-expected monetary growth data solidified expectations of an
ECB rate hike, and continued to decline after the rate hike itself. On net, a

IV-9
20-basis-point overall decline in long yields was paired with a 24-basis-point
increase in 3-month rates. Increased prospects for price stability in the long run,
as well as reduced uncertainty about the path of euro-area monetary policy, were
cited as possible explanations for the unexpected flattening of the yield curve.
The fall in 10-year yields was even more pronounced in the United Kingdom,
where a 51-basis-point fall outstripped a 20-basis-point decline in 3-month
yields. Share prices rose 6 1/2 percent in Germany and 3 percent in the United
Kingdom during the period.

The yen strengthened to its highest level against the dollar since the September
G-7 meeting before retracing some of its gains late in the period. Despite
frequent warnings by Japanese authorities about the excessive strength of the
currency, the Bank of Japan did not intervene in foreign exchange markets. The
yen was supported by continued signs of economic recovery and by reports that
the Japanese government was considering a fiscal package larger than had been
previously expected. Perhaps in reaction to the prospects for increased deficit
spending, 10-year bond yields increased 20 basis points. Japanese share prices
rose 4 1/2 percent.
Latin American financial markets performed well during the intermeeting
period. Equity prices rose more than 16 percent in Mexico and Brazil, and
Brady spreads narrowed substantially for most Latin American issues. The

Mexican peso was little changed. The victory of the opposition candidate in
Argentina's presidential elections had been widely expected and generated little
market reaction. In Brazil, the real came under pressure early in the period
despite continued sales of dollar-indexed debt by the central bank. The real later
recovered after the central bank announced a series of measures designed to
support the currency, including an agreement with the IMF allowing it to spend
additional reserves in intervention operations.
Amid general optimism about the recovery in emerging Asia, several currencies
appreciated during the period. The Korean won gained almost 3 percent, the
Thai baht rose over 3 percent, and the Indonesian rupiah surged 12 percent as a
new administration was elected. Share prices rose in many Asian markets.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data for the foreign industrial countries suggest that economic expansion
continues to gain strength. In Japan, third-quarter production data indicate
continued growth after the surprisingly robust first half However, consumer
spending appears to have slowed in the third quarter, pointing to a mixed overall
picture. Following modest gains in the second quarter, economic activity in the
euro zone appears to have surged in the third quarter, with industrial production,
new orders for manufactured goods, and economic sentiment all pointing up in
most of the region. Activity in the United Kingdom and Canada during the third
quarter appears to have surpassed an already strong second-quarter pace, with
GDP rising sharply in both countries.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued in the foreign industrial countries,
although higher oil prices have contributed to an uptick in headline inflation.
Japanese core consumer prices fell slightly in October from a year earlier, while
wholesale prices continue to decline at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent. Euro-
zone inflation remains modest, with twelve-month inflation around 1 1/4 percent,
primarily reflecting higher energy costs. Canadian core inflation has nudged up
recently, but is still below the midpoint of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent
target. U.K. inflation remains close to 2 percent.
Production indicators for Japan suggest that the economy continued to expand
in the third quarter following a surprisingly strong rebound in the first half of the
year. However, there is as yet no firm evidence that private demand growth in
Japan has become self-sustaining. Industrial production in the third quarter was
nearly 4 percent higher than the second quarter, and the more broadly-based all-
activity index was up a touch more than 1 percent on average in July and August
relative to the second quarter level. Production and shipments of investment
goods posted a particularly large gain in the third quarter, possibly related to
Y2K effects.
Japanese consumer demand has dropped back following strong growth in the
first half of the year, as both real household expenditures and new passenger car
registrations were down somewhat in the third quarter. Housing starts were
down a little in the third quarter as well, albeit to a level still about 7 percent
higher than a year earlier, reflecting the impact of tax and interest rate incentives
that boosted construction earlier this year.
Forward-looking indicators are mixed. Machinery orders appear to have
stabilized in recent months, but are still at a low level. The September Tankan
survey showed a broad improvement in business sentiment across major
categories. However, firms expect to reduce capital expenditures next year by a
much larger amount than this year's decline. They also expect to continue

IV-13
reducing "excessive" employment, consistent with recent announcements of
large-scale restructuring at Nissan and other corporations. While the
unemployment rate has edged down to 4.6 percent in the last few months, the
improvement is widely expected to be short-lived as corporate restructuring
proceeds.

Japan's merchandise trade surplus during the first nine months of 1999 was
$112 billion at an annual rate, up a little from the $108 billion surplus recorded
for 1998. Denominated in dollars, exports during the first nine months rose
about 5 percent from their 1998 averages, while imports were up about 5 1/2
percent. Japanese exports to developing Asia have surged this year, as recovery
in these countries has taken hold, but exports to Europe have declined
significantly from 1998 levels.
Discussions are currently underway over the scale and composition of a second
supplemental budget for the current Japanese fiscal year. Initial statements by
government officials suggested that the package will include fiscal stimulus

IV-14
measures totaling more than 10 trillion yen, with about 5.5 trillion
(approximately 1 percent of GDP) in "real-water" expenditures. However,
recent remarks have indicated that the package, which should be announced later
this month, could be somewhat larger. Current plans call for 3.5 trillion yen for
infrastructure projects and 2 trillion yen to assist small businesses, encourage
home-building and "create jobs".
In the euro area, data on current economic activity as well as recent information
on economic sentiment and new orders indicate that activity picked up sharply
in the third quarter. For the euro area as a whole, industrial production for July
and August on average was about 0.9 percent (s.a.) above the second-quarter
level. In Germany, new orders for manufactured goods surged in August; for the
third quarter as a whole, orders rose 4.9 percent (s.a.) compared to the second
period. Manufacturers' orders--especially from foreigners--have been on a
rising trend for several months. Economic sentiment has been improving in
most of the countries in recent months, with improvement in all components of
the index-industrial, consumer, and construction.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area was unchanged at 10
percent in September. For the third quarter on average, the unemployment rate
was also 10 percent. In France, Germany and Italy, unemployment rates have
declined modestly so far this year, and those in France and Italy remained above
eleven percent in the third quarter.
The euro-area harmonized CPI inflation remained flat at 1.2 percent (year over
year) in September, after having risen steadily but slowly during the summer due
to higher energy prices. Still, consumer price inflation remains considerably
below the ECB's goal of keeping annual inflation below 2 percent. Noticeable
differences in performance persist among individual countries, with inflation
rates in Austria, France and Germany all below 1 percent, while rates in Ireland,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain are a little above 2 percent.

On November 2, French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned
following accusations that he received payment from a student insurance
organization for allegedly billing for legal services he had not performed while
in opposition from 1994 to 1996. Secretary of State for the Budget Christian
Sautter was immediately nominated as his replacement.
At its meeting on November 4, the Governing Council of the European Central
Bank (ECB) raised its official rates by 50 basis points. In a news conference
following the meeting, ECB President Wim Duisenberg said that since early
summer the balance of risks to future price stability had moved towards the
upside, and that the "precautionary interest rate reduction" of 50 basis points
made last April was no longer justified. Although harmonized inflation is
expected to remain below 2 percent in 2000, the Governing Council concluded
that "a timely rise in interest rates will avoid the need for a larger increase in
interest rates later."

Incoming data confirm that economic activity in the United Kingdom continued
to strengthen in the third quarter, with the preliminary estimate of real GDP
registering growth of 3.7 percent (s.a.a.r.). Industrial production increased 1.2
percent over the quarter; the slight drop in September production reflected a
decline in output of utilities industries. Retail sales remained strong: after
registering robust increases in the first half of the year, the volume of sales in the
third quarter increased at its fastest rate in nearly two years. Business
confidence eased somewhat in October but remained well above lows reached
late last year, and business surveys for October point to further expansion in
both the manufacturing and service sectors.

Labor market conditions remained tight in the third quarter. The official claims-
based unemployment rate remained 4.2 percent in September, the lowest rate in
nearly 20 years, and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate
remained 5.9 percent for the June-August period. Average annual earnings
growth was 4.9 percent for the three months centered in August, somewhat
higher than growth recorded in the first half of the year, but still below average
earnings growth recorded through most of 1998. However, business surveys
suggest that wage costs are rising.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
rates) remains comfortably below the official target of 2.5 percent, but producer
input prices have risen noticeably since April.
In its November Inflation Report, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank
of England released its latest GDP and inflation forecasts. Under the
assumption that official interest rates remain unchanged at 5.5 percent, the
forecast for GDP growth is somewhat stronger than at the time of the August
Report, reflecting improved prospects for both domestic demand and net
exports. Over the two-year forecast period, GDP growth is expected to average
between 2 1/2 and 3 percent, somewhat above trend. Inflation is projected to
remain subdued in the near term, dipping to sightly below 2 percent, but is then
projected to increase to about the 2 1/2 percent target level in two years. In the

IV-18
near term, downward pressure on inflation comes from a somewhat stronger
profile for sterling and a reduction in retail price margins; inflationary pressure
is masked somewhat by a price-level effect from utilities price cuts scheduled
for next spring. The pick-up in inflation in the medium term largely reflects the
impact of a higher earnings profile.
Economic activity in Canada gained momentum during the third quarter from
an already strong pace. Monthly real GDP at factor cost rose over 5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in both July and August. Sizeable increases in retail sales suggest that
consumer spending has strengthened, while strong U.S. demand, particularly for
automobiles, has contributed to a booming manufacturing sector. In addition,
continued strength in computer sales and services in July and August indicate
the pace of investment in machinery and equipment remained vigorous.
With growth strengthening, labor market conditions in Canada have
strengthened noticeably in recent months. Employment rose sharply in October
for the second consecutive month. As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 7.2
percent in October, its lowest level since March 1990.
Canada's merchandise trade surplus widened to $2.4 billion in August, its
highest level since December 1996. A vigorous automotive sector led to large
increases in both exports and imports in August. In addition, recovering
commodity prices continued to bolster the value of exports.
Canadian core consumer prices (which exclude food and energy) rose 0.3
percent (s.a.) in September, pushing the twelve-month core inflation rate to 1.8
percent, from 1.6 percent in August. While still comfortably within the Bank of
Canada's 1 to 3 percent target range, core inflation has risen considerably from
its low level at the beginning of the year. Higher energy prices also helped push
the twelve-month change in overall inflation in September to 2.6 percent, its
highest level in over four years.
In the government's fall fiscal update, Finance Minister Paul Martin announced
the federal budget projections for the next five years. Based on the assumption
of no tax or spending changes, the cumulative surplus for the years 2000 to 2005
is projected to be C$95 billion. Mr. Martin also announced that the next budget
(FY2000-01) will contain a multi-year tax cut plan and there will be a reduction
in employment insurance premiums starting on January 1, 2000.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, economic growth in Mexico remains strong. Indications point
to improved performance in Brazil and the latest industrial production data from
Argentina suggest that the recession there may have bottomed out. Venezuela,
however, continues to falter as political uncertainty overshadows the benefits of
higher oil prices. Inflation remains subdued, on balance, across the region,
reflecting low levels of economic activity in Argentina and Venezuela and
relatively tight monetary policy in Mexico. In Brazil, however, price pressures
may be intensifying.
In developing Asia, the economic recovery continues at a rapid pace. Soaring
exports are helping to fuel a possible economic rebound in China and sustaining
high rates of output growth in the ASEAN countries. The exceptions are
Taiwan, where a major earthquake in September disrupted output, and
Indonesia, where internal problems have hindered growth. While deflation
continues a pace in China and the excess capacity in the ASEAN countries is
keeping inflation at bay, rapid growth in Korea is beginning to push prices up.
In Brazil, signs are pointing both to a pickup in economic activity after what
appears to have been a lackluster third quarter and to mounting inflationary
pressures. Rising sales have been reported in several industries over the past
weeks and the unemployment rate, although still elevated, edged lower in
September. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the government-compiled
IPC-A, remained fairly low through the third quarter-rising 5.6 percent from the
same quarter a year ago. However, wholesale price inflation has moved up in
the past few months, reflecting depreciation of the real. More recently, several
producers have announced that they will increase prices, and generous wage
packages in the auto industry have been highly publicized. Brazil's trade deficit
continued to narrow relative to its year-earlier level; the decline mainly reflected
a large fall in imports. Export growth has been weak, due, in part, to a dropoff
in demand from Argentina.
The Brazilian government has continued to record monthly fiscal surpluses and
will exceed its IMF program goal of a primary surplus of 3 1/4 percent of GDP by
end-1999, but this strong performance in part reflects temporary factors. More
troubling for the longer-term state of Brazil's fiscal affairs was the surprise
ruling by the supreme court in mid-October that the government's efforts to tax
benefits of civil service retirees were unconstitutional. Although the immediate
fiscal impact of the ruling was considered small for the federal government, it
posed a greater problem for Brazil's state governments and signaled continued
opposition to social security reform. The federal government quickly took stop-
gap measures to offset the revenue loss and, more importantly, proposed a
constitutional amendment to allow the taxation of civil-servant pensions. The

IV-24
proposed amendment, however, faces opposition from both congress and the
supreme court.

Partly in response to the supreme court's decision, the central bank's monetary
council did not lower the overnight interest rate, the Selic rate, at its October 6
meeting. Instead, a downward bias was introduced and the Selic rate has edged
down slightly since the October meeting. In recent weeks, Brazil's central bank
also has taken action to support the currency, allowing international reserves to
fall $2 billion in October to $40 billion at the end of the month. As reserves
came close to the international reserve floor specified in Brazil's IMF program,
an agreement was reached with the Fund reducing the floor by $2 billion, plus an
extra $1 billion as an offset for an unexpected shortfall in loan disbursements
from multilateral institutions. The central bank also announced in late October
that it would sell about $7 billion worth of dollar-indexed debt in coming weeks,
signaling that the bank would continue to provide securities that permit the
private sector to hedge against a depreciation of the real. Finally, in late October
and early November, the Brazilian government also issued seven-year
Eurobonds worth 700 million euros, partially offsetting earlier losses in foreign
currency reserves.

IV-25
In Mexico, there is continuing evidence of solid growth, driven by rising
domestic demand as well as strong U.S. growth and favorable oil prices.
Although seasonally adjusted industrial production fell slightly in August, the
drop followed a 1 percent rise in July, and the July-August average was up
2.1 percent relative to the second quarter. Moreover, the unemployment rate
declined slightly in the third quarter. Consumer price inflation has trended
downward this year as monetary policy has remained relatively tight; through
October, prices have risen 10 percent, and indications are that annual year-end
inflation for 1999 will probably be fairly close to the government's target of
13 percent. A rapid deceleration in import growth caused the seasonally
adjusted trade deficit to narrow sharply in the third quarter, suggesting that
spending growth may have slowed.

On the financial side, performance has been mixed. After appreciating for much
of the year, the peso depreciated about 2 1/2 percent in October. The Mexican
stock market has displayed considerable volatility in recent months, apparently
reflecting variability in U.S. markets. The benchmark 28-day cetes rate was
about 16 1/2 percent in the latest auction on November 9 and has declined by over
250 basis points in the past month or so, consistent with about a 150 basis point
decline in Brady bond spreads since late September.

IV-26
The ruling PRI party held its first-ever presidential primary on November 7.
Francisco Labastida, a former minister of Interior, won the party nomination,
defeating his closest rival Roberto Madrazo, the former governor of Tabasco, by
a wider margin than expected. After conceding defeat, Madrazo allayed fears
that he would leave the PRI and, for now at least, is taking the posture that he
will work within the party for change. Negotiations between the two major
opposition parties, the PAN and the PRD, about the possibility of putting forth a
joint opposition candidate have broken down.
In Argentina, data released since the last Greenbook provide some hint of a
bottoming out of the recession. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial
production increased 1.5 percent--the first quarterly gain in over a year.
Industrial production only edged off in September, following a big jump in
August. The August trade deficit was $1.4 billion at an seasonally adjusted
annual rate, compared with $2.9 billion last August. Low and/or falling prices,
particularly of agricultural commodities, have depressed the value of exports in
1999, but export volumes have remained virtually unchanged. The
unemployment rate for August was 14.5 percent (n.s.a.), unchanged from the
May reading, and the consumer price index held steady in September, following
two months of decline.

The Argentine presidential elections were held late last month and Fernando
de la Rua, the candidate from the Alianza party, emerged as the victor by a
decisive margin over the Peronist candidate. De la Rua appears to be solidly
behind the Convertibility Program and generally supportive of the economic
reforms introduced by President Menem. His victory was widely anticipated and
market reaction has been subdued but favorable. The Argentine stock market
jumped 8 percent the week preceding the election and has since remained around
that level. Brady spreads, which by early-October had fallen almost 400 basis
points since peaking in mid-July, dropped almost 100 basis points in the two
weeks preceding the election. In contrast, domestic interest rates for both peso
and dollar-denominated deposits have been rising over the past several months
and spreads have widened recently. This behavior perhaps reflects attempts by
depositories to retain deposits in the unsettled period surrounding the change in
government.
In Venezuela, new information points to continued poor economic performance
amid political uncertainty. Over the first half of the year, real GDP fell about
9-1/2 percent, and the sustained decline in inflation since then suggests that
economic activity has remained extremely depressed. Any positive effect of the
continued rise in oil prices appears to be more than offset by weak domestic
demand and an overvalued exchange rate.

Despite the serious recession, the government's attention remains focused on
political rather than economic matters. A constitutional assembly, elected in
July, has spent the past several months rewriting the constitution, acting to
disband the supreme court, and taking on many of the responsibilities of the
legislature. Most of the proposed constitutional changes are not dramatic, but
uncertainty surrounding the political situation has raised anxiety among both
domestic and foreign investors.
In Korea, growth continues at a healthy clip although some recent data point to a
moderation from the very rapid recovery earlier this year. In particular,
industrial production declined slightly for the second consecutive month in
September. Other indicators of activity remain strong, however. The average
factory operating rate increased to 79 percent in September, near its pre-crisis
level. Through September, the trade balance was in surplus by almost
$30 billion, down only about one-quarter from last year's surplus, as strong
exports of semiconductors and computer-related products continued partially to
offset rapidly rising imports. The unemployment rate declined further to
5.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, over 3 percentage points below its
peak of last year. The pace of inflation has picked up slightly, albeit from very
low levels.

Government forecasts now project that real GDP will register a year-over-year
increase of nearly 9 percent in 1999. With growth this rapid, recent statements
by government officials have increasingly emphasized the need to contain

IV-29
inflation, which the central bank forecasts to rise to 4 percent next year. So far,
however, the central bank has not pushed up short-term interest rates, probably
reflecting concern over the still fragile health of domestic financial institutions,
especially the investment trust companies that hold most of the ailing Daewoo's
debt securities. Daewoo's total debts are currently thought to be at least
$50 billion, about twice its estimated assets, and substantially higher than earlier
estimates. Negotiations among Daewoo, its domestic and foreign creditors, and
the government are continuing, with some agreement expected to be reached by
year-end.
In the ASEAN region as a whole, recent indicators point to a bit more moderate
growth in the third quarter. Thai industrial production remained strong in the
third quarter, Malaysian industrial production moderated only somewhat, and the
Philippine index surged in August. The exception was Singapore, which posted
weak third-quarter production growth following torrid growth in the previous
quarter. Despite strong growth in recent quarters, the region's economies remain
below capacity and inflationary pressures have been slight.

Both ASEAN exports and imports increased noticeably in the third quarter,
reflecting stronger export markets and a firming of domestic demand. The
resulting trade surpluses for the region have not shown a clear tendency in either
direction.

The political situation in Indonesia has improved following the recent
presidential election of moderate Islamic leader Abdurrahman Wahid. In order
to avoid political unrest after the election, President-elect Wahid orchestrated the
election of his principal rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as vice president and has
made ministerial appointments from the broad coalition of parties that supported
his election. As a result, the new government is unusually inclusive and, for the
time being at least, enjoys a broad base of political support. The new
government has also made public an international audit of the politically charged

Bank Bali financial scandal, possibly opening the door to resumption of an IMF
loan program. (In the wake of the scandal, which involved illicit payments to
high-ranking officials of former President B.J. Habibie's ruling Golkar party, the
IMF and other international agencies had interrupted their lending to Indonesia.)
After a second-quarter rebound, growth in Hong Kong appears to have slowed.
Retail sales were sluggish in July and August, and new mortgage lending fell
sharply in the third quarter. The trade deficit widened in the third quarter, as
growing imports outpaced a rise in exports. The unemployment rate was
6.1 percent (s.a.) in the July-September period, unchanged from June-August
period, and consumer prices fell sharply on a 12-month basis in September.
Spreads between one-year Hong Kong government debt and U.S. Treasuries fell
to 25 basis points in early November from about 75 basis points a month earlier,
as fears of a devaluation of the Chinese currency eased.

In China, there are signs that the economy may have turned the corner, with real
GDP up sharply in the third quarter on the back of surging exports. Press reports
suggest that Chinese policymakers recently have become more confident that
this year's GDP growth target of 7 percent will be reached. Soaring exports in
the third quarter caused the trade surplus, which had narrowed sharply in the first
half of the year, to more than double. Prices continue to fall on a year-over-year
basis, reflecting still weak private domestic demand, but the recent drop off in
rates of decline is a hint that deflationary pressures are easing. Talks on China's
accession to the WTO resumed in September, though there still remain many
hurdles to a final deal.

In Taiwan, industrial production and the volume of trade in September fell
noticeably from the previous month, reflecting the impact of a major earthquake
late in the month that temporarily halted production with widespread electricity
outages. Electricity has largely been restored, damage to infrastructure was
found to be minimal, and the volume of trade rebounded sharply in October,
suggesting that the longer-term effects of the earthquake will be limited. The
unemployment rate was 2.9 percent in September (s.a.), little changed from
previous months. The inflation rate remained low in September and October,
despite the impact of the earthquake.
In Russia the underlying trend in industrial production has flattened now that the
boost from import substitution after the 1998 collapse of the ruble has run its
course, but surging oil prices have continued to keep tax revenues and the
current account surplus above their pre-crisis levels. Investigations into the
recent money laundering scandal and the alleged misuse of IMF funds are still
pending but, by the end of December, Russia expects to receive the second
$640 million tranche from the IMF loan approved in August.
