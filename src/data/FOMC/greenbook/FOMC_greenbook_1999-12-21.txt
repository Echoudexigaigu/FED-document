created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economic expansion appears to have lost little, if any, of its considerable
vigor. Payrolls continue to rise rapidly, and manufacturers registered a
substantial gain in production last month. Consumer demand has remained
robust, with spirits elevated in part by further gains in stock market wealth.
Although business fixed investment is unlikely to match the third quarter's sharp
advance, the underlying uptrend in capital spending is still well intact. At the
same time, consumer price increases were modest in the past couple of months,
with a temporary respite from the outsized energy price hikes of the spring and
summer.
Labor Market Developments
The demand for workers remained strong in November. Payroll gains were well
maintained, despite continuing anecdotal reports of labor shortages, and the
unemployment rate held at the lowest level in almost thirty years.
Private nonfarm payrolls expanded 203,000 in November, having gained
239,000 and 95,000 in October and September, respectively. The average
increase for the three months of 180,000 was close to the 190,000 pace of the
first eight months of the year. The services industry drove much of the private
job growth in November, posting an increase of 120,000--right in line with its
average pace this year. Within services, employment at computer services and
data processing firms has tailed off noticeably in recent months, reportedly
reflecting some drop-off in Y2K-related work.
Payrolls of retail trade establishments were essentially unchanged on a
seasonally adjusted basis in November. Labor "shortages" may be constraining
hiring in this sector. Despite widespread expectations of strong holiday sales,
employment in three seasonally sensitive categories--general merchandise stores,
apparel and accessory stores, and miscellaneous retail establishments--posted
somewhat smaller gains in October and November than the normal seasonal
increase. The Beige Book reported that firms in a number of Districts were
having difficulty hiring temporary holiday workers.
In the goods-producing sector, construction employment rose 55,000 in
November, after October's gain of 20,000. Typically, construction firms begin
laying off workers in November as weather conditions deteriorate. This year,
however, shortages of workers in the skilled trades during the busy summer
months left firms with a backlog of projects, and last month's warmer-than-usual
weather may have allowed some building to continue that would otherwise have
been curtailed. In manufacturing, the pace of job loss has slowed considerably
in recent months, averaging 9,000 per month since September compared with an
average monthly decline of 29,000 over the first eight months of the year.

Aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm
payrolls rose 0.3 percent in November, reflecting the gains in employment and
an implied increase in the workweek to 34.6 hours. We are anticipating that the
aggregate hours index will rise more than 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate this
quarter, but total hours in the nonfarm business sector may increase less,
reflecting a slip in "non-employee" hours so far this quarter.
The unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent last month, and the labor force
participation rate held at 67.0 percent. The participation rate has generally been
drifting sideways since the fall of 1996--mostly fluctuating between 66.8 percent
and 67.2 percent during this period. The share of the population aged 16 to 64
who report that they want a job but who are not in the labor force moved up in
November but remained below the third-quarter average. Over the past several
years, this series has been moving down with the unemployment rate, and last
month's uptick did not really disturb the trend.
Other indicators confirm the strength of labor demand. The four-week moving
average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has held below 300,000
since late July. According to the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, firms are still reporting hiring difficulties, while the most recent
readings from the Manpower, Inc., and NFIB surveys of hiring plans remained
quite positive. The forward-looking reading on expected labor market
conditions from the Michigan Survey Research Center improved considerably in
the preliminary December data, underscoring households' expectations of
continued strength in employment.
According to the most recent release from the BLS, productivity in the nonfarm
business sector is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in
the third quarter. Over the past year, productivity advanced 3.1 percent,
compared with a 2.4 percent gain in the previous four quarters. The acceleration
in productivity in recent years--during a period when output stopped
accelerating--underpins our view that the recent pickup in productivity growth
reflects in large measure an acceleration in structural productivity.
Industrial Production
Industrial production increased 0.3 percent in November, with manufacturing
output rising substantially for a second month while the output of utilities fell
because of unseasonably warm weather. The moderate rise follows a sharp
0.8 percent increase in production in October, which partly reflected a
bounceback from the effects of Hurricane Floyd. The factory operating rate rose
to 80 percent in October and edged up a tad further in November; still,
manufacturing capacity utilization is 1-1/2 percentage points below its long-term
average.

Motor vehicle assemblies reached 13.4 million units in November (annual rate),
well above the average for this year. Assembly plans for the first quarter
indicate that manufacturers intend to maintain a high level of production,
undoubtedly encouraged by the record pace of sales so far this year. However,
GM has indicated that it will trim production plans in the first quarter by about
200,000 units (annual rate) to correct excessive inventories of some models.
Elsewhere in the transportation sector, the production of aircraft and parts
dropped again in November. In addition to ongoing plans to downshift
production, Boeing has recently experienced production interruptions, including
delays in the shipment of 34 planes that had been equipped with faulty drip
shields, a series of additional quality-control problems, and the unscheduled
implementation of a three-month FAA inspection.

Computer production rose strongly in November, albeit not as rapidly as in
recent months. Detailed data for the third quarter show that the production of
personal computers and small-scale servers soared, but that the output of
mainframes plummeted at an annual rate of about 40 percent. That sharp drop is
consistent with reports that mainframe users have "locked down" systems prior
to the turn of the year. The production of communications equipment, while
still expanding, appears to have settled at a somewhat slower rate of increase
than that recorded over the first half of the year, whereas the rise in
semiconductor production in November about matched October's robust gains.
The output of construction supplies posted a third sizable monthly increase in
November. The production of consumer durables edged off a bit, but output of
consumer nondurables showed a slight gain; the large increases that occurred in

The pickup in the pace of industrial production in 1999 has begun to lift the rate
of capacity utilization. Looking forward, the evidence regarding future capital
spending and capacity expansion by manufacturers is mixed. Some recent
indicators, such as the sharp decline in contracts for industrial buildings, flat
vacancy rates, and the low utilization rates themselves, would seem to indicate
that there is, on average, no marked incentive to accelerate capital spending and
boost the rate of growth of manufacturing capacity. In some sectors, though,
strains on productive facilities have begun to emerge--for example, in the
production of light trucks and some construction materials. The National
Association of Purchasing Management's (NAPM) semiannual survey
conducted in November reports that more manufacturers plan to increase than to
decrease their capital expenditures in 2000. This diffusion index, which has
been a good predictor of actual capital spending, suggests a moderate increase in

manufacturing investment in 2000, after what we estimate to have been a small
decline in 1999.1
Real adjusted durable goods orders declined sharply in October. A good portion
of this decline reflects a 25 percent drop in orders for engines and turbines.
However, orders in this category are subject to erratic movements, and the lead
times are so long that sharp monthly movements contain little information for
near-term production prospects.
Consumer Spending
The spending data in hand, as well as reports on consumer sentiment,
employment, and the further sharp upward movement in the stock market, all
point to a continuation of brisk growth in consumer outlays in the fourth quarter.
Light vehicle sales rebounded to 17.2 million units in November (excluding the
estimated effects of shifts in reporting periods), and confidential information
from manufacturers suggests that a good part of the jump stemmed from an
improvement in sales to consumers. According to informal discussions with
industry contacts, sales of new vehicles stayed near November's very high level
through the first ten days of December. Automakers also indicated that
incentives are likely to remain near the fourth quarter's high level early next
year.
Total nominal retail sales jumped 0.9 percent in November. Nominal sales in
the retail control category rose 0.3 percent in November, and the percent change
for October was revised up to 0.8 percent. As a result, the average level of retail
control spending in October and November was 1.8 percent above the third-
quarter average, not at an annual rate. Strength was evident across most
categories of stores.
Data on service expenditures in November are not yet available, but two
indicators that BEA uses to construct its estimate are providing mixed signals at
this point. The volume of trading on the major stock exchanges soared further
in November, which points to a large increase in PCE brokerage charges and
investment counseling (about 1-3/4 percent of total PCE services). In contrast,
temperatures in November were much warmer than usual, suggesting a decrease
in spending on energy services (about 3-1/2 percent of total PCE services) last
month.
1. Although the diffusion index of predicted capital expenditures has proved to be a good
indicator of actual expenditures, the NAPM readings on actual spending have not proved to be
good indicators of the comprehensive Census Bureau data that are used in our capacity
estimates.

Near-term indicators of demand, as well as anecdotal reports on retail sales,
suggest that spending in December is likely to remain strong. According to the
Conference Board, consumer sentiment rebounded in November to a level near
the highs recorded earlier this year. The preliminary report from the Michigan
Survey Research Center revealed a drop in sentiment in early December, but
also showed that consumers' expectations regarding unemployment over the
next year--which have proved useful in tracking consumption expenditures--
improved sharply.
Nominal personal income jumped 1.3 percent in October. Much of the steep
rise was attributable to special factors--agricultural subsidy payments, union
contract-signing bonuses, and a considerable bounceback in rental income after
the effects of Hurricane Floyd in September. Still, netting out these special
factors, BEA estimated that nominal personal income increased a solid
0.5 percent in October. The latest employment report suggests personal income
in November will be boosted by another sizable increase in wages and salaries.
Housing Markets
Some indicators of housing activity strengthened in October, but the increases
may be temporary. Although single-family starts rose 2-3/4 percent, to
1.33 million units (annual rate), adjusted permits for single-family dwellings
declined 2 percent, to a level of permits more suggestive of starts near the
1.25 million mark. Apart from the possibility that starts actually may not have
been as strong as estimated, activity may have received a boost from the
commencement of projects that had been delayed by shortages of labor and
some materials. Also, starts in the Northeast likely were elevated some by
activity that had been delayed in September by Hurricane Floyd.
Sales of new homes surged 16-1/4 percent in October, to an annual rate of
986,000 units--a new high for the series. However, half of the rise reflected a
suspicious 40 percent jump in sales in the Midwest. Given the unusual size of
this increase and the recent pattern of fairly large revisions to the new home
sales series, some trimming of the initial estimate would not be surprising.2
Discounting the October estimate somewhat and averaging it with the lower
September reading would put the average pace of sales over the past two months
a bit below the pace recorded in the spring and early summer. Existing home
2. The Census Bureau estimates of new home sales are based on a sample of building
permits issued by local governments plus an imputation for sales that occur before the issuance
of a permit. Census has experienced long-standing problems with this imputation, and Census
staff report that such difficulties accounted for most of the large revisions to the new home sales
estimates in recent months.

sales decreased 6-1/2 percent in October--the fourth consecutive monthly
decline.
More timely indicators of housing demand ticked up in November but were
mixed in December. Builders' ratings of new home sales--which are collected
during the first half of the month--rose a bit in November but retraced that
movement in December. The Mortgage Bankers Association's index of
purchase loan applications also continued to rise, on balance, through early
December. However, the Michigan SRC measure of consumer opinions of
homebuying conditions fell in early December, reversing November's increase;
the latest decline reflected a drop in the share of respondents indicating that
mortgage rates were relatively low.
In the multifamily sector, starts dropped 10 percent in October, to an annual rate
of 303,000 units, only a touch above the low for the year. However, multifamily
permit issuance jumped 25 percent, more than offsetting its drop in September
and suggesting that starts should rise later this fall. The vacancy rate for
multifamily rental units has been trending down, and in the third quarter was at
one of the lowest levels since the mid-1980s.
Movements in the prices of construction materials have been mixed. Despite
upticks in November and December, the year-over-year rates of change in
lumber and plywood prices have slowed substantially from earlier this year, and
the rise in the price of insulation materials also has been tapering off. In
contrast, the price of gypsum products has continued to accelerate. Labor cost
increases have moderated recently after picking up over the first half of this
year.
Business Investment
Equipment and software. The underlying trend in equipment and software
spending remains robust, although some reversal of the third-quarter surge in
outlays on motor vehicles appears to be under way.4 The data through October
indicate that outlays for equipment other than motor vehicles started the fourth
quarter on a positive note, primarily because of a 16-3/4 percent jump in
shipments of office and computing equipment in October. However, the surge
3. More than half of existing home sales are recorded when the sale is closed; therefore,
movements in sales of existing homes typically lag those in new home sales, all of which are
recorded early in the sale process (at the time a contract is signed or when a deposit is made).
4. The reversal is concentrated in light vehicle purchases: Confidential data from industry
sources suggest that fleet sales of light vehicles in October and November were below the
elevated pace of the third quarter. Sales of medium and heavy trucks in October and November
were, on average, up 30,000 units from the third quarter's high level.

in shipments followed a 15-3/4 percent plunge in the preceding two months,
leaving the October level of shipments about 7-1/2 percent above the third-
quarter average. Other available indicators point to less robust growth in the
current quarter in real spending on computers: Computer prices appear to be
declining less rapidly than in the first half of the year, and computer imports
finished the third quarter on a decidedly negative note. Overall, the signs of
slowing in computer expenditures this quarter are less apparent than earlier
expectations regarding Y2K "lockdowns" suggested.
Growth of software investment--which, by construction, is positively correlated
with growth of computer expenditures--also seems likely to be considerable in
the current quarter but may slow somewhat with computer spending. Firms that
are unwilling to deploy new hardware may also refrain from installing new
software applications.
Outlays on communications equipment appear to be rising slowly this quarter
following a sub-par performance in the third quarter. Shipments of
communications equipment dropped notably in October, leaving the level of
shipments 3-3/4 percent below the third-quarter average. However, the recent
slow pace of growth in this category is likely only a temporary setback. Major
communications equipment producers have continued to report booming
demand for their products. Furthermore, orders have far outpaced shipments in
recent months, leaving a sizable backlog yet to be filled.
Business expenditures on aircraft likely will boost equipment spending again in
the fourth quarter. Aircraft shipments rose smartly in October and now stand
9-1/2 percent above their third-quarter average. Although Boeing plans to
deliver fewer aircraft in the current quarter than it did in the third quarter (on a
seasonally adjusted basis), a larger share is expected to be delivered to domestic
airlines. Moreover, U.S. carriers are continuing to buy large numbers of planes
from abroad: Deliveries to domestic carriers from Airbus have picked up
considerably since the first half of the year.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, orders for nondefense
capital goods fell 3-1/2 percent in October. The decline resulted mainly from
the 25 percent drop in orders of engines and turbines; as mentioned above, the
erratic month-to-month movements in this category contain little information for
the near term. Looking through the monthly noise, the level of orders for
5. A recent report from Intel supports the anecdotes that the degree of Y2K-related slowing
in computer expenditures this quarter may be less than previously anticipated. The company
initially forecast a significant Y2K effect on computer sales this quarter and consequently has
been surprised by the demand for its Coppermine microprocessors.

equipment excluding high-tech and transportation in October was still a bit
above the level of shipments (which declined 1-1/2 percent in October), causing
the backlog of unfilled orders to increase for the third consecutive month. In
addition, imports rose briskly in the third quarter and may buoy outlays again in
the current quarter. Thus, real domestic equipment spending in this category
appears on track to grow moderately in the fourth quarter.
Nonresidential structures. Spending on nonresidential construction slowed in
October, with nominal outlays for private buildings declining 1-1/2 percent after
a 1-1/4 percent decrease in the third quarter. Except for a small uptick in July,
private nonresidential construction put in place has declined in every month
since March, and in October was down 4 percent from a year earlier. Contracts
for nonresidential construction declined 4-1/2 percent in October after a
9-1/2 percent drop in the third quarter.6
Spending for construction of office buildings fell 3-1/2 percent in October,
offsetting most of a large increase in September and leaving the level of
spending close to its third-quarter average. Despite the October decline, office
construction was 13 percent above the level of a year earlier. Contracts for
office construction declined in October for the third consecutive month; the
12 percent decrease brought office building contracts down to the lowest level
since early 1997. Still, there are no noticeable signs of overbuilding in the
aggregate. Although the rates of increase in both rent and property values
continued to taper off, they remain fairly high. Furthermore, after rising some
earlier this year, the vacancy rate for office properties in downtown locations
edged down in the third quarter, and the rate for suburban locations was
unchanged; both series remain at very low levels.
Construction spending for commercial structures (which include retail space and
warehouses) was unchanged in October after four months of decline and is
down 2-1/4 percent below the level of a year earlier. Contracts for commercial
structures rose 9-3/4 percent in October--the first increase in this category since
June. Rents and property values for retail space still are increasing, albeit
relatively slowly. Property values for warehouses continued to rise at a fast
clip, and warehouse rents maintained their moderate rate of increase.
Outlays for industrial buildings continued to plummet; the 5-3/4 percent drop in
October left expenditures nearly 28 percent below the year-earlier level. Also,
despite a 25 percent rebound in October, contract awards for industrial
construction still were 25 percent below their level of a year ago. As of the third

quarter, the vacancy rate for industrial properties, although edging down,
remained elevated.
Business Inventories
The pace of inventory accumulation rose considerably in September and
October. For manufacturing and trade excluding motor vehicles, the book value
of inventories increased at a $43 billion annual rate in October, a touch below
the September pace but about the same as the rate posted in the third quarter as a
whole. While the sectoral pattern of the build-up contains some hints of
precautionary stockbuilding associated with Y2K concerns, sales have also been
strong, and inventory-sales ratios have not picked up.
In manufacturing, the book value of inventories increased at a $17 billion annual
rate in October, up a bit from the $12 billion pace posted in the third quarter.
Aircraft inventories declined at an annual rate of $9 billion in October as Boeing
continued to curtail production. Outside of the aircraft industry, stocks rose at a
$25 billion annual rate, led by large increases in inventories held by
manufacturers of food products and electrical machinery. The $6 billion rise in
stocks at food manufacturers--the largest one-month gain in more than four
years--may reflect stockpiling associated with the century date change.
Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of
$10 billion in October. The accumulation was damped by a $14 billion
liquidation of inventories held by farm product distributors. The decline in farm
product inventories followed an $8 billion increase in the third quarter, which
may have resulted, in part, from an early start to this year's harvest. In October,
the peak month of the fall harvest, farm stocks rose at an annual rate of
$54 billion on a not seasonally adjusted basis, but that was a smaller increase
than the seasonal factors anticipated. Moreover, grain prices fell 4 percent in
October, and this likely lowered inventories in book-value terms. Excluding
farm products (and motor vehicles), wholesale inventories accumulated at an
annual rate of $24 billion, up from a $17 billion increase in the third quarter.
The build-up was led by an $8 billion accumulation at distributors of electrical
goods and a $6 billion accumulation at drug wholesalers, which may be holding
extra inventories to avoid Y2K-related stockouts.
The book value of retail inventories rose $1.3 billion at an annual rate in
October, held down by a sizable liquidation at automotive dealerships.
Excluding automotive dealers, retailers accrued inventories at a $17 billion
annual rate in October, a step-up from the pace recorded in the third quarter.

Government Expenditures
Federal government sector. The federal government's fiscal position
continues to show improvement. For the twelve months ended in October, the
surplus adjusted for routine payment-timing shifts, deposit insurance, spectrum
auction proceeds, and sales of major assets reached $112 billion. This is
$55 billion greater than in the preceding twelve months.
Adjusted outlays continued to grow at a subdued pace in October, although a
large increase in farm support payments boosted the "other" category. Net
interest payments fell further, while spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and other
health spending was restrained.
Receipts were only about 1 percent above the level recorded last October.
However, this understates the strength of receipts because the 1997 Taxpayer
Relief Act boosted last October's excise tax payments (included in "other"),
shifting them out of September and August 1998. Individual income and
payroll taxes continued to increase moderately in October, up 6 percent from a
year earlier.
The legislation needed to implement the fiscal 2000 budget was completed with
the enactment of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act in late
November. This legislation included the five regular appropriations bills for
fiscal 2000 that had not yet been completed. The CBO has estimated that this
action brings total fiscal 2000 discretionary spending to $617 billion, $37 billion
above its July baseline (which had assumed adherence to the spending caps).
The increased spending included in the bill is not expected to violate
discretionary spending caps and trigger a sequester primarily because a
substantial portion ($20 billion) of the increase was designated as emergency
spending that is exempt from the caps. Additionally, provisions to offset some
of the spending increases include a small (0.38 percent) across-the-board cut in
most discretionary spending accounts, a delay into fiscal 2001 of the end-of-
September paydays for some military and civilian personnel, and an acceleration
in the payment to the Treasury of $4 billion in Federal Reserve earnings.7
Finally, OMB, whose estimates determine whether a sequester is needed, is
expected to have lower spending estimates than CBO for this year's
appropriation bills.
7. The President is given substantial discretion in determining the allocation of the across-
the-board cuts within departments and agencies. The accelerated payment of Federal Reserve
earnings will come out of the System's surplus account.

State and local government sector. Indicators of spending by state and local
governments in the fourth quarter point to another solid increase. Employment
gains averaged 30,000 during October and November, about matching the
average so far this year and a little higher than the average in 1998. In addition,
real construction expenditures rose 0.6 percent in October, bringing the level of
real outlays 1.4 percent above its third-quarter average.
The tobacco settlement between 46 states and a group of tobacco companies was
finally approved on November 12, nearly one year after it was announced. On
December 14, payments of around $2 billion were released to the states.
Another $2.5 billion is to be distributed from the tobacco companies on January
10, and $4.5 billion will be distributed on April 15;8 most of it will go directly to
the states, but some will go into the escrow account as long as some states have
not approved the settlement.9 Tobacco payments will continue in perpetuity and
are expected to total around $206 billion over the first 25 years. So far, 21
states have decided how to use the tobacco money; programs expected to benefit
include health care, education, tobacco control and smoking cessation, non-
health-related children's services, and services to the elderly. In addition, some
funds are being set aside for other general fund needs and for budget reserve
accounts.
Prices and Labor Costs
Inflation has remained subdued in recent months. The consumer price index
rose just 0.1 percent in November, following an increase of 0.2 percent in
October. Outside of food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in each
of the past two months.10 Over the past twelve months, the overall CPI was up
2.6 percent, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in the year-earlier period,
with the acceleration accounted for by a large increase in energy prices.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up 2.1 percent over the past twelve
8. Funds totaling $2.4 billion from the tobacco companies had been placed in an escrow
account during the fourth quarter of 1998 pending the final approval of the agreement; at that
time BEA scored this transaction as state and local indirect business tax and nontax accruals.
Thus, the current distribution will not have a direct effect on the NIPAs. BEA plans to spread
the 2000 payments evenly throughout the year in the NIPAs.
9. Seven states have not yet approved the master settlement and have not yet received funds.
They include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.
As these states reach approval status, more money will be released. Reaching final approval
status--dubbed "state specific finality"--means that all legal challenges to the agreement between
that state and the tobacco companies have been cleared. If a state fails to approve the agreement
by December 31, 2001, the state's participation in the settlement is terminated.
10. Although the October and November increases in core CPI were modest, the 0.3 percent
jump in September sets up a sizable fourth-quarter increase in core CPI on a quarterly average
basis. Excluding tobacco (as well as food and energy), the monthly figures through November
also point to a step-up in the quarterly average pace.

months, down a little from its pace in the prior twelve-month period on a
published basis."
Energy prices were little changed in October and November. Higher crude oil
prices pushed up heating oil prices in both months, but low margins through
mid-November held retail gasoline prices in check. Looking ahead, the recent
increases in crude costs likely will lead to sizable additional hikes in gasoline
and heating oil prices in coming months; for gasoline, higher prices already are
evident in surveys for early December. As for Y2K considerations, the
increases in crude oil prices seem to stem mostly from other factors, and there
are not many signs that prices of refined product have been affected to date by
precautionary stockpiling. Food prices rose modestly in both October and
November. Over the past twelve months, the food index increased 1.9 percent,
a little less than the increase in the CPI excluding food and energy.
In October and November, the modest increases in the core CPI reflected
softness in prices of core commodities that was balanced by a pickup in price
increases for non-energy services. In November, price declines for core
commodities were widespread, including drops in the prices of tobacco and
apparel, relatively erratic categories. Apparel prices dropped back last month
after two months of sizable increases, and cigarette prices were pulled down by
discounts on selected major brands. Tobacco product prices have been
particularly volatile in the past year, and the large increases in retail prices
associated with last year's settlement between the tobacco companies and the
states--especially the jump last December--have boosted the increase in core
commodity prices and the overall core CPI over the past year.12 Over the past
twelve months, the CPI for core commodities was up 3/4 percent, but that
increase owed to the very large increase in tobacco prices over the past year."
Prices of core services rose 0.4 percent in November and 0.3 percent in October,
larger increases than seen in the prior couple of months. In October, the
services figure was pushed up by a jump in the airfares category, but last month
the increase owed to a faster pace for owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent,
both of which rose 0.4 percent in November. According to BLS, the upward
movement in both series reflected widespread increases in their source quotes.
11. On a current-methods basis, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent over the past twelve
months, the same as its pace in the year-earlier period.
12. The core CPI excluding tobacco (as well as food and energy) was up 1.7 percent over
the past twelve months, compared with the 2.1 percent increase in core CPI when tobacco is
included.
13. Next month, last December's jump in tobacco prices will fall out of the twelve-month
change, and we expect the twelve-month change in prices of core commodities to drop back in
the next CPI release.

The PPI for capital equipment edged down 0.1 percent in November after an
increase of 0.3 percent in October. Over the past twelve months, the prices of
capital goods have been essentially unchanged, with modest price increases for
many types of equipment balanced by declines in prices of computers and
communication equipment. In November, computer prices fell 1.0 percent; their
average rate of decline over the past three months has been relatively slow
compared with the trend of recent years. This slowing in price declines for
computers likely reflects some supply disruptions for components; lately, these
disruptions appear to have abated.
The NIPA-based inflation measures also have remained quite tame, aside from
energy. For consumers, the PCE chain price index for items other than food and
energy rose 1-1/4 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of
this year, the same as the pace in the prior four-quarter period. Reflecting the
run-up in energy prices, the overall PCE price index was up 1-3/4 percent from
a year earlier, compared with an increase of just 1 percent in the prior four-
quarter period. The price index for gross domestic purchases-which includes
consumption, investment, and government prices-showed a similar pickup. On
the other hand, the price index for gross domestic product-which measures
prices of goods produced in the United States and therefore places a smaller
weight on energy-increased 1-1/4 percent over the past four quarters, about the
same as the increase in the year-earlier period.
Near-term inflation expectations have moved up recently, probably reflecting, at
least in part, the increases in energy prices seen over much of this year.
Specifically, the median of one-year ahead inflation expectations from the
Michigan Survey has averaged 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, up about
1/2 percentage point from the end of last year. However, longer-term inflation
expectations as measured in both the Michigan Survey and the Professional
Forecasters Survey have not moved up since the end of last year and remain at
about 3 percent and 2-1/2 percent, respectively.
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for intermediate materials excluding
food and energy rose 0.1 percent in November, the ninth consecutive month of
increase. Over the past twelve months, this index is up 1.5 percent, reversing
the decline registered in the preceding twelve months. The index for core crude
prices, after considerably larger increases in the previous several months, rose
0.3 percent in November. Although prices of some industrial commodities--
such as petroleum products and steel scrap--have moved up since mid-
November, there are hints of a pause in the upward trend in commodity prices in
the past couple of months. In particular, broad indexes of industrial commodity
prices have fluctuated in a fairly narrow range since the end of September after

having rebounded from the substantial declines associated with the Asian
economic crisis.
For the third quarter, compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector--as
reported by the BLS in the Productivity and Cost release--increased at an annual
rate of 4.7 percent. Over the past four quarters, compensation per hour has risen
4.6 percent, down from the 5.7 percent increase reported for the previous four
quarters. This deceleration is even greater than that in the ECI, although the
current pace of increase in compensation per hour is well above the 3.1 percent
pace registered by the ECI over the past year.
Our only data on labor costs for the fourth quarter are the monthly figures for
average hourly earnings.14 In November, hourly wages rose 0.1 percent after an
upward-revised increase of 0.3 percent in October. Over the past twelve
months, average hourly earnings are up 3.6 percent, similar to the pace seen
since early this year. Although these modest advances in average hourly
earnings appear to contradict the widespread anecdotes about labor market
tightness, this measure of wages does not include many types of compensation--
such as hiring and retention bonuses, employee discounts, and payments in
kind--that employers have reportedly offered to attract and retain workers.
14. In addition to hard data, anecdotal reports suggest hefty bonus payments on Wall Street
this year. The ECI will incorporate these at the time that they are paid, and any bonuses paid
after the middle of December will appear in the first-quarter ECI figures. (The fourth-quarter
ECI will pick up bonuses paid through the payroll week including December 12th.)

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
The announcement of a policy tightening and the shift to a neutral bias after the
last FOMC meeting elicited only a slight rise in Treasury yields. However,
yields trended higher in subsequent weeks as the policy statement and comments
by Federal Reserve officials were taken as suggesting that inflation pressures
remained a significant concern. In addition, economic data released over the
intermeeting period have generally pointed to unsustainable growth, although the
readings on wages and prices remained favorable. This combination led market
participants to mark up their expectations for short-term rates next year: Futures
quotes now indicate expectations that the funds rate will be raised to 6 percent or
above by the end of next year, more than 1/4 percentage point higher than
anticipated at the time of the November FOMC meeting.
On net, Treasury coupon yields have risen about 25 basis points. Corporate
bond yields are up by less or have even moved a little lower; the narrowing of
spreads may reflect reduced concerns about market liquidity around year-end, as
well as generally favorable economic data. The latter, along with increasingly
optimistic views of the prospects for technology companies, also helped to buoy
equity markets over the intermeeting period. Broad measures of share prices
climbed 1 percent to 4 percent on balance, reaching new highs. The technology-
rich Nasdaq rose nearly 11 percent.
Available data on borrowing by nonfederal sectors in the fourth quarter point to
continued brisk expansion, although debt growth is likely to fall short of the
9-1/4 percent pace in the third quarter. Businesses borrowed large amounts at
commercial banks as well as in the bond markets in November. Households also
appear to be taking on debt at a brisk pace, especially mortgage debt.
Meanwhile, the paydown of federal debt has slowed as the Treasury seeks to
build up its cash balance to an unusual degree in preparation for potential Y2K
needs.
Year-End Financing Pressures
Measures of year-end pressures continue to indicate expectations of elevated
funding costs and reluctance to be exposed to refinancing risks around the turn
of the year. Nonetheless, concerns that conditions will deteriorate markedly
toward year-end have mostly disappeared. Indeed, most measures of year-end
funding pressures, including the Eurodollar deposit butterfly spread and forward
premiums derived from yields on commercial paper, term fed funds, and term
repos, have changed little on balance in recent weeks, preserving the
considerable easing in these measures that occurred in late October and the first
half of November.

Although the premiums remain substantially larger than over previous year-ends,
liquidity and issuance in capital markets have been much better maintained in
recent weeks than many had anticipated.
Various initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve, including the sale of options on
repurchase agreements around year-end, have contributed to the more relaxed
attitudes toward year-end funding. The final weekly auction of the options was
completed on December 1, and premiums paid and volumes of bids remained
significantly below their early-November peaks for all three of the weekly strips.
A total of $481 billion of options was sold in seven auctions, far exceeding the
amount initially scheduled. Apparently, dealers consider these options to be
relatively inexpensive insurance against the possibility of a disruption in access
to financing around year-end. Borrowing from the Special Liquidity Facility has
remained subdued over recent weeks.
In commercial paper markets, firms have continued to focus on placing their
paper well into the new year to avoid the last week of December and the early
part of January. About 70 percent of all outstanding paper will mature beyond
the first two weeks in January, about 15 percentage points more than at the same
point in recent years. Premiums for funding across year-end are above those
prevailing last year, although they have drifted down on balance over recent
weeks.
Many market participants had expected some deterioration in liquidity in the
Treasury market as year-end approaches, in part because dealers often pare back
their activity in the market at the close of their fiscal years. The positions of the
four primary dealers whose fiscal years ended November 30 were reduced only
slightly, however, as their fiscal year drew to an end. For the other dealers,
changes to date in trading volumes and balance sheets have been in line with
previous year-ends.
Banks continued to stockpile vault cash over the intermeeting period, and
holdings are currently more than 50 percent, or roughly $25 billion, above their
early August levels. This far exceeds the normal seasonal increase of around $2
billion to $3 billion. Currency held by the public has started to pick up in recent
weeks, but holdings are still only somewhat elevated relative to previous year-
ends.
Banks' managed liabilities surged tremendously last month, particularly large
time deposits, likely related in part to the century date change. From the supply-
side perspective, the run-up in banks' managed liabilities seems to be driven by
the steps banks themselves are taking to get ready for the century date change,
such as helping to finance the extraordinary increase in vault cash and a rapid

growth in loans. Part of this loan growth reportedly owes to a buildup in
inventories and liquid assets as firms take precautions before year-end. In
addition, branches and agencies of foreign banks evidently used some of the
large time issuance to help fund their head offices abroad. From the demand-
side perspective, some of the bulge in managed liabilities may reflect a buildup
in liquidity by firms as protection against the possibility of disruptions in cash
flows or the inability to roll over maturing obligations around year-end.
Balances in institution-only money market mutual funds, another potential
parking spot for funds, also have ramped up recently. Overall, it seems clear
that any demand-driven sources have not been sufficient to meet banks' needs
for funds, as domestic banks have also tapped foreign offices and sold securities
to fund loan growth.
Business Finance
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations exploded in November, to a
record $20 billion. Several massive initial offerings, led by the United Parcel
Service deal that raised $5-1/2 billion, boosted total IPO issuance to a record
$12-1/2 billion. Investor enthusiasm for Internet-related IPOs continued
unabated, and first-day returns of 100 percent and more were the norm.
Offerings of seasoned equity also ballooned in November, with
telecommunications firms accounting for nearly half of the total volume.
Looking ahead, the list of registrations for future offerings remains long, and
there are no signs of the IPO market winding down for year-end.
Gross offerings of bonds by nonfinancial corporations rebounded in November
after a lull in October that reportedly reflected investors' uncertainty about
FOMC action and year-end liquidity. Sales by both investment-grade and
speculative-grade firms increased, but investor interest was still mainly focused
on large, liquid issues. Risk premiums narrowed as yields on investment-grade
debt increased less than yields on Treasury benchmarks, and yields on below-
investment-grade debt actually edged down. Net issuance of commercial paper
was slight in November, probably owing to the rebound in bond markets, but has
moved back up in early December. And, as noted, growth of business loans at
banks turned up sharply last month, even as lending officers continued to snug
standards and terms on C&I loans. Overall, net business borrowing in
November was surprisingly strong. Available data indicate this strength has
carried through to early December.
The credit performance of U.S. businesses has eroded a bit, but still is strong
overall. The problems that have emerged in the bond market appear
concentrated among borrowers in the junk sector and reflect the fallout from the
easy provision of credit through the middle of last year. Junk bond defaults
picked up further in November, boosting the twelve-month trailing average
default rate to its highest level since 1991. In the banking sector, delinquency

rates on business loans continued their gradual rise last quarter. A broader
measure of credit problems, the ratio of the liabilities of failed firms to total
liabilities for nonfinancial businesses, has picked up a bit recently, although it
remains at a relatively low level. Moody's rating changes in November resulted
in a modest net downgrade, both in terms of the number of rating actions and the
amount of affected debt, and more firms remain on watch for possible
downgrades than upgrades.
Merger activity continued at a rapid pace. Mergers financed with cash
payments--instead of stock--led to equity retirements of about $25 billion at an
annual rate in October and November, down from the third quarter but in line
with the brisk rate in the first half of this year. New deals continued to be
announced at a blistering pace, boosting the pending list to nearly a trillion
dollars. While the bulk of the deals will be financed with stock, indications are
that cash needs will remain high in the near term. Announcements of share
repurchases have picked up this quarter from a weak third-quarter level but
remain below last year's record pace.
Preliminary NIPA estimates showed third-quarter after-tax reported earnings up
about 12 percent from a year ago, less than the rise in operating profits per share
of S&P 500 companies. The NIPA data suggest that most of the growth in
earnings came from foreign operations of larger companies, which tend to be
concentrated in the S&P 500 index, while earnings for smaller companies, which
are not included in that index, were held down by rising interest costs and
reduced margins.
Equity price indexes set new records during the intermeeting period, propelled
by technology sector gains that sent the Nasdaq composite up more than
10 percent; the ratio of price to twelve-month trailing earnings for Nasdaq stocks
stood at 134 at the end of October, and price increases since then--taken alone--
have lifted the ratio above 150. Broader indexes posted smaller increases--about
1 percent to 4 percent--as prices outside the technology sector were generally
flat or down somewhat. The recent gains in the S&P 500 index, combined with
rising interest rates, have squeezed the spread of the S&P forward earnings-price
ratio over the real thirty-year Treasury bond to its narrowest point on record.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Interest rates on commercial mortgages in primary markets were little changed
last month and remain substantially higher--roughly 120 basis points--than at the
end of last year. Yields on commercial mortgage-backed securities have risen a
similar amount over the year. Since the last FOMC meeting, yields on AAA-
rated CMBS have increased about in line with those on ten-year Treasury notes.
Despite the increase in rates, CMBS issuance shows no evidence yet of a
slowdown. Gross issuance is projected to total $13 billion in the fourth quarter,

maintaining the third-quarter pace. Market participants indicate that any
slowdown caused by year-end funding concerns will be confined to the final two
weeks of this year.
Commercial mortgage lending by financial institutions rose at a hefty
13-1/2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, paced by strong loan growth at
banks, at thrifts, and at government-sponsored enterprises. Delinquency rates on
commercial mortgage loans held by banks and life insurance companies remain
at or near record low levels.
Household Finance
With the rise in equity prices this quarter, the ratio of household assets to income
probably has set another record. Net new flows into equity mutual funds
increased at nearly a $20 billion monthly pace in October and November, a rate
exceeding that of the first three quarters of the year. Domestic funds continued
to draw the bulk of inflows, but growth of international equity funds also picked
up considerably. In contrast, declining bond prices over the intermeeting period
apparently encouraged continued outflows from bond funds. Available weekly
data suggest a continuation of these flow patterns in December.
Most measures of household debt quality suggest little change. The debt-service
burden is estimated to have remained about steady in the fourth quarter at
13-1/4 percent of income, up from several years ago but still a percentage point
below the peak of the mid-1980s. In addition, bankruptcies continued to fall in
the third quarter. Call Report data on household credit quality were mixed last
quarter. The delinquency rate on home mortgage loans remained near the
historically low level reached in the first half of the year; the broader measure
compiled by the Mortgage Bankers' Association also changed very little. The
Call Report delinquency rate on consumer loans edged up slightly on balance
last quarter, as did Moody's index of credit card delinquencies for October.
Delinquency rates on auto loans at captive finance companies also rose slightly
last quarter.
Rising rates on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages last month do not
appear to have cooled mortgage activity appreciably. The four-week moving
average of the volatile MBA mortgage purchase loan index has risen of late,
though it remains below its recent July peak. Refinancing activity appears to
have reached a trough. With housing activity down only slightly to date,
mortgage debt growth remained strong in the third quarter, at a 10 percent rate,
and is expected to be well maintained this quarter. Growth in consumer credit
appears to be in line with the 5-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter.

Government Finance
Treasury. The results of the Treasury's mid-quarter refunding in November
were mixed. Although bidding for the five-year note was somewhat tepid, the
reopening of the ten-year note the following day elicited considerable demand,
as indicated by a high bid-to-cover ratio and a stop-out rate slightly below the
market yield just prior to the auction. The Treasury is widely expected to cut
back on auctions of two-year notes and year bills as the next step in adapting to
continuing surpluses and debt paydowns. The cutbacks will enable the Treasury
to keep up its issuance of three- and six-month bills.
In the bill sector, the Treasury has maintained the size of the weekly offerings of
three- and six-month bills at $17 billion in order to build its cash balance before
year-end. In addition, as largely expected, the Treasury auctioned a 43-day cash
management bill in early December, the second such bill issued in the fourth
quarter. The cash management bills, both of which mature in January 2000,
provided the Treasury with $44 billion of additional financing through year-end.
The Board staff projects a large enough surplus in December that, absent a
change in auction schedules, the Treasury's year-end cash balance will be
noticeably above its announced target level of $70 billion.
Federal agency. Debt issuance by GSEs remained brisk over the intermeeting
period, importantly reflecting the efforts to capture some of the liquidity
premium lost by Treasury securities as issuance is trimmed. Fannie Mae
reopened a five-year benchmark note for $4.5 billion, while Freddie Mac
reopened a ten-year reference note for $3 billion and issued $2 billion of its first
thirty-year bond. To date, Freddie Mac has issued more than $75 billion of
reference securities and expects to issue an additional $65 billion of those
securities next year. Fannie Mae has issued nearly $110 billion of benchmark
securities and reportedly plans to issue an additional $50 billion next year.
Spreads between the yields on benchmark agency securities and those on
Treasuries are between 53 and 65 basis points in the five- to ten-year sector,
largely unchanged from the last FOMC meeting.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recently made some changes in their programs for
benchmark and reference securities in an attempt to render such instruments
even better substitutes for Treasury securities. They also introduced programs
under which they will issue short-dated securities to fill the gap caused by
shrinking Treasury supplies.
State and local. Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds totaled
$17-1/2 billion in November, matching the October pace. A modest slowdown
in issuance to raise new capital was offset by a pickup in refundings. So far in
December, the volume of offerings has been somewhat lighter than in

November, and market participants expect little activity in the second half of the
month.
In November, relatively strong supply and soft demand kept yields on long-term
municipal bonds high. Evidently, investor concerns about rising rates have led
to sizable net outflows from tax-exempt mutual funds since the summer. The
ratio of the thirty-year revenue bond yield to the thirty-year Treasury yield
remains relatively elevated.
The generally strong credit quality of municipal issuers has shown further
improvement in recent months. Standard and Poor's continued to upgrade more
issues than it downgraded last month, both in terms of the number and dollar
volume. Even in the not-for-profit health care sector, which has accounted for
the bulk of downgrades in the past year, conditions are expected to improve with
the recently signed legislation to expand Medicare funds, which should reduce
some of the pressures on the revenues of health care issuers.
Money and Bank Credit
Despite the recent pickup in currency, M2 continued to grow moderately,
increasing at about a 5 percent rate in November. Growth of M2 has likely been
restrained by the steady rise in its opportunity cost, as the rise in most deposit
and money fund rates has lagged earlier policy tightenings.
In contrast, M3 accelerated sharply last month, with growth in the non-M2
components surging at a 48 percent annual rate. The growth was fueled by an
extraordinary runup in large time deposits, which soared at a 58 percent rate in
November following strong gains in October. U.S. offices of foreign banks--
mostly European institutions--have accounted for about two-thirds of the
increase in large time deposits in the past two months, with almost half of these
funds being used to pay down net borrowing from related foreign offices.
Conversations with several large foreign banks suggest that they have found it
cheaper to raise funds in U.S. markets. Domestic banks, in contrast, have
increased their net borrowing from foreign offices while also expanding their
large time deposits. Other components of M3, including institutional money
market mutual funds, Eurodollars, and RPs, also grew rapidly in November.
Available data for early December indicate these patterns have continued.
The runup in banks' managed liabilities may have helped fund the rapid
accumulation of vault cash as well as a sharp pickup in bank credit growth.
Bank credit expanded at an 18-1/4 percent rate in November, owing to a fairly
widespread rise in loans. Business lending has been particularly strong: C&I
loans grew at a 23 percent rate in November, a monthly pace not seen since the
fall of 1998, when capital market funding dried up. A small part of the C&I
volume reflects the rebooking of loans from offshore to domestic offices for

possible use as collateral for discount window borrowings. Banks also added to
their holdings of consumer and real estate loans, in part reflecting lower levels of
securitization. To help finance their loan growth, banks sold off some of their
holdings of U.S. government securities last month.
Measures of asset quality at banks remain generally strong. As noted, Call
Report data for the third quarter indicate that delinquency rates on business loans
continued their gradual rise, while those on real estate loans edged down further,
with these series generally remaining at very low levels. In contrast,
delinquency rates on consumer loans stayed at the fairly high level of the
previous two years. Nearly all bank assets remain at well-capitalized banks.
Although the capital buffer--the difference between actual capital levels and
minimal capital requirements--at the largest such banks rose somewhat over the
year, it remains considerably below the buffer enjoyed by other well-capitalized
banks. Banks continued to record strong earnings in the third quarter, but higher
interest rates and a few early profit warnings have raised investor concerns about
a pinch in fourth-quarter earnings.

Appendix
Review of Debt and Money Growth in 1999
Aggregate debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is estimated to have increased near the
top of its 3-to-7 percent growth range again in 1999. The composition of borrowing
shifted further toward the private sectors, which were financing strong growth in
spending: Household debt accelerated from 1998 and business debt growth held steady
at a robust pace, while state and local debt growth waned and the federal government
paid down debt.
Growth of the monetary aggregates moderated somewhat relative to the rapid
expansion of 1998. Contributing to the deceleration were an unwinding of the unusual
liquidity demands that developed late in 1998 and an increase in market interest rates.
As expected at the beginning of the year, both M2 and M3 overshot their annual ranges
again in 1999. Those ranges were chosen as benchmarks for monetary expansion at
price stability, but inflation ran a little above the rate associated with approximate price
stability, and the output assumptions upon which the ranges were built several years
ago did not allow for the substantial pickup in the pace of potential economic growth in
recent years.
Domestic Nonfinancial Debt
The advance in domestic nonfinancial sector debt in 1999, estimated at 6-1/2 percent
on a fourth-quarter basis, included an increase of 9-1/2 percent in the nonfederal sector
and a decline of 2-1/2 percent in federal government debt, reflecting the growing
budget surplus.
In the household sector, home mortgage debt growth picked up to 10-1/4 percent as
housing activity remained at a high level despite a considerable rise in mortgage
interest rates over the year. Consumer credit grew 6-1/4 percent in 1999, fueled in part
by further strong gains in personal consumption expenditures for durable goods.
Household sector debt growth, at 9 percent, again outpaced increases in disposable
personal income, but measures of household credit quality show virtually no
deterioration. Mortgage foreclosures, bankruptcies, and delinquency rates on credit
cards and auto loans all were down significantly from 1998 levels.
The debt of nonfinancial businesses is estimated to have grown at a brisk 10-3/4 pace
again in 1999. Most borrowers found credit readily available, though terms and
standards for businesses were noticeably tighter than they had been before the financial
market disruptions in the fall of 1998. To some extent, wider risk spreads reflected a
greater appreciation of borrower risk and a reduced lender appetite for taking that risk
in the wake of the 1998 disruptions. In addition, at times this year, spreads came under
pressure from concerns about liquidity and access to funding over the century date
change.
Corporate demands for external funds were boosted by a further widening of the gap
between corporate capital outlays and internal funds, and by a large volume of equity
retirements resulting from stock repurchase programs and mergers and acquisitions.
Overall, net corporate bond issuance, especially by investment-grade firms, was robust.

III-A-2
With default rates on junk bonds rising sharply and yield spreads remaining elevated
over the year, issuance of those securities fell more than 25 percent, albeit from a heady
pace last year.
Commercial mortgage lending was fairly strong again in 1999. Banks and life
insurance companies provided a larger share of funds than in recent years, as other
investors demonstrated reluctance to absorb lower-rated tranches of commercial
mortgage-backed securities. REITs generally found the capital markets far less
accommodative than in past years, and their pullback in both debt and equity
investments in commercial real estate left a gap that more traditional lenders found
opportune to fill.
State and local government debt expanded 4 percent this year, well off the pace of
1998. Borrowing for new capital edged up, but the roughly full percentage-point rise in
municipal bond yields over the year, and a diminishing pool of bonds eligible for
refunding in advance of retirement dates, held down refunding activity.
Depository Credit
After increasing for several years, the share of total lending accounted for by
depository institutions leveled out in 1999. Growth in credit extended by those
institutions subsided to 6-1/4 percent this year, from its recent high of 8-1/2 percent in
1998. Bank credit slowed considerably early in the year, as the surge in holdings of
non-U.S. government securities, business loans, and security loans associated with the
fall 1998 disruptions in securities markets unwound; however, lending picked up again
very late in the year, owing in part to Y2K factors. Adjusted for mark-to-market
accounting rules, bank credit growth retreated from 10-1/4 percent in 1998 to
5-1/4 percent this year.
Surveys indicate that large commercial banks tightened standards and terms for C&I
loans modestly, on balance, over the year, amid signs of some deterioration from the
recent high levels of credit quality. Terms and conditions were similarly reported to be
a bit stricter, on balance, for both credit card and other consumer loans.
Monetary Aggregates
M3 rose 7-1/2 percent in 1999, well above the FOMC's range of 2 to 6 percent, but far
below the nearly 11 percent pace recorded in 1998. M3 growth retreated in early 1999,
as the surge in depository credit in the final quarter of 1998 unwound and depository
institutions curbed their issuance of the managed liabilities included in that aggregate.
In addition, the expansion of institutional money funds slowed with the ebbing of
heightened preferences for liquid assets. However, M3 growth surged again in the
fourth quarter of 1999, as loan growth picked up and banks funded the increase largely
with large time deposits and other managed liabilities in M3. Some of the step-up in
issuance of large time deposits by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks was
used to augment the liquidity of their foreign parents and affiliates over the century
date change, apparently because it was cheaper to fund in U.S. markets. This issuance
may have been facilitated to the extent that wholesale money holders were moving to
M3 liabilities, including institutional money funds, to build up precautionary Y2K
liquidity.

III-A-3
Like M3, M2 expanded more slowly this year. Both the easing of elevated demands for
liquid assets that had boosted M2 in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the rise in its
opportunity cost during 1999 depressed M2 growth relative to last year. That rise in
opportunity cost also helped halt the decline in M2 velocity that began in mid-1997;
velocity is estimated to have risen about 1 percent over the second half of 1999. M2
growth in 1999, at 6 percent, exceeded the FOMC's range of 1 percent to 5 percent.
Within M2, currency demand surged over the year as a whole, likely reflecting in part
brisk retail sales and, late in the year, some Y2K-related precautionary holdings. The
strong expansion of currency more than offset the effects of continued proliferation of
retail sweep programs on the monetary base, which grew 11-1/2 percent.'
1 New sweep programs totaled $49-1/2 billion in 1999, down from $64 billion in 1998.

somewhat larger than in August. Although the nominal deficit widened $35
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter, NIPA real net
exports were less of a drag on U.S. GDP growth than in the previous two
quarters as real export growth picked up and import growth continued at the

The value of exports eased back in September from a peak level in August,
reflecting primarily swings in deliveries of aircraft. The value of exports in the
third quarter was 3 1/2 percent higher than in the second quarter. The strongest
increases were in capital goods (aircraft, semiconductors, and industrial
machinery). Exports of industrial materials also rose briskly (particularly
organic chemicals), and there were smaller increases in all other major trade
categories. By area, most of the increase in exports went to Mexico and
emerging market economies in Asia.
The value of imports was about the same in September as in August. Declines
in imports of computers and automotive products were offset by increases in the
value of imported oil and in most other trade categories. In the third quarter, the
value of imports was 5 1/2 percent higher than in the second quarter, with notable
increases in all major trade categories except food.
Trade data for October will be released on December 16 and will be reported in
the Greenbook Supplement.

Oil Prices

IV-5
Quantity and price of imported oil. A small decline in the quantity of oil
imported in September (due mainly to a seasonal drop in consumption) was
more than offset by higher prices. The price of imported oil rose to over $20 per
barrel in September, up more than $1.50 per barrel from August. For the third
quarter, the U.S. oil import price rose nearly $4 per barrel, reflecting
strengthening world demand and ongoing production restraint from OPEC.
The price of imported oil increased further in October and November (BLS
data). The relatively minor increase in November-the smallest since
June-primarily reflects declines in spot oil prices during October amid market
concerns that OPEC might increase production. Since June, the price of
imported oil has risen about $6 per barrel as world oil production continues to
fall short of strengthening world demand. OPEC compliance with production
targets has remained high. This, together with Iraq's decision to withhold
exports until the U.N.'s oil-for-food program was renewed, pushed up spot oil
prices in late November to levels not seen since 1996. In November, the
monthly average spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose over $2 to
$22.50 per barrel. Spot WTI is currently trading above $26 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of non-oil goods imports
increased 0.3 percent in November, faster than in the previous two months, led
by rising prices of coffee and industrial materials. For October/November
combined, non-oil import prices rose 1.8 percent at an annual rate, the first
increase recorded in four years. Prices of imported computers and
semiconductors declined only slightly in October/November. In contrast, prices
of imported core goods (which exclude computers, semiconductors, and oil)
moved up 2.2 percent at an annual rate in October/November, led by a strong
increase in prices of industrial materials and a swing from negative to positive
price changes for imported machinery.
Prices of total goods exports increased moderately in November. For
October/November combined, export prices rose 2 percent at an annual rate,
compared with a 1/2 percent annual rate increase in the third quarter and negative
changes in previous quarters. Prices of agricultural products were about
unchanged in October/November from the third quarter, and prices of computers
and semiconductors declined moderately. In contrast, the price of exported core
goods rose nearly 3 3/4 percent in October/November, led by continued strong
increases in prices of industrial materials (primarily paper, metals, and
chemicals) and, to a lesser extent, by an increase in the price of exported
automotive products and consumer goods.

IV-6
U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit increased to nearly $360 billion at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 1999. Most of the increase was
accounted for by a larger deficit for goods and services. The deficit for
investment income widened modestly. Income receipts on U.S.-owned assets
abroad rose slightly-both direct investment receipts and private portfolio
receipts. Income payments on foreign-owned assets in the United States
increased more than income receipts-all in portfolio payments. Direct
investment income payments declined slightly from a high level in the second
quarter. U.S. portfolio assets abroad and foreign portfolio assets in the United
States both rose in the third quarter, as did the rates of return on these assets.
Net unilateral transfers were unchanged in the second quarter, as higher private
remittances and other transfers were offset by lower U.S. government grant
disbursements.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States rose in October 1999 after a
modest decline in September (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International
Transactions table). Sizeable gains were recorded in Argentine and Japanese
reserves; the OPEC countries also increased their reserves in concert with the
sharp increase in oil prices. Mexico, Brazil, and Korea drew on their U.S.
reserves in October, although partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York show some rebuilding in Brazilian and Korean reserves in November.
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private-sector foreigners remained strong in
October (line 4). A sharp decline in Treasury holdings (line 4a) was more than
offset by net purchases of other securities. The net sales of Treasuries in
October were mainly attributable to a single hedge fund in the Caribbean that
largely reversed its August purchases of Treasuries. Most of the large net
purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds other than Treasuries in October were
accounted for by net purchases from Japan and financial centers in Europe and
the Caribbean (lines 4b-d). As has been common throughout the year, agency
bonds (line 4b) made up a significant share of foreign purchases of U.S.
securities.
U.S. investors purchased foreign bonds and stocks on net in October (line 5).
Perhaps attracted by the rally in Japanese equities this year, net purchases of
Japanese stocks more than accounted for total net purchases in October.
According to the Treasury International Capital (TIC) data, U.S. investors sold
European equities on net. However, these reported net sales probably reflect
portfolio re-balancing by U.S. investors, whose foreign holdings increased
markedly following several large equity-financed takeovers of U.S. companies
by European multinationals. While foreign equity acquired through such stock
swaps is not reported in the TIC data, subsequent sales of these securities are
recorded. BEA estimates that these flows, which are included in line 9, totaled
more than $100 billion in the first three quarters of 1999.
Modest inflows through banking offices in the United States were reported in
October (line 3). September data were revised from outflows of $20 billion to
outflows of $32 billion, largely due to a reporting error by a branch of a foreign
bank.
Recently released balance of payments data for the third quarter show continued
robust direct investment flows, with outflows exactly offsetting inflows (lines 6
and 7). As of the third quarter, direct investment into the United States in 1999
has already surpassed the record set in 1998 (line 7). U.S. direct investment
abroad has also been strong this year, and is well on its way to setting its own
record (line 6). The growing number of large international mergers and

IV-8
acquisitions has been primarily responsible for the sizeable direct investment
flows.
The statistical discrepancy (last line) was negative in the third quarter of 1999,
as it has been in recent quarters, indicating some combination of over-recorded
net capital inflows or under-recorded net exports. While there are likely to be
errors in reporting both financial and current transactions, the recent robust
merger activity has probably strained the financial reporting system, suggesting
that reported capital inflows are more likely to be suspect.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the November FOMC meeting, the nominal exchange value of the dollar
has appreciated 1.2 percent, on balance, in terms of the major currencies index.
A 1.3 percent depreciation of the dollar versus the Japanese yen was more than
offset by appreciations of 2.8 and 1.3 percent against the euro and the Canadian
dollar, respectively. The exchange value of the dollar dipped slightly against the
currencies of other important trading partners, with an appreciation of the dollar
vis-à-vis the Indonesian rupiah and the Mexican peso only partially countering a
depreciation versus both the Brazilian real and the Korean won.

September October November December
The sharpest drop in the dollar's exchange value against the yen over the inter-
meeting period took place in one hour on Friday, November 26, during trading
that was characterized by market participants as thin and illiquid. During that
hour, the yen appreciated 2.7 percent versus the dollar and 2.8 percent versus the
euro. The following Monday and Tuesday, Japanese officials intervened,
buying both dollars and euros, but their actions had no lasting effect. In
subsequent weeks, however, the dollar has appreciated marginally versus the
yen.
During the inter-meeting period, the euro hit a new low, falling below parity
with the dollar on three successive business days (December 2, 3 and 6) before
recovering briefly following the release of better-than-expected data on German
October factory orders. To explain the recent bout of weakness in the euro,
some market participants cited increased skepticism about the commitment of

IV-11
European governments to a unified, market-oriented economy. This
reassessment followed the German government's rescue of a bankrupt
construction firm and its opposition to a British firm's hostile takeover bid for a
German telecommunications company, as well as market rumors that the
Governor of the Bank of France intervened to prevent a Dutch bank from
purchasing a French bank. A row between continental E.U. members and the
United Kingdom over a pan-European withholding tax on interest earnings also
heightened concerns about European policy making.

Bellwether bond yields rose 17 to 21 basis points across Europe, in the inter-
meeting period, as more signs of a cyclical upswing in European economies
appeared. Switzerland deviated from this trend, with the yield on its ten-year
government bond shedding seven basis points, as the Swiss National Bank did
not follow the European Central Bank's November rate increase. In Japan,
government officials stated that net new issuance of Japanese government bonds
to finance next year's initial budget will total about ¥30 trillion, and announced
that an increased portion of the total would be in the four to six year maturity to
alleviate upward pressure on longer dated Japanese bond yields. Japanese ten-
year government bond yields declined modestly over the period, while four-year
and six-year bond yields rose 12 and 9 basis points, respectively.

have outstanding sovereign bonds demoninated in foreign currencies.
In emerging market economies, stripped spreads of sovereign bond yields
continued to fall over the inter-meeting period, with the Emerging Market Bond
Index spread tumbling 75 basis points. In part, this decline owed to an
announcement that Brazil would issue $4 billion to $6 billion in non-
collateralized global bonds in 2000, a portion of which will be swapped for
outstanding Brady bonds; for the period, Brazilian Brady spreads fell 189 basis

points. Mexico saw its Brady bond spread fall 183 basis points, while Argentine
Brady spreads tightened by nearly 100 basis points. Mexican and Brazilian
equity prices surged 9 and 11 percent, respectively, but Argentine share prices
declined almost four percent. Equity prices in most Asian economies advanced
during the period, with Korean stocks a notable exception.
On December 3 and 10, in order to provide additional dollar liquidity to the
Brazilian money market over the century date change, Brazil's central bank
auctioned a total of $1.3 billion of U.S. dollar repurchase agreements for
delivery on December 29, with $800 million to be repurchased on January 5 and
$500 million on January 10.
In other actions by foreign central banks, the Bank of Canada raised its Bank
rate 25 basis points, to 5 percent, and its overnight target rate a like amount to
4.75 percent, immediately following the FOMC's November decision. On
November 23, the central bank of Ecuador nearly doubled its interbank lending
rate to 160 percent from 90 percent in an effort to support the sucre. On
December 9, the Turkish central bank announced a new crawling exchange rate
peg, devised in conjunction with an IMF program. The new peg is designed to
reduce gradually inflation expectations over a period of 18 months, at which
time the plan calls for the Turkish lira to float within widening trading bands.
Turkish equity and bond prices immediately rose following the announcement.
The price of gold has fallen 3.8 percent since the last FOMC meeting, to $280
per ounce. The commodity's sharpest fall during the period occurred after the
Dutch central bank announced on December 6 that it would sell 300 tons of its
gold holdings over the next five years. These prospective sales fall within the
scope of the arrangement announced on September 26 by the European Central
Bank and 14 national central banks, including the Netherlands Bank. The
participating parties agreed to limit their gold sales to 2,000 tons over five years.
Together with previously announced plans of the Bank of England and the Swiss
National Bank, the Dutch plan means that 1,965 tons of the 2,000 tons have been
accounted for.
The Desk did not
intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

IV-14
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the November Greenbook generally suggest expanding real
economic activity in the foreign industrial countries. In the euro area, growth
picked up sharply in the third quarter and most forward-looking indicators
suggest further strength. In the United Kingdom and Canada, the expansion of
real economic activity in the third quarter exceeded the strong second-quarter
rate. In contrast, Japanese economic activity in the third quarter stalled
following the surge in GDP in the first half of 1999.
Inflation remains quiescent in the foreign industrial countries, although higher
oil prices continue to put upward pressure on headline inflation. Euro-area
harmonized CPI inflation continued to climb in October but, at 1.4 percent,
remained comfortably below the 2 percent ceiling set by the ECB. Canadian
core inflation has nudged up recently, but is still below the midpoint of the Bank
of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target. U.K. inflation remains close to
2 percent. Japanese core consumer prices remained flat in November, while
wholesale prices continued to decline.
In Japan, real GDP fell 3.8 percent (SAAR) during the third quarter, after rising
in the first two quarters of 1999. Domestic demand led the way down, shaving
5.3 percentage points off growth, while net exports added 1.4 percentage points
to growth. Private consumption and all types of investment (private residential
and non-residential and public) fell. Revisions to earlier quarters' GDP growth
were substantial, including a downward revision from 8 percent to 6.3 percent
for the first quarter and upward revision from 0.4 percent to 3.9 percent for the
second quarter.
The decline in third-quarter real GDP was surprising in light of relatively strong
production indicators. Although industrial production fell 2.3 percent (SA) in
October from the previous month, this was due largely to a variation in the
number of working days in the month and followed an increase of 4 percent in
the third quarter from its level in the second quarter. MITI is expecting a
rebound in industrial production of a hefty 5 percent in November. The BoJ's
December Tankan improved to -26 from -32 in September, indicating improved
business sentiment for the fourth consecutive quarter.
The Japanese unemployment rate in October remained steady at 4.6 percent,
while the offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings
relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) rose to 0.48, a bit
above the record low of 0.46 in August. Demand indicators for the fourth
quarter are scant, but those that are available paint a pessimistic picture.
Housing starts and new car registrations were each down 10 percent in October
from the previous month, perhaps as a result of employment concerns. The

IV-15
November Tokyo core CPI was nearly unchanged (SA) from the previous month
and was down 0.3 percent (NSA) from a year earlier.

The Japanese cabinet announced details of the much awaited supplemental
budget for FY2000 on November 11. The broad package of measures is valued
at¥18 trillion ($171 billion equivalent), with a "real water" content estimated to
be about ¥7 trillion, or 1.4 percent of GDP. Most of the real water spending is
on "social infrastructure," which includes both traditional public works and
spending on high technology and research-oriented projects. Other measures
include financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, assistance for home
buyers, funds to start an elderly-care insurance program, and a jobs program for
the hiring and re-training of workers. The government has said it plans to issue
mostly five-year bonds to fund the package in order to avoid raising rates on ten-
year bonds.

In the euro area, preliminary data indicate that real GDP expanded at a very
healthy 4 percent rate (SAAR) in the third quarter on the back of strong domestic
demand and net exports. In Germany, real GDP rose 2.9 percent (SAAR) in the
third quarter, led by net exports with consumer, fixed investment and
government spending all contributing positively to growth. Inventory
investment provided a significant drag. In France, real GDP rose 4.2 percent
(SAAR) in the third quarter and-as in Germany-net exports made the biggest
contribution, but domestic demand also contributed positively while inventory
investment contributed negatively. Third-quarter industrial production
(excluding construction) for the area as a whole was up 0.6 percent (SA) from
the previous quarter and 1 percent from a year ago.
Data on current economic activity as well as recent information on economic
sentiment and new orders suggest a further pickup in activity in the final quarter
of 1999. In Germany, industrial production rose 1.7 percent (SA) in October
from September on the back of a surge in capital goods production, much of
which is usually exported. The volume of industry orders rose 3.2 percent in
October after slumping in September. A hefty 5.4 percent gain in domestic

IV-17
orders, which provided an early indication that domestic demand finally may be
strengthening, mostly accounted for October's pickup. Foreign orders, which
had fueled the sharp rise in manufacturers orders since April, rose only 0.5
percent but remained at a level nearly 9 percent above the second-quarter
average. In Italy, industrial production rose 0.4 percent (SA) in October.
Economic sentiment has been increasing in most of the countries in recent
months, with improvement in all components of the index-industrial, consumer,
and construction.
In October, the harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area dropped to
9.9 percent, the first time the rate has been below 10 percent since 1992. (In
constructing the harmonized unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes
national statistics to International Labor Organization definitions.) In France,
Germany and Italy, unemployment rates remain above the euro-area average,
although they have declined somewhat more in France and Italy since the
beginning of the year.

Euro-area harmonized CPI inflation continues to creep up but remains
comfortably below the 2 percent ceiling set by the ECB. In October, euro-area
consumer prices rose 1.4 percent (yr/yr). Noticeable differences still exist
among individual countries with inflation rates in Germany, Austria and France
remaining considerably below those in Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal.
The euro-area current account surplus with the rest of the world was slightly
above $37 billion for the first nine months of 1999, down significantly from
around $51 billion over the same period in 1998.

On December 2, the Governing Council of the ECB announced that its M3
growth reference value for next year will remain at 4 1/2 percent, despite the fact
that euro-area M3 growth has consistently exceeded the reference value since
January-with most estimates for the August-October period showing growth of
6 percent.
Economic activity in the United Kingdom continued to strengthen in the third
quarter, with real GDP registering growth of 3.6 percent (SAAR). This growth
reflected in part a sharp pickup in inventory accumulation as consumer spending
moderated somewhat and investment spending remained subdued. A surge in
export growth more than offset strong import growth, and net exports made a
positive contribution to growth for the second consecutive quarter.
Data for the fourth quarter are limited but suggest that activity continues at a
robust pace. Industrial production edged up in October and the average volume
of retail sales picked up in October to a level 0.9 percent above the third-quarter
average. Business sentiment in the industrial sector has eased somewhat from
the levels recorded earlier in the fall, but purchasing managers surveys point to
continued expansion in manufacturing industries and especially strong activity in
the service sector in November.

Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate edged down to 4.1 percent in November, the lowest rate in nearly 20 years,
and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate remained at a
record low 5.9 percent for the August-October period. Average annual earnings
growth increased to 4.9 percent for the three months centered in October.

IV-21
Business surveys suggest that recruitment difficulties are intensifying and wage
costs are rising.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
rates) remains below the official target of 2.5 percent, but producer input prices
have risen noticeably since April.
Real GDP in Canada rose 4.7 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter. After acting
as a significant drag on growth in the previous quarter, net exports made a
sizeable contribution in the third quarter, led by a surge in automotive exports to
the United States. Consumer spending also posted another advance in the form
of large gains in purchases of durable goods such as motor vehicles, furniture,
and appliances. Investment spending slowed sharply, as business spending on
computers leveled off after surging in the second quarter. Inventory investment
fell off, partly due to stronger than expected external and household demand.
Strong economic growth has contributed favorably to labor market
developments in recent months. Employment rose a hefty 0.4 percent in
November, after posting large gains in September and October. The
unemployment rate in November fell to 6.9 percent, an eighteen-year low.
The twelve-month change in core inflation fell from 1.8 percent in September to
1.6 percent in October, possibly suggesting that the effect on inflation of last
year's depreciation of the Canadian dollar has started to weaken. Even though
core inflation was below the midpoint of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to
3 percent target range, the Bank raised short-term interest rates 25 basis points
on November 18, matching the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve a day
earlier.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, the Mexican economy continues to grow at a strong pace,
while in Argentina the latest industrial production data provide further evidence
of a nascent recovery. The picture in Brazil appears more mixed, as economic
activity weakened in the third quarter, although there are signs of modest
improvement so far in the fourth quarter. Inflation rates continue to edge down
across the region, with the exception of Brazil, where upward pressure on prices
may be increasing.
In developing Asia, recent indicators suggest that China, Hong Kong and Korea
continue to recover at a robust pace, while economic activity in Taiwan appears
to have rebounded from the September earthquake. In contrast, growth in the
ASEAN region slowed significantly, albeit from an unsustainable pace.
Deflation appears to be easing in China and Hong Kong, and inflation rates
remain low elsewhere in the region, although there are signs that strong growth
in Korea may be putting some upward pressure on prices.
In Brazil, real GDP fell almost 1 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter, following
two quarters of growth. The decline was led by a fall in manufacturing output,
which was partly offset by growth in mining and services. Industrial production
data for October were more promising, showing a monthly rise of 1.6 percent
(SA). Brazil's trade performance continues to disappoint; available information
through October suggests that while export volumes have grown modestly in
recent months, export prices have remained weak.
Consumer prices rose about 1 percent (SA) in both October and November from
the previous month, bringing the 12-month rate of inflation to nearly 9 percent in
November. The steep monthly rises were largely due to sharp increases in food
and energy prices. Analysts now expect 12-month inflation to hit 9 percent in
December, which would surpass the midpoint of the government's inflation
target range of 6 percent to 10 percent.
In November, the Brazilian central bank's monetary policy committee decided to
keep unchanged its target overnight interest rate at 19 percent and to drop the
downward "tilt" it had introduced at its early October meeting, citing concerns
over the likely impact on inflation of increases in government-controlled prices

While further progress on fiscal reform is needed, in November Congress
approved a reform aimed at stabilizing the deficit of the social security system
for private workers at 1 percent of GDP in coming years. Brazil's government is
on track to meet the year-end fiscal targets set in its IMF program.

Mexico continued to grow rapidly during the third quarter, with real GDP up
8.7 percent (SAAR). Although booming exports remain the main engine of
growth, driven in large part by a strong U.S. economy, there are now indications
that the contribution of domestic demand might be increasing as well. The
strong growth is beginning to fuel imports, which rose roughly 5 percent (SA) in
October, while exports were little changed. This resulted in a considerable
widening of the trade deficit in October. The current account deficit widened in
the third quarter to $13 1/2 billion (AR) from about $12 billion in the second
quarter, but still down significantly from a deficit of $16 billion last year.
Inflation remains on a downward trend with a 12-month rate of under 14 percent
in November.

In mid-November, the new budget for 2000 was presented to Congress. Like the
1999 budget, it is austere, with a target deficit of 1 percent of GDP; the target for
the primary budget is for a surplus of about 2.8 percent of GDP. The budget
assumes annual real GDP growth of 4.5 percent, year-end inflation of
10 percent, an average exchange rate of 10.4 pesos per dollar over the year, and a
current account deficit of $15 billion.

In Argentina, recent industrial production data provide additional evidence that
the economy may be recovering. Industrial production rose 2.5 percent (SA) in
October from the previous month, faster than the 1.5 percent pace recorded in
the third quarter. In October, the trade deficit was $1.1 billion (SAAR), little
changed from the third-quarter average. Both exports and imports continue to
fall compared with last year's levels, albeit at a slower pace than in previous
months. Further declines in consumer prices point to some weakness in
economic activity, however; consumer prices edged down in November and
have fallen about 1 percent over the past twelve months.

Financial markets have been guardedly upbeat over the past month, although
much uncertainty remains about the economic policies of the new president,
Fernando de la Rua, and his finance minister, Jose Luis Machinea. The
Argentine stock market has sustained the rally that began immediately before the
election and now stands about 2 percent above its mid-October level and
20 percent above the recent trough in July. Short-term domestic interest rates,
which had been falling since late October, turned up again recently, possibly
reflecting continued uncertainty regarding the fiscal budget for 2000 and an
end-of-the-year switch to dollar-denominated assets.

In Venezuela, consumer prices in November were up about 20 percent by
November from a year earlier, slower than the pace recorded earlier in this year.
Weak domestic demand and an overvalued exchange rate appear to be
outweighing the positive effects of higher oil prices. Furthermore, uncertainties
surrounding the new constitution, which went to the population for a vote on
December 15, have created anxiety among domestic and foreign investors.
Despite elevated oil prices, foreign currency reserves have barely increased in
recent months, in part because residents are moving their assets overseas. After
dropping during the late summer and early fall, Brady spreads and domestic
interest rates have turned up over the last month.

In Korea, recovery has continued at a very strong pace. Real GDP increased at
nearly a 14 percent (SAAR) rate in the third quarter, continuing the very rapid
growth of the first half of the year. About two-thirds of the third-quarter growth
was due to increasing domestic demand. Consumption rose at a double-digit
rate for the third consecutive quarter, and fixed investment and inventory
investment also made significant positive contributions to growth. A rapid
increase in exports, led by sales of semiconductors and computed-related
products, also boosted third-quarter growth. Activity appears to have remained
strong early in the fourth quarter: in October, industrial production registered
another substantial increase and the unemployment rate eased further.
With growth so rapid, recent statements by government officials have
increasingly emphasized that the need to contain inflation is a priority of
macroeconomic policy. However, so far, the central bank has not moved to push
up short-term interest rates, probably reflecting concern over the still fragile
health of domestic financial institutions, especially the investment trust
companies which hold most of the ailing Daewoo's debt securities. In addition,
the recent strength of the won should help moderate inflationary pressures.
Although inflation has shown signs of picking up in recent months, the
12-month rate remains below 2 percent.

The ASEAN region saw a slight retrenchment in the third quarter, after
remarkable second-quarter growth. Third-quarter output fell slightly in both
Malaysia and Singapore, following unsustainably strong second-quarter growth.
The slowdown in Singapore came largely as a result of declining market share in
low-end electronics, notably disk-drive production, and weakness in Singapore's
financial services sector. In Malaysia, construction contracted and both
manufacturing and agriculture grew at considerably slower rates than in the
second quarter. Third-quarter Indonesian GDP fell more sharply, reflecting a
number of factors including uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, the
Bank Bali financial scandal, and the crisis in East Timor. The Philippine
economy continued to expand in the third quarter, but somewhat more modestly
than in the first half of the year. Industrial production data for October suggest
that the slowdown across the region may have continued into the fourth quarter.
All the ASEAN countries continued to register healthy trade surpluses. Inflation
remained muted throughout the region.
In recent national elections, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir was re-elected
and the ruling National Front Party maintained its two-thirds majority in
parliament. However, the National Front suffered an erosion of support among
the politically dominant ethnic Malays, following the government's highly
controversial treatment of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
In Indonesia, growing separatist tensions in the oil-rich province of Aceh have
become a new source of political instability.

In China, there are signs that economic activity continued to recover. Industrial
production growth in October was lackluster, although likely depressed by a
week-long holiday during the 50th anniversary celebration of the People's
Republic. Exports, which drove the sharp rise in GDP in the third quarter,
continued to soar, causing the trade surplus to widen further in October and
November. The rate of decline in consumer prices slowed from the third-quarter
average, suggesting some strengthening in private domestic demand. The
authorities continued to try to spur economic growth through expansionary fiscal
and monetary policy; in late November, the central bank cut the bank reserve
ratio from 8 percent to 6 percent, in an effort to boost the growth of the money
supply.

On November 15, China and the United States signed a bilateral agreement on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under the deal,
China has agreed to lower tariffs and remove non-tariff barriers on imports of
agriculture and industrial products, and allow significantly more foreign
investment in China. WTO accession is expected to boost China's long-run
growth prospects, in part by underpinning China's economic reform process,
although there may be some short-run costs associated with the movement of
resources from the import-competing sectors to other sectors of the economy.
Economic activity in Hong Kong continued to rebound at a brisk pace, with real
GDP rising 8.7 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter. The expansion largely
reflected the benefits to Hong Kong's entrepot economy of rapidly rising
regional trade flows, especially flows to and from China. Domestic demand
appears to have been sluggish, however, partly reflecting the negative impact of
relatively high unemployment on consumer sentiment; the unemployment rate
was 6.2 percent (SA) in the August-October period, up slightly from 6.1 percent
in the July-September period. Additionally, high real interest rates remained a
drag on private investment. Consumer prices continued to fall on a 12-month
basis, although the rate of decline eased significantly in October, partly as a
result of higher oil prices. Stock prices have soared in recent weeks, with
technology stocks showing particular strength, buoyed in part by investors'
favorable reaction to the China-U.S. WTO accession agreement.

In Taiwan, GDP contracted by more than 2 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter,
reflecting a major earthquake that hit the island in September, disrupting
economic activity with widespread electricity outages. Economic activity
appears to be recovering rapidly in the fourth quarter, however, with industrial
production rebounding sharply in October. Taiwan's trade and current account
surpluses narrowed sharply in the third quarter as rising imports outpaced
exports, although the trade surplus widened again somewhat in November. The
unemployment rate was 2.9 percent in October (SA), unchanged from the
previous month. Inflation remains very low, with consumer prices actually
falling slightly in November on a 12-month basis.

Russia's economy has continued to recover in recent months, with industrial
production rising 2.6 percent (SA) in October from the previous month, and
monthly consumer price inflation slowing to 1.2 percent (NSA) in November
from 1.4 percent in October. On the fiscal side, reported budget revenues have
been higher than expected, while expenditures have been contained, although
the war in Chechnya has added further uncertainty to the fiscal picture.
Negotiations with the London Club in late November failed to produce an
agreement on the restructuring of $32 billion in commercial Soviet and
post-Soviet era debt, causing Russia to miss a $550 million coupon payment on
Soviet-era debt that was due on December 2. The next tranche from the
$4.5 billion IMF loan approved in August is also pending, but there is little hope
of Russia's receiving the $640 million disbursement before the new year.
