Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity continued to expand rapidly in late 1999 and appears to have
carried a good deal of positive momentum into the current quarter. Consumers
are wealthy and exuberant, and business managers are upbeat about the
prospects for sales. The labor market is widely viewed as very tight, but the
latest readings on wages and consumer inflation have been on the tame side.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand remained strong through year-end. Despite the many reports of
labor shortages, nonfarm payrolls expanded 315,000 in December, and the
unemployment rate held at 4.1 percent for a third month.
Private nonfarm payrolls increased 251,000 in December after having posted
strong gains in November and October; during the second half of the year,
private payrolls rose an average of 202,000 per month, little changed from the
pace in the first half. Over the second half, employment losses in manufacturing
slowed noticeably, and job growth in construction and most service-producing
industries remained robust.
One industry in which hiring has been rather subdued is retail trade. A sizable
increase of 65,000 jobs was registered in December, but this followed two
months of essentially flat employment; over the past five months, employment
gains averaged only 18,000 per month. Nearly half of December's increase
came at eating and drinking establishments, and another large portion was at
automotive dealers and service stations. Among the businesses for which the
holiday shopping season is a heavy hiring period--general merchandise stores,
apparel stores, and miscellaneous retailers--December's increase of 10,000 jobs
brought the average monthly change over the October to December span to just
2,000. This is consistent with reports that shortages among seasonal retail
workers prompted the use of hiring bonuses and deeper merchandise discounts,
as well as higher wages, to attract needed staff.
Elsewhere in the service-producing sector, the services industry added 109,000
jobs in December, just a shade less than the average for the year, with the bulk of
the increase coming in business services. Employment in transportation and
public utilities jumped 32,000, about twice the average pace over the second half
of the year; both the trucking and air transport industries posted sizable gains,
with at least some of the rise in air transport probably associated with a surge in
on-line retailing.
In the goods-producing sector, employment in construction increased 16,000 last
month, a relatively hefty gain on top of November's 55,000. Good weather and

a backlog of projects combined to forestall some of the normal seasonal layoffs
in the construction industry, leading to increases in the sector after seasonal
adjustment. Anecdotal reports of shortages of construction workers, which were
widespread during the peak summer months, have subsided some recently,
probably because of the greater capacity afforded by the seasonal ebbing of
building activity. Since September, a month when the layoffs typically begin,
job gains in this industry have averaged 35,000 per month after seasonal
adjustment.1 In contrast, from March through August, the normal buildup
period, construction employment rose at an average pace of less than 2,000 per
month after seasonal adjustment. In manufacturing, employment was about flat
last month. The downswing in factory jobs that was related to the crisis in Asia
in 1998 appears to have ended, especially in the durable goods industries;
however, the longer-term downtrend in the apparel industry has continued.
Aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls only inched up in December despite the robust employment
gains. On a rounded basis, the implied average workweek held steady at
34.5 hours, but unrounded, it likely fell almost 0.1 hour. For the fourth quarter
as a whole, aggregate hours rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent on the strength
of more sizable gains earlier in the quarter. Adding in supervisory and non-
production workers, hours of all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose
0.2 percent in December and at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth
quarter.
As noted, the unemployment rate held at 4.1 percent in December, an almost
thirty-year low. The labor force participation rate ticked back up to 67.1 percent;
since spiking last January and February, it has fluctuated between 67.0 and
67.1 percent. Both the number of unemployed workers aged 16 to 64 and the
number who report that they want a job but who are not in the labor force moved
lower in December; however, like the official jobless rate, the potential worker
rate changed little over the last five months of 1999.2 Current employees also
seem more confident about alternative job prospects: A proxy for the quit
rate--job leavers unemployed less than five weeks as a percentage of
employment--moved up sharply in December and now stands above its peak in
the previous cycle.
Other indicators show no significant slackening of labor demand or of
diminishing supply constraints. Smoothing through the erratic weekly data, the
1. On a not seasonally adjusted basis, employment in contract construction declined
336,000 from September to December.
2. With the next Employment Situation release, the BLS will publish a seasonally adjusted
series for the number of individuals not in the labor force (aged 16 and older) reporting that they
want a job.

four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has
held below 300,000 since late July. According to the National Federation of
Independent Businesses and the BNA survey of personnel executives, firms
continued to report hiring difficulties, while the Conference Board reported that,
from the worker side, employment opportunities look plentiful. According to
the NFIB's survey, the hiring plans of smaller firms moved above the previous
high for the current expansion. Moreover, after a slight dip last fall, the forward-
looking readings on expected labor market conditions from the Michigan Survey
Research Center and the Conference Board have rebounded to highly favorable
levels.
Industrial Production
Industrial production posted gains of 0.4 percent in December and November on
the heels of a large increase in October that was partly a bounce back from the
effects of Hurricane Floyd. All told, the index rose at an annual rate of
6.6 percent in the fourth quarter. The output of utilities was up sharply last
month; production had been low in the prior two months when the weather was
unseasonably warm. Manufacturing output, which rose a modest 0.2 percent in
December, posted a substantial 7.2 percent gain in the fourth quarter. The
factory operating rate ended the year at 80.3 percent, about 0.4 percentage point
higher than a year earlier but below its long-run average.
The output of motor vehicles and parts fell in December, in part, because Ford
and GM slowed some assembly lines as dealers sought to shed excessive stocks

of selected models. Data for the first three weeks of this month indicate that the
industry has ramped production back up to a level just above the November
high. Current schedules for the first quarter as a whole, which are at a
13.1 million unit rate, are only slightly below the already strong fourth-quarter
pace and reflect the industry's expectation of continued strength in light vehicle
sales. However, GM has indicated that if its dealer inventories are still
excessive by the end of this quarter, it will cut production significantly in the
second quarter.
Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing IP rose 0.4 percent in December after
having posted strong gains in the preceding two months. Output increased at
moderate to strong rates in most industries, with the notable exception of civilian
aircraft and parts; Boeing's production schedules suggest that output in this
sector will continue to slide, as it has for more than a year. Strong domestic
demand and improving export growth have contributed to the recovery
elsewhere in manufacturing. Notably, production of industrial chemicals,
primary metals, and other internationally traded industrial materials increased
substantially in the fourth quarter and over the year.
The output of high-tech industries was restrained in the second half of the year
by Y2K, with the effect most noticeable in the fourth-quarter, when IP for this
group slowed to an annual rate of 31 percent after having risen at close to a
50 percent pace during the previous two quarters. The production of
communications equipment expanded at a less rapid rate from August through
November than had been the case earlier in the year--with at least some of the
deceleration attributable to Y2K effects--but it picked up again in December. A
slowdown in the production of large servers developed during the third quarter
and spread to other types of computing equipment in the fourth quarter. Part of
the deceleration seems to have been the direct result of a Y2K-related drop in
demand. However, chip makers overestimated the size of the demand decline,
and the resulting shortage of selected memory chips weakened computer
production even further.3 After having slowed sharply in August and September,
semiconductor output reversed itself dramatically in the fourth quarter, as the
chip shortage drove up DRAM prices and encouraged a step-up in production.
Elsewhere, production of drugs and of some foods jumped noticeably. These are
industries in which we expected increases to meet Y2K-related stockbuilding by
consumers.
3. Gateway, in particular, blames chip shortages at Intel for some of its low fourth-quarter
production. Although Intel, in an earlier press release, asserted that the ramp-up of production
over the quarter eliminated any parts shortages, Gateway has announced that it will no longer
rely exclusively on Intel for memory chips.

Looking ahead, the latest National Association of Purchasing Management
survey reported continued expansion of both new orders and export orders in
December. The staffs estimate of real adjusted orders for durable goods placed
in December posted a solid gain after having surged in November. The
December increase in adjusted durable orders was widespread with the
exception of new bookings for computers, which declined for a second month.
Both the NAPM and staff's estimates of orders indicate that manufacturing
output, apart from motor vehicles, should increase appreciably in the near term.

The staff's preliminary estimate of capacity growth in 2000 will be issued with
the February 15 release of the report on January industrial activity. Investment
data and other currently available indicators suggest that manufacturing capacity
is likely to grow around 4 percent this year, compared with the estimated
4-3/4 percent pace in 1999.
Consumer Spending
Consumer spending remained robust through year-end: We estimate that real
outlays for all goods increased 0.7 percent in December and at an annual rate of
6.8 percent in the fourth quarter as a whole. Although Y2K-related spending
may have given an extra boost to outlays, the underlying pace of expenditure
growth still appears to have been very brisk.

Motor vehicles. Sales of light vehicles ended last year on a high note. Adjusted
for shifts in manufacturers' reporting periods, sales of light vehicles in
December were at a remarkably robust annual rate of 17.4 million units, about
250,000 units more than in November. Based on confidential data that show a
step-up in deliveries to fleets, we estimate that retail sales of new light vehicles
were unchanged at a high level in December. Much of the strength in consumer
demand toward the end of the year was for foreign-produced vehicles, whose
sales increased nearly 16 percent in the fourth quarter; sales of domestically
produced vehicles actually dropped 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
For the year as a whole, light vehicle sales reached a record-setting 16.8 million
units, an increase of nearly 700,000 units over the previous record in 1986. The
whopping pace of sales in 1999 continued to be driven by extremely positive
market fundamentals-strong gains in employment, income and wealth, buoyant
consumer attitudes, and favorable prices and financing rates.
The incoming data suggest that these positive forces are not diminishing much.
Both the Michigan SRC index of perceived car-buying conditions and the
Conference Board index of consumers planning to buy a new vehicle within the
next six months, while down from their highs last summer, remain in favorable
territory. Although the level of incentives fell in the fourth quarter, automakers'
estimates suggest that they plan to boost them again in the near term. This
month, GM announced it would be distributing several million coupons for a
$500 discount on most models. When GM last mailed out coupons, in the
second quarter of 1998, Ford and Chrysler quickly responded with similar
programs, and the average value of incentives jumped roughly $400. To date,
the response from GM's competitors has been limited, but we expect that it will
broaden. Looking at prices more broadly, the CPI for new vehicles (including
autos and light trucks) edged down in December and was 0.3 percent below its
year-earlier level.
Other consumer spending. Nominal sales by establishments in the retail
control category jumped 1.4 percent in December, with gains in all major

components.4 Spending at stores in the GAF group (general merchandise,
apparel, furniture, and appliance stores) increased 0.8 percent last month and
7 percent over the twelve months ending in December, beating some industry
forecasts. Spending at food stores surged 2 percent in December. This was the
largest monthly gain of the decade and probably was boosted by Y2K-related
stockpiling by consumers. In addition, spending rose strongly at drug stores and
at gasoline stations, where we also anticipated some Y2K effects. However,
these latter two series are quite erratic (much more so than food stores), and the
December gains are not outliers. According to physical product data from the
Department of Energy, real outlays for gasoline were also up last month, but the
increase in this series was not unusually large.
Data on outlays for services are available only through November. Real PCE for
services increased 0.2 percent that month, as warm weather held down spending
for electricity and natural gas. Temperatures were somewhat closer to normal in
December, and energy items probably provided a small boost to spending.
Excluding energy, outlays for other services continued to rise at a robust pace
through November, with particularly large gains for recreation and brokerage
services; the October-November average for non-energy services was 0.9 percent
above the third-quarter level (not at an annual rate). However, stock market
volume advanced only a small amount in December, suggesting that real
expenditures for brokerage services were little changed.
Real disposable income increased 0.4 percent in November, and the payroll data
for December suggest that it is poised to post another gain. The personal saving
rate averaged about 2-1/4 percent in October and November, little changed from
the third-quarter average but about 1-1/2 percentage points below the level of the
same period in 1998. Over this span, the ratio of net worth to income has
climbed substantially, likely reaching another historical high in the fourth
quarter of 1999.
Consumers greeted the new year with a surge of optimism. According to the
preliminary report, the Michigan SRC index of consumer sentiment soared to a
4. E-commerce again received a lot of attention in the press over the holiday season. The
Census Bureau is confident that it is correctly capturing purchases made over the Internet,
except perhaps for the normal lags that are involved in getting new firms into the retail sales
sample. As for any type of retailer, Census updates the survey each month with new outlets
based on recently issued employer identification numbers from the IRS. A firm typically gets its
ID number about three months before it could show up in the retail sales survey. Goods
purchased from firms that operate exclusively over the Internet are reported in the mail order
category of retail sales, which is part of "other nondurable goods." Because of the small sample
in the advance estimate, the Census does not publish a separate figure for mail order stores until
the preliminary estimate of retail sales. Purchases over the Internet from traditional "brick and
mortar" establishments will be reflected in the categories in which these establishments fall.

record level in early January, largely reflecting greater optimism about future
finances and business conditions and despite widespread expectations of higher
interest rates over the coming year: According to the SRC, 74 percent of
respondents expect interest rates to rise over the next twelve months. The
Conference Board's index of consumer confidence also climbed to a historic
high in January, spurred by more bullish assessments of current and future
business activity and more favorable views of employment conditions.
Housing Markets
Housing activity showed substantial resilience at year-end. With other economic
fundamentals remaining positive, rising mortgage rates have left little imprint on
the demand for single-family homes: Sales appear to have softened only a bit,
on balance, since last spring, and prices have continued to use.
Single-family starts rebounded in December, to 1.40 million units (annual rate).
Activity may have been boosted some by favorable weather conditions;
furthermore, adjusted permits for single-family units rose less than starts in
December, and the ratio of starts to permits was abnormally high, suggesting that
the starts estimate may be overstating somewhat the underlying strength of
construction activity. Even with those caveats, the average rate of single-family
construction during the fourth quarter was impressive in moving above the
already strong pace of the first three quarters of the year.
Sales of new homes fell 7 percent in November, offsetting most of a 9 percent
rise in October. At an average annual rate of 900,000 units, sales in the two
months equaled the third-quarter pace and were just 2 percent below the average
for the first half of the year. Sales of existing homes, which had stayed close to
5-1/4 million units (annual rate) during the first three quarters of the year,
dropped back to 5 million units (annual rate) in the fourth quarter.
More timely indicators are mixed but on balance indicate that housing demand
has been well maintained. The Michigan Survey's measure of household
perceptions of homebuying conditions edged down in early January and is off
sharply over the past year, owing mainly to a drop in the share of respondents
who thought that mortgage rates were relatively low. However, they do not
seem to have let that deter them greatly from entering the market. Many
homebuyers have muted the effect of the rise in mortgage rates on their monthly
payments--at least initially--by opting for adjustable rate loans; the rates on
ARMs have risen considerably less than those on FRMS, and the share of ARMs
in loan originations increased from 12 percent in the first quarter of 1999 to
about 30 percent in the second half. Builders' ratings of new home sales, though
down somewhat from the pace of last summer, have held at a high level. The

Mortgage Bankers' Association index of purchase applications for home
mortgages has remained at a high level despite decreases in the past two weeks.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts rose 3-3/4 percent in December to an
annual rate of 310,000 units; starts averaged 304,000 units (annual rate) in the
fourth quarter, almost 12 percent below the pace in the first three quarters of
1999. The ratio of starts to permits was below normal at year-end, a sign that
starts may pick up in coming months.
Home prices have registered some dramatic increases of late. For example, the
twelve-month change in the median price of a new home was 11 percent in
November, the largest increase in more than six years. This series is quite erratic
because it does not control for variations in house size or the geographic
composition of sales and because it is based on a very small sample.
Nevertheless, statistically more reliable data that control for many changes in
amenities and for geographic shifts also point to an acceleration in real new
home prices over the past three years. In particular, the year-over-year increase
in the constant-quality price of new homes, deflated by the CPI excluding
shelter, averaged 3.6 percent over the first three quarters of 1999 (latest data),
the most rapid three-quarter rise since early 1987. Similarly, despite some small
declines in recent quarters, the rate of increase in the real repeat-sales price of
existing homes in the third quarter was one of the highest since late 1987.
One factor in the acceleration of new home prices is higher construction costs.
The rate of increase in the employment cost index for construction trended
higher, on balance, in 1997 and 1998, and the rise in the cost of construction
materials, as measured by the producer price index, picked up substantially
beginning in the second half of 1998. Furthermore, the cost of lots rose sharply
in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, however, increases in the costs of construction
materials and labor appear to have flattened out; data for land costs are not yet
in, but builders' complaints about the scarcity of lots suggest that prices rose
further.
On the demand side of the ledger, house prices have been bid up dramatically in
some of the locales with heavy concentrations of individuals who have recently
reaped large wealth gains from the technology and financial sectors. But, more
broadly, wealth effects seem to be showing up in the Census Bureau's figures
that reveal large increases in the average size of houses completed for sale in
1998 and the first half of 1999. We suspect that other amenities are also being
built into new homes with growing frequency; to the extent that the quality

adjustment calculations do not fully capture these factors, the published index

Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Available information suggests that real business
outlays on high-tech equipment--computers and communications equipment--
rose at a slow pace in the fourth quarter relative to recent trends. However, with
spending on equipment outside of the high-tech and transportation categories
moving ahead, total real equipment and software expenditures still appear to
have increased at an annual rate of about 5-1/2 percent last quarter, well below
the average pace earlier in 1999. Y2K concerns held down expenditures on
high-tech equipment in the fourth quarter, as some firms were reluctant to
undertake major upgrades until their systems successfully cleared the century
date change. Nonetheless, underlying demand for computers and
communications equipment still seems to be very strong, and we expect that
spending on high-tech equipment will re-accelerate during the first half of this
year.
We estimate that real outlays for computers increased at an annual rate of about
20 percent last quarter. This relatively sluggish gain in spending appears to
reflect not only a pause in demand but also some supply constraints. As noted
above, some manufacturers, notably Dell and Gateway, reported difficulty in
meeting demand because of a chip shortage that developed when Intel held back
production in anticipation of a deeper slump in PC demand than apparently
occurred. These supply shortages also appear to have slowed the decline in
computer prices--and to have restrained the increase in real expenditures.6
Real outlays for communications equipment--which expanded at an average
annual rate of 34 percent over the first three quarters of 1999--appear to have
been up only a little in the fourth quarter. In addition to "system freezing" in
advance of Y2K, industry contacts report that the proposed mergers of GTE with
Bell Atlantic and of SBC with Ameritech led to a postponement of some capital
expenditures until the merging companies complete their plans to integrate and
rationalize their systems. Supply difficulties, such as shortages of components
5. The constant-quality price of new homes uses hedonic regression to adjust the sales price
(including the cost of the improved lot and direct and indirect selling costs) to hold constant
several important characteristics that affect prices, such as geographic location, floor area, some
other structural features, and types of materials. The more frequent inclusion in new homes of
amenities that are not in the hedonic regression models and are not highly correlated with the
included characteristics would boost the rate of price increase.
6. The PPI for computing equipment fell at an annual rate of 14.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, the slowest pace of price decline in four years.

and suitably trained technicians, have also slowed shipments of Lucent's newest
80-channel fiber optic system. Nonetheless, new orders for communications
equipment surged in December, and a rising backlog of unfilled orders points to
renewed growth in spending in this area in the coming months.
In the transportation sector, domestic outlays for aircraft appear to have been
about flat. Business demand for new vehicles has eased a bit. In December,
fleet sales are estimated to have jumped 9 percent (about 300,000 units),
although for the quarter as a whole, deliveries to fleets were down slightly from
the third-quarter high.7 Sales of medium and heavy trucks slipped back in
December from their exceptionally strong November pace; but, for the quarter,
sales were at an annual rate of 677,000 units--a blistering high for the year.
Looking ahead, net new orders for heavy trucks plummeted in December to the
lowest level since April 1996, and backlogs, which peaked in late 1998, fell
sharply further. Our contacts at the truck makers sense that demand has begun
to soften; one contact attributed some of the drop to the reluctance of trucking
companies to order new vehicles because of shortages of drivers.
Real expenditures for equipment outside of the high-tech and transportation
categories--which were about unchanged over the first three quarters of
1999--likely registered a sizable gain in the fourth quarter. A good deal of this
equipment appears to have been purchased from abroad: While both the orders
and shipments of U.S. manufacturers of such items rose modestly in the fourth
quarter, the merchandise trade data show that imports of this type of equipment
picked up noticeably.8 The stronger growth of manufacturing activity points to
continuing increases in this area in the coming months.
Nonresidential structures. Spending on private nonresidential construction
edged down, on balance, in October and November, continuing the fairly steady
decline that began last March. Despite a 3-1/4 percent increase in November,
nominal outlays for buildings averaged 1/2 percent lower in those two months
than in the third quarter. Contracts for nonresidential construction fell
10-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter after an equally steep drop in the third
quarter. Underlying these overall trends may be a shift in the mix of
nonresidential construction.
Spending for construction of office buildings leveled off, on average, in October
and November. Finance has become more costly, and investors appear to have
become more cautious, evidently perceiving that the supply of space coming on

In contrast, construction spending for other commercial structures (which
include retail space and warehouses) rose 9-1/4 percent in November, to the
highest level since last June. Average outlays for October and November were
only a bit below the third-quarter pace, though down 2 percent from the year-
earlier mark. Although the positive trends in retailing--including
e-commerce--and in manufacturing would suggest that demand for these
facilities would be well maintained, contracts decreased 10 percent in the fourth
quarter and are down nearly 12 percent from the year-earlier period.
Industrial building--which now accounts for less than 15 percent of nominal
spending on nonresidential buildings--showed a few glimmers of an upturn
toward year-end. Outlays rebounded in November, exactly offsetting the
October decline, although they remained, on average, 18-1/2 percent below their
year-earlier level. Contract awards for industrial projects rose 12-1/2 percent in
the fourth quarter; but given the sharp declines earlier in the year, the average
level of contracts still was 30 percent below the level in the final quarter of
1998.
Business Inventories
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories (excluding motor
vehicles) increased at an annual rate of $70.6 billion, on average, in October and
November--almost 50 percent greater than the pace of the third quarter. Despite
this rapid rate of stockbuilding, inventory-sales ratios generally edged down over
this period because of the very strong increases in shipments and sales.
Nonetheless, the October and November data on inventories and sales provided
some evidence of Y2K-related precautions. A $21 billion (annual rate) increase
in inventories of materials and supplies accounted for most of November's
accumulation in the manufacturing sector, a rise consistent with earlier reports
from purchasing managers that they would undertake some stockbuilding as
insurance against Y2K supply disruptions. Following a sharp October rise in
inventories held by pharmaceutical distributors, wholesale drug sales were very
strong in November; those sales may have contributed to a large increase in
November ($12 billion) in retail stocks in the "miscellaneous" nondurable
category, which includes drug stores. The inventory-sales ratio at retail food
stores moved up a bit, on balance, last fall, even though sales were fairly strong.
And inventories held at general merchandise stores also registered a large gain of
$14 billion in November.

While these figures for various categories provide limited evidence of
intentional Y2K-related stockpiling that could later be reversed, the inventory
data in the aggregate suggest that the sizable increases in stocks have been
motivated by strong sales. In the manufacturing sector, the inventory-shipments
ratio slipped to 1.29 months in November despite the extensive stockpiling of
materials and supplies. This ratio is in the middle of the narrow, flat range
recorded over the past six months. In the wholesale sector, stocks rose markedly
in November at suppliers of electrical goods ($9 billion) and professional and
commercial equipment ($5 billion) as well in the miscellaneous durables
category ($7 billion), which includes jewelry, toys, CDs, and sporting goods; in
each of these cases, the change in inventories largely tracked the change in sales,
leaving inventory-sales ratios about unchanged. In the retail sector, sales of
durable goods excluding motor vehicles were very strong in October and
November, and the stock-sales ratio dropped from the 2.10 months level
recorded between July and September to 2.05 months in November. Thus, on
balance, inventories appear to have ended November in lean shape.
Government Expenditures
Federal government sector. Recent data show continuing growth of the federal
budget surplus. Adjusted for payment timing shifts, December's surplus was
about $11 billion higher than the level recorded last year. Tax receipts surged
last month, but were offset to a great extent by a large increase in outlays.
Receipts in December were about 13 percent higher than the level recorded last
year. In particular, individual income and payroll taxes rose sharply--up almost
15 percent above last year's level--while corporate tax payments increased
moderately. Incoming data for January show that individual income and payroll
tax receipts continue to surge, with strength in both withheld and non-withheld
tax payments.
Outlays also increased significantly in December, up about 18 percent over last
year's level. Defense spending, in particular, was quite robust, fueled by
unusually large vendor payments. The rise in Medicare spending remained
quite subdued, but Medicaid spending was up 22 percent over last year; indeed,
Medicaid spending so far this fiscal year is about 10 percent higher than last
year. Spending in the "other" category also increased significantly in December,
largely as a result of higher agricultural support payments and a change in the
timing of international assistance.
CBO has speculated that the December surge in outlays owed, in part, to an
acceleration in spending by government agencies trying to avoid potential Y2K
problems by processing payments early. If this was the case, then outlays should

payments this month appear significantly weaker than in December. We believe
that not all of this timing pattern will show through to the NIPAs because the
NIPAs reflect deliveries rather than payments.
State and local government sector. The available indicators suggest that state
and local spending was quite strong in the fourth quarter. Employment rose
58,000 in December, boosted by a jump in hiring at primary and secondary
schools. The average monthly gain in jobs for the quarter came in above the
large increases recorded for both 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999.
Meanwhile, real construction spending surged to a record high level in
November, apparently largely because of unusually warm and dry weather
throughout much of the country. As a result, the October-November average
stood 2.8 percent above its third-quarter level.
Recent reports from the National Conference of State Legislatures confirm that
states are enjoying another year of very favorable fiscal conditions. Fiscal 1999
marked the seventh straight year of high or rising general fund balances.
Unexpectedly robust growth in revenues again accounted for the good news. As
a result, states enacted another $6 billion in tax cuts, on net, during their 1999
legislative sessions, the fifth straight year of cuts. In addition, a survey for fiscal
year 2000, which ends on June 30 for all but four states, indicates that most
states are continuing to enjoy good fiscal conditions. Twenty states reported
that, as of this past December, they expected that their revenues would come in
above previously anticipated levels, mostly because personal income and sales
tax collections will be higher than were projected at the start of the year.
Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia expect collections to be on
target. Only Louisiana is anticipating lower revenues for fiscal 2000. Moreover,
at least twelve states appear likely to enact yet another round of tax cuts during
upcoming legislative sessions.
Prices and Labor Costs
Overall consumer price inflation remained moderate as 1999 came to a close.
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in December after a 0.1 percent
increase in November. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices edged up
0.1 percent last month after having risen 0.2 percent in each of the two preceding
months.9 Over last year as a whole, the consumer price index rose 2.7 percent,
about 1 percentage point faster than the 1.6 percent increase posted in 1998.
Energy prices more than accounted for this acceleration in the overall CPI;
9. Although the past three months saw only modest increases in the core CPI, September's
0.3 percent jump helped push fourth-quarter core inflation to 2.5 percent (at an annual rate) on a
quarterly average basis.

excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 1.9 percent over 1999, compared with a
2.4 percent increase over 1998. (About 0.2 percentage point of the deceleration
in the published core CPI last year reflected technical changes: On a current-
methods basis, the core CPI rose 2.2 percent in 1998.)
The biggest inflation development--both last month and over the past year--was
in the energy sector. After having remained essentially flat in October and
November, the CPI for energy rose 1.4 percent in December, reflecting sharp
increases in gasoline and heating oil prices. The December increase in gasoline
prices owed to both higher costs of crude oil and higher margins at refiners;
however, available survey data (which cover most of January) suggest that retail
gasoline price inflation has moderated somewhat this month. Over 1999 as a
whole, higher world oil prices helped push consumer energy prices up more than
13 percent; this run-up largely reversed the decline in energy prices that began in
1997.
Food prices, by contrast, finished the year in line with the core index, increasing
0.1 percent in December and 1.9 percent over 1999 as a whole. Food prices in
December rose slightly, as lower dairy and meat prices largely offset higher
prices for other foodstuffs.
Prices for core CPI goods continued to be soft late last year, edging down
0.1 percent in December after having fallen 0.2 percent in November. Tobacco
prices rose 0.4 percent last month--the first increase in prices since September's
cigarette price hike. Apparel prices were unchanged after declining 0.5 percent
in the preceding month. New car and truck prices posted a 0.1 percent decline,
and used vehicle prices fell 0.7 percent. Prices for both categories of vehicles
decelerated in 1999, with new vehicles down 0.3 percent last year and used
vehicles up only 1.2 percent. December also saw a 0.4 percent increase in
computer prices; this was the first rise since the CPI began measuring computer
prices two years ago. The increase reflected a rare upward movement in the
component of computer prices that is derived from hedonic quality adjustments
as well as continued cost pressures associated with shortages of memory chips.10
For 1999 as a whole, core commodity prices rose just 0.2 percent, compared
with a 1.3 percent increase in 1998; the deceleration in core goods prices was
largely the result of a sharp reduction in tobacco price inflation, from 32 percent
in 1998 to 11 percent in 1999.
10. According to a BLS analyst, computer manufacturers have been responding to higher
memory prices by reducing the amount of memory in the systems they produce. This, together
with other changes in the configuration of typical systems (such as the inclusion of lower-quality
monitors and smaller hard drives), reduced the measured quality of computers in December and
boosted their price in the CPI on a quality-adjusted basis.

rose 0.4 percent for a second consecutive month. Over the past year, owners'
equivalent rent rose 2.4 percent, compared with 3.2 percent in 1998; this
slowing, and a 0.3 percentage point deceleration in tenants'rent, were largely
responsible for an overall decline in core services price inflation from
3.0 percent in 1998 to 2.7 percent in 1999. Excluding shelter, prices of core
services rose 0.2 percent in December after a 0.4 percent gain in the preceding
month; these prices were up 2.9 percent over 1999 as a whole, compared with a
2.6 percent increase over 1998.
The PPI for capital equipment rose 0.1 percent in December after having edged
down in the preceding month. Capital equipment prices rose only 0.3 percent
over 1999 as a whole, as modest price increases for most categories of
equipment were offset by price declines for computer, communications, and
medical equipment. However, like the CPI, the PPI for computer prices has not
been declining in recent months as rapidly as it did earlier in the year: Over the
fourth quarter, the PPI for computers dropped at an annual rate of about
13 percent, compared with an average decline of almost 22 percent over the first
three quarters of last year.
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for intermediate materials excluding food
and energy rose 0.2 percent in December, the tenth consecutive month in which
core intermediate prices rose. For 1999 as a whole, core intermediate goods
prices posted a 1.9 percent increase, roughly retracing their 1998 decline. Prices
of crude goods excluding food and energy rose 1.8 percent in December; after
having dropped 16 percent in 1998, the PPI for core crude goods began rising
last May and increased about 14 percent over the course of the year. Spot prices
of many industrial commodities have risen since the PPI's price quotes were
collected in mid-December, while futures prices ticked upward in mid-January
after having fluctuated within a relatively flat range for several months. The
recent uptick in futures prices was driven, in part, by higher prices for
agricultural crops, stocks of which finished lower at the end of autumn than
traders had anticipated. However, with the exception of metals, broad indexes
of commodity prices do not appear to be rising as rapidly as they did over the
first half of 1999.
The median response to the preliminary University of Michigan survey of one-
year-ahead inflation expectations was 2.9 percent in January, the same as its
average level over the fourth quarter of 1999. Near-term inflation expectations
from this survey rose about 1/2 percentage point over 1999, presumably

reflecting the actual increase in inflation that occurred over the course of the
year. Longer-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have been
more stable, although the median response in January edged up 0.1 percentage
point from the preceding month, to 3 percent.
At present, our only hard data on fourth-quarter labor costs come from the
monthly report on average hourly earnings. Average hourly earnings rose
0.4 percent in December after a 0.1 percent increase in November; over the
fourth quarter of 1999, they rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, in line with the
third-quarter increase. For 1999 as a whole, the increase was 3.7 percent, about
the same as in 1998.
Expressed as a twelve-month change, average hourly earnings inflation is
currently running 1/2 to 3/4 percentage point below its peak in early 1998.
Although this deceleration may appear somewhat surprising given the extremely
tight labor market, much of it--although not all--can be explained by the
influence of lagged price inflation on wages. Econometric evidence suggests
that 1997's sharp deceleration in the CPI helped put downward pressure on
average hourly earnings in 1998 and over the first half of 1999.11 However,
these models now estimate that the effect of lower price inflation on wage
change has largely run its course.
Survey data released this month provide a modicum of evidence on prospective
employer health insurance costs in 2000. Respondents to a survey of large
employers conducted by the Towers-Perrin consulting firm indicated that the
rate of increase of health insurance costs will pick up, from 7 percent in 1999 to
10 percent in 2000. The survey also indicated that employers are not expecting
to pass on a disproportionate share of the increases in health care costs to
employees. Although the measure of health benefit costs collected by the
Towers-Perrin survey differs significantly (in terms of concept and coverage)
from the employer cost index for health insurance, the two measures are
reasonably well correlated.12 Moreover, some mixed evidence of higher health
care inflation can be found in the CPI. After having increased sharply in 1998,
prescription drug inflation rose by more than a percentage point in 1999, to
6.1 percent. Prices of medical services rose slightly faster--3.6 percent--in 1999
than in 1998, which suggests that the rise in medical services inflation that
occurred in 1998 has turned out to be persistent. The impact on the CPI of this
11. Within the context of an econometric model of average hourly earnings, lagged inflation
serves to largely offset the effect of labor market tightness. However, a large fraction of the
recent observed deceleration in average hourly earnings is left unexplained by the model.
12. Towers-Perrin surveys only large firms, while the ECI attempts to cover the universe of
employers. In addition, the ECI measures only the employer cost of providing health benefits,
while the Towers-Perrin figures include both employer and employee costs.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
The announcement that the FOMC would maintain a neutral bias over the
century date change was widely expected and elicited little market reaction. At
year-end, it became apparent to market participants that financial markets would
successfully negotiate the change, and attention returned to evidence of
continuing strong economic expansion. Given the Federal Reserve's announced
concern regarding unsustainable growth, the incoming information led to an
elevation of earlier expectations regarding the dimension of likely monetary
policy firming. Market participants found only temporary relief in Chairman
Greenspan's mid-January speech on technology and in subsequent, relatively
benign inflation reports.
All told, under these pressures, yields on intermediate- and long-term Treasuries
have risen 16 to 33 basis points over the intermeeting period. Corporate bond
yields also have risen, but by less than Treasuries, narrowing spreads by 15 basis
points on investment-grade bonds and by 10 basis points on speculative-grade
bonds. Readings on federal funds futures rates suggest that the market is
virtually certain of at least a 25-basis-point tightening next week and that a few
participants now see a 50-basis-point move as possible. Eurodollar futures have
priced in as much as a full percentage increase in the targeted funds rate by early
2001.
The rise in market interest rates and accompanying volatility over the
intermeeting period helped put a dent in the enthusiasm for equities, most
notably for blue chips. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are
off about 1 percent, and the Wilshire 5000 is up only a little over 1 percent,
despite generally favorable earnings reports. However, the Nasdaq has climbed
close to 8 percent, led once again by price gains in technology shares.
Overall, growth in the total debt of the nonfinancial sectors in the fourth quarter
appears to have remained close to the 6-3/4 percent pace of the first three
quarters of last year. Net business borrowing remained brisk in the quarter as a
whole, but did fall off toward year-end; it has picked up again, though somewhat
sluggishly, in the new year. In the household sector, growth of mortgage debt
appears to have sustained its strong pace in recent months; consumer credit
expanded sharply in October and November, and bank data for December point
to another substantial gain. Municipal bond issuance was slow at the end of
1999 and has remained light in January, but indicators point to a pickup in
coming weeks. The Treasury stepped up its issuance of securities in the fourth
quarter to boost its year-end cash balance, but so far in 2000, it has been paying
down debt in volume.

The growth of the broad monetary aggregates picked up in December, mainly
reflecting precautionary liquidity building prior to year-end by households and
businesses. Those positions began to unwind around the turn of the year. For
the year as a whole, M2 rose 6-1/4 percent, 1-1/4 percentage points above the
top of its monitoring range, and M3 expanded 7-3/4 percent, 1-3/4 percentage
points above the top of its range. Overall, the growth of bank credit remained
strong in December partly owing to borrowers tapping banks for funds before
year-end; data in the first weeks of the new year suggest a softening.
Effect of Y2K Rollover on Financial Markets
Conditions in most financial markets over the intermeeting period followed a
pattern similar to that of other year-ends. Prior to the turn, activity in most
markets was subdued. Federal funds traded in a range that was fairly typical for
year-end, although the effective funds rate on a few days before year-end fell
below the target rate. In the Treasury market, trading volumes declined and bid-
asked spreads widened a bit, but they were not out of line with previous years.
As noted, the pace of business borrowing generally dropped off, with bond
issuance falling appreciably, but not much more than in previous years.
Business borrowing at banks, which had been brisk over November and early
December, tapered off as well.
After the New Year holiday, activity in financial markets quickly perked up, and
the unwinding of positions taken in advance of the turn proceeded in an orderly
fashion. Reflows of currency to the System have been rapid, reversing two-
thirds of the estimated $84 billion buildup of currency at banks and in the hands
of the public. Similarly, after the smooth transition to Y2K, investors began to
pare the large balances they had accumulated in large-denomination time
deposits and in institution-only money funds.
Business Finance
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations slowed significantly in
December from November's rapid pace. Indeed, offerings in the latter half of
December were almost nil as the primary market shut down in advance of the
holidays and the century date change. So far in January, issuance has resumed,
but has remained light, especially by lower-rated credits. While some
investment-grade firms reportedly have come to market in anticipation that rates
may rise further, a number of others have pulled back offerings as bond rates
firmed.
Short- and intermediate-term business credit continued to expand rapidly in the
fourth quarter. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding increased
substantially in December, as firms built up precautionary liquid reserves prior
to year-end. In January to date, commercial paper has continued to expand, but

at a more subdued pace. After rising strongly in November, business loans at
banks contracted somewhat over December, and weekly data for January
indicate a flattening. The January Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated some
further tightening over the past three months in terms and standards for C&I
loans at commercial banks. The survey respondents cited a reduced tolerance
for risk, a less favorable economic outlook, and industry-specific problems as
the main reasons.
On balance, business credit quality deteriorated in 1999 but remained high by
historical standards. The ratio of liabilities of failed nonfinancial businesses to
total liabilities for the sector moved up in 1999 from 1998 but was below the
rate in 1997 and those recorded in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Moody's
rating changes in the past two months have led to a modest net downgrade of
corporate debt, particularly for speculative-grade firms. However, the amount
of debt on watch is evenly split between upgrades and downgrades. The
deterioration last year was concentrated among firms that issue junk bonds. The
junk bond default rate for U.S. companies jumped to 4.7 percent in 1999--the
highest annual pace since the peak of almost 9 percent in 1991.
Equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations fell off in December from
November's record pace; activity in late December is usually lackluster, and
there were no multi-billion-dollar offerings as had been the case in November.
Firms have raised only about $6 billion to date in January, but more than 150
initial public offerings have been registered for the next few months.
Merger and acquisition activity continues to sizzle. In the fourth quarter,
mergers financed with cash payments--rather than with stock--led to equity
retirements of about $29 billion, bringing merger-related equity retirements for
the year to $115 billion, second only to 1998's record pace. In December and
January, many new deals were announced, including the record AOL-Time
Warner merger in early January; the list of pending M&A transactions now tops
a trillion dollars. Although most deals will be financed with stock, the volume
of cash transactions also is expected to remain high. Announcements of share
repurchases picked up in the fourth quarter from a weak third-quarter level, but
they remain below the record pace of 1998.
More than half of the S&P 500 firms have reported fourth-quarter earnings, and
these reports suggest that the four-quarter growth for S&P 500 earnings per
share was robust, exceeding 20 percent. Earnings growth was boosted, in part,
by strong recoveries in the oil and basic materials sectors and by exceptionally
high revenues earned by investment banks from underwriting and trading
activity. Earnings of small- and mid-sized companies are expected to show
respectable gains, too, though their growth continues to lag those of large firms.

Since November, strategists' projections for S&P 500 earnings growth in 2000
have increased more than 3 percentage points to nearly 11 percent.
Technology sector stock gains propelled the Nasdaq index to a new high;
despite some fallback in recent days, the index is up almost 8 percent since the
December FOMC meeting. In addition, the Russell 2000 index of small- to
mid-cap firms is up about 12 percent, reflecting in large part the gains of biotech
firms. Rising interest rates have essentially eliminated any difference between
the S&P forward earnings-price ratio and the real thirty-year Treasury bond rate.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Primary commercial mortgage interest rates increased 20 basis points in
December and now are up almost 160 basis points since last January. Yields on
AAA-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities have risen by a like amount.
The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated that, on net, banks have continued to
tighten credit standards on commercial mortgage loans. Conduits originating
loans for CMBS also appear to be tightening credit standards, with Moody's
recently reporting that average loan-to-value ratios for loans backing newly
issued CMBS reached a two-year low in the fourth quarter.
Higher rates and the somewhat tighter credit standards do not appear to have
damped loan demand much. The Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated that
demand for commercial mortgage loans remains strong, with 11 percent of
banks, on net, reporting increased demand. In addition, loans in the pipeline
will push up CMBS issuance in the near-term. Issuance in the first quarter, as
indicated by the current calender of deals, is expected to total between
$16 billion and $20 billion, the strongest pace in more than a year. Loans
backing new CMBS issues are likely to continue the trend toward floating
interest rates. In the fourth quarter of 1999, nearly 40 percent of CMBS issuance
was floating rate compared with an average of 5 percent over the first three
quarters.1 Spreads on fixed-rate, investment-grade CMBS have narrowed 13 to
15 basis points since the December FOMC meeting, mainly because of lower
swap spreads and the prospect of a reduced supply of fixed-rate CMBS issuance.
REIT stock prices have moved up 9 percent since their trough in mid-December.
However, they are still more than 32 percent below the peak reached in October
1997, and REIT property acquisition and development activity is likely to
remain subdued.
1. Fixed-rate mortgages are usually thirty-year amortization, ten-year bullet mortgages with
a fixed lock-out period on refinancing and substantial prepayment penalties after the lock-out
period. Floating-rate mortgages tend to be short-term-usually three years.

Household Finance
Household debt rose briskly in the fourth quarter despite higher mortgage and
consumer loan rates. Consumer credit growth jumped to a 13-3/4 percent
annual rate in November, pulling the average growth rate in the first two months
of the quarter to slightly over 9 percent-well above the third-quarter pace.
Consumer loans originated by banks expanded rapidly in December, as well.
Also, home mortgage debt growth in the fourth quarter is estimated to have been
close to the brisk third-quarter rate of about 10 percent. The continued high
level of the MBA purchase index suggests that mortgage debt growth likely
remained strong into the new year. This indicator is a bit at odds with results
from the Senior Loan Officer Survey, which showed some decrease in demand
for home mortgage loans. On net, 64 percent of respondents reported weaker
demand for home mortgages--the largest net percentage since the first quarter of
1995. However, on net, banks have been reporting a weakening in demand for
home mortgage loans for the past three quarters, but the slowing has yet to
materialize in the data for mortgage debt growth.
Interest rates have risen on most types of households loans. Relative to a year
ago, rates on fixed-rate mortgages have increased about 148 basis points, and
rates on one-year adjustable mortgages have risen about 100 basis points. Rates
charged by commercial banks on home equity lines of credit, personal loans, and
auto loans have risen between 42 and 73 basis points from the troughs reached
earlier last year. In addition, captive auto finance companies reduced credit
incentives, contributing to a substantial rise in rates on their loans. The
combination of rapid debt growth and higher interest rates has lifted the
household debt-service burden still higher, but it remains below the peak levels
reached in the mid-1980s.
Households' demand for equity mutual fund shares has continued to be strong.
Weekly data show that inflows to equity mutual funds so far in January have
been extremely robust. Domestic funds have continued to draw the bulk of
inflows, but flows into international equity funds have increased considerably,
likely reflecting the recent relatively high rates of return experienced abroad.
Bond and hybrid funds continued to show outflows in January, as rising interest
rates generated capital losses, while inflows to retail money market funds have
continued to be strong.
Government Securities Markets
Treasury. At year-end, the Treasury's cash balance was $83 billion,
significantly higher than the $70 billion targeted level and well in excess of the
typical year-end cash balance of about $30 billion. The excess in the cash
balance at this past year-end included $23 billion earmarked to support the
Federal Financing Bank's line of credit to credit unions. As a contingency

measure, the NCUA drew down $1 billion of this special financing at year-end,
but faced demands of only $140 million from individual credit unions. Since
the turn of the year, the Treasury has scaled back its weekly bill auctions to a bit
below typical levels, and cash management bills issued in the fourth quarter
matured without replacement in mid-January.
In January, the Treasury provided details of its debt buyback plan, much of
which had been anticipated. The program will purchase off-the-run Treasury
securities to help maintain the size and liquidity of on-the-run issues. The
Treasury plans to initiate the program within the next few months, concentrating
its purchases at the long end of the maturity spectrum to hold down the average
maturity of the outstanding debt; it will retire as much as $30 billion of
outstanding debt this year, somewhat more than market participants had
expected. Also contrary to expectations, the Treasury announced that any
premium over par paid on repurchased securities would not be treated as a
budget outlay, removing an obstacle that many market participants believed
would limit the Treasury's willingness to repurchase securities trading at a high
premium.2 After the announcement, spreads between yields on off-the-run and
on-the-run bonds narrowed a bit, with rates on bonds that had been trading at
substantial premiums declining the most.
Also in January, the Treasury auctioned $6 billion of ten-year, inflation-indexed
securities. Demand for these securities was strong, leading to a better-than-
expected price and a three-to-one bid to cover ratio. However, the yield on these
securities, at 4.34 percent, was 60 basis points higher than a year ago and
100 basis points above the yield on the first offering in 1997.
Federal agency. Spreads between yields on benchmark five- and ten-year
agency securities and those on comparable Treasuries narrowed about 8 basis
points over the intermeeting period and now range between 43 and 55 basis
points. Issuance of Fannie Mae Benchmark and Freddie Mac Reference notes
picked up in January and thus far totals $16 billion, up sharply from the
$300 million issued in December. The Federal Home Loan Bank System also
stepped up its issuance of "Taps" securities in January, garnering about
$3 billion so far, compared with just $200 million in December.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also jumped into the short-term market to
take advantage of the gap left by a reduction in the supply of Treasury bills. In
January, Fannie and Freddie auctioned nearly $60 billion of short-term
2. OMB made the decision not to treat the premiums as a budget outlay.

benchmark bills with maturities of six months or less.3 At that pace, market
observers predict that about half of Fannie Mae's and most of Freddie Mac's
short-term debt will consist of benchmark bills by the time the new benchmark
programs are fully phased in.
The agency benchmark bills share many characteristics of Treasury bills. They
are issued weekly or monthly, with the three-, six-, and twelve-month
benchmark bills auctioned early in the week and settled on Thursdays to
coincide with the Treasury's schedule. Another similarity is that Fannie Mae's
six-month bills will be reopened as three-month bills, and Freddie Mac's
twelve-month bill will be reopened as six-month and then again as three-month
bills.
State and local. A lull in activity in late December left gross offerings of
long-term municipal bonds at $15 billion last month, down a bit from the
average for the previous months of 1999. So far in January, offerings have
remained light, but a notable increase in the forward calendar suggests that
municipal debt issuance is poised to rebound.
In December, weak demand kept yields on municipal bonds at high levels.
Concerns about the possibility of rising inflation and Fed actions, as well as the
booming stock market, prompted net outflows from tax-exempt mutual funds.
However, the increases in muni yields lagged the rise in Treasury yields, and the
ratio of the thirty-year revenue bond yield to the thirty-year Treasury yield fell
back in December. These trends have continued in January, bringing the ratio
down to levels last seen in the first half of 1998.
Credit quality of municipal issuers remained strong over the intermeeting
period. Standard and Poor's upgrades exceeded downgrades, both in number of
issues and dollar volume. Not-for-profit health care providers continue to
account for the bulk of downgrades. Although recent legislation to expand
Medicare funding will provide some relief to health care providers with
municipal debt, the additional money is to be paid out over five years, making
revenue increases for most firms too small to have an immediate effect on credit
quality.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth in the broad monetary aggregates picked up appreciably in December,
largely due to heightened demands for liquidity associated with Y2K
3. The term "benchmark bills" refers to both Fannie Mae's Benchmark bills and Freddie
Mac's Reference bills.

preparations.4 The public's demand for currency climbed, and growth in retail
money funds was strong. In contrast, liquid deposit growth remained anemic, as
depositors apparently reduced inflows to these accounts to help finance their
currency buildup. Preliminary data for January suggest that the growth of M2
has slowed, as the buildup in currency has started to unwind.
Y2K appears to have had a more sizable effect on M3, as the managed liabilities
included in this aggregate surged in December. A heightened desire by
banks--especially U.S. branches of foreign banks--to lock in over-the-turn
funding, as well as an increased desire on the part of investors for safe, liquid
assets, contributed to the massive fourth-quarter run-up in large time deposits.
Institution-only money funds also swelled at the end of last year as many
businesses apparently built up precautionary liquid balances. The RP and
eurodollar components of M3 posted strong increases as well. Preliminary data
for January show that each of these non-M2 components has declined, on
balance, since the turn of the year.
Bank credit grew rapidly in December, with strength in both securities and
loans. Real estate and consumer loans each expanded at more than a 20 percent
annual rate. However, about half of the growth in real estate bookings at banks
reflected the acquisition of a large thrift. The increase in consumer loans was
likely driven by strong retail spending as well as by a shift toward credit card
purchases, including those associated with Internet shopping. Business loan
growth slowed in December, in part due to a pickup in securitizations.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The January 2000 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused primarily on changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to
businesses and households over the past three months. Supplementary questions
addressed the reasons behind the recent rise in delinquency rates on C&I loans, the
unusually heavy lending to securities brokers and dealers over November and
December, and Year 2000 (Y2K) issues. Loan officers from fifty-five large domestic
banks and twenty-one U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks participated in the
survey. The responses indicate that banks became more cautious lenders over the past
three months but do not suggest a widespread reduction in credit availability.
The survey results point to a continued firming of business lending practices. Both
domestic banks and branches and agencies of foreign banks reported tightening terms
on C&I loans, in particular risk premiums. Compared with November, a higher net
percentage of both domestic and foreign respondents reported that they had boosted
underwriting standards on C&I loans as well. In addition, a notable fraction of
domestic banks raised standards for commercial real estate loans. On the demand side,
domestic banks noted that demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms
and demand for commercial real estate loans had increased over the past three months.
Well over half of the respondents agreed that the pattern of delinquency rates on their
own C&I loan portfolios is consistent with the upward trend in aggregate delinquency
rates that began in early 1998. Both domestic banks and branches and agencies of
foreign banks indicated that their problem loans are limited to specific industries, such
as health care. However, many banks also view the delinquency rates on C&I loans as
returning to a more normal long-run level.
Among domestic banks, there was some evidence of greater willingness to make
consumer installment loans. Nonetheless, a few banks tightened their standards on
credit card and other consumer loans. For the third consecutive quarter, a large fraction
of banks reported that demand for home mortgages weakened, and a fair number of
banks also reported a modest decrease in demand for consumer loans.
In the period leading up to year-end, a number of large banks stepped up their lending
to securities brokers and dealers through reverse RP agreements. Both domestic and
foreign participants in this market indicated that they increased their activity in
response to greater funding needs by dealers, some of whom encountered difficulties in
obtaining funding elsewhere. Consistent with the relatively tame aftermath of the
century date change, very few banks indicated that Y2K-related concerns had any
significant effect on their lending activities. The survey results suggest that Y2K-
related deposit inflows tended to exceed Y2K-related credit demands.
Lending to Businesses
Over the past three months, about 11 percent of domestic banks tightened standards on
C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, up from 9 percent, on net, in November.

III-A-2
No domestic or foreign banks reported that they had eased standards. For the second
consecutive survey, almost 29 percent of branches and agencies of foreign banks
reported tighter standards on C&I loans. In the case of lending to small firms, nearly
10 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had tightened standards, up from only
2 percent, on net, in November.
Regarding terms on business loans, both domestic and foreign respondents reported a
further tightening, though the tightening was slightly more pronounced at branches and
agencies of foreign banks. For domestic respondents, 35 percent, on net, reported
charging higher premiums on riskier loans to large and middle-market firms, and
25 percent, on net, charged higher spreads of loan rates over their bank's cost of funds.
For small firms, 22 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported charging higher spreads
on riskier loans, while other terms remained basically unchanged. On the foreign side,
43 percent of respondents reported charging higher risk premiums, and 29 percent
reported raising costs for credit lines. Both domestic and foreign banks reported a
reduced tolerance for risk as the most important reason for tightening standards and
terms, followed by a less-favorable or more-uncertain economic outlook and a
worsening of industry-specific problems.
On net, 9 percent of domestic banks reported stronger demand for business loans from
large and middle-market firms, while the demand from small firms was reported to be
about unchanged. In contrast, 19 percent of foreign banks indicated a moderate
weakening in the demand for C&I loans. Among domestic banks that reported stronger
demand, increased merger and acquisition financing was given as the primary reason,
followed by the need to finance accounts receivable and capital expenditures. Banks
that reported decreased demand for C&I loans cited reduced business fixed investment
as the most common reason.
A special question addressed reasons for the increase in delinquency rates on C&I
loans evident since early 1998. Among the banks surveyed, nearly 60 percent of
domestic respondents and 90 percent of foreign respondents reported that their
delinquency rates had in fact increased. Industry-specific problems, particularly in
health care, were cited as the most important factor, especially among large domestic
banks and foreign respondents. Although several foreign respondents pointed to a
general easing of lending standards between 1994 and 1998 as a cause of the recent rise
in delinquency rates on C&I loans, many banks viewed delinquencies as returning to a
more normal long-run level from the unusually low levels before 1998. Despite the
continued increase in average maturity of business loans evident in the Survey of
Terms of Business Lending, relatively few banks noted that a general seasoning of their
C&I loan portfolio has had an effect on the recent increase in delinquency rates.
For commercial real estate loans, 11 percent, on net, of domestic banks reported
somewhat tighter standards, while standards at foreign respondents were reported to be
unchanged. On the demand side, 11 percent, on net, of domestic banks reported
moderately stronger demand for commercial real estate loans, while 17 percent of
foreign respondents reported weaker demand.

III-A-3
Bank lending to securities brokers and dealers in the form of reverse RP transactions
was very strong during November and early December. Eight foreign respondents and
twelve domestic banks indicated that they had increased their activity in the RP market
over this period. Several respondents noted that demand for credit rose because of
heavy funding needs of securities brokers and dealers. In addition, banks stepped up
their lending in this market because broker-dealers' cost of commercial paper
extending over year-end rose markedly and because other institutional lenders pulled
back.
Lending to Households
The demand for home mortgage loans was reported to have deteriorated into January.
Compared with November, when 41 percent of senior loan officers, on net, reported
weaker demand, 64 percent reported weaker demand in the current survey-the highest
net percentage since the first quarter of 1995. On net, banks have been reporting
weaker demand for home mortgage loans for the past three quarters. On the demand
side, the results may be influenced by a sharp slowdown in refinancing activity, though
the question specifically refers to demand for mortgage loans to purchase a home.
Compared with three months ago, 4 percent, on net, of banks reported somewhat
greater willingness to make consumer installment loans. A small net fraction of banks
indicated that they had tightened credit standards for both credit card and other
consumer loans. Despite rapid growth in consumer credit in December, almost
10 percent of respondents, on net, reported decreased demand for consumer loans. It
appears likely that much of the consumer lending late last year represented heavy credit
card usage, which lending officers may not have factored into their responses.
Year 2000
Only three domestic banks reported that they extended more than a negligible amount
of credit to nonfinancial firms for Y2K-related needs. These loans were used mostly to
fund precautionary buildups of liquidity and inventories. Banks also mentioned
inventories and liquidity to explain strong C&I loan demand, and it was possible that
some of the strength in C&I lending was for Y2K-related reasons that were not evident
to respondents. Similarly, only four domestic banks extended at least a moderate
amount of Y2K-related credit to financial firms, particularly mutual funds, other
domestic banks, and insurance companies.
Most banks reported no unusual funding pressures around year-end. Sixty percent
reported that neither credit demands nor deposit flows were materially affected by
Y2K-related concerns. However, about one-quarter of domestic banks indicated that
higher credit demands were about matched by Y2K-related net deposit inflows, and
9 percent of domestic respondents and 14 percent of foreign branches and agencies
indicated that they had excess funds to invest, owing to stronger Y2K-related deposit
inflows than loan demands.

The value of exports rose nearly 3/4 percent in November, as increases in
consumer goods, industrial machinery, and semiconductors were offset only
partly by declines in other categories. For October-November combined, the
value of exports was 2 percent higher than in the third quarter. Most of the
increase was in industrial supplies (particularly fuels and chemicals) and service
receipts. Exports of capital goods, both aircraft and machinery, were about the
same as in the third quarter.
The value of imports rose 1 1/2 percent in November, following a similarly sized
increase in October, putting the value of imports for October-November
combined 3 percent above its third quarter level. There were solid increases in
most major trade categories, except automotive products, aircraft, and foods.
Quantity and price of imported oil. The value of imported oil increased
further in October and November, as higher prices outstripped reduced
quantities. For October-November combined, the quantity of imported oil
dropped nearly 0.4 million barrels per day from the third quarter level as
petroleum stocks were drawn down significantly to accommodate an increase in
domestic consumption. The average price of imported oil rose to over $21 per
barrel in October and November, up nearly $3 per barrel from the third quarter
average.

IV-5
In December, the monthly average spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
rose $1.25 to over $26 per barrel. The increase was largely driven by Iraq's
decision to halt exports for several weeks. More recently, oil prices have
increased further with speculation over a possible extension of current OPEC
production targets and with the onset of cold weather in key consuming regions.
Spot WTI is currently trading near $28 per barrel.
Prices of non-oil imports and exports. In December, prices of non-oil
imported goods were unchanged after increasing nearly 1/2 percent in November.
Prices of imported industrial supplies rose much less in December than in the
previous two months, and there were small declines in the prices of most other
import categories. One exception was imports of foods, feeds, and beverages,
where prices increased as a result of the rising cost of coffee. For the fourth
quarter, non-oil import prices rose nearly 2 percent at an annual rate, the first
increase in four years. Prices of imported computers and semiconductors
declined only slightly in the fourth quarter, whereas prices of core goods (which
excludes computers, semiconductors, and oil) moved up 2 1/2 percent at an
annual rate.
Prices of exported goods increased slightly in December as declines in the prices
of agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors were offset by increases
in the prices of industrial supplies. For the fourth quarter, prices of exported
goods rose nearly 2 1/2 percent at an annual rate, compared with a percent
annual increase in the third quarter. Prices of exported core goods (which
excludes computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products) increased 4 1/4
percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest increase since 1995.
The rise was led by increases in the prices of exported industrial supplies and, to
a lesser extent, by increases in the prices of exported automotive products and
consumer goods. Prices of exported agricultural products, computers, and
semiconductors declined moderately.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private-sector demand for U.S. securities remained strong in November
(line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table), as foreign
purchases of corporate and agency securities far outpaced net sales of Treasury
securities. After further large net purchases in November, year-to-date net
foreign purchases of agency bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate stocks are all
at record annual levels. November's net purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds
were fairly widespread, although as is customary, the largest portion was through
the United Kingdom and Caribbean financial centers (CFCs). Purchases of
agency bonds were strongest through Japan and Bermuda.

IV-6
The marked increase in foreign purchases of agency bonds in 1999 coincides
with the agencies' issuance of reference and benchmark debt, designed to fill the
void left by the reduced supply of Treasury securities. Despite strong demand
from Europe, November was the third straight month of net sales of Treasury
securities. Barring strong net purchases in December, 1999 will be the first year
since 1990 in which private-sector foreigners sold Treasuries on net.
U.S. residents were strong net sellers of foreign stocks in November (line 5), in
contrast to the recent trend (since July) of net purchases or modest net sales.
The geographical pattern is largely the same as it has been all year, with net
purchases of stocks through Japan and net sales through Europe. However, in
November there were also strong net sales of stocks through the CFCs. U.S.
residents made small net purchases of foreign bonds in November, mostly
through Europe, while net sales of bonds were made through CFCs and, notably,
Argentina. For 1999 through November, taking into account the $100 billion in
foreign stocks U.S. investors acquired through stock swaps (included in line 9),
net U.S. purchases of foreign securities are at about the same level as the past
few years.
Foreign official assets held in the United States fell slightly in November after a
small increase in October (line 1). Modest declines were recorded for OPEC
countries, Hong Kong, and Mexico. Sizable increases were recorded for
Singapore and China. Foreign official assets have increased nearly $21 billion
for the year to date, after decreasing $17 billion in 1998. The increase in 1999 is
more than accounted for by Japan ($35 billion), as the result of its foreign
exchange intervention operations. Foreign official assets of OPEC countries
increased only slightly in 1999, despite a significant increase in oil revenues.
Reserves of "all other countries" (line 1c) fell for the second consecutive year,
despite significant increases in reserves for China, Korea, and Hong Kong.
Preliminary data from the FRBNY for December and the first half of January
suggest that foreign official assets held in the United States continued to
increase, due almost entirely to further Japanese accumulation.
Large inflows through banking offices in the United States were reported in
November (line 3). Partial data for December show outflows of equal
magnitude.

Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period since the December FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange value of
the dollar changed little on a weighted-average basis against the other major
currencies, as a 22 percent gain against the yen offset losses against the British
pound (2.0 percent), the Australian dollar (1.8 percent) and the Canadian dollar
(3.1 percent). A marked increase in commodity prices helped boost the
exchange rates of both the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar against the U.S.
dollar, with the price of industrial metals rising 4 percent and oil prices up 9
percent. The dollar appreciated 1.3 percent against the euro, as the single
currency broke decidedly below parity on January 27 to reach yet another new
low. On average, the dollar is about unchanged vis-à-vis the currencies of our
other important trading partners.

October November December January
A major concern throughout the world during the intermeeting period was
whether potential computer glitches associated with the century date change
would disrupt economic activity. Judging from the runup in equity prices in the
weeks before the December meeting up through the end of the year, most
investors seemed to be confident that disruptions would be minimal. Since the
December FOMC meeting, equity prices have extended the climb that began in
October, gaining about 4 percent in the euro area and Japan. Share prices in the
United Kingdom also rose in the closing days of 1999, but have since fallen and
are almost 7 percent lower, on net, for the intermeeting period. As was widely
expected in the market, on January 13 the Bank of England raised its repurchase
rate 25 basis points to 53 percent, continuing what the market has anticipated

IV-9
will be a cycle of tightening by the major central banks, with the Bank of Japan
expected to be the noted exception. On January 18, the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand raised the official cash rate 25 basis points to 5 1/4 percent.
With the turn of the century over, three-month rates no longer carry a risk
premium reflecting Y2K concerns and have declined slightly in Europe even as
market expectations solidified that the European Central Bank will tighten in the
first half of this year. Japanese three-month rates declined 7 basis points. These
rates were kept low around the turn of the year by mammoth injections of excess
liquidity by the Bank of Japan. By mid-January, though, the Bank of Japan's
provision of reserves settled back to more normal levels consistent with
maintaining the call money rate near zero.

In an effort to weaken the yen, the Bank of Japan conducted two intervention
operations, on December 24 and January 4. The short-run impact of the first
intervention was limited, but the second operation seemed to have a more lasting
effect. These interventions did serve to apprise the market of the extent of the
Japanese government's concern over the yen's strength. Later in the period, the
dollar/yen exchange rate appeared to be affected by various rumors about the
content of the G-7 communiqué. The yen did depreciate after the release of the
communiqué, with market analysts noting the mention of shared concern over
the currency's strength. More fundamentally, signs of a sustainable recovery in

IV-10
Japan remain difficult to find, with much of the growth coming from
government fiscal stimulus and exports, which stands in marked contrast to
vigorous expansion in the United States and a quickening recovery in Europe.
These prospects are also reflected in ten-year bellwether bond yields, which rose
more than 30 basis points m the euro zone, matching the rise in the United
States, while falling slightly in Japan. The yield spread between ten-year U.S.
Treasury notes and ten-year Japanese government bonds widened 35 basis points
to 500 basis points, the widest yield spread on record and 250 basis points above
the spread at the start of 1999.

The dollar appreciated 1.7 percent against the Mexican peso during the
intermeeting period. The sharp rise in oil prices helped bolster the Mexican peso
in 1999; however, market participants think the peso may be overvalued with an
appreciation last year of almost 20 percent versus the dollar in real terms. The

IV-11
widening of the yield spread over Treasuries of bonds from Latin American
countries reflects the current higher interest rate environment in which most
major central banks are expected to tighten. Previous shifts towards higher
interest rates have proved difficult for these countries because of the high level
of debt they carry.
A few of the emerging Asian stock markets had impressive gains since the
December FOMC, driven by export demand for technology products. The best
performing markets were in Taiwan, where share prices gained 24 percent, and
in Malaysia, which had gains of nearly 20 percent.
The ruble depreciated 7 percent versus the dollar. This move was attributed
partly to seasonal factors, as Russia generally experiences increased demand for
imports at this time of the year, accompanied by a slowdown in exports.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent information suggests that activity in most of the major industrial
countries continued to expand at a healthy pace into the fourth quarter. Growth
in Europe appears to have remained well above recent trends, and
unemployment rates have continued to fall. The pace of expansion may have
moderated a bit in Canada, but is still very strong. The Japanese economy
remains much weaker than those of the other major industrial countries, but
recent indicators suggest that growth turned mildly positive in the fourth quarter
following a third-quarter decline.
Consumer price inflation remains generally under control throughout the
industrial countries. While twelve-month inflation has increased recently as a
result of rising energy prices, core inflation remains well-behaved. Signs of
incipient pressure in the robust U.K. economy, however, were strong enough to
prompt an increase in official interest rates in January. In contrast, prices
continue to decline on a year-over-year basis in Japan.
In Japan, recent information suggests that the economy expanded slightly in the
fourth quarter, although key sectors remain weak. Industrial production adjusted
for the number of working days was up 0.8 percent relative to the third quarter
on average in October and November. Orders and shipments of machinery also
were up sharply in October-November relative to the third quarter, suggesting
some rebound in business fixed investment after a third-quarter decline.
However, consumer demand remains sluggish, with household expenditures and
new car registrations both down in October and November on average compared
with the third quarter. Housing starts also have been low in the past few months
following a burst of tax-related activity earlier in the year.
The Japanese labor market has improved a little in the past few months. The
unemployment rate edged down to 4.5 percent in November, while the offers-to-
applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the
number of officially registered job seekers) rose to 0.49, somewhat above the
record low of 0.46 in August. The most recent consumer behavior survey (third-
quarter) showed an improvement in attitudes toward job prospects, although the
overall consumer sentiment index was little changed.
Deflation continues in both goods and real estate prices. In December, the
Tokyo core CPI was down 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and the wholesale
price index was down 1.5 percent despite a sharp increase in the price of oil. A
recent survey of residential land prices showed a decline of 7 percent in the year
ending December 1 in the Tokyo and Osaka areas and a 6 percent decline in the
Nagoya area.

On December 19, the Japanese Cabinet approved a draft of the FY 2000 budget,
starting in April. Spending is expected to increase nearly 4 percent from the
initial budget for the current fiscal year. However, because of the large
supplemental budget for FY 1999 enacted in November of last year, planned
spending is actually down somewhat on a fiscal year basis. On a calendar year
basis, fiscal policy is estimated to be roughly neutral in 2000, as most of the
spending in the supplemental budget will occur in the first part of this year.
Excluding the social security surplus, the calendar year 2000 budget deficit is
estimated to be nearly 10 percent of GDP. With the gross government debt-to-
GDP ratio now in excess of 100 percent, Finance Minister Miyazawa has
indicated that further stimulus is unlikely this year, and that budget deficits for
future years are likely to be smaller.
The Japanese ruling coalition decided at the end of December to postpone the
termination of the present unlimited bank deposit guarantee for one year from

IV-14
the initially scheduled date of April 1, 2001. The postponement, which applies
to all categories of deposit-taking financial institutions, reflects policymakers'
concern that smaller institutions might be damaged by a shift of funds to large,
healthier banks if the present guarantees were removed too soon. After April
2002, the deposit guarantee per depositor will be limited to ¥10 million yen (a
little less than $100,000), as it was under the previous system before June 1995.
Market reaction was generally critical of the extension, which was taken as
evidence of a lessened willingness of the government to encourage banking
sector reform
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for 1999 was $108 billion at an annual rate,
little changed from 1998. Denominated in dollars, exports were up about 8
percent from their 1998 averages, while imports were up about 11 percent, partly
reflecting a jump in the value of oil imports in the latter part of the year.
Japanese exports to developing Asia surged last year, as recovery in these
countries has taken hold, but exports to Europe have declined significantly from
1998 levels.
In the euro area, recent information suggests that the pace of economic
expansion remained robust in the fourth quarter. In October, industrial
production (excluding construction) for the area as a whole was about 1/2 percent
above the third-quarter average. Although production in Germany declined 1/2
percent in November, officials suggested that an upward revision-similar to
those made to third-quarter figures-was very likely. In Italy, where recovery in
the first half of last year was more tenuous than in most of the euro area,
industrial production posted solid gains in both October and November and was
up nearly 1 1/2 percent on average relative to the third-quarter level.
In November, the harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area remained
unchanged from October at 9.8 percent. Since mid-1997, the harmonized rate
has declined by nearly 2 percentage points to its lowest point since 1992.
Although the decline has been most pronounced in some of the smaller
countries, notably Spain, Ireland, and the Netherlands, unemployment rates have
fallen in the larger countries as well.
Euro-area harmonized CPI inflation continues to rise, due largely to increases in
energy prices. In December, euro-area consumer prices were up 1.7 percent over
the previous-year level; excluding food and energy the increase was a little more
than 1 percent, up slightly from November. Noticeable differences still exist
among individual countries, with inflation rates in Germany, Austria and France
remaining considerably below those in Ireland and Spain.

Forward-looking indicators are generally positive. The overall economic
sentiment index rose slightly in December following sharp gains in the
preceding months and was up about 1 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole.
Confidence improved in the fourth quarter in all three components of the index--
consumer, construction, and business--although confidence in the construction
sector fell back somewhat in December. The volume of German industry orders
was up sharply in October and November relative to the third quarter, with
strength in both the foreign and domestic components.

Fourth-quarter data suggest that economic activity in the United Kingdom
continued to expand at a brisk pace. Industrial production in October and
November on average was up ½ percent from the third-quarter level, and the
volume of retail sales increased .3 percent in the fourth quarter. Business
sentiment has improved markedly since 1998. Business confidence, measured
as a diffusion index of output expectations, improved from -23.0 in the fourth
quarter of 1998 to +10.7 in the fourth quarter of 1999, although weakness in
export orders continues to be a negative factor.
Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate edged down to 4.0 percent in December 1999, the lowest rate in 20 years,
and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate remained at a
record low 5.9 percent for the three months centered in October. Average
annual earnings growth was 5 percent in November, somewhat above the level
of 4.5 percent that the Bank of England has suggested is the maximum
compatible with its 2½ percent inflation target. In addition, recent data on
prices for services and inputs suggest that inflationary pressures may be
building, although the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest rates) remains below the target. The Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee raised official interest rates 25 basis points in
January, citing expectations that consumer spending will continue to grow as a
result of increases in wealth, labor income and household borrowing.

Economic indicators in Canada for the fourth quarter suggest that real GDP
slowed somewhat from the third quarter's rapid pace, although growth remains
quite strong. GDP grew only slightly in October, largely due to a decline in
manufacturing output from September's high level, but was still nearly ½
percent above the third-quarter average. Forward-looking indicators suggest
continued expansion. Although new manufacturing orders fell in both October
and November, the decline was mainly confined to the motor vehicle industry,
where orders, which tend to be volatile, were up sharply in the third quarter.
Excluding this industry, new orders were up 2.1 percent in October and
November on average from the third quarter level. In addition, employment
surged in the fourth quarter, pushing the unemployment rate down to an
eighteen-year low of 6.9 percent in December. These job gains were widely
distributed across industries, and most were full-time.
After picking up earlier in the year, core inflation (which excludes food and
energy prices) has remain subdued in recent months. In the fourth quarter, core
prices rose only 0.3 percent. The twelve-month change in core prices was 1.6
percent in December, comfortably within the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3

percent target range for core prices, although higher energy prices pushed the
twelve-month rate of overall inflation from 2.2 percent in November to 2.6
percent in December.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
The Mexican economy has continued to grow rapidly, driven by buoyant export
demand from the United States and an emerging rebound in Mexican domestic
demand. Elsewhere in Latin America, recent data suggest that recovery in
Argentina is taking hold, as the economy begins to shake off the effects of the
deep recession. Current indicators for Brazil are mixed, while economic activity
in Venezuela (held back by lingering political uncertainty and the effects of the
December storms) has started to bottom out. Inflationary pressures in these
countries generally remain well contained.
Recent indicators for developing Asia paint a picture of sustained and rapid
recovery. Deflation appears to be easing in China and Hong Kong, and price
pressures elsewhere in the region remain muted. There is, however, early
evidence suggesting that wage growth in Korea may be rising, as the country
continues its remarkably strong recovery.
The Ecuadorean sucre plunged nearly 20 percent during the first week of
January, prompting Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad to announce a plan to
dollarize the economy. Subsequently, President Mahuad was removed by a coup
and replaced by Vice President Gustavo Noboa, who has said that he will
continue with dollarization.
In Brazil, industrial production was roughly unchanged in November, following
two months of expansion. Unemployment fell in December, mostly reflecting a
decline in the number of individuals seeking employment. Altogether, recent
data provide a mixed picture of economic activity. The mixed performance of
the economy, however, has helped to keep inflationary pressures at bay. The
IPC-A, the CPI targeted by the central bank, rose 0.9 percent in December,
bringing the yearly increase to just 9 percent. The rise was below the inflation
target's 10 percent upper bound. According to staff estimates, core inflation
(excluding energy and food prices) was between 6 and 7 percent during 1999.
The current account deficit narrowed from $33 billion in 1998 to $24 billion in
1999, a change amounting to about 1 percent of 1998 GDP, reflecting a
narrowing of the trade deficit. Imports grew about 2 percent, while exports shot
up about 15 percent. Foreign direct investment for the year stood at about
$30 billion, approximately one-third of which reflected investments related to
privatizations.
The Brazilian central bank kept the target overnight interest rate unchanged at
19 percent, with no bias as to the future direction of interest rates. The spread
between dollar-denominated Brazilian government bonds and comparable U.S.
Treasuries, a measure of investor perceptions of default risk, has continued the

IV-23
decline recorded since last August, apparently reflecting an improvement in the
political picture and improved prospects for the passage of important fiscal
reforms.

Mexico continued to grow rapidly during the third quarter, with real GDP up
8.4 percent. Although booming exports remain the main engine of growth,
driven in large part by the strong U.S. economy, there are now indications that
the contribution of domestic demand may be increasing as well Every domestic
sector except mining showed considerable gains in the November 1999
industrial production report. The strong growth is beginning to fuel imports,
which in the fourth quarter of 1999 rose nearly 7.5 percent over the previous
quarter. The current account deficit widened in the third quarter, but it is still
down significantly from its 1998 level. Consumer price inflation, at 12.3 percent
for 1999, came in under the government's 13 percent target. Nevertheless, the
Bank of Mexico decided in mid-January to tighten monetary policy by
increasing the amount the domestic interbank markets are left short of reserves,
in order to stem what it termed "latent" inflationary pressures.
In late December, the Mexican Congress approved the government's 2000
budget, which calls for further cuts in the government's budget deficit to
1 percent of GDP, down from 1¼ percent in 1999. The budget allocates nearly
$4 billion for the Bank Deposit Insurance Institute, the agency responsible for
administering the bank bailout program resulting from Mexico's 1994-95 crisis.

In Argentina, data released since the last Greenbook generally suggest that the
recovery is strengthening. Industrial production rose 1.7 percent in December
over the previous month, with gains widespread across industries, and although
industrial production was down 6.8 percent for 1999 as a whole, the second half
of the year showed positive growth. In November, the trade surplus was
$1.2 billion, boosted by the first 12-month growth in exports in over a year and a
decline in imports. The unemployment rate was 13.8 percent in October-better
than most analysts had expected. However, consumer prices continued to fall.
The latest price data for December show a slight month-over-month decline and
a drop of 1.8 percent from a year earlier.
Financial market conditions in Argentina have been generally favorable over the
past month. The passage of a stringent fiscal package for 2000 and the
resolution of Y2K concerns have helped take the sting out of an announcement
that the 1999 budget deficit will be around $7 billion-$2 billion over the latest
IMF target. During the first weeks of January, there was a precipitous drop in
short-term domestic interest rates. The 30-day deposit rate in pesos fell over
200 basis points since late December, to around 8 percent, and the spread over
dollar-denominated rates of the same duration narrowed to below 100 basis
points for the first time since August. However, despite this promising start to
the year, market concerns remain about Argentina's financial viability. The

IV-25
government must borrow over $14 billion on the markets this year to cover its
financing needs. To guard against international markets drying up, Argentine
officials are currently negotiating with the IMF over a new loan program that
could provide more funds than does the current $2.8 billion Extended Fund
Facility.

As Venezuela ended the year, output appeared to be bottoming out, but
continued political uncertainty and the aftermath of a natural disaster seem to be
limiting its prospects. GDP fell 0.7 percent over the second half of the year and
4.6 percent for the year as a whole. Reflecting these conditions, consumer prices
rose a relatively restrained 20.2 percent over the 12 months ending in
December-the lowest annual inflation rate in over a decade. Furthermore,
uncertainties surrounding the new constitution (which was resoundingly
approved in mid-December) remain, and there has been much reshuffling of top
officials over the past month.
In mid-December, torrential storms led to massive flooding in coastal areas near
Caracas, causing extensive damage and major disruptions. Officials are
predicting that the cost of rebuilding will exceed $10 billion, with at least a
quarter of a million people unemployed in the short run. The significant runup
in oil prices over the second half of 1999 has been one positive economic
development, however, and should help sustain the economy through the
rebuilding period.

In Korea, recent data suggest that economic activity has continued to increase at
a very robust pace. Industrial production rose strongly in November, led by
rapid increases in the output of automobiles, office machinery and transportation
equipment. The inventory to shipments ratio edged down further in November,
reaching an all-time low, suggesting that growth this year could be supported by
a revival in inventory investment.
Government officials have indicated that they expect real GDP to grow 6 percent
this year, after 10 percent growth last year, and aim to contain inflation below
3 percent. Actual inflation ended 1999 below 2 percent, but there are some
indications of a revival of inflationary pressures. Average monthly wages at
business firms rose 11 percent from year-earlier levels over the first three
quarters of last year, compared with a 3 percent decline over the same period the
previous year. Much of the rise in wages last year represented jumps in overtime
pay and bonuses, but base salaries also rose 5 percent. Tending to offset this
acceleration in wages has been the rapid growth of productivity, with real GDP
increasing nearly 15 percent from year-earlier levels over the first three quarters
of last year, while employment rose only 3 percent over the same period.
In its January policy statement, the central bank indicated that it intends to
continue its policy of holding the overnight rate unchanged for the time being.
Bank officials attributed this decision mainly to the ongoing vulnerability of
financial markets to lingering structural problems, pointing in particular to the
risk of large-scale outflows from investment trust companies in February when

IV-27
depositors at these institutions will be permitted to redeem up to 95 percent of
their money currently invested through them in the troubled Daewoo Chaebol.

Recovery in the ASEAN region continued in a choppy manner, with growth
rates varying across countries. The most recent data releases indicate that GDP
in Thailand expanded at a rapid pace in the third quarter and that, on balance,
industrial production grew strongly in both Malaysia and Thailand during this
same period. However, industrial production data point to some fourth-quarter
weakness in the Philippines and lackluster performance in Singapore.
Reflecting continued excess capacity, consumer price inflation remains muted
throughout most of the region, increasing only slightly in recent months.
Imports rose across most of the region in November, causing trade surpluses to
decline. Exports were mixed, falling off in Thailand, Indonesia, and the
Philippines, but increasing in Malaysia and Singapore.

Indonesia signed a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund, calling
for a $5 billion loan, subject to approval by the IMF's Executive Board. The
total includes about $1.35 billion remaining under a previous IMF loan package,
which had been cut off after a financial scandal in the fall of 1999, in addition to
new money. The letter of intent envisages medium-term GDP growth of
5-6 percent a year and inflation below 5 percent.
Economic activity in China continued to recover strongly in the fourth quarter,
with real GDP up 10.6 percent. The pickup in growth in the second half of
1999, largely owing to increased exports and public investment, brought the
annual growth rate to 7.1 percent, slightly ahead of the government's target of
7 percent. China's trade surplus widened significantly in the fourth quarter, with
exports remaining roughly flat and imports falling about 8 percent. Concerns
about a renminbi devaluation have eased, largely as a result of continued
improvement in China's external performance and an increase in foreign
exchange reserves. Preliminary estimates show actual foreign direct investment
slipping to $38 billion last year from about $46 billion in 1998.
The authorities' efforts to stimulate economic growth continued. China's broad
M2 money supply was almost 15 percent higher at the end of 1999 than a year
earlier, and the central bank has announced a similar money supply growth
target for this year. On the fiscal front, the government recently unveiled a plan
to boost spending this year on infrastructure in China's relatively backward
western regions. Meanwhile, the government announced a series of economic
reforms, including measures to promote private enterprise and plans to cut its
stake in selected state-owned enterprises from 62 percent to 51 percent.

In Hong Kong, recent trade data provide evidence that the economy continued
to recover at a strong pace. Exports rose about 4 percent in November, driven in
large part by the rebound elsewhere in Asia. Domestic demand may also have
strengthened, partly reflecting the positive impact of rising stock prices and
falling unemployment on consumer sentiment. The unemployment rate was
6 percent in the October-December period, down from a recent peak of
6.3 percent in the March-May period. However, high real interest rates
continued to act as a drag on private investment. Consumer prices registered
further declines on a 12-month basis, although deflationary pressures may be
easing as property prices appear to have bottomed out.

In Taiwan, industrial production expanded strongly in the fourth quarter, driven
by rapid growth in the electronics and information technology sectors, as the
economy continued to recover from the September earthquake. Taiwan's
exports grew about 11 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, largely reflecting
strong global demand for technology-related goods. For 1999 as a whole,
exports increased 10 percent from a year earlier, while imports were nearly
6 percent higher. Consumer prices rose a scant 0.1 percent in 1999, with
bumper harvests late in the year helping to push food prices lower and
outweighing the impact of rising energy prices.

In Russia, the latest data have provided evidence that economic performance
has been improving on balance. Despite a moderate contraction in the third
quarter, GDP was still up 5.6 percent from its year earlier level. Industrial
production has shown double-digit 12-month growth for the past six months,
and inflation has fallen. The ruble has weakened significantly against the dollar
since the beginning of the new year, but the Russian equity market has continued
to rise, with the dollar value of the Russian Trading Stock reaching an 18-month
high in mid-January.
President Yeltsin's resignation on December 31, 1999, left Prime Minister Putin
as acting President of Russia and the candidate most likely to win the March
presidential elections. Putin's position also was bolstered by the December
parliamentary elections, when centrist blocs receiving his endorsement increased
their strength in the Duma.
