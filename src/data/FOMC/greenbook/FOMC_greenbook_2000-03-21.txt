Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Real GDP almost surely has decelerated from the 7 percent annualized pace of
the fourth quarter, but the underlying thrust of expansion has remained strong.
Consumer spending has continued to rise at a remarkable clip, while business
fixed investment evidently has registered strength after a lull in the fourth
quarter. Although labor markets are still extremely tight, the official statistics
have given only hints of a pickup in compensation gains. And, with the notable
exception of the energy sector, price inflation has remained subdued.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand has been robust thus far this year. Although uneven weather
contributed to some choppiness in the month-to-month changes, the average
increase in private payroll employment in January and February was only a little
below the pace of 1999. The unemployment rate held near 4 percent, as the
household survey registered a large gain in employment, while the labor force
participation rate posted an equally sharp jump to a record 67.6 percent.
About 360,000 jobs were added to private payrolls over the January-February
period, with almost all of the increase coming in January. Construction
employment fell back in February after an outsized gain in January, when
relatively mild weather during the survey reference week likely allowed
construction firms to productively retain workers they would otherwise have laid
off. Services added a meager 6,000 jobs in February after a stronger-than-usual
January. Some of this weakness, especially in agricultural services and
amusement services, probably also reflected a payback for January's weather-
related strength. However, the weather cannot explain the bulk of the slow pace
of hiring in other industries, such as business services. Indeed, for services as a
whole, the average monthly employment increase of about 75,000 in January and
February was well below last year's average monthly pace of more than 120,000.
Whether this slackening represents mere statistical noise or either reduced
demand or supply constraints is not clear. With regard to the latter possibility,
stories of firms having difficulty finding qualified workers remain plentiful,
although such accounts do not seem to have intensified since last year.
Employment gains in retail trade, unlike those in other industries, were steady in
the first two months of the year. with about 35,000 jobs added each month.
Manufacturing employment also increased in both January and February,
underscoring the turnaround in this sector after the long downswing that began
in the wake of the Asian economic slump. Given powerful productivity trends
in manufacturing, however, job gains will likely continue to be modest at best
even if the economy remains strong.

Government employment increased 13,000 in February on the strength of
20,000 hires for the decennial census. We estimate that census employment will
increase dramatically over the next three months from its February level of
46,000, to a peak level of about 400,000 in May. Based on the 1998 census
"dress rehearsal," we expect that a bit more than half of the hires will hold other
jobs. As a result, the household employment figures--which count the number
of employed persons--should be affected less than the payroll employment
figures--which count the number of jobs. The Census Bureau is aggressively
seeking enumerators, using both heavy advertising and market-sensitive wages.1
The average workweek followed the same up-and-down pattern as employment
gains in January and February. On balance, however, production-worker hours
in February were up 2-1/4 percent (annual rate) from the average for the fourth
quarter. In addition, hours worked by the self-employed appear to be on track
for a sizable gain this quarter; consequently, total nonfarm business sector hours
likely will increase faster than production-worker hours, a pattern that suggests
some damping of measured productivity growth.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.0 percent in
January but edged back up to 4.1 percent in February; it has been at or below
4.1 percent since October. The "potential worker" rate has moved much the
same way. The labor force participation rate--which had fluctuated around
67 percent for more than three years--shot up to 67.5 percent in January and then
increased another tenth in February. Although a similarly timed spike in January
and February of last year suggests that at least part of the recent increase may
reflect some statistical flaw, this year's even higher levels may be a sign that the
extraordinary availability of job opportunities is finally attracting some
additional people into the labor force. The perception of ample job availability,
which is evident in household surveys such as the Conference Board's,
apparently is also affecting the behavior of those already employed: The ratio of
job leavers unemployed less than five weeks to total employment--a rough proxy
for the voluntary quit rate--remained high in January and February.
Other indicators suggest that labor demand continues to expand briskly. The
four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance fell to
about 275,000--extremely low relative to the labor force. The Manpower survey
index of net hiring strength remained high, and, while the more erratic National
Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) measure bounced down in
February, it remained above its level of a year ago. A sizable fraction of the
1. For the "dress rehearsal," roughly a fifth of new hires came from outside the labor force.
We believe that the fraction will be slightly higher this year, as the pool of unemployed persons
is somewhat smaller.

NFIB sample continued to report difficulties in filling job openings, and the

technical, professional, production, and service workers.
As a result of the revised figures on real output, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual
rate of 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999; it was up 3.6 percent from a
year earlier. We believe that the increases in output and productivity in the
fourth quarter may be overstated by about 0.6 percentage point (annual rate)
because of an overstatement of federal purchases, but even so, productivity gains
in both the third and fourth quarters were huge.2

Industrial Production
Industrial production rose sharply over the first two months of the year, with a
1.1 percent gain in January followed by an increase of 0.3 percent in February.
The increases in manufacturing output were nearly identical to these. The
factory operating rate has risen half a percentage point since December, but, at
80.9 percent, it remains below the long-run average.
After having risen 400,000 units in January, motor vehicle assemblies fell back
by a like amount in February to an annual rate of 12.9 million units; current
production schedules also call for a 12.9 million unit rate in March. The
operating rate for motor vehicles and parts--at 83.9 percent in February--is well
2. Estimated fourth-quarter output was boosted by a surge in payments to defense
contractors that the BEA assumed reflected goods and services delivered in the fourth quarter.
We think that about $10 billion (annual rate) of the increase was for items delivered in the first
quarter of this year.

above the 1967-99 average of 76.9 percent.3 Second-quarter production plans
point to a step-up to a 13-1/4 million unit rate, as the industry--having raised its
assessment of underlying sales trends--wants not only to meet current demand
but also to replenish dealer inventories.

Boeing engineers and technicians have been on strike since February 9. The
strike appears to have had no impact on production last month. However,
because these workers contribute importantly to the planning stages of the
production process, assemblies may be affected later this year. In the
meanwhile, deliveries have been slowed because engineers and technicians are
involved in the certification of aircraft before delivery. Moreover, the discovery
of a construction flaw in recently installed fasteners for wings and fuselages has
required reinspection of jetliners in use as well as those poised for delivery;
Boeing has warned that this problem could exacerbate delivery lags, but the
effect on production, if any, has yet to be determined.
The high-technology sector is booming. Sizable increases in the production of
computer and communications equipment over January and February indicate
that these industries are recovering quickly from the Y2K-related deceleration
observed during the third and fourth quarters of last year. In the semiconductor
industry, heavy demand for computer components has kept high-end
3. Utilization for light truck production has been about at capacity since last spring.
However, utilization rates for autos and total motor vehicle parts, although up noticeably from a
year ago, have been a little under 83 percent recently. The operating rate for heavy truck
manufacturing is also high, but there is considerable slack at makers of medium trucks.

microprocessors in short supply despite rapid production advances in recent
months.
Elsewhere within manufacturing, the output of durables, outside of high-tech
goods and motor vehicles and parts, edged down in February but has been rising,
on balance, since mid-1999. The upturn has been notable in farm and
construction machinery as well as in steel. The production of nondurables was
boosted in recent months by gains in the paper and chemicals industries, along
with an uptick in apparel output.
Looking ahead, the February survey by the National Association of Purchasing
Management indicated that new orders continued to rise and that backlogs
remained high. Looking at the Census "M-3" data, real durable goods orders, as
adjusted by the staff, weakened in January, but the underlying trend in the series
remains very positive.

Manufacturing capacity is expected to expand 4.2 percent in 2000, compared
with 4.7 percent last year. The deceleration reflects cuts in investment in factory
plant and equipment that have already occurred; going forward, investment in
the manufacturing sector seems to be rising as the recent pickup in output has
elevated utilization rates and bolstered profits in many industries.

Consumer Spending and Income
Consumer spending has continued to post big gains, and the fundamentals still
look favorable. Growth in real disposable income has remained strong;
household wealth has moved up considerably, on net, in recent quarters; and
consumer confidence remained high in February.
The already impressive demand for new light vehicles escalated even further
early this year. Sales of light vehicles stepped up to an annual rate of
17.7 million units in January and then surged to a pace of 19 million units in
February--the second highest rate on record.5 According to confidential data,
the increase in demand so far this quarter has been concentrated in retail sales.
Despite GM's $500 rebate coupon program (which expired at the end of
February), industry analysts suggest that only part of the spike in consumer
purchases in February can be attributed to the sweetening of incentives at the
major firms. In the near term, the strong economy and favorable pricing--
including still generous incentives--are likely to continue to buoy demand for
new light vehicles.
Purchases of goods other than motor vehicles have continued to expand briskly.
According to the advance release, nominal spending in the retail control category
rose 1.1 percent in February. The increase reflected higher expenditures in
nearly all major categories, although a huge rise in nominal outlays at gasoline
stations likely owed to the sharply higher prices that prevailed at the pump in
February. (Indeed, physical-product data from the Department of Energy
indicate that real purchases of gasoline declined.) On the basis of the retail sales
data and our forecast of consumer prices, we estimate that real outlays for goods
excluding motor vehicles increased 0.4 percent in February, putting the average
level of spending for the first two months of the year up 1-1/4 percent from the
fourth quarter.
The Census Bureau recently released its first-ever estimate of retail sales made
over the Internet. The new series covers both traditional brick-and-mortar
establishments and firms that operate exclusively online.6 According to Census,
retail e-commerce sales totaled $5.3 billion (not seasonally adjusted) in the
fourth quarter (quarterly rate), or about 0.6 percent of total retail sales in that
5. Total light vehicle sales rocketed to an annual rate of 21.6 million units in September
1986, which was the first instance of "fire-sale" incentive programs designed to clear out the
previous year's models. Sales were appreciably lower in both of the adjacent months.
6. Beginning in October 1999, the Census Bureau asked firms to report e-commerce sales
separately on the Monthly Retail Trade survey, and quarterly releases of the data currently are
planned.

period.7 These online purchases were already embedded in the previously
released monthly retail sales figures but were not identified separately. The
estimates do not include purchases of services, such as travel (lodging and
transportation) and financial services. Census will collect data on purchases of
services made over the Internet in its annual survey of service providers.
Information on e-commerce activity by manufacturers and wholesalers will also
be collected in the annual surveys of these establishments.
Real PCE services continued to expand briskly through January, when outlays
rose 0.6 percent. Spending was boosted by higher expenditures for energy
services resulting from a return to more seasonal temperatures after a warmer-
than-usual fourth quarter. In January, real purchases for brokerage services rose
nearly 2-1/2 percent, reflecting the jump in trading activity that month. The
"other recreational services" category climbed 1.3 percent, or about $1.7 billion,
in January, with almost $1 billion of the gain attributable to higher payments to
Internet service providers.8 Looking beyond January, real energy outlays have
likely declined in recent weeks because temperatures have generally been
warmer than usual. In contrast, services spending has likely been bolstered in
February and March by high levels of stock trading.
Nominal personal income rose 0.7 percent in January. As is the case each
January, income was boosted by the federal government's annual pay raise for
civilian and military personnel and by cost-of-living adjustments to social
security benefits and other federal transfer programs.9 Personal tax and nontax
payments fell in January because of refunds by some states, changes in current
tax laws, and indexation provisions in the tax code. After factoring in the
decline in tax payments and the increase in consumer prices, real disposable
personal income also increased 0.7 percent in January and was up 3.9 percent
over the preceding twelve months. Data on hours and earnings for February
suggest only a modest gain in wage and salary income that month.
7. On March 1, the day before Census published its e-commerce figures, the National
Retail Federation and Forrester Research (NRF/FR) released an estimate of online purchases of
both goods and services by consumers. According to NRF/FR, these purchases totaled
$2.8 billion in January (not seasonally adjusted) and about $20 billion for 1999 as a whole. The
largest categories for online sales in January were air tickets, computer hardware and software,
books, and apparel. The total for goods expenditures in the NRF/FR estimate amounted to
about 1 percent of total retail sales in January--somewhat higher than the Census Bureau's
e-commerce share of 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. Unlike the Census Bureau's
Monthly Retail Trade survey of firms, the NRF/FR estimates were obtained from a survey of
consumers.
8. BEA's estimates of real PCE for Internet service providers are based on quarterly data
from these companies on the number of subscribers.
9. These and other special factors boosted the increase in personal income 0.1 percentage
point, in nominal terms, in January.

After climbing to a historical high in the fourth quarter, the ratio of net worth to
income has edged down thus far in the first quarter but remains well above its
level in the same period last year. The NIPA personal saving rate moved up
0.4 percentage point in January, to 1.4 percent; however, it was still nearly
1/2 percentage point below its fourth-quarter level, and it has tumbled
2 percentage points over the past year.10
The cheer with which households greeted the new year has ebbed only a bit,
according to recent survey data. Consumer sentiment as measured by both the
Michigan and Conference Board surveys climbed to new highs in January and
eased off only slightly from those levels in February.
Housing Markets
Residential construction activity remained high in early 2000, aided in part by
favorable weather. But underlying the boom in building has been a buoyant
demand for homes in the face of a 125-basis-point rise on thirty-year fixed-rate
mortgages last year. Home sales have been supported by sustained growth in
employment and income and increased wealth--which have given people the
wherewithal and the confidence to make such purchases.
Starts of single-family homes declined 2 percent in January, to an annual rate of
1.40 million units. However, the decrease was from an upward-revised
December reading that was the fastest pace in twenty-one years. Construction of
single-family homes has likely been sustained not only by current sales but also
by a large backlog of projects waiting to be started.
Sales of new single-family homes retraced their December jump in January,
but--at a level just below the 1999 average--they remained quite robust by
historical standards. In contrast, sales of existing homes have slackened
somewhat since last July. Some analysts have suggested that supply constraints
have been holding back sales of existing homes recently; in January, inventories
of existing homes for sale were at a record low relative to sales, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
Tight supplies of houses for sale may be showing through to higher prices,
especially for existing homes. The repeat-sales price index for existing homes
increased 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter (year-over-year), which is the most
rapid advance since late 1989. The rate of increase of the constant-quality price
10. Our reading of the available data on tax receipts suggests that BEA's estimates of
personal tax payments are a touch on the low side. We estimate that--all else equal-the
understatement of taxes has been boosting the published personal saving rate by increasing
amounts since the beginning of last year; we believe the effect in January amounts to
1/4 percentage point.

index for new homes slowed to 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, from
5.7 percent in the third quarter, which was the fastest rate in nearly six years.
Near-term indicators of housing demand have moved down or been flat in recent
weeks, but for the most part they remained on the high side. Builders' rating of
new home sales moved down further in early March, while the four-week
moving average of the Mortgage Bankers Association index of purchase
applications for home mortgages has been little changed, on balance. The
Michigan SRC measure of household perceptions of homebuying conditions was
about unchanged in February, remaining in the narrow range it has occupied
since declining sharply last summer.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts soared 18 percent in January, to nearly a
380,000 unit annual rate, the strongest reading since early 1999. Adjusted
permits in January were up almost the same amount as starts, indicating that the
starts reading should not be disregarded as a statistical aberration. Nonetheless,
the January starts figure is well above the average 330,000 pace of last year,
which is probably closer to the current underlying trend.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Business expenditures on equipment and software
started off the new year on a strong note. Outlays have been boosted by the
recent acceleration in output and profits, the end of Y2K-related computer
system "lockdowns," and the effects of Internet expansion and
telecommunications deregulation on the demand for communications equipment.
With orders recently running at very high levels, the near-term outlook appears
to be for continued brisk advances in spending.
Shipments of computing equipment surged 16-1/2 percent (in nominal terms) in
January, reversing the large declines of November and December. The
substantial fluctuations in the recent data likely were partly the result of
Y2K-related factors. Smoothing through these fluctuations, nominal
expenditures on computing equipment appear to have maintained their steep
uptrend. However, information from the PPI for January suggests that slower-
than-usual price declines may restrain the current quarter's increase in real
computer spending a bit.
Elsewhere in the high-tech sector, outlays on communications equipment are set
for a large gain in the current quarter. Shipments increased 10 percent in
January, and orders have been exceptionally robust of late. Indeed, relative to
shipments, the backlog of unfilled orders has risen to a quite high level by recent
historical standards. Demand has been boosted by the expansion of the Internet
and wireless technology and by the effects of deregulation in the

telecommunications industry. The desire for high-speed Internet access is
spurring spending on "broadband" networks.11 Spending on switches and other
telephone-related equipment is being boosted by increased competition:
Competitive local exchange carriers still service only a small fraction of the
nation's telephone lines (3 percent as of the second quarter of 1999), but over the
past two years they have been adding a million lines a quarter and are spending
heavily to expand their networks. The likely continuation of these developments
and the current backlog of orders point to further sizable gains in outlays for
communications equipment for some time to come.12
In the transportation sector, business demand has been mixed. Fleet sales of
light motor vehicles (confidential data) averaged a little higher in January and
February than in the fourth quarter. However, despite the strength in the
economy, sales and orders of medium and heavy trucks declined on balance in
January and February relative to the fourth quarter. The slowdown in demand
partly reflects pressure on truckers' profits from higher costs for fuel, labor, and
insurance. Business spending on transportation equipment this quarter is also
likely to be held down by the delay in domestic aircraft deliveries associated
with the strike at Boeing.
Business spending on items other than high-tech and transportation equipment is
making a strong recovery from the sluggishness during the first three quarters of
1999. Real outlays rose at an annual rate of 9 percent in the fourth quarter, and
orders have been robust in recent months, increasing 13 percent over the
December-January period. Moreover, the strength in orders reflects an increase
in demand extending across a wide range of subcategories of equipment and
machinery. With accelerator effects from the recent pickup in growth of
business output--especially in the manufacturing sector--providing a positive
impetus, spending on this grouping of equipment is likely to move up in coming
months.
Nonresidential structures. Nominal spending on nonresidential buildings
jumped 3.2 percent in January, the biggest increase since mid-1998. The
January gain accelerated an upturn in expenditures that began last fall. Looking
ahead, contracts for private nonresidential construction fell 5-1/2 percent in
11. For example, according to the FCC, two million high-speed cable modems were in
service at the end of 1999, compared with just 50,000 at the beginning of 1998. The number of
digital subscriber lines provided by local phone companies, although smaller, is also increasing
rapidly.
12. The strength in demand for communications equipment may also be boosting
nonresidential construction: Whereas the cost of the equipment itself is counted by BEA as
investment in equipment and software, the value added when the equipment is installed is (at
least in principle) counted as investment in nonresidential structures.

January, a considerably faster pace of decline than that seen during the fourth
quarter; however, the contracts data are quite erratic, and preliminary estimates
are often revised up. On the whole, indicators of conditions in commercial real
estate markets seem quite positive.
Spending for construction of office buildings increased nearly 4 percent in
January, boosting expenditures to a level almost matching the high recorded last
September. For the twelve months ending in January, construction spending for
office buildings was up 7 percent.
Construction spending for other commercial structures increased 4-1/2 percent in
January after having risen 8-1/2 percent over the past year. Indeed, the level of
spending in January was the highest on record. The expansion of e-commerce
has unclear implications for the demand for structures in this category:
Although spending on retail selling space is thought by some analysts to have
been reduced, many firms in the sector are building warehouses to facilitate
efficient distribution.
Outlays for industrial buildings were little changed in January. Spending on
these structures has been fairly flat, on balance, in recent months following a
nearly 25 percent drop between early 1998 and mid-1999.
Business Inventories
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles
rose at an annual rate of $42 billion in January, compared with the $70 billion
pace in the fourth quarter. With total non-vehicle manufacturing and trade
shipments and sales increasing 0.6 percent in January, the inventory-sales ratio
for this category held steady at 1.28 months, the lowest value on record.
Manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of $19 billion (book value) in
January, about matching the pace of stockbuilding during the fourth quarter.13
January's accumulation reflected an increase in inventories of finished goods;
stocks of both materials and supplies and work-in-process inventories were little
changed. With shipments increasing 1 percent, the inventory-shipments ratio for
manufacturing fell to a new low for this series.
Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles increased a hefty $26 billion
(annual rate) in January, somewhat above the fourth-quarter pace, but the
inventory-sales ratio remained at its relatively low December level. Notably,
13. In real terms, manufacturers' stocks rose just $10 billion in the fourth quarter. We
expect that January' s book-value accumulation will translate into a similar pace of real
stockbuilding.

with sales extremely strong over the past year, inventory-sales ratios are down a
good deal from the recent peaks recorded in late 1998 and early 1999.
Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles decreased at an annual rate of
$3.2 billion in January, compared with a $30 billion rate of increase in the fourth
quarter. Stocks were drawn down in most major categories after sizable
increases at the end of last year. Whereas the pace of stockbuilding in the retail
sector has been considerable, on net, in recent months, the inventory-sales ratio
has been about flat.
Government Expenditures
Federal government. Although the numbers have been bounced around by
timing quirks and other anomalies, the federal budget surplus continues to
increase. Adjusted for payment timing shifts, deposit insurance, spectrum
auction proceeds, and sales of major assets, the surplus in January was
$50 billion, up $18 billion from last January. The improvement reflects both
sizable revenue gains and the slow rise in outlays.
Spending totals in January for net interest, income security, Medicaid, and
national defense were all below the year-ago levels. Defense spending was
depressed in January, in part by what appears to have been an acceleration of
some vendor payments in December in response to Y2K concerns. The end-of-
month Daily Treasury Statement (DTS) indicates that defense vendor payments
returned to normal in February. In any event, smoothing through the monthly
fluctuations, the level of defense spending appears to have been quite strong in
recent months relative to the modest uptrend implied by the annual
appropriations figures--suggesting that a weaker pattern may lie ahead.
Receipts in January were about 10 percent above the level recorded last year.
Individual income and payroll taxes, both withheld and nonwithheld, remained
on a strong uptrend. The data from the DTS suggest that February collections
also were robust. At the same time, refunds have increased a good deal this
filing season. Total refunds issued by March 10 were about 16 percent higher
than for the same period last year. This surge in refunds predominantly reflects
faster processing of returns, owing largely to an increase in electronic filings.
The percentage of returns receiving refunds is essentially the same as last year,
while the size of the average refund is up about 6 percent.
State and local governments. Real activity appears to have been quite strong
in the state and local sector early in the first quarter. The small drop in
employment in February came after a 32,000 gain in January. Much of the
weakness last month was at local educational establishments and came on the

heels of fairly large increases the previous two months. Real construction
spending surged in January for the third consecutive month, boosted by
continued strength in highway construction that probably was associated, in part,
with persistently dry weather. However, unlike in the earlier months, real
spending on school buildings and water supply facilities rose smartly in January.
States reduced taxes, on net, for the fifth straight year in fiscal 1999, according
to a report released early this year by the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Tax cuts enacted last year will trim an estimated $7.3 billion from
revenues during fiscal 2000, or 1.7 percent of 1999 collections--the largest net
decline in revenues resulting from the recent string of tax cuts. Thirty-four states
reduced taxes last year, with significant cuts in seven states--Colorado,
Connecticut, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin--
ranging from 3 percent to 18 percent of the previous year's collections. As in
recent years, most of the reductions were in personnel income taxes. States also
reduced corporate and general sales taxes, but several states raised excise taxes
on cigarettes, gasoline, and alcoholic beverages.
Prices and Labor Costs
Consumer price inflation remained moderate early this year. Both the consumer
price index and the index excluding food and energy items rose 0.2 percent in
January. Over the twelve months ending in January, the CPI increased
2.7 percent, compared with a 1.7 percent rise over the preceding twelve months.
Higher energy prices more than accounted for the pickup. Excluding food and
energy, the CPI was up 1.9 percent from its year-earlier value, 0.5 percentage
point less than the increase over the preceding twelve months. The extremely
sharp rise in tobacco prices in late 1998 contributed importantly to the year-
earlier increase; excluding tobacco as well as food and energy items, the CPI
decelerated only 0.1 percentage point over the year ending in January, and the
introduction of geometric-means aggregation at the beginning of 1999 can more
than account for this small deceleration.14
Energy prices have continued to play an important role in recent inflation
developments. After essentially no change in October and November, consumer
energy prices rose 1.8 percent in December and another 1 percent in January.
These increases were largely a result of higher prices for gasoline and heating
14. The technical changes that have been introduced in the CPI in recent years affect the
magnitude of the upward bias that most analysts believe is a feature of the CPI and other price
indexes. The General Accounting Office recently released a report in which the members of the
Boskin Commission were asked to update their estimates of bias in the CPI. The members'
estimates currently center at 0.8 percent per year, compared with 1.1 percent in the
Commission's 1996 final report. The most important reason for the reduction in bias since 1996
was the introduction of geometric-means aggregation in 1999.

oil, and survey data for February and early March point to much larger price
increases for these products than in December and January. Increases for
gasoline and heating oil have been driven by the rise in crude oil prices to more
than $31 per barrel and, in the case of gasoline, by the diversion of production
toward heating oil and by some refinery disruptions in California. The latter
developments are leaving gasoline inventories at extremely low levels before the
summer driving season. Overall, through January, the CPI for energy has risen
nearly 15 percent since it hit bottom twelve months earlier, not quite fully
reversing the declines that began in early 1997.
These energy price increases appear to have contributed to higher prices at the
intermediate stage of processing. The PPI for core intermediate materials
excluding food and energy continued to rise in the few months through January,
with prices of goods that have a high petroleum content, such as chemicals and
plastics, posting especially large increases. Also, press reports indicate that
some transportation firms have raised rates in response to higher costs.
Certainly, anecdotal reports suggest that businesses are starting to be squeezed
by higher fuel and transportation costs. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that
these cost increases, as yet, have had any strong influence on prices at the
consumer level.
Indeed, outside of energy items, consumer price increases have remained
subdued. Food prices were little changed in December and January and
increased only 1.5 percent over the twelve months ending in January. Prices of
commodities excluding food and energy edged down in January for a third
consecutive month; however; some of the January decline reflected factors that
are likely to be reversed in February and March. Specifically, the CPI for
apparel dropped 1.1 percent in January, a decline that may have been
exaggerated by seasonal adjustment difficulties. In addition, prices for new cars
and trucks came down with the coupon incentives put in place by General
Motors, and some uptick may be expected in March after the coupons expire.
Nevertheless, the CPI for new vehicles is down 3/4 percent over the twelve
months ending in January, and, aside from some makers having raised
destination charges, there are few signs of any impending sticker price

increases--although the higher costs associated with the rocketing of palladium
prices in commodity markets certainly has the industry concerned.15 Elsewhere,
consumer tobacco prices rose 1.6 percent in January, reflecting the wholesale
price increase that went into effect midmonth; we expect the remainder of that
price increase to enter the CPI in February.16 In addition, New York State
boosted cigarette taxes on March 1, which should lead to a further tobacco price
increase in this month's CPI.
Prices of non-energy services rose 0.3 percent in January, the same as the
average increase over the preceding two months. Owners' equivalent rent
increased 0.3 percent in January; over the three months ending in January, it rose
at a 3.1 percent annual rate after a surprisingly low 2.3 percent rate of increase
over the preceding twelve months. Price increases among other services were
fairly widespread in January, although the extremely erratic CPI for airfares
declined in January despite increases in fuel costs. Overall, prices of non-energy
services rose 2.8 percent over the twelve months ending in January, the same as
the increase over the preceding year.
Over the four quarters of 1999, most broad price measures continued to rise less
rapidly than the CPI, but they also showed more evidence of acceleration. Core
CPI prices rose 2.1 percent (a deceleration of 0.1 percentage point on a current
methods basis relative to 1998), and core PCE prices rose 1.5 percent (an
acceleration of 0.1 percentage point).17 The GDP chain-type price index rose
1.6 percent over the four quarters of 1999, 1/2 percentage point more than its
increase over 1998. This measure accelerated more than consumption prices, in
part because of a firming of investment goods prices that is attributable entirely
to a smaller decline in computer prices. Following a decrease of 28 percent in
15. Palladium is a critical component in catalytic converters. In February, prices peaked at
more than double their level last fall, reportedly adding $100 per vehicle to automakers' costs.
Prices of palladium have been erratic, but there has been a pronounced uptrend in the past
several years. News accounts attribute the movements largely to sporadic efforts by the Russian
government to drive up prices by limiting and delaying exports of the metal. The most recent
surge in palladium prices appears to be related to investor speculation that Moscow will further
choke supplies in the face of a step-up in industry demand.
16. Unlike the CPI, the PPI for tobacco declined in January. Federal excise taxes increased
10 cents per pack of cigarettes on January 1, and, in the absence of a wholesale price increase,
reduced the net price received by manufacturers. (The mid-January wholesale price increase
came after the PPI pricing date for that month and thus should appear in the February PPI data.)
17. Although the PCE price index has some advantages relative to the CPI at the quarterly
frequency, these advantages are less clear on a monthly basis. In particular, some of the non-
CPI data that underlie quarterly PCE prices are not available monthly, and the weights used in
aggregating the monthly PCE data may be somewhat erratic. In addition, the CPI is released
about two weeks before PCE. For these reasons, we do not ordinarily emphasize the monthly
PCE prices.

1998, computer prices fell at an annual rate of 19 percent in the first three
quarters of 1999 and at an annual rate of 12 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
This acceleration likely reflects strong demand and, at the end of last year,
decisions by semiconductor manufacturers to hold down production in
anticipation--largely mistaken, as it turned out--of a lull in demand before the
century date change. Although the PPI for computers posted another smaller-
than-average decline in January, anecdotal reports suggest that more rapid
production and heightened competition have caused semiconductor prices to
start declining more rapidly again, hinting that computer prices may follow.
As noted above, prices continued to firm at earlier stages of processing, at least
into January. The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose
another 0.3 percent in January, bringing the twelve-month change in this series
to 2.4 percent. Prices of crude goods excluding food and energy jumped
3.2 percent in January and are up 17 percent over the past year. Prices of
industrial commodities have been mixed, on balance, since the PPI's price quotes
were collected in mid-January. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial
prices is up about 1-3/4 percent since the time of the last Greenbook. However,
metals prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks after rising notably through
much of 1999.
The median response to the University of Michigan survey of one-year-ahead
inflation expectations was 2.9 percent in February, the same as its average level
over the fourth quarter of 1999. Near-term inflation expectations from this
survey have risen about 1/2 percentage point since the end of 1998, presumably
reflecting the actual increase in inflation that occurred over this period as energy
prices increased. The median five- to ten-year expectation of inflation from the
Michigan survey also was 2.9 percent in February; these longer-term inflation
expectations have been quite stable over the past year.
Turning to labor costs, despite anecdotal reports of labor shortages and upward
pressure on labor costs, evidence of a pickup in the pace of compensation
increases remains fairly scarce in the official statistics. Nonfarm compensation
per hour rose at an annual rate of only 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter and was
up 4.3 percent for 1999 as a whole--versus 5.3 percent in 1998. Compensation
in the employment cost index accelerated in the fourth quarter, bringing the
increase for the year to 3.4 percent, little changed from 1998. (We continue to
suspect that stock option exercises account for much of the differential between
the two compensation series.) With either measure, the strength of productivity
implies that unit labor costs actually declined over the second half of last year.
At present, our only "hard" data on labor costs in the first quarter come from the

quarterly estimates of nonfarm compensation per hour. Average hourly earnings
rose 0.3 percent in February after increasing 0.4 percent in January. Although
the pace of increase of late has been a shade faster, over the twelve months
ending in February average hourly earnings rose 3.6 percent, about the same as
the increase over the preceding twelve-month period.
Of course, average hourly earnings exclude benefits as well as bonus payments
and other forms of compensation that, reportedly, are increasingly being used to
attract and retain workers. Indeed, press accounts suggest that bonus payments
may have been quite large in the first quarter. In the motor vehicle industry,
bonuses totaled $1.8 billion, up $0.5 billion from the previous year's level, with
Ford's and Chrysler's payments even larger than last year's sizable amounts, and
GM's payment snapping back from the strike-depressed levels of 1998. Because
these bonuses are not included in the average hourly earnings data, they also will
not be reflected in the data on nonfarm compensation per hour until those data
have gone through the annual revision process. Since 1996, BEA has not made
any special adjustments in response to press reports of annual bonuses; contacts
at BEA feel that these annual bonuses will be satisfactorily captured by the
implicit assumption that bonuses increase at the same rate as other forms of
wage and salary income. By contrast, BEA does sometimes make adjustments
to capture special payments such as last fall's signing bonuses in the motor
vehicle and aircraft industries.

Domestic Financial Developments
Interest Rates and Equity Prices
The FOMC's decision in February to raise the federal funds rate 1/4 percentage
point and to proclaim its concerns about inflation risks was no surprise and
generated little response in financial markets. Federal funds and eurodollar
futures rates indicate that market participants continue to expect a 1/4 percentage
point tightening at the upcoming FOMC meeting and perhaps a full percentage
point in total by year-end.
Over the first few weeks after the meeting, intermediate-term Treasury yields
drifted higher as incoming macroeconomic data and the Chairman's Humphrey-
Hawkins testimony solidified expectations of further policy tightening. More
recently, however, these rates have reversed that earlier rise. Notably, the
sharpest rate declines coincided with occasional equity market selloffs. On
balance, yields on coupon issues with maturities out to several years are now
down around 10 basis points since February 1, while ten- and thirty-year rates
are off more than 1/4 point--with the larger decline partly reflecting increased
focus on the prospect of a diminishing supply of longer-maturity issues.
Corporate bond rates, by contrast, have risen somewhat over the intermeeting
period.
The hottest story, however, has been the behavior of the stock market. Taken as
a whole--gauged by the broad Wilshire 5000 index--the market has fluctuated
erratically in a generally sideways channel. At its close on March 14, the index
was essentially unchanged from where it was on February 2. This in itself might
seem remarkable, given the Fed's four tightening actions and warnings of more
to come if the market advance does not subside. But beyond that, there have
also been dramatically divergent share price movements across various sectors.
Shares of biotechnology, telecommunications, and computer-related technology
companies have surged, despite their already breathtaking valuations,
contributing to a 16 percent gain in the Nasdaq composite and a 14 percent gain
in the small-cap Russell 2000 since the last FOMC meeting. In contrast, stock
prices in the "old economy" financial and consumer goods and services sectors
have been under downward pressure over much of the intermeeting period,
helping to drag the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 11 percent.
Impact of Prospective Reductions in the Supply of Treasury Debt
The drop in longer-term Treasury yields over the intermeeting period extended a
decline that began in mid-January, which seems to have been largely influenced
by concern about the prospective shrinkage in the supply of Treasury securities.
The triggering events were several: The Treasury announced the final rules of its
debt buyback program, the CBO and OMB issued projections of larger budget

surpluses, and the Treasury outlined numerous cutbacks to its debt issuance
(chart).
At the benchmark ten-year and, especially, thirty-year maturities, the market
reactions have been striking. The thought that the thirty-year bond might
disappear entirely caused its yield to fall more than 1/2 percentage point from
mid-January to early February, even while short-term Treasury yields were
rising. More generally, liquidity in the coupon sector deteriorated noticeably and
the February midquarter refunding auctions were very poorly received.
Liquidity has since improved; moreover, the recent fallback by shorter-term
yields has reversed some of the earlier yield curve inversion. Currently, the
thirty-year yield stands 37 basis points below the two-year yield.
Downward pressure on the longer-end of the Treasury yield curve has been only
partially reflected in fixed-income markets. Yield spreads on agency, swap, and
corporate securities over Treasuries (chart) thus have widened considerably, but
there is little evidence to suggest that increased concern about credit risk has
played a significant role.
Equity Market
Stock prices have been influenced in recent months by massive funds flows
toward shares of high-tech companies partly at the expense of "old" economy
companies. The frenzy to invest in stocks with outsized return potential has
been evidenced by the enormous flows into aggressive growth mutual funds.
Total net inflows into equity funds ran at a record $40 billion pace in January
and appear to have been even larger in February. Inflows into aggressive growth
funds accounted for a whopping $17 billion in January and $21 billion in
February--a 3 percent average monthly growth rate for this subgroup. This
compares with a $1 billion monthly pace over the first three quarters of 1999.
Similarly, flows into sector funds have exceeded $11 billion per month in
January and February--a 5 percent monthly pace; high-tech funds are thought to
have accounted for most of this growth. Meanwhile, outflows from the more
conservative total return equity funds accelerated to $15 billion in February.
Hybrid and bond funds also continue to hemorrhage.
Another trend that reflects an apparent shift in risk tolerance is the recent jump
in trading of "penny stocks"--tiny stocks listed on the NASD Bulletin Board.
The average number of such shares changing hands daily has quadrupled from
around 250 million last summer and early autumn--which was already quite high
by historical standards--to more than 1 billion shares in February.
Certainly, fundamentals deserve some of the credit for the long-running
divergence between prices for technology and all other shares. That divergence
has been paralleled by a gap in expected, as well as actual, earnings growth

between technology and non-technology firms. Security analysts' forecasts of
long-term earnings growth rates for the computer-related technology sector of
the S&P 500--now above 20 percent--have been rising dramatically since 1995.
Similarly, long-term growth forecasts for the S&P 500 telecom sector have
moved significantly higher over the past few years and currently are at
15 percent per annum. In contrast, average growth expectations for the
remainder of the S&P 500, although not low, have not risen over the past two
years.
On the other hand, fourth-quarter earnings reports do not appear to have been a
catalyst for this diverging stock price performance. S&P 500 firms handily beat
expectations in most sectors; overall, earnings per share grew around 22 percent
from somewhat depressed levels four quarters ago, with petroleum, basic
materials, and the financial sectors logging the largest gains. Even relatively
small, non-S&P 500, firms appear to have registered solid double-digit earnings
growth. For the current quarter, analysts are forecasting some moderation in the
four-quarter earnings per share growth rate of the S&P 500 to somewhere in the
mid-teens.
These crosscurrents have resulted in a possibly unprecedented divergence
between valuations for the computer technology sector and valuations for other
firms, even among the relatively mature companies belonging to the S&P 500.
Between the early 1980s (when our data begin) and 1997, the price-earnings
ratios (PEs) for these two groups of firms have deviated little (chart). However,
since early 1998, the forward PE for the S&P 500 technology sector has shot up
to 55 while the PE for other S&P 500 firms has slipped below 19.
Business Finance
In response to the enormous demand for technology stocks, high-tech firms
issued new shares at a furious pace in February, resulting in a large jump in
overall nonfinancial public equity offerings. Seasoned offerings raised a record
$14 billion, as several high-flying technology firms that debuted as IPOs in 1999
returned to the market with follow-on offerings. IPOs by wireless, telecom,
biotech, and business-to-business Internet companies continued to be red hot,
and, although the reception of web-retailers cooled recently, 100 percent first-
day gains remain the norm. High-tech firms have accounted for 75 percent of
IPOs so far this year and figure prominently in the pipeline of forthcoming IPOs,
which swelled after new filings rose sharply in February and early March. The
pipeline is likely to remain well stocked, as venture capitalists invested a record
$48 billion in private firms during 1999, more than double the record $20 billion
they invested in 1998.
On the other hand, equity retirements, which these days are relatively more
prominent in non-technology sectors, continued their heavy pace. Announced

share repurchases have rebounded sharply so far this quarter, as lower stock
prices and ample free cash flow among blue-chips, such as Merck and General
Motors, have motivated the announcement of huge equity buyback programs.
Merger announcements continue at a brisk clip, and, while stock-swaps account
for a growing percentage of deal financing, the level of cash financing still is
expected to remain near recent highs.
Nonfinancial corporations tapped the credit markets in volume in February,
extending the rebound in borrowing after the year-end lull. Gross bond issuance
resumed at a strong pace as large borrowers, predominantly driven by telecom
investments and acquisition financing, shrugged off rate volatility to come to the
market. Reluctant investors were wooed with attractive pricing, liquidity, and--
in some cases--equity features. The preference for large, liquid issues remains
particularly marked, and almost 90 percent of total proceeds were raised in
issues sized at $250 million or greater (chart). The issuance totals in the high-
yield sector reflect a significant amount of convertible bonds issued by
technology firms. Most of these firms are recent IPOs that face enthusiastic
demand for the equity aspect of their issues. Smaller non-technology issuers
have found the bond markets less receptive, and anecdotal reports suggest that
these firms have turned to banks as well as private lenders that acquire
subordinated debt.
Corporate bond yields followed Treasuries lower early in February but reversed
course more recently amid the heavy issuance, resulting in a notable widening of
spreads. The limited role of credit concerns in the spread widening is indicated
by the fact that the gap between AAA and BBB corporate yields has widened
only a little since early February.
Nonfinancial commercial paper issuance and C&I bank loans both expanded at a
fairly robust pace in February, as they did toward the end of January. Some of
the commercial paper increase was related to merger financing and appears to
have reversed a bit in early March. The latest NFIB survey of small businesses
shows only a slight deterioration from the widespread perception of relatively
ample access to credit. According to the February Survey of Terms of Bank
Lending, loan spreads, while ticking down, have remained somewhat elevated,
as they have since the financial turmoil of the fall of 1998 and consistent with
loan officer reports indicating that they continue to hold the firmer lending
stance adopted in that period.
Most corporations remain in a strong financial position, but there are signs of a
continued modest deterioration at the edges. Moody's actions in January
resulted in little net change in overall credit ratings, and about equal amounts of
debt remain on watch for possible downgrades and upgrades. The ratio of the
liabilities of failed businesses to the total liabilities of nonfinancial firms ticked

up in both January and February, and the junk-bond default rate for U.S.
companies remained at about 5 percent, the highest level since the early 1990s.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Primary commercial mortgage interest rates fell almost 1/4 percentage point in
February, leaving them just above their November level. Yields on AAA-rated
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have fallen only slightly.
CMBS issuance was slow in the first two months of the year, though the current
calendar of deals points to a sizable pickup in coming weeks. About 40 percent
of the CMBS issued thus far this year have been floating rate, an unusually high
share. With the rise in interest rates over the past year, borrowers have found
floating-rate loans more attractive because, in addition to having lower current
rates, they typically carry fewer prepayment restrictions than fixed-rate
mortgages.
Newly available data indicate that commercial mortgage lending remained
robust in the fourth quarter. The outstanding amount of loans increased more
than 13 percent over 1999, paced by double-digit loan growth at all major
holders except life insurance companies.
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by life insurance companies
and banks edged down in the fourth quarter, and both series are at record lows.
Household Finance
With the market value of equity having been roughly flat over the year to date,
the ratio of household assets to disposable personal income is expected to have
remained close to the record level reached in the fourth quarter.
Apparently buoyed by high asset values and strong income growth, households
continue to take on debt at a rapid clip, despite the rise in mortgage and
consumer loan rates over the past year. Mortgage debt grew 8-3/4 percent at an
annual rate in the fourth quarter; this increase, while hefty, was actually down
some from the third quarter's 11-1/4 percent pace. We expect that mortgage
growth will remain strong in the current quarter, as the MBA purchase-loan
application index has stayed elevated. Boosted in part by brisk growth in auto
loans at captive finance companies, consumer credit grew at a 14-1/2 percent
annual rate in January after rising 8-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter. Moreover,
debt balances in margin accounts at brokers and dealers rose more than $20
billion in February. Since October, margin credit has shot up $83 billion, or
nearly 50 percent, outpacing the growth in aggregate equity market value over
the same period. With rapid debt growth and higher interest rates, the aggregate
household debt-service burden continued to rise, drawing a bit closer to the
levels reached in the mid-1980s.

Nonetheless, household credit quality appears to have changed little on net in
recent months. The rate of personal bankruptcy filings was up slightly in the
fourth quarter but is about 11 percent off the peak reached in the third quarter of
1998. Bank Call Reports indicate that delinquency rates on mortgages and
consumer credit edged down in the fourth quarter. Delinquencies on auto loans
at captive finance companies were about unchanged in the fourth quarter but
moved up somewhat in January. Moody's index of credit card delinquencies fell
further in January, reaching a four-year low.
Treasury Finance
At its mid-quarter refunding announcement on February 2, the Treasury
described a number of changes in its debt issuance to address its declining
borrowing needs. It will adopt a regular schedule of reopenings for its five-, ten-
and thirty-year securities, under which every other auction of each of those
securities will be a relatively smaller reopening. Because the thirty-year bond is
issued on a semiannual basis, this change implies that only one new security will
be offered each year.
The Treasury stated that the two-year note would continue to be auctioned
monthly, but the issue size of that security was cut at the February auction from
$14 billion to $12 billion. In addition, the Treasury eliminated the April auction
of the thirty-year inflation-indexed bond and indicated that the size of the ten-
year inflation-indexed note would be modestly reduced. On net in the first
quarter, the Treasury is expected to pay down about $39 billion in Treasury
coupon securities.
In the bill sector, the Treasury announced that the year bill would no longer be
issued every fourth week (after March 2), but would instead be issued only four
times a year (beginning June 1). This change was intended to permit the size of
its weekly auctions of three- and six-month bills to increase--most recently to
$17 billion.
Uncertainty about the implications of these announcements may have limited
participation at the midquarter refunding auctions in February. Bid-to-cover
ratios were well below historical averages, and stop-out yields were unusually
far above the when-issued rates prevailing just before the auction. More
recently, the auction of the two-year note was well received.
Last week, the Treasury completed its first debt buyback under its recently
established program, repurchasing $1 billion par value of outstanding bonds
with remaining maturities of about fifteen to nineteen years and a total market
value of $1.35 billion. The buyback operation was well received: Primary
dealers submitted offers to sell more than $8-1/2 billion of the thirteen eligible

III-14
securities back to the Treasury, and the prices that the Treasury accepted were
near those observed in the secondary market.
Agency Finance
Spreads between the yields on longer-term benchmark agency securities and
those on Treasury securities have widened considerably since mid-January,
primarily owing to the unusual developments in the Treasury market. Currently,
spreads on five-year securities are up about 15 basis points from their mid-
January level to 60 basis points, and spreads on the ten- and thirty-year securities
are up between 30 and 35 basis points, to about 90 and 100 basis points
respectively.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to issue Reference and Benchmark
securities at a strong pace over the intermeeting period. As expected under their
announced issuance calendars, Fannie Mae auctioned $3 billion of five-year and
$4 billion of seven-year Benchmark notes, and Freddie Mac auctioned $5 billion
of three-year Reference notes. In addition, Fannie Mae opportunistically
responded to the scaling back of Treasury bond issuance by conducting an
unscheduled auction of $2.5 billion of a thirty-year Benchmark bond and
announcing that it would issue thirty-year bonds four times this year rather than
two.
Concurrent with that auction, Fannie Mae offered its third debt exchange
program, under which investors could exchange previously issued medium-term
notes with maturities between twenty-five and twenty-nine years for the newly
auctioned Benchmark bond. Under the exchange rates set, investors had to give
up about 5 to 7 basis points on the yields of most eligible securities to obtain the
more liquid new bond. Investors exchanged nearly two-thirds of the total
amount of securities that were eligible for the program, increasing the issue size
of the new bond to $4.7 billion.
In total, more than $200 billion in Benchmark and Reference notes and bonds
have been issued to date. In addition to those securities, Fannie and Freddie are
currently issuing more than $10 billion of Benchmark and Reference bills each
week.
In a development that could further enhance the liquidity of Benchmark and
Reference notes, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange are introducing this month futures contracts based on five- and ten-
year benchmark and reference notes and options based on these new futures
contracts. The specifications of the contracts are similar to those already
available on the five- and ten-year Treasury notes from the CBOT.

III-15
Municipal Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds averaged about $10 billion per
month in January and February, about half the pace of the past two years.
Rising interest rates have choked off nearly all refunding issuance. New capital
issuance is also down, as rising rates and increasing tax revenue appear to have
limited the demand for new funds.
Although the municipal yield curve flattened somewhat, long-term yields did not
follow Treasuries down entirely, and the ratio of the thirty-year revenue bond
yield to the thirty-year Treasury yield backed up to above 1.
The credit quality of municipal issuers remains strong, despite a slight net
downgrade of issues by Standard and Poor's in February. The downgrades
owed to the downgrading of a credit enhancement provider rather than to a
decline in issuer financial strength.1 Also of note, Fitch upgraded its rating for
California, bringing $22 billion of debt up to the AA- level, the rating already
applied by Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates slowed substantially in February
owing largely to the unwinding of Y2K effects. M2 decelerated to a 2-1/4
percent annual growth rate, down from a 6 percent rate in January. Y2K-related
bulges in currency and money funds unwound in February, while liquid deposits
got a boost from currency reflows. Abstracting from these effects and the
impact of larger-than-usual income tax refunds, M2 growth over the first two
months of the year was below its pace over the second half of 1999. Shifts into
credit market instruments and equities as interest rates rose and stock prices
soared probably dampened underlying M2 growth.
M3 rose at a 4 percent rate in February, held down by a 11-1/2 percent decline in
institution-only money market mutual funds. This retreat reflected the
unwinding of Y2K effects plus the typical restraining effects of monetary policy
tightening. (These funds often decline temporarily when interest rates rise
because their yields lag changes in market rates a bit.) By contrast, large time
deposits increased at a robust 17 percent rate. The extraordinary buildup in
these deposits at the end of last year has not unwound, reflecting in part the
continued growth in bank credit.
1. The CD ratings of Bank One Corp. and its subsidiaries were downgraded to 'A+/A-1'
from 'AA-/A-1+' by S&P. This triggered downgrades of more than fifty small bond issues--the
vast majority under $25 million in face value-for which Bank One and a subsidiary had
provided letters of credit.

III-20
Bank credit grew at a 5-1/2 percent annual rate in February, up only mildly from
January's sluggish pace. Growth in both months was held down by declines in
security loans and banks' holdings of securities, volatile components that had
grown rapidly at the end of last year. Commercial and industrial loans increased
at a 15-1/2 percent rate in February after rising 2-1/2 percent in January; the
weekly data actually show steady increases since mid-January, following the
slump in growth around year-end. Real estate loans have also expanded rapidly
so far this year, bolstered by continued strong growth in commercial real estate
lending. Growth of home mortgages at banks has slowed a bit, perhaps owing,
in part, to a relatively heavy backlog of securitizations delayed until after the
turn of the year. Growth of consumer loans on bank balance sheets grew at a
12-1/4 percent pace last month, but adjusted for securitizations, growth slipped
to 7 percent.
The robust growth in bank loans reflects strong demand for credit, but banks'
willingness to meet that demand is surely buoyed by their continued profitability
and strong balance sheets, evidenced in fourth-quarter Call Report data. Return
on equity remained high even by the elevated standards of recent years. Loan-
loss rates stayed low, with a decline in charge-off rates on consumer loans about
offsetting a rise in loss rates on C&I loans. Delinquency rates declined for all
major loan types.

Trade in Goods and Services
In December, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $25.5 billion, $1.6
billion smaller than in November (revised). The deficit in the fourth quarter was
$19 billion (s.a.a.r.) larger than in the third quarter. Despite the increase in the
nominal deficit, real net exports made a smaller negative contribution to U.S.
GDP growth in the fourth quarter than in the previous three quarters; a small
slowdown in real export growth was exceeded by a larger slowdown in the
growth of real imports.

The value of exports jumped in December, led by increases in aircraft,
machinery, automotive products and consumer goods. Growth of exports in the
fourth quarter was only slightly slower than in the third quarter. About
45 percent of the rise in value was concentrated in industrial supplies (especially
chemicals). The remaining increase was spread among all other major trade
categories except agricultural products, which declined. Real exports of goods
and services rose 9 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Over the four
quarters of 1999, real exports rose 4-1/2 percent, with nearly all export growth
occurring in the second half of the year. By area, most of the increase in exports
went to Mexico and Canada.
The value of imports rose 1 percent in December, somewhat less rapidly than in
October and November, with increases spread over most major trade categories.
Growth of imports was strong in the fourth quarter, but it did not match the pace
set in the previous two quarters. There were robust increases in all major trade
categories with the exception of automotive products (where the value was only
slightly above the very high level reached in the third quarter). Real imports of
goods and services rose 10 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter

compared with rates of about 15 percent in both the second and third quarters
and 13 percent in the first quarter. Over the four quarters of 1999, real imports
rose 13 percent reflecting the strength of U.S. economic activity.
Trade data for January will be released on March 21, the day of the FOMC
meeting.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods.
Oil. The run up in the price of imported oil (BLS) slowed a bit in January
relative to that in the prior six months. Nonetheless, the 12-month change in
price was 132 percent, reflecting strengthening world demand and constrained
world supply (primarily a result of production restraints by OPEC and other
important producers). Since January, spot oil prices have moved up sharply as
apparent dissent within OPEC has increased uncertainty over the outcome of the
cartel's March 27 meeting. Temporary supply disruptions in Nigeria and the
North Sea have further exacerbated tight oil market conditions. In February, the
average spot price of West Texas Intermediate rose over two dollars to $29.40
per barrel. Spot WTI is currently trading above $31 per barrel, after peaking at
over $34 per barrel on March 7.
Non-oil imports and exports. Prices of non-oil imported goods declined slightly
in January after showing no change in December. Prices of imported industrial
supplies rose marginally in January, the second month of very small changes
after five months of hefty price increases. There were small price declines in
most other major trade categories. The one exception was imported food and
beverages where prices dropped sharply following two months of strong
increases. The turnaround was due primarily to a drop in prices for imported
coffee and vegetables. The price index for non-oil imports, as well as that for
imported core goods (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors), was
the same in January as the average for the fourth quarter of last year.
Prices of total exported goods were unchanged in January for the second
consecutive month. Prices of agricultural exports were unchanged following
declines in six of the past seven months. Prices of exported core goods (which
exclude computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products) rose 0.2 percent
in January reflecting a moderate increase in the price of industrial supplies and
no change in prices of other major categories. Prices of computers and
semiconductors declined slightly. The index for prices of nonagricultural
exports in January was marginally higher than the average for the fourth quarter
of last year.

IV-6
U.S. Current Account
Data for U.S. international transactions in the fourth quarter of 1999 were
released today. The current account deficit rose to $399 billion at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1999, an increase of $43 billion over
the third quarter. About one-fourth of the rise in the deficit was accounted for by
a larger deficit for goods and services; an even larger fraction, nearly half, arose
from an increase in net investment income payments. Other net income and
unilateral transfers jumped $11 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter,
largely because of year-end government grants to Israel. The current account
deficit for the year was $339 billion compared with $221 billion in 1998. A
more complete description of these developments and the underlying data will
appear in the Greenbook supplement.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private-sector demand for U.S. securities slowed in December, but then
picked up in January to match again the record pace of last year. (See line 4 of
the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) The recent pattern of
weak demand for Treasury securities, offset by strong net purchases of other
securities, continued in December and January. Compared to most of last year,
foreign purchases of agency debt also appeared relatively weak in December and
January. This effect may owe to the recent initiation of agency benchmark bills
programs. Agency bills are currently included in a catch-all category in the TIC
banking data; thus, foreign demand for agency debt may not have slowed as
much as line 4.b would indicate. January's net purchases of U.S. stocks and
corporate bonds were fairly concentrated, with most of the purchases of bonds
coming from the United Kingdom, and an unusually large portion of the
purchases of stocks coming from Germany. For 1999 as a whole, net foreign
purchases of agency bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate stocks all surpassed
previous record annual levels. In contrast, last year was the first year since 1990
in which private-sector foreigners sold Treasuries on net.
U.S. residents sold a modest amount of foreign stocks in January (line 5),
following modest net purchases in December. The geographical pattern changed
somewhat in January: net sales through Europe continued, but the strong net
purchases seen earlier through Japan ceased. U.S. residents made small net
purchases of foreign bonds in January, mostly through Europe and, notably,
Mexico. For 1999 as a whole, taking into account an estimated $110 billion in
foreign stocks that U.S. investors acquired through stock swaps (included in line
9), net U.S. purchases of foreign securities were at about the same level as in the
previous few years.

IV-7
Foreign official assets held in the United States fell slightly in January after a
huge increase in December (line 1). Argentina, fully reversing a sizable increase
for December, more than accounted for the decrease in January. In December,
sizable increases were also recorded for Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea. For
1999 as a whole, foreign official assets in the United States increased $46
billion, compared to a decrease of $17 billion in 1998. The increase in 1999 was
largely accounted for by Japan ($45 billion), as the result of its foreign exchange
intervention operations. OPEC members' assets in the United States increased
only slightly in 1999, despite a significant increase in oil revenues. Reserves of
other non-G-10 countries (line 1c) generally fell for the second consecutive year,
although Korea, Hong Kong, China, and India recorded significant increases.
Preliminary data from the FRBNY suggest that foreign official assets held in the
United States changed little in February.
Monthly net capital flows through banks (line 3) remain large and volatile.
Banks recorded net outflows of nearly $50 billion in December as both domestic
and foreign chartered banks in the United States reduced their net liabilities to
foreign affiliates. December's outflow reversed a similar-sized net inflow
recorded in November. In January, however, banks again recorded large net
inflows. While monthly bank flows are often volatile, we attribute the
exceptionally large offsetting flows in the November-January period as being at
least partially attributable to repositioning over the century date change.
For 1999 as a whole, net inflows through banks slowed to less than $6 billion,
compared to $57 billion in 1998. Although this slowing could be swamped by a
single month's data, it is consistent with other developments in the capital
account over the year. The significant pickup in inflows through direct
investment and securities transactions, together with the swing to large official
inflows, imply that less of the U.S. current account deficit needed to be financed
through private bank transactions.
The data for the fourth quarter of 1999 that were released today will provide our
first look at direct investment capital flows in the fourth quarter. These data, and
the statistical discrepancy, will be included in the Greenbook supplement.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the February FOMC meeting, the nominal exchange value of the dollar
has appreciated 0.4 percent, on balance, in terms of the major currencies index.
The dollar depreciated 2.1 percent against the yen, but appreciated 2.8 against
the British pound, 0.6 percent against the euro, and 1.5 percent against the
Canadian dollar. The index of the dollar's value relative to the currencies of
other important trading partners slipped 1.0 percent in the intermeeting period.
The major contributor to the decline was a 2.6 percent depreciation of the dollar
against the Mexican peso, but depreciations of 3.0 percent and 3.2 percent versus
the Brazilian real and new Taiwan dollar, respectively, added to the fall.

December January February March
The yen, whose exchange value had weakened to a level of 111 per dollar in
mid-February after warnings that Japanese fourth quarter GDP growth was
probably negative, appreciated almost 3 percent on March 1. On March 8, when
the yen hit a level of 106 per dollar, Japanese monetary authorities intervened to
weaken the yen, purchasing both dollars and euros. The intervention had a
limited effect on impact, which quickly dissipated. The yen appreciated still
further following the March 13 release of preliminary estimates of Japan's fourth
quarter GDP, which showed strong non-residential investment growth despite an
overall contraction of 5.5 percent (s.a.a.r.). The Bank of Japan intervened once
more on March 15, again having only limited effect, despite an even larger
purchase of dollars.

IV-10
On February 28, the overnight call money rate in Japan rose as high as 55 basis
points--reflecting anticipation of Leap-Day computer glitches--despite provision
by the Bank of Japan of 9.8 trillion in excess reserves. The following day, the
Bank of Japan injected ¥11.4 trillion of excess liquidity, and the rate returned to
a level of two basis points.
The exchange value of the euro was quite volatile within the intermeeting
period, rising above parity for two days in mid-February, only to hit a new low
of $0.939 in intra-day trading one week later. The volatility was especially
pronounced in the yen/euro cross rate, covering a range of more than ten yen
within the intermeeting period. The euro appreciated in mid-February on
hawkish statements by ESCB officials, but later dramatically reversed itself after
the release of strong fourth quarter GDP growth in the United States.

Since the last FOMC meeting, ten-year government bond yields have risen
modestly in Japan, but have fallen 12 to 14 basis points in continental Europe
and more than 30 basis points in both Canada and the United Kingdom. In
Canada, data releases showing that prices are rising at rates near the bottom of
the Bank of Canada's inflation target band dampened market participants' earlier
expectations for the Bank of Canada to match all the policy moves anticipated in
the United States this year. Similarly, comments by members of the Bank of

IV-11
England's Monetary Policy Committee characterizing the pound as both
overvalued and as helping to suppress inflation, along with signs that previous
policy moves have begun to slow the British economy, have led to a downward
revision in the amount of policy tightening expected in the United Kingdom.
Since the start of February, continental European equity prices have surged, led
by telecommunication stocks. Share prices are up 15 percent in Italy, 10 percent
in Germany and 8 percent in France. In contrast, stock prices are down more
than 5 percent over the same period in the United Kingdom and on the TOPIX
index in Japan.

Several developments in emerging markets led to a substantial decline in
stripped spreads over U.S. Treasuries of sovereign bond yields of developing
countries. On February 3, Moody's Investor Service placed Mexico's sovereign
foreign currency credit rating on review for possible upgrade, which
materialized on March 7; the rating went from Bal to investment grade, Baa3.
Shortly thereafter, Standard & Poor's also raised its rating for Mexico, to one
notch below investment grade. In the intermeeting period, the sovereign spread
on Mexico's dollar-denominated foreign bonds fell about 200 basis points and
Mexican share prices gained more than 16 percent. Standard & Poor's revision
of the outlook for Brazil's foreign currency credit rating from stable to positive
had a similar effect on Brazil's sovereign spread, which shed 60 basis points
over the same period. The agreement of Russia and its London Club creditors to
exchange new senior Eurobonds for the defaulted debt of the former Soviet
Union helped to bring the spread on Russian debt down 18 percentage points.
Prior to the FOMC's decision on February 2, the Reserve Bank of Australia
raised its cash rate 50 basis points, and immediately following the U.S. move,
the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis points. The next day, the
European Central Bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority each raised
their respective policy rates 25 basis points, the Danish central bank raised its
two-week lending rate 30 basis points, and the Swiss National Bank moved its
target band for Swiss-franc LIBOR 50 basis points higher. On February 4, the
Swedish Riksbank hiked its repurchase rate 50 basis points. The Bank of
England increased its repurchase rate 25 basis points on February 10, the same
day the Bank of Korea raised its overnight call rate a similar amount. The
Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its cash rate 50 basis points on March 15.
The price of gold experienced wide gyrations over the intermeeting period.
Various announcements about hedging activity by gold producing companies
and speculation about the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings against a large
Ghanian gold producer caused the metal's price to shoot over $320 per troy
ounce in early February. As speculation subsided and other gold producers
announced that they would not change their hedging activity, the price of gold

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the January Greenbook suggest a further pickup in economic
activity in the foreign industrial countries in the first quarter. Indicators for
Canada and the major European countries point to a continuation of the solid
gains posted in the second half of last year. In Japan, the economy is showing
signs of expansion, following an unexpectedly sharp decline in real GDP in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
Headline measures of twelve-month inflation have crept up in some foreign
industrial countries in response to higher energy prices, but core consumer price
inflation generally remains low. The euro-area harmonized CPI inflation rate
rose in January to the European Central Bank's target of 2 percent, but excluding
energy prices, inflation was only 1 percent. U.K. inflation has actually declined
over the past year and was 2.1 percent in January, below the Bank of England's
2.5 percent target. Canadian core inflation was 1.6 in February, below the center
of the Bank of Canada's inflation target range. To contain inflationary
pressures, the central banks in each of these regions raised their key policy
interest rates 25 basis points in early February. Japan's consumer prices, on the
other hand, have stabilized over the first two months of 2000, but have
continued to decline on a year-over-year basis.
In Japan, indicators pointed to improvement in the second half of 1999,
although preliminary estimates of Japanese GDP indicate a decline in economic
activity of nearly 5 percent. While industrial production rose by more than
3 percent in the second half of 1999 from year-earlier levels, and capacity
utilization and the inventory-to-shipments ratio also pointed toward expansion,
these data track activity in sectors that comprise only a relatively small fraction
of GDP. For example, the headline-grabbing index of industrial production
consists of the mining and manufacturing sectors, which account for 24 percent
of GDP (down from 35 percent in 1960), while services such as wholesale and
retail trade, finance and insurance, real estate, and transportation and
communications make up well over one-half of GDP (up from about one-third in
1960). Other indicators such as real household expenditures and housing starts
predicted weakness in the second half of 1999.
Looking forward, however, indicators paint a brighter picture for real economic
activity. Housing starts in January were up 16 percent from the previous month
and new car registrations rose 12 percent. Increases in shipments of machinery
in January far exceeded expectations. Machinery orders were up 18.4 percent in
January from a year earlier. The January diffusion index of leading indicators

IV-14
came in at a preliminary 85.7 (on a scale of 100), its highest level since August
1994 and far above December's 50.0. January's rise in industrial production was
a resumption of the increases observed in the second half of 1999 after an
interruption in December. However, household spending fell 3 percent in
January from its level of a year earlier.
The Japanese labor market has remained steady recently. The unemployment
rate was unchanged at 4.7 percent in January, down from a record high of
4.9 percent in July. The offers-to-applicants ratio rose to 0.52 in January, up
from its record low of 0.46 in August. The most recent consumer behavior
survey (third-quarter) showed an improvement in attitudes toward job prospects,
although the overall consumer sentiment index was little changed.
Deflation continues in both goods and real estate prices. Core consumer goods
prices (excluding fresh food) in the Tokyo area were down 0.4 percent in
February from a year earlier. Wholesale prices for domestic goods were down
0.5 percent in January, following a drop of 1.5 percent in 1999 despite a sharp
increase in the price of oil. A survey of residential land prices showed a decline
of 7 percent in the year ending December 1 in the Tokyo and Osaka areas and a
6 percent decline in the Nagoya area.

Japan's merchandise trade surplus for 1999 was $108 billion at an annual rate,
little changed from 1998. Denominated in dollars, exports were up about
8 percent from their 1998 average, while imports were up about 11 percent,
partly reflecting a jump in the value of oil imports in the latter part of the year.
Exports to developing Asia surged last year, as recovery in these economies took
hold, but exports to Europe have declined significantly from 1998 levels. On a
national accounts basis, net exports contributed -0.4 percent to GDP growth in
1999. In January, Japan's seasonally adjusted current account surplus rose
sharply to $12 billion, from $7.2 billion in December.
In the euro area, the pace of real economic activity picked up considerably
during the second half of 1999. Real GDP rose a preliminary 3.8 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter after a 4.1 percent surge in the previous quarter,
resulting in a 2.2 percent growth rate in 1999. In the final quarter of last year, all
GDP components rose, with both domestic demand and net exports contributing
positively to economic growth.

IV-16
Incoming data for the current quarter suggest that economic activity remains
strong. German industrial production rose 1/2 percent (s.a.) in January, after
falling 1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. The overall economic sentiment
index in the euro area rose again in February after hitting a ten-year high in
January and showing consistent gains during most of 1999. Confidence
improved in the industrial sector and among consumers. Confidence declined
somewhat in the construction sector, but remained above its fourth quarter and
December levels.
Harmonized twelve-month CPI inflation rose again in January to hit the
2 percent target ceiling set by the European Central Bank (ECB). Excluding
energy prices, however, the inflation rate was only 1 percent. Noticeable
differences still exist across individual countries, with harmonized inflation rates
in Germany, Austria, and France (around 1-1/2 percent) considerably below the
rate prevailing in Ireland (about 4 1/2 percent).

On February 3, the Governing Council of the ECB raised its official refinancing
rate by 25 basis points to 3-1/4 percent. Interest rates on the marginal lending and
deposit facilities were also increased by 25 basis points, to 4-1/4 percent and
2-1/4 percent, respectively. ECB President Duisenberg said that the decision
reflected greater risks to price stability due to the recent depreciation of the euro
and generous liquidity associated with relatively rapid money supply growth.
The Governing Council of the ECB had last changed its official rates on
November 4, 1999, when they were raised by 50 basis points each.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 3.1 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth
quarter of last year. Total domestic demand grew a rapid 7.2 percent, as
investment and consumption expenditures registered strong gains and inventory
accumulation made a large positive contribution to growth. Strength in domestic
demand was partially offset by a large negative contribution from net exports, as
import growth remained robust but exports declined.
Incoming data for the current quarter suggest that economic activity remains
strong in the United Kingdom. Although industrial production edged down in
January, it was partially explained by Y2K-related precautionary shutdowns.
Manufacturing surveys indicate expansion in February, even with weak export
orders. Service sector surveys indicate that activity continued at a brisk pace
through February. The volume of retail sales increased 1.5 percent in January to
a level 4 percent above its fourth-quarter average, although heavy price
discounting may have contributed to the unusually large volume of sales.
Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate remained 4.0 percent in February, the lowest rate in 20 years, and the labor
force survey measure of the unemployment rate remained at a record-low
5.9 percent for the three months centered in December. Average annual earnings
growth rose further to 6.4 percent in January, in part reflecting year-end bonuses.
This rate is well above the level of 4.5 percent that the Bank of England has
suggested is compatible with its inflation target.

Producer input prices have risen sharply in recent months, in part reflecting
higher oil prices. However, the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation
(excluding mortgage interest rates) remains below the 2-1/2 percent target, in large
part reflecting the continued strength of sterling relative to the euro. After
raising the official repo rate a further 25 basis points in February, the Bank of
England's Monetary Policy Committee left the repo rate unchanged in March.
Real GDP in Canada continued to expand rapidly, rising 4.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in
the fourth quarter. Domestic demand rose sharply in the fourth quarter, as
business and inventory investment surged and consumer spending continued to
post solid gains. The fast pace of domestic demand growth caused imports to
rise a hefty 21 percent. This was only partially offset by 7 percent rise in
exports, causing net exports to subtract 4.7 percentage points from growth.
Partly reflecting improved job opportunities, consumer confidence rose
5 percent in the fourth quarter. Also, business confidence surged in the fourth
quarter, as firms became increasingly optimistic about future profitability and
the ability to undertake investment activities. Economic indicators for the
current quarter suggest that activity remains strong. Employment continued to
rise in the first quarter, posting gains in January and February after a sizeable
0.9 percent increase (s.a.) in the fourth quarter. The unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 6.8 percent in February (s.a.), as labor force participation
rose to 65.8 percent, its highest level since June of 1992.
Despite the strong pace of economic activity, core CPI inflation (which excludes
food and energy prices) remains low. In February, core prices were up only 1.6
percent on a twelve-month basis. The Canadian dollar's appreciation has helped
contain price pressures in recent months, but headline inflation has increased,
reflecting higher oil prices.
Following the 25 basis point increase in the U.S. federal funds rate, the Bank of
Canada raised its Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent on February 3.
The Bank cited "the strong momentum of demand in the Canadian economy
from both external and domestic sources, the importance of approaching the
economy's full capacity in a prudent way, and the risk of a spillover of potential
inflation pressures from the United States into Canada" as important factors
behind this decision.
In delivering Canada's FY2000-01 federal budget on February 28, Finance
Minister Paul Martin proposed a larger-than-expected C$58 billion ($40 billion)
in tax cuts to take place over the next five years. Tax cutting initiatives include
the immediate restoration of full indexation of personal income taxes for
inflation, an additional lowering of personal income tax rates, particularly for

IV-21
middle and lower income families, and reductions in both corporate tax rates and
the capital gains tax rate. Mr. Martin also announced nearly C$17 billion
($12 billion) in new spending initiatives over the next four years and devoted
another C$15 billion over the next five years to debt reduction (this represents
2.5 percent of the total outstanding net federal debt).

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In Latin America, output rose at an uneven pace across countries. In Mexico, the
evidence suggests that activity has remained strong this year. Growth increased
in Brazil late last year, but recent data give an unclear picture as to whether this
strengthening has carried over to 2000. The Argentine recovery has yet to gain
momentum, and the Venezuelan economy continues to flounder, with only a hint
of an improvement. Notwithstanding Mexican export strength, a pickup in
domestic demand has led to a widening of the country's external deficits. In the
rest of Latin America, exports have also generally been expanding and have led
to a strengthening of external balances. Inflation remains in control with a
decline in inflation rates in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, and slight deflation
in Argentina.
In developing Asia, the economic expansion has been more widespread and
sustained, in part reflecting the global boom in the electronics industry. Korea
and China continue to grow at a robust pace, while growth has accelerated in
Taiwan and Hong Kong. The ASEAN countries generally registered strong
growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Rapid growth has fueled imports,
leading to a narrowing of external balances in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China's trade surplus is also down, although special factors might account for
some of this decline. Inflation in developing Asia remains well-contained,
despite the recovery and the runup in oil prices.
Brazil grew rapidly during the fourth quarter of 1999, with real GDP up
5.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the previous quarter. A surge in real exports and a fall
in imports contributed significantly to the fourth quarter growth. Industrial
production was essentially unchanged (s.a.) in January, but, boosted by strong
exports, the trade surplus for the three-month period ending in February 2000
was $4 billion, versus a $2 billion deficit over the corresponding period a year
ago. The improvement in the trade balance contributed heavily to a narrowing in
the current account deficit. Inflation news has been good, with consumer price
inflation declining in February.
The central bank's monetary policy committee left its target for the overnight
interest rate unchanged at 19 percent at its mid-February meeting; this rate has
not been altered since September 1999. The central bank has been concerned
about potential inflationary pressures stemming from increases in oil prices and
from scheduled future increases in government-controlled utilities prices. In late
February, the Brazilian government postponed its planned deregulation of
petroleum prices until early 2001 in response to oil price rises. Brazil met its
fiscal and other targets for the fourth quarter of last year under its IMF program,
but its primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP was boosted by temporary measures.

In Mexico, growth slowed in the fourth quarter of last year to 2.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.), partly pulled down by a surge in imports. However, industrial
production rose 2.3 percent (s.a.) in January, signaling that economic activity
remains strong. In addition, data on retail sales indicate a pickup in
consumption spending beginning in the fourth quarter of last year. The strength
of the economy is producing a widening of external imbalances; the trade deficit
and the current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 1999 increased to nearly
$7 billion (s.a.a.r.) and $18 billion (a.r.), respectively, compared with averages
of roughly $5 billion and $13 billion over the previous three quarters. The
widening of external deficits has been tempered by the continued strength of
Mexican exports, resulting primarily from a booming U.S. economy. Inflation
continues on a downward trend, with consumer prices less than 11 percent
higher in February over a year earlier, about two percentage points lower than
the comparable rate in December.
Mexican financial markets received a boost on March 7, when Moody's
upgraded its rating of Mexico's long-term foreign currency debt to Baa3 from
Bal, bringing the securities up to investment grade. Although the move was
largely anticipated, market prices rallied on the news, as it opened the door for
many institutional investors-previously constrained from investing in Mexico-to
put money in that country's securities. Moody's cited a lower foreign currency
debt burden, a dynamic export sector, large inflows of foreign direct investment
in recent years, and the effectiveness of the country's flexible exchange rate

IV-27
regime as the reasons behind the upgrade. Less than a week later, Standard and
Poor's followed suit, raising its rating on Mexican foreign currency debt to BB+
from BB, but still leaving Mexico one notch shy of investment grade. Besides
citing reasons that echoed those of Moody's, S&P also expressed the belief that
the banking sector may be poised to recover. It appeared to base this view partly
on the expectation of increased foreign participation in the banking sector, as
evidenced by last week's merger of the Mexican unit of the Spanish giant,
BBVA, with Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank.

In Argentina, data released since the last Greenbook generally suggest that the
recovery is continuing but has not yet gained momentum. Industrial production
rose 1.1 percent (s.a.) in January, a bit off from the fourth quarter pace. In
January, the trade balance swung to a $4.8 billion (s.a.a.r.) surplus, boosted by
growth in exports and a sizable decline in imports. Consumer prices continue to
fall, albeit at a slower rate; the latest price data for February show a slight
month-over-month decline and a drop of 1.3 percent from the year-earlier level.
Argentina and the IMF signed a three-year stand-by loan arrangement totaling
$7.2 billion on March 10. Anticipation of the IMF package and continued
progress on fiscal and other structural reforms had been met with enthusiasm by
market participants, leading Standard and Poor's to revise its outlook for

IV-28
Argentina from negative to stable in mid-February. Since the beginning of
February, the Argentine stock market has risen over 5 percent, and short-term
domestic interest rates and Brady spreads have dropped around 100 basis points.
Taking advantage of the positive market sentiment, the Argentine government
has made substantial progress toward meeting its borrowing needs for 2000,
completing over 40 percent of its planned external and internal debt issuance for
the year as of early March.

The sparse economic news from Venezuela since the last Greenbook provides
only modest hints of recovery. Automobile sales surged in January and February
compared with the very depressed levels in these months last year. Consumer
prices rose only 18 percent over the 12 months ended January-the smallest
annual growth rate since the mid-1980s-suggesting continued weakness in
domestic demand. In May, elections will be held for over 6,000 offices,
including the Presidency, as part of the new constitutional process. Political
uncertainty in anticipation of these sweeping elections continues to be a source
of anxiety for investors. Non-oil export industries are being crushed by the
appreciated real exchange rate, which some analysts believe may be overvalued
by 40 percent or more. On the other hand, the sustained runup in oil prices since
mid-1999 is generating a sizable current account surplus.

In Korea, recent data suggest that activity has continued to increase at a robust
pace. Industrial production rebounded strongly in January from a dip in the
previous month, led by rapid increases in the output of communications
equipment, computers, and automobiles. The unemployment rate eased slightly
further in January, to a level more than 3 percentage points below its peak level
reached early last year. Total employment was 6.1 percent above its year-earlier
level in January.
The trade surplus declined in December and January. For 1999 as a whole, it
was down by about one-third from its record level of the previous year. Total
exports grew by 9 percent in 1999, led by a 34 percent jump in exports of
electronic and electrical products; semiconductor exports were up 11 percent.
However, total imports grew even more strongly, increasing by 28 percent,
reflecting the rapid growth of domestic demand. Imports of capital goods were
particularly strong, rising nearly 40 percent in 1999.
On February 10, the central bank raised its target for the overnight rate by
25 basis points to 5 percent. According to Governor Chon of the Bank of Korea,
the rate hike was ". .. aimed at narrowing the wide spread between short- and
long-term interest rates [about 500 basis points] and thus normalizing the
country's interest rate curve." Governor Chon said that the rate hike was not

IV-30
prompted by any signs of inflationary pressure. The Bank of Korea had held its
target for the overnight rate at 4.75 percent since last April, despite the rapid
growth of activity over this period, citing the need to promote the restructuring
and stability of financial markets.

The ASEAN region registered a strong fourth quarter, following mixed
performance in the third quarter. Fueled by increased demand for electronics,
Malaysian GDP increased by over 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter as
well as from a year earlier. Indonesian GDP rebounded in the fourth quarter,
rising 7.8 percent after two quarters of negative growth, spurred largely by gains
in consumer spending that likely reflect an increase in confidence following the
October elections and an end to the conflict in East Timor. Singapore's GDP
grew by a more moderate 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter, while GDP in the
Philippines expanded only 2 percent.
Activity data for this quarter are limited. Singapore's production rebounded in
January after a weak fourth quarter. Malaysian production edged up slightly in
January, but Thai industrial output fell off in December and January after rapid
growth earlier last year.
During the fourth quarter, both exports and imports continued to increase
throughout most of the ASEAN region. Despite growing domestic demand, a
clear pattern of narrowing trade surpluses has yet to emerge. January trade data

IV-31
were mixed, with the trade surplus increasing in Indonesia and Thailand, but
dropping sharply in Singapore and Malaysia. Inflation remains muted across the
region.

In China, consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in February from their year-earlier
level, reflecting the impact of rising food and oil prices. This is the first
12-month increase since March 1998. China's trade surplus narrowed
significantly in January and February, although the trade data are likely distorted
by Y2K-related effects and the timing of Chinese New Year celebrations. In
March, the government pledged to continue to increase government spending
this year to boost the economy. The government also announced that it expects
real GDP to expand around 7 percent this year and average inflation to be close
to zero. On the trade front, a bill granting China permanent normal trading
relations with the United States was sent to Congress in March by the White
House. Congress is expected to vote on the bill before the end of the summer.

In Hong Kong, real GDP rose a blistering 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter
(s.a.a.r.), much faster than all expectations. The government attributed the
impressive performance to growing exports, driven by strong demand in Asia,
the United States, and the European Union, and to a rebound in currency values
across Asia that has improved Hong Kong's competitiveness. The upsurge in
growth prompted the government to raise its forecast for year-over-year growth
for 2000 from 4 percent to 5 percent. The unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent
(s.a.) in the November-January period, the lowest rate in over a year, although
still well above pre-crisis levels. Rapid growth of imports has widened the trade
deficit in recent months. Consumer prices showed a steep decline of 5.3 percent
in January from a year earlier, although prices were roughly flat on a seasonally
adjusted month-to-month basis. In March, the government revised downward
its estimate for the 1999/2000 budget deficit to just $200 million, from an
original estimate of $4.7 billion; this shift largely reflects realized capital gains
on fiscal reserves invested in the stock market.

In Taiwan, real GDP rose about 10 percent in the fourth quarter, led by
booming exports of electronics and information technology products, as the
economy bounced back strongly from an earthquake-induced decline during the
third quarter. Economic activity appears to have continued to expand at a rapid
pace in the early months of this year, with export growth remaining robust and
industrial production rising 1.3 percent (s.a.) in January. The trade surplus
narrowed significantly in February, as growing imports, driven by stronger
domestic demand and rising oil prices, outstripped exports. These factors also
contributed to a rise in consumer prices, although the 12-month rate of inflation
remained very low. Presidential elections are due to take place on March 18,
with the three front runners locked in a tight race.

In Russia, little by way of economic data has been reported since last
Greenbook. Consumer price inflation continues to slow, with 12-month
inflation falling to 25 percent in February. Russia is also still registering high
trade surpluses, supported mainly by the surge in world oil prices. In mid-
February, the London Club agreed to write off an average of 37 percent of the
principal and interest arrears on Russia's Soviet-era debt, in exchange for new
30-year Eurobonds. (The new bonds will include cross-default provisions that
essentially give them the same status as Russia's other Eurobonds, debt on
which Russia has remained current.) The new Eurobonds will have a seven-year
grace period on principal payments, with a reduced interest rate that steps up in
years eight through maturity. Analysts estimate that, including the interest rate
concessions, the London Club agreement provides debt relief amounting to
roughly 50 percent. Russia is now seeking comparable treatment from the Paris
Club.
