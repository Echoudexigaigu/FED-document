Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity continued to grow rapidly through the early spring.
Consumer and business spending have remained robust, driving large gains in
payrolls. Unfortunately, however, the ongoing tightening of labor and product
markets appears to be elevating inflation.
Real GDP
According to the advance estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real
GDP rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter.' Since the release,
we have received additional data that point--all else equal--to a downward
revision to about 4.9 percent. The largest anticipated revisions are to
consumption and inventory investment. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion
of first-quarter activity in the remainder of this section of the Greenbook
incorporates our expected revisions to the GDP data.
Labor Market Developments
Payroll employment continued to rise rapidly in recent months, with a large gain
of 340,000 in April coming on the heels of an even more remarkable increase of
458,000 in March.2 Part of this surge reflected increases in government hiring of
workers for the decennial census, but private payroll gains averaged about
265,000 in the past two months--an impressive number by itself. Indeed, the
pace of hiring by private-sector employers so far this year--222,000 per month--
now exceeds last year's rate--198,000 per month.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls rose almost 1/2 percent per month in March and April; the April level
was 0.8 percent (not at an annual rate) above the first-quarter average.
The associated employment gains in the household survey show an even more
marked step-up from last year's pace--350,000 per month in the past four
1 As noted previously, a Y2K-related speed-up in payments to defense contractors boosted
real defense spending in the fourth quarter of 1999, and the subsequent "payback" depressed
spending in the first quarter of 2000. These anomalies resulted in an overstatement of real GDP
growth in the fourth quarter of about 1/2 percentage point and an understatement of
1 percentage point in the first quarter.
2. Unusual seasonal adjustment difficulties likely inflated the change in employment in
March and lowered it in April. Because of leap year, this year the February and March
reference periods were separated by five weeks, rather than the usual four The BLS's seasonal
adjustment routines take into account the variation in interval lengths between reference periods;
in this case, however, because a five-week interval between February and March is so infrequent
(occurring once every twenty-eight years), the BLS was unable to estimate a precise correction.

months of this year, compared with 150,000 per month in 1999.3 While the
extraordinary availability of job opportunities has been accompanied by a slight
further decline in unemployment, a more notable development has been a pickup
in labor force participation. The participation rate edged back up to 67.5 percent
in April, matching the first-quarter's average and remaining well above the
67.1 percent rate that prevailed, on average, for the previous three years. In an
accounting sense, a further rise in the participation rate of adult women (aged 25
and over) explains most of the increase in the overall participation rate compared
with last year. However, in recent months participation rates for young adults
(aged 20 to 24) and for older men (aged 65 and over) have also moved up
noticeably. The belief that jobs are easy to get and will remain so--evident in
surveys by the Conference Board and University of Michigan SRC--is
apparently affecting the behavior of the employed as well: The ratio of job
leavers unemployed less than five weeks to total employment--a rough proxy for
the voluntary quit rate--has moved up, on balance, over the past year.
Other indicators suggest that labor demand remains strong. Although the four-
week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has crept up
of late, it is still very low, as is the ratio of job losers unemployed less than five
weeks to total employment. In the National Federation of Independent
Businesses's monthly survey, the fraction of firms reporting that positions were
hard to fill stepped up in April, while its measure of net hiring strength stood in
the middle of the favorable range seen over the past year.
3. These estimates include our adjustments to the historical data for the introduction of new
population controls in January 1999 and January 2000.

n.a. Not available
After taking into account the recent revised data on hours worked in the first
quarter and our current guess for output, we estimate that labor productivity in
the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent in
the first quarter of 2000 after rising almost 7 percent in the fourth quarter 4
Correcting for the probably spurious swings in defense spending reported for
these two quarters, the staff estimates that output per hour increased about
2.7 percent in the first quarter after an exceptionally strong 6.3 percent rate in the
fourth quarter of last year. All told, we estimate that nonfarm productivity in the
first quarter (adjusted for incoming data and for defense spending swings) was
up 3-1/2 percent from a year earlier.5
Industrial Production
After having posted a strong gain in the first quarter, manufacturing activity
appears to have accelerated in April. Production-worker hours posted a sizable
increase last month, and the available physical product indicators were also
4. Based on the revisions in production-worker hours in the latest labor market report, we
expect the BLS to revise up its first-quarter estimates of the change in total NFB hours by about
1/4 percentage point. Our real GDP estimate for the first quarter is consistent with a downward
revision of about 3/4 percentage point in nonfarm business output.
5 The recent Productivity and Cost release also included the first estimate of productivity in
the nonfinancial corporate sector for the fourth quarter of 1999. Productivity in this sector
increased at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter; over the four quarters ending in
1999:Q4, output per hour was up 4.2 percent, equal to the gain in the preceding four-quarter
period.

3 Nominal adjusted durable goods orders were split into three components: computers,

chain-weighted fashion.
Within durable goods, gains in output occurred throughout the first quarter in all
broad industry groups except aircraft and parts. Production of aircraft and parts
declined as a result of Boeing's planned production cutback; output was
essentially unaffected by the engineers' strike in February and March (although
deliveries and inventories were affected). In April, a three-week strike by 2,000
engineers and technicians at a Lockheed production facility reduced military
aircraft production; however, the effect on overall industrial output was
negligible.7
From an already-high annual rate of 13.1 million units in the first quarter, total
motor vehicle production climbed in April to 13.3 million units; announced
plans point to a similar pace for May and June. Looking still further ahead,
assembly schedules for the third quarter might suggest that--despite industry
forecasts to the contrary--producers are not anticipating a weakening of sales
from the torrid pace registered in recent months: Initial schedules show a

seasonal factors--which do a more complete job of adjusting for the timing of Easter--point to an
increase of 0.6 percent.
7 Unlike the Boeing strike, which included only engineers involved in the early stages of
product development, the Lockheed strike included production-line workers.

High-tech industries have also been booming, with especially robust growth in
the output of semiconductors and communications equipment. Semiconductor
production expanded at an annual rate of almost 60 percent in the first quarter,
spurred by huge demand for inputs into communications equipment as well as
strong sales of personal computers.8 This strength has led to a shortage of
Pentium III microprocessors that is expected to continue through the second
quarter. Intense demand for these microprocessors has also put upward pressure
on the price of DRAMS, as more memory chips are packaged with personal
computers that use higher-speed microprocessors. Production of
communications equipment surged in the first quarter, on the heels of a decline
in the fourth quarter of 1999 that likely reflected, in part, Y2K "lockdowns."
The average rate of increase over the past two quarters, however, is still quite
strong by historical standards for the industry.
Gains in the production of nondurables slowed, on balance, in recent months,
after shooting up last fall, when there were large increases in the output of food,
paper and products, chemicals, and publishing; nonetheless, production of
nondurables remained at a high level. Production of chemicals was bolstered by
rising foreign demand last year; after a first-quarter dip in the rate of expansion

includes business and consumer sales) jumped 4.4 percent in the first quarter (not at an annual
rate), up from a 1.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter of last year.

of the industry--driven largely by a temporary decline in chemical exports
around the turn of the year--production rebounded sharply in February.
Consumer Spending and Income
Even after taking account of expected downward revisions, the first-quarter gain
in real PCE was the sharpest since early 1983; at that time the economy was in
the initial phase of recovery after a deep recession, during which many
households probably had deferred discretionary purchases. The growth of
consumption appears to have slowed early in the second quarter.
In the motor vehicle sector, the strong gains in real income and household
wealth in recent years, coupled with favorable pricing, have continued to fuel
demand. Although down from the exceptional pace of 18.1 million units
(annual rate) in the first quarter, light vehicle sales in April, adjusted for shifts in
reporting periods, were at a robust annual rate of 17.0 million units. So far this
year, sales of light vehicles have been on a record pace.
Nominal retail sales in the control group of stores, which excludes automotive
dealers and building material and supply outlets, edged up 0.1 percent in April,
after an increase of almost 1 percent in March. Sales in the control category
were held down by decreases in outlays at apparel stores, eating and drinking
establishments, and gasoline service stations. Purchases at food stores posted
another solid increase in April, and sales in the other categories recorded
moderate increases. Factoring in our forecast for consumer prices and the latest
data on retail auto sales, we estimate that real purchases of consumer goods in
April were 1/4 percent above the first-quarter average.
Real disposable personal income increased at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the
first quarter. The published personal saving rate tumbled 1.1 percentage points,
dropping to a post-World War II low of 0.7 percent. In the absence of other
revisions, the latest retail sales data suggest an upward revision of only
0.1 percentage point to this figure. Our current estimate is that the ratio of
household net worth to disposable personal income edged up in the first quarter
from the level posted at the end of 1999; the ratio has probably slipped since the
end of March, given the decline in equity prices that has occurred.
The latest survey evidence indicates that consumers remained exceptionally
upbeat in April. The Conference Board and the SRC reported continued highly
favorable perceptions regarding current economic circumstances, and compared
with March, households expressed a bit more optimism regarding their
expectations for future economic conditions. The final report of the SRC survey
for April included respondents interviewed after the mid-month drop in stock
prices and during a period of unusual market volatility. Still, the overall index

came in just a bit lower than the preliminary estimate. The two groups of
respondents had identical views of current conditions, but the more recent
interviewees were not quite so optimistic about expected conditions as the
earlier group had been. Nonetheless, the difference was small.
Housing Markets
Residential investment rose further in the first quarter, in lagged response to a
surge in single-family starts in late 1999. Although starts slipped back after the
turn of the year, housing demand is showing only tentative signs of succumbing
to the rise in mortgage rates that occurred over the past year. Demand
undoubtedly has been bolstered by accumulated gains in stock market wealth, as
well as by rapid job growth. In some markets, supply constraints are cited as
more important in curbing building activity than any lack of demand.
Starts of single-family homes fell 3-1/2 percent in the first quarter but remained
at a high level.9 At an annual rate of 1.33 million units, starts matched the
average for 1999. Shortages of skilled construction workers, some construction
materials, and buildable lots reportedly have resulted in continued high order
backlogs for new homes. These order backlogs likely have helped to buoy
construction recently.
Sales of new single-family homes jumped to 966,000 units (annual rate) in
March, the second highest reading on record. This degree of strength is
surprising, and given the shakiness of the initially published figure, we are
inclined to discount it somewhat. But even a noticeable downward revision
could leave the first-quarter level above the 1999 average. In contrast, existing
home sales decreased 7-1/2 percent in the first quarter, to a pace 10 percent
below that registered, on average, last year. Some anecdotal reports point to a
shortage of homes for sale as the reason for this decline, and the Realtors' data
show a sharp drop in the number of homes on the market. We are hard pressed,
however, to understand this phenomenon.
Other indicators of housing demand also have been mixed. Builders' ratings of
new home sales edged down in April to a 2-1/2 year low. Similarly, the
Michigan Survey's measure of households' perceptions of home-buying
conditions remained in the lower end of the less favorable range that has
prevailed since the end of last summer--mainly because of higher mortgage
rates. In contrast, in the first week in May, the four-week moving average of the
Mortgage Bankers' Association index of purchase applications for home
9. Starts were boosted by good weather in November and December, which typically would
result in a negative "payback" in subsequent months; however, good weather continued through
the first quarter, providing some offset to the payback effect.

mortgages moved up to a new high. Some anecdotal reports suggest that buyers
have recently been rushing to get in before the Fed tightens policy.
The year-over-year change in the average price of new homes fell back to a still-
vigorous 5-1/2 percent in the first quarter from an outsized increase of
13 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. In contrast, the constant-quality price
index rose just 1.9 percent, year-to-year, in the first quarter, the smallest increase
in nearly two years.10 This mild increment is rather hard to believe, given the
anecdotal reports of bidding wars and the rising costs of construction. The
twelve-month rate of increase in the employment cost index for construction
moved up to 3-3/4 percent as of the first quarter, and the cost of construction
materials has accelerated in recent months to about a 2-1/2 percent rate. In
addition, the cost of land for homebuilding may well have increased in recent
years at rates that exceed those for labor and materials. Lot costs rose about
5 percent in 1998, and while data for 1999 are not yet available, reports from
builders indicating that the availability of developed lots is now their greatest
problem would suggest that prices have continued to rise rapidly.
In the multifamily sector, construction continued the wide swings that have
occurred over the past year. Starts dropped 41 percent in March from the
twelve-year high that was recorded in February. On balance, multifamily starts
soared 25 percent in the first quarter, to an annual rate of 392,000 units.
However, starts were unusually high relative to permits, which is a sign that the
first-quarter pace of building may not continue.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real business expenditures on equipment and
software shot up at an annual rate of 28 percent in the first quarter. The rapid
growth came on the heels of the sluggish 4 percent pace recorded in the final
quarter of last year. Robust growth of business output, abundant financing, and
the unwinding of Y2K effects likely contributed to the first-quarter acceleration.
With orders running at very high levels, the near-term outlook for equipment
spending looks decidedly upbeat.
Real outlays on communications equipment soared in the first quarter, posting a
78 percent (annual rate) gain--the fastest pace registered since 1983. In addition,
new orders for communications equipment jumped almost 10 percent (not at an
annual rate) in March; orders have been running well ahead of shipments in
recent quarters, and the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments remained high in
10. The constant-quality new home price index controls for differences over time in house
size, geography, and several other important structural characteristics.

March. Major manufacturers of networking equipment report that increased
Internet usage is driving the need for new network architectures, particularly
optical networking equipment. In addition, cable companies have been investing
heavily in preparation for their planned entry into the markets for residential and
commercial telephony and broad-band Internet services.
Real business spending on computer hardware and software is estimated to have
accelerated markedly in the first quarter, boosted by the end of many Y2K-
related computer system "lockdowns." Although the first-quarter acceleration of
software expenditures was not as pronounced as the pickup in business outlays
on hardware, the general pattern of spending in recent quarters is similar in the
two categories.
Real expenditures on transportation equipment bounced back in the first quarter
after having declined in the fourth. Surprisingly, despite reports that deliveries
had been held down by the engineers' strike at Boeing and that inventory
building was sizable, the latest Census report indicated that aircraft expenditures
jumped in the first quarter. The inventory-sales ratio for aerospace
manufacturers moved higher in March, suggesting that deliveries may remain
high in the current quarter as well.
The recent data for motor vehicles, however, have been somewhat mixed. Sales
of cars and light trucks to fleets (confidential) have remained extremely robust
so far this year. In contrast, sales of medium and heavy trucks fell in the first
quarter, more than reversing the jump late last year; the drop-off in sales in the
first quarter was concentrated in heavy trucks. Although preliminary data on net
new orders for heavy trucks in April point to a rebound from the depressed level
in March, orders last month remained more than 40 percent below that of a year
ago. The weakening demand for new heavy trucks partly reflects pressures on
truckers' profits from higher fuel costs, increasing driver wages because of tight
labor markets, and rising insurance costs. In addition, industry contacts have
indicated that a glut of used trucks has driven down their prices and further
damped demand for new trucks. Industry analysts attribute the oversupply to
one major producer that reportedly attempted to boost market share in recent
years by aggressive pricing.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, real equipment spending is
estimated to have surged at an annual rate of 16 percent in the first quarter, the
largest quarterly gain in more than six years. Industrial equipment outlays
appear to have fully recovered from the sluggishness recorded during the Asian
crisis. Moreover, expenditures on farm, construction, and mining equipment--
which had been falling steadily since early last year--seem to have turned around
in the first quarter. New orders of equipment and machinery (excluding

transportation and high-tech) jumped 6 percent (not at an annual rate) and the
level of unfilled orders rose; thus, spending appears likely to continue expanding
in coming months.
Nonresidential structures. Real private investment in nonresidential structures
jumped at an annual rate of 16-1/2 percent in the first quarter. Outlays for
buildings increased at almost a 24 percent rate, the most rapid pace since late
1996; nonetheless, the level of spending on nonresidential buildings in the first
quarter was still a tad below that in the first quarter of 1999.11 Nonresidential
construction likely received a positive impetus from unusually favorable weather
in both the fourth and first quarters.
Real expenditures for construction of office buildings increased at an annual rate
of 17 percent in the first quarter, more than offsetting a sharp decrease in the
previous quarter and putting the level of spending 5 percent above the year-
earlier period. At 1-3/4 percent, the year-over-year increase in the values of
office properties continued to drop off in the fourth quarter of 1999 (the latest
available data for the National Real Estate Index). However, year-to-year
increases in rents--which had been trending down steadily since early 1998--
leveled off at about 6 percent. Vacancy rates for office properties in downtown
and suburban locations remained relatively low: The downtown vacancy rate
edged down to 8-1/2 percent, and the rate for suburban locations was unchanged
at 10 percent.
Real investment in construction of commercial structures (which include retail
space and warehouses) rose at an annual rate of 26 percent in the first quarter,
putting the level of activity up about 3 percent from a year earlier. Following a
prolonged deceleration, the four-quarter change in both property values and rents
in the retail sector ticked up in the fourth quarter. For warehouses, the year-
over-year increase in property values dropped sharply to 2-1/2 percent in the
fourth quarter, but rents continued their modest acceleration, reaching a
4-1/2 percent rate.
Real outlays for industrial construction jumped nearly 30 percent (annual rate) in
the first quarter, the first increase in two years; still, expenditures last quarter
were 10-3/4 percent below the level of a year earlier. As of the fourth quarter,
the vacancy rate for industrial properties was 8.1 percent; this rate has changed
little, on balance, since mid-1996.
11. In addition to buildings, the nonresidential structures category includes outlays for
drilling and mining, expenditures by utilities, and investment in miscellaneous private facilities
such as streets, sewers, and parks.

Business inventories. Following a sizable accumulation in late 1999, inventory
investment moderated substantially in the first quarter. Based on the still-
incomplete book-value data, we estimate that real nonfarm inventories
accumulated at an annual rate of $29 billion (2.4 percent) in the first quarter,
down from a $72 billion rate in the fourth quarter of last year.12 As a result, the
change in investment subtracted 1.8 percentage points from the increase in real
GDP in the first quarter, after having boosted the fourth-quarter figure by
1.4 percentage points. Some of the step-down in nonfarm inventory
accumulation may have reflected the unwinding of precautionary stocks held in
advance of the century date change. In any event, the real inventory-sales ratio
evidently fell sharply further.
Inventory investment in the manufacturing sector was about unchanged in the
first quarter. In real terms, we estimate that manufacturers accumulated
inventories (excluding finished motor vehicle stocks) at an annual rate of
$9-1/2 billion last quarter, following a $9-1/2 billion increase in the fourth
quarter. In contrast, total book-value inventories, which were boosted by higher
prices--particularly for petroleum and related products--increased at an annual
rate of $22 billion, following a $19 billion increase in the fourth quarter. Last
quarter's real stockbuilding was led by the aircraft industry, as the engineers'
strike at Boeing stalled the delivery of a large number of airplanes. Most other
manufacturing categories recorded moderate inventory accumulations in the first
quarter. Nominal shipments rose briskly, and the ratio of inventories to
shipments fell to a historically low level.
We estimate that real wholesale inventories (excluding motor vehicles) posted a
$13.6 billion (annual rate) gain last quarter, a shade above the fourth-quarter
accumulation. In book-value terms, distributors built stocks at a $22.5 billion
annual rate, about the same as the pace recorded in the fourth quarter. Sales
expanded apace, and the ratio of non-auto inventories to sales inched down in
the first quarter.
The BEA estimates that real retail inventories increased negligibly in the first
quarter, after having risen at a $30 billion pace in the fourth quarter of 1999.
The first-quarter slowdown in investment likely reflected, in part, the liquidation
of precautionary Y2K stocks held by retailers. Excluding motor vehicles, the
average increase in book-value stocks in January and February was $7 billion
(annual rate), well below the $28 billion rate of accumulation posted in the
12. On balance, book-value manufacturing and wholesale trade inventory investment
(excluding motor vehicles) in March was $20 billion lower than the BEA had assumed in the
advance NIPA estimate. The data for retail inventory investment will be released tomorrow; the
BEA had assumed a March increase of $12 billion (excluding motor vehicles).

Federal government. The projected federal budget surplus continues to grow,
and estimates for the current fiscal year now generally exceed $200 billion.
Over the twelve months ending in March, the surplus totaled $138 billion,
$48 billion more than the surplus over the preceding twelve months. In addition,
the incoming data point to a noticeable rise in personal income tax payments in
April.
Although the deficit in March was $13 billion larger than a year earlier, the
increase reflected timing shifts that temporarily raised expenditures and cut
receipts; in particular, refunds in March were substantially greater than last year,
owing to an extra Friday, the day of the week when almost all refund checks are
issued. Excluding refunds, personal tax collections were up about 8 percent in
March. Corporate tax payments, which largely reflect final payments on 1999
income tax liability, surged about 30 percent in March, consistent with the sharp
rebound in corporate profits in the fourth quarter of last year.
Preliminary data from the Daily Treasury Statements indicate that final
individual income tax payments this filing season are up about 17 percent over
last year. Total refunds issued thus far this tax season are about 8 percent greater
than last year, though the timing of refunds was pushed forward as a result of
faster processing by the IRS.
March outlays, after adjusting for payment timing shifts, were 4 percent higher
than a year earlier, somewhat above the 3 percent average pace seen over the
past twelve months. Notably, Medicaid spending continued to surge in March,
while Medicare outlays remained subdued. Defense spending was up about
5 percent above last year's levels, but defense spending for the first quarter as a
whole was well below the fourth-quarter level because of the Y2K-related shift
in payments to service providers.
Congress has sketched out a blueprint of its fiscal policy proposals for the next
five years. The budget resolution allows for at least $150 billion in tax cuts over
five years and sets aside up to $40 billion for unspecified Medicare reform and a
new prescription drug benefit. Total discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001
is set at $624 billion, enough to keep real spending roughly constant, but about
$10 billion less than the request in the administration's budget. The fiscal
outlook remains quite uncertain, however, because this blueprint is based on
much lower surplus projections than now appear likely, and, of course, final

policy depends on the result of negotiations with the Administration. Finally,
the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act was passed and signed. This law
eliminates the social security earnings test that reduced benefits for certain
beneficiaries aged 65 to 69; it is expected to raise social security outlays about
$4 billion per year over the next few years.
State and local governments. Real purchases of consumption and investment
goods by state and local governments advanced at an annual rate of 7 percent in
the first quarter, even faster than the rapid pace in the fourth quarter of last
year.13 The strong pace of spending over the past two quarters largely reflected
higher highway construction spending, which has been boosted in recent years
by rising federal grants and strong state and local fiscal positions.14 In addition,
construction of education facilities remained on the upward trend that has been
apparent since early last year. Meanwhile, real consumption expenditures rose
3.3 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, a little below the pace in 1999.
Prices and Labor Costs
The data received since the last Greenbook included some large increases in
wages and prices. Although there are reasons for discounting this news to an
extent, the latest readings clearly are consistent with our expectation of an upturn
in the underlying inflation trend. Tightness in labor markets and the energy-
induced pickup in consumer price inflation over the past year appear to be
pushing up labor costs. At the same time, businesses apparently have enjoyed a
bit more pricing "leverage" and have passed through some of these higher costs
to consumers.
The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers
increased at an annual rate of 5.9 percent over the three months ended in March,
the largest quarterly increase in seventeen years. Wages and salaries increased at
a 4.9 percent rate, while benefits rose 9.7 percent.
Given the noise in the quarterly ECI figures, we tend to emphasize moving
averages. Even on this basis, however, the acceleration in pay rates is striking.
Over the twelve months ending in March, hourly compensation increased
4.6 percent, versus the 3.0 percent rise in the year-earlier period. Faster rates of
increase in benefit costs (about a quarter of total compensation) accounted for
more than half of the acceleration over the past year.
13. The slight downward revision from BEA's advance estimate of 7.4 percent reflected the
receipt of data on construction put-in-place that indicated outlays were somewhat weaker than
the BEA had assumed.
14. Increases in highway construction over the past two quarters also appear to have been
boosted significantly by the unusually warm and dry weather between November and March.

Among the major components of benefits, health insurance costs rose
substantially in the first quarter and were up 7.6 percent on a twelve-month
basis; these costs have accelerated nearly 4 percentage points in the past year on
top of a noticeable acceleration in the year before that.15 Confidential detail on
other benefits components also shows some pickups.16 Nonproduction bonuses
rose 9.4 percent after actually having declined in the year-earlier period.17 Given
that bonuses partly reflect corporate performance, this pattern is consistent with
recent movements in corporate profits, which were weak in the year-earlier
period following the Asian crisis but have since recovered. In addition, the
increase in paid leave picked up in the past year.
Within wages and salaries, accelerations occurred in many industries, but an
exceptionally large increase in finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE)
accounted for roughly two-thirds of the pickup over the past year. The jump in
FIRE wages and salaries may be related to commissions tied directly to
increased activity in the sector. However, competition for workers is reported to
be intense in these industries, suggesting that to some degree the increases in
FIRE wages may also be indicative of tight labor markets.
In contrast to the ECI, the productivity and cost (P&C) measure of hourly
compensation in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of
4.2 percent in the first quarter, about the same as the pace in 1999. Over the past
four quarters, the P&C measure of hourly compensation in the nonfarm business
sector increased 4.3 percent, slightly less than the 4.6 percent increase in the ECI
for hourly compensation in private industry. Over the preceding two years, the
P&C measure of hourly compensation had increased more rapidly.
In the past, we have speculated that one reason for the more rapid increase in the
P&C measure in the earlier period is that it incorporates lagged information on
employee compensation from the exercise of stock options, whereas the ECI
does not. While it is possible that stock options have contributed less to growth
in hourly compensation recently than they did a year ago, the P&C compensation
15. The California Public Employees' Retirement System is currently considering a
proposal that would result in an increase of 4.9 percent, on average, in its HMO premiums in
2001. The proposed increase would be only about half as large as the one that took effect in
2000, mainly because next year's increase would be restrained by the imposition of higher co-
payments for prescription drugs and office visits. In addition, nearly one-fourth of Calpers
members are enrolled in two large preferred provider plans (PPOs), in which premiums are
slated to rise 13 percent and 19 percent next year. On balance, if the HMO proposal is adopted,
overall Calpers premiums will likely rise about 7 percent, on average, next year.

bonuses to include hiring and referral bonuses.

data might not reflect such a phenomenon accurately until they fully incorporate
the 1999 and 2000 unemployment insurance records; in any event, we think it is
unlikely that the swing in this form of compensation would be large enough to
fully explain the change in the relative increase in these two measures of hourly
compensation. Another possible explanation for the divergence is that the ECI
incorporates more up-to-date information on benefit costs, notably health
benefits. Although the BEA can, in principle, incorporate ECI benefits
information in estimating P&C hourly compensation, it does so only informally,
and, in any case, the first-quarter ECI data were not available when the BEA
prepared the advance estimate of the first-quarter national accounts.
The April employment report gave us our first glimpse of wage developments
for the second quarter- Average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers increased 0.4 percent in April and have increased at a
4.5 percent rate so far this year Over the twelve months ended in April, average
hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent, up slightly from the increase over the
preceding twelve-month period.
The most recent consumer price index data are for March, when the CPI
increased 0.7 percent, the largest monthly increase since April of last year. A
5 percent increase in energy prices contributed to the large March increase;
however, the CPI for items other than food and energy jumped 0.4 percent, the
largest monthly increase in more than five years.
Over the twelve months ended in March, the overall CPI increased 3.7 percent,
compared with a 1.7 percent increase over the preceding twelve-month period.
Most of this pickup in inflation stems from energy prices, which increased
24 percent over the past year after having fallen in the year-earlier period. The
CPI excluding food and energy increased 2.4 percent over the twelve months
ended in March, a pickup of about 1/2 percent from the year-earlier period once
allowance is made for changes in statistical procedures.
The surge in energy prices over the past year has been driven largely by
increases in the world price of crude oil. Crude oil prices peaked in March and
then dropped sharply following the announcement of a new agreement among
OPEC producers. (See the International Developments section for more details.)
Product prices began falling shortly thereafter, and surveys suggest that retail
gasoline prices fell about 3 percent in April.
Crude oil prices also affect non-energy inflation through petroleum's role as an
input into production. Although the effects of crude oil price changes on
gasoline prices are very rapid, econometric evidence suggests that the indirect
effects of energy price changes are more sluggish, being spread over several

quarters. Among the economic factors that account for a slower pass-through is
the use of hedging by some large energy users; for example, anecdotal reports
suggest that airlines try to use futures contracts to mitigate the short-term effects
of crude oil price swings on fuel costs.18 On balance, based upon our
econometric models, the indirect effects of energy price movements should have
boosted core inflation over the past twelve months by roughly 1/4 percentage
point. The models also suggest that the upward pressure on core prices could
continue for a few more quarters. Of course, these model results represent rough
estimates of the average relations over a number of years, and they might not
capture the particulars of the recent episode. (One hypothesis is that short-run
pass-throughs now are less pronounced than they were because monetary policy
is seen as less accommodative. The hedging story also suggests a possibly
smaller effect if it was practiced less widely in the past.)
Several outsized price increases contributed to the large increase in the CPI
excluding food and energy in March. In particular, prices of tobacco products
increased 1 percent, as New York state increased its cigarette tax. Jumps of
3 percent in the index for lodging-away-from-home and 4-1/2 percent in air fares
also added to the rise in the core rate. While both hotel rates and air fares are
quite volatile from month to month, they also likely are responding to strong
demand. In addition, airlines obviously were feeling pressure from higher fuel
costs. The largest single category of the CPI, owners' equivalent rent, increased
0.3 percent in each of the first three months of 2000, up from a surprisingly low
average monthly increase of 0.2 percent last year.
Over the four quarters ended in the first quarter of this year, the price index for
personal consumer expenditures other than food and energy rose 1.6 percent,
about 1/2 percentage point less than the increase in the core CPI over the same
period.19 Among components, the biggest difference occurred within durable
goods, where the PCE price index for durable goods fell 1.9 percent over the
past four quarters, compared with a drop of just 0.8 percent in the CPI for
18. The tendency of firms to attenuate the effects of energy cost swings on prices is
apparent in the response of profits to energy price shocks; For non-energy-producing firms,
profits tend to fall in the aftermath of an increase in energy prices, as increases in costs are not
immediately matched by an increase in prices.
19 As we have noted before, the CPI and the PCE price index differ in several important
ways. First, the weights placed on various items in the CPI differ from those in the PCE price
index; this difference in weights accounts for about 0.2 percentage point of the difference in
core inflation over the past four quarters as measured by these two indexes. Second, while the
CPI is the primary source data for the PCE price index, the PCE index uses different sources in
some areas. Finally, the coverage of the PCE price index is broader than the CPI--although over
the most recent four-quarter period, items that were included in the PCE price index but not in
the CPI actually added 0.2 percentage point to the core PCE price index.

durable goods. The main reason for this difference is the smaller weight of
computers in the CPI.
According to the Survey Research Center, the median of household expectations
of inflation over the next twelve months was 3.2 percent in April, the same as in
March. However, this level of inflation expectations marks a step-up from that
of the preceding several months and is about 1/2 percentage point higher than
expectations in the year-earlier period. Expectations of inflation over the next
five to ten years remain more subdued; the median April reading was for
inflation of 2.8 percent, down from 3.1 percent in March and little changed from
year-earlier expectations.20
Raw commodity prices have been mixed in recent weeks. Prices of steel scrap
and aluminum have dropped notably. Prices of these and many other metals
moved up sharply throughout 1999, with press reports generally indicating a
strong economy both in the United States and abroad as a major factor behind
the rebound. Metals prices reached a peak early this year and have since
retreated. Major crop prices have been mixed: Soybean prices have moved up;
wheat prices are down sharply; and corn prices are about unchanged. Among
livestock, prices of hogs and chickens have moved up sharply in recent weeks.
In the case of hogs, the price is up nearly 30 percent over the past year, reflecting
strong demand--notably for bacon for restaurant use--and production cutbacks.
20. In recent weeks, the interest rate on ten-year Treasury securities has increased more than
50 basis points In contrast, the interest rate on inflation-indexed Treasury securities has
changed little over this period. If changes in inflation expectations were the only factor driving
the spread between these interest rates, we could infer that ten-year inflation expectations had
moved up sharply since early April. However, the three years of experience with inflation-
indexed securities suggest that the spread is affected by other factors besides inflation
expectations. For example, during the financial crisis of the fall of 1998, the "flight to liquidity"
meant that the interest rate on the traditional ten-year security fell much more than the rate on
the inflation-indexed issue, which is much more thinly traded. Because such factors can be an
important influence on the spreads between these rates, it may be premature to conclude from
this evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have recently shot up.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Nominal interest rates have risen since the March FOMC meeting--some quite
substantially--in response to evidence that economic growth has remained
vigorous and that wage and price increases are picking up. A further increase in
the federal funds rate is now viewed as a certainty at next week's meeting of the
FOMC, and the predominant expectation is that it will be a 50 basis point hike.
Equity markets have been volatile, and share prices of many high-tech firms
have plunged as investors have become skittish about the extremely rich
valuations.
Businesses have continued to borrow heavily, but, given the less hospitable bond
markets, they have turned more to commercial paper and bank financing.
Households also have been piling on debt despite increases in borrowing costs.
In contrast, higher tax collections from a robust economy have reduced federal
borrowing needs; higher interest rates have discouraged advance refundings by
state and local governments, while retirements from previous operations have
been sizable.
Interest Rates and Stock Prices
Since the March FOMC meeting, market participants have come to expect a
greater tightening of monetary policy over the remainder of this year. Treasury
coupon yields in the two- to ten-year range moved up 30 to 35 basis points; the
rise in the two-year note was likely muted to some degree by the Treasury
statements suggesting that issuance may be cut back in the future.
Among private securities, investment-grade corporate yields have risen about 50
to 60 basis points, and junk yields somewhat more, since late March. In addition
to concerns about an overheated economy, investors' assessments of credit
quality appear to have worsened a bit in light of rising default rates and recent
equity market volatility. In contrast to the inversion in the Treasury market,
most corporate yield curves have retained an upward tilt.
Equity prices, as measured by the Wilshire 5000, fell 9 percent over the
intermeeting period, as investors seem to have had second thoughts about
prospects for high-tech stocks. Many of the dot-com companies with no
earnings and shaky prospects have seen their share prices plummet, sometimes
to well below their IPO levels. On net, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has declined
about 27 percent against a backdrop of highly volatile price movements. In
contrast, the DJIA and S&P 500 indexes, which include a larger complement of
"Old Economy" stocks, edged down only about 3 and 5 percent, respectively.
These indexes likely received support from the good news about earnings. With
nearly all S&P 500 firms' first-quarter results in, earnings are up about

20 percent from four quarters earlier, well above the increase expected by
analysts; the decline in share prices thus was generally a contraction of price-
earnings multiples.
Business Finance
After setting a record in the first quarter, gross equity issuance remained strong
in the first half of April but then cooled as stock prices plunged and volatility
shot up. Many IPOs priced below their filing range, and first-day returns fell
back sharply, causing many companies to postpone their planned offerings.
Nonetheless, total issuance in April was strong because AT&T issued a tracking
stock for AT&T Wireless, raising a record $10 billion in an IPO that priced
within its filing range.
After showing strength in February and March, gross corporate bond issuance
dropped substantially in April. As long-term rates rose and their future path
became more uncertain, several planned deals were pulled. And faced with the
greater uncertainty, dealers and investors have sought to reduce their exposure to
all but the most liquid corporate bonds. As evidence of the strong preference for
liquidity, the share of total bond proceeds attributable to larger (and so more
liquid) issues was very high in the first quarter. Investment-grade borrowers also
have responded to market pressures by reducing the share of longer-maturity
bonds and increasing the share of floating-rate bonds. Junk-rated borrowers who
had been issuing substantial amounts of convertible bonds were shut out of the
market by the drop in share prices and the rise in volatility. Still, some firms
with pending mergers have announced intentions to issue bonds in the near term.
With the difficulties in the bond market, firms have turned to other sources of
credit. Commercial paper bulged in April as many firms borrowed to raise
temporary financing to complete acquisitions ahead of planned bond issues.
C&I loans from banks were strong in April and may have been elevated as some
firms were shut out of the bond market. The May Senior Loan Officer Survey
confirmed some strengthening of demand for bank loans by speculative-grade
companies because of unfavorable conditions in the junk bond market, though
the survey question referred to the past twelve months rather than specifically to
April. At the same time that firms were turning to banks, many banks reported
that they had continued to tighten both standards and terms on business loans
over the past three months, the tightening of standards being more widespread
than has been the case for some time.
Merger activity has continued at an impressive pace, although equity retired
from mergers has been a bit below the amounts of the past few years. Firms
have also continued to repurchase their shares. Data through the fourth quarter
indicate that actual repurchases in 1999 were below the elevated 1998 levels.

Announced repurchases for the first quarter of this year came to a record
$65 billion. Investors may have begun to wonder whether firms, in an effort to
increase shareholder value through buybacks, will wind up leveraging their
balance sheets so much that they reduce their credit rating.1
Credit quality has deteriorated somewhat since the start of the year, and quality
spreads over AAA corporates have widened for both below-investment-grade
and BBB-rated firms. So far this year, Moody's has downgraded, on net,
$40 billion of public bonds of nonfinancial firms (but it has placed a net of
$30 billion on watch for a future upgrade). The ratio of liabilities of failed
businesses to total liabilities has surged so far this year, while the default rate on
outstanding junk bonds has moved a bit above the elevated level it reached last
year. So far in 2000, thirty-eight firms have defaulted on a total of $8 billion of
outstanding junk bonds. Defaults were highest in telecommunications but
occurred in all sectors. The staff's model for forecasting the default rate on junk
bonds, which aggregates firm-level projections based on various financial
measures and asset price volatility, predicts some further deterioration.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Primary commercial mortgage interest rates have risen since late March, as have
yields on AAA-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). Because
the spread between CMBS and Treasury yields has been erratic over the past
year and a half, conduits have turned to the swaps market for a better pricing
benchmark. Indeed, these conduits, which originate and pool loans backing
CMBS, have begun quoting primary mortgage rates as spreads over swap rates
rather than Treasury rates.
Gross CMBS issuance in the first quarter was the lightest since the third quarter
of 1997. Offerings remained weak in April, although the forward calendar
suggests that it is likely to pick up this month and next. Despite the fall in
CMBS issuance, growth in overall commercial mortgage debt appears to have
remained robust, particularly at commercial banks. The May Senior Loan
Officer Survey confirmed somewhat stronger demand for commercial real estate
loans over the past three months even as banks appear to be tightening credit
standards for approving these loans.
The share prices of real estate investment trusts have risen about 9 percent since
the March FOMC and are up nearly 17 percent from their trough in mid-
December. The recovery in REIT stocks appears to be related to a shift in
1. In one case that illustrated the potential consequences of distributing cash to
shareholders, Ford recently announced a $10 billion special dividend and was promptly
downgraded by Moody's from Al to A2.

investor sentiment in favor of companies with actual earnings, rather than a
fundamental change in the property markets that would affect the future earnings
of REITs.
Household Finance
The ratio of household assets to disposable income reached a new high in the
first quarter, but has likely fallen off somewhat with the subsequent declines in
the stock market. Net inflows to equity funds remained strong through March
and April despite weaker equity prices and heightened market volatility.
However, there are indications of some weakening of equity fund inflows in
early May. The rotation out of total return funds and into capital appreciation
funds that had been evident in the previous few months abated in April, perhaps
in reaction to the recent rout in technology stocks. Bond and hybrid funds
continue to experience outflows.
Consumer loan rates have continued to rise. Rates on new car loans have risen
26 basis points since the March FOMC and are now 83 basis points above their
trough in June 1999. Rates on home equity lines of credit, thirty-year fixed-rate
mortgages, and one-year ARMs have increased around 25 basis points and all
are at least 120 basis points above their respective troughs in late 1998 or early
1999. Rates on one-year ARMs now stand at their highest level since September
1991.
Data usually are slower in coming for household debt than for corporate, but at
this point there is no indication that higher interest rates have put much of a dent
in household debt growth. Consumer credit grew at an 11 percent annual rate in
the first quarter, in connection with strong purchases of consumer durables,
especially automobiles. Although robust, this quarterly growth rate obscured an
underlying monthly deceleration, a pattern consistent with moderately weaker
demand for consumer loans reported on the May Senior Loan Officer Survey.
Growth in home mortgage debt in the first quarter is estimated to have remained
robust, based on the strength of such indicators as the MBA purchase index and
home sales. The Senior Loan Officer Survey for May sounded a weaker note for
housing finance. A substantial fraction of banks reported weaker demand for
residential mortgages, a trend that has appeared in the last four quarterly surveys.
By easing terms on these loans, banks may have been responding to slower
growth of demand.
The combination of rapid debt growth and higher interest rates has pushed up the
debt-service burden recently. Recent measures of household credit quality,
however, have been stable or even slightly improved. Mortgage delinquencies
on loans guaranteed or held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remained at or near
the lowest levels in the eight-year history of the two series. Moody's index of

credit card delinquencies fell further in February, reaching a four-year low.
Delinquency rates on auto loans at captive finance companies reached a twelve-
year low in March. Because delinquencies tend to rise as loans age, the surge of
new loans may be adding to the decline in delinquency rates by boosting the
denominator (total loans) at a faster rate than the numerator (delinquent loans).
Treasury Finance
Treasury cash balances once again have been swollen by surprisingly strong non-
withheld individual tax receipts over the second half of April and early May. On
a cumulative basis, receipts are now $28 billion higher than last year's robust
levels. Because of the improved federal budget position, the Treasury is on track
to pay down more than $220 billion in marketable debt this fiscal year. As a
result, it has had to reconsider auction sizes and schedules. On May 3, in
connection with its refunding announcement, the Treasury announced further
cutbacks in the size of two-year note auctions, conducted monthly, and indicated
that it might reduce the frequency of those auctions. The Treasury also
announced that it was considering reduced issuance or elimination of the one-
year bill. The refunding itself took place on May 9 and 10 and consisted of
$12 billion of five-year notes and an $8 billion reopening of the ten-year note.
Both auctions went well.
The Treasury also announced a regular schedule of two buybacks per month, at
least until the next refunding in August. So far, four buyback operations have
been conducted, through which the Treasury repurchased a total of $7 billion par
value of debt. Since the March FOMC meeting, $2 billion of debt with
maturities of twenty to twenty-five years were bought back on April 20, and
$3 billion with maturities of fifteen to twenty-five years were repurchased on
April 27.2 Both operations were roughly in line with expectations, had
comfortable bid-to-cover ratios, and elicited little market reaction.
Liquidity in the Treasury securities market deteriorated a bit during the
intermeeting period, reflecting a more cautious attitude among dealers amid
market volatility. Bid-asked spreads widened, and daily trading volume for most
on-the-run issues edged down.
Agency Finance
Since the last FOMC meeting, yield spreads on the debt of government-
sponsored enterprises over Treasuries rose about 25 basis points as uncertainty
about the degree of federal backing of the GSEs increased. Spreads were
boosted in large part by testimony from the Treasury endorsing a Congressional
2. The $3 billion buyback operation settled on May I and thus does not show up in the
April column in the table.

proposal to sever the agencies' lines of credit with the government and by
Treasury's suggestion that commercial bank holdings of agency debt should be
subject to the same limits (10 percent of capital) that apply to corporate bonds.
Despite the wider spreads, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to issue new
benchmark debt at a very strong pace, in accordance with their announced
calendars. The $14 billion offered since the last FOMC meeting brought the
total outstanding of Fannie Mae's Benchmark Notes and Freddie Mac's
Reference Notes to $220 billion, a remarkable amount considering that these
programs were begun in early 1998. Only about $11 billion of this total
represents existing agency debt that was exchanged for the new securities. The
agency market has now become liquid enough to support an active futures
market, as evidenced by the good reception of the futures contracts based on
five- and ten-year agency notes recently introduced on the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds picked up in March and April but
remained below the levels of the last two years. Issues to raise new capital were
only a bit below the pace in recent years, but refunding volume remained
depressed owing to the rise in interest rates. Nonetheless, some refunding deals
were made possible by credit upgrades, which reduced rates for the issuers.
With upgrades outnumbering downgrades by a substantial margin so far this
year, credit quality (except in the not-for-profit health care sector) continued to
improve. Improved credit quality has probably contributed to an edging down in
municipal yields since the start of this year, but, with long-term Treasury yields
falling even more on supply concerns, the ratio of municipal bond yields to
Treasuries has risen. In contrast, the ratio of municipal yields to an index of
AAA corporate bonds has fallen.
Money and Bank Credit
With the post-Y2K runoff of liquid balances that had held down money growth
in February completed, M2 and M3 rebounded over March and April. M2
growth in April was also boosted by larger-than-usual buildups of liquid
balances to pay taxes. Yet, even aside from likely tax-related effects, M2 has
been strong in the face of rising opportunity costs. Robust income growth has
surely supported this expansion, and higher stock market volatility may also
have contributed.
M3 growth snapped back to a 12-1/4 percent annual rate in March but moderated
to a 6-1/4 percent pace in April. Institutional money funds expanded briskly in
March and then slumped in April, reflecting the lagged adjustment of their yields

to changes in market rates. The RP and eurodollar components of M3
contracted in April, but strong growth in large time deposits plus the retail
deposit inflows that boosted M2 provided ample funding for the expansion of
bank credit. Net of a boost from mergers of thrift institutions into commercial
banks, growth in bank credit averaged about 8-3/4 percent at an annual rate over
the last two months. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, bank credit
has been accelerating since the second quarter of 1999.
Banks' holdings of securities expanded moderately in March and April, and loan
growth was brisk. Business loans grew at the same robust rate recorded in the
first quarter of this year and probably were buoyed by the slowdown in the high-
yield bond market in recent months. Thrift mergers added about 5 percentage
points to real estate loan growth in April, mainly in residential components,
while the commercial component continued the rapid advance it has shown for
the past several quarters.
First-quarter results at twenty-five large bank holding companies showed
increased profits (year-over-year), mainly from investment management and
securities underwriting. In addition, asset quality remained good and noninterest
expense appeared to be under control, suggesting that the recent reported
tightening of credit supply was not being driven by pressures on earnings.

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The May 2000 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (BLPS)
focused primarily on changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to
businesses and households over the past three months. Supplementary questions
addressed the effect of conditions in the high-yield bond market on demand for C&I
loans, changes in terms on residential real estate lending over the past two years, the
distribution of loan-to-value ratios on home mortgage originations dunng the past three
months, and loans to purchase and carry securities. Loan officers from fifty-seven
large domestic banks and twenty-one U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
participated in the survey. The responses indicate that banks became significantly
more cautious lenders over the past three months.
The survey results point to an intensification of the recent tendency toward firmer
business lending practices. The percentage of domestic banks tightening standards on
C&I loans was the largest since the November 1998 survey, and the percentage of U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks that tightened standards also rose. Both
domestic and foreign banks tightened terms on C&I loans as well, particularly risk
premiums, most commonly citing a less certain or more unfavorable economic outlook
as the reason. In addition, a notable fraction of banks raised standards for commercial
real estate loans.
Domestic banks noted that demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms
had decreased, on net, over the past three months, while a small net fraction reported
that demand from small firms had increased. Meanwhile, more than half of the foreign
branches and agencies reported weaker demand. Nonetheless, both domestic and
foreign banks reported that demand for C&I loans had been boosted by unfavorable
conditions in the high-yield bond market, and most were fairly receptive to these
customers.
In general, standards for residential mortgage loans were unchanged relative to three
months ago. However, a significant fraction of banks reported having easier terms on
residential mortgages relative to two years ago, including narrower spreads of loan
rates over the cost of funds and increases in the maximum size of loans. As in the past
four surveys, a large fraction of banks reported that demand for home mortgages had
weakened. A notable fraction of banks also reported a modest decrease in demand for
consumer loans. Most respondents reported no change in their willingness to make
consumer installment loans.
Banks reported that the pickup in loans to purchase and carry securities since last fall
was the result of strong demand from nonbank brokers and dealers as well as from
private banking and retail clients. Most security loans are made to brokers and dealers.
Most banks indicated that a very large percentage of their security loans are
collateralized. At domestic banks, the most common form of collateral is equity
instruments, whereas at foreign branches and agencies, U.S. government and agency
securities were as commonly used for collateral as equities.

III-A-2
Lending to Businesses
Almost 25 percent of domestic respondents reported having tightened standards on C&I
loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months, double the 12
percent last quarter. For large and middle-market firms, the percentage of banks
tightening was the largest since the November 1998 survey, and for small firms the
percentage tightening rose above that level, to 21 percent. The share of U.S. branches
and agencies of foreign banks reporting tighter lending standards also rose, to about 40
percent. Similarly, more than 20 percent of domestic and foreign banks reported
somewhat tighter standards on commercial real estate loans. No banks indicated that
they had eased standards on either C&I or commercial real estate loans.
Large fractions of banks also reported a further tightening of lending terms. For large
and middle-market firms, 49 percent of domestic respondents and 43 percent of foreign
branches and agencies, on net, reported higher premiums on riskier loans. In addition,
more than a third of domestic banks, on net, charged higher fees and increased spreads
of loan rates over their cost of funds. Significant fractions of foreign banks increased
fees and reduced the maximum size of credit lines. For small firms, 36 percent of
domestic banks reported charging higher spreads on riskier loans, and smaller
percentages also reported tightening all terms mentioned in the survey. Among both
foreign and domestic banks that had tightened standards or terms on C&I loans, a less
favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and a reduced tolerance for risk were
most often reported as reasons for the tightening. A worsening of industry-specific
problems was also mentioned by a substantial fraction of banks.
Almost 20 percent of domestic banks reported stronger demand for C&I loans from
large and middle-market firms, whereas more than 25 percent saw weaker loan
demand. A small net fraction of banks reported stronger demand from small firms.
Domestic banks reporting stronger demand cited a wide variety of reasons as about
equally important; banks reporting weaker demand most commonly cited reduced
business fixed investment as the reason. More than half the foreign branches and
agencies reported weaker demand for C&I loans, reflecting reduced need for merger
and acquisition financing and increases in internally generated funds at their customers.
On net, a small fraction of domestic banks reported moderately stronger demand for
commercial real estate loans; in contrast, 25 percent of foreign respondents reported
weaker demand.
Two special questions addressed the extent to which C&I lending has been affected by
developments in the market for below-investment-grade bonds over the past year. A
large fraction of domestic respondents, and more than 40 percent of large banks,
reported that demand has been somewhat strengthened by below-investment-grade
borrowers that have turned to banks because of unfavorable conditions in the high-yield
bond market. Out of sixteen banks that reported additional demand, ten reported
having been fairly receptive, five reported having been fairly unreceptive, and one
reported having been very unreceptive to these customers. Almost half the branches
and agencies reported stronger demand, with most being fairly receptive.

III-A-3
Lending to Households
The deterioration in the demand for home mortgage loans continued in May. On net,
43 percent of respondents reported weaker demand than three months ago. Banks have
now been reporting weaker demand for home mortgage loans, on net, for the past four
quarters. Over the past three months, three banks eased their credit standards for
approving residential mortgage loans and all others kept their standards unchanged.
A special question revealed that terms on residential mortgage loans are generally less
stringent, on net, than they were two years ago. On net, almost half the banks surveyed
have increased the maximum size of residential mortgages that they are willing to
approve, and about 30 percent have narrowed the spread of loan rates over their banks'
cost of funds. About 20 percent of domestic respondents, on net, also indicated that
they have lowered origination fees relative to two years ago.
On balance, banks indicated that they are more willing to make high loan-to-value
loans than they were two years ago. More than 30 percent of the respondents noted
that they have eased their down-payment requirements, while just three banks reported
that they had tightened requirements. Nonetheless, more than half of residential
mortgage loans originated at banks in the past three months had a loan-to-value ratio
greater than 80 percent, and almost 80 percent of loans were made with more than
10 percent down.
A small number of domestic banks reported less willingness to make consumer
installment loans compared with three months ago. Standards and terms for both credit
card and other consumer loans also remained unchanged at most banks. However, a
few banks reported a moderate tightening of standards, and about 10 percent of banks,
on net, reported charging higher spreads over banks' cost of funds on consumer loans
other than credit card loans. On net, 22 percent of domestic banks reported moderately
weaker demand for all types of consumer loans.
Loans to Purchase and Carry Securities
Loans to purchase and carry securities expanded rapidly late last year and in the early
months of 2000; a series of special questions addressed banks' activities in the market
for such loans.' Domestic respondents indicated that the expansion of security loans
resulted from a significant increase in demand from nonbank brokers and dealers; many
also noted increased demand from private banking and other retail customers.2 One
bank noted that the broker-dealers were in turn using the loans to finance their
customers, and another reported that demand was being spurred by high equity values.
Domestic banks reported that 62 percent of their loans to purchase and carry securities
were made to nonbank brokers and dealers and 28 percent went to private banking and
other retail customers. At branches and agencies of foreign banks, almost all security

brokers and dealers and all loans, whether secured (except by real estate) or unsecured, to any
other borrower for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities.
2. Responses are weighted by the weekly average of security loans outstanding in April.

loans were made to nonbank brokers and dealers. Only a minority of security loans at
domestic and foreign banks are made under commitment.
Banks accounting for 76 percent of all security loans among respondent banks reported
that more than three-quarters of their loans to purchase and carry securities are
collateralized. Equity instruments are the most common forms of collateral, especially
for retail customers; U.S. government and agency securities are a distant second. At
branches and agencies, compared with domestic banks collateral was somewhat less
common and was more likely to be U.S. government securities or other debt
instruments.

The value of exports in February was little changed from January as declines in
aircraft, telecommunications equipment, semiconductors, and fuel were offset by
increases in other exported items, including consumer goods and service
receipts. For January-February combined at an annual rate, exports were
1/2 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Most major trade
categories posted moderate increases, except for aircraft, fuels, and chemicals,
which declined. By destination, the largest increases in exports were to Canada,
Western Europe, and Mexico.
The value of imports rose sharply in February, as in January, with most of the
increase in oil (both price and quantity). A drop in imports of automotive
products from Canada (from notably elevated levels in the previous two months)
and consumer goods was largely offset by increases in imported industrial
supplies, machinery, and service payments. For January-February combined at
an annual rate, imports were 3-1/2 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of last
year, with increases in all major trade categories, other than foods.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The price of imported oil rose sharply in the first quarter of 2000, marking
the fourth consecutive quarter of sizable increases. The average spot price of
West Texas Intermediate was nearly $30 per barrel in March, but fell to $25.75

per barrel in April. The decrease resulted primarily from OPEC's decision in
late March to increase production 1.7 million barrels per day. Production
increases from Mexico and Norway, higher exports from Russia, and weak
consumption associated with abnormally warm weather also put downward
pressure on oil prices. Recently, oil prices have retraced some of that decline in
response to a labor strike in Norway which temporarily interrupted shipments
and to indications that OPEC does not intend to increase production further in
the next few months. Spot WTI is currently trading around $29 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of non-oil goods imports increased moderately in
March for the second consecutive month, primarily from rising prices of
imported "core" goods (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors).
Higher prices of industrial supplies were only partly offset by declines in prices
for consumer goods and machinery. Prices of imported computers and
semiconductors fell. For the first quarter of 2000, prices of non-oil imports
increased percent at an annual rate after rising a similar amount in the fourth
quarter of 1999. Prices of imported "core" goods rose 1-1/2 percent at an annual
rate, the third consecutive quarter of price increases. The rise reflected higher
prices for industrial supplies, automotive products, and foods, feeds, and
beverages, which were only partly offset by a swing from increases to decreases
in the prices of machinery and consumer goods.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports continued to rise in March, primarily
accounted for by higher prices of exported "core" goods (which exclude
agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors). The increase was largely
in industrial supplies, with smaller increases in most other major trade
categories. For the first quarter of 2000, prices of "core" goods exports
increased 3-1/4 percent at an annual rate, about the same as in the fourth quarter of
1999, with large increases in the prices of industrial supplies and smaller
increases in the prices of automotive products, machinery, and consumer goods.
Note: Price data for April will be reported in the Greenbook Supplement.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreigners accumulated U.S. securities at a record pace in the first
quarter. (See line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.)
Accompanying this private inflow was a significant inflow of official capital
(line 1).
Although the foreign private sector continued to reduce its holdings of U.S.
Treasuries (line 4a), there were extraordinary increases in its demand for U.S.
corporate bonds, agency bonds, and corporate stocks (lines 4c, 4b, 4d); inflows
in these last two categories set monthly and quarterly records. Net purchases of

IV-6
corporate stocks were concentrated in Europe (totaling $59 billion); Germany
led the way with $16 billion, with lesser, but large, purchases in the United
Kingdom, Switzerland, and Belgium-Luxembourg. In contrast, Japan showed
net sales of $5 billion for the quarter. U.S. corporate bonds were also-purchased
primarily by Europeans, while net purchases of agency bonds were significant
for the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, and Japan. The net sales of Treasuries
in the first quarter (line 4a) were concentrated in Japan and the United Kingdom;
each recorded net sales in excess of $7 billion. All of the total in line 4a was
accounted for by net sales of long-term Treasury securities -instruments with
original maturities of a year or more; private foreigners made small net
purchases of Treasury bills.
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased substantially for the
first quarter, primarily on the basis of inflows in March (line 1). Japanese
foreign-exchange intervention accounted for almost half of the first quarter's
inflow. Korea, Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, and Indonesia also increased their
holdings significantly for the quarter. Preliminary data from the FRBNY
indicate that, despite continued Japanese intervention, foreign official assets fell
moderately in April.
U.S. investors returned to making significant net purchases of foreign securities
in the first quarter (line 5). Net purchases of foreign bonds were concentrated in
Europe, Bermuda and Mexico, while purchases of foreign stocks were strong in
the Caribbean and Asia. In February and March, for the first time in over a year,
U.S. investors purchased European equities; the earlier net sales in Europe likely
reflected a rebalancing of portfolios in response to the acquisition of European
equities in merger-related stock swaps.
The moderate net outflow through banks for the quarter (line 3) was the result of
a large outflow in March offsetting inflows in the first two months of the year.
Partial data for April indicate that the large outflows did not continue.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted nominal exchange value of the dollar has appreciated
substantially since the March FOMC meeting, with our major currencies index
rising 3-1/2 percent and our broad index up 2-1/2 percent. This owed in great part to
a 7 percent appreciation of the dollar against the euro, but the dollar also
appreciated against other major currencies, including 4 percent versus sterling,
3 percent against the Swiss franc and 2 percent vis-à-vis the yen. The dollar
appreciated 1-/4 percent against the currencies of our other important trading
partners.

February March April May
The intensifying weakness of the euro against all other major currencies, even as
euro-area data continued to point to a solid recovery with moderate inflationary
pressures, garnered considerable attention in international financial markets.
Market analysts pointed to the persistent differentials in interest rates and
economic growth rates between the United States and the euro area, to the large
outflows of foreign direct investment from Europe, and to the lack of a united
voice about the single currency among euro-zone officials. The slow pace of
structural reforms in Europe at the national level, particularly in labor and fiscal
policies, and the need for further harmonization and integration were seen by
many as the preeminent underlying causes of the euro's weakness. The
European Central Bank increased its refinancing rate 25 basis points to 3.75
percent on April 27, citing the exchange rate's effect on inflationary pressures as
one of its concerns, but the rate hike did not stem the euro's decline. Late in the
intermeeting period, the euro recovered a bit as market participants focused on

IV-9
the possibility that the European Central Bank may soon intervene for the first
time to support its currency.
The Swiss franc, which had tracked the euro closely since the single currency's
introduction, appreciated 4 percent on net against the euro. Much of the
exchange rate movement came after the chief economist of the Swiss National
Bank indicated that, in part out of concern over rising inflationary pressures, the
bank would let the Swiss franc appreciate versus the euro. The SNB also shifted
its interest rate corridor up 75 basis points; the operating range for the three-
month Swiss LIBOR now stands at 2.5 to 3.5 percent. In the United Kingdom,
where sterling's strength versus the euro has become a preeminent political
issue, the Monetary Policy Committee's decision not to increase the repo rate
after its May 3 meeting came as somewhat of a surprise and was followed by
sterling's depreciation to a four-year low against the dollar.
In Japan, incoming data pointed to a recovery in industrial production but
continued weakness in consumer demand. Japanese monetary authorities
intervened on April 3, the day of the release of the March Tankan survey, which
showed a further improvement in business sector sentiment, purchasing an
extremely large amount of dollars for yen. The intervention appeared to meet
with some success, in that the yen did not return to its pre-intervention level for
the remainder of the intermeeting period.

Headline equity indexes for major industrial countries, shown in the table above,
registered moderate declines in most cases, but indexes with a heavier weighting
towards high-technology issues, not shown, tended to fall more substantially,
following the U.S. Nasdaq. Japan's Nikkel index fell sharply late in the period.
Short-term interest rates increased more than 50 basis points in the euro area and
in Switzerland, and a bit less in Australia and Canada, where policy interest rates
were also raised during the intermeeting period. Ten-year benchmark yields
declined in Japan and Australia, but rose in the other industrial countries.

In Latin America, amid concerns about rising interest rates in the United States,
equity prices fell sharply in major financial centers, led by declines in technology
shares. The Brazilian real depreciated 4 percent against the dollar, in part on
concerns about potential future government liabilities to a workers' insurance

IV-11
fund, and the Mexican peso depreciated almost 3 percent. Dollar-denominated
bond spreads increased substantially in Mexico and Brazil. In emerging Asia,
share prices also fell in several markets, but currencies and interest rates were
generally little changed. Indonesia was an exception; the rupiah depreciated
12 percent, in part as the IMF, citing the slow pace of reform, temporarily
suspended its loan disbursements to the government.

period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the March Greenbook suggest that economic activity in the
foreign industrial countries continued to expand at a healthy pace in the first
quarter. In the euro area, activity remained strong. Recent data in Japan are
consistent with a significant upturn in the first quarter. But, the sustainability of
the recovery remains unclear. In the United Kingdom and Canada, activity
appears to have slowed a bit from a relatively brisk pace experienced in the
fourth quarter.
The lagged effect of the run-up in energy prices has exerted upward pressure on
consumer prices in most foreign industrial countries, but core consumer price
inflation remains subdued. In the euro area, core CPI inflation is running around
1 percent. Moreover, in Germany, there is evidence that the effect of higher
energy prices on consumer prices may have already peaked. In both the United
Kingdom and Canada, consumer price inflation remains low relative to official
targets set by those countries' central banks, while in Japan deflationary
pressures persist.
Since the March Greenbook, both the Bank of Canada and the European Central
Bank raised official interest rates 25 basis points. Officials at both central banks
cited concerns about the possible buildup of inflationary pressures, with the
Europeans putting particular emphasis on the potential inflationary effects of
their currency's depreciation.
In Japan, recent indicators suggest that real GDP rebounded in the first quarter
of this year following a contraction in the second half of last year. The
improvement partly reflects inadequate adjustment for an extra work day owing
to leap year. It also appears to have included some bounceback in areas that
were particularly weak in the fourth quarter. Notably, new car registrations and
housing starts both increased sharply after falling in the two previous quarters.
Nevertheless, household expenditures, a major component of consumption, was
down slightly in the first quarter.
Indicators of business investment, including shipments of machinery and
building construction, have continued the upward trend begun in the middle of
last year. However, public construction contracts fell sharply in the first quarter,
suggesting public investment was weak. Supply-side indicators continued to
expand in the first quarter. Industrial production adjusted for working days rose
1.3 percent in the first quarter, while the broader all-industry index was up about
1 percent for January and February on average relative to the fourth quarter.

IV-13
The Japanese labor market has remained stagnant. The unemployment rate was
unchanged in March at 4.9 percent, an historical high, as corporate restructuring
continues to restrain job growth. The offers-to-applicants ratio edged up to 0.53
in March, still a very low level.
Deflation continues in the prices of most Japanese goods and services as well as
real estate. The core consumer price index in the Tokyo area (which excludes
fresh food but includes energy) was down 0.5 percent in April from a year
earlier, and the GDP deflator fell again in the fourth quarter, recording a year-
over-year decline of 1.5 percent. The wholesale price index for domestic goods
was up 0.5 percent year-over-year in April, partly as a result of higher oil prices.
Posted prices for all categories of land have continued to decline sharply.
Official land prices as of January 1 of this year were down by an average of 4.9
percent from a year earlier, which was the ninth consecutive year of decline.

The BOJ's March Tankan showed another improvement in business confidence,
and firms in most categories expect conditions to continue improving over the
next three months. This survey also provided the first glimpse of expectations
for profits, sales, and capital spending for FY2000, and these were generally
optimistic. Profits are expected to increase 16 percent, following an estimated
14 percent increase in FY1999. Sales are expected to increase 2.5 percent this
year, reversing the FY1999 decline. Capital expenditures are projected to show
a 1 percent decline in FY2000, after falling nearly 11 percent in FY1999.
However, the capital expenditure projections typically are revised upward
throughout the fiscal year as investment plans become more definite, suggesting
that capital expenditures may show some increase in FY2000.
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke on April 2 and remains
in a coma. He was quickly replaced by the ruling LDP's Secretary General,
Yoshiro Mori, who reappointed the full cabinet. No major policy changes are
expected immediately. Mori has in particular reiterated the government's
commitment to assuring that economic recovery is firmly established before
fiscal consolidation is undertaken. However, speculation has mounted that the
timetable for the next Lower House election, which must be held by October,
may be moved up in order for the new government to obtain a popular
endorsement and take advantage of a possible sympathy vote. Recent reports
suggest that the election is likely to be held in June in order to give the new
government a mandate before the July G-7 summit in Okinawa.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first three months of 2000 was $120
billion at an annual rate, up from $115 billion in the same period of the previous
year. Denominated in dollars, exports were up 18 percent from year-ago levels,
largely due to a continuing surge in exports to the developing Asian economies.
Imports were up 24 percent, partly reflecting a jump in the value of oil imports.
In the euro area, recent data suggest that real economic activity remained strong
in the first quarter. Euro-area industrial production rose 1.2 percent (s.a.) in
February after remaining relatively flat in January. In addition, German
industrial production was up 0.8 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter. The overall
economic sentiment index rose again in March after hitting record highs in
January and February and following consistent gains during most of 1999. The
volume of German industry orders rose 0.8 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter.
While domestic orders dropped during the first quarter, foreign orders rose a
robust 2.6 percent.
In March, the harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged further
down to 9.4 percent, its lowest rate since September 1992. In France, Germany

IV-15
and Italy, unemployment rates remain above the euro-area average, although
they continue to decline.
Indicators for the second quarter are very limited, but euro-area economic
sentiment remained at a record high in April. Confidence improved in the
industrial and construction sectors, but remained flat among consumers.

Euro-area consumer prices were up 2.2 percent (n.s.a.) in March from a year
earlier to breach the 2 percent target ceiling set by the European Central Bank
(ECB). Excluding energy prices, however, the twelve-month inflation rate
continued to remain about 1 percent, the same as in both January and December.
In addition, the twelve-month rate of pan-German consumer price inflation
declined to 1.5 percent (s.a.) in April-after climbing steadily in 1999 and the
first three months of 2000 and reaching 1.9 percent in March-suggesting that the

IV-16
pass-through effects of recent oil price increases on consumer prices are
beginning to wane.
On April 28, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised its main refinancing rate
25 basis points to 3.75 percent. The text that accompanied the interest rate
decision expressed the Governing Council's concern about upside risks to price
stability and explicitly linked the level of the exchange rate to these risks. In
four separate moves since early November 1999, the ECB has raised rates by a
total of 125 basis points.

On April 26, Italian President Ciampi swore in Italy's new prime minister,
Giuliano Amato, and his ministers. The new government is widely seen as a
stop-gap administration until the general elections due April 2001.
Incoming data show that the pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom
slowed in the first quarter, with a preliminary estimate of real GDP growth of
1.8 percent (s.a.a.r.). Consumer demand appears to have remained strong as the
volume of retail sales in the first quarter increased at its fastest rate in over two
years. However, industrial production declined 0.8 percent in the first quarter.
Business sentiment declined sharply in April, reflecting weak export orders.
Labor market conditions remained tight in the first quarter. The official claims-
based unemployment rate remained 4.0 percent in March, the lowest rate in 20

IV-17
years, and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate hit a
record low of 5.8 percent for the three months centered in January. Average
annual earnings growth fell to 5.5 percent in February, but this rate is above the
level of 4.5 percent that the Bank of England has suggested is compatible with
its inflation target.

The twelve-month rate of British retail price inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) for March was 2.0 percent, below the 2.5 percent official
target. On an EU-harmonized basis, U.K. consumer price inflation was lower,
registering 0.7 percent in the twelve months to March. Producer input prices,
however, have risen in recent months; in the first quarter producer input prices
rose 12.7 percent from a year earlier.
On May 10, 2000 the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England
released its latest GDP and inflation forecasts in its quarterly Inflation Report.
Under the assumption that official interest rates remain unchanged at 6 percent,
annual GDP growth is expected to ease from its present rate of 3 percent to
around 2 /2 -2 percent, at or above trend, by the first quarter of 2001.
Inflation is projected to remain below target this year and then rise to around the

IV-18
2-1/2 percent target level at the end of the forecast horizon. Underlying this
forecast is the assumption that sterling depreciates by 1.6 percent over the
forecast period. Alternative assumptions for the exchange rate can raise or lower
the inflation profile by up to 1/2 percent at the two-year horizon.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown released the Budget for fiscal year
2000-01 on March 21, 2000. The budget was slightly expansionary in its overall
impact and contained few surprises. For fiscal year 2000-2001, the budget
surplus is forecasted at £14 billion (1.6 percent of GDP), slightly less than the
fiscal year 1999-2000 forecast of £17 (nearly 2 percent of GDP). The economic
forecasts underlying the budget were unchanged from last November's pre-
budget report, and call for somewhat weaker growth this year than most private
sector forecasts.
In Canada, growth slowed somewhat in the first quarter from the fourth
quarter's brisk pace. After continuing to rise sharply in January, real GDP fell
0.4 percent in February, posting the largest monthly decline in two years.
Manufacturing activity, in particular, dropped off significantly in part due to
temporary production shutdowns in the automobile industry. Lower retail sales
and construction activity also contributed to February's decline. However,
February's weakness is likely to be short-lived. Based on an April survey, more
than 80 percent of manufacturers expect that they would produce the same
amount or more in the coming three months than in the previous three months.
Employment also rose a hefty 3.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, the largest
quarterly increase since the third quarter of 1997. Despite the surge in
employment, the unemployment rate in the first quarter remained largely
unchanged at 6.8 percent due to strong labor force growth.
While the twelve-month rate of CPI inflation rose to 3 percent in March, core
CPI inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was 1.5 percent in March,
well within the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent target range. Despite low core
inflation, the Bank of Canada matched the 25 basis point rate increase by the
Federal Reserve by raising its Bank Rate to 5.5 percent on March 22. In
justifying its decision, the Bank continued to emphasize the strong momentum
in the economy and its concern that the economy may be approaching its
capacity limit.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In major Latin American countries, output continued to rise during the first
quarter, but at an uneven pace across countries. Data have pointed to continued
strength in Mexico, but some slowing in the pace of growth in Argentina and
Brazil. Mexican export strength has been driven by the U.S. economy, while in
Brazil a pickup in exports has been fueled by improved international
competitiveness. The net oil exporters (Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela)
have benefitted from high oil prices, while most of the region also has also been
helped by a rise in other commodity prices. Inflation has fallen in Mexico,
Brazil, and Venezuela; in Argentina, consumer prices continued to fall.
In Korea, there are indications of a moderation from the very rapid pace of
growth last year. In Greater China, activity so far this year has remained robust,
led primarily by strong export growth. In the ASEAN region, after a strong
fourth quarter, output indicators for most of the economies in the region have
been mixed. Inflationary pressures have remained at bay in much of the region.
On April 19, the IMF approved a $304 million three-year stand-by arrangement
for Ecuador. Ecuador will also receive an additional $1.7 billion in loans from
other international organizations over the next three years, assuming all IMF
program performance criteria are met. Official dollarization of Ecuador's
economy was institutionalized by the passage of the Economic Transformation
Law in mid-March. The central bank's liquid international reserves have
stabilized since then, and more prices are being quoted in dollars. Dollars have
been gradually replacing sucre notes, and the legislation stipulates that sucre
notes will be retired from circulation within the next few months. However,
some economists in Ecuador have criticized the government's dollarization
plans, and the person expected to preside over the Dollarization Commission
resigned in early May. The government nonetheless reiterated its determination
to implement its dollarization plan. Ecuador resumed talks to restructure its
privately held foreign debt in early May.
In Brazil, real GDP rose 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, more than most
observers had expected. The quarterly figures for 1999 was revised sharply,
including an upward revision in Q4 growth from 5.8 to 9.4 percent. Although
the latest data should be viewed with caution, the results are consistent with
other evidence of continued growth in the first quarter. Imports grew 8.5 percent
over the twelve-month period through April, boosted by higher oil prices and
rapid growth in imports of intermediate goods. Over the same period, exports
rose 13 percent, led by growth in manufactured exports.

IV-24
Inflation has fallen according to most price indices, pulled down by declines in
food prices and tight monetary policy. Consumer prices declined in the months
of February and March on a seasonally adjusted basis. Partly as a result of these
developments, in late March, Brazil's central bank reduced its target overnight
interbank rate (the Selic) from 19 percent to 18.5 percent, the first rate decrease
since September 1999. The move also followed the government's decision to
set the annual increase in the minimum wage at 11 percent, less than many had
feared. Brazil's government recorded a higher-than-expected fiscal surplus over
the January-February period, ensuring that it will meet its IMF program target
for the first quarter of 2000. In early April, Brazil's government repaid over
$10 billion in emergency loans from the IMF and bilateral creditors (under the
BIS-Japanese government loan facility) that had been granted as part of an
international rescue package cobbled together in late 1998.

Nonetheless, since late March, Brazilian asset prices have declined somewhat,
pulled down by turmoil in U.S. equity markets and by domestic pressures. In
early April, it became apparent that the government will face an additional 2 to
7 percent of GDP in liabilities associated with special workers' savings
accounts, pending a court ruling expected later this month. Furthermore,
members of the coalition of parties supporting President Cardoso pressured for a
more generous minimum wage hike in early 2001, raising doubts about the
political and popular support for fiscal and monetary conservatism. In response

IV-25
to the adverse internal and external developments, in mid-April, the central bank
removed the downward bias on the Selic.
In Mexico, both domestic demand and external indicators remained strong in the
past quarter. Retail sales rose over 16 percent in February on a twelve-month
basis and exports were up 25 percent in the first quarter from their year-ago
value. Industrial production fell in February from the previous month, but this
followed an especially strong performance in January, and was still 9.7 percent
above its year-earlier level. Strong exports, largely driven by a booming U.S.
economy, have led to a narrowing of the trade deficit. There is no evidence that
strong economic activity is fueling inflationary pressures; the twelve-month
inflation rate, as well as survey data on twelve-month ahead inflation
expectations, have continued on their downward trajectories in recent months.

The Mexican senate unanimously approved a new bankruptcy bill in late April,
paving the way for President Zedillo to sign it into law. Some analysts argue
that the new law, which strengthens rights of creditors, will increase banks'
willingness to grant loans and induce shareholders to inject more capital into the
banks, thus revitalizing the ailing banking system. On the political front, the
lead held by Francisco Labastida, the presidential candidate of the ruling party
(PRI), in the polls over his main rival, Vincente Fox of the National Action Party

IV-26
(PAN), has almost disappeared. With the July 2 presidential elections less than
two months away, the two top candidates are locked in an extremely tight race.
In Argentina, data released since the last Greenbook show some slackening in
the pace of recovery following a burst in output growth in the fourth quarter.
GDP growth posted an 8.2 percent jump (s.a.a.r.) in the last quarter of 1999
supported by strong industnal production. In the first quarter, however,
industrial production rose only 1.2 percent (s.a.), compared with almost
5 percent in the fourth quarter. Other signs point to sluggish demand as well,
including anemic growth in income tax revenues, weak import growth, and
continued declines in consumer prices. On the positive side, economic strength
in Brazil, continued high oil prices, and the steady recovery of some key
commodity prices have boosted exports.

President de la Rua managed to push controversial labor market reform through
the senate in late April. To become law, the bill needs final approval in the
house, which is expected some time in May. Over the long run, this reform is
expected to increase labor market flexibility by reducing employers' firing costs
and social security contributions and by weakening union control.
Developments in Venezuela have been mixed since the last Greenbook. Car
sales hit a 20-month high in March, following gains in January and February and
the government reported that manufacturing production increased in the first

IV-27
quarter. However, consumer price inflation stayed steady at 18 percent over the
twelve months ending in April, the lowest rate in over a decade, apparently
indicating continued weakness in domestic demand. High oil prices boosted the
current account balance in the fourth quarter, but the non-oil trade balance fell
sharply, reflecting the sizeable real appreciation of the currency. Venezuela will
hold elections for almost all political offices, including the presidency, on
May 28. President Chavez now faces some competition from Arias Cardenas, a
former ally. Political uncertainty about the elections continues to paralyze
policymaking and depress Venezuelan asset prices.

In Korea, recent activity data have been somewhat mixed, but on balance appear
to suggest continued strong growth. Real GDP posted its fourth straight double-
digit growth rate in the fourth quarter. This increase was entirely accounted for
by growth of domestic demand. Much of domestic demand growth was
attributable to a swing to positive inventory investment; consumption rose, but
fixed investment declined slightly for the second consecutive quarter. After
increasing sharply in January, industrial production declined in both February
and March, possibly indicating a moderation in the rapid pace of growth.
However, the unemployment rate declined further in those two months. Recent
data give no indication of a pickup in inflation.

Reflecting the strength of domestic demand, the trade surplus for the first quarter
of this year declined to less than half its year-ago level. Over this period, export
growth was strong (over 30 percent) but import growth was even faster (surging
over 60 percent), fueled by strong domestic demand. As the trade surplus has
declined, officials have expressed concern that further appreciations of the won
could weaken the price competitiveness of Korean goods. Consistent with this
concern, the authorities have been intervening to hold down the won. This has
contributed to the continued rise in foreign exchange reserves, currently over
$80 billion, compared with a low of less than $10 billion at the end of 1997.
In the ASEAN region, Thailand registered strong fourth-quarter growth, adding
to the already strong fourth quarter picture for the region. However, recent
industrial production figures for the ASEAN countries have given a mixed
picture of first quarter performance. While Malaysian industrial production
continued to rise, for the other countries, monthly movements in industrial
production have been volatile. The recent trade data for ASEAN were also
choppier than usual, although the general picture that emerges is one of
continued strength in exports. Despite the overall strength of the ongoing
regional recovery, inflation remains subdued across the region.
In early April, the Paris Club agreed to reschedule $5.8 billion of Indonesia's
foreign debt. The accord covered outstanding debt due over the period between
end-March 2000 and end-March 2002, exceeding expectations that only the

IV-29
$2.1 billion due in 2000 would be rescheduled. The agreement will enter into
force upon the approval by the IMF board of the first review under Indonesia's
IMF program, which is expected by early June 2000.

In mid-March, Thai Petrochemicals Industry (TPI), Thailand's largest debtor,
was declared insolvent after failing to service its debt for over two years. This
court case was the first significant action brought by a creditor against a large
corporate debtor under the newly amended Thai bankruptcy laws and is seen as
an important test case. By increasing the pressure on debtors, market analysts
expect that the new law will hasten the resolution of the country's large stock of
non-performing loans.
In China, real GDP rose 9.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, boosted by a
large increase in exports, although some recovery in private consumption also
contributed to growth. Exports rose 21 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, driven
by recovery elsewhere in Asia. Imports grew even more sharply, rising
45 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, reflecting the high import content of Chinese
exports as well as some strengthening in private domestic demand; as a result,
the trade surplus has narrowed. Deflationary pressures have eased in the face of
stronger economic activity and higher oil prices; consumer prices were roughly
unchanged in March on a twelve-month basis.
In April, China's central bank announced its intention to move toward a more
market-based system of interest rates, although no specific details or time frame
were mentioned. (Interest rates in China remain well below U.S. levels.)
Inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have recovered somewhat in recent
months, partially reflecting expectations that China will soon enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO). For example, contracted FDI inflows rose
20 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier. However,
bilateral agreements on China's accession to the WTO are still under negotiation
with the European Union and some other WTO member states. The U.S.
Congress is scheduled to vote on a related bill to grant China Permanent Normal
Trading Relations (PNTR) during the week of May 22.

In Hong Kong, recent data suggest that economic activity remained robust.
Exports rose 8 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, aided by a pickup in trade flows
to and from mainland China. Imports also rose sharply, however, with the trade
deficit remaining roughly unchanged. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent
(s.a.) in the January-March period, down from 6.0 percent in the October-
December period. Weakness in the property market and a price war among
retailers continued to contain inflationary pressures; consumer prices in March
were roughly flat on a seasonally adjusted basis, bringing the twelve-month
decline to 5 percent. In late March, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised
the base rate it charges at its discount window 25 basis points to 7.5 percent.

In Taiwan, economic activity continued to expand at a rapid pace. Industrial
production in March rose 4.4 percent (s.a.), driven by strong growth in the
electronics and information technology sectors. Stronger domestic demand and
rising oil prices caused consumer prices to edge up further through April,
although the twelve-month rate of inflation remained low. In late March, Chen
Shui-bian, leader of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
won the presidential election, ending more than half a century of Nationalist
Party rule. The Chinese government's response to the election outcome was
relatively restrained. Also in late March, the central bank raised its rediscount
rate to 4.625 percent from 4.5 percent, the first increase since July 1997.

In Russia, GDP rebounded robustly in 1999, supported by a recovery in
domestic demand and high oil prices. Industrial production in the first quarter
rose nearly 2 percent (n.s.a.), and twelve-month consumer price inflation has
decreased to 22 percent. In late March, Vladimir Putin won the presidential
election in the first round, and took office May 7. Although Putin has not fully
articulated his views on economic policy, he has emphasized the need for fiscal
and structural reforms.
