Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The pace of economic expansion appears to have slowed in the current quarter.
Consumers, whose spending soared in the winter, increased their outlays for
goods rather modestly this spring, and home purchases and starts seem to be
subsiding; equipment outlays, though still strong, have decelerated after a
Y2K-related surge in the first quarter. However, whether private demand has
moved decisively onto a more moderate expansion track is not yet clear.
Meanwhile, core consumer prices continue to evidence some tendency toward
acceleration, reflecting in part the sustained tightness of the labor market and the
ongoing pass-through of the sharp increase in petroleum prices over the past
year.
Labor Market Developments
The employment report for May was surprisingly weak. While Census hiring
led to an overall increase in nonfarm payroll employment, private employment
fell 116,000, with the declines spread widely across industries. Aggregate hours
of private production or nonsupervisory workers fell sharply in May, implying
an appreciable drop in the average workweek. In the household survey, as well,
there was a notable decline in employment, and the unemployment rate rose to
4.1 percent.
Given the absence of evidence elsewhere that labor demand has slackened
noticeably, we are inclined to attribute the striking downswing in the May labor
report mainly to statistical noise and seasonal adjustment problems.
Recognizing the noise in the monthly numbers, it makes sense to look at them
on a moving average basis: The May drop came on the heels of very large gains
in the preceding two months, so that private payroll growth averaged 185,000 in
the March-May span, close to the 190,000 average of the prior twelve-months.
As for seasonal considerations, first, the reference period fell early in the month
and may have failed to capture some of the rising employment that the seasonal
factors expect at this time of year.' Second, a shortage of workers may have
inhibited normal hiring; the seasonal adjustment factors anticipate a particularly
large gain in jobs in May. Alternatively, firms may have done their seasonal
hiring earlier than usual--possibly in anticipation of intense competition for
workers--and this could have contributed to the strong employment growth in
March and April. Third, in an already tight labor market, the large amount of
Census hiring may have drained some workers away from the private sector.
1. The BLS's seasonal adjustment procedures attempt to correct the payroll employment
data for the timing of reference periods, but any given configuration of the calendar is
sufficiently uncommon to render these corrections imprecise. Data from the household survey
are not corrected for the timing of reference periods. This is probably not important for the
unemployment rate, which exhibits no strong seasonality at this time of year. But May is a
month of large flows into the labor force, and much of last month's decline in the labor force
participation rate may be attributable to this source.

As noted, most other indicators of labor demand have yet to show appreciable
weakening. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved up since
April, but recent levels are similar to those we saw at the beginning of the year,
when employment was increasing quite rapidly. The Conference Board and
Michigan SRC surveys indicate that households continue to be fairly upbeat
about employment prospects. From the employers' perspective, the latest
reading on net hiring strength from Manpower's Employment Outlook Survey
hit a record high, although a measure from the National Federation of
Independent Businesses has dropped back some this year.2 A second NFIB
indicator--"positions hard to fill"--held at a record high in May,3 and similar
measures from the Bureau of National Affairs continue to point to a tight labor
market.
BLS now reports that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an
annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first quarter of 2000. As we have noted before,
the estimates of first-quarter nonfarm productivity growth were held down by
shifts in the timing of payments to defense contractors.4 Adjusting for this
anomaly and small expected downward revisions to output and hours implied by
the incoming data, nonfarm business productivity probably increased at an
annual rate of about 4 percent in the first quarter and about 3.9 percent over the
past four quarters.
The BLS report also included a preliminary estimate of productivity in the
nonfinancial corporate sector for the first quarter of 2000. Output per hour in
this sector rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter and
4 percent over the four quarter quarters ended in 2000:Q1.5 Over the past few
years, productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector has increased, on
average, about 1 percentage point per year faster than in the nonfarm business
sector.
2. Although the latest Manpower survey results refer to the third quarter, historically the
index, which began in 1976, has been more informative about the quarter in which the survey
took place--in this case, the second quarter.
3. This NFIB series began in 1986.
4. A Y2K-related speed-up in payments to defense contractors boosted defense spending in
the fourth quarter of 1999, and the subsequent "payback" depressed spending in the first quarter
of 2000. We estimate that these anomalies raised measured productivity growth in the nonfarm
business sector in the fourth quarter by 0.6 percentage point, depressed it in the first quarter by
1.2 percentage points, and will boost it again in the second quarter by 0.6 percentage point.
5. The defense spending anomaly probably did not distort the nonfinancial corporate figures.
The latter are measured on the income side of the national accounts, and defense vendors most
likely booked the early federal payments in the first quarter, when the services were actually
rendered--in line with generally accepted accounting principles.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls rose just 0.1 percent in May after a 0.4 percent increase in
April. Over the twelve months ended in May, hourly earnings rose 3.5 percent,
a rate similar to the 3.6 percent increase over the preceding twelve months.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector as calculated using NIPA
estimates of worker compensation--a broader measure of labor costs than
average hourly earnings--rose 4.3 percent over the four quarters ended 2000:Q1,
compared with a 5.2 percent increase over the preceding four-quarter period.
The first-quarter figure was revised only slightly from its earlier estimate, but
BEA will have more opportunities to adjust the numbers in coming months as
they receive additional data from unemployment insurance records.
Industrial Production
Manufacturing production increased 0.3 percent in May after a rise of
0.6 percent in April. The average gain for April and May fell below the average
monthly gain of 0.6 percent in the first quarter, and available forward-looking
indicators for the manufacturing sector point to even a bit slower pace of growth
in the months ahead.

Motor vehicle production has increased in the current quarter. Assemblies in
April and May averaged 13.3 million units (annual rate), up from the
13.1 million pace recorded in the first quarter. The increase in production has
occurred as sales of cars and light trucks have eased, allowing inventories to be
rebuilt after reaching unusually low levels in the first quarter: Days' supply for
light vehicles overall, which had fallen to 54 in February, was at the comfortable
level of 63 in May. Looking ahead, assembly schedules for the third quarter call
for production of 13.7 million units, but substantial underbuilds are likely
because of the large number of new models being introduced during the model
changeovers this summer.6 In addition, although inventories are generally in
good shape, there are a few pockets of imbalances and some production cuts
have been announced.
Measured output growth in the high-tech sector has stepped down in recent
months but is still rapid. The output of semiconductor manufacturers, the stellar
performers in the industrial sector so far this year, zoomed in February and
March, increasing about 10 percent each month in response to exceptionally
heavy demand. The rate of increase tapered off somewhat in April and May as
fabrication plants started to hit capacity constraints--estimated capacity
utilization is running above 100 percent. These supply constraints are placing
upward pressure on prices for semiconductors and have also led to shortages for
certain types of chips. However, as of yet, there are only a few reports of chip
6. On an FRB basis, if the underbuilds were to materialize, assemblies likely would show a
decline, but the BEA estimates, which are produced with a considerably different set of seasonal
factors, could well show an increase.

shortages holding back production in other industries producing electronic
goods.
In response to the surge in demand, investment in semiconductor plants has
been picking up. We now estimate that domestic semiconductor capacity,
measured in quality-adjusted terms, will increase 84 percent this year.7
However, most of the additional capacity generated by this year's investment
will not come on line until next year. Thus, the short-term outlook appears to be
for a continued tight market for semiconductors.
Production of aircraft and parts has continued to decline, although more slowly
than earlier in the year, as the step-down in production at Boeing has moderated.
Growth in manufacturing output outside of the high-tech, motor vehicle, and
aircraft sectors has slowed. The production of nondurables has edged down
slightly this year after surging late last year.

II-11
Looking ahead, indicators point to a continuation in the coming months of more
moderate increases in manufacturing activity than earlier this year. The
diffusion index for new orders from the National Association of Purchasing
Management--though still positive--has eased somewhat. Excluding electronic
components, durable goods orders also paint a picture of a moderate slowing in
the growth of manufacturing production in the months ahead. The sharp drop in
the staff s series on real adjusted durable goods orders in April should be
discounted because it largely reflected an anomalous plunge in orders for
semiconductors, an area in which underlying demand is soaring and for which
orders were up sharply in the preceding months.
Consumer Spending and Income
After several quarters of outsized gains--including a first-quarter surge of
7-1/2 percent at an annual rate--real consumer spending appears headed for a
much smaller increase in the current quarter. The drop-back is not surprising
given the fading impetus from earlier wealth gains and the possibility that
consumers need a breather. The underlying fundamentals have remained
relatively favorable--although stock prices have been essentially unchanged on
balance this year, income has continued to advance solidly and sentiment
remains very positive.
Sales of light vehicles in May, adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, were
17.5 million units (annual rate), up 400,000 units from April but more than
3 percent below the blistering first-quarter pace. The latest readings on
consumer attitudes about purchasing a new vehicle are still in a favorable range,
and overall industry incentives remain high.
Nominal retail sales in the control group of stores, which excludes automotive
dealers and building material and supply outlets, increased 0.2 percent in May
after having edged down 0.1 percent in April. Large increases in sales were
posted at apparel, general merchandise, and drug stores in May, but spending
fell at furniture and appliance dealers, food stores, and restaurants. Sales at
stores in the "other durable goods" category and at gasoline service stations
registered moderate increases, although Department of Energy data indicate that
real purchases of gasoline fell somewhat last month.
Translating the data on retail sales and unit sales of light vehicles, we
estimate that, after having risen at a whopping 9-3/4 percent annual rate over the
past two quarters, real consumer purchases of goods in April and May were little
changed, on average, from their first-quarter level. Growth in spending has
slowed in all of the major aggregates of goods. In contrast, the trend in real
outlays for services has remained fairly steady: April's increase was just a shade
below the strong 1/2 percent average monthly increase recorded during the first
quarter and about the same as the pace of growth during 1999. In keeping with

recent trends, recreational services, telephone services, and personal care
services all rose at robust rates in April.
Disposable personal income appears to be rising at a solid pace so far this
quarter. The employment report for May points to a decline in private wage and
salary disbursements in that month. However, this drop comes on the heels of a
1 percent surge in April, and we estimate that the average level of nominal
private wage and salary disbursements in April and May was above the
first-quarter level by about 1-1/2 percent (not at an annual rate). The Wilshire
5000 index is still near its value at the end of last year, so unless stock prices
jump over the next week, household net worth should show little net gain over
the first half of this year.5
The available information from consumer surveys suggests that confidence has
remained extremely high. However, the early reading of the Michigan SRC
index of consumer sentiment did show a small drop, reflecting deteriorations in
all but one of the five components.
Housing Markets
Recent indicators suggest that housing activity may finally be weakening, as the
effects of higher mortgage rates apparently have begun to outweigh the boost
from increases in income and wealth that has supported demand for some time.
Starts of single-family houses, which were 1.33 million in 1999 and ran at about
the same pace in the first four months of this year, slipped to an annual rate of
1.25 million in May. Adjusted permits for these units also declined over the
past two months, suggesting that the drop in starts is not a statistical fluke.
Sales of new single-family homes have yet to show a slackening, having
averaged 928,000 (annual rate) during the first four months of this year,
2-1/2 percent more than the 1999 level. By contrast, existing home sales during
the January-April period, at an annual rate of 482,000, were 7-1/4 percent below
their 1999 average.
More timely indicators of single-family activity point to continued slowing.
Builders' ratings of new home sales declined in June and have slumped
significantly during the past year or so. According to the Michigan survey,
consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions also have deteriorated
5. In the flow of funds accounts, household balance sheets are valued on an end-of-quarter
basis.

sharply, with increasing numbers of households citing higher mortgage rates and
higher house prices as reasons why it is a bad time to buy.6
The average price of existing homes was up 6.2 percent in April from a year
earlier. The year-over-year change in Freddie Mac's repeat sales index, which
measures sales of the same units over time, was unchanged in the first quarter
but was up 6.7 percent on a year-over-year basis. The average price of new
homes in April was up 8.7 percent from a year earlier. However, the
constant-quality new home price index posted a year-over-year increase of only
1.9 percent in the first quarter.
Recent data on builders' costs show an end to the acceleration over the past few
years: The employment cost index for construction workers rose 3.8 percent
during the twelve months ended in March--the same as in the year-earlier
period--and the twelve-month change in the producer price index for
construction materials has been hovering in the 2 percent range for about a year.
Moreover, the most recent indicators point to a considerable softening in the
costs of builders' materials: The PPI for construction materials declined in
May, and spot prices for lumber have fallen over the past month.
In the multifamily sector, starts were at an annual rate of 342,000 units in May,
continuing to run above the average level in 1999. However, May starts were
somewhat high relative to permits, suggesting that starts of these units will
moderate in June.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Smoothing through the recent fluctuations
associated with the century date change, there is scant evidence that capital
expenditures have begun slowing in response to higher interest rates or a less
favorable stock market. To the contrary, real expenditures on equipment and
software appear likely to advance at a rapid pace again in the second quarter.
The strength reflects continued positive investment fundamentals. Business
6. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) index of applications for mortgages to
purchase homes has continued its upward trend--seemingly at odds with the indicators that
suggest that housing activity has begun to weaken. However, we are inclined to discount the
high level of applications because the series appears to contain an upward trend that greatly
exceeds that of total home sales. One factor underlying this divergence is that the MBA sample
consists mainly of large, national lenders. During the past decade the industry has been
consolidated, so the share of total originations captured by the MBA sample has trended up over
time. A second factor is that the incidence of multiple applications has increased as application
fees have declined, and it has become more common for buyers to get pre-approved by one
lender but borrow from another. Given that trends in these factors are unlikely to be stable over
time, the MBA index is not likely to be especially helpful in identifying turning points in the
housing market.

output has continued to expand briskly, and the user cost of capital has actually
been fairly flat over the past year, as declining relative prices for equipment
have offset the effects of rising interest rates. In addition, while a cooling IPO
market and high yields on junk bonds may be restricting capital expenditures for
some firms, bank lending and corporate cash flow have been ample, suggesting
that financing has not been a problem for most firms.
Real business expenditures on computing equipment appear headed for another
large advance in the second quarter. The capacity constraints in chip production
do not seem to be cutting into business purchases of computing equipment as of
yet, although computer prices are falling more slowly than their trend of recent
years. Nominal shipments of computing equipment surged 11 percent in April
(not at an annual rate) after a 7-1/2 percent increase in the first quarter.
Anecdotal reports suggest that business demand for servers and PCs is picking
up again after having been damped in the first quarter by the continuation of
Y2K "lockdowns" at some firms through the early part of the year. Software
spending, which tends to move with hardware expenditures, is also likely to
expand apace in the current quarter.
The outlook for spending on communications equipment continues to be
decidedly upbeat. Shipments were up 3 percent in April after having risen
14 percent in the first quarter. Bookings also increased smartly in April, and the
backlog of unfilled orders--which had increased nearly 27 percent in the
preceding six months--rose further. Telecommunications carriers appear to be
spending heavily in order to expand their networks' abilities to carry increasing
loads of data traffic. Equipment providers report that the fastest growth of
orders is in optical networking equipment: As the need for bandwidth expands,
optical fiber--which can carry data at far higher transfer rates and for much
greater distances than copper wire can--is increasingly in demand.
In contrast to high-tech equipment, business demand for motor vehicles has
weakened. Sales of light vehicles to fleets (confidential) have changed little so
far this quarter, and medium and heavy trucks sales are off sharply, continuing
the downward trend that has been evident since early this year. Most of the
slowing in sales has been in heavy trucks, and the recent slump in orders points
to a further weakening in sales in the months ahead. The softness in demand
appears to reflect problems in the trucking industry, for which profits have
fallen because of higher costs for fuel and insurance and drivers have become
scarce. Industry contacts also report that an overexpansion of fleets of new
trucks has resulted in a large inventory overhang of used trucks, which has
pushed prices down.
The near-term outlook for domestic outlays on aircraft appears positive. While
the strike-related slump in aircraft shipments in February and March mainly

affected deliveries to foreign carriers, it did hold down the rise in domestic
spending on aircraft to some degree. The recovery in shipments by Boeing is
turning out to be speedier than the company had expected. According to
delivery data for May (provided by Boeing), all but a couple of the planes held
in inventory during the strike were delivered by the end of last month, and
business expenditures on aircraft appear set for a substantial gain in the current
quarter.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, nominal shipments of
nondefense capital goods fell 2.7 percent in April. However, this decline
followed a 6.4 percent increase in March, and the level of shipments in April
stood slightly above the first-quarter average. Moreover, the recent trend in
orders has been very positive, and backlogs of unfilled orders are running at
high levels across a number of categories, suggesting a robust outlook for
shipments in the coming months. For example, shipments of special industrial
machinery jumped in April, a trend that seems likely to continue because the
level of unfilled orders in this sector has increased 20 percent so far this year.7
Elsewhere, even though shipments of engines and turbines also climbed in
April, manufacturers managed to work down only a small fraction of the huge
backlog of orders accumulated over the preceding two years.
Nonresidential structures. Outlays for nonresidential structures, which
declined almost 4 percent last year, increased at an annual rate of 22 percent in
the first quarter, with strong gains across all the major categories. Non-
residential construction put-in-place in April was about 3-1/2 percent above the
first-quarter average, suggesting that spending will rise further in the current
quarter.
The reason for the first-quarter surge in investment in nonresidential structures
is not entirely clear. However, spending in this sector was surprisingly weak in
1999, and, given the strength in aggregate demand, some bounceback was
overdue. In addition, good weather may have boosted construction a bit early in
the year, although there is little statistical evidence that weather generally has a
strong effect on this type of construction. Still, the fundamentals do not seem
robust enough to support further gains as large as that seen in the first quarter.
In the office sector, property values were up only 1 percent in the first quarter
relative to a year earlier, and rent increases have been running well below the
peak reached in 1998; vacancy rates, however, are at low levels. Although
increases in prices and rents for retail space have been relatively flat for the past
year or so, they are down substantially from the peaks in the second half of 1998
and first half of 1999. Increases in warehouse prices also have slowed
7. The special industrial machinery category includes printing and woodworking machinery
and equipment used to manufacture textiles, food products, and paper.

II-27
substantially over the past year or so, although rent increases have been
maintained over this period.
Business Inventories
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories (excluding motor
vehicles) increased at an annual rate of $42 billion in April, down from the
$51 billion pace posted in the first quarter. Stockbuilding was concentrated in
the manufacturing and wholesale sectors; inventories dropped sharply at non-
auto retailers. Total shipments and sales fell in April, and aggregate inventory-
to-sales ratios jumped in a few categories--perhaps because of negative surprises
to demand. However, ratios appeared to be at fairly comfortable levels in most
sectors: Responses to last month's surveys of the National Association of
Purchasing Management and the National Federation of Independent Businesses
suggested that firms are fairly satisfied with their levels of inventories.
In manufacturing, inventories increased at an annual rate of $25 billion in April,
up slightly from the $22 billion pace posted in the first quarter. Aircraft
inventories declined at a $6 billion rate in April as a result of the step-up in
Boeing deliveries. Outside of the aircraft industry, inventories rose at a robust
$30 billion rate, led by sizable stockbuilding at manufacturers of electrical
machinery. This buildup was concentrated in the semiconductor industry, in
which demand is booming and inventory-shipments ratios have been falling. In
most other manufacturing categories, stocks also seem to be well aligned with
shipments.
The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an
annual rate of $24 billion in April. Professional and commercial equipment
distributors--the category that includes computer distributors--accumulated
stocks at a $6 billion pace after having liquidated inventories by about twice that
amount over the preceding two months. Inventories held by wholesalers of
metals rose at a $4 billion pace in April, and the inventory-sales ratio in this
sector has increased quite a bit in recent months. Apparently, steel service
centers were overly optimistic about second-quarter sales, and survey evidence
from the Steel Service Center Institute now indicates that 45 percent of these
centers believe their inventories are too high. Wholesale inventories and sales
in most other sectors appeared to be balanced.
The book value of retail inventories (excluding automobile dealerships) dropped
$7 billion in April after having increased at a $7 billion rate in the first quarter.
Nondurable goods inventories fell at an $11 billion pace in April. The drop was
led by a $7 billion reduction in stocks held by retailers in the "other
nondurables" grouping, a category that includes gasoline service stations; the
book-value decline likely reflects at least in part the April drop in gasoline
prices. Nonetheless, by all reports, gasoline stocks are quite lean over the

production chain as a whole--particularly for the reformulated blends required to
meet air quality standards. In other categories, lumber and building materials
retailers accumulated stocks at an $8 billion pace in April; sales dropped
3-3/4 percent, and the inventory-sales ratio jumped up to the highest level in
about four years.
Government
Federal. The federal unified budget surplus has continued to expand, as a
robust increase in receipts has more than offset an acceleration in outlays. The
combined surplus for April and May was $156 billion, $66 billion more than in
April-May 1999.
The recent performance of receipts has been extraordinary. Collections in April
and May were up 21 percent over a year earlier, lifting the total for the twelve
months ending in May 10-1/2 percent above the total for the preceding twelve
months. Three factors account for much of this strength. First, there was
another surge in nonwithheld taxes this spring (we now estimate that individual
income tax liabilities rose about 12 percent in 1999, compared with a rise of
6-1/2 percent in the NIPA measure of taxable personal income). Second,
withheld income and payroll taxes have continued to rise rapidly this year,
outstripping the growth in NIPA wages and salaries by a wide margin and
implying a sharp increase in the effective tax rate. In addition, net corporate tax
collections have risen substantially of late, consistent with the corporate income
data.
April and May outlays, adjusted for certain payment timing shifts, were
7-1/2 percent above a year earlier. Outlays for the most recent twelve months
are 4-1/2 percent above the previous period; this pace is more than 1 percentage
point faster than that seen in recent years. Much of the acceleration comes from
a pickup in defense spending that reflects the lagged effects of a substantial
boost in defense budget authority approved for fiscal 1999. In addition,
agriculture spending has surged over the past twelve months because of
"temporary" subsidy payments. Agricultural subsidies will likely remain
elevated for some time, as another round of payments was enacted in June. The
key features of the new agriculture legislation are an expansion of the crop
insurance program by $8 billion over five years, a $5-1/2 billion increase in
agriculture subsidies for fiscal 2000, and a $1-1/2 billion further boost to
subsidies for fiscal 2001.
State and local. Incoming data for the second quarter point to a deceleration in
state and local purchases after considerable strength in the preceding two
quarters. Spending growth in the current quarter has been held down by
construction activity, which was 2.3 percent lower in April on a seasonally

adjusted basis than its first-quarter average, as mild weather early in the year
had allowed for more highway work than usual in the first quarter. More
generally, state and local construction spending is being boosted this year by the
strong fiscal condition of most governments, the continuing need to expand and
repair infrastructure, and higher federal grants for highways.
Most states will begin the 2001 fiscal year on July 1. Almost all of the states are
expected to have their budgets in place on time this year. As in the past six
years, it appears that most states are finishing fiscal 2000 in better shape than
they had projected at the start of the year, largely because of higher-than-
expected revenue growth, and once again many states enacted tax cuts during
their spring legislative sessions.
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in May after showing no change in
April; headline CPI inflation was held down in April and May by apparently
transitory declines in energy prices. However, over the twelve months ended in
May, the CPI rose 3.1 percent, 1 percentage point more than over the preceding
twelve-month period; faster energy price inflation accounted for much of this
acceleration. Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in both April
and May and was up 2.4 percent over the twelve months ended in May. On a
current-methods basis, the twelve-month change in the core CPI has increased
0.5 percentage point over the past year; excluding tobacco as well as food and
energy items, the acceleration over the past twelve months is 0.6 percentage
point.
Energy prices remain of particular importance in explaining recent and
prospective inflation developments. After having jumped more than 10 percent
(not at an annual rate) over the first three months of the year, consumer energy
prices turned down in April and May by almost 4 percent, in total. On balance,
the CPI for energy is up nearly 15 percent over the past twelve months. The
April and May energy price declines were concentrated in gasoline and heating
fuel, reflecting both the temporary March downturn in crude oil costs and, in
May, the restoration of refinery activity following disruptions that had curtailed
early April production. However, survey data for early June point to a
substantial jump in gasoline prices this month. The recent gasoline price
increases reflect the rebound in crude oil prices as well as fears that low
inventory levels--combined with the very limited ability of foreign producers to
meet new standards for reformulated gasoline in the United States--could lead to
shortages this summer. These fears have boosted margins notably in recent
weeks.
Consumer prices for natural gas rose further in April and May and are up more
than 7 percent (not at an annual rate) so far this year, reflecting the interaction of

strong demand and inelastic short-run supply. Inventories have been reduced to
quite low levels, and, with market participants anticipating only slow rebuilding
of these stocks, spot prices have risen sharply in recent weeks. Many utilities
cannot pass the full extent of these price increases through to the consumer level
immediately; nevertheless, if spot markets do not soften, the eventual pass-
through will likely boost consumer gas prices further in the coming months.
Consumer electricity prices have remained quiescent on balance in recent
months, but, as with natural gas, fuel adjustment charges may lead to a gradual
upturn in the pace of price increases in this sector as well--despite increased
competition associated with more widespread deregulation.
Consumer food price increases have remained relatively subdued. Food prices
rose 0.5 percent in May after increasing 0.1 percent in both March and April.
The May increase reflected a jump in the erratic prices of fruits and vegetables
as well as a further sizable increase in the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs
category. Although we expect increased livestock production to begin to hold
down meat prices later this summer, prices in this sector are likely to show a
substantial increase for the year as a whole. Overall, food prices have increased
2-1/4 percent over the past twelve months, not much different from the rise in
the core index. Looking forward, ample rainfall in the Midwest has calmed
market participants' fears about crop conditions this summer. As a result, spot
commodity prices for most major crops have declined in recent weeks; indeed,
corn prices are nearly back to their lows of last autumn, although soybean prices
remain somewhat elevated.
Outside of the food and energy areas, an acceleration in consumer prices is
evident both in commodities (excluding tobacco) and services. Core commodity
prices were unchanged in May and were up 0.7 percent on a twelve-month basis,
about the same as the increase over the preceding period. However, excluding
tobacco prices, which had increased especially sharply over the earlier period,
core commodity prices have accelerated about 1/2 percentage point over the past
year. Although prices of new vehicles edged up for a third month in May, they
remain soft overall. However, consumer prices of used vehicles have
accelerated noticeably over the past year, and prices have been rising more
rapidly as well for a range of other consumer goods. The CPI for non-energy
services increased 0.2 percent in May--a little below its average over the past
few months--but is up 3 percent over the past year and 1/4 percentage point
above its year-earlier increase. Shelter prices rose 0.3 percent last month and
have increased about 3 percent over the past twelve months, the same as over
the preceding period. In contrast, prices of medical services have been rising
more rapidly, and airfares are up nearly 10 percent over the past year, reflecting
strong demand and the pass-through of higher fuel costs.

As with consumer prices, capital goods prices have shown signs of acceleration.
The PPI for capital equipment moved up in April and May and has increased
0.8 percent over the past year--about 1/2 percentage point more than the
increase over the preceding twelve-month period. Part of that pickup reflects a
smaller rate of decline of computer prices: The PPI for computers fell about
16 percent over the past year after declining at about a 24 percent annual rate
over the preceding three years. The ongoing tightness in the market for
semiconductors could contribute to firmer computer prices through the summer.
The firming of investment prices has contributed to an acceleration in broad
price indexes. The chain price index for gross domestic purchases excluding
food and energy items increased 1.6 percent over the four quarters ended in
2000:Ql, up from a 1.3 percent rate of increase over the preceding four-quarter
period. The 0.3 percentage point acceleration in these prices is greater than the
slight acceleration in core PCE prices over this period.
Prices have been mixed at earlier stages of processing. The PPI for intermediate
materials excluding food and energy edged up another 0.1 percent in May,
bringing the twelve-month change in this series to 3.2 percent. In contrast, the
PPI for crude goods excluding food and energy moved down in May after
declines in both March and February; this index rose 15 percent in the twelve-
month period ended in February. In addition, prices of industrial commodities
outside of the energy area have moved down since the PPI's price quotes were
collected in mid-May. Despite the rise in prices of petroleum products, the
Journal of Commerce industrial price index was about unchanged over the past
month, reflecting price declines for metals and lumber products. At least in the
case of steel, some anecdotes suggest that the softening prices may be an
indication of weakening demand; as noted, excess supplies at steel service
centers have been reported. Prices of livestock and some farm crops have also
moved down in recent weeks.
The median response to the University of Michigan survey of one-year-ahead
inflation expectations was 2.9 percent in early June and averaged 3 percent for
the second quarter as a whole, the same as the average in the first quarter. These
near-term inflation expectations had risen about 1/2 percentage point over 1999,
presumably reflecting the actual increase in inflation that occurred over the
course of the year. The median five- to ten-year expectation of inflation from
the Michigan survey also was 2.9 percent in early June; these longer-term
inflation expectations have been quite stable over the past year.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Interest rates have fallen substantially since the May FOMC meeting, as
economic data have been interpreted as evidence that the Committee would not
have to tighten as much as had been previously expected. The interest rate
decline has helped to spur increases in equity prices, particularly in the
technology sector. Corporate borrowing has continued at a strong clip, while
household borrowing--though remaining robust--has slipped in the first half of
the year, primarily because of a slowdown in home mortgage borrowing. The
Treasury has continued to pay down substantial amounts of debt.
Interest Rates and Stock Prices
Market participants had largely anticipated the 50 basis point increases in the
federal funds and discount rates at the May FOMC meeting, as well as the
Committee's statement about continuing inflation risks. As a result, interest
rates rose only a little immediately after the FOMC announcement. Futures
quotes at that time indicated that a majority of market participants expected at
least a 25 basis point hike in the funds rate at the June FOMC meeting, and in
some circles there was talk of another 50 basis point action in June.
However, market participants interpreted the surprisingly weak May
employment report, in combination with other data releases, as evidence that
inflationary pressures were not building and that the FOMC would not have to
tighten as much as had been previously expected. Indeed, futures rates on net
have fallen sharply over the intermeeting period and currently indicate that most
market participants believe that the FOMC will not tighten at the upcoming
meeting. Moreover, rates on eurodollar futures contracts expiring farther out
embed, at most, another 1/4 percentage point of tightening.
Treasury yields have declined with the revised outlook for monetary policy. In
addition, yields may have been pulled lower by reports of substantial upward
revisions to expected federal budget surpluses in coming years. On balance,
Treasury yields have dropped between 25 and 50 basis points since the last
FOMC meeting. Yields on Treasury inflation-indexed securities also have
fallen over the intermeeting period, but less sharply than nominal Treasury
yields, suggesting that a portion of the movement in nominal yields was driven
by a decline in inflation compensation.
Investment-grade corporate bond yields generally followed yields in the
Treasury market, and have fallen between 35 and 60 basis points on net since
the last FOMC meeting. In contrast, junk bond yields have changed little on net
over the intermeeting period. As a result, spreads on high-yield corporate bonds
have widened appreciably since the last meeting, likely reflecting investors'
perceptions of increased credit risk among low-grade issuers as defaults
mounted.

Equity prices, as measured by the Wilshire 5000, have risen about 2 -3/4 percent
on net since the May FOMC meeting. After several steep drops shortly after the
meeting, which were partly driven by interest rate jitters, most indexes have
rebounded in recent weeks as these concerns eased. In the sharpest turnaround,
the Nasdaq posted a remarkable 19 percent rise in one week and is up about
11-1/4 percent since the last FOMC meeting. In addition, volatility of the
Nasdaq 100 has receded from its near-record level in early May. In contrast to
the upturn for technology stock prices, bank stocks fell over the intermeeting
period, pushed down most recently by concerns that second-quarter earnings for
a number of institutions would come in below expectations.
Business Finance
Profit growth for S&P 500 firms evidently has remained robust in the second
quarter but below the blistering pace of the last two quarters. Based on the
sparse reporting to date and some early pre-announcements, there is little to
suggest any aggregate shortfall from analyst projections.
Questions remain, however, about the credit quality of nonfinancial firms,
especially for lower-tier firms. Fourteen companies defaulted on a combined
face value of $5 billion in outstanding junk bonds in May, a new monthly
record. The default rate on a one-year trailing basis has now climbed to its
highest level since 1991. The ratio of liabilities of failed businesses to total
business liabilities also edged up and is now at its highest level since 1993.
Since the last FOMC meeting, Moody's has, on net, downgraded $190 billion of
debt, although most of the net downgrade was attributable to Ford, which still
retained a solid investment-grade rating.' Meanwhile, announcements of extra
provisioning for possible losses on syndicated loans by Wachovia and
UnionBanCal have raised concerns that a deterioration in business and
commercial mortgage loans may be in the offing.
Corporate bond issuance, which dried up almost completely amid the turbulence
in financial markets in April, recovered somewhat in May and has shown signs
of further improvement in June with the retreat in yields. Proceeds from recent
bond issues mainly have been used to complete pending mergers and
acquisitions. Buyers in the bond market continue to prefer large issues by
well-known investment-grade firms and, as a result, a number of potential junk
bond issuers have remained on the sidelines or sought alternative forms of
credit. In addition, buyers remain quite selective, preferring bonds with
maturities of ten years or less. Issuance of convertible bonds by high-tech
companies, which helped boost junk bond issuance in recent months, has not
reappeared since the Nasdaq's swoon in April.
1. As noted in the last Greenbook, Ford was downgraded following its announcement of a
$10 billion special dividend.

Firms needing immediate financing to complete mergers and large capital
expenditures have raised substantial funds in the commercial paper market.
AT&T, in particular, has sharply ramped up its volume of outstanding paper to
finance its acquisition of Media One. Credit problems for a few lower-tier
issuers have boosted spreads slightly in that part of the commercial paper market
but do not appear to have deterred issuance. Firms also have turned to banks to
meet their financing needs; commercial and industrial loans at banks grew
rapidly in April and May, though some slowing has been evident in the early
part of June.
Public equity issuance has remained weak in the intermeeting period, as investor
demand for the stocks of technology companies has not recovered since the
April stock price decline. Many firms postponed their IPOs after the drop in
prices; of those that went ahead, nearly three-fourths received a price below
their filing range. Nonetheless, a few telecommunications firms found
enthusiastic buyers, and the average of first-day returns on newly issued stock in
the quarter, though far lower than in the last couple of years, has still been above
its historical average. The volume of IPOs could well pick up in the next few
weeks, given some improvement in market tone associated with the turnaround
in stock prices and a backlog of more than 300 companies waiting to issue.
Merger activity has continued at an impressive pace, spurred by large
intra-industry deals. In the current quarter, equity retired from mergers will
likely finish at a near-record level, boosted by British Petroleum's purchase of
ARCO and the completion of AT&T's purchase of Media One. Announcements
of new deals also have remained brisk in the intermeeting period, indicating that
hefty merger-related equity retirements will persist in coming quarters.
However, announcements of stock buybacks have slowed considerably from
their record pace in the first quarter, when a large number of "old economy"
companies announced buyback initiatives. A handful of tech companies made
new announcements after their prices fell in April.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Yields on AAA-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have
fallen about 60 basis points since the May FOMC meeting, a drop similar to that
of other high-grade securities. Through late May, interest rates on commercial
mortgage loans had yet to turn down.
In contrast to the light volume in April and May, CMBS issuance is expected to
be heavy later this month and into July, as securitizers disgorge the loans that
piled up on their books when market conditions deteriorated earlier in the year.
Once these old loans have been securitized, CMBS issuance likely will drop
back. Commercial mortgage debt from all sources is expected to grow about 9
percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, paced by commercial bank
lending. This increase, while still strong, would be the smallest quarterly rise

since mid-1997. Delinquency rates for commercial mortgages at banks,
insurance companies, and in securitized pools all remain near their historic lows.
The double-digit loan growth in recent years may be putting some downward
pressure on these rates, as many loans originated during this period have not yet
reached an age at which defaults typically occur.
Household Finance
The value of household assets relative to disposable income likely fell in the
second quarter, as equity prices were lower on net despite the recent turnaround.
Stock price volatility and the lower average returns since the first quarter have
affected household asset choices. Net flows into equity mutual funds moderated
in May and early June. Among equity funds, investors still favor capital
appreciation funds--which on average hold a large share of their portfolio in
technology stocks--and international funds, but the rotation into these funds
from less risky total return funds has been less pronounced than in the first
quarter. Bond and hybrid funds continued to experience outflows in May as
interest rates were still generally rising over the first half of the month.
However, with the more recent rate declines, some bond funds have started to
attract inflows in early June.
Since the May FOMC meeting, changes in consumer and mortgage loan rates
have been mixed on balance. Rates on consumer loans at banks and on
adjustable-rate mortgages have risen 20 to 25 basis points, while rates for fixed-
rate mortgages have fallen 30 basis points on net. Most consumer rates are now
at their highest levels since early 1995, and adjustable-mortgage rates are at
their highest levels in nearly a decade. An exception to the recent upward trend
in consumer loan interest rates is the decline in rates charged by captive finance
companies for new-car loans, as manufacturers have continued incentive
programs in an effort to maintain strong auto sales. However, DaimlerChrysler
has indicated that it will shift away from these interest-rate incentives,
suggesting that these rates also may rise before long.
Mainly because of a slowdown in mortgage debt, overall household debt
growth--while remaining robust--appears to have decelerated a bit in the first
half of 2000. After growing at a 10 percent pace in 1999, mortgage debt growth
is expected to have slowed to a 7-1/2 percent pace in the first half of the year.
Consumer credit grew at a 7-3/4 percent annual rate in April, down from the
first quarter's double-digit pace, but still above the 1999 growth rate.
Rising household debt-service burdens suggest the potential for future problems,
but current measures of debt repayment performance show little sign of
deterioration. According to the most recent Call Report data, delinquency rates
on revolving home equity loans ticked up slightly during the first quarter, but
delinquency rates for home mortgage credit as a whole changed little and
remained near historic lows, while delinquency rates for consumer credit at

commercial banks fell to their lowest levels in four years. Delinquency rates on
new-car loans at captive finance companies and on credit cards in securitized
pools both edged up in April, but both series remain near their March levels,
which were the lowest in several years. The per capita personal bankruptcy rate
fell 11 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, dropping to its lowest level
in more than three years.
Treasury Finance
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury continued to run off the very high
cash balance it accumulated during the April tax season. The Treasury paid
down about $48 billion of maturing obligations in May, and substantial further
paydowns are expected on net this month. In addition, in May the Treasury
repurchased about $7 billion of coupon securities with maturities between
fifteen and twenty-three years, and plans to buy back another $2 billion during
June. The buyback operations to date have generally gone well, with
comfortable bid-to-cover ratios, and the immediate effects on markets appear to
have been fairly modest.
With tax receipts continuing to surprise on the high side, the staff now projects
that the federal budget surplus will be near $235 billion this fiscal year, more
than $10 billion higher than at the time of the last Greenbook. The Treasury
appears to be on course to pay down more than $235 billion of debt this fiscal
year, implying a decline of more than 6 percent in federal government debt held
by the public.
Liquidity in the Treasury bill market appears to have improved recently after
deteriorating over part of the intermeeting period. Bid-asked spreads for on-the-
run bills widened considerably for a time, and trading activity dipped, but both
of these measures now are close to their readings at the time of the last meeting.
Liquidity in the Treasury coupon security market has declined slightly, on
balance, with some bid-asked spreads widening and trading volume trending
lower.
Agency Finance
In contrast to the paydown of Treasury debt, borrowing by government-
sponsored agencies was robust in April (the most recent month for which we
have complete data), with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accounting for most of
this borrowing. At the end of May, the total amount of coupon securities
outstanding under Fannie and Freddie's benchmark securities programs
exceeded $230 billion.
Activity in the markets for agency security futures and options--which were
established in March--has expanded rapidly, with the Chicago Board of Trade
garnering an increasing share of the business. Trading in the CBOT's ten-year

agency options has increased substantially, and growth in the use of agency
futures has continued, though at a somewhat diminished pace.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds in April and May remained well
below the robust pace of the past two years. This decline largely reflects the
dropoff in refunding volume that has accompanied the generally rising interest
rates over the past year and a half. In addition, underwriters indicate that strong
state tax revenues have limited the need to issue bonds for funding new capital
expenditures.
Credit quality in the municipal sector (with the exception of the not-for-profit
health care sector) has continued to improve this year, as upgrades have
outnumbered downgrades by a ratio of three-to-one. Yields on municipal bonds
followed the Treasury market over the intermeeting period, and the ratios of
municipal yields to Treasuries and to Aaa corporate bonds were little changed.
Money and Bank Credit
Preliminary data for June suggest that M2 has resumed growing at a modest
pace after having fallen in May. The May decrease followed robust growth in
March and April and likely reflected a runoff of liquid deposit and money
market fund balances built up to meet exceptionally large nonwithheld tax
payments. In addition, the generally rising market interest rates associated with
recent monetary tightenings have been holding down the demand for M2 assets,
and currency growth, which skyrocketed over the century date change, has
remained sluggish. From September 1999 through May 2000, which smooths
through Y2K and tax effects, M2 has advanced at a 5-3/4 percent pace, down
from about 7 percent in the preceding year.
The growth of M3 has moderated in recent months from the brisk pace recorded
over the first three months of the year, with all components slowing. Even with
the slowing of M3 growth of late, this aggregate expanded at a 10 percent pace
from September 1999 through May 2000, up from its 7-1/2 percent advance
over the preceding year.
Adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules, bank credit accelerated in May to
an annual rate of 14 percent, up from 12-3/4 percent in April and 11-1/4 percent
in the first quarter. Slow growth in holdings of U.S. government securities was
more than offset by robust growth in other securities, and loan growth was
strong in most major categories. In particular, business loan growth spurted
from a steady 10-1/2 percent pace over the first four months of the year to
nearly 25 percent at an annual rate in May, though preliminary data indicate that
it has slowed somewhat in early June. Real estate loans also grew at a better
than 15 percent rate, paced by continued strength in home equity loans.

Business loan growth has remained robust despite the modest further tightening
of credit supply indicated by the May Survey of Terms of Business Lending.
Although the average spread over the federal funds rate charged by domestic
banks was little changed in the second quarter, spreads on acceptable- and
moderate-risk loans edged up relative to those of minimal risk. The survey also
showed a continued shift in originations toward lower-risk loans.

The value of exports in April remained steady at the strong level recorded in
March. Increases in capital goods (largely aircraft) were offset by declines-from
unusually high levels-in industrial supplies and automotive products. Exports of
aircraft rose sharply in April from the strike-affected low recorded in March.
The level of exports in April was 2 percent higher than the average for the first
quarter.
The value of imports in April was about the same as in March. An increase in
the value of imported capital goods (primarily computers) was largely offset by a
decline in the value of oil imports caused by a sharp decline in oil prices. The
level of imports in April was 3 percent higher than in the first quarter.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods.
Oil. Following a sharp increase in the first quarter of 2000, the price of imported
oil declined over $2 per barrel in April, marking the first significant decline
since late 1998. The easing of oil prices, which resulted primarily from
increased crude oil production from OPEC and other producers, proved short-
lived and spot oil prices have rebounded strongly since mid-April. In May, the
monthly average spot price of West Texas Intermediate rose over $3 per barrel to
nearly $29 per barrel; spot WTI has recently traded above $30 per barrel.
Strengthening global oil demand, resulting from the need to rebuild stocks and
robust economic activity, combined with uncertainty over OPEC's production
plans, appear to be driving the increase in oil prices.

Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods, as well as prices of core
goods (which exclude computers, semiconductors, and oil), declined slightly in
May following three months of increases. Among the major trade categories,
only the price of imported automotive products rose in May. For April-May
combined, prices of non-oil imports rose 1 percent at an annual rate compared
with increases of nearly 2 percent in the last two quarters. This lower rate of
increase in April-May reflected slower rises in the price of imported non-oil
industrial supplies and slightly faster rates of decline in prices of imported
consumer goods and foods. The price of imported machinery excluding
computers and semiconductors declined only slightly in April-May, and the price
of imported automotive products rose. Prices of core goods rose 1-1/2 percent at
an annual rate in April-May, somewhat less than in the last two quarters.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports rose slightly in May. For April-May
combined, the increase was 2 percent at an annual rate, a somewhat smaller rise
than in the last two quarters. The increases were largely in agricultural products
and industrial supplies. Prices of exported core goods (which exclude
computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products) rose 1-1/2 percent at an
annual rate in April-May following two quarters of stronger increases; most of
the slowing was from smaller increases in prices of industrial supplies.

U.S. Current Account
The U.S. current account deficit rose to $409 billion at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the first quarter of 2000, an increase of $24 billion over the fourth
quarter (revised). The increase in the current account deficit was driven by a
$40 billion decline in the balance on goods and services. In contrast, the deficits
on investment income and on other income and unilateral transfers narrowed in
the first quarter. Net investment income payments declined $6 billion as an
increase in investment income receipts outpaced a more modest increase in
payments. Net outflows of unilateral transfers decreased $9 billion-more than
accounted for by a fall in U.S. government grants, which were elevated in the
fourth quarter by grants to Israel.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased $7 billion in April
(line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table). While
holdings of Treasury bills declined $7 billion, holdings of Treasury bonds
increased by $6 billion. The overall decrease in foreign official holdings of
Treasury securities was more than offset by increases in holdings of agency
bonds and deposit claims on U.S. banks. As in recent periods, Japanese reserve
flows-associated with foreign-exchange intervention-resulted in the largest net
inflow. Elsewhere, significant increases in Korean, Russian, and Spanish
reserves were offset by decreases recorded for Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, and
Singapore. Partial data from the FRBNY indicate a slight decline in foreign
official assets for May.
Private foreigners bought net $21 billion of U.S. securities in April, down from
$37 billion in March (line 4). In contrast to calendar year 1999 and the first
quarter of this year, when foreigners made net sales, they bought $5 billion of
Treasury securities on net in April; their net purchases of Treasury bonds
outpaced their net sales of Treasury bills. Net acquisitions by Japanese investors
alone more than accounted for total net purchases of Treasury bonds by the
private foreign sector. This outcome contrasts sharply with Japanese net sales of
long-term Treasuries in recent periods. Although foreign demand for U.S.
agency bonds and corporate securities apparently slackened from record highs in
March, the $5 billion in net purchases of agency bonds recorded in April was
still robust and remained in line with the past few quarters. Transactions in
agency bonds were concentrated in the Caribbean financial centers and to a
lesser extent in Japan and other Asian markets. Net purchases of U.S. corporate
bonds totaling $8 billion came principally from the United Kingdom and the
Caribbean. The decrease in net purchases of corporate bonds in April, as
compared with March, coincides with a substantial decline in gross U.S.
corporate bond issuance, including Euro-issues, in April. Net purchases of U.S.
equities in April amounted to $3 billion. Large purchases by Europe and Asia
contrasted with substantial net sales by the Caribbean financial centers.

IV-7
On balance, U.S. investors were modest net sellers of foreign securities in April
(line 5). Across major regions, U.S. net sales of foreign bonds reported against
Latin America and the Caribbean more than offset U.S. purchases in Europe,
Canada and Singapore. As for foreign equities, net purchases by U.S. residents
were reported in a relatively few areas and predominantly in the Caribbean
financial centers. Large net sales were reported vis-a-vis Germany, the United
Kingdom, and Japan. However, these data do not include the foreign stock
acquired by U.S. residents associated with foreign takeovers of U.S. firms.
Such acquisitions amounted to more than $26 billion in April, the largest being
some $21 billion arising from the BP Amoco/Atlantic Richfield merger. Net
U.S. sales of foreign equities in April may be due in part to a rebalancing of U.S.
portfolios following mergers.
A small net inflow of $5 billion was recorded for the banking sector in April
(line 3). Inflows reported by U.S.-chartered institutions were even greater than
large outflows from U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks vis-a-vis
related offices abroad. Partial data for May indicate that there were substantial
inflows to both U.S.-chartered and foreign-chartered banks. These inflows are
consistent with May's strong growth in domestic bank credit.
Recently released balance of payments data indicate that in the first quarter,
direct investment capital inflows (line 7) fell moderately from the fourth quarter
of 1999, while direct investment outflows (line 6) were basically flat. On
balance, net direct investment inflows narrowed to $8 billion in the first quarter
from $16 billion in the fourth.
Foreigners reduced their holdings of U.S. currency by almost $7 billion in the
first quarter following a rapid increase in late 1999 in anticipation of the century
date change (line 8).
The statistical discrepancy (last line of table) was a positive $30.4 billion in the
first quarter and essentially unchanged from the positive $30.5 billion in the last
quarter of 1999 (revised from $9.6 billion). A positive statistical discrepancy
indicates under reporting either of net receipts in the current account, of net
inflows in the financial account, or both.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the May FOMC meeting the dollar has depreciated relatively sharply
versus major currencies. On balance, the major currencies index of the dollar's
nominal exchange value fell 2-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period, led by a
3-3/4 percent depreciation of the dollar versus the yen and 3-1/2 percent depreciation
against the euro. The dollar also depreciated 1 percent against the Canadian
dollar. Sterling was an exception, against which the dollar appreciated slightly
on balance. The index of the exchange value of the dollar versus other important
trading partners rose 3/4 percent, due almost entirely to a steep depreciation of the
Mexican peso.

According to many market participants, the dollar's recent depreciation against
major currencies owed to the cumulative effect of successive U.S. data releases,
particularly the May employment report, which diminished expectations for
future FOMC interest rate increases relative to future policy moves expected of
foreign central banks. The growing expectation of a narrowing in the spread
among official rates was especially influential in pushing the dollar down
relative to the euro, as economic data for the euro area released during the
intermeeting period pointed toward accelerating activity and further monetary
tightening. On June 8, the European Central Bank exceeded market
expectations by raising its two-week refinancing rate 50 basis points. Since
then, the exchange value of the dollar has been little changed on balance against
the euro.

IV-10
The dollar's depreciation in terms of the yen occurred against the backdrop of
rumblings from Bank of Japan Policy Board members that the Japanese central
bank's zero-interest-rate policy is drawing to an end. Also bolstering the
exchange value of the yen were signs of improving domestic demand, both in
the first quarter GDP statistics and in April real household spending data.
The dollar appreciated slightly against sterling, however, as continued signs of a
slowing pace of economic activity in the United Kingdom have led to market
speculation that the Bank of England may be nearing the end of its tightening
cycle.

Just prior to the FOMC's decision on May 16, the Bank of Mexico surprised
market participants by announcing that it would increase to 200 million pesos
from 180 million pesos the "corto," or amount by which it leaves the banking
system short of required reserves. The day following the FOMC meeting, the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the
Bank of Canada all raised their policy rates 50 basis points. Subsequent to the
European Central Bank's decision on June 8 to raise its refinancing rate 50 basis
points, the central bank of Denmark raised its policy rates by as much. On
June 14, the Bank of Norway raised its policy rate 50 basis points, and the
following day the Swiss National Bank increased its target band for Swiss franc

LIBOR by an equal amount. The Central Bank of Brazil unexpectedly lowered
the Selic rate by 100 basis points to 17.5 percent on June 20, the lowest rate
since the 1994 introduction of the real.
While short-term rates rose significantly during the intermeeting period in
continental Europe, ten-year sovereign bond yields in most European economies
declined about 20 basis points and Canadian government bond yields fell almost
40 basis points. Similar yields in Japan fell just 4 basis points. Headline
European equity indices were mixed with limited price movements; the Japanese
TOPIX index lost almost 3 percent, but Canadian shares rose more than
9 percent.

The Mexican peso depreciated 3 1/4 percent against the dollar after Francisco
Labastida, presidential candidate of the ruling PRI party, said that if he failed to
win the July 2 election by a wide margin, Mexico may experience social unrest.
.Since the
May FOMC meeting, the Mexican Bolsa has risen 2 3/4 percent.
In contrast, most other emerging market asset prices have benefitted from
diminished market expectations for higher U.S. policy rates in the future. Bond
spreads in emerging markets, as measured by the J.P. Morgan EMBI+ index,
have shed almost 1 percentage point since the May FOMC meeting, even as the
U.S. Treasury curve shifted down 25 to 60 basis points. Equity price indices in
Argentina and Brazil climbed 2 1/2 and 13 percent, respectively. Asian share
prices were mixed, rising moderately in most countries, but falling more than
8 percent in Malaysia and 4 percent in Indonesia. Hong Kong and Mainland
Chinese shares received a boost from the passage of Permanent Normal Trading
Relations with China by the U.S. House of Representatives. The Hang Seng
rose 9 percent and Shanghai B shares (open to foreigners) rose 31 percent.
The price of gold rose nearly $12 per troy ounce over the intermeeting period to
a level of $287. Market participants attributed the sharp rise in the spot price to
short-covering by producers, related to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.
According to market participants, gold producers had sold numerous Australian-
dollar-denominated call options on gold in recent months. As the dollar
depreciated sharply against a broad spectrum of foreign currencies, including the
Australian dollar, the accompanying fall in the Australian-dollar price of gold
forced these producers to cover their short positions in the spot market, driving
up the spot price of gold.

IV-13
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the May Greenbook confirm that the foreign industrial
economies expanded robustly in the first quarter and suggest that growth
generally continued at a strong pace in the second quarter. The Japanese
economy rebounded in the first quarter from the sharp contraction in the second
half of last year, but is apparently growing more slowly in the current quarter.
Growth in Canada and the euro area remained near last year's pace in the first
quarter, and current-quarter indicators have shown considerable strength. In the
United Kingdom, in contrast, economic growth appears to be slowing, probably
reflecting the impact of past monetary tightening and the strong pound.
Twelve-month measures of consumer price inflation have eased a bit recently in
most foreign industrial countries, largely related to a moderation in energy
prices. Canadian inflation has moved down from the top of its target range, and
core inflation has declined as well. In the euro area, inflation has moved back
below the 2 percent target ceiling, and core inflation has remained just over
1 percent. U.K. consumer price inflation remains well below its target rate, and
Japanese consumer prices have continued to decline.
Since the May Greenbook, both the Bank of Canada and the European Central
Bank have raised official interest rates 50 basis points. The Bank of Canada
emphasized the strong momentum in the economy and expressed concern that
activity may be pushing against capacity. The ECB highlighted risks to price
stability from strong money growth and a strong euro-area economy.
In Japan, real GDP rose 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) during 2000Q1, with about
2 percentage points of this growth resulting from inadequate adjustment for the
leap year. Consumption was up a little over 7 percent at an annual rate
following steep declines in the two previous quarters. Private investment rose
sharply, as nonresidential investment increased at a double-digit pace for the
second consecutive quarter, and residential investment rebounded from a very
weak performance in the second half of last year. In contrast, public investment
declined sharply for the third consecutive quarter. The external sector
contributed about 3-1/2 percentage points to GDP growth in the first quarter, as
exports surged and imports fell slightly.
Indicators suggest continued expansion in the second quarter, although at a
much slower rate than in the first quarter. Industrial production fell slightly in
April; but this drop followed three successive quarters of growth, and the
outlook remains relatively bright. New car registrations were up in April, while
housing starts and machinery orders fell slightly.

IV-14
Ongoing corporate restructuring continues to take its toll on the Japanese labor
market, with the unemployment rate only ticking below its historical high of
4.9 percent, and the offers-to-applicants ratio edging up to 0.56, still a very low
level.

Deflation continues in the prices of most Japanese goods and services as well as
real estate. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh
food but include energy) were down 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, and
the GDP deflator fell again in the first quarter, recording a year-over-year decline
of 1.8 percent. The wholesale price index for domestic goods was up 0.3 percent
year-over-year in May, largely reflecting higher energy prices. The Japan Real
Estate Institute's urban land price index was down 3 percent at the end of March
compared with six months earlier and was 33 percent below its September 1991
peak.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first four months of 2000 was
$120 billion (s.a.a.r.), up from $112 billion in the same period of the previous
year. Denominated in dollars, exports were up 18 percent in the first quarter
from year-ago levels, largely because of a continuing surge in exports to the
developing Asian economies. Imports were up 24 percent, partly reflecting a
jump in the value of oil imports.

In the euro area, preliminary estimates show that real GDP rose 3 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. In both France and Germany, where real GDP rose
about 2-3/4 percent, domestic demand--fueled by rising equipment spending and
business fixed investment--helped support growth, while net exports were flat.
Incoming data suggest that the pace of economic activity continued to pick up in
the second quarter. In April and May, euro-area economic sentiment remained
at record high levels. In April, German industrial production rose sharply on the
back of robust manufacturing output, and the volume of German industry orders
grew 2.5 percent (s.a.). Strong domestic orders more than offset a slight decline
in foreign orders.

In April, the harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged further
down to 9.2 percent, its lowest rate since August 1992. (In constructing the
harmonized unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes national statistics to
International Labor Organization definitions.) In France, Germany, and Italy,
unemployment rates remain above the euro-area average, although they have
declined noticeably over the past year. May data show that the German
unemployment rate, which a month earlier had fallen below 10 percent for the
first time since 1995, remained flat at 9.6 percent.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in the twelve months to May, with
the pass-through effects of recent oil price increases on consumer prices
appearing to be diminish. Headline consumer price inflation had reached a peak
in March, sightly above the 2 percent target ceiling set by the ECB. Excluding
energy prices, the twelve-month inflation rate has remained just above 1 percent.

On June 8, the European Central Bank raised its official interest rates by 50 basis
points each. In a post-meeting press conference following the interest rate
decision, ECB president Wim Duisenberg noted that "risks to price stability over
the medium term have continued to increase," citing 12-month harmonized M3
growth that continues to exceed the ECB's reference value, economic indicators
that suggest continued strong growth in the euro area, and the increase in oil
prices in May. The ECB also announced that, in an effort to help alleviate the
overbidding problem that has persisted since early last year, it will switch its
main refinancing operations to a variable-rate tender with a minimum bid rate of
4.25 percent, effective June 28.

Economic activity in the United Kingdom slowed in the first quarter, with real
GDP growing 2.2 percent (s.a.a.r.). Total domestic demand rose 1.8 percent,
with consumption expenditures and investment spending slowing from the pace
in the fourth quarter, and government spending declining for the first time in two
years. Net exports made a significant positive contribution to growth.
Current data for the second quarter suggest that economic activity will remain at
a slower pace than last year. Although industrial production was up 0.9 percent
in April, the gain was mainly due to a sharp increase in electric and gas demand
during unseasonably cold weather. Business sentiment fell in April and May
because of weak export orders. The average volume of retail sales in April and
May was unchanged from first-quarter sales.
Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate remained at 3.9 percent in May, the lowest rate in 20 years, and the labor
force survey measure of the unemployment rate fell to a record low 5.7 percent
for the three months centered in March. Average annual earnings growth slowed
in April, however, as bonuses were smaller than in recent months.
Producer input prices have continued to rise briskly, boosted in May by a sharp
increase in the cost of crude oil; producer output prices have remained subdued.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest

IV-19
rates) remains well below the 2-1/2 percent target. Since raising the official repo
rate to 6 percent in February, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
has left the repo rate unchanged.

In Canada, real GDP rose 4.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, matching last
year's vigorous pace. Net exports accounted for roughly half the gain, as exports
grew a sizable 13.9 percent. In contrast, import growth slowed after rising
sharply in the fourth quarter of last year as the pace of domestic demand
slackened. Though slowing, both consumption and investment growth remained
solid in the first quarter. In particular, investment spending on computers and
other office equipment continued to expand rapidly, rising over 40 percent in the
first quarter. Both government spending and inventory accumulation were soft
in the first quarter, with inventories subtracting 1.1 percentage points from GDP
growth.
After holding about steady in April, employment resumed growth in May. Solid
gains were registered in service sector employment, while employment
continued to rebound in resource-based industries. May's job gains helped
lower the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent, the lowest rate since March 1976.

Movements in energy prices largely explained the sharp decline in the twelve-
month change in consumer prices in April and the partial rebound in May. Core
consumer price inflation (which excludes food and energy) has also moved
lower, on balance, over the past two months. Despite low core inflation, the
Bank of Canada matched the 50 basis point rate increase by the Federal Reserve
by raising its Bank Rate from 51/2 percent to 6 percent on May 17. In explaining
its latest rate hike, the Bank continued to emphasize the strong momentum in the
economy from both domestic and external sources and its concern that the high
level of activity is putting pressure on the economy's capacity.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity continued to expand in Latin America, reflecting both strong
export growth and a pickup in domestic demand. Growth appeared to be
strongest in Mexico and Brazil, although output indicators suggest some slowing
from the fast pace of recent quarters. Recovery also continued in Argentina,
albeit at a more modest pace. Inflation rates continued to trend downward in
Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela; in Argentina, consumer prices fell further.
The level of economic activity across emerging Asian economies remained
robust, despite signs of some slowing following an extraordinary surge in the
first quarter. Even allowing for leap year effects, growth was remarkably strong
in Greater China and the ASEAN region, driven by a rise in exports and a
rebound in private consumption. Korea's economy also performed strongly,
although growth cooled some from the rapid pace of last year. In most countries
in the region, recent inflation data have suggested a distinct absence of
inflationary pressures. Trade surpluses have narrowed as strong activity and
high oil prices have stimulated imports.
In Mexico, economic activity continued to expand rapidly in recent months, with
real GDP rising more than 11 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. In April,
industrial production increased by 3 percent (s.a.), driven by both strong exports
and domestic demand. However, the average unemployment rate in April and
May rose slightly from its first-quarter level. This, together with the tightening
of monetary policy in mid-May, suggests that the pace of growth may have
slowed in the second quarter. The strength of domestic demand led to a surge in
imports in April, nearly doubling the trade deficit to over $13 billion (s.a.a.r.)
compared with its first-quarter level. Inflationary pressures remained contained,
with consumer price inflation continuing its slight downward trend in May.
Financial markets in Mexico have been particularly volatile over the past few
weeks, amid increasing political uncertainty in Mexico and concerns that the
U.S. economy might have begun to slow. Domestic interest rates have generally
been on the rise since late April. Statements by Francisco Labastida, the
presidential candidate of the ruling PRI party, asserting that, if he does not win
the July 2 presidential elections by a clear margin, there could be disruptions to
the Mexican economy, appeared to have contributed to weakness in the peso.
The election race is tight; latest polls indicate that Labastida has only a slim lead
over his main rival, Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party (PAN).

In Brazil, data released since the May Greenbook paint a mixed picture of
economic activity. Industrial production rose nearly 3 percent (s.a.) in April, but
was still unchanged from its first-quarter level. Sales and production of
automobiles rose strongly in May to levels 20 percent and 25 percent higher than
in the same periods a year earlier, respectively. Consumer prices fell in May,
lowering the twelve-month inflation rate to 6.5 percent, only slightly above the
government's mid-point inflation target for 2000 of 6 percent.
In early June, the central bank reduced the (non-remunerated) reserve
requirement on demand deposits from 55 to 45 percent, the second decline in the
last few months. On June 20, the central bank lowered its benchmark Selic
overnight interest rate 100 basis points to 17.5 percent and announced a
downward bias toward future moves. The interest rate reduction had not been
expected by analysts, as the central bank had previously expressed concern about
potential inflationary pressures stemming from rises in government-controlled
prices (including energy prices) and about the risk of future interest rate
increases in the United States.

IV-27
Brazil's government continued to record monthly primary budget surpluses,
putting it well over the minimum requirements under its IMF program.
However, the government faces the prospect of potentially large future liabilities
associated with several lawsuits currently making their way through the courts.
Furthermore, legal maneuvering by opponents may once again postpone the
privatization of one of the country's largest banks, Banespa, currently scheduled
for next month.

In Argentina, data released since the May Greenbook provide mixed evidence
on the pace of activity in the second quarter. Industrial production recovered
somewhat in May following a sharp drop in April, but was still below its first-
quarter level. Export growth for April posted another strong gain and, combined
with anemic import growth, led to a $2.2 billion trade surplus for that month.
Tax revenues jumped in May following several months of weaker-than-expected
receipts. Despite these positive figures, with import growth weak and with
consumer prices continuing to fall through May, the evidence suggests no more
than a modest recovery so far.
Financial market conditions were somewhat rocky over the past month. In
mid-May, bond rates jumped after the release of weak tax revenue figures for
April raised concerns that Argentina might miss its budget targets for the second
quarter. To alleviate these concerns, President de la Rua announced further
spending cuts in late May. Markets have responded positively to the fiscal

IV-28
package: Argentina's Brady and EMBI+ spreads over Treasuries have fallen
from their peaks in mid May, domestic short-term rates have also dropped
notably, and the stock market has recovered somewhat. International spreads,
however, remain elevated from their recent lows, in late March, as the state of
the domestic economy and international liquidity conditions remain uncertain.

High oil prices continue to sustain the Venezuelan economy. The current
account registered a $14 billion surplus at an annual rate in the first quarter that
was more than entirely accounted for by revenues from oil exports. Oil revenues
are also fueling an expansion of government spending. Outside the public and
oil sectors, the level of activity remained very low. Unofficial reports put the
unemployment rate above 20 percent. Consistent with high unemployment rates,
price inflation continued to decline. Elections for almost all political offices,
which had been planned for the end of May, have been postponed because of
technical flaws in the ballot system. The elections have yet to be rescheduled
but are expected some time in the next few months. Uncertainty about the
economy and the elections remains a source of concern for investors. Despite
the significant current account surplus, foreign currency reserves have risen only
modestly, pointing to sizable capital flight.

In Korea, data for recent activity have been mixed, but on balance appear to
suggest some slowing in the very rapid pace of recovery. Real GDP growth in
the first quarter moderated from the double digit rate of last year. Domestic
demand growth slowed, with inventory investment providing less of a positive
contribution. Industrial production declined for the third consecutive month in
April. However, officials attributed the April decrease mainly to special factors,
in particular strikes in the automobile industry and fewer working days on
account of a general election holiday. In contrast to the decline in production,
employment grew strongly, and the unemployment rate continued to ease in
May. Recent data give no indication of a pickup in inflation.
The recent financial difficulties of Hyundai, the largest chaebol (industrial
conglomerate), served as a reminder that, despite a sustained rapid recovery in
activity, there are still significant weaknesses in Korea's financial and corporate
sectors. Hyundai's latest difficulties were precipitated by a refusal by lenders to
renew loans to two Hyundai subsidiaries, mainly because of concerns over the
health of the group's investment trust company. The lenders relented, but only
after Hyundai agreed to a significant restructuring and the relinquishment of
management control by the conglomerate's aging founder. Hyundai's
difficulties prompted a temporary drop in equity prices and downward exchange
market pressure on the won.

The ASEAN region had a remarkably strong first quarter, with Malaysia,
Singapore, and Indonesia all registering double digit rates of growth. Activity
also expanded in Thailand, although at a more modest pace. Exports remained
strong, and rebounding consumption played a larger role in the regional
recovery, particularly for Malaysia. Nevertheless, quarterly figures for these
countries are often volatile and may have been influenced by leap year effects.
April industrial production indices point to continued strength in Singapore, but
suggest some payback in Malaysia. Countries across the region continued to
record trade surpluses. Inflation edged up slightly in May in several ASEAN
countries, but remains very low across the region.
In contrast, first-quarter growth in the Philippines was disappointing, coming in
at just 0.2 percent (s.a.a.r.), as agricultural growth slowed and government
spending was constrained by the combination of weak revenue collection and a
deficit target. Industrial production figures in Thailand also point to some
weakness.
A hostage crisis and renewed conflict between government forces and Muslim
separatists in the southern Philippines have added to existing political
uncertainties there. Separatist pressures have also increased in Indonesia's West
Papua, following a vote for independence by the West Papua congress. On a
positive note, a cease fire was recently signed between the Indonesian
government and separatist forces in Aceh.

Indonesia signed a new letter of intent with the IMF, allowing it to continue its
IMF adjustment program and fulfilling the prerequisite for its Paris Club
restructuring. Nevertheless, the honeymoon has clearly ended for the Wahid
administration, following months of contradictory public statements, a lack of
leadership on economic reform, and allegations of corruption. Bank Indonesia
Governor Syahril Sabirin also became embroiled in controversy after being
named as a suspect in last year's Bank Bali scandal.
In China, retail sales figures for April suggest that the nascent recovery in
private consumption continued, partly reflecting the impact of government
measures such as increased social welfare benefits. China's monthly trade
surplus widened in April and May, as imports declined from their first-quarter
level while exports were roughly unchanged. Recently released data show that
the current account surplus shrank to $15.7 billion in 1999 from $29.3 billion a
year earlier. Consumer prices were essentially unchanged in May on a
twelve-month basis.
In May, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a trade bill that grants China
Permanent Normal Trading Relations status, which will facilitate U.S. market
access on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). That same
month, China finalized an agreement with the European Union on its accession
to the WTO. Bilateral agreements are still under negotiation with several
smaller WTO member states, with final accession expected by the end of the
year.

In Hong Kong, real GDP surged 23.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, driven
by a sharp pickup in private consumption, in turn reflecting strong employment
growth as well as wealth effects associated with large stock market gains.
Exports of goods and services also grew strongly, as Hong Kong's entrepot
economy continued to benefit from the steep rise in trade flows throughout
emerging Asia. Strong gains in employment pushed the unemployment rate
down to 5.1 percent (s.a.) in the March-May period, notwithstanding rapid
expansion in the labor force. Weakness in the property market continued to
contain inflationary pressures; consumer prices in April were roughly flat on a
seasonally adjusted basis, bringing the twelve-month rate of decline to
4.4 percent. In mid-May, following the FOMC meeting, the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority raised the base rate it charges at its discount window
50 basis points to 8 percent.
In Taiwan, real GDP rose 10.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, on the back
of a sharp pickup in domestic demand and continued rapid growth in the
export-oriented electronics and information technology sectors. Industrial
production rose 4.3 percent (s.a.) in May, following some weakness in April.
The twelve-month rate of inflation continued to creep up in the face of robust
domestic demand and high oil prices, albeit to still very low levels. Despite
strong export growth, a surge in imports of capital goods in May pushed the
trade balance into deficit.
