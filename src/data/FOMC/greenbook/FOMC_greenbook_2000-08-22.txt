Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
On balance, economic activity appears to be expanding at a more moderate pace
than observed earlier in the year. Growth of employment and hours worked has
shifted down noticeably in recent months, and sales of new homes and motor
vehicles are well off their earlier highs. By contrast, business spending for
equipment and software continues to surge. Labor markets remain extremely
tight. Some measures of hourly labor compensation have accelerated
significantly of late, and nearly all are rising considerably more rapidly than a
few years ago. But with productivity growth also having increased, most
measures of core prices have accelerated only modestly.
Real GDP
According to the advance estimate prepared by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the second
quarter. Data received since the advance release suggest that real GDP growth
will be marked down to about a 4.9 percent rate, as downward revisions to
expenditures on nonresidential structures, residential investment, and state and
local government spending more than offset an upward revision to inventories.1
Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion of second-quarter activity in this
section of the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions to GDP.

Labor Market Developments
The data for July reinforce the impression that private-sector hiring has slowed
since the first quarter of this year. However, the labor market remains quite
tight, and employers continue to report difficulties in finding and retaining
workers.
Private nonfarm payrolls rose 138,000 in July following an average monthly
increase of about 120,000 in the second quarter. This pace was down from
240,000 per month in the first quarter of the year and 200,000 per month over
all of 1999. A portion of the deceleration can be attributed to industries--such as
construction--in which the interaction of tight labor markets, heavy demand, and
unusual weather may have distorted usual seasonal employment patterns.
Despite an increase in July, employment in finance, insurance, and real estate
has fallen appreciably since February, and payroll gains have been less robust in
services--perhaps reflecting the difficulty in finding workers.2 In addition,
almost all of the rise in retail trade employment in July reflected hiring at eating
and drinking places, a category that has been quite volatile in the past several
months. Manufacturing employment posted a strong gain last month, although
the BLS cautions that changes in the timing of regular summer vacations and
related factory downtimes may have shifted some employment from August into
July on a seasonally adjusted basis (as appears to have been the case last year).
As a result of the smaller employment gains, aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose at an annual rate of
1.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 3.2 percent annual rate in the
first quarter and a 2.1 percent increase over the whole of 1999. July's increase
of 0.1 percent (not at an annual rate) left the level of hours just a bit above the
second-quarter average.
One outstanding question is the extent to which private employment gains have
been affected by the hiring patterns associated with the decennial Census.
While there are no data that would allow us to answer this question
conclusively, an examination of worker flows using Current Population Survey
(CPS) microdata indicates that an unusually large number of workers moved
from private employment to federal employment between April and May, which
was when Census added the bulk of its intermittent workers. The CPS data do
not indicate a large net flow of workers from the federal government to the
private sector between May and June, when the Census began to release
2. The change in employment in services was held down about 30,000 in July as a result of
the implementation of the Workforce Investment Act, which replaced the federally funded
summer jobs program for youth with a year-round program. Nevertheless, employment gains
elsewhere in services were small last month.

intermittent workers in large numbers, but the movement may show up in the
July data, which we have not yet received.3
In the household survey, the labor force participation rate, which had surged to
more than 67-1/2 percent earlier in the year, averaged just 67.1 percent over the
past three months. We had ascribed a portion of the first-quarter increase in the
participation rate to a somewhat delayed reaction to strong real wage growth
and abundant employment opportunities. Although we expect that July's
reading of 66.9 percent--the lowest since August 1998--overshot on the down
side, it now appears that the participation rate probably has remained roughly
trendless since 1997. Employment growth in the household survey has
generally followed the pattern of labor force growth, and thus the
unemployment rate--which stood at 4.0 percent in July--has fluctuated in a
narrow range since last September.
As with the unemployment rate, other indicators suggest that the labor market
remains tight. Smoothing through the weekly ups and downs, the level of initial
claims for unemployment insurance has been running about 300,000 per week
over the past two months; although claims are up from a few months ago, they
remain quite low by historical standards. Likewise, the level of insured
unemployment has risen since mid-May, but only to levels that are similar to
those posted at the beginning of the year. Households responding to both the
Conference Board and Michigan consumer surveys remained optimistic about
job prospects. On the employers' side, the National Federation of Independent
Businesses's (NFIB's) measure of "positions hard to fill" ticked down in July
but remained near the record high posted in each of the previous three months.
The latest estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that output per
hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the
second quarter.4 This leaves nonfarm business productivity up 5.1 percent over
3. The number of temporary Census employees fell 292,000 in July after having declined
136,000 in June. About 190,000 additional workers will leave the Census payroll by the end of
the year.
4. We currently do not expect this figure to be revised, as our predicted changes to output
and the revisions to hours that are implied by the July employment report offset each other. (The
BLS did not incorporate the hours data from the July employment report--which was released on
August 4--into the second-quarter productivity data that were released on August 8.)

the four quarters ending in 2000:Q2.5 This rate of increase is more than twice as
fast as the year-earlier change and represents the largest four-quarter gain since
1983, when the economy was recovering from a deep recession. In the
nonfinancial corporate sector, output per hour rose 4.5 percent over the year
ending in 2000:Q1 (latest available data); with the exception of the 4.8 percent
increase posted over 1999, this was the largest four-quarter change since 1976.

e. Staff estimate.
Industrial Production
Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in July following a more moderate gain in
June. A surge in oil and natural gas drilling in the wake of higher energy prices
pushed up mining production last month, while cooler-than-normal temperatures
depressed utilities output. Manufacturing production rose about 1/2 percent for
the fourth consecutive month. July's increase in output reflected advances
across a variety of industries and market groups.
Activity in the high-tech sector (that is, computers, semiconductors, and
communications equipment) continues to be strong. Although recent rates of
output growth have been somewhat lower than ones posted earlier this year, we
5. The patterns of nonfarm business output and productivity growth have been distorted over
the past three quarters because the BEA attributed to the last quarter of 1999 payments to
defense contractors for goods and services that were delivered in the first quarter of 2000. The
staff estimates that this shift boosted fourth-quarter output and productivity growth rates by
about 0.6 percentage point, held down the first-quarter growth rates by about 1.2 percentage
points, and raised second-quarter growth rates by 0.6 percentage point. (The change in
productivity over the four quarters ending in 2000:Q2 is unaffected by the shift.)
The anomaly probably did not distort the nonfinancial corporate figures, which are
measured using the income-side data from the national accounts; in their own accounts,
corporations most likely applied the early federal payments to the first quarter.

suspect that the earlier gains were temporarily boosted by the lifting of Y2K-
related lockdowns. Indeed, the 3-1/2 percent average monthly pace of increase
in high-tech output in June and July is still very high by historical standards.
Although we see little evidence of significant strains on supply in the high-tech
sector as a whole, the narrowly defined semiconductor industry--where factory
operating rates are in excess of 100 percent--presents a notable exception. The
industry is facing a torrid pace of demand, and some downstream producers are
encountering price hikes for--and spot shortages of--certain types of chips. The
rate of capacity expansion in semiconductors has increased significantly and
will likely continue to be rapid; last month the Semiconductor Industry
Association revised up its forecast for growth of nominal capital spending in
2000 by North American semiconductor producers by roughly 50 percentage
points.

in production that would leave assemblies at a 13.2 million unit annual rate for
the third quarter as a whole, down only 1/4 million units from the second-
quarter pace. Nonetheless, the third-quarter rate is off 1/2 million units from the
schedules initially announced in May. Medium and heavy truck production
tumbled in June, and recovered only a fraction of its loss in July. Elsewhere in
the transportation sector, production of aircraft and parts turned up moderately

Production of other types of non-high-tech business equipment and parts was

appear ripe for further expansion. Led by a surge in bookings for engines and
turbines, new orders jumped 5-1/2 percent in June; even excluding these items,
which tend to have long lead times ahead of shipments, orders were up

from lows posted at the end of last year, and the inventory-shipments ratio for
the category has been dropping rapidly since the beginning of 1999.

0.4 percent in July, with widespread increases posted across its components.
This gain followed weak growth in output in the first quarter and a decline in the
second. Indeed, the July production figures appear strong relative to other
indicators of demand for many items in this category. The Census data on
manufacturers' new orders for these goods have weakened after having moved
up in the first quarter, and the level of unfilled orders relative to shipments has
turned down after rising in the first half of 1999. The NAPM's diffusion index
for new orders has fallen considerably, and more purchasing managers are now
reporting declines in new orders than are reporting increases.7
With July's increase in overall output, the factory operating rate rose
1/4 percentage point to 81.6 percent. This is about equal to its long-term
average. Only a few industries--specifically, semiconductors, petroleum
products, nonferrous primary metals, and noncomputer industrial
machinery--are operating at rates near or above their last cyclical peak. Other
indicators also point to little tightness in the manufacturing sector--the index of
vendor performance in the NAPM survey has edged down (although it still
indicates that delivery times are lengthening), and purchasing managers listed
only electronic components as being in short supply.
Consumer Spending and Income
The limited data in hand suggest that consumer spending headed into the third
quarter at a somewhat faster pace than the 3 percent annual rate posted in the
second quarter. Nevertheless, we are not expecting to see a replay of the first
quarter, when purchases surged at an annual rate of more than 7-1/2 percent:
Although recent readings of consumer sentiment have held near historical highs,
real income growth has been moderate in recent quarters, and the stock market
has changed little on balance so far this year, suggesting that the impetus to
spending from wealth gains may have begun to wane.
Nominal retail sales in the control category of stores, which excludes
automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, increased
0.6 percent in July. Noticeable gains were recorded last month in sales at
general merchandisers, furniture and appliance stores, and eating and drinking
establishments. However, estimated retail purchases of motor vehicles
7. We cannot identify orders for specific industries in the NAPM survey. Currently, the
NAPM measure implies that orders are a very small drag on the growth in manufacturing
production (excluding motor vehicles). The real adjusted durable goods orders series derived
from the Census M3 data implies that orders are a small impetus to output, but this largely
reflects developments in the high-tech sector. Excluding high-tech items, both the NAPM- and
M3-based measures imply that orders currently are restraining production growth slightly. (In
regression models of manufacturing-sector output excluding motor vehicles and parts, the
NAPM's diffusion index for new orders and the M3-derived measure have about equal
explanatory power.)

(confidential) fell at an annual rate of nearly 250,000 units in July, leaving them
at their lowest level since April 1999. Combining these data with July's
increase in consumer prices, we estimate that real personal consumption
expenditures for all goods rose 0.5 percent last month.
As is often the case, much of the recent variation in PCE growth reflects
developments in the durable goods categories. We estimate that real purchases
of durable goods rose nearly 1 percent in July. This gain, however, followed a
dramatic second-quarter step-down in the pace of durable goods purchases from
the huge increases recorded in the preceding quarter: After having risen almost
24 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, real outlays for durable goods
fell about 4 percent in the second quarter. The deceleration in spending was led
by a decline in motor vehicle purchases, but expenditures for furniture and
appliances and household purchases of computers and software also grew at
lower rates last quarter.
The rise in services expenditures also moderated in the second quarter. But
excluding brokerage services (which fell nearly 10 percent at an annual rate
after having surged almost 80 percent in the first quarter), real spending on
services actually accelerated a touch--from 4 percent to 4-1/4 percent--between
the first and second quarters. More recently, real energy expenditures--which
rose briskly over the first half of the year--probably fell sharply in July as
temperatures for the country as a whole dropped below seasonal norms. And
last month's financial-market transaction volumes do not point to much strength
in brokerage services.
The moderation in the pace of real consumer spending appears to be consistent
with underlying fundamentals. Last quarter's lackluster stock market pulled the
ratio of net worth to disposable income down to a level a bit below that of the
fourth quarter of 1999. In addition, growth of real disposable personal income
has been relatively subdued in recent quarters: Over the first half of the year,
real DPI increased at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent, down only a bit from the
3 percent pace of 1999, but well below the more than 4-1/2 percent gains of
1998.8 Data in the employment report for July point to another moderate
increase in wage and salary disbursements last month.
In line with these two influences, there is some evidence that households'
expectations of future income gains may be ebbing: According to the Michigan
8. The shortfall of real DPI growth relative to GDP in 1999 and the first half of 2000 reflects
a variety of factors. First, consumption prices--which are used to deflate nominal
DPI--increased faster than overall GDP prices in 1999, reflecting, in part, developments in the
energy sector. Second, in the first half of 2000, wages and salaries did not accelerate, while
nominal GDP did. Third, effective tax rates have risen. Finally, growth in a number of smaller
categories of personal income has been relatively lackluster.

Survey Research Center (SRC), the index of expected income change over the
next twelve months has moved lower recently. Despite the deterioration in
income prospects, overall consumer sentiment--as measured by both the
Michigan SRC and Conference Board surveys--rose in July, suggesting that
households remain generally upbeat about current and future economic
conditions.
Housing Markets
Most of the principal housing-market indicators show weaker activity in the
single-family sector. On balance, mortgage rates have been running well above
last year's level, and the recent trends in stock-market wealth and employment
growth have likely damped demand this spring and summer. A small portion of
the decline in construction in recent months probably also reflects a return to
more normal weather.9
Single-family housing starts decreased 2 percent in July, to an annual rate of
1.2 million units. Starts have trended down steeply this year, and in July were
13 percent below the high level recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Over
this period, adjusted permits for single-family construction have declined about
in line with starts.
Sales of new homes fell in June to an annual rate of 829,000 units. This drop
left the pace of sales for the second quarter down nearly 8 percent from the first
quarter and 6 percent below the 1999 average. In contrast, sales of existing
homes rose 5-1/2 percent in the second quarter. The increase, however, merely
reversed a portion of earlier declines, and the pace of sales remains below last
year's average. Moreover, because of the usual lags in timing, we would be
particularly reluctant to read the recent rise in existing home sales as a response
to the drop in mortgage rates that has occurred since late May.10
Other housing indicators have also been soft, on balance. Builders' ratings of
new home sales ticked up in August but remained well off the high levels
recorded in mid-1999. The Michigan survey's measure of households'
perception of homebuying conditions also were up a bit in July--largely in
9. Based on quarterly averages of metropolitan statistical area precipitation and temperature
weighted by the amount of construction activity in each area, overall weather in the fourth
quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of this year was unusually mild, but averaged much closer to
normal in the second quarter of this year. On net, we estimate that weather pulled forward a
small amount of activity from the first two quarters of 2000 into the fourth quarter of 1999,
reducing the level of single-family starts by perhaps 10,000 units (annual rate) in the first quarter
and 15,000 units in the second quarter.
10. New home sales are recorded when sales contracts are signed, while existing home sales
are typically recorded when the sales are closed. We would therefore expect the response of
existing home sales to changing market conditions to lag behind the response of new home sales,
although the data do not always line up very well with this supposition.

response to declining mortgage rates--but still remained near a five-and-a-half-
year low. In contrast, the Mortgage Bankers' Association index of purchase
applications for home mortgages remained near the top of its range through
early August. The MBA series has continued to rise even as total sales of
single-family housing units have leveled off. However, as we noted in the June
Greenbook, this index likely has been boosted by expansion in the market share
of the large companies that are included in the MBA sample, as well as an
increasing incidence of multiple applications for mortgages; these developments
imply that the trends in the index likely do not reflect the underlying level of
housing demand. Finally, data from the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey
for August indicate that the demand for mortgages at commercial banks has
weakened moderately, on net, since May.
House prices appear to be rising briskly. The constant-quality new-home price
index, which controls for differences over time in house size, geography, and
several other important structural characteristics, rose at a year-over-year rate of
5-3/4 percent in the second quarter.11 The repeat-sales price index for existing
homes, which is also relatively unaffected by compositional changes, has been
accelerating, on net, since early 1995, and rose at a year-over-year rate of
6.9 percent in both the first and second quarters of this year. On net, overall
construction costs also appear to have picked up: The employment cost index
for construction has been accelerating--it rose 4-1/2 percent over the twelve
months ending in June--and the cost of land for homebuilding has increased in
recent years at an even faster rate.12 However, as measured by the PPI, the cost
of materials for construction has decelerated noticeably and was unchanged in
July from a year earlier.
In the multifamily sector, starts fell 7-1/2 percent to 315,000 units (annual rate)
in July. Starts averaged a 339,000 unit pace in the second quarter, which is
14 percent below the strong first-quarter reading but still a bit higher than the
average over all of last year. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units was
about unchanged in the second quarter from its year-ago level, and remained in
the much lower range that it has declined to over the past several years.
11. The year-over-year change in the average price of new homes moderated further in the
second quarter, but the rate of increase remained fairly elevated at about 5 percent. The average
price is influenced by shifts in the structural characteristics and geographic composition of new
homes sold. The fact that over the past several years the average price has tended to rise faster
than the constant-quality index is consistent with observed increases in the average size of
completed new homes.
12. Data for lot costs in 2000 are not yet available, but reports from builders suggest that the
rate of increase probably has not moderated.

Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Business spending on equipment and software has
continued to advance at a rapid clip: Real outlays increased at an annual rate of
21 percent in the second quarter, about the same pace as in the first quarter.
Real spending on high-tech equipment has accelerated this year, and investment
in industrial machinery has also been very strong. These developments reflect
the supportive environment for capital investment; notably, business output
growth has been brisk and corporate cash flow ample. While we have no direct
evidence on investment in the current quarter, the recent data on orders and
shipments of capital goods point toward another sizable gain in spending on
communications equipment, as well as solid increases in outlays for non-high-
tech equipment (outside of transportation equipment)--albeit at a more moderate
rate than in the first and second quarters.
Real expenditures on computing equipment advanced at an annual rate of
63 percent in the second quarter, the fastest quarterly growth rate since early
1998. This hefty increase was remarkable considering that the boost to real
spending from falling computer prices was weaker than it has been, on average,
in recent years; indeed, the 44 percent (annual rate) increase in nominal
computer spending last quarter was the fastest pace recorded since 1995. (The
smaller price declines apparently reflect the combination of high rates of
capacity utilization at many chip manufacturers and heavy demand.)
On the software side, the trend in business purchases have been stronger than we
had previously thought. After having incorporated new source data on the
software industry, the BEA now estimates that real business outlays on software
over the past three years increased at an average rate of 25 percent per
year--about 10 percentage points faster, on average, than was previously
indicated. When annual source data are unavailable, the BEA uses judgmental
trends in constructing its estimates of nominal software expenditures. These
trends are based on the recent performance of spending; accordingly, the
software revisions imply that the published series for equipment and software
spending will likely continue to increase at a faster pace in coming quarters.
Demand for communications equipment has also been exceptionally strong of
late. Real spending in this category decelerated, as a blistering 68 percent first-
quarter rise gave way to "only" a 26 percent increase in the second quarter.
Outlays for communications equipment appear to be poised for another
substantial increase. Bookings have been very strong in recent months--they
surged 27 percent in June, for example--adding to a substantial backlog of
unfilled orders. Indeed, some major manufacturers of communications gear,
such as Lucent, are reported to be having difficulties in raising production fast
enough to meet the exploding demand for cutting-edge fiber-optic technologies.

Nonetheless, while the increasing order backlog could reflect some bottleneck
problems, capacity utilization rates for domestic communications equipment
producers as a whole are only slightly above historical norms.
The volatile transportation sector provided a moderate boost to overall business
spending in the second quarter, as a large increase in domestic aircraft
expenditures offset a drop in motor vehicle outlays. We do not yet have much
hard information on current-quarter domestic spending on aircraft, and the
incoming data on business demand for motor vehicles have been mixed. Sales
of light vehicles to fleets (confidential) were up noticeably in July, after holding
steady in the second quarter. By contrast, sales of medium and heavy trucks
dropped sharply in July to their lowest level since September 1998. Industry
contacts continue to report poor profitability due to higher fuel prices, interest
rates, wages, and insurance costs, and the stock of heavy trucks (both new and
used) remains large. Net orders for heavy trucks have remained soft over the
past several months, and backlogs fell in June to below 100,000 units for the
first time in three years. Although net new orders for medium trucks rose in
July to their highest level of the year, they still are below 1998's record level.
Real spending on equipment outside of the high-tech and transportation
categories increased at an annual rate of 16 percent in the second quarter,
following a 15 percent advance in the first quarter. This strength reflected
higher outlays in a wide range of categories, including industrial machinery,
construction machinery, business furniture, and engines and turbines. The
increase in spending on engines and turbines so far this year likely reflects the
large number of orders placed for gas turbines in 1998; delivery lags for these
items are a couple of years long. Orders for engines and turbines have also been
running at high levels in recent months; these goods accounted for most of
June's increase in non-high-tech, non-transportation orders as well as for all of
the recent increase in unfilled orders for this subcategory of equipment. With
the exception of turbines, orders in this aggregate have been edging down of
late.
Nonresidential structures. Real investment in nonresidential structures is
estimated to have declined at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the second
quarter following a 22 percent surge in the first quarter.13 The latest
construction put-in-place data--which cover June--were weak. But given their
volatility and tendency toward large revisions, these data provide little reliable
13. The second-quarter figures are staff estimates of what BEA will publish when it revises
its advance NIPA numbers to reflect the latest construction-put-in-place data. The nonresidential
construction-put-in-place data for June were well below the assumption BEA made in estimating
second-quarter GDP, and the data for April and May were revised down as well. These
differences imply a downward revision of about $10 billion to BEA's estimate of second-quarter
real spending on nonresidential structures.

information regarding underlying trends, and, on balance, the fundamentals in
this sector appear consistent with moderate gains in activity.
The construction of office buildings remains an area of strength. Real
expenditures for office construction increased at an annual rate of 14-1/2 percent
in the second quarter, leaving spending 10 percent above its year-earlier level.
Construction of other commercial structures (which include retail space and
warehouses) has been fairly flat, on balance, since the mid 1990s. Recently,
investment in buildings of this type has been volatile, falling at an annual rate of
18 percent in the second quarter after having risen at a 21 percent pace in the
first quarter. Real outlays for industrial construction plummeted last year but
have rebounded sharply of late, rising at an annual rate of 19 percent in the
second quarter. Nevertheless, the pace of construction in this sector remains
well below the rates seen in the mid-1990s.
Business Inventories
We estimate that the real stock of nonfarm inventories increased at an annual
rate of $70 billion last quarter, up from a $33 billion pace in the first quarter of
the year.14 About $14 billion of the second quarter's accumulation occurred in
the motor vehicle sector, where stocks are now running at uncomfortably high
levels. Elsewhere, despite a faster pace of stockbuilding, only a few instances of
inventory overhangs are apparent.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased at an annual rate of
$28.8 billion in June. For the second quarter as a whole, manufacturing stocks
rose at a $23.5 billion rate, a touch faster than the $22.0 billion pace recorded in
the first quarter. Excluding aircraft--and thus the swings in inventories
associated with the Boeing strike--second-quarter inventory investment was
$29 billion, up from $19 billion in the first quarter. However, with non-aircraft
manufacturing shipments increasing 1.4 percent, the inventory-shipments ratio
was left unchanged at 1.17 months, and stocks appear to be at comfortable
levels in most industries. An exception is the construction materials and
supplies grouping, for which demand has slowed in recent months and the
inventory-shipments ratio has reached a four-year high.
The book value of non-auto wholesale inventories rose at an annual rate of
$33-1/2 billion in the second quarter, up from a $21-1/2 billion pace in the first
quarter. The inventory-sales ratio for this sector has edged up a touch in recent
months, but evidence of unwanted accumulation is limited despite slower
growth in sales, which fell from a first-quarter pace of a little over 12 percent
14. This figure is about $15 billion stronger than BEA had assumed when preparing the
advance estimate of second-quarter GDP.

(annual rate) to a 7-3/4 percent rate in the second quarter. One exception is steel
service centers, where reports of inventory overhangs continue.
Non-auto retail inventories rose $18 billion in book-value terms in June, and the
inventory-sales ratio for this grouping--which had fallen rapidly over the early
part of this year--edged up to 1.34 months, the same level as recorded in
January. The increases in inventory-sales ratios in the second quarter were
largely concentrated among retailers that saw a sharp slowdown in sales, most
notably building materials stores, but also apparel outlets, furniture dealers, and
stores selling "other durable goods" such as sports products, toys, and jewelry.
Nonetheless, despite these increases in inventory-sales ratios, retail stocks are
still very lean by historical standards, and the June ratio appears about consistent
with the downward trend seen since early 1998.
Government Expenditures
Federal government. Federal budget prospects continue to look bright.
According to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement, the budget surplus over the
twelve months ending in June totaled $207 billion--about $110 billion larger
than the surplus posted over the same period a year ago--as robust increases in
tax receipts far exceeded the pace of outlays. Moreover, new budget projections
by the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office call for significantly
higher surpluses under current services than were forecast last winter.
After taking account of legislation enacted through mid-June, OMB estimated
that the fiscal year 2000 surplus would reach $224 billion, and CBO estimated a
surplus of $232 billion; a surplus of $119 billion was realized in fiscal 1999.
Looking further ahead, both OMB and CBO project that the total unified surplus
would rise from about 2-1/2 percent of GDP this year to above 4 percent of GDP
over the next ten years if discretionary spending were held constant in real terms
and if receipts and mandatory spending were to evolve according to current law.
The on-budget surplus, which excludes social security and the Postal Service, is
projected to rise from roughly 1 percent of GDP in fiscal 2001 to 2-1/2 percent
of GDP by 2010. The current projections for this fiscal year are roughly
$50 billion higher than those made last winter, and by 2010, the upward
revisions increase to about $200 billion. New economic assumptions are
responsible for the lion's share of the revisions; in addition, effective tax rates
were raised, consistent with this spring's surprisingly strong tax collections.
With regard to recent budget legislation, a supplemental appropriations bill for
fiscal year 2000 was enacted in early July. The bill is projected to boost
spending by $3 billion in fiscal 2000 and by $4 billion in fiscal 2001; the
increase will mainly fund military operations in Kosovo. In addition, the bill

shifted $10 billion of spending from fiscal 2001 into fiscal 2000. Congress also
passed two tax cuts: a phased-in repeal of the estate and gift tax, and a bill that
would mitigate the so-called marriage penalty. The President has vetoed the
marriage tax relief bill and has promised to veto the estate tax bill. Elsewhere,
legislation to boost the minimum wage and to cut business taxes has passed the
House and awaits Senate action.
State and local governments. Real purchases by state and local governments
were little changed in the second quarter after having posted unusually rapid
increases during the fall and winter. The source of the slowdown can be traced
to construction spending and appears to owe in large part to the unusually dry
and mild weather that facilitated work--especially on highways--during the late
fall and winter. State and local employment, which provides the first piece of
third-quarter data for this sector, rose 39,000 in July; this was well above the
average monthly increase seen during the first half of the year.
According to two recent surveys, both city and state governments continue to
enjoy very sound fiscal conditions. Measured as a share of expenditures,
general-fund ending balances of both states and cities remain elevated.15
Moreover, since 1994, ending balances have been coming in well above what
states and cities had projected at the beginning of their fiscal years. In response
to their improved fiscal positions, state governments have saved money in their
reserve accounts and have enacted a record amount of tax cuts. The rate of
spending by city governments has trended up since the mid-1990s, and while
many cities have added new fees and charges, they have done so at a much-
reduced pace relative to that seen earlier in the decade.
Prices
The data received since the June Greenbook are broadly consistent with an
acceleration in prices. The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in July
following an increase of 0.6 percent in June. The June figure was pushed up by
a surge in energy prices, while in July the index for energy was about flat. Food
prices were about unchanged in June but jumped in July. Over the past twelve
months, the headline CPI rose 3.5 percent, considerably faster than the
2.1 percent pace that prevailed a year earlier; an acceleration in energy prices
contributed importantly to the pickup. Outside of food and energy, prices
increased 0.2 percent in both June and July and were up 2.4 percent over the
past year. The core CPI has accelerated nearly 0.5 percentage point in the past
15. The state report includes all states except Massachusetts, while the city survey is based
on a sample of 1,060 large and medium-sized cities (of which a third responded). The general
funds are the largest funds of state and city governments; they do not include capital spending
and account for roughly 50 percent of total outlays. Ending balances are the resources left in the
general fund at the end of the year.

year (current-methods basis); excluding tobacco, the acceleration was
2/3 percentage point.
Core commodity prices edged down a touch, on balance over the past two
months and were up 0.4 percent over the past year--a little less than the pace of
a year ago. However, absent tobacco prices--which decelerated sharply over the
past twelve months after surging in late 1998--the pickup in core commodity
inflation over the past year was almost 1/2 percentage point.16 Over the past
two months, prices of new vehicles changed little and were up just 0.4 percent
from a year ago, as the Big Three have kept incentives elevated in an attempt to
mitigate inventory imbalances and secure higher market shares. Although this
pace of increase was modest, it represented a 1 percentage point pickup from the
year-earlier period.
The CPI for non-energy services increased 0.2 percent in July after an increase
of 0.3 percent in June. Over the past year, these prices were up 3.3 percent,
0.6 percentage point more than in the year-earlier period. The acceleration
owed to faster price increases for many service items, including medical care
and airfares. The acceleration in airfares owed in part to the rise in fuel costs.
Over the four quarters ended in 2000:Q2, the core CPI rose 2.3 percent--
0.6 percentage point faster than the increase in core PCE prices.17 With regard
to recent quarterly movements, core PCE prices rose about 1 percentage point
less than the core CPI in the second quarter, following a first-quarter increase
that was similar to the CPI's. The narrowing of the gap in the first quarter
occurred mainly because the prices of items that are included in PCE but not in
the CPI rose more rapidly than is typical, pushing up core PCE inflation relative
to core CPI inflation.18 In the second quarter, prices for these "out-of-scope"
items increased a little more slowly than is typical. One item that was
particularly important was imputed charges for commercial bank services
(which account for about 2-1/2 percent of total personal consumption); the price
for this component of PCE jumped 17-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first
quarter but then increased at a much slower 4 percent pace in the second quarter.
In addition to giving different readings on the level of inflation, the core PCE
price index and the CPI present somewhat different pictures of the pattern of
inflation over time. In particular, during the four quarters through 2000:Q2,
16. The major tobacco companies hiked the wholesale price of cigarettes by 6 cents per pack
at the very end of July, which should show up in the August CPI.
17. In 1998 and 1999, the gap between core CPI inflation (measured on a current-methods
basis) and core PCE inflation averaged a bit below 0.6 percentage point. Prior to the annual
NIPA revision, the gap was a little larger.
18. Many of these items do not have market prices, and the BEA relies on a variety of
sources and techniques to estimate their price.

core PCE prices accelerated 0.3 percentage point less than the core CPI (on a
current-methods basis), while in the prior four quarters the pattern was reversed,
with core PCE prices accelerating noticeably more than the core CPI. Swings of
this magnitude in the relative patterns of acceleration are not unusual and often
owe to movements in the prices of out-of-scope items, as mentioned above.
Recently, however, the divergence largely stems from differences in the prices
used for some individual items in each measure. For example, the BEA uses
PPIs for physician services and for-profit hospitals instead of CPIs in
constructing the PCE price index. In combination, these PPIs did not accelerate
over the past year--contributing to the relatively flat pattern of core PCE
inflation--while the corresponding CPIs accelerated considerably.
Outside of the consumer sector, capital goods prices have shown clear signs of
accelerating. Although the PPI for capital equipment was essentially
unchanged in June and July, this index has risen 1.2 percent over the past twelve
months, up more than 1 percentage point from its year-earlier pace. Prices have
accelerated for motor vehicles, aircraft, and a range of other capital goods. In
addition, a small part of this overall acceleration is the result of a slower rate of
decline in computer prices; these prices fell 16 percent during the past year,
compared with an average decline of nearly 24 percent over the preceding two
years.
This firming of investment prices has contributed to an acceleration in the
broader price indexes. The chain price index for gross domestic purchases
excluding food and energy rose 1.8 percent over the four quarters ended in the
second quarter of 2000, up 0.3 percentage point from a year earlier.
Inflation has been mixed at earlier stages of processing. The PPI for
intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent further in
July, extending a long string of increases in this series. Over the past twelve
months, this index has risen 2.8 percent, up considerably from the year-earlier
period, when these prices were flat. In contrast, the PPI for core crude goods
fell 1.8 percent in July after having dropped 1.3 percent in June; despite recent
declines, these prices are up 7-1/2 percent over the past year. Since the mid-July
pricing date for the PPI, the Journal of Commerce index of industrial
commodities has changed little, on balance, as declines in prices of plywood and
some metals--including steel scrap--were offset by increases elsewhere.
Although not included in the Journal of Commerce index, prices of crops and
livestock have moved lower, as well, since mid-July.
As for inflation expectations, the median response to the University of Michigan
survey of one-year ahead inflation expectations was 3.0 percent in July, the
same as the average over the first half of the year. These expectations are up
about 1/4 percentage point from a year ago. The five-to-ten-year median

expectation came in at 2.8 percent in July; longer-run expectations have
remained quite stable over the past couple of years.
Energy price developments. Energy prices have played a key role in the
acceleration of the CPI since the start of the year. Increases in gasoline prices
have been particularly large, driven by low inventories and supply disruptions.
In early June, the Midwest was hit by gasoline pipeline breakdowns, and
refiners ran into major difficulties in blending ethanol into gasoline to meet
environmental standards for the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. As a result,
refiners' profit margins for gasoline rose to exceptionally high levels in the
region. Since June, however, supplies of oxygenated gasoline have poured into
the Midwest, and gasoline prices in that area have plunged at both the wholesale
and retail levels. As of early August, the spread between retail gasoline prices
and crude oil costs had returned to a more normal level for the country as a
whole.
Production difficulties have been less severe for heating oil, although
inventories have been lean for quite some time. As of the end of July, distillate
inventories constituted about 28 days of wintertime supply, below the July norm
of about 33 days. This suggests that even typical weather this coming winter
could strain supplies and boost prices. However, heating oil is a relatively small
fraction of total oil demand, even in the winter, and a moderate boost in refinery
output could put inventories back in line with demand rather promptly--indeed,
futures quotes show little indication that a heating-oil shortfall is anticipated.
Tight supplies and rising prices have also characterized the market for natural
gas over the past year. Growth in gas supplies has been disappointing, and
levels of natural gas in storage are below the norm for this time of year. That
said, at current rates of accumulation, storage levels at the start of the winter
heating season will be closer to normal than was the case last November. If the
winter turns out to be no colder than usual, this level of inventory should be
enough to avoid any significant supply disruptions. Nonetheless, futures prices
for this winter remain in the same high range seen at the time of the June
Greenbook.
Electricity demand has soared over the past year along with rapid economic
growth. The power generation and transmission system has not expanded to
keep pace, especially in the West. As a result, spells of hot weather this summer
have driven California spot prices to unusually high levels. Residential prices
remain partially regulated in most of California and the rest of the country,
limiting the response of residential electric rates to spot-price increases. Given
the usual drop in air-conditioning demand for electricity at summer's end,
capacity should be more than adequate for the fourth quarter; in addition,
substantial new generating capacity is due to come on line in 2001. Still,

whether electrical generation and transmission capacity will be sufficient to
avoid further spot-price spikes next summer is an open question.
Labor Costs
Recent data indicate that both the ECI and productivity and cost (P&C)
measures of hourly compensation increased more than 4-1/2 percent over the
past year. Although the specific pattern of acceleration differs across the two
series, both show a net pickup in labor costs over the past five or so years.
The ECI rose especially sharply over the first half of this year, leaving the
twelve-month change 1-1/4 percentage points above its pace of a year ago. This
acceleration in the ECI has been widespread across industries and occupations.
Although the ECI for wages and salaries has accelerated about 1/2 percentage
point, the bigger jump has occurred in benefit costs inflation, which rose
5-3/4 percent over the past year--more than 3 percentage points faster than over
the year-earlier period. Health insurance costs have been a noticeable source of
the acceleration in benefit costs, but increases in the other major categories have
picked up as well.19
The jump in the ECI brings its rate of increase into line with the P&C measure
of hourly compensation, which is now reported to have risen at around
4-3/4 percent over the past four quarters and in the year-earlier period. The
P&C data incorporate information from the annual NIPA revision. Two aspects
of this revision warrant further comment. First, with little change to the 1998
rate of increase and an upward revision in 1999, this measure is now reported to
show less deceleration between 1998 and 1999 than was reported prior to the
NIPA revision. Even so, increases in P&C hourly compensation still show a
surge in 1998 that is difficult to explain fully. Second, even though the rate of
increase in compensation per hour was revised up in 1999, productivity growth
was also marked up, implying little revision to the growth rate of unit labor
costs last year.
The July employment report provided the first look at wage developments in the
third quarter. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers
increased 0.4 percent in July. Over the past twelve months, this series increased
3.7 percent, about the same pace as in the year-earlier period. Over long spans
of time, movements in average hourly earnings are similar to those in the
corresponding ECI series for wages and salaries of workers in production and
19. In June, BLS expanded the definition of benefits in the ECI to include hiring and referral
bonuses. Because BLS merely added these new components to the June level of compensation,
their inclusion induces a small discontinuity in the ECI. A rough calculation performed by the
BLS suggests that adding these new components of bonuses could have boosted the level of total
civilian compensation by "at most" a penny per hour. A one-cent increase in hourly
compensation translates to 0.2 percentage point on the quarterly change (at an annual rate).

nonsupervisory occupations. However, rates of increase in these series can
deviate noticeably, and significant differences have occurred in the past couple
of years.
Agricultural Developments
Although drought has afflicted some farming areas this season, total harvests are
once again likely to be sizable. Indeed, the first estimates of this year's harvest
based on field surveys by the USDA suggest that corn production may be about
3 percent higher and soybean production about 9 percent higher than previous
peaks. As a result, stocks of these commodities are expected to rise further.
Given these projected harvests, grain prices have fallen almost to last summer's
depressed levels; the cumulative decline over the past couple of months has
reduced the price of corn by roughly one-third and the price of soybeans by
roughly one-fifth. Moreover, because of a glut of cattle that have been fattened
for slaughter, prices for these animals fell sharply over the first part of August.
Finally, prices for chickens are near the low end of the range seen over the past
decade, and supplies are ample. Politicians have reacted to the low crop prices
by providing additional income subsidies of more than $5 billion, while
drought-stricken farmers in some areas in the western Great Plains and along
parts of the Gulf Coast have also been given access to emergency funds for
drought relief.

Appendix
The Annual Revision to the National Income and Product Accounts
On July 29, the BEA published its regular annual revision to the national income and
product accounts. The revision, which extended back to 1997, incorporated more
comprehensive source data, including the 1997 Economic Census, the 1997 Census of
Governments, annual business surveys from the Census, new information from the
OMB and the USDA, unemployment insurance records, updated international
transactions accounts, and tabulations of tax returns. In addition, the BEA began using
new source data for employer-provided health insurance.
Revisions to GDP and its Components
From the fourth quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of this year, the average annual rate
of growth in real GDP was revised up 0.1 percentage point. On a fourth-quarter to
fourth-quarter basis, growth was revised up 0.2 percentage point in 1997, down
0.1 percentage point in 1998, and up 0.4 percentage point in 1999. With regard to the
quarterly pattern, the most notable revisions were a 1 percentage point boost to growth
in the fourth quarter of 1999--to 8.3 percent at an annual rate--and a 3/4 percentage
point downward revision to the first quarter of 2000-to a 4.8 percent annual rate.
Real growth in business fixed investment is now 1.4 percentage points per year higher,
on average, than before, with most of the revision reflecting stronger software spending.
The new data on software incorporated by the BEA--the 1997 Economic Census, the
1998 Service Annual Survey, and BLS wage and hours-worked data for computer
programmers and systems analysts--all pointed to larger increases in nominal software
expenditures than in the earlier estimates. The growth rate of residential investment
spending was revised down an average of 0.9 percentage point per year over the
revision period, reflecting updated construction data. Revisions to the other
components of GDP were small.
Income-Side Developments
On the whole, real gross domestic income was little modified over the revision period.
Sizable downward revisions to corporate profits and compensation were about offset by
large upward revisions to net interest income and the consumption of fixed capital.
With GDP revised up and GDI little changed, the large gap between them (the statistical
discrepancy) was reduced somewhat in this revision.
The ratio of profits to gross national product was revised down throughout the revision
period. Much of the downward revision to profits was in the financial sector, where tax
records showed lower profits at investment companies. Among nonfinancial firms,
profits were revised down most in the transportation and public utilities industry. The
personal saving rate was unchanged on balance over the revision period.
Compensation and Prices
Growth in nonfarm business compensation per hour revised down, on net, over the
revision period. Four-quarter changes in compensation per hour were revised down
about 1 percentage point in 1997, left essentially unrevised in 1998, and revised up
about 1/2 percentage point in 1999. The large downward revision in 1997 mainly
reflected the incorporation of source data from a new survey--the Medical Expenditure

Panel Survey from the Department of Health and Human Services--to estimate
employer-provided health insurance.' The data from the survey point to a lower level of
the "other labor income" component of compensation, which the BEA folded directly
into its estimates of the level of total compensation beginning in 1997. However,
because the data for 1996 were unrevised, the growth rate of compensation per hour in
1997 was held artificially low; a rough calculation by the staff suggests that if the new
data had been incorporated in 1996 as well, the growth rate in 1997 would have been
revised down only 1/3 percentage point.
Four-quarter changes in core PCE prices were little revised in 1997, revised up about
0.3 percentage point in 1998, and essentially unrevised, on balance, in 1999.2 For 1998,
the upward revisions were concentrated in the prices of an assortment of service items,
including brokerage services, imputed charges for bank services, and the religion and
welfare category.
BLS's Annual Revisions to Productivity
On August 8, the BLS released updated estimates of productivity, which incorporate the
new GDP data as well as the annual revision to the payroll employment survey released
in June. The new figures show that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose
at an annual rate of 2.9 percent between the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter
of this year, the same pace as was estimated prior to the revision. However, the pattern
within that period was altered: Productivity growth was revised up a bit in 1997, down
in 1998 and early 1999, and up again over the past several quarters.
1. This survey was first taken in 1996.
2. Quarterly changes (at annual rates) in core PCE prices were revised up between 0.2 and
0.4 percentage point from 1997:Q4 through 1999:Q1. In 1999:Q4, the quarterly rate of change
was revised down about 0.3 percentage point.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Most nominal interest rates have declined moderately since the June FOMC
meeting, with incoming news on the economy seen as indicating that growth is
slowing to a more sustainable pace and that inflation remains contained. As a
consequence, the term structure of interest rates does not appear to incorporate
any further tightening in the stance of monetary policy. Stock prices have risen
a little on net over the intermeeting period, as the boost from lower interest rates
has been tempered by corporate announcements pointing to a less buoyant
outlook for profits.
Business borrowing has remained robust, and the pace of equity offerings has
picked up of late to meet large and growing external financing needs.
Households, too, have continued to borrow at a strong pace, with both consumer
and mortgage debt expanding briskly. By contrast, the burgeoning federal
surplus has allowed the Treasury to pay down debt at a rapid clip, and net
borrowing by state and local governments has remained subdued. With
borrowing strong at banks, bank credit and M3 have continued to advance
rapidly. However, previous increases in market interest rates have damped the
recent growth of M2 relative to its pace earlier this year.
Interest Rates and Stock Prices
Market participants had largely anticipated the FOMC's decisions at its June
meeting to leave the intended federal funds rate unchanged and to reiterate that
risks remained weighted toward heightened inflation pressures. Nonetheless,
interest rates fell a bit following the announcement, as some market participants
reportedly read the accompanying statement as suggesting a reduced likelihood
of additional tightening. The expected path of the federal funds rate has shifted
down further over the intermeeting period; incoming data and the Chairman's
semiannual monetary policy testimony on July 20 apparently reinforced the
notion that the economic expansion was slowing to a more sustainable pace.
Federal funds and eurodollar futures rates have declined about 10 to 30 basis
points since the June meeting, and the September federal funds futures rate
suggests that market participants see virtually no chance of a policy tightening at
next week's meeting. Moreover, futures quotes further out the curve indicate
that investors believe no further tightening is in train.
Reflecting this revision to the outlook for policy, yields on nominal Treasury
coupon securities and longer-term private obligations have declined as much as

30 basis points over the intermeeting period.' Yields on ten-year swaps, agency
benchmark securities, and investment-grade corporate bonds fell about as much
as those on comparable Treasury securities, on net, over the intermeeting period.
However, junk bond yields fell less, on balance, reflecting continued concerns
about potential problems of riskier firms in a slowing economy.
Stock prices surged over the first half of the intermeeting period as expectations
of additional policy restraint unwound. However, those gains were largely
reversed when a number of prominent firms, primarily in the
telecommunications portion of the technology sector, warned that their earnings
over the second half of the year were not likely to meet analysts' expectations.
The Nasdaq ended the intermeeting period about where it began, with prices of
telecommunications stocks down substantially. Broader indexes are up about
2 percent on balance over the intermeeting period.
Business Finance
With nearly all firms having reported, profit growth for the S&P 500 in the
second quarter appears to have been strong, although below the pace of the
previous two quarters. Earnings per share in the second quarter rose about
15 percent from a year earlier, down from the 20 percent gains reported for the
two previous quarters. While profits of nonfinancial businesses, especially
those in the technology sector, continued to grow at a brisk pace, those in the
financial sector slowed significantly, largely owing to sluggish bank profits.2
The latest information on credit quality revealed little deterioration for most
firms but reinforced existing concerns about lower-rated nonfinancial firms.
While junk bond defaults eased in June and July from the record level in May,
the annual default rate measured on a year-to-date basis through July remained
higher than any other annual level since 1991. Default rates are expected to
continue to rise over the next year because of the seasoning of the slug of junk
bonds issued before the market turmoil in late 1998 and because of the higher
asset volatility of a number of issuers. The ratio of liabilities of failed
businesses to total business liabilities remained high through July. However,
ratings changes suggest a small improvement in overall credit quality, as
Moody's upgraded $50 billion of corporate debt on net in June and July. The
1. In contrast to most other yields, Treasury bill rates have trended higher since the June
FOMC meeting. However, these increases appear to reflect primarily a reversal of the
unexpected and difficult-to-explain declines posted in relatively illiquid markets over the
previous intermeeting period.
2. Net income of the forty-four large bank holding companies that reported earnings in July
fell 30 percent relative to a year earlier. The drop reflected a combined $3.5 billion net loss at
First Union and Bank One, with a one-time restructuring charge by First Union accounting for
most of this loss. Net income at the remaining forty-two bank holding companies rose
5-1/2 percent over the second quarter of 1999, still a significant slowdown in profitability that
largely reflected an increase in noninterest expense.

amount of debt on the watchlist is evenly split between upgrades and
downgrades.
Conditions in the corporate bond market have continued to improve over the
intermeeting period. Investors welcomed large issues by investment-grade
firms, including enormous offerings under the benchmark debt programs of
Ford and Fannie Mae. In addition, buyers reportedly have been more willing to
buy debt with longer-dated maturities; several large issuers sold thirty-year
bonds, a segment of the market that had been nearly dormant since April.
Issuance by investment-grade firms eased in July from the rapid pace set in
June, but issuance to date in August suggests a return to more robust activity.
Proceeds from a number of recent bond issues have been used to fund merger
and acquisition activity. The recovery in the junk sector of the bond market has
also been notable, with a rebound in issuance in June and July. Looking ahead,
junk bond offerings are expected to be buoyed in coming quarters by strong
needs to fund high-technology infrastructure.
Firms also raised substantial sums in the commercial paper market in both June
and July, largely to provide short-term financing to complete mergers. In
contrast, firms' reliance on business loans from banks slowed noticeably over
that period, perhaps because they found the capital markets more receptive.
Meanwhile, a significant fraction of banks in the latest Senior Loan Officer
Opinion Survey reported continued tightening of both standards and terms on
business loans over the past three months, and most said that tightening was due
to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook. On balance, overall
borrowing by businesses was relatively large again in July, about matching the
second-quarter rate.
Gross equity issuance picked up in June and July as stock price volatility
retreated. Offerings of seasoned issues rose somewhat, while IPOs increased
considerably. Indeed, while offer prices on most IPOs in the second quarter had
to be reduced to be sold, two-thirds of firms in July were able to price their
offerings above their filing ranges. The average first-day return on new issues
also shot up. Optical telecommunications equipment has been the hottest IPO
sector; biotechnology and Internet software companies have also generally been
well received by investors. The upcoming calendar for IPOs remains packed, as
firms have been waiting to take advantage of an improvement in market tone.
In addition, despite heightened market volatility early in the second quarter,
venture capitalists appear to have continued to finance startups at a near-record
pace, with most of the funds going to Internet-related firms. Venture capital
investments surpassed funds raised by initial public offerings in the first half of
the year.
Merger activity has remained strong, especially in the telecommunications
sector. Merger-related equity retirements were substantial in the second quarter

and will likely continue at a brisk pace in the months ahead. About half of the
deals announced in the second quarter will be financed with cash, up from
10 percent to 20 percent on average over the past two years, a shift reflecting a
decline in the share of deals involving high-technology companies and an
increase in the share involving the "old economy" firms. In addition, the
announced acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign firms will lead to sizable
merger-related retirements of U.S. equity. Equity retirements related to stock
buyback programs should continue to be near the elevated pace observed over
the past year as the record level of announced repurchases in the first quarter by
"old economy" firms is completed.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Interest rates on loans and securities used to finance commercial real estate have
moved down with other long-term rates. Interest rates on commercial mortgage
loans dropped about 30 basis points over June and July, while yields on AAA-
rated commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have fallen about
50 basis points over those months, leaving the spread relative to swap rates
about unchanged.
CMBS issuance was heavy in June, pushing the second-quarter volume above
$12 billion, compared with about $8 billion in the first quarter. Issuance in the
third quarter is expected to be near the second-quarter pace. The rapid issuance
reflects securitization of a large stockpile of loans that accumulated earlier in the
year when market conditions deteriorated. Commercial mortgage debt from all
sources apparently expanded at about an 8-1/2 percent annual rate in the second
quarter, down from 10 percent in the first quarter. A slowdown in commercial
bank lending in July suggests that a further deceleration may be in train for the
third quarter.
Delinquency rates for commercial mortgages in securitized pools remained near
their historic lows through June. Data for insurance companies indicate that
delinquencies on their loan portfolios held at very low levels in the second
quarter. Nonetheless, senior loan officers reported in the August survey that
they had firmed credit conditions further.
Household Finance
Judging from mutual fund flows, households continued to direct a substantial
portion of saving into equity investments in recent months, despite the less
ebullient stock market. Investors continued to favor capital appreciation funds
(whose assets tend to be relatively concentrated in technology stocks) over less
risky total return funds. Bond funds experienced small inflows in June and July,
their first of the year.
Consumer loan rates have registered mixed changes since the June FOMC
meeting. Rates on new auto loans at banks have risen about 10 basis points, and

rates on new car loans at the captive auto finance companies--though still
substantially lower than bank rates--have also edged up in recent months. Rates
on adjustable-rate mortgages have changed little, while those on fixed-rate
mortgages have fallen with bond yields.
Growth of household debt in the second quarter appears to have been in line
with its rapid pace of the past two quarters. Consumer credit continued to
expand at a robust 10 percent annual rate in the second quarter, while mortgage
debt growth is estimated to have edged up slightly from its first quarter pace of
7 percent.
The household debt-service burden has trended upward with interest rates and
rapid debt growth, and is currently at its highest point since its mid-1980s peak.
However, current measures of household credit quality have yet to show signs
of deterioration. Delinquency rates on new-car loans at captive finance
companies remained low in June. The Moody's index of delinquencies on
credit card loans in securitized pools continued to be at a low level through
June.3 Meanwhile, in the latest Senior Loan Officer Survey, banks reported that
standards and terms on all types of consumer and mortgage loans were
essentially unchanged.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury's mid-quarter refunding announcement on August 2 included no
changes to the planned auction schedule. The lack of change surprised some
market participants, who had expected an announcement of a future termination
of the thirty-year bond auctions, and that security's yield rose in response. The
Treasury again noted that it was considering eliminating the one-year bill. To
that end, it is working with the Congress to revise a number of statutory
provisions that reference the one-year yield for the purpose of setting interest
rates on various contracts, such as student loans.
The Treasury announced that it will continue its twice-monthly buyback
operations. It confirmed that it will repurchase up to $30 billion this year, and
said it would include callable securities in the program. In June and July, the
Treasury bought back $7 billion of securities, bringing the total repurchased
since the start of the buyback program in March to $17.5 billion. These
operations have proceeded smoothly. In addition, the Treasury paid down about
$40 billion of maturing obligations in June and July, and is on track to pay down
around $225 billion this fiscal year.
3. The decline of 17 basis points from April to May appears to be mostly caused by a change
in reporting methods by a few large issuers. The time after which loans are charged off was
changed in May from 180 days to 150 days on pools issued by Bank One, First USA, and First
Chicago. As a result, delinquencies were pushed down and charge-offs were pushed up as more
loans were affected by the new limit.

In part to offset actual and expected redemptions of bills by the System Open
Market Account, the Treasury increased the sizes of the weekly three- and six-
month bill auctions by $2 billion in July and said it expects further increases
over the balance of the year.4 In early August, the Treasury auctioned
$25 billion in the mid-quarter refunding--including new ten-year notes and
reopenings of the five-year note and the thirty-year bond--all of which were well
received. It also plans to issue two cash management bills in August to bridge
seasonal lows in its cash position until the mid-September tax date.
Liquidity in the markets for Treasury securities was little changed over the
intermeeting period. Market participants continued to turn away from the thirty-
year Treasury bond as a benchmark for pricing and hedging, relying
increasingly on the ten-year note and on interest rate swaps and GSE securities.
Reflecting this change, open interest on the CBOT Treasury bond futures
contract in July was 40 percent below its year-earlier level.
The tone in the market for GSE securities was relatively upbeat over the
intermeeting period. Market participants generally do not expect congressional
action this year that would materially change the relationship between the GSEs
and the government. Fannie Mae's issuance of $11-1/2 billion of securities in
early August--the largest bond sale in U.S. history outside of Treasuries--was
well received.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds in July remained well below the
robust pace of the past two years. Refunding offerings continued to be
relatively sparse, as the net rise in interest rates over the past year has made it
unprofitable to refund older debt. In addition, swollen tax revenues have
continued to hold down the need to raise new funds even as capital spending has
been brisk; the result has been a smaller-than-usual seasonal bounce in new
capital issuance in June, followed by a decline in July. With a large offset from
debt retirement associated with prior advance refundings, net issuance has been
meager.
Credit quality remains strong in the municipal market, with the exception of the
health care sector. With their revenues under pressure from government and
managed-care reimbursement policies, not-for-profit health care providers
account for a large share of downgrades. Yields on municipal bonds moved
slightly more than taxable yields over the intermeeting period, leaving the ratios
of municipal yields to Treasuries and to Aaa corporate bonds down slightly on
balance.
4. These redemptions relate to recently announced limits on the percentage of outstanding
individual Treasury bill and coupon issues held by the System Open Market Account.

Money and Bank Credit
M2 grew moderately in July; its 3-1/4 percent rate of expansion was only about
half the pace registered on average over the first two quarters of the year. Flows
into small time deposits remained brisk, reflecting their relatively attractive
rates, but their growth has likely been at the expense of other M2 components.
M2 expansion has been held down by sluggish currency growth--which seems
due at least in part to relatively weak foreign demand--as well as by weakness in
retail money market mutual funds. Despite a widening in their opportunity cost,
growth of liquid deposits rebounded somewhat in July after posting essentially
no gain in June.5 Available data for August suggest that these patterns are
continuing.
In contrast to M2, M3 has accelerated in recent months, advancing at an
9 percent annual rate in July, about 1 percentage point faster than in the second
quarter. July's pickup was driven by the interest-sensitive institutional money
fund component and likely arose from a transitory narrowing of the spread
between yields available on direct holdings of money market instruments and
yields on the money funds themselves, which occurred early in July. Large time
deposits continued to expand rapidly in June and July.
Adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules, growth of bank credit remained
robust, expanding at an 8 percent annual rate in July, following a 9 percent rate
in June.6 Nonetheless, the recent pace of growth is down significantly from that
in the second quarter, when the unsettled conditions in the high-yield bond
market in April and May forced many firms to turn to banks in order to obtain
funds.
Major loan categories registered moderate gains in July, and generally slowed
from the brisk pace set earlier in the year. Supported by continued strength in
capital equipment spending, business loans advanced at a 7 percent annual rate.
Real estate lending appears to have cooled slightly in July, as both home equity
and other residential loans expanded less rapidly than in the first and second
quarters. Consumer loans adjusted for securitization also weakened in July
relative to the first half of the year.
5. The retail money fund and liquid deposit components of M2 (but not overall M2) have
been affected by Merrill Lynch's decision, effective June 5, to restructure its Cash Management
Accounts, and the discussion above abstracts from these effects. The restructuring shifts
customers' funds from retail money funds into FDIC-insured money market deposit accounts
(which are included in liquid deposits) at two of Merrill Lynch's affiliated depository
institutions. Through the end of July, roughly $13-1/2 billion had been transferred. The new
arrangement allows each customer a maximum of $200,000 of deposit insurance--$100,000 at
each depository institution--and reportedly has provided the two depository institutions with a
relatively inexpensive and stable source of funds.
6. Expansion at the two Merrill Lynch-affiliated depository institutions accounted for as
much as 3/4 percentage point of the growth in total bank credit in each month.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The August 2000 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. Supplementary questions addressed banks'
policies regarding business loans that are secured by collateral and their activities in the
market for syndicated loans. Loan officers from fifty-six large domestic banks and
twenty-one U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey.
The results of the August survey indicate continued firming of business lending
practices by a significant fraction of both domestic and foreign banks. Compared to the
May survey, a larger fraction of domestic respondents reported tightening standards on
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans. As in May, more than half of domestic banks
and branches and agencies of foreign banks increased the premiums charged on riskier
loans from three months earlier. The fraction of domestic banks that reported
tightening lending standards in the market for commercial real estate loans also rose
relative to the previous survey.
Banks, on net, reported moderately weaker demand for C&I loans in August relative to
three months ago. A large fraction of foreign respondents noted a decrease in demand
for commercial real estate loans, while only a few domestic respondents, on net,
reported weaker demand for this type of loan.
Responses indicate that domestic banks typically require significant collateral for C&I
loans, especially when lending to small firms. In particular, a significant majority of
domestic banks reported that more than three quarters of their small business loan
outstandings are secured by collateral. Compared to domestic banks, however, foreign
branches and agencies generally reported lower levels of collateralization in their
business loan portfolio.
The survey also indicated that syndicated loans tend to be concentrated at the largest
domestic banks and at foreign branches and agencies. Most banks that participate in
this market noted that highly leveraged syndicated loans accounted for a relatively
small share of their total loan portfolio. Moreover, most banks said that the
delinquency rate on their syndicated loan portfolio was comparable to the delinquency
rate on their traditional C&I loans.
Standards and terms on both residential mortgage loans and other loans to households
were essentially unchanged in August relative to three months ago. Demand for
residential mortgage loans weakened, on net, for the fifth consecutive quarter. On net,
domestic banks also reported weaker demand for consumer loans over the past three
months.

III-A-2
Lending to Businesses
About 34 percent of domestic banks reported that they had tightened standards
somewhat over the past three months on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms,
and 24 percent tightened standards on loans to small firms over the same period. The
percentage of domestic banks that tightened standards on business loans increased 9
percentage points in August relative to the May survey, and for the second consecutive
quarter, the tightening of standards was particularly notable at the largest banks. On
net, almost a quarter of branches and agencies of foreign banks tightened standards on
C&I loans.
Significant fractions of both domestic and foreign banks also reported tightening terms
on C&I loans. Most strikingly, more than half of the domestic respondents indicated
that they had increased premiums charged on riskier loans to large and middle-market
firms. Moreover, about a third of domestic banks noted charging higher spreads over
their bank's cost of funds and increasing the costs associated with credit lines. The
same fraction of domestic banks increased premiums charged on riskier loans to small
firms. Among branches and agencies, 57 percent increased the premiums charged on
riskier loans, 43 percent increased the costs associated with credit lines, and 33 percent
charged higher spreads over their bank's cost of funds.
A sizable majority of both domestic and foreign respondents pointed to a less favorable
or more uncertain economic outlook as an important reason for tightening standards and
terms on C&I loans. In addition, more than half of foreign banks noted a worsening of
industry-specific problems, while a fair number of domestic banks cited a reduced
tolerance for risk as well as a worsening of industry-specific problems as reasons for
firming lending conditions in the business sector. Some of the largest domestic banks
and foreign branches and agencies also identified an increase in defaults by below-
investment-grade borrowers in the public debt markets as a reason for tightening
standards and terms on C&I loans.
Over the past three months, about 25 percent of domestic banks reported weaker
demand for business loans from large and middle-market firms, while 20 percent saw
stronger demand. Demand from small firms was similarly mixed, leaving overall
demand for C&I loans at domestic banks somewhat weaker, on net, over the period.
Relative to the last survey, in which almost half of the foreign branches and agencies
saw weaker demand, only 9 percent, on net, reported somewhat weaker demand for
C&I loans over the past three months.
An increase (decrease) in customers' needs for merger and acquisition financing was
most often identified as the reason for increased (decreased) demand for C&I loans at
both domestic and foreign banks over the past three months. Domestic banks that
experienced an increase in business loan demand also cited a shift in customer
borrowing from other less attractive sources. On the other hand, domestic banks that
reported a decrease in demand pointed to reduced capital expenditures by their
customers.
The fraction of domestic respondents that indicated that they had tightened standards on
commercial real estate loans over the past three months increased to 32 percent in

III-A-3
August, up from 22 percent in the May survey. In contrast, most branches and agencies
of foreign banks reported no change in standards on commercial real estate loans. On
net, a small fraction of domestic banks noted moderately weaker demand for
commercial real estate loans in the August survey; however, 36 percent of foreign
respondents reported weaker demand over the past three months.
C&I Loans Secured by Collateral
The survey included two special questions about C&I loans secured by collateral.
More than 70 percent of domestic banks indicated that the majority of the dollar
volume of outstanding C&I loans to large and middle-market firms is collateralized.
Almost all banks reported that at least half of their business loan outstandings to small
firms were collateralized, and nearly 80 percent of banks reported that more than three-
quarters of their small business loans were secured by collateral. In contrast, half of the
foreign banks said that less than a quarter of their outstanding dollar volume of business
loans was collateralized.
At domestic banks, the vast majority of collateralized loans to both small and large
firms are secured by accounts receivable, inventories, and capital equipment. At
branches and agencies of foreign banks, equity of a subsidiary of the company
receiving the loan is the most common form of collateral, followed by accounts
receivable and inventories.
Lending to Households
Over the past three months, 51 out of 53 domestic banks reported no change in
standards on residential mortgage loans. On net, 40 percent of respondents reported
somewhat weaker demand for mortgages to purchase homes relative to three months
ago. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter that banks have reported weaker demand
for home mortgages.
Banks indicated almost no change in their willingness to make consumer installment
loans over the past three months. Standards and terms on all types of consumer lending
were also largely unchanged in August relative to three months ago. However, for the
first time since 1996, the survey indicates that domestic banks, on net, have stopped
tightening standards on applications for credit card loans. On net, about 10 percent of
domestic respondents reported somewhat weaker demand for consumer loans over the
same period.
Syndicated Loans
In recent years, the market for syndicated loans has increased substantially. The
August survey included three special questions about banks' activities in the market for
syndicated loans. About 40 percent of the largest domestic banks reported that
syndicated loans made up less than 20 percent of their outstanding C&I loan volume.
However, about a quarter of the largest domestic banks and more than three-quarters of
foreign branches and agencies reported that syndicated loans accounted for at least half
of their business loan portfolio. The survey responses indicate that the smaller
domestic banks on the panel engage in relatively little syndicated lending.

III-A-4
Between 55 and 60 percent of both large domestic and foreign banks reported that no
more than 15 percent of the syndicated loans on their books are considered highly
leveraged (made to below-investment-grade borrowers at more than 250 basis points
over LIBOR). Only one large domestic bank and two foreign banks noted that highly
leveraged syndicated loans account for more than half of their syndicated loan
portfolio. Consistent with the relatively small share of highly leveraged syndicated
loans on their books, banks indicated, on net, that the delinquency rate on outstanding
syndicated loans is comparable to the delinquency rate on other C&I loans.

The value of exports of goods and services for April-May on average was
1.4 percent higher than in the first quarter. Almost all of the increase was in
capital goods-especially high-tech products (computers, semiconductors, and
telecommunications equipment)-and aircraft. Exports of high-tech products
rose at about the same strong pace as recorded in the first quarter, and exports of
aircraft rebounded from strike-depressed first quarter levels. Exports of other
machinery grew moderately, held down by an unusual drop in shipments in May.
Automotive products shipped to Canada (primarily parts used in vehicles sent to
the United States) turned down in April-May as U.S. vehicle sales eased back
from the torrid pace recorded earlier in the year. By region, most of the increase
in goods exports in April-May was in shipments to developing countries,
particularly Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, and China.
The value of imports of goods and services for April-May on average was
2.8 percent above the first-quarter level, with increases recorded in most major
trade categories. The largest increases were in capital goods, consumer goods,
and service payments (largely expenditures on travel). Automotive imports fell

(particularly those from Canada), reflecting the recent easing of U.S. vehicle
sales. The value of imported oil rose only moderately in April-May as an
increase in quantity was nearly offset by a decline in prices.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods.
Oil. In July, the price of imported oil (BLS) declined somewhat, following two
months of increases. Oil prices generally eased during July following Saudi
Arabia's announcement that it would increase oil production beyond its OPEC
production target-despite objections from other OPEC producers. In early
August, however, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude moved
higher amid concerns of falling crude oil inventories in the United States, supply
disruptions in Colombia, and heightened uncertainty over Saudi production
levels. Spot WTI is currently trading around $32 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods increased moderately in July,
led by rising prices for industrial supplies (primarily natural gas and unfinished
metals), with smaller increases in prices of imported automotive products and
consumer goods. Prices of computers and semiconductors declined. The price
index for other imported capital goods was up slightly from June but was below
the average for the second quarter. The increase in prices of imported consumer
goods in July followed declines in the previous two months. Overall, prices of
imported core goods (which exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) rose
0.4 percent in July, the largest monthly increase since February.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports were unchanged in July as declines in
prices of agricultural products was offset by moderate increases in prices of a
wide range of other exported goods, particularly industrial supplies and
automotive products. The prices of exported computers rose slightly following
declines in the previous month, and prices of semiconductors declined for the
third consecutive month. The price index for other exported capital goods rose
0.1 percent in July, the same rate as recorded every month this year. Overall,
prices of exported core goods (which exclude computers, semiconductors, and
agricultural products) rose 0.3 percent in July, a rate that is in line with average
increases recorded in the past three quarters.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased almost $7 billion in
the second quarter (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions
table). Reserve inflows from Japan-associated with April foreign exchange
intervention-resulted in the largest net inflow ($12 billion). Russia also
increased its official holdings significantly in the quarter ($4.5 billion), as the
country's massive current account surplus supported rapid reserve accumulation.
Large decreases were recorded for Brazil, Switzerland, and Taiwan. Foreign
officials favored agency bonds over Treasury debt in the quarter, as $10 billion

IV-6
in official purchases of agencies more than offset $4 billion in official sales of
Treasuries. Net sales of Treasuries would have been greater had it not been for
Japan's large purchases in conjunction with its foreign exchange intervention.
Partial data from the FRBNY indicate a slight decline in foreign official assets
for July.
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities slowed again in May, but resumed a
strong pace in June (line 4). In all, in the second quarter private foreigners
bought net $67 billion of U.S. securities, an amount far below the blistering pace
of the first quarter. Weighing down total net purchases were $21 billion in net
sales of Treasury securities, an amount that exceeds total net sales from last year.
The sales of Treasuries more than offset purchases of agency bonds, which
slowed markedly in June, reflecting a light issuing calendar. After a slowdown
earlier in the quarter, foreign net purchases of corporate bonds and stocks picked
up sharply in June. For the quarter, purchases of corporate bonds maintained the
recent quarterly pace of over $40 billion. Net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks
totaled $27 billion, down considerably from the extraordinary amount in the first
quarter, but in line with last year's record pace. Of the nearly $70 billion in net
purchases of U.S. corporate securities in the quarter, $62 billion was through
Europe.
The data on U.S. purchases of foreign securities are once again confounded by
stock swaps that result in acquisitions of foreign stocks by U.S. residents as
payments for foreign takeovers of U.S. firms. According to the transactions
data, U.S. investors sold $18 billion in foreign securities in the second quarter
(line 5). However, once approximately $29 billion in foreign stocks acquired net
through stock swaps is added to the transactions data, it is clear that U.S.
investors in fact acquired about $11 billion in foreign securities in the quarter.
Including the stock swaps, U.S. investors acquired about $22 billion in foreign
stocks, most of which was through the United Kingdom. The recent trend of
selling German stocks continued; net sales totaled $4 billion in the quarter and
$7 billion over the past four months. U.S. investors sold $11 billion in foreign
bonds, mostly through the Caribbean, but also through Asia.
A large net inflow of $52 billion was recorded for the banking sector in the
second quarter (line 3). This net inflow was concentrated in May and is largely
attributable to an increase in bank flows into U.S. branches of foreign banks
from affiliated offices in the Caribbean. This large inflow is consistent with the
large increase in business lending in May by foreign banks in the United States.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Since the June FOMC meeting, the nominal exchange value of the dollar against
a group of major currencies has risen 2 percent. The dollar appreciated
3-3/4 percent on balance vis-a-vis the euro and 2 percent against the yen, and
was little changed against the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling. After
trading in a narrow range during the first half of the intermeeting period, the
dollar appreciated rapidly against the euro in late July and early August. This
change appeared to be brought on by heightened market perceptions that growth
in the United States, though possibly moderating slightly from its recent elevated
level, could remain well above that in most European countries. The
pronounced narrowing of yield differentials between dollar- and euro-
denominated instruments-40 basis points for three-month money and 23 basis
points for 10-year government bonds-occurred mainly during the last two weeks
of the intermeeting period and might have helped check further appreciation of
the dollar against the euro. The European Central Bank and the Bank of
England did not adjust their policy rates during the period.

The dollar's appreciation against the yen, which occurred early in the
intermeeting period, appeared to be influenced by an unwinding of market
expectations that the Bank of Japan would end its zero interest rate policy at its
mid-July meeting. In the event, the Bank of Japan explained that while the
overall economic situation was indeed improving in Japan, the Bank was
refraining from raising rates at that time in part because the bankruptcy of Sogo,

IV-9
a large Japanese department store chain, had temporarily heightened uncertainty
in asset markets. A part of the dollar's July appreciation against the yen was
unwound in early August after U.S. data releases showed accelerating
productivity and subsiding labor cost pressures. Also, speculation began to
mount that the Bank of Japan would tighten its monetary policy stance at the
August 11 meeting of the Policy Board. The Policy Board did raise its target for
the overnight interbank interest rate to 25 basis points at that meeting; domestic
financial markets in Japan and the yen/dollar exchange rate showed little
immediate reaction. Yields on three-month instruments rose 20 basis points, on
balance, during the intermeeting period, yields on long-term yen debt obligations
changed little, and the Topix index of Japanese share prices declined 5 percent.

The dollar's exchange value against a group of currencies of other important
U.S. trading partners declined almost 2 percent during the intermeeting period.
This drop owed mainly to a 9 percent depreciation against the Mexican peso in
late June and early July, which followed Mexican presidential elections that
were peaceful and produced a clear victor, Vicente Fox of the opposition PAN
party. Fluctuations in the dollar's exchange rate against the currencies of other
Latin American countries and of developing Asian countries were generally
limited. The yield spread of the EMBI+ index over U.S. Treasuries fell from
717 basis points to around 660 basis points, its lowest level since before the

IV-10
Russian crisis of August 1998. Some of the decline was due to a successful
exchange by Brazil of a portion of its high-yield Brady debt for a newly issued,
lower-yield global bond.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the June Greenbook suggest that economic activity in the
foreign industrial countries was strong in the second quarter, but the limited
forward-looking indicators now available suggest some moderation in the pace
of growth in the current quarter. On balance, incoming data for Japan have been
positive, although some concerns have been raised about the durability of the
Japanese recovery. In the United Kingdom, recent indicators suggest that
although growth picked up in the second quarter, it is likely to slow somewhat in
the near term, and incoming data for Canada suggest that growth has moderated
from its recent rapid pace. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area
appears to be expanding robustly.
Headline consumer price inflation moved higher in June in the euro area and in
Canada, reflecting the recent surge in oil prices. However, core consumer price
data show little evidence of inflationary pressures in most of the foreign
industrial countries. In the euro area, the twelve-month rate of headline inflation
jumped to 2.4 percent, well above the 2 percent target ceiling, while core
inflation edged up to 1.3 percent. Headline Canadian inflation was 2.9 percent,
near the top of its target band, but core inflation was only 1.4 percent. U.K.
consumer price inflation remains below its target rate, and in Japan twelve-
month consumer price inflation remains negative.
In Japan, recent economic indicators have generally been positive, although last
month's bankruptcy of large-scale retailer Sogo has raised concerns about the
durability of the fledgling recovery. Industrial production continued to rise in
the second quarter, with an especially sharp gain in June, bringing the index to
its highest level since late 1997. Continued strong growth in demand for
equipment appears to have contributed to another solid gain in business
investment. Consumer spending may finally be improving; in the second
quarter, household expenditure posted its first quarterly gain since early last
year. However, both nonresidential and residential construction dropped back in
the second quarter after increasing earlier in the year.
The unemployment rate edged back up to 4.7 percent in June, a little below the
peak level of 4.9 percent reached earlier this year, although the job-offers-to-
applicants ratio continued to rise. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 0.7 percent in July
from a year earlier. The wholesale price index for domestic goods was up
0.3 percent year-over-year in July, but this increase largely reflects higher energy
pnces. The Japan Real Estate Institute's urban land price index was down
3 percent at the end of March compared with six months earlier and was
33 percent below its September 1991 peak.

IV-12
The latest Tankan survey showed another increase in business confidence in
July, led by large manufacturers, who are benefitting from increased IT
investment and strong foreign demand. However, the level of the aggregate
diffusion index for business sentiment among firms of all sizes and across all
industries remains low, at -18 in June versus -23 in March. Firms in all
categories reported that they expect conditions to continue improving over the
next three months. Survey expectations of profits, sales, and capital spending in
FY2000 are optimistic. Profits are expected to increase 13 percent, following an
estimated 24 percent increase in FY1999. Sales are expected to increase
2.4 percent this year, reversing a decline in FY1999 of about the same
magnitude. Capital expenditures across all firms are projected to be flat in
FY2000, after falling 9 percent in FY1999, but it is typical for capital spending
projections to be revised up over the year as plans become firmer.

Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first six months of 2000 was
$116 billion (s.a.a.r.), up from $109 billion in the same period last year.
Denominated in dollars, exports were up 21 percent from year-ago levels, largely

IV-13
because of a continuing surge in exports to developing Asian economies.
Imports were up 26 percent, partly reflecting a jump in the value of oil imports.
Citing signs of recovery and a reduction in downward price pressures, the Bank
of Japan decided on August 11 to lift the zero interest rate policy, raising its
target for the overnight call rate to 25 basis points. The decision was
characterized as a small adjustment to the degree of monetary easing in line with
the improvement of the economy.
Incoming data for the euro area suggest that economic activity grew robustly in
the second quarter. For April and May on average, the volume of euro-area
retail sales rose 1.2 percent above the first-quarter average, and euro-area
industrial production increased 1.9 percent from the first quarter. Although
German and Italian industrial production declined in June, output for the second
quarter as a whole registered strong gains in both countries. Limited available
forward-looking indicators suggest on balance that the pace of activity remains
strong in the current quarter. The volume of German industrial orders rose
5.5 percent in the second quarter, reflecting strength in both domestic and
foreign orders. Euro-area economic sentiment remained at high levels through
July. However, surveys of euro-area purchasing managers suggest that
manufacturing activity eased a bit in July.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged down to 9.1 percent
in June, its lowest rate since July 1992. (In constructing the harmonized
unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes national statistics to International
Labor Organization definitions.) In France, Germany, and Italy, unemployment
rates remain above the euro-area average, although they have declined noticeably
over the past year. In July, the German unemployment rate edged down to
9.5 percent, after remaining flat at 9.6 percent for three months.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in the twelve months to June, well
above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling, but the increase
primarily reflected higher energy prices. Excluding energy prices, the twelve-
month inflation rate edged up to 1.3 percent. July consumer price data show that
twelve-month headline inflation remained high in Germany and Italy relative to
last year, and increased in France.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP rose a preliminary 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r) in the
second quarter of 2000. Despite this apparent rebound from a modest pace of
growth in the first quarter, more forward-looking indicators suggest that growth
is slowing toward a rate near trend. Although business confidence picked up
somewhat in July, it remains considerably below levels recorded earlier this
year. In July, the outlook for new orders fell further, primarily reflecting a
weaker outlook for export orders. Consumer confidence has also fallen since
early this year.
The official claims-based unemployment rate fell to a 25-year low of 3.7 percent
in July, and the labor force survey measure of the unemployment rate fell to
5.5 percent for the three months centered in May, a record low. However,
twelve-month growth in average earnings has moderated in recent months, to
3.8 percent in June. This rate is now below the 4.5 percent rate that the Bank of
England has suggested is compatible with its inflation target.
Producer input prices have risen sharply in recent months, in part reflecting
higher oil prices. The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest rates) remains below the 2 1/2 percent target, in large part
reflecting the continued strength of sterling relative to the euro.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left the repo rate
unchanged at 6.0 percent for the sixth month in a row in August. In its August
Inflation Report, the MPC released its latest GDP and inflation forecasts. Under

IV-16
the assumption that official interest rates remain unchanged at 6 percent, GDP
growth is expected to slow to around 2-1/2 percent, near trend, for the remainder
of this year and 2001, then rise towards 2-3/4 percent in early 2002. Inflation is
projected to rise gradually from its current rate below the 2-1/2 percent target to
just above target by the end of the forecast.

In Canada, indicators suggest that growth slowed somewhat in the second
quarter from the strong gains of the previous two quarters. Real GDP in April
and May, on average, was up 0.7 percent from the first quarter, after rising
1.1 percent in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. Consumer
spending appears to have plateaued in the second quarter, as retail activity for
the April-May period was scarcely above that of the first quarter. However,
surveys of consumer confidence rebounded in the second quarter, and some of
the sluggishness in spending was attributed to temporary factors such as
abnormally cool spring weather.
Labor market indicators are also consistent with slowing growth. Employment
fell by 0.1 percent in both June and July, the first monthly declines since January
1998. As a result, the July unemployment rate rose to 6.8 percent, the first

IV-17
monthly increase in nearly a year. Employment growth since March has
averaged only 4,000 jobs per month, down from average monthly growth of
44,000 in the preceding six months.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation jumped to 2.9 percent in June
from 2.4 percent in May, largely on account of higher oil prices. However, the
twelve-month rate of core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was
only 1.4 percent in June, well within the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent
target range. Wage inflation, measured by average hourly earnings, has
moderated in recent months, helping to keep core price inflation steady.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic conditions in the major developing countries remained generally
favorable. In Mexico, growth in the second quarter slowed only a touch from
the previous quarter's sizzling pace, and recent growth in Korea-although down
somewhat from the double-digit rate recorded last year-has remained strong. In
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, data have indicated some payback in the second
quarter for booming first-quarter growth, but the most recent monthly data
suggest somewhat stronger growth going forward. Output growth in most
ASEAN countries has also been strong. The leading exception to this favorable
picture was Argentina, where unemployment rose and industrial production
recorded a sizable decline in the second quarter.
Inflationary pressures in the developing countries were generally well contained.
Inflation edged up in several countries, including Korea, in recent months, but
Mexican inflation registered further declines (notwithstanding the buoyant pace
of activity). Argentina and Hong Kong continued to experience deflation, while
China's deflationary episode now appears to be over.
In Mexico, recent economic growth nearly matched the very rapid pace
registered in the first quarter. GDP rose 8.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter, following a 11.3 percent jump in the previous quarter. Export growth
has remained robust, driven largely by a booming U.S. economy, but imports
have accelerated, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit in the second
quarter. Notwithstanding the strong growth in demand, consumer price inflation
continued to trend down.
In early July, opposition candidate Vicente Fox of the right-of-center National
Action Party (PAN) achieved a landmark victory in the Mexican presidential
election, ending the 71-year reign of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
The result was unexpectedly definitive and PRI officials quickly conceded
defeat. The post-election situation has been orderly so far, although there are
some indications of emerging dissension within the PRI. In the congressional
elections, the PAN gained a large number of seats but did not win a majority in
either house, raising the possibility of political wrangling during the transition in
early December and the upcoming negotiations over the 2001 budget.
Mexican financial markets reacted favorably to the election results, with short-
term interest rates dropping over 300 basis points in the immediate aftermath of
the election. However, since late July this decline has reversed, as the Bank of
Mexico has tightened monetary policy, arguing that the strength of the economy
threatens to undermine its goals of holding inflation under 10 percent this year
and below 8 percent next year. This is the fourth time this year that the Bank has
moved to tighten monetary conditions.

In July, the Mexican Finance Ministry unveiled a "financial strengthening"
program for 2000-01. An important component of this program was the renewal
and extension of credit lines with official and multilateral financial institutions
amounting to $19.7 billion. In addition, the North American Framework
Agreement, with its associated credit lines, was extended until December 2001.
Among the arrangements mentioned in the package was the Federal Reserve's
$3 billion swap line with the Bank of Mexico, which in May the FOMC had
extended until December 2001. Other elements of the program included efforts
to reduce public external debt and debt-servicing costs over the next three years
and the decision to treat the current stand-by arrangement with the IMF as only a
"precautionary arrangement."
In Brazil, data released since the June Greenbook indicate a slowing in the pace
of growth, particularly in the industrial sector. Real GDP growth fell below
1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter from 5 percent in the first quarter.
Monthly consumer price inflation rose to 1.6 percent in July from very low rates
in recent months, pushed up, in part, by drought and rising fuel prices. External
performance has continued to be disappointing, with small trade deficits since
March, after surpluses earlier this year. Export growth has been rapid-exports
were up 20 percent in July relative to July 1999-but this expansion has been
more than offset by import growth.

IV-23
In mid-July, the Brazilian central bank reduced its overnight interest rate
100 basis points in two steps to 16.5 percent. These moves were motivated by
prior signs of falling inflation and slowing output growth in recent months. In
mid-August, the Brazilian government issued over $5 billion in 40-year global
bonds (callable in 15 years) that were exchanged for a similar amount of Brady
bonds. With this swap, Brazil retired about one-sixth of its Brady debt.

The Brazilian government continues to record sizable primary (non-interest)
surpluses, achieving a primary surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP over the January-
May period. This result is well above the fiscal target in Brazil's IMF program.
In early August, the Brazilian government announced that it would lower its
target for the primary surplus in 2001 by 1/2 percentage point to 3 percent of
GDP, and set a primary surplus target of 2.7 percent of GDP for 2002.
In Argentina, data continue to point to an anemic recovery at best. GDP grew
2-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.), on average, during the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first
quarter of 2000, but indicators for the second quarter looked weak. Industrial
production fell almost 5 percent, consumer prices dropped more than 1 percent
below their year-earlier level, and the unemployment rate for May jumped to
14.5 percent. One hopeful sign has been the trade balance, which was positive
in the second quarter, as export growth remained strong. The scant information
for the third quarter has not been favorable-tax receipts were lackluster in July
and there was little change in the rate of deflation. Financial market conditions

IV-24
have been unsettled, reflecting investor concerns over the slow recovery. Brady
and EMBI+ spreads have edged up slightly since the last Greenbook, domestic
short-term rates have edged down, and the stock market is basically unchanged.

Recent data hint that recovery in Venezuela is taking hold. The government
reported a 10 percent increase in manufacturing output over the year ending in
May, and retail sales for May also grew notably from a year earlier. Inflation
continues to fall. Going forward, however, inflationary pressures may be
mounting as government spending is now soaring and the Central Bank is
keeping interest rates relatively low. On the political front, elections for
president and most national offices were held at the end of July. President
Chavez won reelection with 60 percent of the vote, ensuring him another six
years in office. Chavez's political control was enhanced further as his
supporters won a majority of the seats in Congress. Spreads on external debt
obligations have fallen somewhat since the elections, but uncertainty about
Chavez's economic policies continues to unsettle investors. Despite the inflow
of oil revenues, foreign currency reserves have risen only slightly this year,
indicating sizable capital flight.

In Korea, recent data suggest continued growth, but at a rate below the torrid
pace of last year. Industrial production recorded its second consecutive strong
increase in June, but this gain followed three months of declines. For the second
quarter as a whole, industrial production increased only 1 percent. The
unemployment rate edged down again in June. The inflation rate moved up
further, to nearly 3 percent in July. Bank of Korea Governor Chon has indicated
that preventing a build-up in inflation will be the Bank's top priority for the
remainder of this year.
Earlier this month, President Kim Dae-jung announced a major reshuffling of his
cabinet that involved replacing the finance and budget ministers and the head of
the Financial Supervisory Commission. The president indicated that he wants to
use the second half of his term to intensify the push for economic restructuring
and financial reform. The cabinet changes appear consistent with this pledge,
especially as the new appointments are technocrats rather than politicians.

Economic conditions remain favorable across the ASEAN region. Second-
quarter GDP rose over 10 percent (s.a.a.r.) in both Indonesia and Singapore, and
Malaysia registered a healthy increase in second-quarter industrial production.
Available data also show some signs of a pickup in the Philippines, following
weak performance in the first quarter. Although strong exports remain the
engine behind much of the growth in the region, consumption indicators point to
continued recovery in domestic demand. Likewise, second quarter trade
surpluses declined in much of the region, as growth in imports began to outpace
growth in exports.
Indonesia saw a jump in inflation during the June-July period, as the rupiah
weakened, but prices increased much more moderately in the rest of the ASEAN
region.
The economic outlook in Thailand appears somewhat weaker than in the rest of
the region. Recent industrial production, export, and import figures all have
registered slight declines, and consumer confidence indices have also fallen in
recent months. At the same time, political risks have heightened as
parliamentary elections approach.
In contrast, the political outlook in Indonesia has improved, as fears that the
president might be removed at the annual meeting of the People's Consultative
Assembly (August 7-18) have subsided. In response to criticisms regarding the
lack of leadership among the current economic policy team, President Wahid

IV-27
announced a series of changes. He has accepted the resignation of the current
economics minister; he plans to hand over some of the day-to-day operations of
the government to his vice president; and he intends to reshuffle the cabinet.
The government also signed a new letter of intent with the IMF, paving the way
for the release of the third $400 million disbursement under its three-year,
$5 billion program.

In China, real GDP rose 1.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, far slower
than the near double-digit pace of the first quarter, but in line with staff
expectations. This decline in growth largely appears to reflect temporary
factors, including distortions caused by statistical inadequacies in accounting for
the leap year and unusually long holiday celebrations. The waning effect of the
fiscal package introduced late last year, as well as flat exports following the
remarkable surge in the first quarter, also contributed to the more modest pace of
expansion. Retail sales figures, however, suggest that consumer demand
continued to recover, especially in urban areas. Consumer prices continued to
edge up on a twelve-month basis, in part due to higher oil prices. The monthly
trade surplus narrowed slightly in June and July, as imports rose and exports
were roughly flat.

In July, China's minister of finance confirmed that the government will boost
public spending in the second half of this year to shore up domestic demand.
The bulk of the extra spending has been earmarked for public investment
projects, especially in the underdeveloped western provinces, and technological
upgrades for state enterprises. Also in July, Central Bank Governor Dai
announced a three-year plan for liberalizing interest rates. Beginning later this
year, controls on foreign-exchange lending and deposit rates will be phased out,
followed by the easing of controls on local currency lending rates. Lastly, local-
currency deposit rates will become market-determined.
In Hong Kong, recent data suggested that economic growth in the second
quarter slowed from the extraordinarily strong rate in the first quarter. Retail
sales volume fell slightly (s.a.) in both April and May, depressed in part by
higher interest rates and negative wealth effects associated with weakness in
Hong Kong's stock market. Exports declined about 1 percent (s.a.) in the
second quarter, largely reflecting reduced trade flows with mainland China.
Nonetheless, strong employment gains pushed the unemployment rate down to
5 percent (s.a.) in the May-July period from 5.5 percent earlier in the year. The
property market remained weak, with real estate prices and the number of
transactions continuing to decline, despite the government's recent
announcement that it would reduce the supply of subsidized apartments for sale.
With falling property prices continuing to weigh on the rents and housing
component of the CPI, the index edged down further in May and June on a
seasonally adjusted basis.

In Taiwan, real GDP rose 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, far below
the rapid first-quarter pace. The slower rate of growth in the second quarter was

IV-30
widely expected, given the sharp drop in industrial output in April, following
several months of rapid expansion. In June, however, industrial output
rebounded strongly, rising a seasonally adjusted 3.4 percent. Robust demand,
especially from the United States, for electronics and information technology
products in June and July boosted exports to record levels, although rapidly
rising imports caused the trade surplus to narrow sharply. Despite higher oil
prices, the 12-month rate of inflation remained very low, partly reflecting a steep
fall in food prices. In late June, Taiwan's central bank raised its rediscount rate
to 4.75 percent from 4.625 percent, the second such increase in recent months.
In announcing the rise, the central bank noted widening spreads between interest
rates in Taiwan and those in the United States and Europe, and indicated that the
decision was taken to "prevent inflation from happening and maintain financial
stability."
