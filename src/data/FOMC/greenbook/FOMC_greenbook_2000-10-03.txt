Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Overall, economic activity appears to be expanding more moderately in the third
quarter than during the first half of the year. Employment has been advancing at
a slower pace, and hours worked have been nearly flat since the spring.
Consumer spending and housing demand have firmed a bit of late, but the recent
pace of activity in these sectors still is well below the exceptional rates seen
earlier. Meanwhile, businesses have continued to invest briskly in equipment
and software. Tight supplies of labor and energy are boosting costs, and despite
spectacular productivity gains, core inflation has picked up from a year ago.
Labor Market Developments
Nonfarm payroll employment fell 105,000 in August, partly reflecting further
declines in the number of temporary Census workers and the now-resolved
strike of nearly 90,000 Verizon employees)1 Looking beyond these special
circumstances, strike-adjusted private payrolls rose only 102,000, much less
than the first-half pace of 186,000. Averaging the July and August data, a
deceleration relative to the first half of the year has been evident in most major
industries and is particularly pronounced in construction, manufacturing, and
services.2
In August, the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on
private nonfarm payrolls edged down for the second consecutive month, leaving
the level at 34.3 hours--a bit below its two-year-long plateau of about
34.5 hours. The shorter average workweek over the summer has combined with
slower employment growth to keep aggregate production-worker hours
essentially flat since the spring.
1. The Census Bureau cut nearly 160,000 temporary positions from the decennial Census
payrolls in August, and only about 40,000 temporary employees remain. (At its peak in May,
the Census employed about 620,000 temporary workers.) Although there is no way to know
precisely how private payrolls were affected by this year's Census hiring, individual-level data
from the Current Population Survey indicate that an unusually large number of workers moved
from private employment to federal employment between April and May, when the Census
added the bulk of its temporary employees. These data also show a reverse flow beginning in
June, when most of the temporary jobs ended. A rough guess is that the Census Bureau may
have "borrowed" as many as 25,000 workers per month from the private sector last spring and
paid back at about the same monthly pace over the summer. Thus, accounting for this small
Census effect slightly reinforces our general impression that the growth of private labor demand
has slowed.
2. As we have mentioned before, tight labor markets, heavy demand, and unusually mild
winter weather may have distorted the usual seasonal employment patterns in the construction
industry, accentuating its deceleration since the beginning of the year. In addition, shifts in the
timing of plant shutdowns have distorted the normal seasonal pattern of July and August changes
in manufacturing; thus, the two-month average loss of 14,000 per month probably gives a better
signal of the change in factory jobs than does either month's figure.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up in August to
4.1 percent; on balance, the rate has barely changed so far this year. The labor
force participation rate also rose slightly last month, but it remains well below
the elevated level registered in the first few months of the year.
Other indicators have provided somewhat mixed signals about labor market
activity. The four-week moving averages of both initial claims and insured
unemployment have moved up from last winter's extremely low levels,
consistent with some slowing in employment growth. In addition, consumer
perceptions of job prospects, as measured by both the Conference Board and
Michigan surveys, are a bit lower than they were during the summer, although
households remain upbeat about the labor market. From the vantage point of
employers, a smaller percentage of personnel executives responding to the
Bureau of National Affairs' survey reported difficulties filling technical and
production positions, but a larger percentage indicated that office and clerical
jobs have been hard to fill this quarter. Greater tightness in the labor market
also was evident in the National Federation of Independent Businesses' (NFIB)
measure of "positions hard to fill," which climbed to a record high in August.3
In addition, a sizable fraction of employers in the Manpower and NFIB surveys
expect that current hiring strength will persist into the near future.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the second quarter, and
we expect no revision to that figure.4 Over the four quarters ending in 2000:Q2,
nonfarm business productivity increased 5-1/4 percent. This marks the largest
four-quarter growth rate registered since 1983, a period when the economy was
recovering from a deep recession.
The BLS report also indicated that productivity in the nonfinancial corporate
sector rose at an annual rate of 5.0 percent in the second quarter of 2000.5 Over
the four quarters ending in 2000:Q2, output per hour in this sector was reported
to have increased 4.8 percent, about 1/2 percentage point more than the gain
over the four quarters ending in 1999:Q2.
Industrial Production
Gains in industrial output have slowed from rates posted earlier in the year.
After having risen at an annual rate of 7-1/4 percent in the first half of the year,
the August level of total industrial production was up only 3-1/2 percent at an
annual rate from the second-quarter average. On the strength of a sharp gain at
utilities in August, industrial production rose 0.3 percent that month, following a
downward-revised figure showing no gain in July.6 Overall, manufacturing
output increased only a touch in August; excluding motor vehicles and parts,
output in this sector edged down 0.1 percent after having risen at an average rate
of 0.6 percent for several months. With this weakness in production, the
utilization rate in manufacturing edged down to 81.2 percent, a shade below its
long-run average.
The rate of increase in output in the high-tech sector (computers,
semiconductors, and communications equipment) has dropped back from the
extraordinary pace seen earlier this year, although it is still quite rapid by
4. The quarterly pattern of changes in nonfarm business output and productivity from the
fourth quarter of 1999 to the second quarter of 2000 is distorted because the BEA attributed to
the fourth quarter of 1999 payments to defense contractors for goods and services that were
delivered in the first quarter of 2000. The staff estimates that this shift boosted the fourth-quarter
increases in output and productivity about 0.6 percentage point, held down first-quarter changes
about 1.2 percentage points, and raised second-quarter changes about 0.6 percentage point. The
change in productivity over the four quarters ended in 2000:Q2 is unaffected by this special
factor.
5. Measured productivity growth in the nonfinancial corporate sector--which is based on
income-side data from the national accounts--appears to have been unaffected by the defense
spending anomaly.
6. The downward revision to July IP growth of 0.4 percentage point was unusually large.
The average revision to the percent change in total IP, without regard to sign, from the first to the
fourth estimates was 0.2 percentage point during the 1987-97 period. Three industries accounted
for the bulk of the revisions in July: steel mill products, paper, and original equipment motor
vehicle parts. In each case, the physical product data for July that we received after the first
estimate was published pointed to lower growth than in the initial estimate.

historical standards. In the computer industry, production gains have come off
the elevated pace associated with the earlier lifting of Y2K-related lockdowns.
Meanwhile, output of communications equipment has continued to grow
rapidly. In addition to the growth in underlying demand for computers and
communications equipment, the production of semiconductors in the first half of
the year received an extra boost from the desire of major purchasers to increase
inventories in response to lengthening order lead times. With the rapid rise in
output, utilization rates in this industry moved above 100 percent. In the past
couple of months, the rate of production advance--although still quite rapid--has
slowed to a pace closer to that of capacity expansion.

In some areas outside of the high-tech sector, production has softened. First,
light vehicle sales have dropped back from their high first-quarter level, and--
with days' supply now higher than earlier in the year--production has been
reduced. Second, as housing starts have trended down this year, the production
of construction supplies also has decelerated. Third, higher imports have
squeezed producers of iron and steel, and, with a buildup of inventories at steel
service centers, production has been cut back sharply in the past couple of
months. Finally, higher energy prices have affected production in a number of
industries. In trucking, high fuel prices--along with an abundant supply of used

rigs--have reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks, and production has
moved down as well. At the same time, rising electricity costs in the Northwest
have curtailed operations at copper and aluminum processors. In contrast,
higher fuel prices have stimulated a sharp increase in oil and natural gas
extraction.
Near-term indicators are consistent with a continuation of a slower pace of
production than earlier in the year. The NAPM diffusion index for new orders
showed a net decline in July and August; other components of the purchasing
managers' survey have also weakened. Real adjusted new orders in the Census
M3 data, excluding high-tech equipment and electronic components, have
moved up only slightly, on net, in July and August.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light motor vehicles in August were at an annual rate of 17.4 million
units and have averaged 17.2 million units so far in the third quarter. This pace
is the same as in the second quarter, but down considerably from the blistering
rate of sales in the first quarter. In July and August, sales received a boost from
fleet deliveries (confidential). Retail sales in those months were noticeably
below the second-quarter pace, likely reflecting the same macroeconomic
factors--slower income and employment gains and a flattening of the stock
market--that have restrained other consumer spending.
Business demand for motor vehicles continues to be mixed. As indicated, fleet
sales of light vehicles jumped in July and August, with the increase largely
concentrated at GM. Despite an uptick in August, the level of net new orders
for heavy trucks remains well below that of last year; also, backlogs have fallen
every month since May 1999. For medium trucks, net new orders declined in
August, retracing some of the surge in July, and remain below the elevated
levels reached in mid-1999.
Total motor vehicle assemblies (including medium and heavy trucks) in August
came in at an annual rate of 12.8 million units, and September assemblies
appear headed for a similar rate. Production was held down in both months by
shutdowns at Ford to free up replacement tires for the Firestone recall; in
addition, GM and DaimlerChrysler made some inventory-related cutbacks.5 The
inventory problems are concentrated in the light-truck segment, where domestic
days' supply was 75 days in August--significantly above the desired level of 65
to 70 days; days' supply of autos was in a more comfortable range in August.
5. On August 28, Ford shut down production of three light truck plants; the company
restarted production on September 18. This shutdown held down production in August by
0.15 million units (annual rate) and by 0.3 million units in September. Ford has indicated that it
intends to make up about half of the lost production later this year, although the company has not
yet built that into its production plans.

For the third quarter as a whole, total production is scheduled at 12.7 million
units, down from the 13.4 million unit pace in the second quarter. Schedules for
the fourth quarter also point to a 12.7 million unit production rate, suggesting
that automakers do not expect sales to weaken dramatically in the near term.
Regarding medium and heavy trucks, domestic production dropped to an annual
rate of 390,000 units in August--the lowest rate posted so far this year. Both
Navistar and DaimlerChrysler's Freightliner unit recently announced layoffs and
further production cuts to deal with slower demand.
Consumer Spending and Income
The pace of real consumer spending appears to have picked up in July and
August, following a second-quarter increase in real PCE of just 2.9 percent at an
annual rate.6 That said, available data suggest that the third-quarter increase in
real consumption will be less than the pace over the past couple of years.
Nominal retail sales in the control category of stores rose 0.4 percent in August
after an upward-revised gain of 0.8 percent in July. In August, outlays at
durable goods stores rose briskly; spending also increased at outlets selling
apparel, food, general merchandise, and "other nondurable goods." In contrast,
nominal purchases at gasoline stations fell 1-1/4 percent in August, reflecting

both lower prices and, according to physical product data from the Department
of Energy, a decline in real gasoline purchases.7
Our most recent information on service expenditures is for July, when real PCE
for services rose 0.3 percent, just a bit below the 0.4 percent average monthly
increase over the first half of the year. In July, as in June, service outlays were
held down by declines in real spending on electricity. Brokerage services also
are estimated to have dropped in July, and declines in motor vehicle leasing and
purchases of airline tickets held down the transportation services category.
However, real spending rose across most of the other major categories of
services, led by a significant increase in recreational services--a component that
has been growing strongly throughout the year.
Although the fundamentals underlying consumption growth remain solid, the
trends in real income and household net worth are not so stimulative as during
the past couple of years. Real DPI increased 2-3/4 percent over the twelve
months ending in July (our most recent reading), a touch lower than the
3 percent gain over the preceding twelve-month period. Furthermore, on the
basis of the payroll employment data, we expect little change in the level of
private wage and salary income in August. Meanwhile, with little impetus from
the stock market, the ratio of net worth to disposable income slipped in the
second quarter, and we expect the third-quarter ratio to tick down a bit further.
If sustained, this would represent a significant break from the uptrend observed,
on average, from 1995 through the end of 1999.
Despite these recent developments--and rising prices for gasoline and fuel oil--
consumer confidence has remained favorable. The preliminary estimate of the
Michigan Survey Research Center index of consumer sentiment rose
1-1/2 points in September, and the Conference Board measure increased 1 point.
In both surveys, respondents gave more favorable assessments of current
conditions and were more optimistic about future conditions, as well.
Housing Markets
After having weakened sharply earlier in the year, housing demand appears to
have received a lift from the easing of rates on fixed-rate mortgages in the
spring and summer. Since mid-May, mortgage rates have reversed more than a
third of the increase that occurred between late 1998 and the spring of 2000.
Still, the stimulative effect of softening mortgage rates has been working against
a considerable drag on demand from the slower rise in income and employment
7. When estimating quarterly GDP, the BEA uses Department of Energy data on gallons of
gasoline delivered to retail outlets (gasoline stations and truck stops) to estimate real gasoline
purchases rather than deflating retail sales at gasoline stations.

and the recent decline in the wealth-to-income ratio; consequently, a return to
the pace of construction seen earlier in the year seems unlikely.
In August, single-family housing starts rose 4.6 percent to 1.26 million units at
an annual rate, returning starts to about the May level. However, even with this
pickup, the average pace of starts in July and August was still 5-1/4 percent
below that in the first half of this year. Meanwhile, the starts-to-permits ratio
was on the high side in August, pointing to a slightly lower pace of starts going
forward.
In addition to the pickup in starts, the most recent readings on home sales have
pointed to firmer demand. New home sales jumped more than 14 percent in
July, although the pace that month may have been inflated some by a glitch in
the Census Bureau's estimation procedures and probably should not be taken at
face value.8 Sales of existing homes bounced back more than 9 percent in
August, about offsetting a drop in July. On average, the level of existing home
sales in July and August was up 2 percent from the first half of this year.9
Some other indicators of conditions in housing markets also have been more
favorable in recent months, although they remain substantially below peaks
reached more than a year ago. After having declined steeply since late 1998, the
home buying conditions index from the Michigan survey rose in September for
the third consecutive month, and the proportion of respondents citing low
interest rates as a reason why it was a good time to buy a home has been rising.
Similarly, after having fallen considerably since mid-1999, builders' ratings of
new home sales have been essentially flat, on balance, over the past four
months.
In the multifamily sector, starts fell 16 percent in August to an annual rate of
270,000 units, well below the average level for last year and the first half of this
year. However, the starts-to-permits ratio was on the low side in August,
suggesting that starts are likely to strengthen some. In addition, underlying
conditions in the multifamily housing market are fairly favorable: In the second
quarter (latest available data), the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units
remained in the low range observed in recent years, and both apartment rents
and the value per square foot of multifamily rental properties continued to rise.
8. The Census staff makes an imputation for homes that are sold before a permit has been
issued, and they believe that processing errors caused the imputation to overestimate sales in
July. Nonetheless, even excluding imputed sales, their figures showed a large number of new
home sales in July, still suggesting relatively strong sales activity.
9. New home sales are recorded when the contracts are signed. Existing home sales are
mostly recorded when the sales are closed and therefore should tend to lag further behind
changing market conditions than would sales of new houses.

Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real business spending on equipment and
software--which rose at an annual rate of 19 percent over the first half of the
year--appears set for another large gain in the current quarter, again led by
sizable increases in outlays on high-tech equipment. However, the recent data
on orders point tentatively toward some moderation in the pace of spending
growth in the coming months.
Shipments of computing equipment increased 11 percent over the July-August
period (not at an annual rate), implying a continuation of the very hefty gains in
nominal spending that occurred in the first half of the year. Even though prices
have declined more slowly than in recent years, these recent gains are strong
enough to generate a continued rapid advance in real hardware outlays.
Similarly, strong demand for business software has led to persistent growth in
real investment even as its price has turned up this year. The strength in demand
for hardware and software reflects continuing efforts by businesses throughout
the economy to adopt a range of technologies that improve information flow and
supply-chain management.
Elsewhere in the high-tech sector, outlays on communications equipment appear
to have decelerated in the current quarter: Shipments and imports have both
increased more modestly in recent months than earlier in the year. Orders have
also declined from their previous very high levels. However, despite these signs
of slowing, the near-term outlook for spending on communications equipment
remains positive. In the near term a substantial backlog of unfilled orders
should provide support for shipments. And increasing demand for broadband
links and wireless communication, along with the effects of deregulation, should
be a source of continuing strength in equipment demand.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation categories, business spending on
equipment appears to be cooling off a little, following the substantial gains
recorded over the first half of the year. Shipments for this category fell
1.9 percent over the July-August period. Orders have continued to run ahead of
shipments in recent months, but these data are a somewhat misleading indicator
of the near-term outlook for shipments because of the high level of orders for
gas turbines, which have delivery lags of at least two years.10 Although still up
from the levels of late 1999, the backlog of orders in this category excluding
turbines has been about flat in recent months; with orders also flattening out,
this suggests some softness in shipments in the coming months.
10. The long delivery times imply that new orders for turbines do not boost shipments or
real equipment and software outlays in the near term. However, once firms begin to produce the
newly ordered turbines, work-in-process inventories increase, and real GDP rises accordingly.

Nonresidential structures. The rise in real investment in nonresidential
structures moderated to an annual rate of 4-3/4 percent in the second quarter,
down sharply from the 22 percent pace in the first quarter. In July, nominal
nonresidential construction put in place fell 0.8 percent, leaving the level of
spending about equal to the second-quarter average. However, property values
and rents rose somewhat in the second quarter and vacancy rates fell, suggesting
that, on the whole, the environment for nonresidential investment remains fairly
positive.
Office buildings remain one of the key areas of strength in nonresidential
construction, and the fundamentals in that market appear to support further
growth in outlays. According to the latest available data, vacancy rates for
office properties in both downtown and suburban locations declined further in
the second quarter. Moreover, after having trended down between early 1998
and the fall of 1999, the year-over-year change in office rent has picked back up
steadily, reaching 10 percent in the second quarter. And the year-over-year
increase in the value of office properties jumped to 6-1/2 percent in the second
quarter, retracing about one-third of the deceleration that began early last year.
Construction of other commercial structures, which include retail space and
warehouses, dropped back in the second quarter; however, the 3-1/4 percent
increase in expenditures over the past year was a bit above the pace of a year
earlier. The rates of increase in both property values and rents in the retail
sector picked up in the second quarter, extending the upturn that began in the
latter half of last year. Still, the gains are well below those recorded in early
1998. For warehouses, the year-over-year rate of increase in rents continued to
move up in the second quarter, and the rate of increase in property values held
steady after having picked up a bit from its low of late last year.
With vacancy rates having dropped through the second quarter and
manufacturing capacity utilization approaching long-run norms, real outlays for
industrial construction have rebounded some of late. These expenditures rose at
an annual rate of 21 percent in the second quarter and were up 6-3/4 percent
from the year-earlier level. Nonetheless, the level of construction is 11-1/2
percent below its recent peak in mid-1998.
Business Inventories
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor
vehicles increased at an annual rate of $61 billion in July, down from the
$72 billion pace recorded in the second quarter. With sales decelerating,
inventory-sales ratios--which had declined throughout 1999 and earlier this
year--have leveled out, on balance, in recent months. Still, only a few scattered
inventory imbalances are evident at the industry level.

Manufacturers' inventories increased at an annual rate of $50.6 billion in book-
value terms in July, up from the $25 billion second-quarter pace. More than half
of July's stockbuilding occurred in the durable goods sector, in which shipments
declined 1.6 percent. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, the overall
manufacturing inventory-shipments ratio has been essentially flat since the
beginning of the year, and the disaggregated data show only a couple of
industries--notably construction materials and textiles--in which overhangs in
stocks are apparent.
The book value of non-auto wholesale inventories increased at an annual rate of
$13.8 billion in July, down from the $33 billion pace recorded in the second
quarter. Despite the slowing pace of stockbuilding, the July inventory-sales
ratio for this category edged up to 1.27 months, as sales declined a touch.
Wholesale sales--which had grown rapidly throughout 1999--have decelerated
appreciably this year, and inventory-sales ratios have increased across a range of
wholesale categories. Stocks at steel service centers and at wholesalers of
lumber, construction materials, and hardware are currently on the high side.
Nonetheless, these ratios generally remain well below the elevated levels
reached in mid-1998.
Inventories of non-auto retailers fell at an annual rate of $3.1 billion in July after
an accumulation of $14-1/2 billion in the second quarter. The decline in retail
stocks in July may have reflected a positive sales surprise: Non-auto retail sales
increased 0.8 percent in July, somewhat faster than their recent trend, and the
inventory-sales ratio fell to 1.32 months, at the low end of the range recorded
this year. On balance, though, the retail inventory-sales ratio has also been
about flat over the past few months.
Government Expenditures
Federal government. The recent information on the federal budget remains
very favorable. The unified budget surplus reached $229 billion over the twelve
months ending in August, $125 billion more than the level of the preceding
twelve months.
Receipts have continued to rise sharply in recent months. The receipts total for
July and August, which consists mainly of payments for withheld income and
social insurance taxes, were 9-1/2 percent above the level of a year earlier.
Daily Treasury data point to sizable advances in nonwithheld taxes and
corporate tax payments in September.
Outlays, adjusted for paydate timing shifts and major financial transactions, rose
4 percent in July and August relative to a year earlier. Defense spending was a
little lower in nominal terms than during the summer of 1999 and considerably

below the average level in the second quarter of 2000. These data point to a
sharp decline in NIPA real defense purchases in the third quarter. In contrast,
agricultural spending rose sharply during the year ending in August, and another
large increase apparently occurred in September, as roughly $5 billion of
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) payments contained in the Agricultural
Risk Protection Act were distributed to farmers. These CCC payments are
reflected in farm income in the NIPA and thus will provide a significant boost to
September personal income.
The House has passed all thirteen of the fiscal 2001 appropriations bills.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, these bills would allow nominal
discretionary outlays to increase about 4 percent in fiscal 2001. The Senate has
passed nine appropriations bills; two of these have been signed by the President,
and we expect a continuing resolution to keep the government operating while
differences are hashed out. Given the current negotiating position of the
Administration, discretionary spending likely will rise more than in the House-
passed versions of the appropriations bills. When all is said and done, the likely
increase in appropriations would be consistent with a moderate gain in real
discretionary outlays next year. Little headway has been made on finding
agreement between the two branches on tax or mandatory spending legislation.
State and local governments. Indicators of state and local spending available
for the third quarter have been mixed, but appear consistent with a modest
increase in real outlays. Employment gains averaged 41,000 in July and
August, marking a substantial rebound from the outright decline registered in
the second quarter. Averaging through the monthly ups and downs, state and
local government employment has increased somewhat more slowly this year
than in the past two years.
Total real construction spending dropped 2-1/2 percent at a monthly rate in July,
continuing its retreat from the surge around the turn of the year. Unusually
warm and dry weather in the first quarter no doubt elevated construction
spending and then damped the typical seasonal step-up during the spring.
Nonetheless, the level of spending in July seems anomalously low, and some
bounceback seems likely.

Prices
Although the consumer price index edged down 0.1 percent in August, the
increase over the past twelve months was 3.4 percent, 1 percentage point more
than over the preceding twelve-month period." Excluding food and energy, the
CPI rose 0.2 percent in August and was up 2.5 percent over the past twelve
months. On a current-methods basis, the twelve-month change in the core CPI
has moved up 0.8 percentage point over the past year; excluding tobacco as well
as food and energy items, the acceleration over the past year is 0.9 percentage
point. Core PCE prices, available through July, have also accelerated over the
past year, though less so than the core CPI.
Energy prices remain an important element of the inflation story. Despite a
decline of 2.9 percent in August, the CPI for energy was up 13 percent over the
past twelve months, and the run-up in crude oil prices since early August points
to further increases in the coming months. Indeed, survey data for the first half
of September already indicate sizable increases in prices of both gasoline and
heating oil. Natural gas prices turned down in August--the first decline so far
this year--but spot prices point to another increase in September, and futures
markets suggest that natural gas prices will rise further in the coming months.
Consumer electricity prices were unchanged in August after having posted a
large increase in July that was concentrated in California, where deregulation
has combined with very strong demand to generate sharp price spikes.
Consumer food prices rose 0.2 percent in August after having moved up
0.5 percent in July. Over the past year, food prices have accelerated roughly in
line with the core CPI, with the twelve-month change moving up to about
2-3/4 percent in August from a pace of about 2 percent over the preceding
twelve-month period. Higher energy prices have boosted the costs of
processing, transporting, and preserving food products this past year. In
addition, the rate of decline in farm prices seems to have slowed; after having
fallen about 5 percent per year over the 1997-99 period, the index of prices
received by farmers from January to August of this year was only slightly below
the average for the same months of 1999. Futures prices are on about the same
track as in mid-August and continue to point to little change in overall farm
prices over the course of 2000.
11 The BLS announced on September 27 that it would revise this year's CPI data to correct
calculation errors in the indexes for owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent. The only
information released by the BLS today indicated that the increase in the total CPI from
December 1999 to August 2000 using the corrected data is 2.7 percent (not at an annual rate),
compared with an increase of 2.6 percent in the originally published data. The BLS plans to
release the revised indexes on September 28, and we will discuss the latest information in the
Greenbook Supplement.

Outside of the food and energy areas, acceleration in consumer prices is evident
both in commodities and services. Core commodity prices edged down in
August but are up 1/2 percent over the past twelve months, 1/4 percentage point
more than the increase over the preceding period. Excluding tobacco prices,
which had increased especially sharply over the earlier period, the acceleration
in core commodity prices over the past year is close to 3/4 percentage point.
Prices of new vehicles edged down in August and are up only 1/2 percent over
the past twelve months--although this represents an acceleration relative to the
outright declines seen over the previous year. Prices have also been rising more
rapidly for a range of other consumer goods. The CPI for non-energy services
increased 0.3 percent in August and was up 3.5 percent over the past year,
nearly 1 percentage point above its year-earlier increase. Shelter price increases
have moved up only a bit over the past year, but the rate of increase of prices of
medical services has picked up more noticeably, as have prices of a range of
other services.
As with consumer prices, capital goods prices have accelerated modestly. The
PPI for capital equipment was unchanged in August but has increased
1.1 percent over the past year--1 percentage point more than the increase over
the preceding twelve-month period. That acceleration is most pronounced in
aircraft and motor vehicles and also reflects a smaller rate of decline of
computer prices: The PPI for computers fell about 15 percent over the past
twelve months after having declined at about a 24 percent rate over the
preceding three years. The firming of computer prices this year is consistent
with evidence of very strong demand in the face of limited capacity in the short
run. This is especially true for semiconductors, where capacity utilization rates
have been exceeding 100 percent. In August, however, the PPI for computers
fell 2.2 percent, its largest decline since January; whether this presages a
renewal of larger price declines is an open question.
Price changes have been mixed at earlier stages of processing. The PPI for
intermediate materials excluding food and energy edged down 0.1 percent in
August--the first decline in this index since early 1999. The twelve-month
change in this series has edged off its highs and now stands at 2-1/2 percent.
Furthermore, the PPI for core crude prices moved down for a sixth month in
August; this series has declined about 6 percent (not at an annual rate) since
February after having risen more than 15 percent over the preceding twelve
months. However, prices of industrial commodities have increased since the
price quotes for the PPI were collected in mid-August. Prices of forest products
and some metals have moved up lately, and the Journal of Commerce industrial
price index has increased 4.7 percent over the past month.
Despite the fact that overall consumer price inflation has continued to pick up
this year, survey measures of inflation expectations have changed little on
balance. The median response to the University of Michigan survey of one-

year-ahead inflation expectations, which averaged 3 percent in the first half of
this year, stood at 2.9 percent in early September after having ticked down to
2.7 percent in August. These near-term inflation expectations had risen about
1/2 percentage point over 1999, but have not increased further this year despite
the larger CPI increases. Longer-term inflation expectations have also been
quite stable over the past year; the median five- to ten-year expectation of
inflation from the Michigan survey was 3.1 percent in early September, up about
1/4 percentage point from a year ago.
Information on labor costs this quarter is mostly limited to the BLS monthly
data on average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which
increased 0.3 percent in August after having risen 0.4 percent in July. Over the
past twelve months, average hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent, near the high
end of the relatively flat range seen over the past two years.
One important aspect of labor costs looking forward is the prospect for
substantial increases in employers' costs for health care premiums. The federal
government--the nation's largest health-care purchaser--announced that
increases in FEHB premiums will average 10-1/2 percent in 2001, up from a
pace of about 9 percent this year. CALPERS--the nation's second largest
purchaser--announced premium increases of about 11 percent next year.
Scattered survey data suggest that increases in the private sector may be of
similar magnitude, and a recent Kaiser survey found that firms have not been
able, to date, to shift cost increases on to their employees in this tight labor
market.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Market participants have read the news over the intermeeting period as further
confirmation that growth is slowing to or below the economy's potential, and
sentiment has begun to emerge that the next monetary policy action is at least as
likely to be an easing as a tightening. Yields on short-term and many
intermediate-term instruments fell with the change in the policy outlook, but
some yields at the longest maturities, twenty to thirty years, moved higher.
Increased uncertainty that accompanied the rise in oil prices may have reduced
the attractiveness of long-term debt in general. In addition, heavy corporate
issuance of long-term debt and, perhaps, growing skepticism about the size of
future budget surpluses helped to erode some of the earlier scarcity premiums at
the long end of the Treasury yield curve. Major equity indexes have declined
3-1/2 to 7 percent on bearish warnings about corporate earnings, and measures
of stock market uncertainty derived from options prices have increased in recent
weeks, especially for technology stocks.
Net borrowing by businesses and households appears to have ebbed from the
strong pace observed during the second quarter of the year but nonetheless has
remained robust. In the government sector, the Treasury has continued to pay
down its debt, and net borrowing by state and local governments stayed light.
Growth in M2, which had slowed in June and July, picked up strongly in August
and early September.
Interest Rates and Stock Prices
Movements in Treasury yields over the intermeeting period resulted in a notable
twisting of the yield curve, with shorter-term yields falling in concert with the
lower expected path for the federal funds rate and long-dated Treasury yields
rising. Market participants have pointed to uncertainty about high oil prices and
the course of the euro as factors prompting some investors to shift funds away
from relatively riskier positions in long-term debt and toward shorter-dated
instruments. Moreover, as the election approaches, investors have apparently
focused more on the possibility that the next President and Congress may
implement policies that would slow the paydown of federal debt. In addition to
influencing the outlook for national saving, such considerations seem to have
led to some unwinding of the "supply effects" that have depressed Treasury
yields since the beginning of this year.
Consistent with the notion that supply factors are partly responsible for
movements in long-dated Treasury yields, the rise in the thirty-year Treasury
yield since the August FOMC meeting has not been matched by rates on
comparable agency securities and swaps, which are about unchanged. The Baa
corporate bond yield, which pertains to bonds with an average maturity of
approximately twenty-two years, did move up but by less than the thirty-year
Treasury yield. As with the Treasury yield curve, private yield curves have

steepened a bit, suggesting that some of the same forces behind movements in
the Treasury curve-such as the uncertainty surrounding oil prices and the
euro-have also driven movements in private yield curves.
Third-quarter earnings reports are a few weeks away, but the number of profit
warnings has been atypically high of late, weighing on equity prices. Some
multinationals have announced that profits will be depressed because of
weakness in European currencies, and technology companies have cited slowing
sales. Rising oil prices have also caused firms to issue earnings warnings for
this quarter, and share prices in the basic materials sector, which relies heavily
on oil as an input, have been particularly hard hit. On net over the intermeeting
period, the Wilshire 5000 index is down 3-1/2 percent, and the Nasdaq has
fallen about 7 percent.
Business Finance
The cooling off in the equity market has also been evident in the pace of gross
public equity issuance. Seasoned offerings, which are largely carried out by
firms that have recently gone public, have remained depressed because share
prices of many young firms have weakened considerably since the spring.
Although the pace of IPO issuance has recovered-there were fifty-five IPOs in
August, the most since July 1999-investors apparently remain less enthusiastic
than they were in late 1999 and early this year, when the average first-day
returns far exceeded those posted of late. Going forward, IPO volume is
expected to continue at a moderate pace because the pipeline for companies
waiting to go public remains full.
Several large mergers among financial firms were announced during the
intermeeting period. In the nonfinancial sector, no similar-sized mergers were
announced or completed, but the list of pending deals suggests that equity
retirements through domestic mergers will continue at a brisk pace in the next
few quarters. Pending foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies also point to
sizable merger-related domestic equity retirements. Although few companies
have announced share buyback programs lately, actual share repurchases this
quarter are expected to be robust as "old economy" firms complete the buyback
programs that they announced in the first quarter of the year.
In the bond market, investment-grade offerings picked up in August, and data in
hand point to a further increase in volume in September. In addition, issuance
of speculative-grade bonds has recovered in September after two months of
weakness. Nonetheless, small-sized offerings continue to represent a
historically low share of total proceeds raised, suggesting that liquidity remains
a concern to investors. Proceeds from recent bond issues have mainly been used
to finance capital expenditures, although some issues were acquisition related.

III-9
After substantial issuance of commercial paper in June and July by firms
seeking immediate financing to complete mergers, offerings moderated in
August, and the incoming data suggest a net paydown of commercial paper in
September. Commercial and industrial loans at banks also slowed in late
August and so far in September, perhaps because more firms were able to tap
the capital markets.
Recent indicators of credit quality in the business sector continue to point to
some deterioration. The junk bond default rate on a year-to-date basis rose to
5.5 percent of outstandings in August, its highest level since 1991, when the
default rate was 9 percent. The staff's model for forecasting the default rate for
junk bonds predicts some further deterioration ahead. Broader measures of
credit quality also signal that some slippage has occurred. The year-to-date ratio
of liabilities of failed businesses to total liabilities remained above the average
of recent years. In addition, Moody's downgraded $110 billion of corporate
debt in August after three months of net upgrades, bringing the net amount of
debt downgraded since the start of the year to $270 billion, and debt on watch to
be downgraded slightly exceeds that on watch to be upgraded. It now appears
that 2000 will be the first year since 1992 with a net downgrade of corporate
debt. Overall, credit quality measures appear to be consistent with relatively
wide spreads of corporate yields over swap rates.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Yields on AAA-rated commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have
changed little since the August FOMC meeting, about in line with swap rates.
CMBS issuance has been relatively light in the third quarter, and commercial
mortgage debt from all sources apparently expanded at a 6-1/2 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, the smallest quarterly rise since early 1997.
Delinquency rates for commercial mortgages at banks and insurance companies
and in securitized pools have remained near their historic lows. The fast pace of
commercial mortgage growth in recent years is probably helping to hold down
delinquency rates because many of these new mortgages have not yet reached an
age at which default is most likely to occur.
Household Finance
Financial conditions in the household sector continued to be fairly strong,
although the decline in broad stock market indexes since the last FOMC meeting
led to a slight erosion in the value of household assets over the third quarter.
With declining share prices and increased market volatility, inflows to equity
mutual funds dropped in August to the lowest monthly pace of the year, but the
incoming data indicate a moderate recovery in inflows in September. Equity
mutual fund investors continued to favor technology-laden capital appreciation
funds and international equity funds over less-risky total return funds. Bond

funds recorded net outflows in August but have received some meager inflows
thus far in September.
Available data for the third quarter point to household debt growth a shade
below the very strong second-quarter pace. As housing activity has cooled off a
bit, mortgage debt is estimated to have decelerated a little after advancing at a
10-1/2 percent rate in the second quarter. The expansion of consumer credit
also appears to have edged down in recent months, from the 9 percent pace in
the second quarter, but it has remained robust to help finance growing outlays
on consumer durables.
Household debt-service burdens have continued to rise, but the latest measures
of debt repayment performance show few signs of deterioration in credit quality.
Through July, delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans at finance
companies were little changed at low levels, as were delinquency rates for
mortgages loans. Per capita personal bankruptcies fell 11 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter, to the lowest level in almost four years. Interest rates
on consumer loans, new auto loans at banks, and residential mortgages have
changed little over the intermeeting period.
Treasury Finance
The federal government continued to pay down its debt over the intermeeting
period, bringing the total paydown of marketable debt in the third quarter,
including debt buybacks, to $48 billion. The coupon sector accounted for a little
over two-thirds of the amount retired, which is consistent with the
Administration's efforts to keep the average maturity of its debt from rising.
The Federal Reserve's ongoing redemptions of government securities should
continue to provide support to issuance of new Treasury debt to the public.
Since early July, when the System Open Market Account (SOMA) adopted
limits on its holdings of individual Treasury debt issues, the Federal Reserve has
redeemed about $13-1/2 billion of government securities at Treasury auctions,
$12-1/4 billion of which is in bills. The bill redemptions roughly offset the
Treasury's paydown of such securities, leaving the amount of bills held by the
public little changed since midsummer. SOMA purchases of Treasury coupon
securities to replace redeemed bills have added to the net decline in the public's
holdings of longer-term issues.
On August 24, the Treasury conducted its first debt buyback operation involving
callable securities, purchasing a total of $750 million, and on September 21 it
bought an additional $1.5 billion of noncallable bonds. Those operations, along
with the one scheduled for September 28, will bring the total amount of debt
repurchased since the inception of the buyback program in March to
$22-1/4 billion. The Treasury still intends to buy back $30 billion by year-end.

Over the intermeeting period, auction sizes have remained unchanged in both
the bill and note sectors. Going forward, the large inflow of tax receipts in
September could potentially allow the Treasury to delay the temporary increase
in the size of weekly bill auctions that was announced in early August.
Agency Finance
Agencies issued substantial debt during the intermeeting period. Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac sold a combined $10-1/2 billion of Benchmark and Reference
notes, lifting the total amount outstanding of such notes and bonds to about
$274 billion. Fannie and Freddie have also continued to issue a large volume of
other securities, and issuance by the Federal Home Loan Bank System has
remained strong. In addition, in September Freddie Mac launched its
EuroReference note program, under which it plans to conduct regular auctions
of euro-denominated debt. The first auction of E5 billion of ten-year notes was
oversubscribed but only after the notes' spread over yields on German bunds
widened slightly above the range expected by Freddie Mac.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced their 2001 issuance calendars for
Benchmark and Reference securities. Both agencies increased the number of
scheduled offerings, especially of shorter-dated notes, and adopted a borrowing
calendar that is very close to that of the Treasury. In particular, their schedules
call for several sales of Benchmark and Reference securities within a week or
two of a major Treasury auction. Freddie Mac also introduced a number of
major initiatives, including quarterly offerings of thirty-year bonds, the adoption
of Internet-based Dutch auctions for two- and three-year notes, and suspension
of its callable Reference note program. Neither agency offered details on the
sizes of scheduled offerings.
The public discussion over the housing agencies' relationship with the federal
government has continued with little market reaction, and recent innovations in
the financial markets suggest that investors' interest in agency debt as a
potential substitute for Treasuries remains strong. Major brokers and dealers
now provide services that could facilitate the wider use of agency debt in pricing
and hedging of positions in the fixed-income markets, including the creation of
a long-duration benchmark index based on agency zeros and strips and direct
brokering of trades involving simultaneous positions in agencies and swaps and
in agencies and agency futures.1 The latter service also highlights the increasing
use of the agency futures contracts that started trading at the Chicago Board of
1. The direct trades involving positions in swaps and agencies allow market participants to
more easily use such instruments for hedging and arbitrage purposes. For instance, while market
participants have traditionally hedged swap positions with Treasuries, some have started to use
agencies as hedging vehicles. The brokered trades involving agencies and agency futures help
the further development of the agency futures market to the extent that they facilitate a tighter
and more transparent link between futures and cash prices in that market.

Trade in early March: After hovering around 40,000 contracts during most of
the summer, open interest in agency futures surpassed the 50,000 mark in early
September, a sizable number for such a young contract but still only about a
tenth of the open interest in ten-year Treasury notes futures.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term bonds by state and local governments in August
and September remained significantly below the robust pace of 1998 and 1999.
As has been true for some time, refunding activity has been lackluster, as higher
interest rates over the past year have made it unprofitable to refund old debt.
Issuance to raise new capital also has been held down by the strong fiscal
condition of states and localities. Indeed, credit quality improved further in the
state and local sector, with upgrades so far this year substantially outpacing
downgrades for the fifth year in a row. Not-for-profit health care providers
continue to account for a large share of total downgrades. Long-term municipal
bond yields largely moved up with Treasuries and corporate bond yields, and
yield ratios were little changed.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 growth picked up significantly in August and September following sluggish
growth in June and July. Strong transaction-related demands for money and the
waning effects of the latest monetary policy tightening in May appear to have
supported M2 growth. In addition, as noted, flows into stock mutual funds were
weak in August, perhaps indicating that investors redirected savings from
equities into M2 assets. Retail money market funds, in particular, bounced back
in August.
M3 posted another strong advance in August, largely funding the continued
brisk expansion in bank credit. Adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules,
bank credit advanced at an 8-3/4 percent rate in August, but the incoming data
suggest some slowing in both M3 and bank credit in September. Broad-based
loan growth continues to be the driving force behind the expansion of banks'
balance sheets, as securities ran off a bit last month. C&I loans grew strongly in
early August but have moderated more recently, perhaps reflecting the pickup in
issuance in the corporate bond market. Consumer loans at banks advanced at an
annual rate of more than 20 percent in August, fueled by a surge in credit card
debt. Real estate loans were the one segment that softened in August, but
growth has picked up again in recent weeks.
According to the most recent Survey of Terms of Business Lending, spreads of
C&I loan rates over the intended level of the federal funds rate widened slightly
between the May and August survey weeks and remain in the high range evident
since mid-1999. Consistent with anecdotal reports, the tightening has been
concentrated among large loans having above-average risk.

The value of exports of goods and services declined 1.5 percent in July,
reversing part of the extraordinary jump recorded in June. Even so, the level of
exports in July is 1.5 percent higher than the second-quarter average. The
decline in exports from June to July was primarily in aircraft and automotive
products, with smaller decreases in most other trade categories. The notable
exception was machinery (excluding computers and semiconductors) which
increased further; exports of machinery accounted for one-quarter of the jump in
exports in June.
The value of imports of goods and services rose 0.6 percent in July following a
strong rise in June. The level of imports in July was 2.9 percent higher than the
average for the second quarter. The increase in imports from June to July was
largely in industrial supplies, automotive products, and services. There were
small declines in the value of imported consumer goods, machinery, and oil (the
price of oil rose and the quantity of imported oil declined).
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The price of imported oil (BLS) rose slightly in August. For July and
August on average, the oil import price index increased 30 percent at an annual
rate from the second quarter. Through most of August and early September,
spot oil prices surged higher, driven by strong demand, concerns about low

inventories, and the threats to supply posed by hurricanes and Iraq. Shortly after
the spot price of West Texas Intermediate moved above $37 per barrel, oil prices
eased somewhat as the U.S. government announced that 30 million barrels of oil
would be released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Spot WTI is currently
trading around $32 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods, as well as core goods
(which exclude computers and semiconductors), increased slightly in August,
led by rising prices for industrial supplies (prmarily natural gas and unfinished
metals). For July-August combined, prices of core goods rose 2.1 percent at an
annual rate, only marginally more than in the previous two quarters. The
increase was attributable to industrial supplies and, to a lesser extent, to
automotive products. The price indexes of imported machinery, consumer
goods, and foods all declined in July-August.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports declined moderately in August. For the
second consecutive month there was a sharp decline in prices of agricultural
exports, largely grains and oilseeds. For July-August combined, agricultural
export prices fell 15 percent at an annual rate. While prices of nonagricultural
exports fell slightly in August, for July-August combined prices of
nonagricultural exports, and core goods, rose slightly. The price decline in
August was largely in industrial supplies led by prices of chemicals and fuels,
both of which generally follow (sometimes with a lag) movements in oil prices.
U.S. Current Account through 2000:Q2
The U.S. current account deficit rose to $425 billion at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the second quarter of 2000, an increase of $19 billion over the first
quarter (revised). The increase in the current account deficit was driven by a $17
billion (annual rate) widening in the deficit on goods and services. The deficits
on investment income and unilateral transfers widened slightly in the second
quarter. For portfolio investment income, payments increased $6 billion more
than receipts (at annual rate). On the other hand, for direct investment income,
receipts rose $5 billion more than payments, also at annual rate. The increase in
net outflows of unilateral transfers was mostly the result of a small increase in
U.S. government grants.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) rose $12 billion in July after a similar increase
in June. Thus far this year, reported increases in reserve assets of OPEC
countries have been modest. However, increased oil export earnings have
apparently permitted Russia to bolster its reserves in the United States, which
have increased each month since last October, rising from $3 billion to $15
billion durng the October 1999 -July 2000 period. Partial data from the
FRBNY show that between end-July and mid-September foreign official
reserves in the United States increased by an additional $4 billion.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities slowed slightly in July but
continued at a strong pace (line 4). Net purchases of corporate stocks accounted
for an unusually high 70 percent of the total. There were also modest net
purchases of corporate and agency bonds. Net sales of Treasuries continued for
a third consecutive month, but at a much slower pace than in June. In July both
the purchases of corporate securities and the sales of Treasuries were
concentrated in Europe, while the majority of agency bond purchases went
through Japan. Year-to-date sales of Treasuries have been more than offset by
purchases of agencies.

IV-7
U.S. net purchases of foreign equities (line 5b) reached a record high of almost
$15 billion in July, easily exceeding the previous monthly high of $10 billion set
in March 1996. Net equity purchases occurred primarily in Europe, while there
were modest net sales in Japan. U.S. residents also acquired an additional $5
billion in foreign equity as a result of equity-financed takeovers of U.S.
companies by European multinationals (shown separately in line 5c).1 Net sales
of foreign debt securities continued for a fourth consecutive month (line 5a),
with small purchases in Europe more than offset by sales in Japan and the
Caribbean financial centers.
The U.S. banking sector recorded a net inflow of $20 billion (line 3) in July as a
result of increased flows into U.S. agencies and branches from their related
foreign offices. This followed an outflow of $13 billion in June.
Recently released balance of payments data for the second quarter showed
foreign direct investment flows into the United States increasing significantly to
$80 billion (line 7). Approximately half of this inflow was associated with
merger and acquisition activity, with the acquisition of Atlantic Richfield by BP
Amoco alone accounting for over $27 billion. U.S. direct investment abroad
decreased slightly to $38 billion.
Foreigners increased their holdings of U.S. currency by $1 billion in the second
quarter following a decrease of $7 billion in the first quarter (line 8). The
decrease in the first quarter reflected a rebalancing of positions after a buildup
late last year in anticipation of the century date change. The modest increase in
the first quarter is a return to a more typical pattern.
The statistical discrepancy (last line) was negative $43 billion in the second
quarter, almost exactly offsetting the first quarter's positive $44 billion. (A
negative statistical discrepancy indicates a combination of over-recorded net
capital inflows and under-recorded net exports.)
In addition to the new line showing stock swap acquisitions, another line, the
"Capital account balance," has been added to the table to conform to IMF and
BEA conventions. This balance captures debt forgiveness and certain other
transfer-like transactions, and appears near the bottom of the table before the
"Statistical discrepancy" line. This line will generally be small for the United
States, but amounted to negative $3.5 billion in 1999, owing primarily to the
transfer of the Panama Canal.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The dollar moved up against the major currencies following the August FOMC
meeting, but the dollar's appreciation, particularly versus the major European
currencies, was curbed on Friday September 22, when the Desk participated in
joint intervention operations to purchase euros with the European Central Bank,
the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. Prior to the
intervention, the dollar had risen 2-1/4 percent on a weighted average basis against
the other major currencies since the August FOMC meeting. Following the
intervention, this gain has been cut in half. On balance, the dollar has risen
1 percent against the major currencies over the intermeeting period.

June July August September
Prior to the intervention operations, the dollar's overall rise was led by a
5/2 percent appreciation against the euro and a 41/ percent rise versus the British
pound. On August 31 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank
raised official interest rates 25 basis points, stating that part of the reason for the
increase was to counter the inflationary impact of the euro's weakness. The rate
hike failed to stabilize the exchange value of the euro, which continued to fall as
negative market sentiment toward the currency mounted, in part on concerns
over capital flows out of the euro area. Various European officials commented
on the single currency, but their messages were mixed. The failure of foreign
exchange markets to respond to the cajoling led to calls for official intervention
in the foreign exchange market to support the euro.

IV-10
On September 14 the ECB announced that it would repatriate €2.5 billion of
interest earnings on its foreign exchange portfolio, stating that the operation was
not for intervention purposes. Most market participants, however, considered
the ECB's repatriation operations to be de facto intervention. In the event, these
operations, which took place between September 14 and September 22, had little
effect on the value of the euro, which touched a new low against the dollar
during this period. On September 22, a few hours after the day's repatriation
operation, the joint intervention operation commenced. For this operation, the
Desk sold $1.33 billion for the accounts of the Treasury and the System. The
European Central Bank sold , the Bank of
Japan purchased a very large amount of euros, while the Bank of Canada and
Bank of England each bought a small sum of euros. This was the first operation
for U.S. accounts since June 17, 1998. Immediately following the first wave of
the intervention operation, the European Central Bank released a statement that
at their initiative, the monetary authorities of the United States and Japan had
joined the ECB in concerted intervention in exchange markets because of the
shared concern over the potential implications of recent movements in the euro .
This announcement, together with the overall size of the operation, served to
immediately boost the euro. Since the afternoon of the operation, the euro has
traded in a relatively narrow range. The communique stemming from the
September 23 G-7 meeting, which stated that exchange rates would continue to
be monitored and that member nations would cooperate in the exchange market
as appropriate, appeared to have little net effect on the exchange value of the
euro. On balance, the dollar appreciated 2 percent versus the euro over the
intermeeting period.
The August 31 rate hike by the ECB was largely anticipated by market
participants, and had little effect on short-term interest rates in the euro area.
Share prices in the euro area fell about 4 percent on declines of around
10 percent in the manufacturing and construction sectors.
The dollar appreciated 2 percent against the British pound. For most of the life
of the euro, sterling seemed to be more closely linked with the dollar than with
the euro. However, over the past two months, sterling's moves against the dollar
have been closely linked with movements of the euro.
The dollar depreciated 1 percent versus the yen during the intermeeting period.
The yield on ten-year Japanese government bonds rose 10 basis points amid
annual wrangling over the size of the supplementary budget and renewed interest
by market participants in the Japanese government's aggregate fiscal condition.
The yield on the ten-year Japanese government bond, at 1.9 percent, is near the
upper end of the narrow 30 basis point range it has been in since March 1999,
when the Bank of Japan initiated its zero-interest-rate policy. Since August 11,

IV-11
when the Bank of Japan boosted the near-zero overnight rate to 25 basis points,
the yield on the ten-year JGB has risen nearly 20 basis points.

The U.S. dollar appreciated 7 percent against the Australian dollar, which hit its
lowest value against the U.S. dollar since the currency became free floating in
1983. The Australian dollar was hurt by a softening in mineral and agricultural
commodity prices, and by renewed attention by market participants on
Australia's large current account deficit. The U.S. dollar also appreciated
1 percent against the Canadian dollar.
The exchange value of the dollar increased 1 percent versus the currencies of our
other important trading partners, due largely to a 1-1/2 percent appreciation versus
the Mexican peso. Although the price of oil hit a new post-Gulf War high, the
Mexican peso was hurt by concerns that Mexico's current growth rate may be
unsustainable. The dollar also appreciated 1-1/2 against the Brazilian real, as the
inflation rate in Brazil rose above market expectations during the intermeeting
period. Brazilian equity prices fell 5 percent, while Mexican equities gained
2-1/2 percent.

Share prices in the emerging market economies in Asia came under pressure,
particularly in countries with the highest concentration of chip-making
companies, which were hurt by softness in the spot market for memory chips and
concomitant worries of overcapacity in the industry. Share prices in Korea,
which declined 17 percent, were further weakened after Ford declined to
purchase Daewoo Motors, reigniting fears over the Korean governments ability
to restructure the chaebol. The Philippines peso came under pressure,
depreciating 23 percent against the dollar. To support the peso, the central bank
of the Philippines raised its key overnight rate 100 basis points and the bank also
acknowledged that it had intervened in the foreign exchange market. The Thai
baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened substantially, declining 3 and 7 percent,
respectively, versus the dollar.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the August Greenbook confirm that economic activity in the
foreign industrial countries was strong in the second quarter, but the limited
forward-looking indicators now available suggest some moderation in the pace
of growth in the current quarter. Second-quarter data for Japan were positive on
balance, but concerns about the durability of the Japanese recovery remain.
Growth in the second quarter picked up in the United Kingdom and continued at
a strong pace in the euro area, but moderated somewhat in Canada.
The surge in oil prices has left a noticeable imprint on broad measures of
inflation in recent months. However, core consumer price data show little
evidence of inflationary pressures in most of the foreign industrial countries.
Headline consumer price inflation in the euro area, at 2.3 percent in August,
remained above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling, while core
inflation edged up to 1.5 percent. Headline Canadian inflation moderated to 2.5
percent, within its target band, while core inflation was only 1.5 percent. U.K.
consumer price inflation remains below its target rate, and in Japan twelve-
month consumer price inflation remains negative.
In Japan, economic activity continued to expand in the second quarter, with real
GDP up 4.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the previous quarter. The increase was due
primarily to a 66 percent (a.r.) increase in public investment and a 4.5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) rise in private consumption. Recovery remains fragile, however, as the
high level of government investment is not expected to be sustained beyond the
current quarter. Although the increase in consumption is a positive sign, this
sector has been quite volatile, and the latest household expenditure data showed
a decline in July to a level more than 2 percent below the second-quarter
average. Shipments of machinery and housing starts were also below their
second-quarter averages in July. In contrast, the July level of industrial
production was about percent above the second-quarter average.
The unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent in July, a little below the peak
level of 4.9 percent reached earlier this year; the job-offers-to-applicants ratio
continued to rise. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which
exclude fresh food but include energy) continued to slide, down 0.8 percent in
August from a year earlier. The wholesale price index for domestic goods was

IV-15
slightly higher than its level of a year earlier, but this increase largely reflects
higher energy prices. The GDP deflator in the second quarter was down almost
2 percent from its year-ago level. Residential land prices declined once again.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first eight months of 2000 was $113
billion (s.a.a.r.), up from $109 billion in the same period last year. Denominated
in dollars, exports were up 20 percent from year-ago levels, largely owing to a
continuing surge in exports to the developing Asian economies. Imports were
up 26 percent, partly reflecting a jump in the value of oil imports.

In the euro area, real GDP rose 3.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter.
Consumption expenditures increased 4.2 percent, marking the second
consecutive quarter of robust consumption growth. Fixed investment spending
was unchanged in the second quarter, after increasing 7.9 percent the previous
quarter. The arithmetic contribution of net exports trimmed 0.6 percentage
points from GDP growth, as strong export growth was more than offset by a
surge in imports. Inventory accumulation contributed 2 percentage points to
growth. Among the major euro-area countries, growth in Germany picked up
markedly, primarily reflecting strength in domestic demand. In France and Italy,
however, growth was somewhat disappointing, reflecting weaker-than-expected
consumption growth in France and a substantial decline in Italian net exports.

The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area remained 9.1 percent in
July, its lowest rate since July 1992. (In constructing the harmonized
unemployment series, Eurostat standardizes national statistics to International
Labor Organization definitions.) In France, Germany, and Italy, unemployment
rates remain above the euro-area average, although they have declined
noticeably over the past year. In several smaller euro-area countries,
unemployment rates are at 20-year lows, reaching 4.5 percent in Ireland and
almost 2.5 percent in the Netherlands.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in the twelve months to August, with
higher energy prices keeping headline inflation above the European Central
Bank's 2 percent target ceiling. Excluding energy prices, the twelve-month
inflation rate edged up to 1.5 percent. In September, although the Italian
inflation rate remained unchanged, German inflation rose sharply to 2.4 percent.
Limited available indicators suggest that while economic activity remained
strong in the third quarter, euro-area growth is no longer rising. After moving
up sharply late last year, euro-area economic sentiment has been unchanged

IV-18
since March, although it remains at a high level. Euro-area purchasing
managers surveys for August indicate that manufacturing activity eased
somewhat from the high levels recorded earlier this year. In Germany, industrial
production increased 3.7 percent in July, largely reversing a decline in June, and
the volume of German industry orders rose 0.2 percent in July. However, the
German Ifo Business Climate index ticked down for the third consecutive month
in August.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP rose 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r) in the second
quarter of 2000, up considerably from its first-quarter pace. Total domestic
demand rose 3.7 percent, led by growth in private and government consumption
expenditures. The large increase in government spending is a bounceback from
the first quarter, as government agencies carried funds into the second quarter.
The contribution of net exports to GDP growth was slight.
Despite the rebound from a modest pace of growth in the first quarter, indicators
suggest that growth is slowing. Industrial production edged down slightly in
July. Business confidence picked up somewhat in August, but remains
considerably below levels recorded earlier this year. New orders fell again in
August, primarily due to weaker prospects for export orders. Increases in retail
sales have been surprisingly low given heavy price discounting of consumer
goods. Consumer confidence has also fallen since early this year.

The official claims-based unemployment rate fell to a 25-year low of 3.6 percent
in August, and the labor force survey measure of the unemployment rate fell to
5.3 percent for the three months centered in June, a record low. Nonetheless,
twelve-month growth in average earnings has moderated in recent months, to
3.8 percent in July. This rate is now below the 4.5 percent rate that the Bank of
England has suggested as compatible with its inflation target.
Producer input prices have risen sharply in recent months, in part reflecting
higher oil prices. The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest rates) remains below the 2-1/2 percent target.
Real GDP in Canada was stronger than expected in the second quarter, rising
4.7 percent (s.a.a.r) from the first quarter, and only slightly below the growth
rate in each of the previous two quarters. Domestic demand rose 4.3 percent,
led by surging business investment and stronger than expected personal
consumption growth. Export growth, while moderating somewhat from the
previous two quarters, still rose a strong 8.5 percent in the second quarter.
Notably, industries producing high-technology commodities accounted for close
to half of the second quarter growth in real GDP, underscoring the increasing
importance of high-technology industries in Canada.

Economic activity in the current quarter appears to have moderated somewhat,
but still retains considerable strength. The merchandise trade surplus narrowed in
July, reflecting a 2.9 percent decline in exports from June. In addition,
employment in July and August, on average, was essentially unchanged from the
second quarter, following rapid employment growth the previous year. As a result
of a surge in the labor force participation rate, the unemployment rate
moved up in August. Despite these signs of slowing however, both retail sales
and new and unfilled orders for manufactured goods grew strongly in July,
suggesting economic growth remains robust.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation moderated to 2.5 percent in
August from 3.0 percent in July, largely due to lower energy prices. The twelve-
month core rate of inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was only 1.5
percent in August, the same as in July and well within the Bank of Canada's 1 to
3 percent target range. Wage increases have been contained, with average hourly
earnings increasing just above 3 percent in the first half of this year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic conditions in most of the major developing countries have continued
to be quite favorable. In Latin America, growth has picked up in Brazil and
remained robust in Mexico, but weakness in Argentine economic activity has
persisted. In developing Asia, activity has generally remained strong, although
growth seems to have moderated in several countries from the very rapid rates
seen in the first quarter. Political instability provides grounds for continuing
concern in several countries in the ASEAN region.
Despite the runup in oil prices and higher levels of resource utilization, there is
little evidence of a substantial increase in inflationary pressures in developing
countries, with Brazil and Korea being possible exceptions.
Driven by the strength of exports, external balances have improved in most of the
major Latin American countries (Brazil being an exception) and have also
generally improved or held steady in the ASEAN region. However, external
balances have deteriorated somewhat in Greater China due to rising imports.
In Mexico, revised data indicate that although real activity remains strong,
growth has slowed and appears to be settling at more sustainable rates. Real
GDP is now estimated to have risen 5.4 percent in the second quarter (s.a.a.r.)
following 12 percent growth in the first quarter. Indicators for the third quarter
also generally point to continued strength: exports grew over 5 percent (s.a.) in
both July and August, and the average unemployment rate for these two months
was 2.3 percent (s.a.), roughly the same as in the second quarter. July industrial
production fell on a seasonally-adjusted basis from a strong June figure, but rose
about 6 percent from its year-earlier level. Despite the spur to imports from rapid
growth of domestic demand, export strength has led to some narrowing of the
trade deficit in July and August. Concerned about the potential overheating of
the economy, the Bank of Mexico has kept monetary policy tight, and
twelve-month inflation held steady in August at single-digit levels, below the
government's target of 10 percent for this year.
In late August, the government of Mexico announced that it had made a
$3 billion prepayment to the IMF, fully repaying its debt to the Fund. One stated
goal of the government in retiring the IMF debt early is to allow the next
Mexican presidential administration to determine more freely the nature and
scope of its relationship with the Fund.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have suggested a pickup in
economic activity in the third quarter. Industrial output grew nearly 1 percent
(s.a.) in July and automobile production rose considerably in August, fueled by a
strong increase in shipments abroad. A pickup in domestic demand contributed
to stronger import growth, leading to a widening of the trade deficit in August
from its levels earlier this year, although the deterioration also reflected higher oil
imports. Monthly consumer price inflation was higher in July and August
relative to the first half of 2000, driven in large part by an increase in food prices
owing to bad weather, a rise in the domestic price of fuels, and increases in other
government-controlled prices. Other price indices have pointed to a fall in
inflation so far in September. Analysts expect that the government will refrain
from further increases in domestic fuel prices until after the municipal elections
in late October.
A rise in "core" inflation in July/August and the potential inflationary effects of
the latest oil price increases put a halt to the round of monetary loosening in
recent months. The central bank's monetary policy committee held its key
overnight interest rate (the Selic) steady at 16-1/2 percent at its August and
September meetings, and left the bias at neutral. The government has continued
to record fiscal surpluses well in excess of its IMF program targets. In late
August, the federal supreme court ruled that the government must compensate

IV-28
worker special savings accounts (a type of government insurance program) for
past inflation. This ruling, which had been widely anticipated for several months,
is expected to increase the federal government's debt by roughly 4 percent of
GDP over the next several years.
In mid-September, the Brazilian government issued a seven-year
euro-denominated bond priced at 450 basis points over comparable German
Treasuries. This new issue and the government's exchange of Brady bonds for
new forty-year bonds in August further the government's objectives of
developing yield curves in various foreign currencies to facilitate private sector
issues and of lengthening the maturity structure of the Brazilian government's
foreign debt.

In Argentina, data suggest that the recovery faltered in the first half of the year.
GDP fell 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter after a 1.5 percent drop in the
first quarter. More recent indicators have been mixed. Consumer prices declined
in August, while industrial production jumped, although this follows sharp
declines in previous months. Exports grew 14 percent in July from their year-
earlier level. In addition, construction activity rebounded in August, hinting at
the possibility of a pickup in this industry.

IV-29
Acknowledging the effect of weaker-than-expected economic growth on tax
revenues, the IMF agreed to revise the fiscal targets laid out in its stand-by loan
agreement with Argentina. The federal deficit ceilings for 2000 and 2001 are
now 1.8 percent of GDP and 1.4 percent of GDP, respectively, up from the
previous targets of 1.6 percent of GDP and 0.9 percent of GDP. Concerns over
the state of the domestic economy, the fallout from a recent senate bribery
scandal, and more general fears of the effect of oil prices on industrial country
performance have kept sovereign spreads elevated. Domestic short-term rates,
both on peso- and dollar-denominated deposits, have risen about 100 basis
points.

There are signs of further recovery in Venezuela. Real GDP rose 8.7 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, boosted by bulging oil revenues and high levels of
government spending. Bank loans and deposits have been rising in recent
months and in August stood about 23 percent over their very depressed
year-earlier levels. Inflation continued its downward trend, with a twelve-month
consumer price inflation rate of 15 percent in August. However, uncertainty over
the government's economic policies, Chavez's increasing willingness to tap the
earnings of the central bank and of the state oil company to fund government
spending, and continued capital flight remain sources of concern for investors.

In Korea, recent activity data have been mixed, but on balance suggest a
continued moderation of growth from the blistering pace of last year and earlier
this year. Real GDP growth moved below 5 percent in the second quarter, as
expansion of both consumption and fixed investment slowed and inventory
investment made a negative contribution. However, industrial production
increased at a healthy rate for the second consecutive month in July, boosted by
continued strong exports of computer and telecom-related goods, suggesting that
growth in the third quarter is unlikely to weaken further.
At its latest meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Korean central bank
decided to leave its overnight rate target unchanged at the 5 percent level
maintained since February, surprising many in the market who had been
expecting policy firming. Bank of Korea officials had recently expressed concern
over rising inflationary pressures, noting the increase in the inflation rate in
recent months to near 3 percent (reflecting in part higher oil prices). However,
the monetary officials appear to have been influenced by arguments put forward
by the Ministry of Finance stressing the need to keep interest rates stable in order
to facilitate ongoing restructuring of the banking system. The recent decision by
Ford to withdraw its $7 billion bid for troubled Daewoo Motor has refocused
market attention on still unresolved corporate restructuring problems.

The economic recovery continued in the ASEAN region. Both Singapore and
Indonesia recorded double-digit second-quarter growth rates (s.a.a.r.), and
second-quarter growth in Thailand and the Philippines exceeded market
expectations. Strong exports have been the driving force behind the recovery,
although domestic demand has also posted gains in Malaysia, the Philippines,
and Singapore. Despite the pace of economic activity, price pressures in the
ASEAN countries remained generally well-contained, although inflation rates
have moved up a bit in some cases. However, industrial production has stagnated
recently in some of the countries in the region.
Many parts of the ASEAN region are suffering from political problems. Having
recently survived the threat of removal from office, Indonesian President Wahid
experienced fresh setbacks after being named as the subject of two investigations
into recent scandals and after the murder of UN workers who were aiding
refugees from East Timor. In addition, his newly appointed cabinet has not been
viewed favorably by financial markets. In the Philippines, President Estrada's
image has suffered as a result of the hostage crisis in Jolo and unrest in the
province of Mindanao. In Thailand, it appears increasingly likely that Prime
Minister Leekpai will be voted out of office in scheduled parliamentary elections
this fall, increasing uncertainty over that country's prospects.

Incoming data point to ongoing robust expansion of economic activity in China.
Growth in industrial output picked up further in July and August, supported by
an increase in exports and stronger domestic demand. Retail sales figures
suggest that consumer demand continued to recover. Public sector investment
rose 13 percent in August from the same month a year earlier, significantly
faster than the rates registered earlier in the year. Despite the pickup in activity,
inflation remained very low. The trade balance swung into deficit (s.a.) in
August, as the combination of higher oil prices and strengthening domestic
demand drove imports sharply higher.

In August, the government announced a supplementary issue of $6 billion (about
0.6 percent of GDP) in special treasury bonds, which were sold to domestic
banks to finance increased infrastructure spending in the underdeveloped
western regions. The government also announced plans to lower
telecommunication costs and reduce internal trade barriers as part of a policy
package to boost private consumption further. Multilateral negotiations on
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) were reportedly in
their final stage, with most analysts now expecting China to join the WTO
before the end of the year. In September, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of
permanent normalized trade relations (PNTR) with China.
In Hong Kong, real GDP fell 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. The
weak performance was widely expected, given the extraordinarily strong growth
rate in the first quarter, and to some extent reflected incomplete adjustment for
the difference in the number of working days in the two quarters. However,
fundamental factors also played a role, with negative wealth effects associated
with recent declines in Hong Kong's stock market helping to depress private
consumption. Despite the weak data, the government raised its annual average
GDP growth forecast for this year to 8.5 percent from 6 percent. More recent
indicators suggest a return to positive growth, with exports up slightly (s.a.) in
the July-August period, relative to the second quarter. In addition, the
unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent (s.a.) over the June-August period,
despite rapid labor force growth. The twelve-month rate of decline in consumer
prices moderated in July and August, partly reflecting higher oil prices.

In Taiwan, industrial production rebounded strongly in August, following a
sharp drop in July. For the July-August period, production rose about
3/4 percent (s.a.) from the second quarter. Inflation in August fell to its lowest
rate this year, despite price hikes in some agricultural products due to two large
typhoons that hit the island that month. Monthly trade surpluses have narrowed
sharply since the second quarter, as robust private and public sector investment
has fueled an increase in imports. Taiwan registered a current account surplus
of $5.7 billion (a.r.) in the second quarter, down from $8.5 billion in the same
period a year earlier. Stock prices in Taiwan have fallen sharply over recent
weeks as investors remained skittish in the face of continuing revelations of
banking and corporate scandals being brought to light by the new government's
anti-corruption campaign.
