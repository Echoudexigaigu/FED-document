Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The growth of economic activity has cooled from the extraordinary pace of the
first half of the year. Private employment has been increasing more slowly in
recent months, and hours worked have changed little. The expansion in the
manufacturing sector has decelerated sharply, reflecting slower production in
the high-tech industries and small, but widespread, declines elsewhere. The
moderation in demand has been most apparent in residential construction and in
outlays for equipment and software, while the rise in consumer spending
remains relatively solid. The inflation picture has not changed much since the
last Greenbook: Increases in hourly compensation continue to move up, and
although large productivity gains are still offsetting most of the rise in hourly
pay, core inflation appears to be moving gradually higher.
Real GDP
According to the BEA's advance estimate, real GDP increased at an annual rate
of 2.7 percent in the third quarter. More recent source data suggest that the
BEA will nudge that figure down a touch, to 2.6 percent. Downward revisions

to the estimates of business outlays for equipment and software and the change
in business inventories slightly more than offset upward revisions to investment
in nonresidential structures and to construction activity by state and local
governments. The recent source data and their implications for real GDP are
discussed in more detail later in the text.1
Labor Market Developments
Growth in labor demand has stepped down appreciably since midyear, but
despite the slowdown, there has been no easing of the tightness in the labor
market. The unemployment rate has fluctuated narrowly around 4 percent over
the past year, with the last two monthly readings at 3.9 percent.
In October, strike-adjusted private nonfarm payrolls rose 110,000, following a
downward-revised gain of 153,000 in September.2 Since June, private nonfarm
employment growth has averaged 130,000 per month, down from the first-half
pace of 186,000.3 The slowdown in employment growth has been concentrated
in the manufacturing, retail trade, and help-supply services industries. Higher
energy prices and a rising dollar have hit the manufacturing sector in recent
months, and after posting a small increase in the first half, factory payrolls
declined 33,000 per month on average between June and October. Help-supply
services employment declined 6,000 per month, on average, between June and
October after having risen 14,000 per month in the first half of the year. Hiring
in retail trade has moderated to a rate of around 15,000 per month since
midyear, about half the pace seen in the first half.
In contrast, employment in the services industries--excluding help-supply--has
slowed little. And, because construction activity has remained at a high level
into early autumn, when seasonal cutbacks typically occur, increases in
construction jobs have been strong on a seasonally adjusted basis in recent
months. Similarly, employment in the real estate industry has risen for three
consecutive months, following a weak spring and early summer.
1. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to third-quarter GDP and its components are
based on staff estimates that take account of data received since the BEA's advance report.
2. The strike at Verizon Communications lopped about 85,000 off of employment in August
and boosted payroll growth in September by the same amount.
3. The BLS commissioner announced the preliminary estimate for the March 2000
benchmark revision. Based primarily on unemployment insurance records, which cover nearly
all employers, the BLS estimates that the benchmark will raise the level of payroll employment
by 392,000 in March 2000. The 0.3 percent anticipated revision is in line with the average
absolute revision over the past decade. The BLS will fold in the results of the annual
benchmarking to the payroll survey data with the June 2001 employment report by increasing
employment growth about equally in each month from April 1999 to March 2000.

Poor earnings results and reports of layoffs at dot.com firms have fueled
concerns that labor demand in the high-technology sector of the economy is
dropping off. However, there is as of yet no hard evidence of a slowdown in the
employment figures for the high-technology sector more broadly defined.
Unpublished BLS tabulations show employment growth in high-technology
intensive industries picking up slightly in the second half.4 Moreover, while the
outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray, and Christmas reported that layoffs
among dot.com firms topped 5,500 in October, laid-off workers are said to have
had little difficulty in finding new jobs elsewhere in the sector.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls has moved down on net in recent months to 34.3 hours in
October. The shorter workweek coupled with the moderation in employment
growth has kept aggregate hours essentially flat since the spring.
In the household survey, employment rose 261,000 in October following a
similar-size increase in September, and the labor force participation rate held at
67.0 percent. Since midyear, household employment has grown at about the
same rate as total nonfarm payroll employment. In aggregate, the
unemployment rate remained at its thirty-year low, with significant changes in
the rates among major demographic groups.
Most other indicators of labor market activity reinforce the picture of slower
labor demand: Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to run
at a higher level in recent weeks than we had seen in the first quarter; likewise,
employers have been posting fewer vacancies in the past few months, pushing
the help-wanted index well off its recent highs. In addition, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses reported that the percentage of firms
planning to expand employment declined from August to October. Respondents
to the Michigan and Conference Board consumer surveys have been less
optimistic about job prospects in the next six to twelve months.
Productivity remains on a strong upward trend. The advance estimate showed
that output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector rose at an
annual rate of 3.8 percent in the third quarter after posting a 6.1 percent rate of
4. High-technology industries include computer and data processing services, research,
development, and testing services, and the following manufacturing industries: industrial
chemicals, drugs, computer and office equipment, communications equipment, electronic
components and accessories, aerospace, search and navigation equipment, and measuring and
controlling devices.

increase in the second quarter.5 The incoming data on output and hours suggest
that growth of output per hour will be revised down a bit to an annual rate of
3.7 percent. Over the four quarters ended in 2000:Q3, productivity increased
about 5 percent, up from the 3 percent rise over the previous four quarters.

Industrial Production
Industrial production increased at an annual rate of 2-3/4 percent in the third
quarter, less than half the rate of expansion in the first half of this year. The
factory operating rate edged down in September to 81.2 percent, still close to its
long-term average; it has fallen almost half a percentage point since June.
The slowdown in the manufacturing sector has been widespread. The
production of construction supplies, industrial materials, and general business
supplies all fell sharply last quarter. A lower level of housing starts reduced
demand for wood and masonry products, while rising energy costs and
intensified import competition pressured the paper and steel industries.
Inventory-sales ratios at manufacturers and wholesalers in these industries have
moved up--most notably at steel service centers. Elsewhere, the production of
consumer durable goods excluding motor vehicles, computers, and
communications equipment fell faster in the third quarter than in the second, and
5. Our estimate of third-quarter productivity growth reflects a 2.9 percent increase in output
and a 0.8 percent decrease in hours of all persons. According to more detailed unpublished data,
hours of employees in the nonfarm business sector declined 0.3 percent last quarter--primarily
reflecting the weakness in manufacturing--and hours of self-employed and unpaid family
workers fell 5 percent.

the output of business equipment excluding high-tech goods and motor vehicles
and parts also decelerated.
Although growth in production of high-tech equipment and parts remains quite
strong, the gains last quarter were not as large as those earlier in the year. This
moderation accounted for almost half of the quarterly deceleration in total IP.
Growth in semiconductor output, which had soared at an annual rate of
109 percent in the first half of the year, slowed to 67 percent in the third quarter.
We continue to believe that the first-half burst in production was a response to a
temporary surge in demand for chips. During that time, equipment production
took off with the lifting of Y2K-related lockdowns, and some manufacturers
sought to stockpile chips in response to lengthening order lead-times and
shortages. Media reports indicate that fears of shortages have since eased and
that some equipment makers are now working off their stocks. Consistent with
these reports, spot prices for DRAM chips fell faster in October than some
analysts had expected.
Motor vehicle output, which increased at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent in the
first half of this year, fell 20 percent in the third quarter (annual rate). Although
production slowed in all major segments of the industry, the decline in
assemblies of medium and heavy trucks was particularly striking. The demand
for new trucks has weakened precipitously, and third-quarter sales were down
about 17 percent from the peak in the fourth quarter of 1999. Moreover,
orders backlogs for heavy trucks have plunged in recent months. Industry
contacts attribute the slump in demand to several factors, including higher
operating costs (especially fuel costs), declines in truck freight, and an excess
supply of late-model used trucks.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, available source data suggest that IP was
little changed in October. Weekly data indicate that motor vehicle assemblies
dropped 900,000 units (annual rate) last month, directly shaving 0.2 percentage
point from the change in total IP. Other industries for which we have weekly
physical product data also contracted in October, reducing IP another
0.2 percentage point; significant decreases occurred in electricity generation and
steel and appliance production. Offsetting those declines, industries for which
we have no weekly physical product data appear to have contributed about a half
percentage point increase to the production index; the production estimate for
these industries is based on flat October production worker hours and our
assumptions about productivity trends.
Fourth-quarter auto and truck assembly schedules are at 12.6 million units
(annual rate), which implies a noticeable pickup from the October level. But
the days' supply of light trucks is high, and the companies are putting off the
highest production to December, raising suspicions that actual production may
fall below schedules. Moreover, both GM and Chrysler announced one-week

II-12
shutdowns at several plants in late October and November in order to reduce
inventories. It does not appear that the latest schedules reflect the effects of
these closings, which are expected to cut this month's assemblies nearly
0.3 million units at an annual rate.

Other indicators of activity in the industrial sector are showing some weakness.
Real adjusted new orders for durable goods (Census M3 data) rose in both
August and September, but not enough to offset a large July decline. Outside of
high-tech equipment and electronic components, real adjusted new orders have
declined, on balance, for the last two quarters, and they posted a significant
decrease in September. Purchasing managers indicated that new orders fell
again in October and that new export orders fell for the first time since January
1999. Other components of the purchasing managers' index also have
deteriorated from earlier in the year.
Consumer Spending and Income
Real consumer spending increased at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent in the third
quarter after having risen at a 3 percent pace in the second quarter.
Expenditures picked up for the major components of goods, though the largest
single contribution came from a bounceback in the pace of motor vehicle
purchases, which had fallen off significantly in the second quarter from the very
high pace of early this year. Outlays on services rose at an annual rate

of 3-3/4 percent in the third quarter, down from a 4-1/2 percent rise in the
second quarter; a sharp deceleration in energy expenditures accounted for the
slowing.
In October, light vehicle sales fell to an annual rate of 16.7 million units, down
400,000 units (2 percent) from the second-quarter average. Owing to an extra
boost to marketing incentives, GM was one of the few automakers to post higher
sales; most firms, including Ford, Chrysler, and the major Japanese firms, saw
moderate sales declines. Based on confidential data on fleet and retail sales, we
estimate that lower retail sales accounted for about two-thirds of the total
decline in October light vehicle sales. Fourth-quarter incentives remain
generous by historical standards, albeit less so than in the third quarter;
automakers expect that sales in the last two months of the year will hold close to
October's pace.
Current-quarter indicators for personal consumption expenditures outside of
motor vehicles are limited. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's chain store sales
index--which we have found to have some predictive content for the Census
Bureau's data on retail sales--dropped 2-1/2 percent last month. In addition,
recent weather conditions seem to point to a small decrease in outlays on
electricity and natural gas in October. By contrast, physical product data from
the Department of Energy indicate a sizable increase in real purchases of
gasoline in October. In addition, the volatility of equity prices last month

coincided with a rather heavy volume of transactions, suggesting that real
service expenditures might have received a noticeable boost from brokerage fees
and trading commissions.
Recent data on income, wealth, and consumer confidence seem consistent with
moderate consumption growth. Real disposable personal income rose at an
annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the third quarter, leaving the four-quarter change
at 3-1/4 percent--about in line with the slower pace of income growth that has
prevailed since early last year.6 Given the flatness of the stock market over the
summer, we estimate that the ratio of household net worth to disposable income
slipped last quarter for the second quarter in a row. And both the Michigan
Survey Research Center and the Conference Board indexes of consumer
sentiment indicate some slight softening in confidence recently. Nonetheless,
both indexes remain elevated by historical standards and thus do not suggest
major concerns on the part of households.
Housing Markets
Single-family housing starts fell 2.9 percent in the third quarter to a 1.23 million
unit annual rate, the lowest level since the first quarter of 1998. Permit issuance
for single-family construction decreased about in line with starts. Within the
quarter, however, there was a slight uptick in starts in August and September,
likely in response to a drop in rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which were down
about 70 basis points from their peak in May. Initial rates on adjustable-rate
contracts continued to edge up over the summer but have turned down recently.
The Census Bureau estimates that new home sales increased 6-1/4 percent in the
third quarter, to an annual rate of 910,000 units. Both the figure for the third
quarter and the sales pace for the year to date are about in line with the average
for 1999. Although the Census estimate is frequently subject to substantial
revision, we suspect that the decline in mortgage rates provided some lift to
demand. Sales of existing homes were little changed in the third quarter;
through September, sales for this year averaged nearly 4 percent below the rate
in 1999.
The most recent indicators of homebuying conditions are mixed. The buying
conditions index from the Michigan survey receded in October after having
rebounded somewhat last summer: Respondents took less favorable views of
housing prices and interest rates last month. However, builders' rating of new
home sales continued to rise slowly in October. But from a longer-term
perspective, these attitude indexes seem to be telling a more consistent
6. In September, real disposable personal income was boosted substantially (0.7 percentage
point) by specially authorized federal farm subsidy payments. Without this boost, real
disposable income would have grown at an annual rate of just 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter.

story--both remain substantially below the extremely elevated ranges observed
in the latter half of 1998 and the first half of 1999.
House prices continue to rise more quickly than overall inflation, but recent
increases have not been as large as those reported earlier this year. In the third
quarter, the constant-quality price of new homes sold was up 4 percent from a
year earlier; the second-quarter rise had been 5-3/4 percent on a year-to-year
basis.
In the multifamily sector, starts fell 12 percent in the third quarter, to an annual
rate of 299,000 units. However, the data for this sector are highly variable, and
the recent weakness follows a strong first half. Moreover, the market conditions
underlying the multifamily sector appear favorable. Although the vacancy rate
for multifamily rental units edged up in the third quarter, it remains in the low
end of the range of the past two years. Faster increases in rents--the
year-to-year rise in the CPI rent index in September was the largest in nearly a
decade--are also providing incentive for construction.7
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real expenditures on equipment and software
decelerated sharply in the third quarter; according to the advance estimate of
GDP, real E&S spending rose at an annual rate of 8-1/2 percent last quarter after
having risen at nearly a 20 percent pace in the first half of the year. Moreover,
recent incoming data that were not incorporated in the GDP figures suggest that
the increase in real E&S spending in the third quarter was probably closer to
6-3/4 percent (annual rate).
In the high-tech area last quarter, real expenditures both on computers and
peripherals and on software continued to advance at the robust rates seen earlier
in the year. Indeed, the strong gains in real outlays for computers and software
have continued this year despite smaller declines in computer prices and an
acceleration in software prices. By contrast, we estimate that real expenditures
on communications equipment fell at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third
quarter following increases at more than a 40 percent rate during the first half of
the year. This decline in spending, slumping stock prices of several large
producers and users of communications equipment, and increasing risk
premiums on the debt of telecommunications firms all raise the question of
whether a downshift in activity is under way in this sector. However, the latest
data on orders of communications equipment are more favorable. Although

orders fell sharply over the summer, they soared in September, and the backlog
of unfilled orders, already at an elevated level, edged up further.
Outside of the high-tech area, real equipment expenditures declined in the third
quarter, reflecting declines in spending on trucks and autos and on aircraft.
Expenditures on other types of equipment were little changed, on net, following
substantial gains in the first half of the year: Growth in outlays for industrial
and agricultural equipment slowed, and spending on construction and mining
equipment turned down. New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft and high-tech equipment rose in September and have edged up, on
balance, over the past two quarters. Moreover, orders consistently have been
running above shipments so far this year, resulting in a rising orders backlog
that should provide some support for shipments in coming months.
Nonresidential structures. Recent data on construction put in place (CPIP)
indicate that nonresidential investment in the third quarter was much stronger
than the BEA had assumed in its advance release. Our estimate is that real
investment in structures rose at an annual rate of 9-1/2 percent in the quarter,
up from a 4-1/2 percent pace in the second quarter.8
Taking account of the CPIP data, we estimate that construction of office
buildings increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the third quarter,
after having risen at an annual rate of 23 percent in the first half of this year.
Expenditures for office construction are up 12 percent over the past four
quarters. The fundamentals in this sector remain very favorable to further
growth: Vacancy rates in both downtown and suburban locations remain at
extremely low levels, and rent increases are still reported to be strong.
Construction of other commercial structures, which include retail space and
warehouses, declined at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, but the
level of expenditures is up 6-3/4 percent from a year earlier. Industry observers
report that investments in warehouse facilities built to handle modern inventory
and distribution systems continue to be viewed favorably. By contrast,
construction of new retail space is hampered by substantial investment already
in place in regional malls and "big-box" stores, as well as with continuing
uncertainty about the long-term effect of inroads by e-commerce on the demand
for retail space.
Our contacts suggest that financing for commercial and office construction
appears to be generally available; close scrutiny of projects by investors, rating
8. Nonresidential construction put in place rose 3.4 percent in September, and the August
gain was revised up sharply to 2.5 percent. Our estimate for third-quarter real NRS growth is
7-3/4 percentage points higher than the BEA's advance estimate.

agencies, regulatory authorities, and investment analysts is said to have limited
speculative ventures and helped preclude general overbuilding in the office and
commercial real estate markets. The data from financial markets generally
support these perceptions. Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities
(CMBS) has been well maintained. Furthermore, in recent months, yields on
AAA-rated CMBS have fallen to the lowest level in a year, and their spreads
relative to the ten-year swap rate have remained low. Yields for below-
investment-grade (BB rated) CMBS also have fallen, and spreads on these
issues declined through midyear and have risen only a little since then.
Delinquency rates on CMBS remained low through September, and
delinquencies on mortgages held by commercial banks and life insurance
companies stayed low through the second quarter (latest data). However,
commercial banks have apparently continued to view the risk associated with
commercial real estate lending with some concern: In the two most recent
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveys, one-fourth or more of the respondents
reported having tightened their credit standards for commercial mortgage loans.
Real outlays for industrial structures rebounded this year in response to falling
vacancy rates and the rise in manufacturing capacity utilization through the
second quarter. Expenditures increased 39 percent (annual rate) in the third
quarter and were up 20-1/2 percent from the year-earlier level. However, the
flattening of utilization rates since the spring will likely curb new construction
in the manufacturing sector to some degree.
Outside of the buildings category, investment in drilling and mining has
continued at a rapid pace, rising at an annual rate of 18 percent in the third
quarter. These expenditures were up 39 percent over the past year and
accounted for nearly one-third of the growth in total nonresidential structures
investment in that period.
Business Inventories
According to the advance GDP report, the real stock of nonfarm inventories
increased at an annual rate of about 5-1/2 percent in the third quarter.
Information that has become available since the advance report was released
would trim that figure to an annual rate of about 4-3/4 percent. Thus, for a
second consecutive quarter, inventories rose faster than real final sales, and
many aggregate inventory-sales ratios have moved up in recent months.
Although businesses on the whole do not appear to be uncomfortable with their
current levels of stocks, overhangs are apparent in some industries and have no
doubt contributed to the softening of production discussed earlier.
In manufacturing, current-cost inventories increased at an annual rate of only
$9.7 billion in September, well below the assumption that the BEA had
incorporated into its advance GDP estimate. Durable goods stocks changed
little in September, both at the aggregate level and in the industry detail. The

accumulation of nondurables in September was led by another sizable increment
to the stocks of chemical producers. The inventory-shipments ratio for all of
manufacturing is up only a little from its low of a few months ago, although that
is a departure from the downward trend of the past few years. Inventory-
shipments ratios for metals, construction materials, chemicals, textiles, and
rubber and plastics are at their highest levels in a year or more.
The book value of non-auto wholesale inventories rose at an annual rate of
$17.2 billion in the third quarter, about $5 billion below the level implicit in the
advance GDP estimate. Inventory accumulation in the third quarter was well
below the $33.1 billion pace recorded in the second quarter; growth of sales
slowed, and the ratio of inventories to sales edged up. As in manufacturing,
inventory-sales ratios are elevated in some wholesale sectors, notably for metals
and minerals, paper and paper products, and construction supplies.
The book value of non-auto retail inventories rose about $12 billion on average
in the July-August period, just below the pace in the second quarter. With sales
rising at about the same rate as the stock of inventories, the inventory-sales ratio
has shown very little net movement over the past few months. Within the retail
sector, inventories are high relative to sales at building material and hardware
stores and at motor vehicle dealers, but are low at general merchandise and food
stores. Elsewhere, on balance, the inventory-sales ratio has been relatively flat.
Government Expenditures
Federal sector. The federal government's unified budget surplus soared to
$237 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of $113 billion from a year earlier.
The on-budget surplus, which excludes social security and the postal service,
was $87 billion, compared with $1 billion a year earlier.
For the fiscal year, receipts rose nearly 11 percent, the highest rate in more
than a decade, propelled by another huge increase in personal income taxes.
Outlays also rose more rapidly than they had in recent years, reflecting, in
part, the high level of discretionary appropriations enacted last fall, legislative
initiatives that raised social security payments and agriculture spending, and a
pickup in Medicaid grants. The latter reflects the effects of the child health
insurance program passed in 1997 as well as new efforts by states to boost the
federal government's share of Medicaid expenses.
In September, receipts rose 9-1/2 percent relative to a year earlier, with sizable
increases in nonwithheld income tax and social insurance contributions and in
corporate income tax payments. September outlays were 8 percent higher than
those of a year earlier; much of the increase was attributable to timing shifts,

but agriculture spending surged as the emergency payments to farmers
included in last spring's legislation were disbursed.
Congress passed a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government
and then adjourned until after the election. After the recess, action is required
on five appropriations bills that have yet to be enacted. In addition, the agenda
is expected to include legislation to provide tax relief, larger payments to
Medicare providers, and a boost to the minimum wage.
State and local sector. According to the BEA's advance estimate, total real
spending by state and local governments on consumption and investment was
unchanged in the third quarter. But the September report on construction put in
place suggests a substantial upward revision, to an annual rate of increase of
about 2.5 percent. The BEA had estimated a 10 percent drop in investment
spending (annual rate); however, the CPIP data indicate that actual investment
by state and local governments edged up at an annual rate of 1.3 percent.
Consumption expenditures rose at a 2-3/4 percent annual rate--near the low end
of the range seen in recent years.
In October, state and local employment rebounded from the small decline
posted in the previous month; the gain of 20,000 was spread fairly evenly
among categories. Non-education employment growth was held down by
striking Los Angeles transit workers.
Looking forward, a recent survey of fiscal 2001 budgets submitted by governors
indicates that education tops the list of priorities, with most states focusing on
student performance standards and the hiring and retention of qualified K-12
teachers.9 Other education goals include school construction (with special
concern about technology for K-12 classrooms), school safety, and early
childhood development programs. Outside of education, states' policies are
aimed at tax cuts, technology-related initiatives, environmental programs, and
highway and other transportation-related infrastructure.
Around a third of the states had significant tax initiatives and legislative
referenda on the November ballot.10 Generally, most of the smaller measures
cutting taxes passed: Among the smaller reductions, roughly seven states
restricted property taxes in some way, and two states repealed their inheritance
taxes. Measures in Colorado and Oregon that would have had a significantly
negative impact on revenues failed. Very few measures on the ballot would
9. Revenues from states pay for about half of all K-12 expenditures nationwide.
10. An initiative is a measure placed on the ballot through the citizen petition process; only
24 states permit initiatives. Legislative referenda are measures that have been passed by the
legislature but require popular approval before they can become law. Legislative referenda
include constitutional amendments and bond questions.

have raised taxes. Among these, voters in Arizona approved a 0.6 percent
increase in the sales tax rate, with the proceeds earmarked for school
improvements.
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in September and was up 3.5 percent
over the past twelve months, about 1 percentage point more than over the
year-earlier period. Higher energy prices, along with a pickup in core inflation,
contributed about equally to the faster pace of overall CPI inflation over the past
year. Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 percent in September and
was up 2.6 percent over the past twelve months. On a current-methods basis,
the twelve-month change in the core CPI has moved up 0.5 percentage point
over the past year; excluding tobacco as well as food and energy, the
acceleration over the past year was 0.8 percentage point."
Core PCE prices have accelerated noticeably less over the past year than the
core CPI; the twelve-month change in core PCE prices in September was
1.7 percent, compared with an increase of 1.6 percent in the year-earlier period.
As we have discussed previously, the coverage and methodology of PCE prices
and the CPI differ in important ways, and movements in these indexes have
deviated from one another noticeably in the past. In particular, PCE includes
some items that are not in the CPI, and several of these "out-of-scope" items--
such as imputed charges for commercial bank services--do not have market
prices. The BEA imputes these nonmarket core PCE prices using a variety of
methods. Over the past year, an index of the nonmarket prices (constructed by
the staff) has decelerated considerably. In contrast, an index of the market-
based core PCE prices accelerated 0.3 percentage point over the past twelve
months, closer to the acceleration in core CPI.12 Furthermore, relative to their
lows over the past two years, both the current-methods CPI and the core PCE
have accelerated about 1/2 percentage point.
The CPI for energy rose substantially in September and was up more than
15 percent from a year earlier, reflecting the passthrough of higher crude oil
prices. We believe that the effects of higher crude oil prices had been fully
reflected in retail prices of gasoline and heating oil by September. Crude oil
11. After the September Greenbook was published, the BLS revised up slightly CPI figures
for this year to correct a programming error that affected the indexes for residential rent and
owners' equivalent rent. Although the errors affected data back to January 1999, the BLS only
revised data for this calender year. Because the BLS set the levels of this year's indexes at their
proper values, but did not change the indexes for 1999, there is now a discontinuity in the
published series between December 1999 and January 2000. The staffs current-methods index
includes an adjustment to the 1999 data that removes this discontinuity.
12. The components with market-based prices made up nearly 80 percent of core PCE in the
third quarter of this year.

prices eased slightly in October, and survey data for the month suggest declines
in retail prices of gasoline and heating oil. Natural gas prices rose substantially
further in September, and spot prices point to another increase in October.
Consumer electricity prices changed little in September for the second
consecutive month, following large increases during the summer.
The CPI for food rose 0.2 percent in September, the same rate of increase as in
August. The twelve-month change stood at 2.6 percent in September--the same
as the core index--and the amount of acceleration in food prices over the past
year was just a shade less than that registered by core inflation. The crop that is
being harvested this fall, though down from estimates made earlier, is still
expected to be ample.13 The path of futures prices through late 2001 has
changed relatively little in recent weeks and continues to suggest that farm
prices will contribute little to food price inflation in coming months.
Although core commodity prices in the CPI have decelerated over the past year,
this pattern reflects a sharp deceleration in tobacco prices, which had surged in
late 1998. Excluding tobacco, core commodity prices accelerated about
1/4 percentage point over the past year. This pattern of acceleration reflects
modest pickups in rates of inflation for many commodities, including new light
vehicles, and a slower rate of decline in computer prices.
The CPI for non-energy services rose just 0.1 percent in September--held down
by a decline in airfares. Nonetheless, these prices are up 3.5 percent over the
past year, a considerably faster rate of increase than in the prior twelve
months.14 Many items have contributed to this pickup. Airfares--despite the
decline in September--have accelerated sharply as jet fuel prices have risen. In
addition, the rate of increase in medical services has stepped up in the past year,
and rents have increased more rapidly in the past twelve months than in the
previous year.
Capital goods prices have shown clear signs of acceleration over the past year.
With an increase of 0.2 percent in the PPI for capital goods in September, the
twelve-month change in the index was 1.2 percent, up more than 1 percentage
point from its year-earlier pace. PPIs have accelerated for a wide range of
capital goods, including civilian aircraft, oil and gas field equipment, machine
13. Planting of the winter wheat crop that will be harvested next year got off to a late start
this fall because of extremely dry weather in some growing areas. Progress of the planting was
still lagging somewhat as of the first week in November. The condition of the crop in early
November was similar to that of a year ago and suggests that yields could still turn out to be
relatively high if the weather cooperates from this point on.
14. Because of a discontinuity in the CPI introduced with the BLS' correction of the
aforementioned programming error, the amount of acceleration in non-energy service prices is
overstated in the published figures by a bit more than 0.1 percentage point.

tools, and communications equipment. In addition, a small portion of the
overall acceleration owes to a slower rate of decline in computer prices; these
prices fell about 15 percent over the past twelve months, compared with a year-
earlier rate of decline in excess of 20 percent. Although not included in the PPI
for capital goods, software prices in the NIPAs have also accelerated
considerably in the past year.
The firming of investment prices has contributed to an acceleration in the
broader price indexes in the national accounts. Over the four quarters ended in

purchases increased 2.6 percent, almost 1 percentage point faster than in the
prior year.

and energy have been on the soft side recently. The PPI for core intermediate
materials was unchanged in September after rising 2.3 percent over the past
year. Although this pace of increase is faster than that of a year earlier, changes
in core intermediate prices have eased in recent months. The PPI for core crude
materials increased 0.3 percent in September after having declined in each of
the preceding six months. Although these prices moved up 2.5 percent over the
past year, this rate of rise is well below the double-digit increases that the
twelve-month change was registering earlier this year. Moreover, since the
mid-September pricing date of the PPI, the Journal of Commerce index of
industrial commodities has declined 5.2 percent, with lower prices for metals--
including steel scrap--forest products, and textiles.
Near-term inflation expectations picked up in October. The median response to
the University of Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations was
3.2 percent in October, up from the 3 percent pace that prevailed through the
first three quarters of the year.15 In contrast to the pickup in near-term
expectations, longer-term expectations remained relatively steady last month,
with the five-to-ten-year median expectation at 3.0 percent.
Labor Costs
The third-quarter gain in the ECI was less than the elevated rates of increase
registered in the prior two quarters; however, over the past twelve months, ECI
compensation per hour rose 4.6 percent, up considerably from the 3.1 percent
pace during the prior year. Faster increases in benefits costs--which accelerated
more than 3 percentage points over the past year--contributed importantly to this
pickup. Health insurance costs and nonproduction bonuses were a noticeable
15. The mean response jumped by more--from about 3.6 percent in the first three quarters of
the year to 4.1 percent in October; however, we tend to prefer the median response because the
mean measure can be strongly affected by a few extreme readings.

source of this acceleration in benefits, but rates of increase in the other major
benefit categories have moved up as well.
The ECI for wages and salaries also has moved up considerably over the past
year, following a sharp deceleration in 1999; at 4.1 percent, it is still below its
most recent peak, registered in the third quarter of 1998. This pattern mainly
reflects sharp swings in wage changes in the finance, insurance, and real estate
industry (FIRE), which surged in 1998 during the mortgage refinancing wave
and then subsided in 1999. Excluding FIRE, a persistent upward trend in rates
of increase is more evident than in the overall wage and salary figures.
The productivity and cost measure of compensation per hour is estimated to
have increased sharply in the third quarter, bringing the four-quarter change to
5.1 percent. Setting aside the difficult-to-explain surge in 1998 and subsequent
deceleration in 1999, P&C hourly compensation has accelerated considerably
since 1995. Both the ECI and the P&C measure show a similar amount of
acceleration over the 1995-2000 period, reflecting a combination of rising
productivity growth, tight labor markets, and--in recent years--higher price
inflation.
The October employment report provided the first look at wage developments in
the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers increased 0.4 percent that month, bringing the twelve-month change in
the wage measure to 3.8 percent. On balance, however, the rate of increase in
average hourly earnings has changed relatively little since the beginning of
1999. This stands in contrast to the acceleration over that period in the ECI for
wages and salaries of production or nonsupervisory workers--the ECI' s closest
counterpart to the average hourly earnings measure. There are, of course, many
differences in the construction of these two wage series, and they have often
diverged for significant periods of time. For one thing, average hourly earnings
includes the effect of swings in overtime hours, while the ECI does not. In
addition, the ECI uses fixed weights to aggregate industries and occupations,
while average hourly earnings is a current-weighted measure. Our sense from
looking more carefully at the recent divergence in these measures is that both
swings in overtime hours and changes in industrial composition have
contributed to the more sanguine view of wage pressures suggested by the
average hourly earnings data.16
16. A very rough gauge of these effects can be calculated by comparing average hourly
earnings for the manufacturing sector with and without overtime hours and by comparing overall
average hourly earnings with a measure adjusted (approximately) for changes in industrial
composition. Although the results are sensitive to the particular time period chosen for the
calculation, these estimates suggest that a small decline in manufacturing overtime and changes
in industrial composition held down the acceleration in average hourly earnings over the last
year and a half by something in the neighborhood of 1/4 percentage point relative to the
corresponding ECI measure.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Concerns about decelerating corporate earnings and revenues, particularly in the
telecom and internet sectors, led to considerable volatility in the equity market
over the intermeeting period. On net, however, broad equity indexes were off
only slightly. Yields on Treasury securities and most higher-grade private debt
instruments were also about unchanged. But the increased volatility, together
with the perception that economic growth has settled into a slower pace, made
market participants more wary about credit risk, causing yield spreads on lower-
grade bonds to widen sharply.
The pace of financing slackened over the intermeeting period. Corporate bond
issuance dropped off until very recently and remained concentrated in larger
issues, while equity issuance continued to be well below the pace earlier this
year. Nonfinancial commercial paper and business loans at banks were both
quite sluggish in October, and the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
confirmed that many banks have tightened terms and standards for C&I lending
in recent months. Little, if any, tightening was reported for consumer and
mortgage loans, which have continued to expand briskly.
Interest Rates and Stock Prices
Treasury yields increased several basis points in response to the statement
released after the October FOMC meeting, which market participants saw as
reflecting more concern about inflation than had been anticipated. Yields
dropped back over subsequent weeks, though, as tensions in the Middle East
and the choppy decline in equity prices led to heightened expectations of
Federal Reserve easing next year and to safe-haven flows into Treasury
securities. More recently, Treasury yields backed up as equity prices rebounded
and employment data showed a continued tight labor market.
On net over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury coupon yields were
about flat.1 Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell about 15 basis
points at the five-year maturity, and the wider spread below nominal Treasuries
suggests some increased concern about near-term inflation pressures.
Nonetheless, federal funds and eurodollar futures rates on contracts expiring
next year were little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, and
continue to suggest that the market is pricing in some chance of policy easing
next year.
In equity markets, a number of earnings warnings by well-known firms and a
paring back of analysts' earnings forecasts caused sharp declines in some stock
prices, but left broad indexes only slightly lower on balance. The tech-heavy
1. While private short-term rates were about unchanged, Treasury bill rates rose 10 to
20 basis points, likely reflecting supply pressures.

Nasdaq dropped nearly 15 percent in the first two weeks of October, but has
recovered much of that loss. Movements in the Wilshire 5000 and the S&P 500
were more muted and, on net, are about unchanged over the intermeeting
period. Option prices indicate that volatility is expected to remain high.
The perception that the economy is slowing led investors to become more
concerned about the credit quality of lower-rated corporate borrowers, causing
yield on the bonds of such issuers to jump. In contrast, agency spreads over
Treasuries receded some, helped in part by the announcement that Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae were adopting a number of measures to increase the
transparency of their balance sheets and strengthen their capital base and
liquidity.
Business Finance
Responding to warnings about third- and fourth-quarter earnings--especially
from such high-profile companies as Apple, Xerox, Dell, Lucent, and Home
Depot--equity analysts pared back forecasts of S&P 500 companies' earnings in
the twelve months ahead by more than 1 percent between mid-September and
mid-October. This was the largest monthly cut in almost two years. While the
revisions for most sectors were small in comparison to those that followed the
unfolding of the Asian crisis or the Russian default, the telecom sector has been
singled out for a more significant reassessment. This month likely will show
more of the same, given last week's announcements from WorldCom and Sprint
that their growth in 2001 will be well under that implied by analysts'
projections.
Projections for some computer-related technology firms were also trimmed in
the most recent month, but, overall, average forecasts in this sector showed very
little decline. For the remainder of the S&P 500, the modest forecast reductions
observed of late were consistent with the recent deceleration in economic
activity.
With nearly 450 third-quarter earnings reports now in, four-quarter growth in
S&P 500 earnings per share appears to have slowed to 11-1/2 percent, from
16 percent in the second quarter. Seasonally adjusted, their earnings are
estimated to have risen about 2 percent from their second-quarter level (at a
quarterly rate), a touch stronger than anticipated in the previous Greenbook.
As revisions to corporate earnings forecasts triggered price revaluations in
equity markets, gross public equity issuance was subdued. Telecom offerings,
which had accounted for more than 30 percent of the total proceeds this year,
fell in October. Several issuers withdrew or postponed offerings, including
Verizon Wireless, which put off an anticipated $5 billion IPO. In other sectors--
including biotech and energy--issuance has continued, albeit at a less robust
pace than in recent quarters. Together, initial public and seasoned offerings

totaled just over $6 billion last month, a bit below the average pace of the past
few years.
New data show venture capital investments down only slightly in the third
quarter from their gigantic first-half pace, and exceeding public market
issuance. As in the public market, it appears that Internet commerce continued
to fall out of favor, while the share going to biotech picked up. Industry
participants anticipate continued sizable investments as venture capitalists put
recently raised funds to work.
Announcements of share repurchases in the third quarter were sluggish, but total
share repurchases for this year are likely to be robust in light of earlier
announcements. And while merger announcements in the third quarter and in
October were mostly stock-financed deals, the pending list of cash-financed
mergers remains sizable, suggesting that net equity retirements will likely
remain substantial over the coming quarters.
In the bond market, risk spreads continued to climb in October, particularly in
the speculative-grade segment. By mid-month, the yield spread of junk bonds
over AAA-rated issues rose to a level last observed during the market disruption
in the fall of 1998. Current spreads are now broadly consistent with the staff
model of credit risk and do not seem excessive in light of the heightened risks
faced by high-yield investors. Moreover, while liquidity conditions in the junk
bond market reportedly have deteriorated, there is no evidence of the kind of
breakdown seen a couple years ago, and even some very low-quality offerings
have been marketed.
With both yields and spreads up, October recorded the lowest level of gross
bond issuance since April--$12-1/2 billion by nonfinancial issuers. Both
investment- and speculative-grade offerings fell to roughly half their year-
average pace. However, in early November, the market appears to have
strengthened, drawing a number of larger issuers off the sidelines.
Firms did not turn from bond markets to shorter-term sources in October.
Outstandings of nonfinancial commercial paper rose less than $3 billion in
October, only partially reversing the run-off in September. The October
weakness was partly attributable to the exit by Xerox from the CP market--
which paid down nearly $5 billion of outstandings--after a very unfavorable
third-quarter report suggested a faster-than-expected deterioration in Xerox's
competitive position.
Business credit at banks was also sluggish in October, apparently owing to both
softer demand and perhaps to the tighter standards that banks have been
reporting. On net, more than 40 percent of domestic banks in the November
Business Loan Practices Survey reported a tightening of standards on C&I loans

to large and middle-market firms over the past three months, the highest
proportion since November 1990. Tightening was even more prominent among
branches and agencies of foreign banks. Moreover, a large percentage of both
domestic and foreign banks also reported tightening loan terms and charging
higher premiums on riskier loans. Finally, more than half the respondents
reported that they expected standards and terms on C&I loans to tighten
somewhat further over the next year, even if the economy expands at a
sustainable rate.
Overall credit quality of U.S. businesses has deteriorated noticeably this year,
though measures suggest conditions stabilized somewhat in the third quarter.
Moody's rating changes resulted in an overall net downgrade of about
$112 billion last quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of net downgrades. The
aggregate liabilities of firms filing for bankruptcy fell off in the third quarter; on
balance, the ratio of failed to total liabilities is not running much above its 1999
level and remains near the middle of its range over the past decade. Although it
eased a bit in the third quarter, the default rate on outstanding junk bonds for the
year to date stood at an elevated 5.3 percent in September, and defaults have
been sprinkled fairly widely across sectors.

backed securities (CMBS) have declined along with the rate on comparable ten-
year swaps. CMBS issuance in the third quarter was little changed from its
second-quarter level, but commercial mortgage debt from all sources is
estimated to have moderated to a 6-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter, well
below the pace seen over the past couple of years. Delinquency rates on
commercial mortgages remain at historically low levels. Nonetheless, about a
quarter of the respondents to the November senior loan officer survey reported
that they had tightened standards on commercial real estate loans.
Household Finance
Available data for the third quarter suggest that household net borrowing in
consumer and mortgage markets cooled a bit from the first-half pace. The
robust growth seen in household debt through the third quarter helped push up
the household debt-service burden close to its peak in the mid-1980s.
Nonetheless, the latest measures of debt-repayment performance have shown
few signs of a deterioration in consumer credit quality. Moreover, households
hold lofty levels of assets relative to disposable income.
Credit conditions for households have not changed appreciably. Interest rates
charged by banks on new-car loans and on home equity lines of credit are
essentially unchanged since the last meeting. Also, interest rates on adjustable-
rate mortgages have changed little, while rates on fixed-rate mortgages have
declined roughly in line with those on ten-year Treasury notes. Little, if any,

tightening was reported for consumer and mortgage loans in the November
survey of loan officers.
Inflows to equity mutual funds decelerated in September and October yet
remained substantial in the face of declining equity prices and increased market
volatility. Those inflows continued to be steered disproportionately into riskier
domestic capital appreciation funds. In a break from recent trends, some bond
fund categories began showing positive net inflows in October.
Treasury Finance
The Treasury's surplus over the third quarter came in at about $60 billion,
allowing a paydown of about $54 billion in debt held by the public. Coupon
retirements accounted for more than half of this total--$26 billion through
redemptions and $8 billion through debt buybacks. On November 1, the
Treasury announced that it expects to pay down $23 billion in marketable debt
over the fourth quarter, a bit more than previously estimated. The Treasury
conducted two more buyback operations in October for a total of $3 billion.
Total debt buybacks for the year, at about $24 billion, are on track to meet
Treasury's $30 billion target.
At the midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasury indicated that it will
buy back $9 billion of securities in the first quarter of 2001. In response, the
yield on thirty-year bonds increased several basis points after the
announcement, as market participants were apparently expecting first-quarter
buybacks to be a bit bigger. In the refunding operation, the Treasury auctioned
$12 billion of new five-year notes and $8 billion of ten-year notes as a
reopening of the new securities issued in August.
Recent market volatility has been accompanied by only a small deterioration in
measures of Treasury market liquidity. The volume of primary dealer
transactions in government securities edged down over the intermeeting period,
while bid-ask spreads widened a little. Unlike some past episodes of market
turbulence, however, the spread between on-the-run and off-the-run securities
has not moved much lately.
Agency Finance
Issuance of agency debt continued at a strong pace during the intermeeting
period, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac selling a combined $23 billion of
Benchmark and Reference notes and bonds. In total, about $297 billion of these
securities are outstanding. Issuance of Benchmark and Reference bills has also
remained robust.
Agency spreads over Treasury yields are down a bit since the last FOMC
meeting. Spreads had widened early in the intermeeting period, along with
other corporate spreads, but narrowed appreciably on the October 20

announcement by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of measures designed to
strengthen their capital base and enhance disclosure and market discipline.
Specifics included plans to issue subordinated debt to increase total capital
relative to assets by roughly one-third and the implementation of risk-based
capital stress tests. Fannie and Freddie also pledged to continue to maintain at
least 5 percent of on-balance-sheet assets in a liquid portfolio of nonmortgage
securities and to disclose, on a monthly basis, their sensitivity to interest rate
risk and, on a quarterly basis, their exposure to credit risk. A portion of this
decline in spreads reportedly was attributable to investor perceptions that this
agreement reduced the risk that Congress would take steps to loosen the GSE's
remaining ties to the government.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term bonds by state and local governments picked up in
October, despite a further slackening in refunding activity. The increase was
driven by stronger issuance for new capital projects, which may have been
spurred by the easing of long-term yields and yields spreads since late summer.
Credit quality has improved further in the state and local sector this year, with
upgrades outpacing downgrades for the fifth straight year. The not-for-profit
health care sector remains the only notable exception to the rule of improving
credit quality.
Money and Bank Credit
Bank credit contracted 6-1/4 percent at an annual rate during October.
Securities holdings plunged 20 percent, reflecting runoffs at large domestic and
foreign banks. The drop was especially dramatic in trading accounts, but
investment accounts also shrank. Loans declined about 2 percent, as portfolios
of large domestic and foreign institutions contracted, and loan growth at small
banks slowed to 5-1/4 percent, roughly half the pace of recent months.
Commercial and industrial loans were about flat in October (on a month-
average basis), following anemic growth in September, reflecting both tighter
lending standards for businesses as well as weaker loan demand, according to
the November survey of loan officers. Commercial real estate loans contracted
a bit in October after slowing in the third quarter from the double-digit pace of
expansion earlier this year. Consumer loans are estimated to have risen about
3-3/4 percent in October, after adjusting for securitization and related activities.
Overall lending was also held down in October by security loans, which
dropped at large domestic banks after having expanded rapidly in the previous
quarter.
With reduced financing needs, banks ran off their managed liabilities, including
those in M3. M3 growth slowed appreciably--to a 4 percent pace--about half its

September advance. Growth of M2 also moderated to near a 4 percent annual
rate in October from its rapid pace in August and September. The slowing was
concentrated in liquid deposits and appears consistent with the less rapid pace of
expansion in nominal spending and the lingering effects of widening M2
opportunity costs last spring.
At twenty-four large bank holding companies that have reported their third-
quarter earnings, net income fell 3 percent relative to a year earlier. In general,
the largest banks with nationwide operations fared better than the smaller
regional bank holding companies, as revenue from investment banking and
investment management activities turned in better results than more traditional
lines of business. Net interest income rose only 1 percent, as net interest
margins fell about 50 basis points from a year earlier. With the notable
exception of four of the very largest banks, most institutions reported a
deterioration in the quality of their business loan portfolios and increased their
loan-loss provisions markedly. Several banks also took substantial charges in
their automobile leasing operations, in which realized residual values continued
to be much weaker than anticipated.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The November 2000 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. Supplementary questions addressed the extent
to which tighter credit standards have affected different customer groups, the degree to
which the increase in delinquency rates on commercial and industrial loans has been
anticipated, and banks' expectations about changes in credit policies over the next year.
Loan officers from fifty-seven large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey.
Over the past three months, the number of foreign and domestic banking institutions
that reported tightening standards and terms on C&I loans to large and medium sized
firms--44 percent and 80 percent respectively--exceeded the number that tightened
lending conditions following the financial crisis in the fall of 1998. About a quarter of
domestic and foreign banks also tightened standards for commercial real estate loans.
On net, demand for C&I and commercial real estate loans was reported to have
weakened somewhat over the past three months.
Over the past year, domestic banks applied tighter standards and terms most
aggressively on C&I loans intended to finance mergers and acquisitions (M&As) as
well as to new customers seeking lines of commitment. Foreign banks applied tighter
lending policies more evenly but most often targeted customers in selected industries.
Looking ahead, more than half of all banks indicated that they anticipate a further
tightening of standards and terms on C&I loans before the end of 2001. Substantial net
fractions of both domestic and foreign respondents also reported that the increase in
C&I loan delinquency rates over the past two years was somewhat greater than
expected.
Although a large fraction of domestic banks tightened lending policies in the business
sector, credit standards for all types of household lending were relatively unchanged
over the past three months. Almost all domestic banks reported very little change in
standards for residential mortgage loans, while only a handful banks had tightened
standards and terms for all types of consumer loans. Demand for both residential
mortgages and consumer loans reportedly weakened over the past three months.
Lending to Businesses
On net, more than 40 percent of domestic banks reported a tightening of standards on
C&I loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months. About a
quarter of domestic respondents, on net, indicated that they had tightened standards to
small firms over the same period. A full 80 percent of branches and agencies of foreign
banks reported somewhat tighter standards on C&I loans. The net percentage of
domestic and foreign respondents that tightened standards during the last quarter was
higher than the percentage of banks that had tightened in the aftermath of the Russian
debt crisis in the fall of 1998; in fact, the net percentage of domestic banks that
tightened standards on C&I loans is the highest it has been since November 1990. Even
if the economy expands at a sustainable rate over the next year, more than half of the

III-A-2
domestic banks and two-thirds of foreign respondents indicated that they expect a
further tightening of standards and terms on C&I loans over that period.
At least a third of domestic and foreign banks, on net, reported tightening each of the
loan terms listed in the survey for large and middle-market firms. Two-thirds of
domestic respondents and three-quarters of foreign branches and agencies charged
higher premiums on riskier loans, with no bank reporting an easing in this category. On
net, about half of both domestic and foreign institutions indicated a general increase in
spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds on loans to large businesses. The overall
tightening of terms on C&I loans to small firms was somewhat less. Among both
domestic and foreign institutions that had tightened standards or terms on C&I loans the
reasons most often cited for changing their lending policies were a less favorable or
more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, and a
reduced tolerance for risk. A significant fraction of foreign respondents also mentioned
an increase in defaults by below-investment-grade borrowers as a reason for tightening
standards and terms on C&I loans over the past three months.
The November survey included a special question to determine which customer groups
had been most affected by the switch to tighter standards and terms on C&I loans over
the past year. Loans to finance mergers and acquisitions were most frequently
mentioned as affected by tighter underwriting standards, and banks also claimed to be
clamping down somewhat more on applications from new customers seeking loan
commitments. Branches and agencies of foreign banks appear to have tightened
somewhat more evenly across all customer groups listed, though they were most likely
to apply more stringent standards and terms to firms in selected industries and
customers seeking M&A financing. Among all the respondents, numerous institutions
noted that they had been especially cautious when lending to industries such as
healthcare, movie theaters, and communications, and at least two banks singled out the
textile, retail, trucking, and asbestos removal industries.
On net, 22 percent of domestic banks reported moderately weaker demand for C&I
loans from large and middle-market firms, while almost 40 percent of foreign branches
and agencies saw weaker demand over the past three months. A smaller net fraction of
domestic banks reported decreased demand from small firms over the same period.
Consistent with the slowdown in the pace of business investment during the third
quarter, domestic banks that reported weaker loan demand most often cited a decrease
in customer demand for credit to finance capital expenditures, followed by a reduced
demand for M&A financing. A decrease in customers' need for M&A financing was
the most common response among foreign respondents that experienced weaker loan
demand.
A special question addressed the extent to which the gradual and sustained increase in
delinquency rates on C&I loans over the past two years had been expected.
Delinquency rates at small domestic banks (banks with less than $20 billion in assets)
rose about in line with expectations, on balance. However, on net, more than
60 percent of large domestic banks and 55 percent of branches and agencies of foreign
banks reported that they were somewhat surprised by the deterioration in the quality of
their C&I loan portfolios over the past two years. Moreover, 10 percent of all domestic

III-A-3
banks indicated that the increase in C&I loan delinquency rates over the past two years
had been much greater than initially anticipated.
Lending to Households
Over the past three months, banks' credit standards for approving residential mortgage
loans were largely unchanged. The deterioration in the demand for home mortgage
loans at banks slowed over the past three months: On net, 33 percent of respondents
reported somewhat weaker demand in the current survey, compared with 40 percent in
the August survey.
Nearly all banks also indicated that their willingness to make consumer installment
loans was unchanged from three months ago. However, a few banks, on net, tightened
credit standards for both credit card and other consumer loans, and more than
10 percent of banks reported charging higher spreads of loan rates over the cost of
funds on these loans as well. On net, 13 percent of domestic banks observed
moderately weaker demand for all types of consumer loans over the past three months.

compares with a deficit of $31.7 billion in July. For July and August combined,
the deficit was $367 billion at an annual rate, $10 billion (annual rate) larger
than in the second quarter.

The value of exports of goods and services in August jumped 3.6 percent, with
increases recorded in all major trade categories. For July and August combined,
the value of exports rose at about the same strong pace recorded in the second
quarter (close to 14 percent at an annual rate), led by increases in exported
machinery (a broad range of products) and industrial supplies (particularly fuels
and chemicals). There were smaller increases in exported agricultural,
consumer, and automotive products and in service receipts.
The value of imports of goods and services rose 0.8 percent in August as
increases in some categories of trade (particularly capital goods) were partly
offset by declines in the value of imported oil (all from price movements),
automotive products and industrial supplies. For July and August combined, the
value of imports rose strongly, but at a slower pace than in the second quarter.
Increases were recorded in all major categories of trade.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. Following two months of small changes, the price of imported oil (BLS)
jumped 14.1 percent in September, driven by strong global demand, concerns

over low inventories, and uncertainty over OPEC production. In late September,
following the Clinton administration's decision to release 30 million barrels of
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the spot price of West Texas
Intermediate fell from its post Gulf War high of $37.20 per barrel to near $30
per barrel. During October, however, oil prices moved higher as the
deteriorating situation in the Middle East, the terrorist attack on the USS Cole,
and Iraqi threats to suspend exports raised the possibility that oil supplies from
the region could be disrupted. An increase in OPEC's production targets of
500,000 b/d had little effect on oil prices as most OPEC countries appear to be
producing at capacity. Spot WTI remained between $33 and $35 per barrel
during the latter half of October, and is currently trading around $33 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. In September, prices of imported non-oil goods declined for
the first time since May, and only the second time since July 1999. The largest
decreases were in industrial supplies (led by a drop in prices of unfinished
metals) and foods. There were small price declines in all other major trade
categories with the exception of imported semiconductors whose prices rose for
the second consecutive month. The price of imported core goods (which
excludes oil, computers, and semiconductors) declined 0.3 percent, also the first
decrease since May. In the third quarter, the price of core goods imports rose
1.5 percent at an annual rate, similar to rates recorded in the past two quarters.
The increase was attributable to industrial supplies and, to a much lesser extent,
to automotive products. The price indexes of imported machinery, consumer
goods, and foods all declined in the third quarter.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports rose moderately in September led by
higher prices for agricultural products (following two months of substantial
declines) and industrial supplies (primarily rising prices for exported fuels). In
the third quarter, prices of total goods exports were about unchanged. Prices of
agricultural exports dropped 12 percent at an annual rate (largely grains and
oilseeds, the prices of which, however, turned up in September). Once again,
prices of exported computers and semiconductors declined. The price of core
goods exports (which excludes computers, semiconductors, and agricultural
products) rose 1.3 percent at an annual rate in Q3, a somewhat smaller rise than
in Q2, with increases recorded in prices of industrial supplies, machinery, and
automotive products.
Note: BLS prices for imports and exports in October were released on
November 8 and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities were very strong in the third
quarter (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Net
purchases of agency bonds (line 4b), corporate bonds (line 4c), and corporate
stocks (line 4d) each proceeded at a record annual pace. Corporate bond
purchases by private foreigners in the third quarter were concentrated in
international financial centers in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, and Japan;
net purchases of agency bonds were distributed more widely, with large net
purchases in the United Kingdom and Japan. Net purchases of U.S. stocks were
very strong in Europe, but also significant in most other areas of the world.
Holdings of Treasury securities continued their moderate fall (line 4a).
Net acquisitions of foreign securities by U.S. investors were just under
$11 billion for the quarter, two-thirds of that accounted for by stock swaps (lines
5 and 5c). After large net purchases of foreign stocks in July, U.S. investors
liquidated a monthly record $10.7 billion in September (line 5b). Both the
purchases and sales of foreign stocks were primarily through Europe.
Foreign official assets held in the United States continued their moderate rise in
the third quarter (line 1). Increases and decreases for individual countries were
all in the moderate range. Russian reserves rose throughout the quarter,
continuing a year-long string of monthly increases that have added a total of
$13 billion to its reserves held in the United States. However, there is little or
no evidence of other oil exporters adding significantly to their reserve holdings
in the United States over the past year. Moderate reserve decreases were
registered for the quarter by Japan, Korea, France, and a few other countries.
Mirroring private foreign investors, official institutions made sizable net
purchases of agency bonds in the third quarter ($14 billion), while reducing their
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. Partial data from FRBNY indicate that in
October foreign official reserves held in the United States decreased by
$19 billion.
Consistent with the slowing in the rate of expansion of domestic bank credit,
there was a moderate capital outflow through banks in September (line 3).

The exchange value of the dollar against a weighted average of other major
currencies has risen 1 1/2 percent on balance since the FOMC meeting on
October 3; the dollar appreciated against European currencies and the Canadian
and Australian dollars, but depreciated slightly against the yen.

Major Currencies
August September October November
Buoyed by the market's focus on the continuing positive differential in growth
rates between the United States and the euro area, the dollar appreciated to
record highs against the euro in the second half of October, surpassing levels
reached prior to the September 22 joint foreign exchange intervention operation
by the G-7. The October 5 decision of the European Central Bank to raise its
refinancing rate 25 basis points to 4 3/4 percent did not give any support to the
common currency. However, the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. GDP
growth data on October 27 was viewed by many in the market as marking a shift
in the exchange rate trend, and the dollar lost a sizable share of its intermeeting
gains versus the euro in the two weeks preceding the publication of this
Greenbook.
The British pound and the Swiss franc
generally followed the movements of the euro during the period. On net, during
the intermeeting period, the dollar appreciated about 2 1/2 percent against the euro
and the Swiss franc, and 3 percent versus sterling. The dollar also appreciated
1% percent against the Canadian dollar amid uncertainty about the upcoming
Canadian parliamentary elections.

IV-9
The dollar depreciated 1 percent against the yen over the intermeeting period
despite disquieting signals about the fragility of Japan's economic recovery,
including the bankruptcy of two life insurance companies and a substantial
decline in industrial production in September. The dollar appreciated 3 percent
against the Australian dollar, reflecting concerns about the economic situation in
Japan, Australia's largest export market, and the size of Australia's current
account deficit.

Net changes in short-term and long-term market interest rates of industrial
countries were relatively small during the period. The spread between U.S. and
euro-area ten-year yields increased 3 basis points. The spread between
three-month rates, however, narrowed 17 basis points, reflecting in part the
ECB's surprise tightening move of October 5. Headline equity indexes in the
euro area and the United Kingdom rose slightly on net over the period amid a
high level of stock price volatility, particularly for technology-sector shares. The
8 percent decline in Canadian share prices was in large part the result of the drop
in the share price of one telecommunications company, but the 3 percent decline
in Japanese share prices was more broad-based.

Renewed concerns over Argentina's external financing situation and its recent
economic and fiscal performance left their imprints on Latin American financial
markets. The sharp increase in the yield spread over Treasuries of Argentine
debt was most notable, but bond prices in Brazil and Mexico were also affected.
Pressure on the Argentine peso, which is pegged to the dollar, was evident in the
sharp movements in non-deliverable forward exchange rates (not shown), with
one-year instruments implying a depreciation risk premium of more than
7 percent. Among unpegged currencies, the dollar appreciated 5% percent
against the Brazilian real, but only about 2 percent versus the Mexican peso.
Equity prices declined in Argentina and Brazil; Mexican share prices, by
contrast, rose.

IV-11
Asset prices in several Asian countries also declined during the intermeeting
period, suggesting a possible decrease in the appetite of international investors
for exposure to emerging markets. A set of country-specific factors, however,
also contributed to the movements in asset prices in the region. For example,
political turmoil continued to weigh on the exchange values of the currencies of
the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan, and sharp declines in the price of
computer chips were seen as a major cause of the decline of equity prices in
Korea.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the September Greenbook suggest that economic growth in
the foreign industrial countries slowed in the third quarter from the strong pace
recorded in the first half of the year. In Japan, economic activity appears to have
expanded at a much slower rate in the third quarter, reinforcing concerns about
the durability of the Japanese recovery. Available indicators suggest that growth
in the euro area also slowed somewhat in the third quarter. Activity in Canada
continued to expand strongly in the third quarter, although at a slower pace than
was recorded in the first half of the year. Third quarter growth in the United
Kingdom was 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.), about the same as the first half of the year.
Although rising oil prices drove broad measures of inflation higher in September
for many of the foreign industrialized countries, core consumer price data show
little evidence of inflation pressures. Twelve-month consumer price inflation in
the euro area rose to 2.8 percent, well above the European Central Bank's
2 percent target ceiling, but core inflation (excluding food and energy prices)
rose only modestly to 1.4 percent. Canadian consumer price inflation
approached the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent inflation
target band, but core inflation declined to only 1.3 percent. In the United
Kingdom, retail price inflation remained below the 2.5 percent target rate, while
in Japan consumer price deflation intensified despite rising oil prices.
In Japan, economic activity appears to have slowed sharply in the third quarter
after expanding rapidly in the first half of the year. Although industrial
production has continued to advance, growth in the services sector has slowed
and activity in construction has declined a bit. The all-industry index, which
includes these components as well as a measure of public sector activity, was up
about 1/2 percent on average in July and August relative to the second quarter
level, following a gain of nearly 2 percent in the second quarter. The dichotomy
between the weak household sector and the improving business sector remains.
Household expenditures and car registrations fell in the third quarter, and
housing starts were down as well. However, both orders and shipments of
machinery rose.
The unemployment rate edged back up to 4.7 percent in September, reflecting
increases in both layoffs and the number of people looking for work. The job-
offers-to-applicants ratio remained steady at 0.62. Deflation in core consumer
goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy)
has intensified despite the increase in energy prices, with prices down 1 percent
in October from a year earlier. Twelve-month inflation in wholesale prices for
domestic goods remains slightly positive, largely reflecting the impact of higher
energy prices, but has dropped a bit since earlier this year.

IV-13
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first nine months of 2000 was
$112 billion (s.a.a.r.), roughly unchanged from the same period last year, as both
exports and imports have increased sharply. The developing Asian countries
continue to account for most of the export gain, while higher oil prices have
contributed significantly to the increase in dollar-denominated imports.

The Bank of Japan's September Tankan survey showed another overall
improvement in business confidence in Japan, once again led by large
manufacturers. The level of the aggregate diffusion index for business
sentiment among firms of all sizes and across all industries crept up a little
further, to -15 from -18 in June. Firms in all categories reported that they expect
conditions to continue improving over the next three months. Profits are
expected to increase 13 percent along with a 3 percent increase in sales,
suggesting that further cost-cutting is occurring. Capital expenditures across all
firms are projected to rise 1.5 percent in FY2000, after falling 9 percent in
FY1999.

IV-14
On October 19 the Japanese Cabinet approved an economic stimulus package of
11 trillion yen; the "real-water" component is estimated to be about 4 trillion
yen, about 0.8 percent of GDP. The funds will be spent on projects related to
information technology, environmental protection, urban infrastructure and
disaster prevention as well as loan programs for small and midsize firms.
Recent data for the euro area suggest that the pace of economic expansion
slowed somewhat in the third quarter. The average volume of retail sales for
July and August was up only 0.4 percent from the second quarter average, after
rising 1.1 percent in the second quarter. Growth in industrial production has
also moderated in most euro-area countries including Germany and Italy.
Exceptions to the slowing growth rate of industrial output include Finland and
Spain, where production has accelerated in recent months.
Forward-looking indicators are also consistent with a more moderate pace of
growth. Consumer confidence in the euro area declined in September and was
unchanged in October, likely in reaction to the recent rise in oil prices and
associated protests in a number of euro-area countries. The German Ifo
Business Climate index fell in September for the fourth consecutive month and
is now down 3 percent from a nine-year high reached in May of this year.
However, the sentiment of euro-area industrial managers edged up in October to
a level only a bit below the record high recorded in June.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area was 9 percent in
September, down nearly a full percentage point from September 1999, largely
due to improved employment growth this year. The national unemployment rate
in France continued to decline in September, while the Italian unemployment
rate reached a seven-year low in the third quarter. In Germany, the
unemployment rate edged down in September and was unchanged in October.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.5 percent (s.a.) in September from August,
bringing the twelve-month rate of inflation to 2.8 percent, well above the
2 percent target ceiling of the European Central Bank. September's large
increase in consumer prices mainly reflected higher energy prices; excluding
food and energy, consumer prices rose a more modest 0.2 percent (s.a.) and were
up only 1.4 percent from September 1999. In Germany, the 12-month rate of
consumer price inflation declined from 2.5 percent in September to 2.3 percent
in October, as energy costs fell from September's high level.

IV-15
On October 5, the European Central Bank raised policy rates 25 basis points,
bringing the minimum bid rate for its refinancing operations to 4.75 percent. In
a press conference, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg stated
that the actions were intended to ensure that "upward pressures on consumer
prices stemming from oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the euro do
not translate into more permanent inflationary tendencies."

In the United Kingdom, the preliminary estimate of real GDP at factor cost
showed growth of 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter. This suggests a
minimal effect from the fuel blockades in September, consistent with the
September and third-quarter retail sales numbers.
Current indicators suggest that growth is continuing, but at a moderate pace.
Industrial production fell 1 percent in September, reflecting weak oil and gas
output due to maintenance stoppages and low energy output due to warm
weather. Over the past twelve months, however, industrial production is up
0.9 percent. Business confidence picked up somewhat in September, but
remains below levels recorded earlier this year. New orders fell again in
September, primarily due to weaker prospects for export orders. Consumer
confidence has also fallen since early this year.
The official claims-based unemployment rate remained at a 25-year low of
3.6 percent in September, and the labor force survey measure of the
unemployment rate remained at 5.3 percent for the three months centered in
July, a record low. Nonetheless, twelve-month growth in average earnings has
moderated in recent months, to 4.1 percent in August. This rate is now below
the 4.5 percent rate that the Bank of England has suggested as compatible with
its inflation target.

IV-17
Producer input prices have risen sharply in recent months, in part reflecting
higher oil prices. The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest rates) remains below the 2-1/2 percent target.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown released the Pre-Budget Report on
November 8, 2000. The fiscal stance is approximately the same as was
forecasted in the March budget, with the fiscal year 2000-2001 budget surplus
estimated at £16.6 billion (nearly 2 percent of 1999 GDP). Responding to
widespread protests against the high price of fuel, excise duties on fuel and
diesel were frozen until April 2002. There will also be a consolidation in vehicle
excise rates which will specifically benefit the hauling industry.

In Canada, indicators suggest economic activity continued to grow at a rapid
pace in the third quarter, although weaker external demand has slowed that pace
somewhat from the first half of the year. Real GDP in July and August, on
average, rose 0.9 percent from the second quarter, a little lower than the pace
recorded over the previous four quarters. Manufacturing production,
particularly in the high-technology and transportation equipment sectors,
continued its impressive growth. Strong retail activity and rising consumer
confidence in the third quarter suggest that consumer spending also retains
considerable strength. However, external demand seems to have softened in the
third quarter, as export activity in the July-August period was scarcely above
second-quarter levels.

Labor market indicators are also consistent with a high, but moderately slowing,
pace of economic growth. Employment rose by 0.2 percent in the third quarter,
after rising 0.9 and 0.4 percent in the first and second quarters. Employment
growth has continued in the current quarter, with October employment rising
0.1 percent from September. However, the unemployment rate has not fallen
this year, as labor force participation rates have risen alongside employment.
Higher energy prices pushed the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation
to 2.7 percent in September, near the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent
to 3 percent target range. However, the twelve-month core rate of inflation

IV-19
(which excludes food and energy prices) was up only 1.3 percent in September,
down from 1.5 percent in August. Wage increases have accelerated recently,
with average hourly earnings rising 3.7 percent in the 12 months ending in
October, up from growth of close to 3 percent in the first half of the year.
In his mid-year "Economic and Fiscal Update", Finance Minister Paul Martin
detailed plans to increase the amount of tax cuts to C$100 billion (11 percent of
1999 GDP) over five years from the C$58 billion announced in the February
budget. The new tax cuts include a further increase in the amount of capital
gains excluded from taxation and additional reductions in personal and
corporate income tax rates. Finance Minister Martin also announced plans for
C$50 billion (6 percent of 1999 GDP) in new spending over five years, up from
C$28 billion in the February budget. The plan also budgets an additional
C$10 billion in debt reduction (1 percent of 1999 GDP) for the current fiscal
year which, when combined with existing debt reduction plans, is projected to
lower the debt to GDP ratio from 59 percent to 40 percent by 2005.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in the major developing countries generally slowed during the
third quarter from the very rapid rates that prevailed earlier this year. Growth
slowed in Mexico and appears to have slowed in Brazil. Argentina took center
stage in October, as the languishing economy and political stresses fueled
concerns about the country's ability to service its debts. There were also signs
that the pace of expansion moderated in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Political instability in several ASEAN countries continue to be a cause for
concern about the outlook for that region, notwithstanding indications that these
economies continue to expand. China, in contrast, posted strong growth in the
third quarter, with activity being boosted by government spending.
Inflationary pressures have grown in several countries, but generally, inflation
has been remarkably subdued in the face of high fuel prices. Inflation has fallen
in Mexico and Brazil, and deflationary pressures persist in Argentina.
With respect to external performance, the Mexican trade deficit narrowed as
exports strengthened due to high oil prices and the strong U.S. economy. High
oil prices also helped boost Argentina's trade balance. Export growth continued
to be strong in Greater China and the ASEAN countries.
In Argentina, conditions have worsened since the last Greenbook. After an
uptick in July, industrial production fell in August and September, leading to the
second consecutive quarterly decline. Monthly inflation turned positive in
October, but consumer prices are still 1/2 percent below their level of a year ago.
Other recent indicators have been mixed, and consumer confidence remains low.
Export growth continues to be the one consistently positive economic factor,
driven partially by strong oil exports, resulting in another trade surplus in
August.
Political uncertainty has also increased recently, as the resignation of
Argentina's vice president in protest over a reshuffling of the cabinet in early
October led to questions about the stability of the Alliance government. While
the Alliance government appears to be holding together for now, many are
concerned about the ability of the government to pass key pieces of legislation,
including the 2001 budget now being debated in the Argentine congress. These
concerns, together with the weak economy, have increased investors' skepticism
about the ability of Argentina to finance its large external debt and fiscal deficit.
The EMBI+ Argentina spread over U.S. Treasuries has soared about 250 basis
points to over 900 basis points since late September, domestic 30-day deposit
rates in pesos have risen 500 basis points to 13.5 percent, and the 1-day
interbank rate has touched levels not seen in 7 years.

In Mexico, growth appears to be moderating to a more sustainable rate.
Consistent with the slowing in the pace of activity, average industrial production
for July and August (s.a.) was only a touch above the second-quarter level. The
unemployment rate also rose slightly to 2.3 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter.
The continued generally favorable external environment, including high oil
prices and a robust U.S. economy, led to export growth outpacing import
growth, resulting in a narrowing of the trade deficit from $10 billion (a.r.) in the
second quarter to $8 billion in the third quarter.
Inflation continued to decline, with consumer prices rising by less than 9 percent
in September on a twelve-month basis, making it very likely that the
government's target of 10 percent for year-end inflation will be achieved. The
Bank of Mexico (BOM) announced ambitious targets for inflation for the
coming years, with the goal of reducing inflation to 6.5 percent next year,
4.5 percent in 2002, and 3 percent in 2003. In order to bring inflationary
expectations for 2001 closer in line to its target, the BOM undertook another
round of monetary policy tightening in mid-October by increasing its "corto."
Subsequently, interest rates have risen about 2 percentage points.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook suggest a slowing in economic
activity over the third quarter. Industrial production declined in August and
September. High oil prices and a slowdown in export growth led to a
continuation of monthly trade deficits. Inflation declined sharply in September
and October, after having been driven up in July and August by increases in
domestic energy prices and other government-controlled prices.
Despite the slowdown in inflation, the central bank's monetary policy committee
held the overnight rate steady at 16.5 percent at its October meeting, citing its
concern that high fuel prices will increase inflationary pressures. Wage
pressures have been on the rise in recent weeks, seen, in part, in a 12 percent pay
increase awarded to judiciary workers in October. Left wing parties posted gains
in local elections, although commentators are divided as to whether these gains
signal a fall in support for the reform process. Fiscal performance continued to
be good, with Brazil meeting its IMF program fiscal target in September by a
wide margin.
The real and other Brazilian asset prices have come under some downward
pressures since mid-October, fueled by concerns about developments in
Argentina. In response to the weakening of the real, Brazilian authorities have
been rolling over all of the maturing dollar-indexed debt. This marks a

IV-26
departure from the practice in recent months of allowing the stock to decline
slightly in dollar terms. The authorities sold only two-thirds of the five-year
dollar-indexed debt that it offered at two auctions in late October. This result
prompted the central bank to reduce maturities at subsequent auctions of
dollar-indexed debt to two years.

Few economic data have filtered out of Venezuela since the last Greenbook.
Trade figures for the second quarter reflect the sustained strength in oil exports,
which contributed to a $12.6 billion (s.a.) current account balance. Much of this
revenue is being channeled into government spending. Twelve-month inflation
fell in October to 15 percent, marking a continuation of the downward trend in
inflation in recent years.
In early November, the National Assembly approved the "Enabling Law," which
gives President Chavez decree power for a year to enact laws affecting a broad
range of areas from the oil sector to banks. Enabling laws are not unusual for
Venezuela, but the powers granted in this law are viewed as unprecedented.

In Korea, recent activity data have been mixed. The monthly pattern of
industrial production has been distorted because the Thanksgiving holiday fell at
the beginning of September this year. For the third quarter as a whole, industrial
production recorded a substantial increase. However, measures of consumer and
business sentiment have deteriorated in recent months. The unemployment rate
has recorded little change since the second quarter, after declining substantially
last year and earlier this year. The consumer price inflation rate moved up
sharply in September. This result prompted the Bank of Korea in early October
to raise its key money market intervention rate by 25 basis points to
5.25 percent, the first such increase since February.
The government has recently indicated that it will ask the legislature for an
additional 40 trillion won (8 percent of GDP) to complete financial sector
restructuring. However, financial sector restructuring is being held up by
uncertainties arising from continuing delays in corporate restructuring. Officials
have promised that the (now largely government owned or controlled) banking
sector will cut off funds by the end of November to nonviable companies
currently under bank workout agreements. Market participants are viewing this
promised action as a key test of the government's resolve to carry through on the
restructuring process.

The economic expansion appears to have continued in most of the ASEAN
region during the third quarter. Export growth continued to be the driving force,
although private consumption also picked up in Singapore and Malaysia. High
oil prices and the depreciation of regional currencies have led to a rise in
consumer price inflation.
The biggest concern for the region is the political turmoil that has embroiled
several countries. Philippine President Estrada is facing calls for his resignation
due to his alleged involvement in a gambling scandal, and Indonesian President
Wahid is under investigation for alleged involvement in two scandals. In
Thailand, the upcoming national elections in January have investors uncertain
about the future course of the economic recovery and reform efforts, as a
populist party is posing a strong challenge to the ruling party.

In China, economic activity picked up significantly, with real GDP rising
11 percent in the third quarter, boosted by an increase in state-sector investment
and some strengthening in private consumption (especially in urban areas).
Despite the pickup in activity, inflation remained very low; consumer prices
were flat in September compared with the same month a year ago. Exports
continued to register strong growth, although the rate of expansion of exports
has slowed relative to earlier in the year. Imports fell slightly (s.a.) in
September, but were up sharply on average in the third quarter due to stronger
domestic demand and rising oil prices. In late September, President Clinton
signed into law a bill granting China Permanent Normal Trading Relations
status. However, disputes over a number of technical details have arisen during
the final stages of multilateral talks and threaten to delay China's entry into the
WTO until next year.
In Hong Kong, data releases since the last Greenbook have painted a mixed
picture, but on balance suggest some sluggishness in economic activity in the
third quarter. Retail sales volume was down roughly 5 percent (s.a.) over the
July-August period, relative to the second quarter. The unemployment rate
continued to ease only slowly, edging down to 4.8 percent (s.a.) in the
July-September period. Deflationary pressures remain, with the twelve-month
rate of decline in consumer prices moderating only a touch in September. On a
more positive note, exports jumped about 5 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter.
Imports, however, rose even faster, resulting in a sharp increase in the trade
deficit.

In Taiwan, there are signs that economic activity may be slowing amid
heightened political uncertainties. Growth in industrial production moderated to
1.5 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter, as robust expansion in the information
technology and electronics sectors was partly offset by a slowdown in some
traditional industries. Exports rose to record levels in October, although the
pace of expansion has slowed since earlier in the year. Inflation remained low;
consumer prices in October were only 1 percent above their year-earlier level.
Premier Tang Fei resigned unexpectedly in early October, worsening a crisis of
confidence in Taiwan's new government.
