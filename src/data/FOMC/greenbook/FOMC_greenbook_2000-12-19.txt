Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity continued to advance at a relatively subdued pace into the
fourth quarter. Gains in payroll employment have moderated considerably since
midyear, and the further rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance
suggests that the softening in the labor market may have continued in recent
weeks. Factory output has slowed sharply over the past few months, in part
reflecting efforts to correct inventory overhangs that have developed in the
motor vehicle sector. Consumer spending and business purchases of equipment
and software have slowed from the extraordinary gains early this year. Core
inflation has edged up over the past year.
Labor Market Developments
Private-sector hiring was moderate in November, but the slowdown in recent
months has done little to alleviate pressures in what has remained an
exceptionally tight labor market. There are signs, however, of further easing of
labor demand; initial claims for unemployment insurance have been rising, and
various surveys show that firms' and households' evaluations of labor market
conditions have deteriorated.
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 148,000 in November and was up an
average of about 110,000 per month in October and November. This recent
pace of growth represents a slight moderation from the third quarter's average
monthly gain of about 130,000 and a significant slowdown from the first-half
pace of about 185,000 per month.1 In November, the slowdown was evident in
most industries, aside from the relatively brisk holiday-season hiring in retail
trade.2 Construction employment fell somewhat, partly as a result of
unfavorable weather in the South and Northwest. Payrolls were essentially
unchanged in manufacturing, but the figure masks the extent of weakness in this
sector: The numerous plant shutdowns in the auto industry all fell outside the
survey reference period, and the factory workweek fell 0.3 hour, to its lowest
level since 1992 (excepting a sharp, weather-induced drop in January 1996).
Overall, the workweek for production or nonsupervisory workers on private
nonfarm payrolls edged down to 34.3 hours per week in November. Together
with the moderate gains in employment, the average level of production worker
1. With this release, the BLS introduced new seasonal factors for data derived from the
establishment survey. The new seasonal factors were applied to data for September, October,
and November; data for months before September will not be revised to incorporate the new
factors until next spring. However, unpublished information from the BLS suggests that the
break in the seasonal factors does not significantly affect published September changes.
2. Because of the proximity of the November reference week to Thanksgiving, seasonal
hiring by retailers may have occurred sufficiently early to have been captured in the November
survey rather than the December survey.

hours in October and November stood 1-1/2 percent (at an annual rate) above
the third-quarter average; aggregate hours have been essentially unchanged, on
balance, since last April.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in
November, its average reading so far this year. The labor force participation
rate held steady at 67.0 percent.
Other indicators of labor market conditions reinforce the impression that the
growth of labor demand has eased and, indeed, suggest that more weakening is
in store. The four-week moving average of initial claims and the level of
insured unemployment have increased significantly from the lows they reached
last spring; their new, higher levels are consistent with a further decline in net
job growth. Consistent with the rise in unemployment claims, the Conference
Board's survey of households shows that the fraction of respondents who
believe that jobs are currently plentiful has fallen from its recent high. In
addition, measures of hiring strength from the Manpower and the National
Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) surveys have leveled off or
declined, and respondents to both the Michigan and Conference Board
consumer surveys have become less optimistic about job prospects in the
coming months; December's decline in employment expectations in the
Michigan survey was particularly sharp. Despite these signs of easing,
employers responding to the NFIB survey continue to report that they are
finding it difficult to hire workers. The NFIB measure of "positions hard to fill"
in November returned to its record high.

report also indicated that productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose
at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2000. Over the four
quarters ended 2000:Q3, output per hour in this sector was up 4.8 percent, a
percentage point more than the gain over the four quarters ended 1999:Q3.
Motor Vehicles
After having dropped 1 million units at an annual rate in October, sales of light
vehicles fell 350,000 units in November. So far this quarter, sales have
averaged 16.6 million units (annual rate), a marked stepdown from the pace
during the spring and summer months. Some of this decline likely stems from
less generous incentive programs; current estimates of average planned
incentives per vehicle in the fourth quarter point to a decline of about $440 from
the third-quarter peak of $1,790. Nonetheless, the level of incentives remains
high by historical standards, and the softening in sales probably also reflects the
downshift in employment growth and consumer sentiment. Indeed, consumer
attitudes toward vehicle purchases have become a bit more subdued: In the
latest Conference Board survey, the fraction of respondents planning to
purchase a new vehicle within the next six months dropped back noticeably.
The assessment of buying conditions for vehicles in the Michigan survey ticked
down in early December but remains in the range recorded over the past year.
The recent slackening in sales has hit the Big Three automakers the hardest;
their combined market share fell to a record low of 64 percent in November.
The combination of weakening sales and loss of market share has led to
significant inventory overhangs at the Big Three, which have been slow to cut

production. To begin to address these imbalances, the Big Three temporarily
shut down several assembly plants in November, and total motor vehicle
production dropped 300,000 units (annual rate), to 11.9 million units. In spite of
these cutbacks, dealer stocks remained excessively high, with days' supply of
light trucks at an elevated 82 days at the end of November. The overall days'
supply of autos stood at a seemingly comfortable level of 59 days. However,
because this figure is held down by the low days' supply of autos at the
transplants, it masks serious inventory problems for the Big Three.
Production appears likely to remain depressed going forward. Automakers'
assembly plans for December include additional shutdowns at all the Big Three
firms. Although schedules currently call for an assembly rate of 12.1 million
units in December, further production cuts apparently are under consideration.
Similarly, although initial production schedules for the first quarter of next year
average 12.1 million units, Ward's Communications has reported that it expects
Chrysler to reduce its first-quarter assembly plans in the next week or two.
Moreover, industry analysts have suggested that, as has been done in the past,
automakers may extend the normal holiday shutdowns in order to achieve
further reductions in inventories. Indeed, cutbacks at GM seem almost
inevitable given the very high days' supply of light trucks (108 days) at GM.
Industrial Production
The drop in motor vehicle assemblies and the widespread reduction in factory
hours in November suggest that manufacturing IP contracted in November.3
The softness in production seems broadly consistent with other indicators of
near-term manufacturing activity. Real adjusted durable goods orders fell
2.6 percent in October, with declines spread among high-tech and other goods.
In the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) survey of
manufacturers, more respondents have indicated that orders are declining than
have indicated that orders are expanding since July.
Within high-tech industries, the November hours data suggest a noticeable
slowdown in the growth rate of computer production. Moreover, there are clear
signs that the dramatic gains in the semiconductor industry may be nearing an
end: The Semiconductor Industry Association survey of purchaser's
procurement plans reports that target inventory holdings have been declining for
the last three months and that actual inventories remain well above the target
level; moreover, delivery lead times have been sliding over the same period,
suggesting an easing in market pressures.
3. We estimate from the input-output tables that the total contribution of changes in motor
vehicle assemblies to IP (including the indirect effects on downstream industries such as original
motor vehicle equipment parts, stampings, iron and steel, flat glass, and textiles) is twice the
magnitude of the direct contribution. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the exact
timing of these effects.

Before the slowing in production in recent months, the factory operating rate
had been hovering around the long-term average of 81.6 percent. Industries
with noteworthy strains on productive facilities included petroleum products,
construction supplies, and semiconductors-although utilization in the latter
industry has dropped since June as production gains have downshifted. Looking
forward, the NAPM's semiannual survey conducted in November reported that
more manufacturers plan to decrease than to increase their capital expenditures
in 2001. This diffusion index, which we have found to be a good indicator of
capital spending by manufacturers, suggests that aggregate manufacturing
investment in 2001 will be essentially flat. However, that overall figure
includes an expected increase in capital spending in the semiconductor industry
that, based on reports from our contacts in the industry, we estimate will be
about 20 percent (down from an estimated 70 percent gain this year). We
estimate that investment expenditures by manufacturers outside the
semiconductor industry will decline 1-1/2 percent to 2 percent next year.
Consumer Spending
The spending data in hand point to a noticeable deceleration in real consumer
expenditures in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, the retrenchment in
consumer sentiment, slower hiring, and the decline in the stock market suggest a
continuation of this more moderate pace of expansion.

Although the most dramatic weakening has been in sales of light vehicles, the
gains in spending on other consumer goods appear to have slowed in recent
months as well. Nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which
excludes automotive dealers and building material and supply outlets, increased
0.2 percent in both October and November after having increased 0.6 percent
per month during the previous three months. Although spending at apparel
outlets continued to move up in November, sales at general merchandisers are
estimated to have edged down, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Weaker outlays
at establishments selling "other" durable goods and slower spending at those
selling "other" nondurables also have contributed importantly to the moderation
in nominal spending in the last two months. Factoring in our estimates for
prices in November, we think that the level of real spending on consumer goods
outside of motor vehicles in October and November was 3 percent above the
third-quarter average (annual rate). Spending on these goods rose at a
5-1/4 percent annual rate last quarter.
Real outlays on services increased 0.3 percent in October. November data for
outlays on services are not yet available, but indicators used by the BEA to
construct its estimate of two particularly volatile components are sending mixed
signals. The drop in the volume of trading on the major stock exchanges last
month suggests a decline in PCE brokerage charges and investment counseling.
In contrast, a swing from warmer-than-average weather in October to cooler-
than-average weather in November points to a considerable increase in outlays
on energy services.
The Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) index of consumer sentiment
plunged in early December to its lowest level since October 1998, when concern
about the impact on the domestic economy of economic turmoil abroad reached
its peak.5 If this level were to hold through the final reading, December's
drop-the fourth largest since monthly surveys began in 1978-would signal a
sharp reversal of consumer attitudes. Indeed, the diffusion index of employment
conditions, which we have found useful as an indicator of consumption,
registered an even more sizable deterioration in December than the overall
index. Taking a longer-term perspective, both the SRC index and the
Conference Board (CB) index of consumer confidence have declined noticeably
from the record highs recorded in January. After standardizing the two indexes
to account for the larger historical volatility of the CB index, both measures
were about 1-1/2 standard deviations above their long-run historical averages
through November. The further sharp drop in the SRC index in early December
left that index 0.7 standard deviation above its long-term average.
5. Although the preliminary report was released earlier in the month than usual, it is based
on the same number of responses that are typically available.

All the major stock market indexes have fallen further since the November
Greenbook. Assuming that stock prices remain near their current levels, we
expect that the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income will
move down noticeably in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, abstracting from
monthly swings in the headline figures attributable to special farm subsidy
payments in the third quarter, real personal income has continued to rise at close
to an annual rate of 3 percent, the same pace that has prevailed since the spring
of 1999.6 The latest labor market report is consistent with personal income in
November receiving a moderate lift from an increase in private wages and
salaries.
Housing Markets
Housing activity appeared to level off early this fall. Single-family starts were
unchanged at an annual rate of 1.23 million units in October-about the level
that has prevailed since June. This flat pattern probably reflects the balance
between the positive effect on demand of declining mortgage rates and the
negative influences of declining equity prices and slower gains in employment.
Sales of new homes declined 2.6 percent in October, to an annual rate of
928,000 units, but this level was still 2-1/2 percent above the third-quarter pace.
More broadly, new home sales have moved sideways since early last year in a
range between 850,000 and 950,000 units. Existing home sales fell 3.9 percent
in October, to an annual rate of 4.96 million units. Relative to the comparable
year-earlier period, the average level of existing home sales through October of
this year is down a modest 4-1/4 percent.
House prices continued to increase briskly in the third quarter. The repeat-sales
price of existing homes rose at a year-over-year rate of 7.3 percent in the third
quarter. Except for a fractionally higher figure in the second quarter, that
increase is the most rapid rise recorded since early 1987. Regional data for the
repeat-sales price index for existing homes show that price increases in recent
quarters have been especially rapid in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and
Pacific regions. These areas have relatively high concentrations of high-tech
and financial industries, and high salaries and (at least until recently) lucrative
stock options likely have helped stimulate housing demand.
For new homes, the year-over-year rate of increase in the constant-quality price
dropped back from 5-3/4 percent in the second quarter to 4 percent in the third
quarter, which is toward the lower end of the elevated range of increases that
has prevailed since early last year. In October, the average new home price
increased 9 percent from a year earlier, and the median price increased
6. Special farm subsidy payments boosted the change in personal income $61 billion in
September and reduced it $57 billion in October.

9.3 percent. However, these rapid increases were driven in part by a rise in the
share of new homes sold in the Northeast region, where house prices are
relatively high; sales in October jumped 38 percent in the Northeast but declined
moderately in the three other regions of the country.
More timely indicators of housing demand were mixed in November and
December. The index of builders' ratings of new home sales continued to rise in
November, but it has retraced only about one-fourth of its decline from the high
in mid-1999. The Michigan Survey's measure of consumer attitudes toward
homebuying, which turned up noticeably in November in response to falling
mortgage rates, retraced most of that increase in early December.
In the multifamily sector, starts edged up in October to an annual rate of
305,000 units, a pace that equals the average for the third quarter but is
17 percent below the elevated level in the first half of this year. Nevertheless,
conditions in the multifamily sector remain conducive to additional
construction. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units was roughly
unchanged in the second and third quarters from the relatively low year-earlier
level.
Business Investment
Equipment and software. The substantial slowdown in business expenditures
on equipment and software last quarter was relatively widespread. Overall, real
outlays rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the third quarter, after having
risen at a pace of nearly 20 percent in the first half of the year. Among the
components, growth in real spending on high-tech equipment and software
dropped back from an average annual rate of 33 percent in the first half of the
year to less than 20 percent in the third quarter, with outlays for communications
equipment particularly soft. Non-high-tech spending, which rose at around a
pace of 10 percent in the first half, fell 4 percent (annual rate) in the third
quarter.
The slowing in investment expenditures under way is consistent with
deteriorating fundamentals. Both business output and real cash flow have
decelerated over the past year. Moreover, the financial environment has become
less hospitable: Increasingly stringent bank lending standards have made
borrowing more difficult, while the cost of equity finance has risen along with
declining stock prices. The telecommunications industry has been hit especially
hard in the face of lower stock prices and higher risk premiums on its debt
issuance. Further, while the technology-driven decline in computer prices has
continued, the rate of descent moderated during the first three quarters of this

year, in part because of capacity pressures in the semiconductor industry that
boosted input costs to computer manufacturers.
Incoming data suggest that real spending on equipment and software will post
another moderate gain in the fourth quarter. In October, nominal shipments of
computing and office equipment and of communications equipment stood about
3-1/4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, above their third-quarter averages.
Outside the high-tech area, shipments turned up in October, with notable gains
in special industrial machinery, a category that includes textile, paper, printing,
and food products machinery. Moreover, backlogs for non-high-tech equipment
remained elevated. On the downside, business conditions in the commercial
truck sector have continued to deteriorate this quarter. Sales of medium and
heavy trucks fell almost 6 percent in October, to an annual rate of 500,000 units.
Net new orders for medium and heavy trucks (classes 5 though 8) decreased to
about 21,000 units in November (monthly rate), suggesting that sales may
weaken further in the near-term.
Nonresidential construction. In contrast to recent trends in outlays on
equipment and software, spending on nonresidential construction continued to
rise briskly in October, with nominal outlays for private buildings increasing
1-1/2 percent following a 2-3/4 percent rise in the third quarter. Except for
April and June, nonresidential construction has risen in every month this year,
and the level of construction in October was up 19-1/2 percent from the year-
earlier level. All the major subcategories show substantial year-over-year gains
in activity.
Spending for construction of office buildings fell 3 percent in October. The
decline followed a large increase in September, however, and the level of
spending in October remained slightly above its third-quarter average. The pace
of office construction was 15-1/2 percent ahead of the year-earlier level, and
market conditions appear to favor continued growth. The rate of increase in
property values continued to pick up in the third quarter, and rents accelerated to
a pace only slightly below the high in early 1998. The vacancy rate for office
properties in downtown locations edged down 0.1 percentage point, to
6.2 percent, in the third quarter, which is the lowest level on record. The
downtown vacancy rate is off considerably from 8.7 percent in the third quarter
of last year. Available space in suburban office buildings declined
0.3 percentage point in the third quarter, to 8.6 percent, down from 10.1 percent
in the corresponding period last year.
Construction spending for commercial structures (which include retail space and
warehouses) jumped 5 percent in October. The rate of change in property
values for retail space was unchanged in the third quarter, and the growth rate

for rents picked up a bit further. Property values for warehouses continued to
accelerate, and the rate of increase in warehouse rents was about flat.
Outlays for industrial buildings were up 5-1/4 percent in October, continuing the
sizable increases in expenditures that have generally prevailed since October of
last year. Over that twelve-month period, industrial construction more than
retraced the sharp decline that occurred in 1998. The vacancy rate for industrial
properties edged down 0.1 percentage point in the third quarter, to 7.7 percent;
since late 1998, this vacancy rate has fluctuated between 7 percent and just over
8 percent.
Business Inventories
The book value of inventories in manufacturing rose at an annual rate of
$36 billion in October following stockbuilding at a $27 billion pace in the third
quarter. October's gain was led by large increases in stocks at manufacturers of
industrial and electrical machinery. The inventory-shipments ratio for
manufacturing edged up to 1.3 months in October, the highest level in more than
a year. Increases in inventory-shipments ratios were widespread among
manufacturers of durable goods; in particular, the ratios for both primary and
fabricated metals rose from already high levels. Among producers of
nondurables, inventory-shipments ratios in the chemicals, textiles, and rubber
and plastics industries remained high.
The book value of wholesale inventories, excluding stocks held by auto dealers,
rose at an annual rate of $12 billion in October, only a bit below the $16 billion
pace of the third quarter. Large increases in inventories at wholesalers of
electrical goods were matched by the combined inventory liquidations at
wholesalers of machinery and farm products. Among other distributors, a small
amount of stockbuilding was reported. The October inventory-sales ratio for the
wholesale sector excluding motor vehicles was 1.28 months, the same as the
third-quarter average and at the top of the range that has prevailed over the past
year-albeit well off the peaks of 1998. The inventory-sales ratios for
distributors of electrical goods, metals and minerals, and paper products were at
their highest levels in more than a year.
Although the overhang in motor vehicle inventories had begun to emerge by the
end of the third quarter, no problems were apparent at other retailers. The book
value of retail inventories, excluding stocks held by auto dealers, increased at an
annual rate of only $0.6 billion in September. The inventory-sales ratio edged
down to 1.32 months, at the bottom of the range that has prevailed this year.

Government Expenditures
Federal government. The federal government's unified surplus continues to
rise. For the twelve months ended in October, the unified surplus reached
$252 billion, up substantially from the $131 billion surplus of a year earlier. For
the month of October, the deficit was $11 billion, compared with $26 billion last
October.
October receipts were 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Withheld income
and payroll taxes were 14 percent higher, partly because there was an additional
business day in the month this year. "Other" receipts fell $1 billion, or
5 percent, reflecting the Federal Reserve's decision to rebuild its surplus by
temporarily stopping its weekly payment to the Treasury.
October outlays fell slightly, relative to last year, because of shifts in payments
from October to September this year. After adjusting for these payment shifts
and for other major financial transactions, outlays rose $6 billion, a 4 percent
increase over last year. Although some of these outlays were funded through a
series of continuing resolutions, rather than new 2001 appropriations bills, the
delays in appropriation bills do not appear to have disrupted spending.
Congress has completed work on nine of the thirteen appropriations bills, and,
according to press reports, the White House and congressional leaders have
agreed to an outline for completing the remaining four bills. If implemented,
this agreement would increase nominal discretionary spending by roughly
5 percent over last year. In addition, negotiations continue over a proposal to
increase Medicare spending by approximately $30 billion over five years.
State and local governments. Indicators of spending by state and local
governments were mixed early in the fourth quarter. Employment fell 41,000 in
November following a small rise in October. Finding adequate staff appears to
be a problem at both state and local education establishments, and anecdotal
reports suggest that hiring of poll workers was weaker than in previous
presidential elections.
While real spending on construction projects by state and local governments
dipped in October, the level of real construction outlays in October remained
above the third-quarter pace. Among the categories of construction outlays,
highway construction fell notably in October while most other types of
construction rose. In particular, school construction has trended up this year,
reaching its highest level on record. Anecdotal reports indicate that the increase
reflects rising public school enrollment along with widening emphasis on
smaller class sizes, renovation and replacement of aging facilities, and efforts by

Prices
The consumer price index rose a modest 0.2 percent in October and was up
3.4 percent over the past twelve months, nearly 1 percentage point more than
during the preceding twelve months. The acceleration in energy prices
accounted for more than half the pickup over the past year, but faster increases
in core prices also made a sizable contribution. Core prices rose 0.2 percent in
October and were up 2.5 percent over the past twelve months. On a current-
methods basis, the twelve-month change in the core CPI has moved up
0.4 percentage point over the past year; excluding tobacco as well, the pickup
over the past twelve months was 0.7 percentage point.
The CPI for core commodities has decelerated considerably over the past year,
but this step-down is due mainly to the sharp deceleration in tobacco prices,
which had surged in late 1998. Outside of tobacco, the inflation rate for
commodities was little changed over the past twelve months. The CPI for non-
energy services has risen 3.5 percent over the past twelve months, substantially
faster than over the previous twelve-month period.7 Faster rates of inflation in
medical services, shelter, and a range of other items have contributed to this
acceleration.
Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in October and were up 1.7 percent over the
past twelve months. The rate of increase in these prices was just 0.1 percentage
point higher than a year ago, noticeably less than the 0.4 percentage point
acceleration in the core CPI on a current-methods basis. As we have mentioned
previously, patterns of acceleration in these indexes can differ considerably,
reflecting differences in the coverage and methodology used for the two price
measures. Among these differences, the broader scope of the PCE index, which
includes some items that are not in the CPI, has been an important source of the
recent deviation in the two indexes. Some of these "out-of-scope" items in PCE
do not have market prices, and the BEA imputes prices for these products. Over
the past year, an index of nonmarket prices (constructed by the staff) has
decelerated-holding down the acceleration in core PCE prices-while an index
of market-based core PCE prices has accelerated 1/4 percentage point. Another
sizable chunk of the differential acceleration in the two core indexes stems from
differences in the source data used to measure prices of medical care services.
Specifically, the BEA uses PPIs for physician services and hospitals operated
7. As we reported previously, the BLS recently corrected a programming error that affected
tenants' rents and owners' equivalent rent. Although the error affected numbers for both 1999
and 2000, the BLS corrected figures only for 2000. Because of this discontinuity, the amount of
acceleration in non-energy service prices over the past year is overstated in the published figures
by about 0.2 percentage point.

for profit in constructing the PCE price index. Over the past year, these PPIs
together showed little net change-contributing to the relatively flat pattern of
core PCE inflation-while the corresponding CPI accelerated considerably8
Prices of business equipment and software also have accelerated over the past
year, reflecting a pickup in the rate of price change for a range of capital goods.
Although the PPI for capital equipment was unchanged in October, the NIPA
price index for equipment and software-which relies heavily on PPIs as source
data-increased at an average annual rate of about 1 percent over the first three
quarters of this year, compared with a decline of 2-1/4 percent last year.
Computer and software prices are two important contributors to this pattern.
Computer prices have fallen at an average annual rate of just 11-1/4 percent
over the first three quarters of this year, compared with a decline of 20 percent
over 1999. Strong demand for semiconductor inputs could not be fully met with
available capacity, leading to a moderation in the pace of price decline for these
key components of computers and, ultimately, for computers themselves. With
an apparent softening in the demand for tech products, the pressure on computer
prices appears likely to ease.
The NIPA price index for software jumped 9-1/4 percent at an annual rate over
the first three quarters of this year, after declining an average of 1 percent a year
over the previous five years. While the BEA does not publish any detail on
software, our review of the source data used by the BEA, combined with our
understanding of the BEA's methodology, suggests that the jump in software
prices mainly reflected a surge in the price of prepackaged software. In
addition, a more moderate pickup in the price of own-account software appears
to be related to more rapid increases in compensation costs of employees
involved in software production.9
The firming of investment prices has contributed to a pickup in rates of increase
in the broader price measures in the national accounts. Over the four quarters
8. Specifically, the CPI for medical care services accelerated 1.5 percentage points over the
past year. In contrast, the physician services PPI decelerated 1 percentage point over the period,
and the hospital PPI accelerated just 0.7 percentage point.
9. The BEA software measure includes three types of software: prepackaged software
bought off the shelf, custom software developed by employees outside a firm, and own-account
software developed by a firm's own employees. To estimate prices of prepackaged software for
recent quarters, the BEA uses a PPI index for applications software, and this PPI has accelerated
sharply this year. For prices of own-account software, the BEA's quarterly indicators are the
ECI for compensation for all private industry workers and an index of intermediate input costs.
This ECI rose at an average annual rate of 4.8 percent over the first three quarters of this year,
compared with an increase of 3.4 percent in 1999. The price index for custom software is a
weighted average of the price indexes for own-account and prepackaged software (with a
75 percent weight on the own-account category), and its price has risen in line with increases for
prepackaged and own-account software.

ended in 2000:Q3, the chain-weighted price index for gross domestic purchases
increased 2-1/2 percent, about 3/4 percentage point faster than in the preceding
four-quarter period.
At earlier stages of processing, prices have changed little, on balance, since the
time of the last Greenbook. Although the petroleum subcomponent of the
Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials was down noticeably over
that period, the overall index has increased 0.7 percent; higher prices were
registered for some metals, textiles, and some forest products.
After having ticked up in October, near-term inflation expectations have moved
back down. The median response to the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead
inflation expectations was 2.9 percent in November and early December, back
in line with its pace in the first three quarters of the year. Longer-term
expectations-as measured by the five-to-ten-year median expectation-edged
up to 3.1 percent in this month's preliminary survey, a little above the pace that
prevailed earlier this year.
Energy price developments. Although the CPI for energy was up only a touch
in October, the rise in energy prices since midyear has been rapid. Most
notably, natural gas prices have soared, with spot prices of natural gas at a
record high in early December and more than triple their levels of a year ago.
We estimate that consumer prices for gas this quarter will be up about
30 percent from the fourth quarter of 1999.
Relative to last year, the increase in natural gas demand stems from the rapid
pace of economic activity seen through the first half of the year and the trend
among electric utilities toward gas-fired generators. Recent jumps in natural gas
prices reflect both lean inventories and the expectation that this winter will be
colder than the unusually warm winters of the past two years. As of December
1, inventories of natural gas were about 14 percent below the seasonal norm.
This inventory shortfall reflects strong growth in gas demand in the face of little
change in domestic production. Although drilling activity has increased
enormously with higher prices, most of the resulting new gas supplies will not
become available until winter is past.
The market for heating oil looks similar to that for natural gas: Inventories are
about 14 percent below the normal seasonal range, and refiners' markups on
heating oil are about 7¢ to 10¢ per gallon above the seasonal norm. Production
of heating oil has changed little from last year, while demand has jumped
markedly--especially over the past three months. Some of the increase in
demand probably stems from recent spells of cold weather, and some may
reflect precautionary inventory-building at the retail level. Nonetheless,
wholesale inventories of heating oil in the East at the end of November were

one-third below the level that has prevailed in recent years-a shortfall of about
eleven days of that region's wintertime consumption. In the event of a severe
cold snap, this lean supply of inventories could be supplemented-but only
briefly-by a release from the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve: The reserve
holds a stock of heating oil amounting to only one day of East Coast wintertime
consumption.
In contrast to the situations in the natural gas and heating oil markets, gasoline
prices have changed little from their high summer levels. In recent weeks, there
have been no major problems with gasoline pipelines or disruptions at refineries,
and gasoline inventories have recovered considerably. Stock levels are
currently only about 4 percent below the norm for this time of year-not a
serious shortfall. In response, refiners' margins for gasoline have fallen
markedly from summer levels, and these margins are now only slightly above
normal.
Food price developments. The consumer price index for food rose just a tad in
October. The price index for fruits and vegetables moved up briskly for the
fourth month in a row, but most other food categories recorded only small price
increases or outright declines. On a current-methods basis, the twelve-month
change in the CPI for food has moved up about 3/4 of a percentage point this
year, to 2-1/2 percent. Although this step-up in food prices probably has been
driven to some degree by the same factors that have affected the core
CPI-including the rise in energy costs-an upturn in farm prices has likely
contributed as well. The USDA's index of prices received by farmers moved up
more than 4 percent over the twelve months ended in November and seems
likely to post its first Q4-to-Q4 increase since 1996.
Labor costs. We have received little new information on labor costs since the
last Greenbook. According to the latest reading, the productivity and cost
measure of compensation per hour increased 6.3 percent in the third quarter,
essentially the same as the increase that had been reported previously. For the
fourth quarter, our only hard figures are for average hourly earnings, which rose
0.4 percent in November, the same as in October. This measure of wages is up
4.0 percent over the past twelve months, compared with an increase of
3.6 percent over the year-earlier period. Regarding bonuses, we have little solid
information about how the fourth quarter is shaping up, although a number of
anecdotal reports suggest that employees at some firms are demanding cash
bonuses instead of stock options. In addition, early reports suggest that Wall
Street bonuses will be up on average from last year, although employees in lines
of business that have been less profitable-such as junk bond operations-likely
will receive bonuses below those of last year.10

included in the first-quarter figure.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Treasury yields have dropped as much as 40 basis points over the intermeeting
period, amid increasing expectations of monetary policy ease sparked by weaker
readings on the economy and perceived risks to the outlook from financial
strains. In corporate markets, yields on top-rated bonds also have declined, but
less than those on Treasuries. By contrast, yields on speculative-grade debt are
up nearly 40 basis points on mounting concerns about deteriorating balance
sheets and bleaker prospects for earnings in an environment of slower economic
growth. Despite these concerns, the broadest equity indexes only edged down,
on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors drew comfort from signals that
the FOMC was moving to the view that policy risks were balanced.
The pace of investment-grade bond offerings picked up from the depressed
October level, and commercial paper issuance, especially by the top-rated
borrowers, rebounded notably in November. However, lower-rated issuers
largely remained on the sidelines, and business borrowing from banks continued
to be quite weak. Equity issuance strengthened in the first half of November but
has been anemic since then. Measures of credit quality in the business sector
have continued to deteriorate, and some slippage has emerged for households.
Household borrowing, nonetheless, has been well maintained in the fourth
quarter at a pace a notch below that of the first half.
Policy Expectations and Year-End Pressures
Further signs of continued subpar economic growth have prompted a notable
downward revision in the market's expected path for monetary policy. Before
the November meeting, a minority of market participants anticipated that the
FOMC might shift to a neutral balance-of-risks statement at the December
meeting as a prelude to policy easing next year. Over the intermeeting period, a
substantial majority came to that view, and market participants notched down
by nearly half a percentage point the funds rate level they expect by the end of
next year. Many now anticipate that the policy easing will begin at the January
meeting.
Year-end pressures for highly rated borrowers seem relatively modest this year.
Spreads of thirty-day libor and A1/P1 nonfinancial commercial paper rates over
the target funds rate are much lower than at this time in 1998 and 1999. Nearly
two-thirds of top-rated commercial paper issuers reportedly have completed
their over-the-year funding, about the same, on average, as in 1998 and 1999.
By contrast, year-end pressures for lower-rated borrowers appear to be
considerably more pronounced. The spread of thirty-day A2/P2 nonfinancial
commercial paper rates over the target funds rate has risen well above the
average for the more normal year-ends in 1995-97 and is just a little narrower

than it was at the end of 1998 and 1999, both years of above-average tension in
the markets.
The elevated year-end pressure for weaker credits seems to be almost entirely
an indication of investors' aversion to risk around year-end rather than an
expectation that overnight rates will be especially high at year-end. Indeed, if
anything, the December federal funds futures rate-at 6.46 percent-suggests
that market participants expect the Desk again to keep the funds rate on the soft
side of the target as the year draws to a close.
Business Finance
Equity analysts have continued to mark down their forecasts of corporate
earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2001. During November, they trimmed
3 percentage points from their forecasts of fourth-quarter earnings, leaving
estimated growth of S&P 500 companies from four quarters ago at less than
4 percent. Year-ahead growth forecasts were lowered nearly 2 percentage
points, the largest monthly revision since the end of 1998. The downward
revisions have continued into December, amid further warnings from closely
watched corporations that sales and earnings would not meet analysts'
expectations.
The revised outlook for the growth of corporate earnings precipitated significant
price revaluations until the Chairman's speech on December 5, but equity
markets have since retraced most of the loss. Since the last FOMC meeting, the
broadest equity indexes are down a touch, on net, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq
is down nearly 7 percent.
The dimming outlook for earnings contributed to further reassessments of credit
risk. Spreads on investment-grade debt widened only slightly, but spreads of
junk bond yields over yields on AAA-rated bonds jumped as much as 100 basis
points, reaching the highest levels since 1991 before easing a little in more
recent days. The spread of yields on small junk-rated bonds over yields on large
junk-rated bonds also rose substantially, suggesting increased concern about the
liquidity of smaller issues.
Gross bond issuance in November rose to $26 billion, more than double the
weak pace in October, with the pickup dominated by large issues by investment-
grade companies. Facing choosy investors, a number of issuers sweetened their
offerings with convertibility features and covenants to increase coupon
payments if the bonds were downgraded. Junk-rated issuance remained weak in
November; wide yield spreads and outflows from high-yield mutual funds
suggest that junk offerings will be scarce during the remainder of the year.
Sources of short-term business credit were similarly selective. Growth in C&I
loans remained sluggish, barely edging up in November. Concurrent with the

run-up in risk spreads on bonds, the spreads on the portions of syndicated loans
held by banks and rated below-investment-grade climbed in November. By
contrast, the average spread on loans reported in the Survey of Terms of
Business Lending (STBL)-which are generally of higher quality and shorter
maturity than leveraged syndicated credits--dipped in the most recent survey
taken during the week of November 6. Judging from the syndicated loan market
and the STBL, the increase in the cost of business credit at banks has been tilted
toward lower-rated borrowers. In addition, surveys by the National Federation
of Independent Business indicate that credit conditions have firmed for smaller
businesses in recent months.
Top-rated commercial paper issuers had little difficulty raising funds, and
outstanding paper rose to more than $6 billion in November. In contrast,
A2/P2-rated issuers found it increasingly difficult to float paper extending into
next year, as credit-quality concerns reinforced the normal reluctance by
investors to show lower-rated paper on their books at year-end.
As in the bond markets, sizable offerings by a few large, well-known firms
dominated the market for equity issues. Initial public offerings were a paltry
$1.7 billion in November, while seasoned offerings totaled nearly $9 billion, up
substantially from the October level. So far in December, equity issuance has
been light despite a long list of firms with registered offerings.
Announcements of share repurchases in the fourth quarter held at a level well
below the average pace of recent years. Reduced earnings have made share
repurchases less attractive despite the recent drop in some equity prices. Equity
retirements, largely associated with previously announced foreign takeovers,
have been brisk thus far in the fourth quarter, and the list of pending deals
suggests that net equity retirements will remain high in coming quarters.
The credit quality of U.S. businesses has deteriorated further in recent months.
The liabilities of failed businesses surged in November, boosted by the failure
of one large telecommunications firm and two smaller firms in the steel sector.
The major rating agencies again handed out more downgrades than upgrades.
Significantly, AT&T and Daimler-Chrysler were downgraded, providing some
evidence of a deterioration in credit quality in the investment-grade sector.
The delinquency rate on C&I loans at domestic commercial banks continued to
trend up in the third quarter, albeit from very low levels. At the 100 largest
banks, the C&I loan delinquency rate was at the highest level since the
beginning of 1994. Moreover, the delinquency rate on C&I loans at other
banks, which has changed little over the past five years, has recently edged up.
Investors' concerns about loan quality has resulted in higher funding costs for a
number of large banking organizations, as is evident from higher spreads on

their subordinated debt and declines in their share prices, perhaps reinforcing a
sense of caution in making loans.
Commercial Real Estate
Since the last FOMC meeting, interest rates on AAA-rated commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have declined about the same amount as
the rate on comparable ten-year swaps. Our most recent data indicate that the
pace of CMBS issuance in the fourth quarter is about the same as it was in the
third quarter. Growth in commercial mortgage debt from all sources is
projected to trend down further in the fourth quarter. Credit problems in this
sector have not been evident, as delinquency rates on commercial mortgage debt
have remained very low.
Household Finance
Recent stock market declines have reduced the level of household assets relative
to disposable income, bringing the ratio back down to the levels prevailing in
mid-1999. However, the decline has reversed only a small part of the
cumulative rise since the mid-1990s.
Available data on mutual funds suggest that inflows to equity funds slumped in
November, reflecting weaker inflows to higher-risk capital appreciation funds
and a sizable outflow from international funds. Inflows to retail money market
funds jumped in November, largely reflecting increased household demand for
stable-value securities. Looking at 401(k) pension plans, both the share of
contributions allocated to equities and plan transfers were about unchanged
through November, and the general direction of transfers continues to be out of
equities and into stable-value investments.
Household debt appears to be growing at about an 8 percent rate in the fourth
quarter, the same as the third-quarter pace, pushing up our measure of the debt-
service burden another notch. Delinquencies on residential mortgages, credit
cards, and other consumer loans at domestic commercial banks ticked up in the
third quarter, but remain at the low end of their respective ranges over the past
several years.
Interest rates charged by banks on new-car loans and on home equity lines of
credit are essentially unchanged since the most recent FOMC meeting. Interest
rates on fixed-rate mortgages have declined almost a quarter of a percentage
point, while those on adjustable-rate mortgages are about unchanged.
Treasury Finance
In a departure from patterns in recent months, the Treasury was a significant net
borrower last month, raising more than $40 billion in new cash with marketable
debt. For the most part, the jump in Treasury borrowing simply reflected
seasonal funding needs ahead of the December corporate tax date. The new

cash was also used to finance the continued net redemptions of maturing coupon
securities and the Treasury buyback program.
Bid-ask spreads for most Treasury issues rose slightly over the intermeeting
period. In part, the increase reflects a heightened sense of caution among
market participants in advance of year-end, as well as recent market volatility.
However, bid-ask spreads for most issues have been edging up throughout the
year, most likely owing to some dropoff in market activity, apparently brought
about by the reduced frequency and size of Treasury auctions and the substantial
paydown of Treasury coupon securities this year.
Agency Finance
Issuance of agency debt securities has continued at a strong clip. Freddie Mac
sold $6 billion of three-year Reference notes, the first sale of a three-year
bellwether note by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. In addition, Fannie Mae
issued $6 billion of five-year Benchmark notes in early December, an auction
that was heavily oversubscribed. The total amount of Benchmark and
Reference notes and bonds outstanding increased to more than $300 billion, as
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to substitute borrowing in their
bellwether debt programs for other types of borrowing. Issuance of Benchmark
and Reference bills has also remained robust. Despite heavy issuance, agency
spreads over Treasury yields have narrowed a bit. Yields on longer-term
agency debt, as well as swap rates, reportedly benefited from increased demands
from investors seeking to extend the duration of their mortgage portfolios in
light of heightened prepayment risks.
Outside of the Reference and Benchmark securities programs, Freddie Mac sold
E5 billion of five-year EuroReference notes, the second auction of
EuroReference securities since the inception of this program in September 2000.
The five-year note auction drew wider international interest than the inaugural
offering, perhaps reflecting a more positive outlook for the European currency
as well as strong global investor appetite for agency securities.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross offerings of long-term debt by state and local governments in October
and November exceeded the pace set in the first three quarters of the year,
boosted by stronger issuance for new capital projects. As has been the case for
some time, projects in the education and transportation sectors accounted for the
largest shares of new capital raised. Yields on long-term revenue and general
obligation bonds fell through early December, though not as much as corporate
bond yields, leaving the ratio of yields on thirty-year revenue bonds to yields on
AAA-rated corporate bonds up a bit since the most recent FOMC meeting.
The credit quality of state and local issuers has continued to improve, on net,
with ratings upgrades outpacing downgrades by a wide margin. The only

with reductions in reimbursements from Medicare and health maintenance

Money and Bank Credit
Following a decline in October, bank credit (adjusted for mark-to-market
effects) advanced at a 3 percent annual rate in November. All categories of
loans registered growth, with the largest pickup in real estate and consumer
loans; the former rebounded sharply, in part because of a dearth of
securitization, and the latter resumed growing at a moderate pace, buoyed by
strong growth in credit card loans.
Small banks continued to expand their business lending last month, while C&I
loans at large domestic banks and branches and agencies of foreign banks again
contracted. For the banking sector as a whole, business loans advanced at a
mere 1 percent annual rate in November. The tepid growth in recent months
may reflect in part the high cost of business loans and tighter credit standards at
commercial banks.
Bank holdings of securities contracted in November for the fourth consecutive
month. The declines have been concentrated at a few large domestic banks that
have simultaneously run off their managed liabilities.1 Several of these banks
had announced significant loan losses and may be reacting to increased funding
costs.
Profits at domestic commercial banks rebounded in the third quarter. Much of
the improvement reflected a substantial decline in noninterest expense, which
had been elevated by restructuring charges at two large institutions during the
second quarter. Smoothing through these swings, bank profits have declined on
balance in recent quarters, squeezed by the combination of rising funding costs,
weaker earnings from trading activities, and competitive lending markets.
Domestic commercial banks, however, remained well capitalized, and all three
regulatory capital ratios inched up in the third quarter.
Growth of M2 slowed over October and November, perhaps reflecting the
downshift in nominal GDP growth. The slowdown in November, to
2-3/4 percent at an annual rate, was concentrated in retail money funds;
however, growth in retail money funds increased appreciably in the later part of
November, too late to boost the average growth in that month. Growth in liquid
deposits (the sum of checking and savings accounts) and currency was also
anemic in November. Like M2, M3 has expanded less rapidly in recent
1. The nearly 20 percent drop in securities holdings in October also partly reflected a
rebooking of securities held by a U.S. branch of a foreign bank to its head office.

The value of exports of goods and services declined slightly in September
(largely machinery and automotive products) following a sharp jump in August.
For the third quarter, the value of exports rose at about the same strong pace
recorded in the second quarter (close to 17 percent at an annual rate), led by
increases in exported machinery (a broad range of products) and industrial
supplies (particularly fuels and chemicals). There were smaller increases in
exported agricultural, consumer, and automotive products as well as services.
Most of the increase in exports went to countries in Latin America and Asia.
The value of imports of goods and services jumped 3 percent in September with
increases in all major trade categories (especially industrial supplies,
semiconductors, and services). The higher value of imported oil was entirely the
result of a jump in price of about $2.50 per barrel. For the third quarter, the
value of imports of goods and services rose at a somewhat stronger pace than
during the first two quarters of the year (close to 20 percent at an annual rate)
with the increase spread among all major categories of trade.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The price of imported oil (BLS) declined 3.2 percent in October following
an increase of 11.0 percent in September. In late September, following the
Clinton administration's decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
fell from its post Gulf War high of $37.20 per barrel to near $30 per barrel.

During October and November, however, spot oil prices again moved higher as
tensions in the Middle East and Iraqi threats to suspend exports raised the
possibility that oil supplies from the region could be disrupted. The onset of
cold weather also provided a boost to prices. Spot WTI averaged over $34 per
barrel during November, but in early December fell below $30 per barrel, as the
United Nations approved a new phase of the oil-for-food program for Iraq and as
supply concerns were allayed by strong statements from major oil producing and
consuming nations.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods were unchanged in October
after dipping in September and showing only small changes in previous months
of the year. For October, increased prices of imported industrial supplies (led by
rising natural gas prices), semiconductors, and automotive products were offset
by declines in prices of computers, other machinery, consumer goods, and foods.
Prices of core goods imports (which exclude oil, computers, and
semiconductors) rose 0.1 percent in October, slightly less than the monthly
average for the previous two quarters. In the third quarter, the NIPA price of
core goods imports rose 1.4 percent at an annual rate, slightly less than in the
second quarter and about the same as recorded during the past year. The
increase in the third quarter was attributable to prices of industrial supplies and,
to a much lesser extent, to automotive products. The price indexes of imported
machinery, consumer goods, and foods all declined in the third quarter.
Exports. Prices of total goods exports resumed a recent downward trend in
October following a moderate increase in September. Prices of agricultural
exports rose in October (primarily increasing grain prices), but at a much slower
rate than in September when prices shifted to positive from negative changes.
For nonagricultural exports, prices declined slightly in October largely because
of industrial supplies. Prices of exported fuel-which had jumped substantially in
September-fell in October. In the third quarter, NIPA prices of exported core
goods (which exclude computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products)
rose 1.1 percent at an annual rate, the smallest increase since the second quarter
of 1999.
Note: BLS prices for imports and exports in November were released on
December 13 and will be included in the Greenbook supplement.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States increased marginally in October
(line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table). An overall
decrease in the holdings of Treasury securities of $7 billion (primarily Treasury
bonds) was more than offset by increases in holdings of agency bonds
($5 billion) and deposits in U.S. banks ($3 billion). Significant increases were

IV-6
recorded for Germany and China, while Russian reserves continued to increase
slightly and those of OPEC countries remained unchanged. The largest
decreases for the month were in the reserves of Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and
Singapore. Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate a
decline of $1 billion in foreign official assets held at the Bank in November.
The substantial decrease in Turkey's reserves ($6 billion), stemming from the
country's banking crisis, was largely offset by increases elsewhere.
Private foreigners bought net some $46 billion of U.S. securities in October, up
from $31 billion in September (line 4). Total foreign net purchases of
$345 billion through the first 10 months of 2000 are on pace to break the annual
record of $348 billion set in 1997. In contrast to net sales for calendar year 1999
and the first three quarters of 2000, foreigners bought net $4 billion of Treasury
securities in October, as purchases of Treasury bonds easily outweighed small
net sales of Treasury bills. Net purchases of Treasury bonds in the Caribbean
financial centers, Hong Kong, and Japan more than offset net sales in Europe.
Net foreign purchases of U.S. agency bonds reached a record level of $13 billion
in October and were recorded predominantly for the United Kingdom, the
Caribbean, and Asia (principally Japan). Although widening credit spreads
resulted in a significant falloff in new U.S. corporate debt issues in both the
domestic and foreign markets in October, foreign demand for U.S. corporate
bonds remained strong with net purchases of $13 billion. Foreign demand for
U.S. debt has been supported by a willingness of highly-rated U.S. firms to issue
in foreign currencies, filling a void in the foreign markets. Foreign net
purchases of U.S. equities rebounded in October to $16 billion, up from $9
billion in September. Significant net purchases of U.S. stocks were reported for
Europe ($6 billion) and nearly $3 billion each for Japan and Singapore. The
largest net foreign sales, amounting to $4 billion, were recorded for the
Caribbean financial centers.
In October, net U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) were entirely
accounted for by the receipt of $22 billion in foreign stocks resulting from
equity-financed takeovers of U.S. companies by European and Canadian
multinationals (shown separately in 5c). Otherwise, in regular market activity,
net U.S. purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) of $3 billion were exactly offset by
net U.S. sales of foreign stocks (line 5b).
The U.S. banking sector recorded a net inflow of $31 billion (line 3) in October
as a result of increased flows into U.S.-incorporated banks from their related
foreign offices. This contrasts with a net outflow of $36 billion in September.
BEA will publish Balance of Payments data for the third quarter, including
estimates of direct investment financial flows, on Thursday, December 14.
These data will be discussed in the Greenbook Supplement.

Foreign Exchange Markets
In the period since the November FOMC meeting, the exchange value of the
dollar against a weighted average of other major foreign currencies at first
continued to appreciate, but subsequently fell sharply; on balance the index
declined 0.7 percent during the intermeeting period, due largely to the dollar's
2.5 percent net depreciation against the euro. In the days following the FOMC
meeting, the dollar appreciated 2.3 percent against the euro in response to a
weaker-than-expected reading on German business sentiment for October. After
November 24, the dollar-euro exchange rate reversed direction, depreciating
4.7 percent. This turnaround occurred even though the downward revision to
U.S. third quarter GDP growth was smaller than market participants had
expected and incoming data indicated that German GDP growth slowed in the
third quarter. Apparently, market participants came to the view that U.S. growth
is moderating more rapidly than euro-area growth in the fourth quarter. The
British pound and the Swiss franc generally followed the movements of the euro
over the intermeeting period. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England,
and the Swiss National Bank did not adjust their policy rates during the period,
whereas Sweden's Riksbank raised its repo rate 25 basis points on December 7,
citing projections that output growth will be "substantially above potential in the
years ahead."

The dollar appreciated 3.7 percent on balance against the yen during the
intermeeting period. Even though a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister
Mori failed on November 20, the political future of the ruling LDP party remains

IV-9
clouded. Disappointing earnings reports, company restructuring announcements,
and falling consumer prices also appeared to weigh on the yen. The December
Tankan survey also showed weaker-than-expected business sentiment. The
Bank of Japan did not adjust its policy stance, resisting calls by LDP officials to
lower overnight interest rates back to zero. The dollar depreciated 1.4 percent
against the Canadian dollar, following the re-election of the current government
in Canada.
During the intermeeting period, headline euro-area equity market indices
declined modestly and Japanese share prices increased. However, technology
indices fell sharply early in the period, but subsequently retraced some of these
losses as the Nasdaq rebounded in early December. Ten-year government bond
yields fell 26 basis points in the euro area and 19 basis points in the United
Kingdom, compared to a 44 basis point drop in the United States and a 10 basis
point decline in Japan.

The dollar's exchange value against a group of currencies of our other important
trading partners rose 0.6 percent during the intermeeting period, due largely to a
4.6 percent appreciation versus the Korean won and a 2.7 percent appreciation
versus the Taiwan dollar. Concerns about waning demand for technology
exports weighed on the outlook for these two economies. Share prices in
Taiwan and Korea declined sharply, led by shares of microchip-producing

IV-10
companies, but Korean share prices rebounded late in the intermeeting period in
line with the Nasdaq.
Prices in emerging Latin American equity markets fell as well. Share prices in
Argentina and Mexico declined 4.8 and 4.1 percent, respectively, as Argentina's
economic situation remained vulnerable. Share prices in Brazil initially fell, but
retraced these losses late in the intermeeting period, finishing up 3.2 percent on
net. Argentina's EMBI+ spread initially widened 46 basis points, but later
narrowed after the lower house of the Argentine Congress approved a 2001
budget that was in line with IMF requirements for receiving a support package.

Concerns about Turkey's banking system threatened to develop into a financial
crisis. Foreign exchange reserves flowed out, putting pressure on the country's
crawling peg exchange rate system, and domestic overnight deposit rates for
some banks spiked as high as 1,950 percent in early December after the Central
Bank of Turkey ceased to provide emergency liquidity. Rates later eased back to
around 100 percent following the announcement by the Managing Director of
the IMF that he was prepared to recommend a new Supplemental Reserve
Facility for Turkey to the IMF Executive Board. Turkish EMBI+ spreads
widened 312 basis points before the announcement, but narrowed 111 basis
points subsequently. The equity market fell 44 percent ahead of the IMF
announcement, but later rebounded sharply.

period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the November Greenbook show that growth in the foreign
industrial countries slowed moderately in the third quarter and point to a further
slowdown in the fourth quarter. In the euro area, growth edged down to just
below a 2-3/4 percent pace in the third quarter, as consumer spending appeared
to be hurt by higher interest rates and the income effects of higher prices for oil
and imported goods. Consumption also was weak in Japan, and recent data
point to continued sluggish economic growth. Canadian real GDP expanded at a
rapid 4.8 percent pace in the third quarter, but a sizable buildup of inventories
and signs of stalling export growth suggest weaker economic growth in the
current quarter.
Continued high oil prices kept broad measures of inflation near their peaks in
October, but core inflation remained relatively subdued. Twelve-month
consumer price inflation in the euro area was 2.7 percent, well above the
European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling, but core inflation (excluding
food and energy prices) remained below 1.5 percent. Canadian consumer price
inflation approached the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent
inflation target band, but core inflation moved up only slightly to 1.5 percent. In
the United Kingdom, retail price inflation remained below the 2.5 percent target
rate, while in Japan consumer price deflation persisted at about 1 percent.
In Japan, economic growth slowed from its rapid pace in the first half of the
year to a 1 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Public investment declined at
an annual rate of 36.5 percent as the effect of last year's stimulus measures
started to fade, and private consumption was flat. The primary source of growth
was private nonresidential investment, which rose 35 percent at an annual rate.
However, more recent information on capital spending suggest that this figure
will be revised down substantially. The few indicators we have for the fourth
quarter suggest continued sluggishness. In October, industrial production was
just 0.3 percent above the third-quarter level. Housing starts and new car
registrations, which both fell in the third quarter, were down further in October.
The BOJ's December Tankan survey was disappointing. The sentiment index
for all industries increased only slightly, from -15 to -14, below the previous
expectation of an increase to -11. The index is now expected to fall back to -15
in the next survey in March 2001. The index for large manufacturers was
unchanged from the last survey at +10. Sentiment worsened a bit for large non-
manufacturers, but improved slightly for small and medium-sized firms in both
categories, although by less than expected in the previous survey.

2. Percentage point contribution to GDP growth, s.a.a.r.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7 percent in October, while the
job-offers-to-applicants ratio rose slightly to 0.64. Deflation in core consumer
goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy)
has intensified despite the increase in energy prices, with prices down
0.9 percent in November from a year earlier. Twelve-month inflation in
wholesale prices for domestic goods has turned slightly negative in recent
months. The GDP deflator in the third quarter was down 1.6 percent from its
year-ago level, its tenth consecutive quarterly decline.
Japan's merchandise trade surplus for the first ten months of 2000 was $108
billion (s.a.a.r.), down slightly from the same period last year, as both exports
and imports have increased sharply. The developing Asian countries continue to
account for most of the export gain, while higher oil prices have contributed
significantly to the increase in dollar-denominated imports.
On December 5, the Japanese Cabinet was reshuffled by Prime Minister Mori.
Mori drew almost exclusively from the ruling three-party coalition, with several
current ministers retaining their positions. Although reforms intended to
streamline government operations by consolidating the current 23 ministries and

The pace of economic growth in the euro area moderated in the third quarter.
Real GDP expanded an estimated 2.7 percent (s.a.a.r.). Growth in consumption
expenditures was notably weaker than in the first half of the year, and net
exports subtracted over half a percentage point from growth. Investment
spending increased about 5 percent, about the same pace as in the first half of the
year. Among the major euro-area countries, growth slowed notably in Germany,
primarily reflecting weakness in consumption expenditures. Net exports made a
small contribution to German growth. In France, real GDP growth was a bit
weaker than in the second quarter. Net exports subtracted 1.7 percentage points
from growth while inventory accumulation contributed 2 percentage points.

Data for the current quarter point to a continued moderate pace of growth.
German industrial production contracted 0.4 percent (s.a.) in October. The
decline was fairly broad-based, with contractions in the production of both
capital and consumer goods. Consumer confidence in the euro area moved
down from a record-high level in September and has stabilized in more recent
months. Industrial confidence edged down in November after reaching a record
high in July. The euro-area purchasing managers' surveys moved down for the
sixth consecutive month in October. However, German manufacturing orders
rebounded in October, with improvement in both domestic and foreign orders.
In France, consumption of manufacturing products rose 1.5 percent in October,
after registering sizable declines in both August and September, suggesting that
consumption may pick up somewhat in the current quarter.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area was 8.9 percent in
October, down nearly a full percentage point from a year ago, largely reflecting
improved employment growth this year. More recent data for Germany show

that, on a national basis, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.3 percent in
both October and November, after declining earlier in the year.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.2 percent (s.a.) in October, leaving the
twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation at 2.7 percent, well above the
ECB's 2 percent target ceiling. Excluding food and energy prices, the increase
was also 0.2 percent in October, and the twelve-month inflation rate was

On December 11, the European Union (EU) summit concluded with members
reaching a compromise on the weighting of EU Council votes. Most important,
the agreement prepares the ground for EU enlargement as early as 2004, as the
number of votes each candidate country will receive when it enters the EU was
also set. In addition, the members agreed to extend the system of qualified
majority voting to several areas including the EU budget and trade in financial
services, eliminating the need for unanimity on these issues. However, the
system of qualified majority voting does not extend to other important areas
such as taxation or social security reform.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 2.9 percent (s.a.a.r) in the third
quarter. Total domestic demand rose 4.6 percent, as consumption and
government expenditures registered strong gains. Strength in domestic demand
was partially offset by a large negative contribution from net exports, as import
growth remained robust but export growth declined.

Early indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that expansion of activity will
continue to slow. Industrial production fell 0.2 percent (s.a.) in the month of
October, contracting for the second consecutive month, and the average volume
of retail sales remained flat in October at a level 0.5 percent above the third-
quarter average. Business confidence remains below levels recorded earlier this

IV-18
year. The expected volume of retail sales and orders in November are down
from third-quarter levels. Consumer confidence is at the year's lowest level.

Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate remained at 3.6 percent in November, the lowest rate in 25 years. However,
average annual earnings growth in October was below the 4.5 percent rate that
the Bank of England believes to be compatible with the inflation target.
Producer input prices have been rising sharply, in part reflecting higher oil
prices. Nevertheless, the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest rates) remains below the 2-1/2 percent target, as price
discounting has continued in the goods sector.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown released the Pre-Budget Report on
November 8, 2000. The fiscal stance is approximately the same as was
forecasted in the March budget, with the fiscal year 2000-2001 budget surplus
estimated at £16.6 billion (nearly 2 percent of 1999 GDP).
In its November Inflation Report, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank
of England released its latest GDP and inflation forecasts. Under the assumption

IV-19
that official interest rates remain unchanged at 6 percent, GDP growth is
expected to ease to a trend rate of 2-1/2 percent next year and continue at that rate
in 2002. After a temporary spike in inflation in the coming months, as the
impact of higher oil prices feeds through to inflation, the central projection for
inflation is a gradual rise over the next two years, with inflation hitting the target
of 2-1/2 percent by the end of 2002.
Real GDP in Canada rose a stronger-than-expected 4.8 percent (s.a.a.r) in the
third quarter, fueled by a 7.6 percent increase in domestic demand. Consumer
spending rose 5.5 percent, with robust demand for durable goods leading the
way. Investment, which rose 9.4 percent, was again led by strong business
investment in communication, computer, and office equipment. Inventory
investment surged, contributing 1.7 percentage points to third-quarter growth.
Export growth was slightly negative, while imports rose 5.9 percent, causing net
exports to subtract 2.6 percentage points from overall growth.

Limited available data for the current quarter suggest the economy retains
considerable strength, although some signs of slowing are present. Employment
in October and November, on average, increased 0.6 percent from the third
quarter, after rising only 0.2 percent in the entire third quarter. However, recent
indicators suggest that activity in the manufacturing sector is moderating, with

new orders for manufactured goods falling in September for the second
consecutive month.

Higher energy prices pushed the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation
to 2.8 percent in October, near the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to
3 percent target range. However, the twelve-month core rate of inflation (which
excludes food and energy prices) was up only 1.5 percent in October, in line
with the rate of increase observed over most of this year. Wage increases also
moderated, with average hourly earnings rising 3.3 percent in the twelve months
ending in November, down from growth of close to 4 percent earlier in the year.
In the national election held on November 27, Canada's Prime Minister Jean
Chretien and the Liberal party won a third consecutive majority government.
The Liberals now hold 173 of the 301 seats in Parliament, an increase from 161
before the election. The separatist Bloc Quebecois party lost seats in the election.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in the world's major developing countries has begun to show
signs of slowing. In Latin America, these signs included a moderation of growth
in Mexico and a fall in Venezuelan third-quarter real GDP. In Argentina, in
response to ongoing concerns about the government's financing situation, a large
international assistance package is being put into place. In emerging Asia,
although economic growth remained generally strong, there were indications that
activity is moderating in many parts of the region. GDP growth slowed in
Taiwan and the ASEAN countries, and industrial production fell for the second
consecutive month in Korea. In addition, political uncertainty continued to be a
source of concern for several economies in the region.
Inflation has been stable in most of Latin America, while prices continued to fall
in Argentina. In Asia, inflation is starting to rise in the ASEAN countries, but it
does not yet appear to be a problem in the rest of the region.
External performance in the Latin American countries was mixed. Strong oil
exports helped boost the third-quarter Argentine trade balance, while rising
domestic demand fueled higher imports in Mexico. Brazil continued to record
trade deficits. In developing Asian countries, export strength remained the
driving force behind the economic expansion in many countries.
In Turkey, investor concerns about the health of the country's banking system
and the viability of the government's reform program motivated massive capital
outflows and a sharp decline in official foreign exchange reserves. In response,
Turkey announced on December 6 that it had reached agreement with the IMF
on a $10.4 billion rescue package, consisting of $7.5 billion from the
Supplemental Reserve Facility and $2.9 billion from the country's current
stand-by arrangement. In return, Turkey promised that it will hasten banking
sector reforms and privatization.
In Argentina, there has been little sign of a pickup in economic conditions since
the last Greenbook. Industrial production fell 1.2 percent in October following a
3 percent decline in the third quarter. Prices also continued to drop, with the
level of prices in November slightly below the third-quarter average.
Construction data remained depressed, with consecutive monthly declines in
building permits. Political uncertainty and turmoil in financial markets appear to
have further shaken consumer confidence, and VAT receipts, viewed as a signal
of consumption expenditures, came in well below expectations in November.
On the positive side, export growth remains healthy, due in large part to the
strength in oil prices, and, when combined with flat import growth, allowed the
trade balance to remain in surplus through October.

IV-25
In early November, heightened market concerns about the ability of Argentina to
finance its large external debt and fiscal deficit resulted in extremely volatile
market conditions. On November 10, when Argentina appeared on the brink of
losing access even to domestic capital markets, the government announced that a
substantial financial assistance package would be put in place, including
significant assistance from the IMF. The market reaction was generally positive,
with spreads falling considerably, though remaining elevated compared with this
summer's levels. The details of the package have yet to be released, but its size
is now estimated to be around $30 billion over three years, including funds from
the international financial institutions, domestic banks, and private pension
funds. Argentina's current $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with the IMF,
around $2 billion of which is expected to be accessed by the end of the year, is
included as part of the package. The announcement of the package is contingent
on government progress on meeting four main economic conditions-the passage
of the 2001 federal budget, a fiscal pact with the provinces limiting spending,
social security reform, and deregulation of the health care system.

In Mexico, the economy remained strong, but growth moderated further in the
third quarter, coming in at 5.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) compared with a revised estimate
of 6.7 percent in the previous quarter. Industrial production declined 1.2 percent
(s.a.) in October, but the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate also fell in that
month, indicating that labor markets remain tight. Although export growth
continued to be robust, the expansion of domestic demand fueled imports. The
current account deficit widened slightly in the third quarter to a little over
$16 billion (a.r.), and the trade deficit (s.a.) also increased in October.
Inflation remained stable, with consumer prices rising less than 9 percent in
November on a twelve-month basis. However, the Bank of Mexico tightened
monetary policy in mid-November, due to survey data that indicated that
inflation expectations for 2001 were still significantly higher than the
government's 6.5 percent target. Monetary tightening has left short-term interest
rates about four percentage points higher than they were after July's presidential
elections.

The new government took office on December 1, when Vincente Fox was
inaugurated as president. The key cabinet position of finance minister went to
Francisco Gil Diaz, who has worked in the finance ministry, the central bank,
and the private sector. Gil is generally regarded as the person most likely to
succeed in bringing about fiscal reform next year. The first big test for the Fox
administration will be getting the 2001 budget through the new Congress, where
no party has a working majority in either house. The proposed budget, which
seeks to trim next year's fiscal deficit to 0.5 percent of GDP from 1 percent of
GDP this year, was sent to Congress on December 5. The assumptions of the
proposed budget include real GDP growth slowing to 4.5 percent next year from
over 7 percent expected growth this year, inflation declining to 6.5 percent, and
oil prices (Mexican mix) falling to an average of $18 per barrel from an average
of more than $25 per barrel this year.
In Brazil, real GDP grew 4.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, following
(revised) growth of 2.1 percent in the second quarter. Growth was led by a
5.2 percent increase in industrial output. Brazil continued to record monthly
trade deficits; while exports have grown about 15 percent in volume terms
during 2000. Imports have also grown, owing to higher oil prices and to growth
of intermediate goods imports. The cumulative current account deficit for 2000
through October was nearly $23 billion at an annual rate, nearly 4 percent of
GDP.
Consumer price inflation has been under control and is expected to end the year
below 6-1/2 percent, well below the 8 percent upper bound of the government's
inflation target range. However, the government has suppressed inflationary
pressures by delaying increases in domestic fuel prices. In late November, the
Brazilian government raised energy prices and announced that, henceforth,
domestic energy prices will be regularly adjusted to better reflect changes in
world oil prices and the real/dollar exchange rate.
The Brazilian government continued its good fiscal performance, with the
primary (non-interest) fiscal surplus during the first ten months of this year
falling a bit below the goal of 3.4 percent of GDP for 2000 as a whole. In recent
weeks, congress has been mired in negotiations over financing a nearly
20 percent increase in the minimum wage (effective April 2001). That increase
would raise federal government expenditures by nearly one-half percent of GDP
on an annualized basis, relative to the baseline assumed in the government's
2001 budget proposal. Congressional approval of the federal government's 2001

On November 20, Banespa, the third largest federal government owned bank,
was sold to Banco Santander Central Hispano for $3.5 billion, three times the
next highest bid. Announcement of the deal prompted a rebound in the real. In
late November, the government issued 60 billion yen (US $550 million) in sixty
three-month Samurai bonds, yielding about 350 basis points above comparable
Japanese government bond yields.
In Venezuela, the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, after strong
growth in the previous quarter. On a four-quarter basis, growth in the third
quarter was 3.3 percent, boosted by strong oil revenue and hefty government
spending. Inflation fell further in the fourth quarter, with prices rising just
14 percent in the twelve months ended November. This compares favorably
with inflation rates of 20 and 30 percent in 1999 and 1998, respectively. In
order to keep inflation low, there is some discussion of moving from a slowly
crawling peg to a fixed exchange rate.

In Korea, real GDP grew strongly in the third quarter, but more recent indicators
suggest that growth is weakening. Real GDP rose at a double-digit annual rate
in the third quarter, over twice the growth rate in the first half of the year.
However, this strong growth was accounted for entirely by a surge in net
exports, as exports, particularly of semiconductors and other high tech products,
grew at a very rapid-almost surely unsustainable-rate. Domestic demand
actually declined in the third quarter. Indexes of consumer and business
sentiment have both decreased in recent months, probably depressed by the
continuing sharp fall in stock prices and, in recent weeks, downward pressure on
the won. Industrial production declined for the second consecutive month in
October. The twelve-month consumer price inflation rate has moved down in
recent months from its September peak.
The government's corporate restructuring program has continued to experience
difficulties. Officials have indicated that an additional 5 trillion won (about
$4 billion) could be needed to complete the restructuring of bankrupt Daewoo
Motor and troubled Hyundai Engineering and Construction. President Kim
Dae-jung recently speculated that, as a result of the second round of corporate
restructuring, the number of unemployed might increase by one-quarter from its
current level.

In the ASEAN region, the economic expansion began to show signs of
weakening during the third quarter. Real GDP fell in Indonesia and Malaysia,
while growth moderated in Singapore and the Philippines. Although exports are
still growing strongly, third quarter oil price increases inflated import numbers,
and that eroded current account surpluses. In addition, elevated oil prices and
the depreciation of the regional currencies have led to a clear trend of rising
inflation.
The political turmoil that has engulfed the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand
continues to pose significant risks. Philippine President Estrada defied
expectations by refusing to resign. His impeachment trial began on December 7
and is expected to continue into the first quarter of next year. Indonesian
President Wahid is facing growing calls for his resignation and could face
impeachment if he refuses to step down. In Thailand, both leading candidates
for prime minister are currently under investigation for corruption, and this has
led to a great deal of uncertainty about the future political landscape and the
course of economic reform.
