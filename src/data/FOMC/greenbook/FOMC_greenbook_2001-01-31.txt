Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity looks to have risen slowly again in the fourth quarter.
Consumer and business spending decelerated further, with outlays for motor
vehicles and other household goods particularly weak. As a result of the
slowing in final sales, inventory overhangs appear to have surfaced in a number
of industries and have set in play sizable production adjustments in
manufacturing that appear to have intensified at the turn of the year. Although
the pace of hiring slackened at the end of 2000, labor markets remained quite
tight, and labor costs were running above the pace of a year ago. At the same
time, price inflation remained quiescent.
Production and Inventories
Industrial production. The contraction in the manufacturing sector, which first
emerged in October, deepened and broadened during November and December.
The December decline was nearly twice that in November, with factory
production falling 1.1 percent last month. As the quarter began, the weakness in
production was largely the result of cutbacks in the motor vehicle industry.
However, in December, the diffusion index of three-month changes in industrial
production fell to its lowest level since 1991, a decline indicating that weakness
extended well beyond the effects of lower motor vehicle assemblies. The
November and December declines in total IP were less steep than in
manufacturing, as the unseasonably cold weather contributed to large gains in
the output of utilities. The plunge in factory production during December does
not appear to have been weather related: The anecdotal information that we
have accumulated suggests that the stormy weather at mid-month had only a
small effect on production, and given the overall weakening in the sector, we
estimate that the weather-related losses that did occur were not made up later in
the month. With cutbacks having occurred in many industries, the factory
operating rate sank to just over 79 percent last month-the lowest level since the
spring of 1992.1
Manufacturing production declined 1.9 percent (not an annual rate) between
September and December. More than two-thirds of that contraction was directly
or indirectly related to the slowing in the motor vehicles sector: The decline in
1. A preliminary estimate of capacity growth in 2001 will be issued with the release of the
report on January industrial activity on February 16. Data from the NAPM Semiannual Survey
of Capacity and other currently available indicators suggest that manufacturing capacity will
increase 3-1/2 percent this year-about 1-1/2 percentage points less than in 2000. This would be
the slowest rate of capacity expansion since 1993.

motor vehicle assemblies over the period directly subtracted almost
1/2 percentage point from IP; the drop in motor vehicle parts and the estimated
effects on upstream industries contributed an additional loss of nearly
3/4 percentage point.2 Despite the fourth-quarter production cutbacks, dealer
stocks of domestic light vehicles continued to edge up in December, and days'
supply jumped to 78 days in December. The backup in inventories of light
trucks was particularly sharp: Days' supply of light trucks shot up to 112 days
at GM and 90 days at Ford last month. Information on automakers' assembly
plans for the first quarter is incomplete, in part because Chrysler will not issue
public reports until after the company's restructuring plans are announced on
February 26. Factoring in the confidential reports that we have compiled from
our industry sources, we estimate that scheduled assemblies for the first quarter
are now around 11 million units (annual rate). However, the latest available
weekly data for January suggest that assemblies were running at only about a
10.4 million unit rate for the first three weeks of the year. Elsewhere in the
transportation equipment sector, aircraft and parts production has been an area
of strength recently.3
2. We estimate that the effects of lower motor vehicle assemblies on parts producers and
upstream industries are 2-1/2 times the change in assemblies. However, the timing of these
effects is uncertain and, in the recent period, muddied by the diffusion of production adjustments
across industries. About three-fifths of the indirect effects implied by the reduction in
assemblies between September and December appear to have been realized by mid-December.
3. Looking forward, we expect some near-term moderation in aircraft production because
plane completions at Boeing are, on net, ahead of schedule.

Production gains in the high-tech sector slowed at the end of last year, and
current indicators suggest near-term weakness. Although gains in
semiconductor production remained fairly steady through December, the pace
was more moderate than earlier in the year. Similarly, this week's Dataquest
survey of semiconductor purchasers suggested that activity levels were little
changed between November and December.4 However, both Dataquest and the
Semiconductor Industry Association project that the rise in chip-industry output
will be restrained in the first half of this year as downstream producers of
computers and communications equipment work off inventories of parts that
have accumulated in the wake of slower demand for their products. Indeed, the
three-month moving average of orders for these goods moved down in
November.
Elsewhere in manufacturing, weakness was widespread at year-end. Excluding
motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, and high-tech goods, production fell
off sharply in each of the major market groups, with particularly steep plunges
in the production of construction supplies and industrial materials. Moreover,
indicators that we have found to be useful predictors of near-term manufacturing
activity outside of motor vehicles and parts production point to further declines
in coming months. Adjusted orders for durable goods, which are only available
through November, were down on a three-month moving-average basis. Both
the NAPM new orders and export orders indexes fell during the fourth quarter,
with the December index for new orders, based on data collected in the middle
of the month, dropping relatively steeply to its lowest level in five years. And,
as previously mentioned, the IP diffusion index, which has predictive value for
the one-month-ahead forecast, fell to its lowest level in 10 years. Finally, based
on reports running through the first week of January, the diffusion index for new
orders in the Philadelphia FRB's Survey of Business plunged; this series, which
was first collected in 1989, is also a statistically significant indicator of
manufacturing activity.
Inventory adjustments. Manufacturers that accumulated outsized inventories
in recent months also slashed production in December and, to a lesser extent,
November. The rapid rise in inventories at producers of construction supplies is
mirrored by the fall-off in production; industry contacts attributed the weakness
to the large inventory overhang. The drop in the output of industrial materials
last quarter was also likely a response to soaring inventory-shipments ratios in
the primary and fabricated metals, rubber and plastics, chemicals, and textiles
and apparel industries; many of these products are inputs to the auto industry.
Inventory accumulation for producers of business equipment other than

orders, after rising steeply earlier last year, were flat in November and December, and lead times
continued to fall.

computers has also picked up over the past few quarters, and production has
dipped recently in that sector as well.
In some sectors, such as textiles, chemicals, and industrial machinery, inventory
imbalances as of November were apparent only in manufacturing. However, in
other sectors, the production adjustments under way in manufacturing also
likely represent a response to a bloating of stocks at other distributors. Notably,
inventory-sales ratios at wholesalers of lumber and at retail building material
and hardware supply stores had been trending up sharply since early last year.
And, overhangs were becoming increasingly apparent at wholesale distributors
of electrical machinery, primary and fabricated metals, and paper products.
Stock-sales ratios for wholesalers of professional equipment (which includes
computers) and at manufacturers of computing equipment (which tend to have
just-in-time inventory adjustments) also had edged up as of November, although
they were still low by historical standards.
Aggregate business inventory investment. Overall, the book value of
manufacturing and trade inventories (excluding motor vehicles) rose at an
annual rate of $53 billion in November, following an $80 billion buildup in
October; the average for the two months was $13 billion higher than the pace
of stockbuilding during the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter,
inventory accumulation picked up in manufacturing-where stocks rose at a
relatively hefty $34 billion average annual rate in October and November-and
in non-auto retailing, where stockbuilding averaged a $19 billion rate.
Accumulations were more moderate in the wholesale sector, where book value
inventories (excluding motor vehicles) rose at an annual rate of about
$14 billion in October and November, $2.5 billion lower than during the third
quarter.
The aggregate inventory-sales ratio for manufacturing and trade (excluding
motor vehicles) was 1.32 months in November, up from the 1.29-month level
seen in August and September. More generally, the downtrends in the
manufacturing, wholesale, and retail inventory-sales ratios outside of motor
vehicles that had been evident during the latter part of the 1990s clearly had
stalled out by last spring. Since then, aggregate stock-sales ratios in the
manufacturing and wholesale sectors have been on a gradual updrift. The
overall inventory-sales ratio at non-auto retailers has been fairly flat for some
time-in November, the ratio was at the top end of the narrow range that has
prevailed since late in 1999.
Labor Market Developments
Labor demand continued to soften in December, as private nonfarm payroll
employment increased only slowly and average workweeks declined. Despite

weaker demand overall, the labor market remained very tight, with the
unemployment rate holding at 4.0 percent in December.
Private nonfarm payrolls rose 49,000 in December to finish a quarter in which
employment gains averaged just 84,000 per month, a substantial deceleration
from earlier last year and the weakest quarter since 1992. Much of the recent
slowdown in aggregate job creation reflects contracting labor demand in
manufacturing. In December, factory payrolls dropped 62,000, bringing the
fourth-quarter average decline to 26,000 per month. Employment in the help
supply industry, which provides many workers to manufacturing but is
classified as part of the services industry, fell an average of 33,000 per month
last quarter, compared with an average monthly increase of 12,000 during the
first nine months of the year. Elsewhere, construction employment in December
declined for a second month; however, analysts at the BLS believe that
unusually cold and stormy weather during the midmonth reference periods for
November and December may have more than accounted for these recent job
losses.
In the private service-producing sector, employment gains slowed to an average
of 109,000 per month in the fourth quarter from a third-quarter pace of 149,000.
However, excluding the declines registered in the help supply component noted
above, the average monthly increase in service-producing jobs was essentially
the same in the third and fourth quarters.
Although private employment, as published, clearly decelerated during the latter
half of 2000, the use of "bias-adjustment factors" to account for increases in
jobs at very young firms could mean that the payroll estimates understate the
degree to which labor demand weakened. In advance of the annual benchmark,
the BLS gets a relatively accurate count of jobs at established firms from the
responses to the payroll survey; however, little contemporaneous information is
available on employment growth at very young firms. Estimates for these
firms-the bias-adjustment factors-are added to the survey-based employment
estimates to produce the published figures. Because these factors are based
predominantly on information from the previous benchmark-which provides
employment counts at essentially all firms-they may not incorporate shifts in
labor market trends in a timely fashion. Indeed, although the recent slowdown
in hiring at established firms likely implies a similar slowdown at very young
firms, the current bias-adjustment factors assumed that hiring at those firms
accelerated in the fourth quarter.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls fell 0.7 percent in December, with the decline largely concentrated in
the goods-producing sector. Aggregate production-worker hours were little
changed, on balance, during the second half of 2000, edging down at an annual

rate of 0.1 percent last quarter after a tepid 0.2 percent rise in the third quarter.5
At least some of December's sharp drop in aggregate hours resulted from the
severe winter storms in the Midwest during the reference period. These storms
kept some workers home for part of the week, shortening the workweek to
34.1 hours in December, its lowest level since the blizzard of January 1996.6
However, December's shorter workweek also reflected weaker labor demand in
manufacturing, where the workweek had already fallen to 41.2 hours in
November, 1/2 hour below its first-half average.
Other available indicators also suggest an easing of labor demand pressures at
the end of last year, albeit in a still-tight labor market overall. The four-week
moving average of unemployment insurance claims climbed steeply into early
January and, although it has moved off its high, remained elevated at midmonth.
Firms surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses reported
some leveling off in the number of positions that they consider hard to fill. The
Conference Board reported that its help-wanted index remained near
November's low level and that the percentage of households viewing jobs as
plentiful fell during the second half of last year. Looking forward, households
responding to both the Conference Board and Michigan consumer surveys
expect that weaker economic activity will lead to rising unemployment in
coming months.
Consumer Spending
Real consumer spending slowed in the fourth quarter as sales of motor vehicles
retreated and outlays for other goods increased only slowly.
Motor vehicles. Sales of light vehicles plunged to an annual rate of
15.3 million units in December. In the fourth quarter, sales averaged
16.2 million units, a sharp deceleration from the 17.6 million-unit pace
registered over the first three quarters of the year.7 The sales slump was
especially hard on the Big Three automakers, whose combined market share fell
to a record low of 64 percent last quarter-about 5 percentage points lower than
their overall share in 1999. About half of this decline can be attributed to a
5. We now estimate that hours of all persons, as calculated for the Productivity and Cost
figures, fell at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the third quarter and 0.9 percent in the fourth
quarter. This series incorporates estimates of hours worked by production and nonproduction
workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers.
6. To avoid conflicting with households' holiday plans in December, the reference period
for the household survey is shifted one week, to the week including the 5th, while the reference
period for the payroll survey remains the pay period that includes the 12th. Therefore, the usual
information on the number of individuals at work part-time due to bad weather collected in the
household survey cannot be used to estimate the effect of bad weather on the December
workweek derived from the payroll survey.
7. Most of the decline in the fourth quarter was due to a step-down in consumer demand,
although fleet sales also fell off from unusually high third-quarter levels.

higher market share for foreign-produced vehicles and half to a higher share for
domestic transplants; these producers have been introducing new models of cars
and light trucks that have proven to be attractive competitors to the Big Three's
models.
Confidential reports from industry analysts suggest that retail demand for light
vehicles has stabilized so far in January.8 Nonetheless, the preliminary reading
from the University of Michigan index of car-buying conditions indicated that
consumer attitudes plummeted in mid-January. In addition to greater pessimism
about the economy, anecdotal reports suggest that consumers, having become
accustomed to sizable rebates and offers of low financing, now feel that current
prices are too high. Indeed, after having dropped for several months, the CPI
for new vehicles moved up 0.1 percent in November and 0.4 percent in
December. These price increases are consistent with the quarterly data on
incentives, which suggest that average incentives per vehicle shrank 9 percent in
the fourth quarter. To date, manufacturers appear to be resisting the temptation
to sweeten incentives to boost sales, although they have extended some offers
that were scheduled to expire at midmonth.
Other consumer spending and income. Nominal outlays in the retail control
group of stores were unchanged in December and, given revised data, little
changed in October and November. Nominal outlays in the GAF group (general
merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance stores) declined in November
and December-readings that are consistent with anecdotal reports of relatively
weak holiday spending. Real purchases of goods, excluding motor vehicles,
increased a mere 3/4 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter. Including
reduced outlays for motor vehicles, we estimate that real expenditures for all
goods declined at an annual rate of about 1 percent last quarter, which would
mark the largest decline in this spending category since the fourth quarter of
1991.9
The most recent information on service expenditures is for November, when real
service outlays are estimated to have risen 0.6 percent. The gain reflected in
part higher consumption of electricity and natural gas that was due to
unseasonably cold weather. However, spending on non-energy services-
which include recreational services and air travel, for which the BEA uses
8. The anecdotal reports also suggest that several firms are boosting fleet sales in January.
9. The only other quarter since 1991:Q4 during which real PCE for goods declined was
1997:Q2, when goods expenditures declined at an annual rate of 0.4 percent.

timely indicators to estimate monthly movements-also posted noticeable gains
in November.10
For December, below-average temperatures are again expected to have provided
a boost to outlays for electricity and natural gas. But we have little information
on purchases of services other than energy. The lone exception is real PCE for
brokerage services, which is estimated by the BEA using stock market volume.
We anticipate that this component of spending will be reported to have posted a
moderate gain in December, reflecting the pickup in trading volume last month.
Income growth has slowed further in recent months. Real disposable personal
income rose about 2-1/4 percent over the twelve months ended in November,
down from a range of year-over-year increases of 2-3/4 to 3-1/4 percent
recorded over much of last year. In addition, the ratio of household net worth to
disposable personal income likely fell again in the fourth quarter to its lowest
level since 1999:Q3. Looking ahead, labor market data for December suggest
only a moderate gain in wage and salary income for the month.
According to the preliminary report on consumer sentiment from the Michigan
Survey, household pessimism about the economic outlook increased at the
outset of this year. The index of consumer sentiment fell almost 5 percentage
points in early January, after a decline of more than 9 percentage points in
December." The index has not had back-to-back monthly declines of this
magnitude since late 1991. As in December, all of the major components of the
aggregate index moved lower. However, the decline was particularly dramatic
for the index of expected business conditions over the next twelve months,
which fell to its lowest level in more than seven years. As noted earlier, the
index of expected unemployment change-which is not included in the overall
measure, but has proven to be a useful indicator of consumer spending-shot up
15 percentage points in early January. This comes on the heels of a
13 percentage point increase in December. Although this index has recorded
larger run-ups than this in a single month, it has not had back-to-back months of
double-digit increases since the middle of 1979.12
10. Spending estimates for categories such as recreational services and air travel, which
comprise about 60 percent of nominal non-energy services, are likely to be better indicators of
current spending activity than are estimates for the remaining 40 percent of non-energy services.
The BEA estimates monthly movements for the remaining services using trend growth rates that
vary little from one month to another. The trends are not fully re-evaluated until the annual
NIPA revision.
11. The final estimate of the index for January will be released on February 2.
12. The largest single-month increase in the expected unemployment index was
28 percentage points in June 1978.

Housing
Construction of single-family housing picked up noticeably in December, likely
boosted by further reductions in mortgage rates, while multifamily construction
continued to decline. Although more timely readings on housing activity were
mixed in January, they appear, on balance, to be consistent with a stabilization
of demand.
Single-family starts jumped 6 percent in December to an annual rate of
1.31 million units, the highest level since last March. However, adjusted
permits for single-family units decreased 1.7 percent in December, to
1.23 million units. These data suggest that the underlying pace of new single-
family construction in December probably remained close to the November
pace, when starts were 1.24 million units. Starts were up 3.4 percent in the
fourth quarter as a whole, marking the first quarterly increase of the year. The
rise in the fourth quarter occurred despite unusually cold weather in November
and December. However, on a construction-weighted basis for the month as a
whole, December also was atypically dry, which likely helped offset some of the
effects of the cold weather on construction. More important, rates on fixed-rate
contracts averaged nearly 7-1/2 percent in December and about 7 percent in the
first three weeks of January. The January reading is 150 basis points below the
peak last May and the lowest monthly average since April 1999. January's
reading for ARM rates is down 35 basis points from May.
Over the past several months, trends in housing starts varied by region. For
example, in the second half of last year-a period in which mortgage rates
declined-starts of single-family homes picked up in the Northeast and
especially in the West; but starts in the South and in the Midwest continued to
trend down. The relatively large decline in the Midwest likely reflects the
greater concentration in that region of manufacturing employment. The regional
pattern in the second half of 2000 for multifamily starts was different, with
starts essentially flat, on balance, in the Northeast and the Midwest, and lower in
the South and especially in the West.
Sales of new homes declined in October and November after a strong showing
in September. Despite these declines, the two-month average annual rate of
919,000 units was 1-3/4 percent above the third-quarter pace. Sales of existing
homes fell about 7-1/2 percent in December to an annual rate of 4.87 million
units, bringing the average for the fourth quarter about 1 percent below that for
the third quarter.
Despite the ongoing declines in mortgage rates, builders' ratings of new-home
sales have declined noticeably since November, and in January ratings reached
their lowest level since mid-1997. However, the Michigan Survey's measure of
household perceptions of homebuying conditions turned up again in January,

mainly because of a rise in the share of respondents who thought that mortgage
rates were relatively low.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts dropped more than 20 percent in
December to an annual rate of 262,000 units, more than offsetting a sharp
increase in November. For the fourth quarter as a whole, multifamily starts fell
3.9 percent. Multifamily permits decreased nearly 16 percent in December.
However, the ratio of starts to permits was below normal, a sign that starts are
likely to pick up in coming months.
Business Investment
Equipment and software. Although the evidence is still incomplete, we
believe that real expenditures on equipment and software were little changed
last quarter. To some extent, the weakening in investment outlays is consistent
with a deterioration in investment fundamentals: Business output and real cash
flow decelerated over the course of 2000, and financial conditions generally
became less favorable as banks tightened lending standards and declining stock
prices boosted the cost of equity finance. Looking ahead, longer-term
borrowing rates have come down, on balance, over the past few months and,
more recently, although they are still high, quality spreads on high-risk debt
have dropped back sharply.
The most recent data on nominal orders and shipments of capital goods extend
only through November, and, excluding transportation equipment, these
indicators were weak. In the high-tech area, shipments of communications
equipment fell in November, leaving the average pace for October and
November near that for the third quarter. Moreover, orders for communications
equipment fell in October and November, setting the stage for further softness in
shipments. Shipments of office and computing equipment also declined in
November, with the average for the October-November period barely exceeding
the third-quarter average. Of course, given the decline in prices of high-tech
equipment, expenditures in real terms are likely to rise in the fourth quarter, and
probably at double-digit rates in the case of computers. Estimated real

expenditures on software likely also posted a solid advance in the fourth
quarter.13
Outside the high-tech area, shipments of equipment declined in November for
the third straight month, and the October-November average was more than
1 percent below the third-quarter average. Given the low but positive rate of
price inflation for such traditional equipment, the drop in nominal outlays
translates into an even larger decline in real terms. In addition, orders for
non-high-tech equipment fell in October and November.
With more complete data available, we estimate that real expenditures for
transportation equipment decelerated markedly in the fourth quarter. In
particular, we think that real spending on motor vehicles fell at an annual rate of
nearly 40 percent last quarter, the third consecutive quarterly decline. Although
unit sales of medium and heavy trucks, which constitute the bulk of motor
vehicle equipment investment, posted a strong gain in December, sales were
down about 40 percent (annual rate) for the fourth quarter as a whole.14
Elsewhere in the transportation category, spending on civilian aircraft by
domestic businesses-a volatile series owing to the lumpy nature of aircraft
deliveries-likely declined a bit last quarter. The nominal value of shipments of
domestically produced civilian aircraft declined in October and November
(based on Census data), and deliveries by Boeing to U.S. carriers were off
sharply, after seasonal adjustment, in December.
Nonresidential construction. Nominal spending on nonresidential
construction continued to increase robustly in October and November, averaging
15-1/2 percent (annual rate) more than in the third quarter.
13. Monthly shipments data are a key element in the BEA's quarterly NIPA estimates of
spending for most categories of equipment expenditures. However, comparable shipments data
for software do not exist. Instead, about one-third of total software spending (the so-called
"own-account" piece) is assumed to increase at the same rate as nominal computer hardware.
The remaining two-thirds (the so-called "prepackaged" and "custom" software pieces) are
benchmarked each summer to annual data from the Census Service Annual Survey; the latest
available data from this survey are from 1998. Subsequent quarterly estimates are based on an
eight-quarter moving average of the rate of increase of unpublished unemployment insurance
wage data for the prepackaged and custom software industries. The UI data are available only
with a two-quarter lag. In the interim, the BEA assumes these wages rise at the rate they
averaged during several previous quarters. This procedure has produced strong gains in nominal
software spending over the past few quarters, and because the long averages of wage data change
slowly over time, the NIPA estimates of software spending in the fourth quarter and subsequent
few quarters will increase substantially-even if actual software spending were to be subdued.
14. Spending for motor vehicles has been the most consistently cyclical category of
equipment and software spending over the past thirty years, generally declining in the quarter
before a business cycle peak and in the peak quarter itself.

After having increased rapidly earlier last year, spending for office construction
settled back to an annual rate of increase of 3-1/2 percent in October and
November from the third-quarter level. Construction spending for other
commercial structures (which include retail space and warehouses) picked up in
October and November to an annual rate of increase of 8-1/4 percent, which
partly reversed their decline over the second and third quarters of last year.
Outlays for industrial buildings continued to increase rapidly in October and
November, jumping at an annual rate of 55-1/2 percent, on average, from the
third-quarter level. Strong gains in industrial building throughout last year more
than reversed a string of declines from late 1998 through the end of 1999 that
reflected lower demand for U.S. exports owing to the Asian financial crisis.
Conditions in financial markets have remained generally favorable for
nonresidential construction. Issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) was well maintained in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, over
the second half of last year, yields on AAA-rated CMBS fell to the lowest level
since mid-1999, and their spread relative to the ten-year swap rate was about flat
last year. The spread for below-investment-grade (BB rated) CMBS edged up in
the latter part of 2000 from its low last June, but it still was below its level at the
end of 1999. Delinquency rates on CMBS remained low through November.15
Nonetheless, commercial banks have taken a more cautious approach to
commercial real estate lending in recent months. In the senior loan officer
opinion survey for the three months ended in mid-January, the net proportion of
large domestic banks that reported having tightened their credit standards for
commercial mortgage loans was 45 percent, compared with 26 percent in the
November sampling. This finding is consistent with an early January survey of
commercial mortgage lenders and borrowers that found that commercial banks
have been requiring substantial pre-leasing of space and more equity investment
as a condition for approving construction loans in recent months. In addition,
over the past year, three-fourths of the large domestic banks in the survey
reported having tightened their terms on commercial real estate loans.16
Almost all of these banks cited a less favorable economic outlook as one of
the reasons; in contrast, only three-fourths of them mentioned a worsening
outlook for commercial real estate within their market area as a reason for
tightening.
15. We do not have any timely information for delinquencies on commercial mortgages held
by life insurance companies or commercial banks; these rates stayed low through the third
quarter (latest data).
16. About half of them reported requiring a wider spread of loan rates relative to the cost of
funds, 40 percent required higher debt coverage ratios, and 30 percent reported reducing the
maximum loan size or the maximum maturity.

Government Expenditures
Federal government. According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the
federal budget surplus for the October-December period totaled $2 billion, after
adjustment for shifts in payment timing. The federal government recorded an
$8-1/2 billion deficit, after such adjustments, during the same period last year.
After adjustment for routine shifts in the timing of payments, outlays in the
October-December period rose only 2 percent relative to last year. Spending on
agriculture programs was $6 billion lower than 1999 levels, which were elevated
by emergency payments; in 2000, these payments were disbursed in August and
September. Defense spending was also down slightly from its 1999 level, which
had been boosted by outlays for Y2K preparations. Spending on health
programs was pushed up significantly by recent cost increases.
Total receipts rose 4 percent during the October-December period. Even though
withheld income and payroll taxes in calendar year 2000 were up 8 percent from
1999, comparable tax withholdings from October through December were
4 percent higher than in the same months of 1999. This deceleration reflects not
only slower wage gains but also shifts in income and tax payments from January
2000 to December 1999 owing to Y2K concerns, and from December 2000 to
January 2001, because of an anticipation of reductions in tax rates that may be
made retroactive to the beginning of the year. Other receipts fell 9 percent,
owing to the Federal Reserve's decision to withhold earnings deposits in order
to rebuild its surplus. According to the Daily Treasury Statement, non-withheld
income tax receipts for January 2001 are expected to increase roughly
10 percent over last January.
The outgoing Administration released new baseline budget projections on
January 16. The federal unified budget surplus was projected to rise slowly,
from $236 billion recorded in fiscal 2000 to $256 billion in fiscal 2001. The on-
budget surplus, which excludes social security and the Postal Service, was
forecast to expand from $86 billion to $98 billion. In fiscal 2002, the on-budget
surplus is expected to edge up, to $104 billion, if the annual appropriations for
discretionary spending rise with inflation.
For the fiscal 2002 to 2011 period, the OMB projected the total budget surplus
to be $5 trillion, with a cumulative on-budget surplus of $2.4 trillion and net

debt held by the public eliminated during fiscal 2009.17 Budget surpluses were
revised up a relatively small amount since last summer. At that time, the on-
budget surplus over the 2001 to 2010 period-which has been the basis of
policy discussions-was projected to total $1.9 trillion. The most recent
estimates call for it to reach $2.1 trillion, as upward revisions to receipts
reflecting higher estimates for potential GDP growth have been partially offset
by upward revisions to outlays owing in part to last fall's budget legislation.
State and local governments. Indicators of state and local activity suggest that
real purchases increased moderately again in the fourth quarter. The level of
employment was, on balance, unchanged during the quarter. Although real
construction spending fell in both October and November, average spending
during the two months was still above the third-quarter level. However,
December's unusually severe weather makes it unlikely that construction
spending rebounded that month.
On the fiscal side, recent surveys indicate that budgetary conditions for states
appear to be generally less rosy than in recent years, and analysts are
increasingly calling attention to signs of impending fiscal difficulties for some
states. Most of the problems appear to be related to slower revenue flows and
rising health-care costs. Among the states experiencing slower increases in
revenues, some blame recent tax reductions while others point to sluggish state
economies. Notably, fewer states than in recent years are expected to consider
tax cuts during their upcoming legislative sessions. In addition, 23 states
reported cost overruns for Medicaid owing to rising prescription drug costs,
increased caseloads, higher enrollment because of outreach projects under the
State Children's Health Insurance Program, and higher medical service costs,
especially for long-term care.
Prices
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in December, the same as in the
previous month. Over 2000 as a whole, the CPI was up 3.4 percent, about
3/4 percentage point more than in the preceding year, with core prices
accounting for more than half of this acceleration.18 That said, the CPI
excluding food and energy rose just 0.1 percent in December, and the
17. The projections are based on the OMB's economic assumptions that during the next ten
years, real GDP will increase at an average rate of about 3.0 percent per year, the unemployment
rate will move up slowly to about 5 percent, and CPI inflation will move up to about
2-3/4 percent per year. The CBO projections are expected to be released around January 31.
According to the Senate Budget Committee, these projections will increase the cumulative
ten-year total budget surplus to $5.7 trillion, up from $4.6 trillion forecast last July.
18. As we have noted previously, the December 1998 run-up in tobacco prices no longer
affects comparisons of the most recent twelve-month change with that of the year-earlier period.
Thus, the pickup in the twelve-month changes ending in December in the core index and the core
excluding tobacco are similar.

underlying rate of change in this index appears to have stabilized in recent
months. On a current-methods basis, the twelve-month change in the core CPI
was 2.5 percent in each month from August through December; this pace is
0.4 percentage point above that registered in 1999.
Retail energy price inflation was mild in November and December-masking
sizable swings within the components of the energy category. Crude oil prices,
although volatile from week to week, have fallen, on balance, from their
November highs, contributing to a corresponding decline in the price of gasoline
last month. Although wholesale prices for heating oil have likewise declined in
recent months, retail prices have moved up somewhat, sharply boosting
retailers' margins.
Supply-demand balances in natural gas markets have been tightening for the
past year, but dangerously so over the past two months. Spot prices of gas at
Henry Hub rose from $2.50 per million Btu in December 1999 to about $5 per
million Btu by October of last year, and prices surged to more than $9 per
million Btu through the first half of January, before falling to about $7 over the
past week or so. The CPI for natural gas rose 4.4 percent in December and was
up nearly 37 percent over the past twelve months. Thus far, only about half of
the increase in the cost of natural gas appears to have been passed through to the
consumer level; indeed, spot and futures quotes for gas suggest another surge in
the CPI for natural gas in January.
Higher prices of natural gas have raised the cost of generating electricity
nationwide-the primary reason for December's 0.5 percent increase in retail
electricity prices.19 Further increases in the electricity CPI are likely in January,
for the same reason. In addition, the spectacular problems of California's
"deregulated" electricity market are expected to boost the nationwide CPI for
electricity this month; residential rates in California rose between 7 and
10 percent in early January.20 Although costs of electricity generation there
have increased markedly with higher natural gas prices, the broader underlying
problem is insufficient generating capacity to meet the rising demand.
Retail food prices bulged 0.5 percent in December-boosted by sizable
increases in many categories-after having posted no change in November.
19. Both the CPI and the PPI for electricity are calculated from typical residential electric
charges. However, the two indexes differ in timing and coverage. In particular, the PPI reflects
prices early in the month, rather than the full month, and uses a smaller sample of distributing
utilities. In addition, there are two intermediate-goods PPIs for electricity-one for the
commercial sector and one for the industrial sector. These indexes also are end-user price
measures, capturing prices paid by commercial and industrial users of electricity.
20. California has a weight of roughly 8 percent in the nationwide electricity index, and thus
such an increase would boost the CPI for electricity by about 3/4 percentage point.

Over the past twelve months, the CPI for food has risen 2.8 percent, about
1 percentage point more than in the year-earlier period; however, the increase
over the past year is only a little above the pace in the core CPI.
The CPI for core commodities declined 0.2 percent in December, pulled down
by a decrease in tobacco prices.21 Over the past twelve months, prices of core
commodities have risen 0.6 percent-about 1/2 percentage point more than in
the year-earlier period-reflecting faster inflation rates for durable goods.
Computer prices fell a little less rapidly in 2000 than in 1999, and prices of
motor vehicles accelerated. Most of the acceleration in prices for vehicles was
the result of more rapid rates of increase for used cars, although new vehicle
prices were flat in 2000 after having declined slightly in 1999.
The CPI for non-energy services increased 0.1 percent last month, held down by
a drop in the volatile index for lodging-away-from-home.22 In contrast to the
decline in that component of shelter, owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent
were up 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent in December respectively. During 2000,
prices of non-energy services climbed 3.4 percent, noticeably above their pace
of 2.7 percent in the previous year.23 Faster rates of increase in medical
services, shelter, and a variety of other items contributed to this pickup.
PCE prices are available only through November, and in that month, core PCE
prices rose 0.2 percent.24 In November, the twelve-month change in the core
was 1.7 percent, just 0.1 percentage point above its rate in the preceding year.
That slight pickup in core PCE inflation is less than that in the core CPI (on a
current-methods basis) over the comparable period. As we have mentioned in
previous Greenbooks, this pattern largely reflects two factors. First, the non-
market components of PCE-which are not included in the CPI-decelerated
over the past year. Second, differences in the source data used to measure
21. According to the BLS, the 3.5 percent decrease in tobacco prices last month reflected
discounting on major brands of cigarettes. The dropback in December was somewhat surprising
because wholesale prices for cigarettes increased 14 cents per pack in mid-December, in time to
have a partial effect on the CPI for that month. Although the wholesale price rise was offset last
month, that increase is likely to pass through to the retail level in the coming months.
22. The U.S. Postal Service increased rates on January 7. Given the small weight of postage
in the CPI, the increase in rates will have a minimal effect on the CPI for non-energy services.
23. As we have reported previously, last year the BLS corrected a programming error that
affected owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent. Although numbers for both 1999 and 2000
were affected by the error, the BLS corrected figures only for 2000. Because of this
discontinuity, the amount of acceleration in non-energy service prices over the past year is
overstated in the published figures by about 1/4 percentage point.
24. In its final GDP release for the third quarter, BEA revised down core PCE prices to an
annual rate of increase of 1.1 percent, compared with a previously reported increase of
1.5 percent. Much of that revision was concentrated in the erratic index for bank imputed
service charges, reflecting Call Report data from the FDIC that the BEA receives only in time for
the final GDP release.

certain prices-particularly for medical care services-held down the
acceleration in core PCE prices relative to that in the CPI.
In terms of capital goods, the PPI for that category increased 0.2 percent in
December following no change in November. Over the past year, the rate of
increase in capital goods prices has picked up about 1 percentage point, owing
to faster rates of increase for a range of items, including light trucks, civilian
aircraft, oil and gas field equipment, and machine tools. In addition, computer
prices did not fall as rapidly during 2000 as they did in 1999. However, with the
softening in demand for computers and other high-tech products at the end of
last year, prices appear poised to decline more rapidly; indeed, the PPI for
computers posted a substantial 2 percent decline in December. The PPI for
applications software-which is used as source data for estimating real pre-
packaged software spending in the NIPAs-has been erratic recently.
Following a sharp rise in early 2000, prices have dropped back considerably in
the past two months, suggesting a flattening of the trend.25
At earlier stages of processing, prices have been mixed since the time of the last
Greenbook. Although the Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials
prices was up 1.5 percent-with higher prices registered for steel scrap and
some petroleum products-prices of some other metals, textiles, and some forest
products have moved lower.
Inflation expectations have remained subdued. The median response to the
Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations was 3.0 percent in
early January, about the same as the rate that prevailed last year. Longer-term
expectations-as measured by the five- to ten-year median expectations-were
3.0 percent in this month's preliminary survey, similar to the pace registered in
recent quarters.
Labor Costs
Compensation per hour, as measured by the ECI, rose at an annual rate of
3.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Although this series can be volatile on a
quarterly basis, the increase last quarter was noticeably below the pace
registered earlier last year. Wages and salaries were also up at a 3.0 percent rate
25. Interpreting the recent movements in the PPI for applications software is complicated by
the somewhat bizarre four-month lagged revision procedure used by the BLS for the PPI.
Consider the revisions last month. With the release of the December figures, the BLS revised
the level of the PPI down in August (four months earlier) to reflect late reports from companies.
In addition, the December PPI was set at its best level, reflecting the new information
incorporated for August. However, because the BLS does not adjust the levels of the
intervening months-September, October, and November-the pattern of monthly percent
changes for recent months is confounded. Although this revision procedure is used for every
component of the PPI, its effects are particularly acute for software prices because revisions tend
to be large in that component.

last quarter, held down by small increases in manufacturing and in finance,
insurance, and real estate (FIRE), where commissions can swing widely. In
both of these areas, weakness in activity likely contributed to the step-down in
wage gains. Benefits rose at a 3.6 percent rate last quarter following larger
increases in the past several quarters.26 Health insurance costs rose at a
6 percent rate, and nonproduction bonuses were up at a 3-3/4 percent rate.
Over the twelve months ending in December, the ECI for hourly compensation
increased 4.4 percent, up 1 percentage point from a year ago. For wages and
salaries, last year's increase was 3.9 percent, about 1/2 percentage point above
that in 1999. In recent years, changes in overall wages and salaries have been
heavily influenced by swings in the FIRE component that were related to the
wave of mortgage refinancings in 1998. Excluding FIRE, the trends in wages
and salaries are somewhat smoother in recent years, and twelve-month changes
in this category appear to have moderated in the past couple of quarters.
Benefits were up 5.6 percent in 2000, pushed up by faster rates of increase for
most major components of benefits than in 1999. Given cost pressures on health
care, available evidence suggests further sizable increases in this category of
benefits in 2001.27
Although other compensation measures accelerated more in the fourth quarter
than did the ECI, the various measures of compensation all showed a similar
pattern of acceleration between 1999 and 2000. Average hourly earnings of
production or nonsupervisory workers-which increased 0.4 percent in
December and 0.6 percent in November-were up 4.2 percent over the twelve
months ending in December, about 3/4 percentage point above their pace in
1999. Although fourth-quarter data for the Productivity and Cost measure of
compensation per hour are not yet available, we estimate that P&C hourly
compensation rose at an annual rate of 6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter and
5-1/2 percent over the past year, compared with an increase of 4-3/4 percent in
1999.28
26. With the exception of health insurance, benefits detail is unpublished and is provided to
us by the BLS on a confidential basis.
27. A recent survey by Mercer/Foster-Higgins points to faster rates of increase in
health-benefits costs this year than seen last year. Towers-Perrin expects to release its survey of
health-benefits costs next week.
28. Our projection for fourth-quarter P&C hourly compensation reflects information on
average hourly earnings through December and the monthly readings on wage and salary income
from the NIPAs through November.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Short- and intermediate-term Treasury yields posted sizable declines in the two
weeks following the December FOMC meeting. The Committee's shift in the
balance-of-risks statement to concerns about economic weakness, along with
incoming data that indicated deteriorating economic conditions, led to
heightened expectations of a near-term easing in monetary policy. That
sentiment was reinforced by a spate of negative corporate earnings warnings
around year-end.
Although most market participants had come to expect an intermeeting policy
easing, few anticipated the timing and the size of the 50 basis point reduction in
the federal funds rate on January 3. The aggressive action by the FOMC led to
expectations of further policy easing and a subsequent rebound in economic
growth, which contributed to a recovery in equity prices and some unwinding of
the flight to quality that had been holding down long-term Treasury yields. On
balance, over the intermeeting period, the Treasury yield curve steepened, with
rates on the two-year note falling about 52 basis points and ten- and thirty-year
yields rising 16 basis points and 23 basis points respectively. Most major
equity indexes have moved higher, on net, since the December FOMC meeting,
with the largest advances posted by the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the small-cap
Russell 2000.
Yields on Treasury inflation-indexed securities declined appreciably, implying a
substantial fall in real rates. Current readings from the futures markets suggest
that market participants are placing high odds on another 50 basis point
reduction in the intended funds rate at the January meeting, and another 75 basis
points or more by year-end. Still, options prices continue to suggest substantial
uncertainty about the timing of future policy actions.
Market conditions for business financing have been mixed over the intermeeting
period. Junk bond spreads have retraced about half of their rise over the latter
part of 2000, and issuance has revived in recent weeks. Investment-grade bond
issuance remains robust. In contrast, the commercial paper market has been
shaken by the defaults of two California utilities. Quality spreads have widened
considerably in recent days, and investors are even reluctant to acquire the paper
of some top-tier issuers. Some businesses facing resistance in commercial paper
markets met their financing needs by tapping banks. However, bank loan
officers, generally responding to concerns about prospects for the economy,
report that they are continuing to tighten standards and terms for business
borrowers, including the cost of credit lines.
In the household sector, the drop in mortgage rates prompted a surge in
refinancing applications, while the decline in light vehicle purchases and
sluggish retail sales held down consumer credit growth. Meanwhile, bank loan

officers reported that they have begun to tighten standards for consumer loans,
though there is little evidence that households are experiencing greater problems
servicing their debt.
The federal government continued to outpace its own expectations for the
paydown of Treasury debt. In contrast, a steady pace of tax-exempt bonds to
finance new capital buoyed offerings in the state and local sector.
Business Finance
Equity analysts made hefty cuts to their estimates of fourth-quarter corporate
profits in response to the continued stream of earnings warnings announced in
December and early January. However, it appears that much of the bad earnings
news came out early, and most nonfinancial firms are now reporting earnings
that meet or exceed beaten-down forecasts, though by a smaller margin than has
become customary in recent years. Based on reports for about half of S&P 500
firms, we estimate that earnings per share in the fourth quarter fell about
2 percent for the S&P 500 as a whole from its year-earlier level.
Analysts have lowered their estimates of earnings for 2001 as well. Over the
past four weeks, year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were reduced by more
than 2-1/2 percentage points, to roughly 6 percent. Cuts to year-ahead earnings
in the past two months have been the largest such monthly adjustments since the
1990-91 recession.
With stock prices reacting to mostly negative earnings reports, gross public
equity issuance was a paltry $2 billion in December and dried up completely in
early January as a number of firms cancelled planned offerings. More recently,
issuance has shown signs of picking up; about $2 billion of stocks were
marketed after mid-January, with another $2 billion slated for issue by month-
end, including some IPOs. Venture capital, which grew rapidly through much
of last year, is estimated to have slowed in December, and anecdotal reports
suggest that private equity investors remain cautious.
Equity retirements from mergers of domestic firms spiked to about $50 billion
in December, boosting the fourth-quarter total, as a backlog of previously
announced deals was completed. Announcements of new mergers have
continued at an elevated pace, suggesting that merger-related retirements will
remain sizable. In contrast, announcements of share repurchases in the fourth
quarter remained well below the average pace of recent years, which might be
expected with the slump in corporate profits.
Weaker earnings prospects and rising debt contributed to further deterioration in
credit quality measures for nonfinancial corporations in December. Moody's
downgraded $140 billion of bonds (thirty-nine issues) in December and

upgraded $20 billion (eleven issues). Daimler-Chrysler and Xerox accounted
for about $100 billion of the downgrades. For 2000 as a whole, the debt of
downgraded firms exceeded that of upgraded firms by a margin of two to one.
The rate of junk bond defaults was about 6 percent in 2000, up substantially
from 1999 but below the levels recorded during the early 1990s.
In mid-January, the debt of the California utilities, PG&E and Southern
California Edison, was downgraded to junk status. These firms defaulted on
some of their bonds and commercial paper after midmonth because revenues
from regulated retail rates have not been sufficient to meet higher wholesale
energy prices. The defaults have had few spillover effects in the bond market,
but they have contributed to skittishness among commercial paper investors.
Spreads of thirty-day A2/P2 paper over A1/P1 paper have ballooned to more
than 80 basis points in recent days. Commercial paper outstanding contracted
sharply in January, and new issues were concentrated at shorter maturities as
investors remain extremely reluctant to buy longer-term issues of even top tier
firms.
Gross bond offerings in December totaled nearly $20 billion, in line with the
monthly average in 2000. Issuance picked up smartly in January and is on track
to post the highest monthly total since May 1999. Although all offerings in
December were from investment-grade companies, the junk bond market has
shown renewed vigor since the intermeeting rate cut. So far in January, a
handful of junk-rated telecom and high-tech companies have issued more than
$6-1/2 billion dollars, eclipsing the total amount issued in November and
December combined.
In the commercial mortgage market, yields on AAA-rated commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) declined over the intermeeting period in
step with rates on comparable ten-year swaps, leaving spreads in line with those
of the past two years. CMBS issuance in the fourth quarter was above the
average pace of the first three quarters of last year, but issuance for 2000 as a
whole was about 20 percent below that of 1999. Growth of commercial
mortgage debt from all sources is estimated to have slowed further to an annual
rate of about 6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter. While available data show that
delinquency rates on commercial mortgages remain at historically low levels,
bank loan officers report that they continue to tighten standards for such loans.
Household Finance
The value of household assets relative to disposable income continued to decline
in the fourth quarter, owing to the drop in equity prices, and has now retraced
about a quarter of the run-up since 1995. Available data indicate that household
debt growth remained brisk in the fourth quarter, with the 8-1/4 percent pace
just under the 8-3/4 percent registered for the year as a whole. Strong demand
for home mortgages, at least partially attributable to earlier declines in mortgage

rates, offset a further decline in the growth of consumer credit, which is
estimated to have slowed to a 6-1/2 percent rate-down from 8 percent in the
third quarter.
Measures of household credit quality have been mixed, but they do not suggest
significant deterioration. Credit card delinquency rates have edged up a bit
recently, while delinquency rates on auto loans at finance companies are about
unchanged at low levels. Preliminary calculations suggest that the household
debt service burden continued to increase in the fourth quarter and was quite
close to its twenty-year high of 14-1/2 percent in 1986.
Meanwhile, the lower level of mortgage rates led to a spike in home mortgage
refinancing. The MBA refinancing index more than doubled in the first half of
January but dropped back some last week. As refinancing applications work
their way through the pipeline, reduced interest rates and longer maturities on
the new mortgages are expected to contribute to a flattening out of the debt
service burden.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury paid down about $27 billion in publicly held debt in the fourth
quarter, nearly $4 billion more than had been projected at the midquarter
refunding announcement. Buybacks thus far in January are about on pace to
meet the $9 billion total the Treasury targeted for the first quarter.
Measures of market liquidity provided mixed signals during the intermeeting
period. Bid-ask spreads on ten-, five-, and two-year notes spiked at the end of
the year but have since returned to levels that are only somewhat elevated.
Spreads between on- and off-the-run ten- and thirty-year Treasuries were stable
at levels that would not indicate unusually strong demand for liquidity, but the
spread for the five-year note was somewhat elevated.
Growth of agency debt remained robust over the intermeeting period. Freddie
Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banking System issued a combined $10 billion
in early January, and Fannie Mae priced about $3 billion in ten- and thirty-year
bonds on January 18. Freddie Mac projected that issuance of domestic
Reference notes and bonds in 2001 would total $90 billion, up from $58 billion
in 2000, and Fannie Mae estimated that 2001 Benchmark coupon issuance
would be at least $75 billion, compared with $77 billion last year.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross offerings of long-term debt by state and local governments totaled
roughly $15 billion in December, bringing the fourth-quarter pace to about
$17 billion per month, somewhat above the average for the previous three
quarters. As was the case for much of the year, issuance in December was

mainly for new capital. Yields on long-term municipal bonds have fallen about
15 to 25 basis points over the intermeeting period, slightly outperforming
corporate bonds of similar maturity, reflecting limited supply as well as the
strong credit quality of state and local governments. As a result, ratios of
municipal bond yields to AAA corporate bonds continued to move lower.
While the financial problems at PG&E and Southern California Edison,
investor-owned utilities in California, have had little impact on municipal utility
debt yields, California's general obligation bonds have been put on watch for a
possible downgrade. There is considerable uncertainty about how the situation
in California will be resolved, but most proposals under consideration involve
the state's issuing debt. The latest proposal receiving attention would allow the
utilities limited ability to raise rates to pay off outstanding obligations. A state
agency would be established that would issue revenue bonds and use the
proceeds to purchase power under long-term contracts. The utilities would act
as agents, distributing electricity and collecting monthly payments for the state.
Bank Credit and Money
Growth in bank credit bounced back in December. The advance, in part, owed
to a jump in holdings of securities, which rose at a 17 percent annual rate, the
first increase in five months. Business lending also perked up, following three
months of little or no growth. Most of the rise in business loans occurred at
large domestic banks and foreign institutions during the week of December 20
and coincided with a large decline in outstanding nonfinancial commercial
paper, suggesting that lower-rated commercial paper issuers may have been
drawing down bank lines. Growth in business loans has remained strong in
January, perhaps owing in part to instability in the commercial paper market.
Growth of consumer loans originated by banks also rose last month. A pickup
in credit card loans accounted for the increase and was offset in part by a decline
in the growth of other consumer loans, likely reflecting slowing motor vehicle
sales. Growth of real estate loans at banks slipped some in December and
remained well below the increase for the year as a whole. The deceleration
owed partly to increased securitization of loans for one- to four-family
properties by large banks. In the January Senior Loan Officer Survey, a number
of domestic commercial banks reported tightening terms and standards on
consumer loans, but there was no reported change in standards on residential
mortgage loans.
The broad monetary aggregates surged in December and January after weak
growth in October and November.1 M3 growth was boosted by brisk issuance

fund the expansion of bank credit and to replace their reduced borrowing from
overseas affiliates. Institutional money funds grew rapidly as well. The decline
in short-term market interest rates enhanced the attractiveness of these funds,
whose rates lag movements in market rates.
M2 was lifted in part by the narrowing of its opportunity cost. Higher demands
for liquidity in the face of elevated volatility in equity markets likely also
boosted this aggregate. Retail money funds and liquid deposits (the sum of
checking and savings accounts) both picked up substantially. Small time
deposits continued to expand at a fairly rapid clip. Currency growth increased
notably but is still subdued by the standards of the 1990s.
The financial position of banks showed some noticeable deterioration in the
fourth quarter. Published reports for twenty-one large bank holding companies
indicate that their net income fell about 17 percent on average relative to the
fourth quarter of 1999, reflecting depressed earnings from equity investments
and substantial loss provisioning against nonperforming assets. Overall, loss
provisions and net charge-offs rose 70 and 30 percent, respectively, from the
year-earlier level, and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and
leases rose 20 percent.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The January 2001 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. Supplementary questions addressed the effect
on borrowers of the reported tightening of lending standards and terms on C&I loans
over the past year or so, changes in terms on commercial real estate loans over the past
twelve months, banks' expectations about changes in standards on consumer loans over
the next year, and banks' leasing operations. Loan officers from fifty-seven large
domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
participated in the survey.
The number of domestic and foreign banking institutions that reported tightening
standards and terms on C&I loans over the past three months remained large.
Significant fractions of both domestic and foreign banks also tightened standards for
commercial real estate loans. In general, banks indicated that the most important
reasons for tightening standards and terms were a worsening economic outlook and a
reduced tolerance for risk. On net, a substantial fraction of respondents reported
weaker demand over the past three months for both C&I loans and commercial real
estate loans.
On the consumer side, lending conditions also firmed noticeably. A much larger
fraction of domestic banks than in the November survey reported tightening standards
and terms on non-credit-card consumer loans. On net, about 15 percent of the banks
indicated that they anticipate some tightening in their standards and terms on all types
of consumer loans before the end of 2001. In addition, 35 percent, on net, indicated
that demand for all types of consumer loans had weakened somewhat in the last three
months. However, almost all domestic banks reported no change in standards for
residential mortgage loans and, on net, demand for residential mortgages was also
unchanged.
Lending to Businesses
The net percentage of domestic and foreign respondents that tightened standards during
the last quarter was even higher than the elevated level in the November survey.
Almost 60 percent of domestic banks reported tightening their standards on C&I loans
to large and middle-market firms over the past three months, and 45 percent reported
tightening standards to small firms over the same period. As in the November survey,
about 80 percent of branches and agencies of foreign banks reported tightening
standards for customers seeking C&I loans.
Large fractions of domestic banks reported tightening each of the loan terms listed in
the survey. Almost three-quarters of domestic respondents reported charging higher
premiums on riskier loans to large and middle-market firms, including 21 percent that
claimed to have increased these premiums considerably. No banks reported lowering
premiums. About half of the domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had tightened
loan covenants and raised the cost of credit lines for large and middle-market firms over
the past three months. Nearly 60 percent of domestic banks, on net, increased the
spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for these borrowers. Overall, somewhat

III-A-2
smaller fractions of domestic banks tightened terms on C&I loans to small firms. Still,
premiums on riskier loans to small firms increased at almost 60 percent of domestic
banks, and 42 percent of the respondents tightened covenants on loans to small firms.
Two-thirds of the branches and agencies of foreign banks reported charging somewhat
higher premiums on riskier loans, and an additional 17 percent increased these
premiums considerably. Three-fourths of foreign institutions increased spreads of loan
rates over their cost of funds, and 58 percent indicated a general strengthening of loan
covenants. No foreign bank reported easing any of the terms listed in the survey.
Most of the domestic and foreign respondents that had tightened standards or terms on
C&I loans cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of
industry-specific problems, and a reduced tolerance for risk as reasons for changing
their lending policies. About three-fourths of domestic and foreign banks that had
tightened standards and terms on commercial credits over the past three months also
mentioned an increase in defaults by below-investment-grade borrowers as important,
and many cited decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans as well.
The January survey included a special question to determine how banks' business
customers responded to the general tightening of lending standards and terms that has
been reported over the past year. Domestic banks indicated that about two-thirds of
their customers borrowed as planned despite the stricter lending policies; for foreign
institutions that share was about 50 percent. Of those customers that did not borrow as
much as planned, both domestic and foreign banks reported that more than half were
able to finance their spending plans either by borrowing elsewhere or by using liquid
assets. Well under one-fifth of customers reduced spending plans, and only a handful
canceled their plans altogether.
On net, about half of domestic banks reported decreased demand for C&I loans from
large and middle-market firms, and 30 percent, on net, reported moderately weaker
demand from small firms over the same period. Most of the domestic banks that
reported weaker loan demand cited a decline in customer demand for credit to finance
capital expenditures and reduced demand for financing mergers and acquisitions. A
shortage of internally generated funds and increased need for inventory financing were
cited as important reasons by the few domestic banks that experienced increased
demand. Two large banks noted that they received increased demand from customers
that had switched to bank loans from the commercial paper market.
On net, about 20 percent of foreign branches and agencies saw weaker demand over the
past three months. A decline in customers' need for merger and acquisition financing
was cited as an important reason by most of the banks that saw demand decrease, and a
majority also mentioned that their customers had reduced spending on plant and
equipment. Each of the four foreign banks that saw increased demand for C&I loans
reported that customers shifted to bank loans because either the commercial paper
market or other credit sources became less attractive.
More than 40 percent of domestic banks tightened standards on commercial real estate
loans over the past three months, up from 26 percent in the November survey. The
fraction of branches and agencies that tightened standards on these loans in the current

III-A-3
survey, about 30 percent, was little changed from November. On net, almost 30 percent
of domestic banks and 15 percent of foreign banks reported at least somewhat weaker
demand for commercial real estate loans.
In response to a special question, significant fractions of both foreign and domestic
banks indicated that they had tightened terms on commercial real estate loans over the
past year. Most strikingly, about half of the domestic banks increased spreads of loan
rates over their cost of funds, and about 40 percent demanded higher debt-service
coverage ratios. More than 50 percent of the foreign institutions increased spreads over
their cost of funds. Significant fractions of foreign banks also tightened their
requirements for take-out financing, demanded higher loan-to-value ratios, and raised
debt-service coverage ratios.
A less favorable economic outlook was the most important reason for tightening terms
on commercial real estate loans at both domestic and foreign banks. Foreign banks also
expressed significant concern about the availability of take-out financing, followed
closely by a reduced tolerance for risk. The latter was the second most important
reason in the minds of domestic banks that tightened terms. Interestingly, for both
domestic and foreign banks, the number of respondents mentioning as an important
factor a worsening of the outlook for commercial real estate in the market where they
operate was slightly smaller than the number mentioning general economic weakness.
Lending to Households
Over the past three months, banks' credit standards for approving residential mortgage
loans were largely unchanged. Changes in demand for residential mortgages were
highly variable across respondents, with 30 percent reporting stronger demand and an
equal fraction reporting weakness. In the November survey, about 33 percent of banks,
on net, reported weaker demand for home mortgages.
A few banks indicated that they were less willing to make consumer installment loans
than they were three months ago, and more than 10 percent of banks tightened
standards on credit card loans. For other types of consumer loans, almost 20 percent of
domestic banks reported tighter standards, and about 25 percent increased spreads.
Relative to recent surveys, this represents a significant increase in the number of banks
tightening standards and terms for non-credit-card consumer loans. About 15 percent
of banks, on net, expect to tighten their standards and terms on all types of consumer
loans before the end of 2001, even if the economy expands at a sustainable rate. In
addition, almost 35 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported that demand for all
types of consumer loans had weakened over the past three months, compared with only
13 percent that observed weaker demand in the November survey.
Bank Leasing Operations
Lease financing has been expanding rapidly at domestic commercial banks since the
late 1990s. The January survey asked three special questions designed to elicit
information on the composition of leases at banks and on the reasons that leases have
grown over that period. Banks reported that more than 60 percent of their leases are
made to nonfinancial corporations and also indicated that this category was the primary
area of growth in lease financing over the past several years. The rise in lease financing

III-A-4
has accompanied rapid expansion in the types of capital investment for which lease
financing is commonly used. Acquisitions of leases from third parties and a more
competitive leasing market were also mentioned as important factors in the growth of
these assets at domestic banks. Almost a third of the leases held by banks are consumer
leases, which several banks noted are primarily auto leases. However, two banks
indicated that they are exiting consumer leasing.

The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $33.0 billion in November,
somewhat smaller than recorded in the previous two months. Nonetheless, for
October-November combined the deficit was $17 billion (a.r.) larger than in the
third quarter.

In November, the value of exports of goods and services declined for the third
consecutive month, with decreases primarily in computers, semiconductors, and
automotive products. For October-November, the value of exports declined 4-1/2
percent at an annual rate from the third-quarter average. The decline was spread
among computers, semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, aircraft,
automotive products, consumer goods, and agricultural products. Exports of
industrial supplies and other machinery rose a bit.
Imports in November declined for the second consecutive month which together
nearly reversed the sharp run-up recorded in September. For October-
November, the value of imports was slightly higher than the third-quarter
average. Increases in imported consumer goods, aircraft, telecommunications
equipment and other machinery were nearly offset by declines in imported
automotive products, computers, semiconductors, and industrial supplies
(largely chemicals and steel). The value of oil was about the same in October-
November (at an annual rate) as in the third quarter, as a drop in quantity was
offset by an increase in price.

Oil Prices
Dollars per barrel
Spot West Texas Intermediate

IV-5
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The price of imported oil (BLS) declined over 9 percent in December
following two months of smaller changes. In spite of intermittent disruptions to
Iraqi oil exports, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate fell nearly $6 per
barrel during December in the wake of moderating concerns about low
inventories and high demand. Through mid-January, however, oil prices
generally moved higher in advance of OPEC's decision to cut oil production
targets 1.5 million barrels per day. Spot WTI is currently trading near $31 per
barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods rose 0.9 percent in
December, following a small decline in November. The monthly increase (the
largest recorded since these data began in 1989) was driven by a 4.1 percent rise
in the prices of imported industrial supplies, reflecting primarily a surge in the
price of natural gas. Prices of most other imported core goods (which exclude
oil, computers, and semiconductors) either declined in December (consumer
goods) or were unchanged (automotive products and machinery). For the fourth
quarter, prices of both non-oil and core goods imports rose, but at a somewhat
slower pace than recorded over the past four quarters -- core goods by 1/2 percent
at an annual rate and non-oil imports by 1 percent (a.r.) Most major trade
categories registered price declines in the fourth quarter, with the notable
exception of industrial supplies.
Exports. Prices of total U.S. goods exports declined slightly in December as
increases in the prices of exported agricultural products (for the fourth
consecutive month) were more than offset by declines in the prices of most other
exported goods. For the fourth quarter, the prices of exported core goods (which
exclude computers, semiconductors, and agricultural products) fell slightly--the
first decline since the fourth quarter of 1998--as decreases in the prices of
exported consumer goods and industrial supplies outweighed increases prices of
exported machinery. Prices of exported computers and semiconductors both
declined in the fourth quarter.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private-sector demand for U.S. securities remained strong in November
(line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table), as foreign
purchases of corporate and agency securities far outpaced net sales of Treasury
securities. Through November, year-to-date net foreign purchases of agency
bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate stocks were all at record annual levels.
Demand for agency bonds has been noteworthy. November marked the fourth
straight month of record net purchases of agency bonds, with demand from
Japan being particularly strong.

IV-6
The sustained demand for agency and corporate securities contrasts with net
sales of Treasury securities, related in part to the ongoing paydown of securities
issued by the Treasury given the federal budget surplus. In 1999, private-sector
foreigners were net sellers of Treasuries for the first year since 1990. The selling
continued in 2000 and, barring substantial net purchases in December, the fourth
quarter will be the fifth straight quarter of net sales of Treasuries by private
foreigners. Despite the net sales during 1999 and 2000, private foreigners'
holdings of Treasuries as a share of total outstanding has changed little over the
period, indicating that they appear to have responded to the changing yield
differential between Treasuries and alternative debt instruments in a manner
similar to the market as a whole.
In November, net sales of foreign stocks and bonds by U.S. residents (lines 5a
and 5b) more than offset the acquisition of foreign stocks through stock swaps
(line 5c). The net sales of foreign bonds were mostly through Europe, where
U.S. residents have been acquiring bonds. The net sales of foreign stocks were
mostly through Hong Kong and Japan.
Although our measures of the sources and destinations of capital flows are
imperfect, the November data are consistent with an apparent shift in portfolios
away from Japan and towards Europe. Through November, U.S. residents
acquired on net about $65 billion in European securities, mostly through bond
purchases and acquisitions of stocks through merger-related swaps. In contrast,
on net U.S. residents sold $20 billion in Japanese securities, following large net
purchases of Japanese stocks in 1999.
Foreign official assets held in the United States fell slightly in November after a
small increase in October (line 1). The largest decline was recorded for Turkey
($4 billion), in conjunction with its banking crisis; FRBNY data for December
suggest that Turkey's reserves have since stabilized. A large decrease was also
recorded for Germany ($3 billion), almost offsetting a large increase in October.
Sizable declines were also recorded for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Russia's
reserves increased substantially ($3 billion) in November and have increased $15
billion for the year. A sizable increase was also recorded for China. As has
been the case all year, reported increases in reserve assets held in the United
States by OPEC countries were modest in November. Partial data from FRBNY
indicate that in December foreign official reserves held in the United States
increased $12 billion.
Modest inflows through banking offices in the United States were reported in
November (line 3), following large inflows in October.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The exchange value of the dollar has changed little, on balance, against the
major currencies since the December FOMC meeting, as a 2 1/2 percent
depreciation against the euro was counterbalanced by an appreciation of
4 1/4 percent against the yen. Right after the FOMC's surprise 50 basis point rate
cut, it was difficult to discern what the longer-term impact of the policy action
on the exchange value of the dollar against the euro and yen would be. While
the dollar appreciated against the euro and depreciated against the yen in the
immediate aftermath of the announcement, these moves were largely reversed
the following day. However, within a few days of the rate cut market
participants became more confident that the downside risks for the U.S.
economy were moderate, and the major currencies index of the exchange value
of the dollar recovered its earlier losses.

October November December January
Recent economic data suggesting that the growth rate of the U.S. economy is
moderating more rapidly than that of the European economy appears to have
helped revive the fortunes of the euro at the end of last year. In contrast, the
downward revisions in growth expectations for Japan have been quite modest
compared to the change in assessment of U.S. growth prospects. One factor
behind the yen's weakness may be market perceptions that the Japanese
government wants a weaker currency, to help generate an export-led recovery.
Further adding to negative sentiment towards the yen was the announcement by
Toyota that it would reduce the rate at which it repatriates its foreign earnings;

IV-9
market participants opined that other large Japanese exporters were likely to
follow suit.
In comparison to the dollar's sharp fluctuations against the euro and yen, the
dollar's movements against other major currencies were moderate. On net, the
U.S. dollar depreciated 3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar and 1/4 percent
versus the Australian dollar over the intermeeting period. From the December
FOMC meeting to January 3, the U.S. dollar had depreciated by much larger
amounts against the Canadian and Australian currencies, but in the period
following the FOMC policy action, the U.S. dollar recovered most of its losses.
Over the intermeeting period the dollar appreciated 1 percent, on balance,
against sterling. With recent economic data suggesting the rate of growth may
also be slowing more rapidly in the United Kingdom than in the euro area,
sterling has moved more in line with the dollar than the euro since the December
FOMC meeting.
The exchange value of the dollar rose 1 percent versus the currencies of our
other important trading partners over the intermeeting period, owing primarily to
a 3-1/4 percent appreciation against the Mexican peso and a 5 percent
appreciation versus the Korean won. Market participants expressed concern that
Mexico and the emerging Asian economies would be hardest hit by a slowing of
the U.S. economy, as they export heavily to the United States. The Philippines
peso was extremely volatile over the intermeeting period, as the twists and turns
in the fate of President Estrada were reflected in the Philippines currency. On
balance, the dollar depreciated 3-1/4 percent against the Philippines peso, as
market participants appeared relieved by the change in regime.
Canadian three-month interest rates moved lower after the FOMC's January 3
policy action, as the market brought forward its expected time frame for the
Bank of Canada to begin easing. These expectations were realized on
January 23, when the Bank of Canada cut its key policy rate 25 basis points.
Since the December FOMC meeting, Canadian three-month rates have declined
32 basis points, but the yield on the Canadian ten-year bond has risen 17 basis
points. Share prices in Canada rose over 6 percent. Short-term rates in the euro
area declined 15 basis points, while rates in Japan have slipped even further
from their already low level. Yields on other major industrial country ten-year
sovereign bonds have changed relatively little since the December FOMC, with
the exception of the yield on the ten-year Japanese government bond, which fell
25 basis points. Share prices in Japan declined almost 5 percent on net;
discussions by Japanese government officials on undertaking "price-keeping
operations" seemed to help reverse initially larger losses.

Share prices in the emerging market economies in Asia, led by the
semiconductor manufacturing companies, rebounded smartly following the
FOMC's January 3 policy action, gaining 16 to 25 percent over the intermeeting
period. The apparent end to the political uncertainty in the Philippines helped
equities gain 20 percent. Share prices in Latin America also recorded strong
gains during the intermeeting period, ranging from 14 to 31 percent, with the
sharpest upward movement occurring shortly after the FOMC's January 3 rate
cut. Short-term interest rates in Argentina were dramatically lower, as the
FOMC's rate cut and an earlier IMF loan agreement improved sentiment
towards Argentina. The yield spread of Argentine and Brazilian Brady bond
debt over U.S. Treasuries also narrowed substantially.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent information suggests the rate of expansion of activity moderated in major
foreign industrial countries in the fourth quarter. Euro-area data, although mixed
across economies, indicate growth continued to slow. The pace of the Canadian
expansion is estimated to have moderated, largely due to weaker exports to the
United States. Growth in the United Kingdom seems to have declined to a rate
closer to trend, while the Japanese economy seems to have stagnated.
Continued high oil prices kept broad measures of inflation near their recent
peaks in December, but core inflation remained relatively subdued. Twelve-
month consumer price inflation in the euro area was 2.6 percent, well above the
European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling, although core inflation
(excluding food and energy prices) remained below 1-1/2 percent. Canadian
consumer price inflation breached the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent
to 3 percent inflation target band, while core inflation was 1.9 percent. In the
United Kingdom, retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments
remained below the 2-1/2 percent target rate. Japanese consumer price deflation
persisted at 1 percent.
In Japan, economic activity appears to have stagnated once again. The all-
industry index of output, which includes both industrial production and
indicators of activity in the service, construction, and public sectors was down
about 1/2 percent on average in October and November relative to the third
quarter. Industrial production and service sector output were little changed from
their third-quarter levels, but weakness was evident in the construction industry
where output was down about 3 percent. On the demand side, the household
sector remains sluggish; partial fourth-quarter data on real household
expenditures and car registrations suggest that consumer spending may have
fallen in the fourth quarter after having been little changed over the preceding
half-year. Housing starts were also below their third-quarter level on average in
October and November following two quarters of decline. Even private
nonresidential investment, which has been the strongest component in the
tentative expansion so far, appears to be losing steam, as growth of both orders
and shipments of machinery slowed sharply in the fall following robust increases
earlier in the year.
Signals from the labor market are mixed. The unemployment rate rose by one-
tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent in November, just below the record
high of 4.9 percent reached early last year. However, employment expanded for
a second consecutive month, while an increase in job seekers boosted the ranks
of the unemployed. Meanwhile, the job-offers-to-applicants ratio continued to
edge up, to 0.65 percent, the highest level in almost three years. The high

IV-13
unemployment rate reportedly reflects the impact of corporate restructuring and
the increasing mismatch between skills needed and those possessed by older
laid-off workers.
Concern over deflation has re-ignited. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo
area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) declined 1 percent in
December from a year earlier, compared with a decline of 1/2 percent in 1999.
Twelve-month changes in wholesale prices for domestic goods have been
slightly negative in the past three months after having been boosted for several
months by the runup in energy prices. Land prices also have continued to fall in
the third quarter of 2000; the national urban land price index fell 6-1/4 percent
below its year-earlier level.

The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) for the first eleven
months of 2000 was $104 billion (s.a.a.r.), down from $109 billion in the same
period last year, with exports up 16 percent and imports up 23 percent. The
developing Asian countries have continued to account for most of the export
gain, although demand from those countries softened in the latter part of the
year, while higher oil prices have contributed significantly to the increase in
dollar-denominated imports.
Despite the weakness in the economy, the substantial government debt burden is
becoming an increasingly important constraint on fiscal policy. The Japanese
cabinet has approved a draft budget for FY2001 which is contractionary even
compared with last year's initial budget. When last year's supplemental budget
is included, the year-over-year decline in fiscal spending, in the absence of a
further supplemental budget, would be about 8 percent (nearly 1-1/2 percent of
GDP), including a substantial decline in public works spending.
The rate of economic growth in the euro area continued to slow in the fourth
quarter. Most of the slowdown is apparent in Germany, where industrial
production was down 0.9 percent in October/November from the third quarter
average owing to weak manufacturing activity. However, for the euro area
overall, industrial production rose 0.8 percent in October/November from the
third quarter average. Additionally, the euro-area purchasing managers' survey
continued to indicate an overall expansion in manufacturing activity, but moved
down for the eighth consecutive month in December, dropping to its lowest level
since June 1999. Retail sales declined in the euro area overall in October;
German sales recorded their third monthly decline in November. However, in
France, consumption of manufactured goods rebounded in the fourth quarter to
be up 1/2 percent over the third quarter.
Business confidence in the euro area appears to have stabilized in recent months,
while consumer confidence improved in December, bolstered by receding oil
prices. Continued improvements in labor market conditions have also helped
raise consumer confidence. In Germany, the December unemployment rate
declined for the ninth consecutive month to 9.2 percent, while in Italy the
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter fell to 10 percent from 10-1/2 percent in
the third quarter.
Declining oil prices in December also helped contain consumer price inflation.
Euro area consumer prices were unchanged (s.a.) in December from the previous
month, and the 12-month rate of inflation fell to 2.6 percent (n.s.a.) but still
remained above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling. Core
consumer prices (which exclude food and energy prices) rose a modest 0.1
percent in December, leaving the 12-month rate of core inflation unchanged at

IV-15
1.4 percent. Preliminary German and Italian CPI data for January indicate that
inflation has picked up, primarily reflecting higher food prices. Euro area labor
costs also rose a modest 0.9 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter of last year, down
slightly from a 1 percent increase in the second quarter.

Fourth-quarter data suggest that the pace of expansion of economic activity
slowed in the United Kingdom. Industrial production in October and
November on average was down 0.7 percent from the third-quarter level, growth
in the volume of retail sales moderated over the fourth quarter, and consumer
confidence remained low. On the up side, business sentiment rose in the fourth
quarter and again in January; however, these numbers remain below the levels
recorded in 1999.

Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment
rate remained at 3.6 percent in December, the lowest rate in 25 years. However,
average annual earnings growth in November remained below the 4/2 percent
rate that the Bank of England believes to be compatible with the inflation target.
Producer input prices have been rising sharply, in part reflecting higher oil
prices. Nevertheless, the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest payments) remains below the 2/2 percent target, as price
discounting has continued in the goods sector.
In Canada, indicators available for the fourth quarter suggest that economic
activity continued to expand at a solid pace, although weak external demand and
softening consumption slowed growth from earlier in the year. Real GDP,
measured at factor cost, rose 6.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in October. A broad-based
advance in manufacturing production, particularly in the electronics sector, and
continued gains in business services drove the strong growth. However, data on
merchandise trade and manufacturing shipments suggest that, outside of the
energy sector, manufacturing activity failed to expand in November. In addition,
new orders for manufactured goods fell in November, while inventories

IV-17
expanded rapidly. Consumption activity also showed signs of slowing, as
November retail sales were unchanged from October in real terms and housing
starts contracted in the fourth quarter.
Labor markets displayed continued strength, with employment rising a stronger-
than-expected 3.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter. For the year,
employment increased 2.6 percent, slightly below the pace of the previous two
years. The unemployment rate was 6.8 percent in December, unchanged from
the beginning of the year, as labor force participation rates rose along with
employment.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation remained steady at 3.2
percent in December, above the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to
3 percent target range. Higher energy prices continued to account for much of
the increase in consumer prices, as the twelve-month core rate of inflation
(which excludes food and energy prices) was a more moderate 1.9 percent in
December. However, core inflation is now markedly higher than the I/2 percent
rate recorded throughout much of 2000. On the other hand, wage increases have
moderated, with average hourly earnings rising 3.2 percent in the twelve months
ending in December, down from growth close to 4 percent earlier in the year.

IV-18
The Bank of Canada announced on December 20 that David Dodge, the former
Deputy Minister of Finance and the current Deputy Minister of Health Canada,
would serve as the next Governor of the Bank of Canada, replacing Gordon
Thiessen. Governor Thiessen will retire from the Bank on January 31.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Data received since the last Greenbook have reinforced our perception that
growth is slowing in the major developing countries. In Latin America, the
evidence is largely concentrated in Mexico, where industrial production posted
declines in recent months. The slowdown in growth in Asia is more widespread,
with the exception of China. Inflation pressures have remained generally
subdued across the developing economies, and prices have continued to decrease
in Argentina and Hong Kong. Developing country exports appear to have fallen
off recently, in part reflecting weaker U.S. growth and a slowdown in global
electronics demand, resulting in declining trade balances in Mexico and in some
Asian economies.
In Mexico, the latest monthly indicators point to a slowing in the rate of
economic growth. Industrial production fell 1.6 percent (s.a.) in November--the
second consecutive monthly decline. In addition, partly due to reduced U.S.
demand for Mexican goods, the trade deficit widened to nearly $14 billion in the
fourth quarter, bringing the 2000 deficit to $8.2 billion from a $5.4 billion deficit
in 1999.

Inflation in 2000 came in at 9.0 percent, well below the Bank of Mexico's
(BOM) 10 percent target. However, BOM's target of 6.5 percent inflation for
2001 is generally considered to be ambitious. Already this year, the BOM has
tightened monetary policy, responding to survey expectations of 2001 inflation
that were running over a percentage point higher than the target.
In late December, the Mexican congress approved the 2001 fiscal budget. The
passage of the budget, by near consensus, before the year-end deadline, and
through the politically divided Congress, represents a victory for the Fox
government. In order to persuade lawmakers to pass the budget before the
deadline, the government agreed to widen the budget deficit to 0.65 percent of
GDP from the original proposal of 0.5 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the
approved budget should narrow the deficit relative to the estimated 2000 deficit
of 1.1 percent of GDP and represents significant fiscal tightening, especially
given expectations of lower output growth and a sizable decline in oil prices. In
addition, if government revenues fall between one and five percent below
budgeted revenues, the government is authorized to cut expenditures without
prior approval from Congress in order to achieve the budget deficit target.
In Argentina, economic data since the last Greenbook were mixed, while
financial market conditions improved markedly after the FOMC's policy easing
on January 3. GDP fell 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, reflecting a large
decline in investment. For the fourth quarter, however, industrial production
showed signs of improvement--rising 1-1/2 percent. Nevertheless, the level of
prices was about percent below its year-earlier level. Export growth remained
robust through November while imports fell more than 5 percent from a year
ago, with notable declines in capital goods imports. Early indicators for January
are more encouraging. January consumer confidence rebounded to levels not
seen since mid-2000, although still well below the end-1999 level. In addition,
private sector bank deposits jumped to a three-month high (n.s.a.) in early
January, making up much of the ground lost in the last quarter of 2000.
In mid-December, the Argentine government formally announced the details of
an IMF-led assistance package. The total amount of the three-year package is
nearly $40 billion--about $14 billion from the IMF, $5 billion from the World
Bank and IADB, $1 billion from Spain, and the remaining $20 billion from
private sector sources. Before year-end, Argentina drew $2 billion in IMF funds
available under its previous stand-by arrangement that was subsumed in the new
program. Argentina accessed another $3 billion in IMF funds in mid-January
following the approval of the new, enlarged stand-by program by the IMF
Executive Board. The announcement of the package, the surprise intermeeting
rate cut by the FOMC, and the final IMF approval all contributed to improving
financial market conditions in Argentina. Since mid-December, the Argentine

IV-23
stock market has risen about 25 percent, spreads on Argentine sovereign bonds
have fallen almost 150 basis points, and domestic interest rates on 30-day peso
deposits have declined around 875 basis points.

In Brazil, recent evidence points to continued strong economic activity, although
there are hints of some deceleration in the fourth quarter. Industrial production
edged down in November, after a 1.7 percent (s.a.) increase in October. The
unemployment rate was stable in November and the level of employment has
been basically flat since September. Consumer price inflation (as measured by
the IPC-A index) ended the year at 6 percent, down from nearly 9 percent in
1999, despite large increases in fuel prices.
On January 17, the Brazilian central bank's monetary policy committee lowered
its benchmark Selic rate 50 basis points to 15-1/4 percent and retained its neutral
bias on future moves. This action puts the Selic at its lowest level since the real
was created in 1994. It was the second month in a row that the central bank
eased rates, taking advantage of falling U.S. interest rates and low domestic
inflation.

In late December, Brazil's congress approved the 2001 federal government
budget. The budget calls for a primary (non-interest) surplus consistent with a
primary (non-interest) surplus for the entire public sector of 3 percent of GDP,
down from about 3% percent of GDP in 2000. In January, S&P raised its credit
rating for the Brazilian government's long-term foreign-currency debt from B+
to BB-, citing Brazil's improved fiscal and monetary performance, including the
congressional approval of the federal government budget. Also in January, the
Brazilian federal government launched five- and ten-year bond issues totaling
$2.5 billion.
In Venezuela, output growth rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and upward
revisions in previous quarterly figures point to a 5.6 percent growth rate over the
four quarters ended 2000Q4. Last year's recovery primarily reflects strength in
the oil-related and public sectors. Inflation over the twelve months ended
December was 13.3 percent--the lowest annual inflation figure in almost fifteen
years. Strong oil revenues led to a $13.4 billion (1212 percent of GDP) current
account balance in 2000.

In Korea, recent data suggest a marked slackening in growth during the fourth
quarter. Industrial production declined for the third consecutive month in
November, with production of office machinery and automobiles especially
weak; semiconductor production was about flat, a sharp contrast to the rapid
increases earlier in the year. Most data on business fixed investment also stayed
weak in November, with investment in facilities dropping particularly sharply.
Near-term growth prospects appear to have weakened due to a recent buildup in
inventories. The inventory-to-shipments ratio rose for the fourth consecutive
month in November, reaching its highest level in nineteen months. The central
bank kept its policy rate unchanged at its latest meeting in early January.
However, there is a general expectation of a reduction in rates in the fairly near
future.
In what may mark a significant setback for market-based corporate reform, the
government recently announced that, acting through the government-owned and
operated Korea Development Bank, it would buy up to 20 trillion won (about
$16 billion) of corporate bonds of "viable" but ailing companies. The purchases
will initially target three affiliates of the troubled Hyundai conglomerate, most
notably Hyundai Engineering and Construction, that have appeared to be on the
verge of financial failure. Since the collapse of Daewoo in late 1999, the
government has pressured commercial banks to buy corporate bonds, which they
would not otherwise have purchased, by creating several bond funds in which

IV-26
the banks were required to participate. However, this is the first time that the
government will be directly purchasing and guaranteeing bonds of private
companies.

In the ASEAN region, the economic expansion showed further signs of
deceleration. Third-quarter real GDP fell in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand,
while growth moderated in Singapore and the Philippines. More recently,
production numbers from the fourth quarter indicated further slowing in parts of
the region. Export performance also appeared to have weakened over the past
few months. Inflation continued to be a problem in Indonesia and the
Philippines, but remains subdued in the rest of the region.
The political problems that have plagued Thailand, the Philippines, and
Indonesia continued to pose substantial risks. In Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra
was elected Prime Minister and was almost simultaneously indicted on
corruption charges. If found guilty, he could be removed from office. Even if
he remains in office, there is concern over how he can fund the populist
proposals he campaigned on without causing the fiscal deficit to balloon from its
current level of roughly 5 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, Philippine President
Estrada resigned on January 20, and Vice President Arroyo was sworn in as
president. This followed the mass resignation of Estrada's cabinet and the
withdrawal of support of Philippine military leaders from Estrada. In Indonesia,
formal hearings have begun on two scandals involving President Wahid that
could result in his impeachment.

China continued to register robust economic growth, supported by substantial
government spending and rising consumption expenditures. Real GDP rose
7-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, taking the year-over-year growth rate
for 2000 to 8 percent. Recent statements from various government officials
indicate that the government expects the economy to expand at a similar rate this
year, despite a projected slowdown in exports. Exports slumped sharply (s.a.) in
December as global demand softened. However, an even larger decline in
imports--particularly intermediate goods imports--resulted in a widening of the
trade surplus. Inflation remained low, although the twelve-month inflation rate
continued to edge up and hit a three-year high of 1-1/2 percent in December.
According to government figures, China's industrial firms (including state-
owned enterprises) recorded profits of $45 billion in the first eleven months of
last year, up 92 percent compared with the same period in 1999. The figures
prompted the government to declare that it had met its 1997 target of turning
around most ailing state-owned enterprises within three years. Analysts
generally agree that part of the improved performance last year was due to
continued lay-offs as a result of restructuring and higher revenues reflecting
stronger economic activity. Some of the profit increases likely also reflected
reductions in interest payments (for example, because of lower interest rates and
debt-equity swaps).

In Hong Kong, recent indicators point to an abrupt drop off in growth. Exports
fell almost 9 percent (s.a.) in November and likely declined further in December,
judging from China's poor trade performance last month. Real retail sales were
down roughly 3 percent (s.a.) in the October-November period compared with
their third-quarter average, as high real interest rates and uncertainties in the
stock and property markets continued to weigh on consumer confidence.
Nonetheless, the unemployment rate edged down to 41/2 percent (s.a.) and the
twelve-month rate of decline in consumer prices eased in the fourth quarter. The
Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut interest rates 50 basis points in early
January, matching the FOMC's move.
In Taiwan, indicators suggest that growth may have turned negative in the
fourth quarter as the slowdown in global electronics demand depressed exports.
Exports, which had been a key engine of growth earlier in the year, rose
22 percent in 2000 as a whole, but fell about 4 percent (s.a) in the fourth quarter.
Domestic demand also appeared to weaken in the fourth quarter, as evidenced by
significantly lower imports of consumer goods and capital equipment. Other
signs of retrenchment included a 4.9 percent fall (s.a.) in industrial production in
December and an increase in the unemployment rate. In the face of waning
domestic demand, the inflation rate moved down to 1.7 percent in December. In
late December, Taiwan's central bank cut interest rates 12'/2 basis points.
