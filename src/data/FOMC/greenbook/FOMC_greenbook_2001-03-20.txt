Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economy appears to have registered a small gain this quarter. Consumer
spending, especially on motor vehicles, has held up better than might have been
expected given the decline in the stock market and the sharp downturn in
consumer confidence. In addition, construction has expanded further, buoyed
by low interest rates. Business spending on equipment appears likely to reverse
at least some of its fourth-quarter decline; but a stream of downbeat news about
sales and earnings, especially among high-tech firms, suggests that this rebound
could be short-lived. Moreover, the latest inventory data still point to
appreciable stock imbalances. As a result, the manufacturing sector remains
especially weak, with further cutbacks in production in train this quarter. Core
inflation has edged up.
Labor Market Developments
The pace of private-sector hiring was relatively well maintained in January and
February. Although employment declined in manufacturing and related
industries, this was more than offset by moderate gains elsewhere. The
unemployment rate edged up to 4.2 percent early this year.
Private nonfarm payrolls rose 98,000 in February, similar to the average
monthly gain since the start of the fourth quarter but well below that seen during
the first nine months of last year.1,2 As in recent months, the weakness in
February was concentrated in the manufacturing sector: Over the past two
months, manufacturing has shed 190,000 workers, and since October, factory
employment has dropped at an average rate of 52,000 per month. Employment
in industries with strong ties to manufacturing, such as help-supply and
wholesale trade, has also turned down in recent months. In addition, the
widespread layoff announcements in the telecommunications sector are
beginning to show through to payroll growth. For providers of
telecommunications services, employment was flat in the first two months of
this year after having grown almost 4 percent in 2000. Employment at
telecommunications equipment producers dropped 2 percent in first two months
of 2001 (not at an annual rate); this was the largest two-month decline in this
industry during the current expansion, with the exception of 1998, the year of
the Asian crisis.
1. The BLS reports that the 2000 benchmark adjustment will increase the level of total
nonfarm employment for the March 2000 reference month by 469,000. The BLS will introduce
the revised data in the May employment report.
2. As we noted in the last Greenbook, the BLS's bias adjustment for employment growth at
very young establishments (which are not included in the payroll survey sample) more than
accounts for the rise in private payrolls since the third quarter of last year.

In contrast, hiring in other sectors has, thus far, continued apace. Employment
outside of manufacturing, wholesale trade, and help-supply has increased about
180,000 per month since October, similar to the average for the first nine
months of 2000. Most recently, construction employment rose another 16,000
in February after having shot up 158,000 the month before, and services
employment excluding help-supply has expanded 120,000 per month so far this
quarter, a bit more than its average pace in 2000.
Aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm
private payrolls fell 0.5 percent in February after having risen 0.8 percent in
January; the January-February average stood 0.5 percent (at an annual rate)
above the fourth-quarter level.3 The workweek has also fluctuated in recent
months, but on net it has fallen about 1/4 hour from its average level in the third
quarter of last year. Similar to the employment picture, the shortening of the
workweek has occurred mainly in the manufacturing sector; February's level of
40.6 hours was nearly an hour below the average workweek in the third quarter.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2 percent in
February, after having risen 0.2 percentage point in January. The number of job
losers unemployed for less than five weeks-a proxy for the layoff rate-has
risen in each of the past two months, and in February it stood at its highest level
since 1996. Employment in the household survey fell 184,000 in February, but
since October this measure has increased at an average rate of 100,000 per
month, in line with employment growth in the payroll survey.4
Other indicators mirror the employment data, portraying a still-tight labor
market in which demand has begun to soften. Initial claims for unemployment
insurance have turned up again in recent weeks, averaging around 370,000 for
the two-week period ending March 3. In addition, the most recent readings on
net hiring strength from Manpower and the National Federation of Independent
Businesses (NFIB) point to a slowing in the pace of hiring. Firms also have
indicated some lifting of supply constraints in line with the rise in the
3. The large increase in January reflected a bounceback in the average workweek from a
level in December that was depressed by the occurrence of severe winter storms during the
survey week.
4. The Census Bureau recently released preliminary estimates of the undercount for the 2000
Census. Although the estimated undercount was smaller than in 1990, much of the improvement
occurred in the under 18 years of age category, suggesting that the undercount for the working-
age population (16 and over) may have been similar to the undercount in 1990. Although the
Administration has decided not to adjust for the undercount when using the Census for
redistricting purposes, our assumption is that the BLS will include an undercount adjustment
when it updates the population controls in the Current Population Survey. As a result, we have
not altered our view that a significant part of the gap between household and payroll employment
growth that emerged over the 1990s will disappear when the BLS incorporates the new Census
data.

unemployment rate; the NFIB reported that the percentage of positions that
were hard to fill fell in December and January before moving up slightly in
February, although a recent survey by the Bureau of National Affairs indicated
that it remained difficult to hire technical and professional workers at the
beginning of the first quarter.
Growth in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector slowed during the
second half of last year as the economy cooled, but even so it remained at
relatively elevated rates compared with the pre-1995 experience.5 Productivity
is now reported to have increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, after having risen 3.0 percent in the third quarter. Over the four
quarters of 2000, output per hour increased 3.4 percent, down slightly from the
3.8 percent rate registered in 1999 but still a percentage point higher than the
average from 1996 to 1998.
Industrial Production
Aggregate hours worked in the manufacturing sector fell sharply in February,
suggesting that industrial production dropped for a fifth consecutive month. IP
continues to be held back by slower growth in the high-tech sector and, more
broadly, by excess inventories that have accumulated in the face of slackening
demand for U.S.-produced goods. Available physical product data point to a
decline in mining and utility production last month as well.
Motor vehicle assemblies were about 10.4 million units (annual rate) in both
January and February, down about 10 percent (not at an annual rate) from the
level in the fourth quarter. Combined with a pickup in sales, this reduction in
production resulted in sharp drops in inventories. Stocks fell about 130,000
units in January and 160,000 units in February, and the days' supply for the
industry moved down to about 60 days in February. Nonetheless, several
automakers, most notably General Motors and Ford, are still experiencing
significant inventory overhangs, and while current schedules call for assemblies
of 11.4 million units in March and 12 million units in the second quarter (annual
rate), we expect production to fall short of scheduled rates. Indeed, some of the
automakers have already hinted that they plan to trim production schedules for
the second quarter.
High-tech industries have continued to struggle in recent weeks. Excessive
stocks of semiconductors began accumulating at computer and communications
equipment producers toward the end of last year, and according to industry
analysts, the slowing in sales of PCs, cell phones, and equipment purchased by
5. Published data on output per hour for nonfinancial corporations in the fourth quarter are
not yet available.

telecom service providers is beginning to damp chip production noticeably.6 In
addition, a number of high-tech firms have announced layoffs and plant
closings. For example, Intel and Cisco recently announced that they would cut
jobs, and Motorola announced that it would lay off another 7,000 workers in its
cell-phone division and close a semiconductor plant currently employing 4,000
workers. Many of these producers have also slashed capital spending plans for
this year.7
Manufacturing IP outside of the transportation and high-tech industries, which
began to contract in the third quarter of last year, continues to be weak. The
6. Weakening demand continues to put downward pressure on spot prices for memory
chips, although recent declines were not nearly so steep as in October and November of last year.
Most recently, Dataquest reports that spot prices picked up slightly the week of March 9, in
response to rumors of a possible closure of a Hyundai semiconductor plant in Eugene, Oregon.
7. Dataquest predicts that North American capital spending by semiconductor producers
will be flat this year in nominal terms. However, the Semiconductor Industry Association
forecasts a 10 percent nominal decline relative to last year. Additionally, Semiconductor
Equipment and Materials International reports that January shipments of equipment used to
manufacture and assemble semiconductors outstripped new orders by nearly 20 percent; as a
result, the semiconductor equipment book-to-bill ratio, which peaked in August, fell to 0.81 in
January, its lowest reading since 1998.

inventory situation in many of these industries appears to have worsened in
January, and firms have reacted to these imbalances by cutting factory
hours-and presumably production-further in February. Part of the
accumulation occurred in industries producing inputs to motor vehicles, but
imbalances have also persisted in industries hit hard by the intensification of
import competition last year, such as lumber and wood products, paper and
allied products, and fabricated metal products. In addition, real adjusted durable
goods orders continued to fall on a three-month moving average basis, while the
NAPM new orders diffusion index was nearly as negative in February as in
January, when it fell to its lowest reading in ten years.
Consumer Spending and Income
Consumer spending appears to have advanced at a moderate pace this quarter.
Sales of light motor vehicles to households-normally a very sensitive indicator
of household demand-have rebounded some. However, consumer confidence
has deteriorated, and balance sheets and income gains continue to erode.
Adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, sales of new light vehicles have
averaged 17 million units (annual rate) so far this quarter, up from 16.3 million
units in the fourth quarter. Some of this strength reportedly reflected an
acceleration of fleet deliveries. However, retail sales have also moved up
noticeably since the end of last year. In January, this step-up may have been,

in part, to make up for sales deferred from a weather-related lull in December,
while in February, consumers apparently responded strongly to sweetened
incentives offered by General Motors and Chrysler. These recent incentive
programs came as a bit of a surprise to us, given these firms' statements at the
beginning of the year that incentives would be scaled back because of
disappointing profits. However, pressed by nagging concerns about
inventories and market shares, they once again resorted to increasing
incentives. All of Chrysler's and some of GM's most recent incentive
programs are currently scheduled to extend through early April.
Nominal sales in the retail control category fell 0.4 percent in February after
having surged 1.3 percent in January.8 Following large gains in January, sales
fell sharply at eating and drinking establishments and at outlets selling furniture
and appliances and "other durable goods," which include toys, books, jewelry,
sporting goods, and photographic equipment. In contrast, nominal outlays rose
modestly last month at apparel, food, and general merchandise stores. Taken
together, the retail sales data and available estimates of consumer prices indicate
that real outlays for goods excluding motor vehicles increased 0.8 percent in
January but declined 0.5 percent in February; the average level of real
expenditures in January and February was 3-1/4 percent (annual rate) above the
fourth quarter.
Data on services expenditures are available only through January. Real
spending on services fell 0.2 percent that month, held down by a sharp decline
in outlays for electricity and natural gas as temperatures returned to more
seasonal levels following unusually cold weather in November and December.9
Excluding energy, real purchases of services increased 0.2 percent in January,
reflecting higher expenditures for transportation, personal care, medical, and
recreational services. In contrast, real outlays for business services fell in
January, pulled down by a drop in spending for brokerage services.
Several important determinants of consumer spending weakened further early
this year. The ratio of net worth to disposable income will almost surely decline
again in the first quarter, as a result of a further drop in equity prices. In
addition, rising consumer prices, especially for energy, continued to weigh on
real disposable personal income, which rose only 1.9 percent over the twelve
months ended in January; the twelve-month change had held in the
neighborhood of 3 percent from early 1999 through the third quarter of last
8. The increase in nominal retail control in January was revised up 0.6 percentage point
from the advance estimate, reflecting higher spending in most of the major components of sales.
9. Temperatures in February were a bit warmer than average.

year.10 Meanwhile, consumer sentiment, as measured by both the Michigan and
Conference Board surveys, fell again in February, retreating to the lowest levels
since 1996. To some extent, the drop in sentiment likely reflects the downturn
in the stock market and the slower gains in real income. But the recent slide in
sentiment has been greater than these and other indicators would have
predicted.11
Details from the Michigan survey point to one additional factor that may be
behind the recent abrupt deterioration in this measure: Survey respondents have
increasingly mentioned "bad news about unemployment" when asked about
recent news they have heard regarding changes in business conditions.12
Indeed, after holding relatively steady for some time, the share of respondents
that reported hearing bad news about unemployment jumped to 49 percent in
February, the highest level since March 1992. As the measured unemployment
rate has moved up only a bit in recent months, respondents to the Michigan
survey may instead be reacting to reported layoff announcements, which have
become much more prevalent. Figures on layoff announcements compiled by
Challenger, Gray, and Christmas-which are regularly reported in the
press-surged 200 percent in December and remained at an elevated level in
January and February.13
Housing Markets
Housing construction rebounded in January. Total housing starts rose to an
annual rate of 1.65 million units, about 100,000 units above the average pace in
the fourth quarter of last year. The higher level of building was no doubt
spurred by the ongoing decline in mortgage rates; the rate on thirty-year fixed-
rate mortgages averaged slightly above 7 percent in January, 150 basis points
below the peak in May of last year.
Single-family starts rose 2-3/4 percent in January, to an annual rate of
1.34 million units. The level of starts in January was well aligned with adjusted
permits, which are less affected by weather and statistical quirks than are the
estimates of starts. Accordingly, the starts figure likely accurately represents
10. Data from the February employment report suggest a moderate increase in private wage
and salary income in that month.
11. Factors that we have found to be statistically useful for explaining movements in the
Michigan index of consumer sentiment include changes in the unemployment rate and stock
prices, the level of consumer price inflation, and the rate of growth of real income.
12. The survey asks, "During the last months, have you heard of any favorable or
unfavorable changes in business conditions? What did you hear?"
13. The Challenger data, which are compiled from newspaper reports, are subject to a
number of limitations as a measure of actual lost jobs. Notably, the data may include layoffs far
in the future that have little effect on current labor market conditions; they often include both
domestic layoffs and those overseas; and they encompass layoffs from all sources, including
attrition and retirement.

the underlying pace of activity. In the multifamily sector, housing starts
bounced back in January to an annual rate of 311,000 units. That increase offset
two-thirds of the drop in December and put starts at a level near the average for
the second half of last year.
Sales of new single-family homes fell nearly 11 percent in January, to an annual
rate of 921,000 units. However, that decline followed a surge in December, and
the pace of January sales was still quite robust by historical standards. Sales of
existing homes rose 3-3/4 percent in January, to an annual rate of 5.1 million
units.14 Sales in this category have not changed greatly on net since late 1999.
House price increases have been on an uptrend since late 1998. In the fourth
quarter of 2000, the constant-quality price index for new homes stood
6.1 percent above its level of a year earlier, and the repeat-sales price index for
existing homes was 8.1 percent higher than its year-earlier level.15 Both rates of
increase are toward the high end of the ranges recorded since the early 1980s.
Near-term indicators of housing demand remain relatively positive. The
Michigan Survey's measure of household perceptions of homebuying conditions
was unchanged in February but at a level toward the upper end of its range over
the past year. In the first two months of this year, households' increased
uneasiness about economic conditions has been offset by their view that
mortgage rates are low. By contrast, builders' ratings of new home sales had
retreated in recent months to a moderate level, but they were little changed in
February.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Against a backdrop of deteriorating
fundamentals-including a slowing economy and weaker profits-real
expenditures on equipment and software fell in the fourth quarter. Incoming
data on shipments and orders of nondefense capital goods, as well as the recent
14. The National Association of Realtors originally reported that existing home sales
declined 6.6 percent in January. Subsequently, the NAR staff discovered a data processing error
that had significantly understated sales in January 2001 (and in January and February 2000).
15. The monthly data on median and average home prices are more volatile than these
series, in part because they do not control for shifts in housing characteristics or for changes in
the geographic composition of homes sold. The constant-quality price index for new homes
adjusts for many of the compositional shifts that affect prices. The repeat-sales price index for
existing homes is relatively unaffected by compositional changes because it compares prices for
the same housing units over time. Fourth-quarter figures for the repeat-sales price index for
existing homes that we usually report were not available from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in
time for publication. Instead, we used a closely comparable repeat-sales price index published
by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that is based on the same source data as
the Fannie/Freddie series. The two series move together very closely.

pickup in motor vehicle sales, point to a small rise in real business spending in
the current quarter.
Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts,
fell 1/2 percent in January, on the heels of a decline in the fourth quarter.
Within the high-tech grouping, nominal shipments of office and computing
equipment changed little in January, and shipments of communications
equipment declined. Outside the high-tech area, nominal shipments edged up in
January, after having fallen 1 percent in the fourth quarter.
Orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts, moved up
5-1/2 percent in January, following a decline in the fourth quarter. Orders for
communications equipment posted an especially large increase in January;
orders rose substantially outside the high-tech area as well.16
Cutting through the volatility of the last few months, nominal orders and
shipments of both computing and communications equipment have flattened out
noticeably. Nevertheless, these nominal expenditures should still translate into
increases in real spending on high-tech equipment, given the rate at which
prices of these items are falling.17 Outside of the high-tech and transportation
areas, the recent orders and shipments data suggest that real spending on
equipment edged down early this year, after having declined at an annual rate of
about 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter.
16. The latest jump in orders for communications equipment contrasts with the widespread
anecdotal evidence of weakness in the high-tech sector, particularly telecommunications. This
tension has raised questions about the representativeness of the sample underlying the Census
monthly M3 report on orders and shipments in this sector. While there are general reasons for
concern about the quality of the M3 data-notably, they come from a voluntary survey, with
reported data representing only about 55 percent of total shipments in manufacturing-
discussions with Census Bureau staff suggest no special problems of coverage or reporting in
telecommunications. Reported data for telecommunications represent about 60 percent of
shipments.
17. As noted in the January Greenbook, monthly shipments data for software, the other
component of high-tech spending, do not exist. The BEA's standard methodology for estimating
nominal software spending in the NIPAs ties about one-third of the total (the so-called "own-
account" piece) to nominal outlays on computer hardware and the other two-thirds (the so-called
"prepackaged" and "custom" software pieces) to a slowly changing indicator of wages and
salaries. Because this indicator was consistent with strong growth, we had expected estimated
software outlays in the fourth quarter to increase substantially. On a confidential basis, the BEA
informed us that the fourth-quarter published estimate of software spending was about $5 billion
below the level implied by their standard methodology, reflecting their judgment-based in large
part on the weakness in other high-tech spending-that the wage indicator approach was
overstating the strength of software outlays.

Real spending on transportation equipment dropped at an annual rate of about
35 percent in the fourth quarter, led by reduced spending on aircraft and lower
sales of medium and heavy trucks. The nominal value of shipments of aircraft
rose in January to a level roughly equal to the average pace in the fourth quarter,
and deliveries by Boeing were up sharply in February after seasonal adjustment.
Meanwhile, real business spending on motor vehicles appears poised to post a
sizable gain this quarter. This gain reflects, in large part, the aforementioned
surge in fleet sales of light vehicles; sales of medium and heavy trucks, which
slumped badly over the latter half of 2000, remained depressed in January and
February, while new orders stayed at low levels after having plunged in the
fourth quarter.
Nonresidential construction. Investment in nonresidential structures
continued to rise smartly in early 2001. Nominal expenditures on private
nonresidential buildings jumped 5-3/4 percent in January (at a monthly rate),
one of the strongest increases in more than twenty years. Relative to the already
robust fourth-quarter level, expenditures in January were up 6-1/4 percent.
Nominal spending for construction of office buildings rose 1-1/2 percent in
January, to a level 23-1/2 percent higher than a year earlier. Even with the
rapid expansion in the stock of office space, property values and rents for
office buildings have increased substantially. In the fourth quarter of 2000,
the price per square foot of office property was up 11-1/2 percent from its
year-earlier level, while rents for office space located in downtown areas rose
12-3/4 percent over the same period.
Spending for other commercial structures, which include retail space and
warehouses, rose nearly 8 percent in January. At the same time, however,
financial problems at some large retailers led to bankruptcies and store
closings, raising concerns that some excess supply may be emerging for
certain types of retail space in selected locations. Indeed, values of retail
property were only 1-1/4 percent higher in the fourth quarter relative to a year
earlier, and rents were up less than 3 percent. Furthermore, demand for
warehouse space likely has softened along with the pace of consumer
spending on goods. Nevertheless, values of warehouse property were about
5 percent higher in the fourth quarter relative to a year earlier, while rents for
warehouse space were up roughly 4 percent.
Nominal outlays for industrial buildings rose nearly 11 percent in January,
offsetting a drop in December. The level of spending in January was
40 percent higher than a year earlier. Although this continued strength seems
inconsistent with the broad-based weakening in the manufacturing sector,
industry analysts report that sizable increases in construction expenditures
have taken place for certain types of specialized structures, such as research

and development facilities, that are included in overall spending on industrial
construction.
Despite the ongoing rise in construction expenditures, financial markets appear
to have become somewhat more cautious in their approach to funding new
construction projects. In the Senior Loan Officer Survey for the three months
ending in late January, the net proportion of large domestic banks that had
tightened their credit standards for commercial mortgage loans stood at
45 percent, compared with 26 percent in the November survey. In addition,
issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed
considerably in January and February, with industry observers citing greater
uncertainty about economic prospects as the primary source of increased
restraint. Despite these concerns, the rates paid by borrowers on CMBS have
edged down in recent weeks, and spreads relative to the ten-year swap rate have
edged up only a bit, suggesting little change in investors' view of the risk of
lending for commercial construction. Similarly, the delinquency rate on CMBS
remained very low late last year, as did delinquency rates on commercial
mortgages held by life insurance companies and on those held by commercial
banks.
Business Inventories
Stockbuilding in the nonfarm business sector (excluding motor vehicles)
decelerated sharply in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, inventories rose at a
faster pace than business final sales, and the inventory-sales ratio continued to
climb through year-end. The January inventory data provided further evidence
of stock overhangs early this year. Stocks appear especially bloated for
construction materials, metals, electrical equipment, paper, chemicals, and
textiles.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of
$38.7 billion in January, following an accumulation of $16.7 billion in the
fourth quarter. Shipments by manufacturers fell 1.1 percent in January, and the
inventory-shipments ratio moved up to 1.35 months, the highest reading in two
years. The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles fell at
an annual rate of $5.3 billion in January, following an accumulation of
$6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. However, sales at non-auto wholesalers edged
up only 0.1 percent in January, and the inventory-sales ratio was unchanged
from its December value. The book value of retail inventories excluding motor
vehicles increased at an annual rate of $13.9 billion in January, after an
accumulation of $15.8 billion in the fourth quarter. But with sales at non-auto
retailers having risen 1.3 percent in January, the inventory-sales ratio fell to 1.33
months in January, from 1.35 months in December.
Significant stock overhangs are evident in several sectors. In the case of
construction, inventory-sales ratios have been trending up sharply since early

and construction supplies, and retail building material and hardware supply
stores. Noticeable overhangs at various points in the distribution channel are
also increasingly apparent for electrical machinery, primary and fabricated
metals, paper products, and textiles. And while inventory-sales ratios for office
and computing machines are low by longer-term historical standards, they have
edged up recently. In contrast, downstream inventory-sales ratios in apparel and
industrial machinery do not appear to be at especially high levels.
Government Expenditures
Federal government. The federal government recorded a $76 billion surplus
during January 2001. Averaging through December-January timing shifts,
outlays were 5 percent higher in the two-month period ending in January 2001
than in the same period a year earlier. Receipts were 7 percent higher in
December and January relative to a year earlier. Non-withheld receipts were
up 10 percent in December and January from the year-earlier period,
continuing the strong uptrend in these receipts.
On February 28, the Bush Administration released its ten-year budget
projections and an outline of its proposals. According to the Administration, if
current policies were to remain in place, the unified budget surplus would total
$5.6 trillion over the 2002-11 period, consisting of $3 trillion in the on-budget
accounts and $2.6 trillion in the off-budget social security accounts. The
Administration's economic assumptions and the associated surplus estimates are
similar to the projections issued by CBO in January.
The President is proposing to use the social security surplus for net debt
reduction. A portion of the on-budget surplus would be used to fund tax cuts of
$1.6 trillion and a limited prescription drug benefit ($150 billion). Annual
increases in nominal discretionary outlays would be held to roughly 3 percent
after 2002, though outlays during 2002 would rise at a much faster 7 percent
rate due to prior year appropriations and a temporary boost to spending included
in the Administration's budget plan. The $842 billion that would remain after
the President's policies and the associated interest costs are taken into account
would be allocated to a contingency fund that could be used for additional
policy initiatives or net debt reduction.
On March 8, the U.S. House passed legislation to reduce marginal income tax
rates in line with the Administration's proposal. The legislation includes a
component that lowers the bottom rate for 2001, from 15 percent to 12 percent,
retroactive to January 1, 2001. According to estimates by the Joint Committee
on Taxation, the legislation as a whole would reduce revenue by $6 billion in
2001, $49 billion in 2002, and $958 billion in total over the 2001-11 period.

State and local governments. Available indicators for the first quarter point to
a moderate rise in real spending by state and local governments. Employment
rose 27,000 on average in January and February, similar to its pace in 2000.
Real construction spending by these governments was little changed in January.
Highway spending, which was quite weak during the final two months of last
year when the weather was unusually cold, bounced back up in January to the
third-quarter level. In contrast, spending on school construction dipped in
January after having trended up rapidly in the past year.
Although fiscal conditions for state governments have been robust in recent
years, developments this fall and winter suggest some darkening of the fiscal
picture of late. In a survey conducted in February by the National Conference
of State Legislatures, thirteen states reported that their fiscal positions had
deteriorated in recent months. Thirty-three states indicated that revenues were
on or above target in late January, down from forty-four states just two months
earlier. Most states noted that tax receipts were disappointing during the last
two months of 2000. Sales taxes were particularly weak, although some states
reported a rebound in taxes paid in January. On the spending side, more than
half of the states anticipate making supplemental payments for various
programs this fiscal year, particularly for Medicaid, and in some cases for
corrections and education programs. Nonetheless, many states are still
reporting fiscal strength, including some that have benefited from higher-than-
expected oil and/or natural gas revenues (particularly in the Rocky Mountains
and western region) and several in the northeast.
Prices and Labor Costs
The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent in January, boosted by a surge in
energy prices. Over the twelve months ending in January, the CPI was up
3.7 percent, 1 percentage point more than in the preceding year. The CPI
excluding food and energy increased 0.3 percent in January, bringing the
twelve-month change in core prices to 2.6 percent, an acceleration of
0.6 percentage point relative to the previous year (on a current-methods basis).
Energy prices jumped in January, reflecting rapid increases in natural gas and
electricity prices. Crude oil prices fluctuated over the past couple of months
but, on balance, prices of petroleum-derived products contributed little to
overall consumer price inflation in January or-according to survey data-in
February. In contrast, consumer prices for natural gas soared 17 percent in
January. However, with the passing of the coldest part of the winter heating
season, demand is retreating, and spot prices for natural gas have eased
markedly from their recent highs. Gas futures prices point to further sharp price
declines over the coming year as the increases in gas exploration over the past
year add to supply.

The CPI for electricity also rose sharply in January. Part of this increase was
due to hikes ranging from 7 to 10 percent in California, but higher natural gas
input costs drove up residential electricity prices elsewhere as well. The recent
decline in spot natural gas prices should help to reduce the cost of electricity in
most states. But residential electricity prices are likely to rise further in
California, as surcharges intended to give utilities some compensation for the
high costs of electricity generation this winter are added to consumers' electric
bills. Moreover, California faces potential capacity shortfalls that could result
in price hikes during the summer peaks in electricity demand. The state has just
begun a crash program of building mini-gas-turbine generators to help meet
summer peak demand, but when these additions will be in place is still
unclear.18 Moreover, utilities in California will lack two traditional safety
valves to meet seasonal demand this summer. First, the level of the Columbia
River is 50 percent below normal, limiting potential supplies of hydro power.
Second, the utilities' contractual ability to interrupt power supplies to some
industrial customers was exhausted in January, and thus no such cushion
remains for the summer.
Retail food prices rose 0.3 percent in January on the heels of a 0.5 percent bulge
in December. The twelve-month change in food prices was 2.9 percent in
January, up from 1.5 percent a year earlier. Prices for livestock products,
especially beef, pork, and eggs, were by far the biggest contributors to the
acceleration in the CPI for food last year, and most of these items continued to
rise in the January CPI. Spot prices of livestock remained strong in recent
weeks.
The run-up in energy prices has boosted the prices of farm production inputs
quite sharply, but thus far the pass-through of these costs to consumer prices
appears to have been small. According to USDA estimates, the prices of
energy-intensive inputs such as fertilizers, petroleum, and electricity increased
more than 25 percent, on average, over the twelve months ending in February
2001. However, farmers have a variety of possible responses to the energy
shock, including planting crops with lower energy requirements, reducing
tillage, and reducing slightly fertilizer inputs; these responses should help to
reduce costs to some extent. Moreover, even with full pass-through, the
increment to farm production costs would amount to less than 1 percent of the
$950 billion that is spent domestically on food and beverages.
18. Mini-gas-turbine generators are small plants that typically generate only 50-100
megawatts of electricity, compared with 500-1,000 megawatts for larger baseload plants. The
mini-turbines are more costly per kilowatt-hour than baseload plants, and so would be used only
during periods of peak demand, but they can be built in two to six months, rather than 1-1/2 to 2
years. In February, the California Energy Commission identified thirty-three potential sites for
mini-gas-turbines, and hopes to build enough of these turbines to add about 1,000 megawatts of
generating capacity before this summer's peak demand period.

The CPI for core commodities rose 0.1 percent in January. Over the past twelve
months, the prices of core commodities have risen 0.8 percent, an acceleration
of almost 1 percentage point relative to the small decline registered the previous
year. An acceleration in prices was especially notable for motor vehicles: The
twelve-month change in prices of used cars and trucks moved up 2 percentage
points over the year, to 4.2 percent in January, while the twelve-month change
for new vehicles was 0.3 percent in January, 1.1 percentage points higher than a
year earlier.
The CPI for non-energy services rose 0.4 percent in January, as sizable gains for
medical care and other services added to a small increase in the index for
shelter. Over the past twelve months, prices of non-energy services have risen
3.4 percent, compared with 3 percent during the previous year. Among the
major components of non-energy services, medical care has shown the most
acceleration: Over the past twelve months, prices for medical care services rose
5.0 percent, a pickup of 1-1/2 percentage points from the previous year.19
Core PCE prices were up 0.3 percent in January, bringing the twelve-month
change in this measure of inflation to 1.8 percent, an acceleration of
0.4 percentage point from the previous year.20 The pickup in core PCE price
inflation is a bit smaller than the 0.6 percentage point acceleration in the core
CPI (on a current-methods basis) over the comparable period. Nevertheless, the
acceleration shown by the two price measures has converged somewhat in
recent readings, despite the differences in scope and methodology that we have
noted in previous Greenbooks.
The surge in energy prices and its effect on the cost of producing goods and
services likely has contributed to the pickup in core consumer price inflation.
For the handful of (mainly transportation-related) industries-such as airlines,
taxis, and mass transit-with sizable energy requirements, consumer prices have
accelerated noticeably in the past year. Elsewhere, a pass-through of higher
energy costs into consumer prices is more difficult to detect explicitly.
However, we estimate that, overall, higher energy prices may account for about
one-half of the acceleration in the core price measures over the past year.
Prices for capital goods were rising early in 2001. The PPI for capital
equipment increased 0.3 percent in January, and relative to twelve months
19. In the January reading, the twelve-month changes in the CPIs for doctors' services and
for hospital services had accelerated 0.9 percentage point and 1.8 percentage points, respectively,
relative to the previous year. By contrast, in the PPI for the net output of health services, upon
which the PCE estimates of prices for medical services are based, the twelve-month change in
health services of doctors had decelerated 0.8 percentage point, while the index for hospital
services had accelerated 0.9 percentage point.
20. The acceleration in the market-based component of core PCE prices is similar.

earlier, the index was up 1.3 percent. The January rise largely reflected higher
prices for passenger cars. In contrast, computer prices fell 5.4 percent in
January, the largest monthly decline since mid-1997. The January decline,
which followed a 2 percent drop in December, brought the twelve-month
decline in computer prices to 16.2 percent, compared with a twelve-month drop
of 19 percent the previous year. Although the PPI for applications software rose
2 percent in January, this volatile index has been roughly unchanged since
August 2000, after having increased considerably earlier in 2000.21
At earlier stages of processing, most prices have fallen since the time of the last
Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials prices is
down about 5 percent, with declines registered for most commodities in the
index.
Inflation expectations have remained subdued. In the Michigan survey, the
median expectation of inflation one year ahead edged down to 2.8 percent in
February, a decrease toward the low end of the narrow range prevailing in the
past year. Over the longer term, the median expectation of inflation in the next
five to ten years crept up to 3 percent, an increase on the higher side of the
narrow range seen in the last year or two.
Recent data continue to point to a gradual acceleration in labor costs.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, as measured by the
productivity and cost data, rose at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the fourth
quarter and 5.7 percent over all of 2000, compared with an increase of
4.4 percent in 1999. For the first quarter, the only data that we have in hand are
average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers. This
measure of wages jumped 0.5 percent in February after a 0.1 percent increase
the previous month. Over the twelve months ending in February, average
hourly earnings rose 4.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3.7 percent the
previous year. A pickup in the pace of wage increases is evident in most
industries; a notable exception to this pattern is manufacturing, in which a
deceleration in wages has accompanied the weakness in activity.
21. Although the PPI for applications software is not a part of the PPI capital goods index, it
is used by the BEA as its quarterly indicator of prepackaged software prices in the NIPAs.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Changing expectations about near-term prospects for corporate profits and the
course of monetary policy were the dominant forces in financial markets over the
intermeeting period. Incoming data provided mixed signals about the direction of
the economy, but stock prices fell substantially as pessimism and uncertainty
intensified after a raft of negative earnings announcements and profit warnings,
primarily from technology firms. Amid the sell-off in equity markets, investors
marked down their expected path for the federal funds rate. Futures quotes
suggest the market expects at least a 50 basis point easing at next week's FOMC
meeting and has priced in an additional 50 basis point decline in the funds rate by
this fall.
Expectations of greater policy easing over the remainder of the year contributed
to sizable declines in most market interest rates. Lower bond rates have
encouraged corporate treasurers to issue bonds at a rapid clip, with the proceeds
used, in part, to finance paydowns of other funding, notably commercial paper.
State and local governments have also ramped up bond offerings as rates have
come down. Household borrowing has been well maintained early this year,
supported by strong growth in both mortgage debt and consumer credit. Lower
interest rates and equity price volatility have spurred expansion of the broad
monetary aggregates, with M2 and M3 growing at double-digit rates in January
and February.
Policy Expectations, Interest Rates, and Stock Prices
The FOMC's decision on January 31 to lower the target federal funds rate
50 basis points, to 5-1/2 percent, and to reiterate its view that the balance of risks
remained weighted toward economic weakness was anticipated by financial
markets and elicited little immediate response. However, weaker-than-
anticipated consumer confidence data released on February 16 renewed market
concerns about an economic slump and fueled speculation about a possible
intermeeting move. The Chairman's second round of congressional testimony on
monetary policy at the end of February effectively dispelled notions of a move
before the March FOMC meeting, but as noted above, investors anticipate policy
easings that will reduce the intended federal funds rate to 4-1/2 percent or below
by the fall.
Treasury coupon yields fell 25 to 30 basis points on balance over the intermeeting
period, to around their lowest levels in two years. Yields on Treasury inflation-
indexed securities fell about in step with comparable nominal yields, implying
little change in inflation compensation.
Yields on investment-grade private securities also declined, but by somewhat less
than those on Treasury securities, and spreads on agency debt, swaps, and
investment-grade corporate debt widened a bit. High-yield spreads changed little

over the intermeeting period, but are still quite wide by historical standards.
Commercial paper spreads narrowed somewhat, but they too remain elevated,
reflecting continued worries in that market about further downgrades or defaults.
Equity analysts continued to revise down their near-term forecasts of S&P 500
earnings in February and early March, as another wave of corporate profit
warnings surfaced. Analysts lowered their forecasts of earnings growth for the
first quarter by nearly 5 percentage points, implying a quarter-over-quarter
decline in earnings of 3 percent (seasonally adjusted) and leaving projected
earnings per share in the first quarter about 9 percent below the level four quarters
earlier. For 2001 as a whole, analysts revised S&P 500 earnings growth down
more than 3 percentage points, a sizable reduction over a six-week period.
Broad stock price indexes fell sharply, especially the tech-laden Nasdaq, which
plummeted around 30 percent. The Nasdaq is now at its lowest level since
December 1998 and is off more than 60 percent from the record high reached last
year. Broader stock indexes fell less sharply but still substantially; the
Wilshire 5000 and the S&P 500 declined nearly 15 percent over the intermeeting
period.
Business Finance
Following a record-setting pace in January, gross issuance of bonds by
nonfinancial firms remained robust in February, with substantial volumes of both
investment-grade and speculative-grade issues during the two months. However,
in recent weeks, speculative-grade issuance has tailed off, as concerns about
earnings have intensified. A large portion of the long-term bond issuance since
the start of the year represents substitution out of other debt instruments. Indeed,
nearly half of the funds raised through bond issuance in February were reported
to be targeted for retiring commercial paper, bank loans, or other fixed-income
obligations.
The commercial paper market has remained skittish as money funds and other
institutional investors continue to avoid credit risk. Commercial paper
outstanding of nonfinancial firms fell another $16 billion in February and early
March and is down $45 billion since November. Risk spreads on commercial
paper initially widened in December as year-end approached and after scares
from several issuers, and they have remained elevated in the wake of defaults by
the California utilities in January and a number of ratings downgrades on short-
term obligations.
Some commercial paper issuers have turned to commercial banks, even as banks
report that they have continued to tighten standards and terms on C&I loans and
credit lines since early this year. In addition, loan officers report that demand for
business credit has waned of late, owing to reduced investment in plant and
equipment and diminished financing for mergers and acquisitions.

III-9
With falling stock prices and elevated volatility, the pace of gross equity issuance
of nonfinancial firms remained light in February and early March. Equity
retirements have slowed as well. Announcements of new share repurchase
programs have been sparse in recent months, as firms may be guarding their cash
buffers against possible future earnings shocks. Business merger activity also has
been damped by the turbulence in equity markets, with the total deal value of
announced mergers down considerably in January and February. Cash-financed
deals have become more difficult to complete, given the dim prospects for
corporate earnings and tighter bank lending standards, while high stock-price
volatility has made it increasingly difficult for parties to agree on the terms of
stock-financed deals. Overall, net equity retirements appear to have slowed
substantially in the first quarter from the rapid pace in 2000, despite the scarcity
of new offerings.
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continues to erode. Call report
data indicate that delinquencies on business loans at banks moved up in the fourth
quarter, and the rate of business failures, on a twelve-month trailing basis, edged
up in January before returning to a more moderate level in February. Moody's
downgraded a large number of bonds of nonfinancial issuers in January and
February; Daimler-Chrysler bonds accounted for about $100 billion, or close to
two-thirds, of the total value of downgrades in February.
In addition, the junk bond default rate, on a twelve-month trailing basis, jumped
up sharply in January and again in February to the highest level since 1991. But
the increase may overstate problems in this sector, because the huge dollar
volume of defaults in the past two months results primarily from a few large
issues. A widely used, aggregated measure of firm-specific probabilities of
default on corporate debt over the coming year, the expected default frequency
(EDF) from KMV Corporation, fell a bit in January but remained quite high.
In contrast, there is little evidence of credit problems in the commercial real
estate sector, and delinquency rates on commercial mortgage debt through the
fourth quarter of last year were very low by historical standards. Interest rates on
AAA-rated commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) followed those on
comparable ten-year swaps, and CMBS-swap spreads remain in the upper part of
the narrow range in which they have fluctuated over the past two years. CMBS
issuance so far this quarter has been fairly modest, but a backlog of loans in the
pipeline is expected to provide a substantial boost to issuance in coming weeks.
The available indicators suggest that growth in commercial mortgage credit from
all sources is slowing a touch in the first quarter from the 10 percent pace in the
fourth quarter of last year.
Household Finance
The appreciable drop in stock prices has further reduced the ratio of household
assets to disposable income this quarter. This ratio now stands at its lowest level

in more than two years, having reversed about a third of its ascent during the
latter half of the 1990s.
Sinking equity markets sparked a net outflow from equity mutual funds in
February- their first monthly outflow since August 1998. Investors appear to
be seeking refuge in stable-value securities, such as bond and money funds,
which saw large inflows for the second consecutive month. The share of new
401(k) contributions allocated to equities remained steady through January, but
transfer activity within existing 401(k) assets increased appreciably, with net
outflows from equity funds.
Household debt appears to be expanding this quarter around the 8 percent pace of
recent quarters. Growth of both consumer and mortgage debt has held firm, with
the latter buoyed by the relatively low interest rates on home loans.
Measures of household credit quality have worsened somewhat of late. Personal
bankruptcy filings have popped up in recent weeks, reaching their highest level in
about two years.1 Delinquency rates on residential mortgages, credit cards, and
other consumer loans at domestic commercial banks increased as well in the
fourth quarter, moving into the higher end of the narrow bands in which they
have fluctuated over the past several years. The household debt service burden
appears to have edged up early this year, as the rise in household debt relative to
disposable income has been nearly offset by a small decline in the average
interest rate on that debt. Preliminary calculations suggest the level in the first
quarter stands just below its twenty-year high of 14-1/2 percent reached in late
1986.
Treasury and Agency Finance
Excluding cash management bills, the Treasury paid down about $38 billion of
publicly held debt in January and February. However, heavy issuance of cash
management bills in preparation for expected seasonal lows in cash balances
ahead of the March and April tax dates pushed total marketable Treasury debt
higher by $12 billion in February. Another $3 billion in buybacks were executed,
though not fully booked in February, and the Treasury announced plans to buy
back $3 billion of securities in each month of the second quarter. Also, as
previously announced, the Treasury auctioned the last fifty-two-week bill on
February 27. Beginning in August, the Treasury will estimate the one-year
constant maturity yield using a nonlinear interpolation between the yields on the
on-the-run six-month bill and two-year note as well as other issues. The constant
maturity yield is commonly referenced in adjustable-rate contracts.
1. The recent uptick may reflect, at least in part, rising odds that bankruptcy reform will be
enacted in the near future; repayment requirements are stricter in the bill before Congress,
possibly influencing some households to file before the new law is enacted.

Treasury market liquidity remained relatively low over the intermeeting period.
Bid-ask spreads for bills widened a bit, while those for coupon securities
narrowed, but the spreads on both bills and coupon securities are high compared
with recent years. As is typical, liquidity premiums for the ten-year note and the
thirty-year bond jumped after new securities were issued in the midquarter
refunding.
In February, new auction rules went into effect for noncompetitive tenders
submitted by Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA). The
changes, which are designed to make the amount of cash raised at Treasury
auctions more predictable, limit individual, noncompetitive FIMA tenders to
$200 million, with a $1 billion aggregate limit for each security auctioned. Also,
FIMA noncompetitive tenders are now filled as a portion of the announced
auction amount, not as an add-on.
Agency debt continued to expand rapidly, with net issuance of Reference and
Benchmark securities by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac totaling $68 billion for
January and February. In February, Freddie Mac inaugurated a new Dutch
auction procedure, and a $5 billion offering using the Internet was well received.
As part of an agreement reached last year with Congress, Fannie Mae inaugurated
issuance of subordinated debt on January 25. The yield on this debt has been
about 60 basis points below similarly rated corporate issues, likely reflecting the
greater liquidity of agency subordinated debt, the agencies' ties to the
government, and market expectations of a regulatory risk weighting of 20 percent
rather than 100 percent for bank holdings. As another part of the agreement with
Congress, Standard and Poor's began monitoring the "risk-to-the-government" of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in February, establishing an initial credit rating of
AA- on each agency. The rating is intended to capture the risk-status of the
agencies were they to have no special relationship with the Treasury.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross offerings of long-term debt by state and local governments picked up in
February, bringing the average for the first two months of the year to
$15.5 billion, near the average pace in 2000. February's volume consisted mostly
of new capital issues, although the sharp decline in yields since December
appears to have boosted refunding issues as well. More recently, though, yields
on long-term municipal bonds have edged up, lifting ratios of municipal bond
yields to AAA corporate bond yields, as the prospect of a cut in marginal federal
tax rates has reduced the attractiveness of holding municipal debt.
Bank Credit and Money
Bank credit growth slowed in February, owing to a runoff of securities holdings.
Loan growth, however, accelerated to an 8 percent rate, noticeably above the pace
in January and the fourth quarter of last year. Business lending, which surged in

January, moderated some in February but remained strong. Business lending has
been boosted since December by commercial paper issuers tapping backup lines
to avoid the elevated rates in that market.
Growth of consumer loans originated at banks strengthened a bit in February,
possibly reflecting brisk motor vehicle sales. A large volume of securitizations
held down real estate loan growth in January, but bookings expanded rapidly in
February, as loans for both commercial and one-to-four-family properties grew.
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remained rapid in February. The
expansion of M3 was driven by large inflows into institutional money funds, the
returns on which have become highly attractive in the wake of recent declines in
market rates. M3 growth was tempered in February by a pullback in the issuance
of bank-managed liabilities, particularly large time deposits, consistent with the
downshift in bank credit growth.
M2 continued to be lifted in February by the sharp narrowing of its opportunity
cost since November. Liquid deposits (the sum of checking and savings
accounts) and retail money funds both expanded briskly.2 Negative returns and
high volatility in equity markets likely boosted household demand for M2 assets
as well. Currency growth remained ahead of last year's lethargic pace. In
contrast, small time deposits contracted in February as their yields adjusted fairly
promptly to the decline in market rates, making them relatively less attractive
than other types of deposits.
2. Liquid deposits have been boosted at the expense of retail money market mutual funds by
large, systematic shifts between these two account types initiated by Merrill Lynch in June 2000
and by Salomon Smith Barney in January 2001.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
A special March 2001 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses since the
beginning of the year. Loan officers from fifty-four large domestic banks and twenty-
two U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey. Overall,
the responses indicated that business lending conditions at banks had tightened further
since January, while demand for business loans waned.
Lending to Businesses
The fraction of domestic banks that tightened lending standards since the beginning of
the year remained in the very elevated range of recent quarters and was comparable to
the fractions observed during the early 1990s. In March, half of the domestic bank
respondents reported applying somewhat stricter standards to applications for C&I
loans and credit lines by large and medium-sized firms, and one bank indicated that it
had tightened standards considerably. A slightly smaller percentage of domestic banks,
43 percent, reported that they had tightened standards on C&I loans to small firms. No
bank indicated that it had eased standards. For comparison, in the January survey,
60 percent of domestic banks reported stricter standards for large and medium-sized
firms, while 45 percent tightened standards to small firms.
As in the previous survey, about two-thirds of the domestic respondents said that they
had pushed up premiums on riskier loans to large and medium-sized firms at least
somewhat, including a significant fraction that had widened spreads considerably. For
small firms, 58 percent raised premiums somewhat, and 10 percent raised them
considerably. The fractions of domestic banks that toughened their policies for other
loan terms in March were also similar to the shares reported in the January survey. On
net, about 50 percent of domestic banks reported increasing the costs associated with
credit lines, charging higher spreads over their cost of funds, tightening loan covenants,
and raising collateral requirements for C&I loans to large and medium-sized firms.
Between a quarter and a third of domestic banks, on net, toughened terms on C&I loans
to small firms.
The percentage of branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported stricter
standards on C&I loans fell to 46 percent in March from almost 80 percent in January.
Substantial numbers of foreign banks also reported further tightening of loan terms
during the first two months of the year. On net, 57 percent of foreign banks reported
charging somewhat higher premiums on riskier loans, down a fair bit from more than
80 percent in January, and one respondent indicated that it had somewhat reduced these
premiums. About 40 percent of foreign banks, on net, also reported a general increase
in spreads over their cost of funds, down from 75 percent in January. On net,
57 percent of foreign banks tightened loan covenants, and 52 percent raised collateral
requirements, compared with 60 percent and 46 percent, respectively, in January.

III-A-2
More than half of the domestic respondents indicated that a less favorable economic
outlook was a very important factor in their decision to tighten standards or terms, and
almost all domestic banks claimed that the economic outlook was at least a somewhat
important factor. About a third of the domestic banks also reported that a worsening of
industry-specific problems and a reduced tolerance for risk were very important reasons
for tightening. In addition, many domestic banks mentioned continued defaults by
below-investment-grade borrowers in public debt markets as a somewhat important
reason for tightening. Interestingly, some respondents also commented on the rapid
deterioration in certain investment-grade credits. At branches and agencies of foreign
banks, a worsening of industry-specific problems and a less favorable or more uncertain
economic outlook were, on average, the most important reasons for tightening.
Respondents indicated that demand for C&I loans weakened further since the beginning
of the year. On net, more than 40 percent of domestic banks and 23 percent of foreign
banks reported moderately or substantially weaker demand for C&I loans, compared
with 50 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in January. Both domestic and foreign
respondents cited their customers' reduced investment in plant and equipment as the
most important reason for diminished demand, followed by a decrease in the need for
merger and acquisition financing. Among the few banks that reported higher demand
for C&I loans, a decrease in internally generated funds was most often cited as an
important or very important reason.

In December, the value of exports of goods and services declined for the fourth
consecutive month, with decreases primarily in capital goods and industrial
supplies. For the fourth quarter, the value of exports fell 5-1/4 percent at an
annual rate from the prior quarter. Notable declines were recorded in exported
computers, semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, aircraft, automotive
products, consumer goods, and agricultural products. Exports of other
machinery grew only slightly following strong increases in the first three
quarters of the year. By area, much of the decline in the fourth quarter was in
exports to developing economies in Asia (particularly Taiwan and Korea),
Mexico, and Canada (especially automotive parts). Exports to Western Europe
rose for the fifth consecutive quarter.
The value of imports in December dropped for the third consecutive month, as
sharp declines in automotive vehicles, consumer goods, and computers were
only partly offset by a strong increase in the value (mostly price) of imported
natural gas. The rise in the value of imported oil in December was entirely from
higher quantity as the average price dropped. For the fourth quarter, the value of
imports leveled off at the high level recorded in the third quarter. Declines in
imported automotive products, computers, semiconductors, steel, and chemicals
were offset by increased imports of telecommunications equipment, consumer
goods, and smaller increases in other categories of trade.

Note: Quarterly data on the U.S. current account, and other U.S. international
transactions, for 2000:Q4 and the year will be released by the Commerce
Department on Thursday, March 15. These data will be reported in the
Greenbook supplement.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The price of imported oil (BLS) declined 5 percent in January following a
drop of nearly 11 percent in December, largely on news of weakening U.S.
economic growth. However, spot oil prices moved higher in January with
OPEC's decision to cut oil production targets 1.5 million barrels per day. Since
the beginning of February, spot WTI has fluctuated between $27 and $32 per
barrel, recently trading near the low end of this range.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods rose 0.3 percent in January
following a 0.9 percent increase in December. The index for industrial supplies
again led the advance for prices of non-oil imports, rising 1.4 percent in January
after gaining 3.6 percent in December. The increase in January reflected the
ongoing rise in prices of natural gas as well as an upturn in prices of unfinished
metals, whereas the increase in December was primarily from a surge in the
price of natural gas alone. Prices of most other imported core goods (which
exclude oil, computers, and semiconductors) were little changed in January.
Prices of imported computers and semiconductors both declined slightly in
January.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports rose slightly in January following a small
decline in December. All of the major categories of exported core goods (which
exclude agricultural products, computers, and semiconductors) either posted
small increases or were unchanged in January. Core goods prices had posted
three months of small declines prior to January. An important part of this
turnaround was in industrial supplies, led by rising prices for chemicals and
metals. Prices of agricultural exports rose for the fifth consecutive month,
reflecting continued increase in prices for grains. As they have in most months,
prices of exported computers and semiconductors declined in January
Note: Price data for February will be released by BLS on Thursday, March 15,
and will be reported in the Greenbook supplement.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserves held in the United States (line 1 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions table) decreased modestly in December but
increased $39 billion for the year, marginally less than in 1999. However,
reserves held in the United States increased a substantial $18 billion in January,
with the largest increases recorded by China ($6 billion), Taiwan ($4 billion) and

IV-6
Hong Kong ($3 billion). Turkish reserves in the United States mirrored their
total reserves: they increased $4 billion during the December-January period as
Turkey received disbursements from IMF emergency loans, but were depleted by
a like amount during February as financial difficulties re-emerged. Also during
February, China's reserves held at FRBNY increased by $15 billion. This could
reflect a transfer of reserves from another U.S. custodian to FRBNY, a transfer
of reserves from abroad to FRBNY, or an increase in China's total reserves. If
indeed this reflects an increase in total reserves, it would represent a significant
break in the pattern of steady, modest increases. However, China's recent
privatization of several large state-owned enterprises might account for such a
significant increase in its reserves.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) continued at a strong
pace in December and January. Total net purchases in 2000 were $414 billion,
up from $319 billion in 1999 and well in excess of the record $348 billion set in
1997. Record net purchases of equities, corporate bonds, and agency bonds
contrasted with record net sales of Treasury securities.
Treasuries (line 4a) were sold on net in both months, with unusually large net
sales in January. Treasury securities have now recorded net sales in each of the
past five quarters. Net purchases of U.S. equities (line 4d) were at a near record
level in January, while net purchases of agency and corporate bonds (lines 4b
and 4c) continued to be strong.
There were modest net U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) in both
December and January. For the year, U.S. net purchases were slightly below,
but similar to, the levels recorded in the previous two years. As in prior years,
most U.S. net acquisitions in 2000 resulted from stock swaps (line 5c).
The U.S. banking sector (line 3) experienced large net outflows in January, due
primarily to a significant increase in claims. The increase in claims may be
attributable in part to a potential break in series in the TIC banking forms, which
now separately report repurchase agreement activity. The new reporting formats
may also subsequently result in larger-than-normal revisions to the January
banking data as reporters adapt to the new form.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The major currencies index of the exchange value of the dollar has risen
2-3/4 percent on balance since the January FOMC meeting. The dollar's gains
were due primarily to appreciations of 3-1/4 percent against the Canadian dollar
and 4-1/2 percent versus the yen.
Exchange Value of the Dollar
The Canadian dollar appeared to be pressured by signs of a slowing economy.
Fourth quarter GDP fell short of market expectations, as domestic demand
stagnated. On March 6, the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate 50 basis
points, citing weakening domestic demand as well as concerns that the
slowdown in the U.S. economy could be more pronounced than had been
expected earlier in the year. Following the Bank of Canada's policy action,
Canadian short-term interest rates fell below rates in the United States,
contributing to further pressure on the Canadian currency.
Data showing that Japan may be slipping back into recession seemed to weigh
on the yen and counterbalanced the effects of fiscal year-end repatriation flows
from Japanese exporters and financial institutions. Comments by Bank of Japan
Governor Hayami, in which he discussed "a policy to induce a massive
depreciation of the yen's exchange value" as one of the "drastic,
unconventional" options facing the Bank of Japan, no doubt contributed to the
softness of the yen, as did concerns over the future direction of Japan's political
leadership.

IV-9
The dollar has appreciated 1 percent on balance versus the euro, as many market
participants have reportedly lowered their intermediate-term growth expectations
for Germany. Also contributing to market participants negative outlook for the
euro-area economy and the euro's exchange value were concerns that with
inflation continuing to hover above the European Central Bank's 2 percent limit,
the ECB's short-run flexibility to adjust policy to changing economic conditions
may be hindered.
The U.S. dollar appreciated 9-3/4 percent against the Australian dollar, as the
Australian currency fell to a new low against the dollar. Markets were quite
surprised by data showing that Australian GDP had contracted in the fourth
quarter. The dollar appreciated 1/2 percent against the pound.
The index of the exchange value of the dollar versus the currencies of our other
important trading partners rose 1/2 percent over the intermeeting period, owing
primarily to appreciations of 7-1/2 percent against the Indonesian rupiah and
5-1/2 percent against the Brazilian real. In early February, the real weakened, in
part, on concerns over spillovers from the worsening financial problems in
Turkey. However, the real continued to weaken even after Turkey's financial
markets appeared to stabilize, on concerns over a domestic political dispute in
Brazil. Political concerns were also a major cause of weakness for the
Indonesian currency.

Over the intermeeting period, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee lowered its key interest rate 25 basis points and the Reserve Bank of
Australia reduced its main policy rate a total of 75 basis points. Three-month
rates moved in line with the official target rates. Long-term rates in the
industrial countries, as measured by the yield on ten-year government bonds,
also moved lower, as market expectations for economic growth in the near term
were revised downward.
On February 9, the Bank of Japan announced that it would soon change the
operation of its discount window to a Lombard facility. In addition, the BOJ
reduced the rate on this instrument by 15 basis points. On February 28, the BOJ
cut the target of its key overnight rate by 10 basis points to 15 basis points and
further lowered the discount/Lombard rate by 10 basis points, to 25 basis points.
Three-month yen rates have fallen 27 basis points over the intermeeting period,
mainly in reaction to the BOJ's two policy actions. Weakness in equity prices
and renewed pessimism over near-term prospects for economic growth in Japan
contributed to the 35 basis point tumble of the yield on the benchmark ten-year
Japanese government bond. The last time ten-year yields were this low, in the
second quarter of 1999, the Bank of Japan had recently pushed overnight rates
almost to zero. There has been considerable market speculation that the Bank of
Japan may reinstate the zero interest rate policy or take other measures such as
increasing its outright purchases on ten-year government bonds in a effort to
reverse the reemerging deflationary trend.
Over the intermeeting period, share prices dropped sharply in all of the major
industrial countries. Canadian equity prices had the sharpest downturn, in part
due to earnings warnings from several optical networking companies that
comprise a large share of the Toronto index. In Japan, the Nikkei index fell to a
level last seen in early 1985; the broader Topix index still remains 20 percent
above its recent low reached in October 1998. Share prices in most emerging
market economies have also declined since the January FOMC meeting, in line
with movements in the industrial country indexes.
The price of gold rose 1 percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with
one-month lease rates spiking to nearly 7 percent. Market participants have
speculated that less central bank gold is being made available to the lease
market, pushing up lease rates and leading short sellers to cover their positions.
.The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of
the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Data released since the January Greenbook indicate that economic activity in the
foreign industrial countries grew at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter of
2000, but recent indicators point to a slowing in the current quarter.
Performance across countries remains uneven. Although Japanese real GDP
posted a sizable increase in the fourth quarter, fueled largely by an increase in
corporate investment, indicators for January were weak, suggesting that the first
quarter will see a reversal of much of this growth. In the euro area, real GDP
recorded a solid gain in the fourth quarter, about matching the growth pace of
the prior two quarters. Overall, the euro area appears to have cooled slightly in
the first quarter of this year, with activity in Germany notably weak. Both the
United Kingdom and Canada have experienced more significant slowing in
activity since the middle of last year.
Declining prices for petroleum-based energy caused broad measures of inflation
to recede in January from recent peaks. However, energy prices remained above
their levels of a year ago, keeping twelve-month headline inflation above core
rates. Core inflation remains comfortably within target ranges for most of the
major industrial countries. Japanese consumer price deflation continued in the
early part of this year, with a 1.1 percent decline in core consumer prices posted
over the twelve months ended in February.
Recent indicators for Japan suggest a sharp slowing in the early part of this
year. Real GDP rose 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, more than reversing the
third-quarter decline. However, growth in business investment more than
accounted for the increase, while both private consumption and net exports fell.
The rapid growth in investment largely reflects the rising corporate profits and
business confidence of earlier last year, both of which have since cooled.
Activity indicators for January have so far been weak: Industrial production was
about 3 percent below the fourth quarter's average level, and both housing and
nonresidential construction starts were down about 2 percent over the same
period. Equipment investment, which had been the leading sector last year,
showed a sharp reversal in January, with both orders and shipments of
machinery down sharply. Indicators of household spending have been mixed,
with real expenditures for all households falling in January to a level slightly
below the fourth-quarter average, and new car registrations rebounding after two
quarters of decline.
Employment fell in both December and January (reversing about half of the
roughly 1 percent increase in employment recorded between July and
November), and the unemployment rate reached a postwar high. The job-offers-

IV-13
to-applicants ratio edged down in January after more than a year of small but
steady increases.

Prices continue to decline. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 1.1 percent in
February relative to a year ago. Twelve-month changes in wholesale prices for
domestic goods have been negative in the past five months after having been
boosted for several months by the runup in energy prices. Land prices have also
continued to fall; the national urban land price index in the third quarter of 2000
was 6-1/4 percent below its year-earlier level. The GDP deflator in the fourth
quarter was down 1.8 percent from a year earlier.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) totaled $100 billion in
2000, down from $108 billion in 1999, with most of the decline occurring in the
fourth quarter. The trade surplus narrowed further in January on a seasonally
adjusted basis to $37 billion at an annual rate, the lowest level in nearly five
years. The declining surplus reflects the impact of higher oil prices as well as a
softening of exports to developing Asian countries.

Japanese officials have become increasingly worried about the gloomy
economic news. The ruling coalition has announced an emergency economic
package which includes several "stock market revitalization" measures to
provide tax and other economic incentives to encourage more people to invest in
the stock market. It also proposes the establishment of a private body to buy
cross shareholdings from banks; these shareholdings must be marked to market
in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Other measures are aimed at increasing the
liquidity of the real estate market, including reforming regulations on land use in
urban areas. The proposals also include a call for quantitative easing of
monetary policy and the setting of an inflation target by the Bank of Japan. The
BOJ lowered its target for the overnight call rate 10 basis points to 15 basis
point on February 28; the latest proposals suggest that the government would
like the BOJ to go further in easing monetary policy.

IV-15
At the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's convention on March 12, Prime
Minister Mori announced that a new election for party president will be held
before his term expires in September. Because the party president becomes
Prime Minister, this effectively amounts to a resignation. Negotiations over the
timing of the new election are still underway, but it is widely expected to be
held as early as April.
Euro-area GDP was up 2.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, rising
somewhat faster than the previous quarter's pace. Domestic demand growth
picked up in the fourth quarter due in part to stronger government spending and
a large contribution from inventory investment. Consumer spending also picked
up following its weak third quarter performance, but still grew only a modest
1.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Investment spending increased only
1.7 percent, slowing considerably from its rate of growth in the previous quarter.
Both exports and imports continued to expand at double-digit rates in the fourth
quarter, with export growth outpacing import growth. Consequently, net
exports made another positive contribution to growth, adding roughly 0.5
percentage points in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter growth in the euro area was uneven. For example, in Germany,
GDP rose only 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.), as final domestic demand remained weak.
However, GDP in Italy rose over 3 percent in the fourth quarter, and nearly
4 percent in France.
Indicators for the current quarter are mixed, but on balance suggest the
continuation of moderate growth. The euro-area purchasing managers surveys
moved down for the tenth consecutive month in February, but to a level that
indicates that manufacturing activity continues to expand. Euro-area industrial
confidence declined somewhat further in February. Consumer confidence
moved back down in January and February, but remained slightly above the
fourth-quarter average. In Germany, manufacturing orders for January fell
sharply after increasing substantially in the fourth quarter. However, the
German Ifo index ticked up in January, partly reversing seven consecutive
monthly declines, while German industrial production increased a larger-than-
expected 0.9 percent. The French survey of consumer climate improved in
January to a record high, and subsided only slightly below that level in
February. French consumption of manufactured products also registered a large
increase in January.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged up to 8.8 percent in
January, in part reflecting the addition of unemployment data for Greece. Still,
on a comparable basis the unemployment rate is down nearly a full percentage
point from a year ago. Based on national statistics, the French unemployment

IV-16
rate moved down in January to 9 percent. In Germany, recent sluggish rates of
economic growth appear to have slowed employment gains. As a result, the
German unemployment rate (based on national statistics) edged up to 9.3
percent in January and remained at that rate in February.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation in the euro area declined to
2.4 percent in January from 2.6 percent in December due to lower energy prices,
but remained above the European Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling for the
eighth consecutive month. The twelve-month rate of core inflation (which
excludes energy and food prices) rose to 1.6 percent in January. In addition,
February consumer prices in Germany and Italy rose 0.5 percent (s.a.) and
0.3 percent, respectively. These increases reflect a rebound in energy prices as
well as higher meat prices associated with Europe's evolving livestock disease
crisis. France, which remains as one of the low-inflation nations of the euro
area, recorded a modest increase of 0.1 percent in consumer prices for February;
this came after two consecutive monthly declines in consumer prices, owing in
part to falling energy and clothing prices.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 1.3 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth
quarter, down sharply from growth in the prior two quarters. Total domestic
demand rose a modest 0.5 percent; moderate consumption growth and a strong
expansion of fixed investment were offset by a negative contribution from
inventory accumulation. Robust growth in exports together with a moderate rise
in imports saw net exports make a positive contribution to fourth quarter GDP
growth.

Data for the current quarter point to somewhat firmer growth in economic
activity. Both consumer and business confidence indices were up in January and
remain high relative to historical levels. Industrial production, which fell in the
fourth quarter, was flat in January. The volume of retail sales increased
0.7 percent in January to a level 2.8 percent above its fourth-quarter average.
Notwithstanding some recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions
remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate edged down to 3.4
percent in February, the lowest rate in 25 years, while the labor force survey
measure of the unemployment rate declined to a record low of 5.2 percent for
the three months centered in December. Average annual earnings growth for
December breached the 412 percent rate that the Bank of England believes to be
compatible with its inflation target, but fell back to a 4 percent rate for the
twelve months ended in January. Producer input prices have moderated in
recent months, reflecting a fall in fuel prices, and the twelve-month rate of retail
price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) continues to run below
the 212 percent target.
At its February 8, 2001 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the
Bank of England voted to lower the official repo rate to 5.75 percent. This is the
first move since February 2000 and the first cut since June 1999.

On March 7, 2001, Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced the government's
budget for the fiscal year 2001-2002. The budget is slightly expansionary and is
seen by some as reflecting the current government's desire to boost its
popularity in advance of the coming general election (which is expected to take
place in May of this year). On the taxation side, the budget will raise the upper
end of the lowest tax bracket and will broaden the coverage of last year's cut in
the capital gains tax. Duties on most fuels will also be cut, although the tax
relief on unleaded petrol expires in June. The budget provides for an additional
£2.3 billion in public spending to be spread over the next three years, mainly on
education and health. A budget surplus of about 21/2 percent of GDP is forecast
for fiscal year 2001-2002.
Real GDP in Canada rose a weaker-than-expected 2.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
fourth quarter, down from a growth rate of 4.5 percent in the third quarter.
Growth of consumer spending slowed in the fourth quarter, led by sharply lower
automobile purchases. Following very high growth in the first three quarters of
2000, fixed investment fell in the final quarter, reflecting a broad-based decline
in machinery and equipment investment. After surging in the third quarter,
inventory investment slowed, subtracting 2.6 percentage points from growth.

IV-20
Export growth edged further down, with rising exports of energy products and
machinery and equipment nearly offset by declining motor vehicle exports.
Mainly as a result of a substantial decline in imports, net exports added 4.7
percentage points to fourth-quarter growth.

Limited available data suggest that while the Canadian economy retains many
areas of strength, intensifying weakness in the manufacturing sector is
continuing to slow growth in the current quarter. Various surveys of business
conditions in the manufacturing industry plummeted in January and
manufacturing employment fell sharply in both January and February.
However, housing starts and employment data through February suggest the
construction sector remains healthy, led by a rebound in residential investment
following a sluggish fourth quarter. Non-trade-related service sector
employment also continues to expand, consistent with continued strength in this
sector.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 3 percent in January, at
the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target range. Higher
energy prices continue to account for much of the increase in consumer prices,
as the twelve-month core rate of inflation (which excludes food and energy

IV-21
prices) was only 2 percent in January. Wage increases have moderated, with
average hourly earnings rising 3 percent in the twelve months ending in January,
down from a rate close to 4 percent in previous months.

The Bank of Canada lowered its policy rate, the Bank Rate, 25 basis points on
January 23 and an additional 50 basis points on March 6, to 5.25 percent. In its
March 6 statement, the Bank cited "indications that the slowdown in the U.S.
economy in the first half of 2001 could be more pronounced than expected" as a
reason for its decision. The Bank cited weaker domestic demand as further
justification, noting that "in Canada, recent information suggests that the
positive underlying momentum in the economy at the end of 2000 was
somewhat less strong than had been previously estimated." The Bank's next
policy announcement date is April 17.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Data received since the last Greenbook have confirmed that growth in major
developing countries has slowed markedly. In most countries, the slowdown
largely appeared to reflect weaker external demand. In Latin America, output
actually declined in Mexico in the fourth quarter of last year, while economic
activity was about flat in Argentina. Growth appears to have turned negative in
most of emerging Asia in the first quarter of this year, after having slowed
sharply in the fourth quarter, and showed signs of moderating in China.
Inflation rates have edged down across the developing countries, consistent with
the slowdown in growth; deflation has intensified in Argentina.
Turkey abandoned its crawling-peg exchange-rate regime on February 22,
allowing the lira to float. Since then, the lira has depreciated about 30 percent
against the dollar and inflation has begun to rise. In an effort to instill
confidence, Prime Minister Ecevit put a new economic team in place, including
Kemal Dervis, former senior World Bank official, and Surreya Serdengecti, who
was appointed the new governor of the central bank; Serdengecti was formerly
the bank's deputy governor. Turkish authorities and the IMF are working on a
new economic program that is expected to be announced soon.
In Mexico, recent data provide clear evidence that economic activity has
weakened. Real GDP fell 3 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth quarter of last year, a
sharp deterioration from the over 6.5 percent growth recorded in the prior
quarter. In large part, the drop in output was due to weak external demand
resulting from the slowdown in the United States. Mexican exports declined in
January for the third consecutive month, while imports have been roughly flat
since last October; as a result, the trade deficit increased to over $11 billion
(s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 2000 and to $18 billion in January. The current
account deficit also widened in the fourth quarter to over $22.5 billion (n.s.a.) at
an annual rate. Consistent with weaker economic activity and tight domestic
policies, the twelve-month inflation rate moved down in January and February.
Mexico posted a public sector deficit equal to 1.1 percent of GDP for 2000, a bit
larger than the government's target. This year's target for the deficit is
0.7 percent of GDP. However, earlier this month, Mexico's finance minister
warned that, without fiscal reform, the augmented deficit--including the
financing costs of the liabilities arising from bank restructuring and other
expenditures--could be in the neighborhood of 4 percent of GDP. A fiscal
reform package aimed at overhauling government finances on both the revenue
and expenditure sides is expected to be presented to the legislature later this
month.

In Argentina, data since the last Greenbook indicate continued stagnation.
Industrial production, which had increased sharply in December, declined in
January, leaving the level well below the most recent peak at the end of 1999.
Construction and sales indicators for January also point to weakness and
consumer prices in February fell 1.7 percent compared with the same month a
year earlier. The federal government's fiscal deficit for the January-February
period reached $1.4 billion; as a result, the government is widely expected to
miss its deficit target with the IMF for the first quarter.
On the heels of the FOMC rate cuts and the final approval by the IMF executive
board of the assistance package in January, financial market confidence in
Argentina greatly improved in January. During the late January-early February
period, the Argentine government was able to execute several successful
rollovers of short-term debt and a $4.2 billion bond exchange to lengthen the
maturity profile of its debt. Financial conditions deteriorated in February,
however, as a result of the negative domestic data releases, spillover effects
from the crisis in Turkey, and calls for the resignation of the president of the
central bank. In early March, Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea resigned
and was replaced by Ricardo Lopez Murphy, reportedly a staunch advocate of
fiscal austerity. Lopez Murphy is expected to unveil a package of fiscal reform
and economic stimulus measures soon.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have painted a mixed picture
on economic activity. Real GDP growth slowed to 0.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in fourth
quarter from a revised 8.9 percent in third quarter, but industrial production
surged in December. Although industrial production gave back some of
December's surge in January, other data releases have pointed to continued
strength. The unemployment rate fell considerably in recent months, although
the drop largely reflected declines in the labor force. Over the mid-December to
mid-January period, the central bank cut (in two steps) its benchmark overnight
interest rate, the Selic, from 16.5 percent to 15.25 percent. Loan rates charged
by domestic banks have fallen more steeply over this period. Meanwhile, the
inflation rate continued to decline.
The government recorded a sizeable primary fiscal surplus in January. In early
February, the federal government also announced spending cuts equivalent to
about 0.5 percent of GDP to offset additional expenditures that had not been
programmed into the 2001 fiscal budget. In early March, President Cardoso
unveiled reform initiatives for the remainder of his term in office, which ends in
December 2002, including a proposal to grant central bank officials political
independence.

Data on the Venezuelan economy have been sparse since the last Greenbook.
What little information has been released points to continued recovery with
inflation remaining on a downward trend. Auto sales have continued to rise
while consumer prices over the twelve months ended February were up about
13 percent. With the price of oil falling somewhat, there is growing concern that
Venezuela's fast pace of government spending will lead to a large fiscal deficit
and a greater need for the government to tap domestic and international
financing sources, intensifying financial vulnerabilities and possibly crowding
out domestic private investment.
In Korea, the latest indicators of economic activity have been somewhat less
negative than was the case late last year. Industrial production increased in
January. However, this followed four consecutive months of decline, and
inventories continued to increase. Measures of consumer confidence also
moved up in January, breaking, at least temporarily, their downward trend over
the second half of last year. Inflation, which had been pushed up in recent
months by higher oil prices and a depreciating won, was unchanged in February,
remaining slightly above the upper end of the Bank of Korea's target range.
On February 8, the Bank of Korea announced a 25 basis point reduction in its
overnight interest rate target. The last change in the rate had been a 25 basis
point increase last October. In explaining its easing move, Bank officials cited a

IV-29
greater-than-expected slowing in the pace of economic activity, and expressed
confidence that this slowing would lead to a reduction in inflation later in the
year.

In the ASEAN region, recent data point to declining economic activity. Real
GDP fell in Indonesia and was roughly flat in the Philippines in the fourth
quarter. For the first quarter of this year, monthly data show declines in
industrial production throughout the region, even in Singapore and Malaysia,
which had registered strong GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Exports fell in
most ASEAN countries in the fourth quarter, and monthly trade surpluses shrank
in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. With the exception of Indonesia and the
Philippines, inflation remained very low in the region.
Much of the political uncertainty that has plagued several ASEAN countries in
recent months has been resolved. In the Philippines and Thailand, the
transitions to new governments have been smooth, although there are issues that
continue to provide some concern. On the other hand, in Indonesia, the pressure
on President Wahid to resign is growing, and impeachment proceedings have
begun. In addition, regional violence in several parts of the Indonesian
archipelago poses a threat to domestic security and international confidence.

In China, the latest economic indicators suggest a moderation in the pace of
growth, led by a weakening in exports. Industrial production rose 10.2 percent
in the January-February period from the same period a year earlier, a little
slower than its pace of growth in previous months. Exports in January and
February recovered somewhat from their steep decline late last year, but
remained relatively weak. Inflation remained very low; consumer prices were
unchanged in February compared with the same month a year ago, partly
reflecting a decline in food prices in February following January's Lunar New
Year holiday.
In a speech to the National People's Congress in early March, Premier Zhu
Rongji announced an annual growth target for real GDP of 7 percent for the
2001-2005 period. To meet the target, Premier Zhu said that the government
will "continue to implement a pro-active fiscal policy to increase investment."

China's efforts to reform its domestic stock markets continued in February,
when the government relaxed restrictions on the purchase of B shares by local

In Hong Kong, real GDP declined 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.
Output was dragged down by a sharp fall in exports, in part reflecting weaker
U.S. and Japanese growth and a related slowdown in global electronics demand.
More recent trade data suggest that the weakness in exports continued into 2001.
Nonetheless, the trade deficit shrank in January, as imports declined sharply. In
addition, private consumption remained sluggish in the fourth quarter, as high
real interest rates and uncertainties in the stock and property markets continued
to weigh on consumer confidence. The unemployment rate, however, edged
down to 4.3 percent (s.a.) in the November-January period, and the
twelve-month rate of decline in consumer prices eased in January. In its fiscal
budget for 2001, announced in early March, the government projected a small
deficit for this year.
In Taiwan, real GDP ticked up 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth quarter of last
year. Private consumption showed only a modest increase, restrained by higher
unemployment and sharply lower local stock prices. Exports and investment
spending declined sharply. More recent data point to continued sluggishness,
with industrial production plunging 12.1 percent (s.a.) in January, although
much of this decline reflected fewer working days that month due to the
unusually early Lunar New Year holidays. In addition, exports in the
January-February period were down about 4 percent compared with the same
period a year earlier. Consumer prices were highly volatile around the holidays,
but on average inflation remained low. In early March, Taiwan's central bank

trimmed interest rates an additional 12-1/2 basis points, following a cut of 25 basis
points in February.
