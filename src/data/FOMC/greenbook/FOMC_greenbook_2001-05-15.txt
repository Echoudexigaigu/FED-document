Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity is now estimated to have posted a modest increase in the first
quarter, but the second quarter is off to a shaky start. In the labor market,
payroll employment fell appreciably in April, and unemployment rose.
Moreover, the recent information on new orders points to continued softness in
business investment, and inventories in a number of sectors remain excessive
despite the sharp production cuts of the past several months. And although
household spending, especially on motor vehicles and housing, has held up
remarkably well to date, it, too, appears to be tilting toward slower growth.
Core inflation seems to have continued the gentle upward drift that has been
apparent since early 2000.
Employment
Labor market conditions have deteriorated considerably of late. Private
nonfarm payroll employment dropped 261,000 in April, and the unemployment
rate rose another 0.2 percentage point, to 4.5 percent. Whereas the downturn in
labor demand previously had been concentrated in the manufacturing sector and
the related help-supply and wholesale trade industries, the April employment
report suggests that the rest of the labor market has softened.
Employment in the manufacturing sector fell 104,000 last month, bringing the
cumulative decline since the start of the year to 373,000. In April, employment
in the electrical machinery industry declined 31,000, with two-thirds of the
decline occurring in the electronic components sector, which includes producers
of computer chips. Since February, payrolls in electrical machinery have fallen
an average of 17,000 a month, compared with average gains of 3,000 a month
over the previous four months. Elsewhere, producers of metals and industrial
machinery also suffered large job losses in April.
Sectors outside of manufacturing also experienced significant payroll declines in
April. The help-supply industry shed more than 100,000 workers; since
employment in this sector started to turn down last fall, job losses have totaled
370,000. Through March, the decline in help-supply jobs appeared attributable
predominantly to the slowdown in manufacturing; however, the weakness in
other sectors in April suggests that the help-supply job cuts may now be
reflecting more widespread weakness in the labor market.1 In particular,
employment in the services industry excluding help-supply, which rose 100,000
per month, on average, in the first quarter, fell 13,000 in April, the first decline
since February 1992. And although retail trade added 22,000 workers in April,
1. The help-supply industry is classified as a services industry but provides workers to
sectors outside the services industry, such as manufacturing.

the sector had cut 46,000 jobs in March. Employment in the construction
industry fell 64,000 in April, retracing some of the unseasonably strong hiring
during the winter months. Smoothing through these swings, construction
employment has increased by an average of 17,000 per month since last
September, about half of the average monthly increase during the same period a
year earlier.
Reflecting the large decline in employment, aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers fell 0.3 percent in April; the workweek held steady at
34.3 hours. As the economy slowed in the second half of last year, employers
initially cut workweeks by a quarter of an hour and reduced hiring. Since
January, however, the workweek has stabilized, and the level of employment
has declined.
The April rise in the unemployment rate left it 0.5 percentage point above where
it stood in December. Underscoring the job cuts evident in the payroll survey,
employment also fell in the household survey in April, and the number of job
losers unemployed less than five weeks jumped to 1.1 percent of household
employment, the highest level since June 1995. The recent increases in short-
term job losers have contributed 0.3 percentage point to the rise in the overall
unemployment rate since December. Meanwhile, the labor force participation
rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in April to 67.1 percent, which was the
fourth-quarter average.
Other indicators point to a further weakening in labor demand through the end
of April. Initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ended April
28 rose to 405,000 (on a four-week moving-average basis), the highest level
since 1993. In addition, respondents to the Conference Board's consumer
sentiment survey have increasingly reported jobs to be both less plentiful and
harder to get, and expectations about future labor market conditions, as
measured by both the Conference Board and Michigan surveys, worsened a bit
in April; the Michigan unemployment expectations index is now registering its
weakest reading since January 1992. Meanwhile, according to the National
Federation of Independent Business, the percentage of businesses with hard-to-
fill positions was flat in April after having fallen sharply in March to the lowest
level since 1997.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector was about unchanged in the first quarter of 2001, after having
risen at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the fourth quarter. However, this
pattern reflects swings in hours of self-employed workers, which are a volatile
component of total hours. Because of this volatility, output per hour of
employees, whose hours account for more than 90 percent of total hours,
provides a clearer picture of movements in productivity in recent quarters. In

the fourth quarter and 1.2 percent in the first quarter.
BLS recently released data on multifactor productivity (MFP), capital
deepening, and labor composition in 1999 and revisions to earlier years.2 The
MFP release had no implications for labor productivity growth through 1999,
only for the contributions of the various components. Relative to our previous
estimates, these data showed more capital deepening, a larger contribution from

changes in labor composition, and less of an increase in multifactor
productivity. In particular, the BLS reported that MFP rose just 0.6 percent on a
year-over-year basis in 1999, well below the 1.4 percent increase posted in
1998. In light of the new data, we reduced slightly our estimate of the annual
growth rate of structural multifactor productivity between 1996 and 1999, and
raised slightly the average annual contribution of capital deepening to structural
productivity growth. (The implications of these data for our projection of
structural productivity are discussed in Part 1.)
Industrial Production
The hours worked and weekly physical product data suggest that industrial
production edged down in April. Although the output of motor vehicles and
parts posted a gain, the remainder of manufacturing continued to be restrained
by excess inventories and soft demand. Utilities production declined last month
because of warm weather, while mining output increased for a fourth
consecutive month, reflecting above-average gains in coal and oil and natural
gas extraction.
Output in high-tech industries slowed noticeably in the first four months of the
year. In the semiconductor industry, bloated inventories coupled with softening
demand from downstream industries resulted in a drop in output in the first
quarter, and incoming data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)
suggest that the decline was even more severe than we had initially estimated.
The latest Dataquest survey of large semiconductor buyers suggests that
purchasers' inventories of semiconductors were still very high in March. More
recently, some trade analysts have reported that chip inventories at PC
manufacturers returned to comfortable levels in April, but some
communications equipment firms, particularly Cisco, have indicated that their
inventories of chips are excessive.
Although output in the computer industry has continued to slow, the steepest
retrenchment in demand may be behind us. According to information from
Dataquest, unit sales of PCs declined 3 percent (not at an annual rate) in the first
quarter, considerably less than the 8-3/4 percent drop in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, conditions in the communications industry continue to deteriorate.
In particular, new orders for communications equipment fell considerably in

February and March, and several firms have announced layoffs; indeed,
employment in the telecom industry has fallen sharply from its December peak.
Some of the indicators of manufacturing activity outside the transportation and
high-tech industries have taken a mild turn for the better. Although the overall
purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained below 50 in April, the diffusion
index of new orders moved up noticeably, suggesting that the rate of decline
has slowed. Additionally, responses regarding inventories improved: The
NAPM index measuring the change in manufacturers' own inventory holdings
dropped to its lowest level in more than four years, and the percentage of
respondents who perceived their customers' inventories as too high declined
for a third consecutive month. These movements are largely consistent with
the aggressive liquidation of factory stocks reported by the Census Bureau in
February and March. In spite of these improvements, however, many
industries-including machinery, chemicals, primary and fabricated metals,
rubber and plastics, and construction materials, supplies and intermediate
products-continue to exhibit sizable inventory overhangs.

This month the NAPM also released the results of the latest survey on
manufacturers' expected capital expenditures in 2001, which was conducted in
April. The responses signaled a noticeable downshift in spending plans, with
substantially more firms anticipating a decrease in their nominal capital
expenditures relative to 2000 than planning an increase. The level of the
diffusion index in April was 33, a downward revision of 15.5 points from
December's level and the lowest reading since May 1982. These data point to a
noticeably smaller expansion of manufacturing capacity in 2001 than we had
assumed at the beginning of the year.5
Motor vehicles. Sales of new light vehicles have been well maintained this
year, averaging an annual rate of 17 million units in the first quarter and a still-
brisk 16-1/2 million units in April. Retail sales, though down in April, continue
to be supported by hefty incentives, which have helped to counter the drag from
weak consumer confidence; incentives are expected to remain sizable over the
next couple of months. Fleet sales, which soared in the first quarter because of
an acceleration in the timing of deliveries by General Motors and Chrysler,
moved closer to normal levels in April, and further declines are likely in coming
months, reflecting a payback for last winter's spike in deliveries.
The recent decline in overall sales has been concentrated at the Big Three, and
their market share, which had turned up earlier in the year, dropped back to
63 percent in April. Indeed, sales of both transplants and imports have held up
very well, even though these manufacturers have offered much smaller and less
widespread incentives than the Big Three. Upbeat reviews on current models,
particularly on those of some of the smaller Asian firms, coupled with ongoing
favorable exchange rates, have likely fueled some of the recent strength in sales
of foreign nameplates.
Sales of medium and heavy trucks were little changed in March and averaged
482,000 units (BEA basis) at an annual rate in the first quarter, the lowest level
since early 1998. Moreover, preliminary new orders in April suggest that
demand remains quite weak. Orders for heavy trucks ticked up but remained at
5. Manufacturing capacity increased at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, on average, from 1995
to 2000; our initial projection for 2001 was 3.5 percent. A downward-revised estimate of
manufacturing capacity will be incorporated in our regular IP release on May 14.

a depressed level, while orders for medium trucks fell further. Backlogs have
changed little on balance since late last year.
The overhang in inventories of motor vehicles that developed late last year was
largely worked off by the end of the first quarter. However, with production up
further in April and with sales down, days' supply increased a bit, especially for
light trucks. Current assembly schedules point to little change in production in

May and a rise in June. However, with sales expected to ease further,
automakers likely will trim these plans some. Nonetheless, because of
commitments to parts suppliers, cutbacks in production could be insufficient to
keep inventories in line with sales. Consequently, the re-emergence of a
moderate inventory overhang by the end of the quarter, particularly for light
trucks, cannot be ruled out; indeed, days' supply of light trucks in April-at
75 days-already was a bit above the industry's target range of 65 to 70 days.

II-13
Consumer Spending and Income
Although consumer spending has decelerated appreciably since last year, real
PCE still increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the first quarter. In
addition to the surge in spending on motor vehicles, last quarter's gain was
boosted by continued strong outlays for non-auto durables and a moderate
increase in spending on nondurables. Spending on services rose more slowly,
reflecting both a weather-related drop in energy services and only a modest
increase in non-energy services.
The relatively solid pace of growth in PCE in the first quarter was somewhat
surprising in light of rather weak fundamentals for the household sector.
Among the more prominent of these influences, sagging demand in the labor
market and higher energy prices have restrained the growth of real personal
income, the soft stock market has continued to push down the ratio of household
net worth to disposable income, and consumer sentiment has deteriorated.
Notwithstanding last quarter's spending figures, these weak fundamentals likely
are signaling a downshift in the rate of increase in real PCE. Indeed, although
we do not want to read too much into the monthly pattern of these volatile data,
the first-quarter increase in PCE reflected a strong gain in January, followed by
a fairly flat trajectory for spending in February and March.
Real disposable income rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter,
and the personal saving rate declined to -1 percent-a new postwar quarterly
low. Over the three years ending in the first quarter, the saving rate dropped
5 percentage points-more than in any other three-year period during the past
forty years. Our econometric models explain most of this fall in the saving rate
as a consequence of the stock-market boom experienced over the latter half of
the 1990s.6 In addition, to the extent that households viewed the reduction in
real income arising from recent increases in energy prices as temporary, they
may have tended to maintain their level of real consumption by letting their
saving fall. That said, the saving rate was unexpectedly low in the first quarter
6. According to our models, households respond only gradually to a sustained increase in
their wealth caused by rising equity prices (holding all other factors constant). Therefore, even
though the Wilshire 5000 reached its peak level in March 2000-and has since fallen nearly
25 percent-the models imply that, after taking account of earlier gains, the stock market was
boosting household spending (and lowering the saving rate) through late last year.

of this year.7 On a monthly basis, the saving rate has risen since January, which
would seem consistent with the deterioration in household balance sheets and
the declines in consumer sentiment.
According to both the Conference Board and the Michigan Survey Research
Center, consumer sentiment dipped again last month. Respondents noticeably
downgraded their assessments of current economic conditions, and near-term
expectations weakened a bit as well. Both surveys reported a more pessimistic
outlook for the labor market later this year.
Housing Markets
Buoyed by low mortgage rates, housing activity has remained robust in recent
months. Single-family housing starts fell to an annual rate of 1.24 million units
in March but still averaged a 1.3 million unit pace in the first quarter-the
strongest quarterly reading in a year. The drop in starts in March almost
certainly was exaggerated by the weather-related boost to construction in the
previous two months. In addition, adjusted permits-which typically provide
more reliable insight about near-term trends in this sector-were strong relative
to starts, suggesting that part of the March drop may simply have reflected
sampling variability.
Sales of new and existing homes also have remained brisk in recent months. In
March, existing home sales were only a touch below the record of June 1999,
and new home sales reached a new high. The rapid pace of sales in March drew
the inventory of new homes for sale down to 300,000 units, which is the
smallest stock since early 1999. Unless the pace of sales moderates, builders
may need to increase construction in coming months just to maintain their
desired level of inventory.
Likely reflecting the continued strength of housing demand, home prices have
been rising faster than overall inflation. The constant-quality price index for
7. The saving rate, however, often looks quite different after revisions to the national
accounts. In fact, the BEA has announced that data now available from state unemployment
insurance records would lead them to raise their estimate of last year's growth in wage and
salary income by roughly $75 billion. All else equal, this would raise the saving rate in 2000 by
1 percentage point. This change will be incorporated in the NIPA with the regular annual
revision scheduled for July. Of course, other components of personal income and outlays are
also subject to revision this summer.

new homes rose about 4 percent over the year ending in the first quarter, and
the repeat-sales price index for existing homes was up nearly 9 percent.8 That
said, the share of income required to finance a home purchase has fallen in
recent quarters, as mortgage rates have dropped back after last year's bulge;
recent readings on affordability are near the favorable end of the range seen over
the past decade.9 Furthermore, the proportion of respondents interviewed for the
Michigan consumer surveys in March and April that mentioned low mortgage
rates as a reason that it was a good time to buy a home jumped to 56 percent, an
unusually high level.
In the multifamily sector, housing starts increased 10-1/2 percent in March, to
an annual rate of 372,000 units, the most rapid pace since early last year. For
the first quarter as a whole, multifamily starts were 3-1/2 percent above the
average for all of last year. Moreover, conditions in the market for multifamily
housing continue to be conducive to new construction. The vacancy rate for
multifamily rental units in the first quarter held near its low year-earlier level,
and rents and property values rose rapidly through the end of last year.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real spending on equipment and software posted its
second straight decline in the first quarter. Apart from an increase in purchases
of cars and trucks by businesses, spending was weak, reflecting unfavorable
investment fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and deteriorating
earnings, especially for high-tech firms. Indeed, real spending on high-tech
items declined last quarter for the first time since the 1990 recession. Outside
the high-tech sector, real outlays on equipment such as industrial machinery
were flat last quarter. Despite the recent strength in the dollar, a noticeable
fraction of the weakness in spending apparently reflects reduced demand for
8. The repeat-sales price index is jointly produced by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. An
essentially identical index published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight
(OFHEO) is used by the Flow of Funds section to estimate housing wealth.
9. The cash-flow burden of home ownership (chart) is based on the rate on thirty-year fixed-
rate mortgages. Of course, the average cost of financing a new home also reflects rates on
adjustable-rate mortgages and the mix of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. FRM rates were
about the same in April as in January, while ARM rates have fallen 55 basis points. However,
the ARM share of mortgage originations in February and March (most recent data) was
10 percent, one of the lowest levels on record.

imported equipment, as real imports of capital goods-particularly aircraft,
computers, and communications equipment-fell dramatically last quarter.
Recent data on new orders point to some further slippage in equipment spending
in the second quarter. In particular, the nominal value of new orders for
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts fell 1.8 percent in March.
Bookings for communications equipment dipped again, continuing the
downward trend that has been evident since the middle of last year. There also
was little prospective support for spending, on balance, outside the high-tech
area, as orders fell for a second month and backlogs edged down. In general,
backlogs have been buoyed in recent months by the sustained strength in orders
for engines and turbines, which take a long time to complete. Excluding
engines and turbines, backlogs for non-high-tech capital goods declined
0.7 percent in March, extending a steep downtrend that has been evident since
last fall.
Nonresidential construction. Spending on nonresidential construction
continued to expand rapidly in the first quarter. The increase was led by a surge
in expenditures for drilling and mining that was primarily associated with
increased exploration for natural gas. Expenditures on private nonresidential
buildings also rose sharply again, reaching a level nearly 7-3/4 percent higher in
real terms than in the first quarter of last year; gains were sizable for most major
categories of buildings.
Prospects for construction in coming quarters are mixed. In the office sector,
vacancies are still low despite the rapid pace of building in recent quarters, and
property values and rents for office buildings continued to increase at double-
digit rates through the fourth quarter (most recent data). However, prospects for
the rest of the commercial sector are less favorable: Although property values
and rents for warehouses have continued to rise moderately, year-over-year
increases for retail space have slowed appreciably from the pace of the
preceding few years. And in the industrial sector, recent anecdotes indicate that
the slowdown in manufacturing activity is starting to restrain the demand for
space. That said, industrial construction has been robust since the end of 1999,
the vacancy rate remains at a moderate level, and existing space continues to be
absorbed at a brisk pace. One factor likely helping to buoy industrial
construction has been the apparent surge in construction of facilities for electric

power generation by private utilities and for cogeneration of power by industrial
companies.
Financial market conditions continue to be generally favorable for
nonresidential construction, although there are reports of slowing demand and
increased caution in funding projects. Issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) remained robust in the first quarter. The rates paid by
borrowers on CMBS have been about unchanged, on balance, from January
through early May, and spreads relative to the ten-year swap rate have been
about flat, suggesting that investors' views of the risk of lending for commercial
construction have not changed appreciably. The delinquency rate on CMBS
edged up a bit in the first quarter, but it remains at a low level; delinquency rates
on commercial mortgages held by life insurance companies were quite low
through the fourth quarter. More recently, commercial banks have continued to
tighten their standards for commercial mortgage loans, as indicated by the
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey for the three months ended in late April.
The net proportion of banks that reported having tightened their credit standards
for commercial mortgage loans was 40 percent, only a bit less than the
45 percent that reported tightening in the January sampling.10
Business inventories. Stockbuilding in the nonfarm business sector fell in real
terms in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp liquidation in motor vehicle stocks
and essentially no change, on balance, in other nonfarm stocks." All else equal,
we estimate that the downswing in inventory investment between the fourth and
first quarters lowered real GDP growth in the first quarter about 3 percentage
points, with the negative contribution divided roughly equally between the
motor vehicle and other sectors. Given this pattern of stockbuilding, broad
inventory-sales ratios have receded a bit after having moved up in the second
10. A related question regarding changes in loan demand over the three months indicated
somewhat weaker demand, on net, for commercial real estate loans to finance several types of
structures, including office buildings, hotels, and retail, warehouse, and industrial facilities. The
demand for loans for multifamily housing was reported to be unchanged.
11. The advance NIPA estimates showed an $11 billion increase (annual rate) in real
nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles. However, subsequent data on the book value of
manufacturing inventories imply a sizable downward revision to that figure. The incoming
information on wholesale inventories did not differ greatly from BEA's assumptions.

half of last year, but stocks of many products are still bloated at some point in
the distribution channel.
In manufacturing, sharp liquidations in the book value of inventories in
February and March helped to prevent further deterioration in the inventory
situation. Nonetheless, overhangs in the sector remain sizable, and the overall
inventory-shipments ratio for manufacturing-at 1.34 months in March-is still
well above its level of a year ago. Among key industries, the inventory-to-
shipments ratios for metals and machinery remain very high, but they have
flattened recently after having climbed markedly over the preceding several
months.
Excluding motor vehicles, the book value of wholesale inventories increased at
an annual rate of $8 billion in March after having decreased over the preceding
three months. The increase in stocks in March reflects a surge at drug
wholesalers. As at the manufacturing level, inventory-sales ratios for metals
and for electrical machinery have recently held fairly steady at elevated levels.
Information for the retail sector is only available through February. It shows a
further easing of the inventory-sales ratio for retailers of durable goods other
than motor vehicles, which had risen sharply late last year. Inventory-sales
ratios for other non-auto retailers have been about unchanged over the past year.
Government Expenditures
Federal sector. Improvements in the surplus have slowed in recent months.
Outlays have continued to rise at an annual rate of roughly 4 percent, about the
same as during fiscal year 2000 as a whole. But receipts have decelerated
sharply after having risen about 10 percent last year.
Some of the deceleration in receipts originates in the corporate sector and
reflects the deterioration in corporate profits that began late last year.
According to monthly Treasury data for February and March and daily data for
April, net corporate payments over those months were about 12 percent lower
than payments made during the same period a year ago, as gross payments fell
and refunds soared.

Daily Treasury data indicate that April/May individual nonwithheld receipts,
which are largely payments on the previous year's liability, were roughly
10 percent higher than those received last year. As a result, liabilities appear to
have risen considerably faster than the NIPA tax base for another year in 2000,
and the effective tax rate moved up further. We do not know the extent to
which this increased effective tax rate reflects real bracket creep, higher capital
gains (distributions of capital gains by mutual funds were strong during 2000),
shifts in income distribution, or potential underestimates by the BEA of taxable
income. However, as noted, the BEA has indicated that, all else equal, the
unemployment insurance data now available imply an upward revision to the
published estimate of last year's wage and salary income.
The House of Representatives passed the budget resolution agreed to by the
conference committee. This resolution includes $1.25 trillion in tax cuts over
2002-11 and $100 billion in near-term stimulatory tax cuts. The resolution also
provides $300 billion for a Medicare prescription drug benefit as well as
increased spending on agricultural subsidies.
State and local governments. Real consumption and investment spending by
state and local governments appears to have risen at a hefty annual rate of
4-1/2 percent in the first quarter, once we adjust the advance NIPA estimate to
take account of the monthly construction data that were released on May 1.
According to these data, real construction rose sharply in the first quarter largely
on the strength of a rebound in highway construction after three quarters of
declines. In addition, real state and local consumption expenditures increased at
their fastest pace in five years as employment in this sector surged. Employment
in April advanced further, with sizable gains recorded on local payrolls.
Anecdotes suggest that states will continue to run surpluses in fiscal 2001, but
they will be smaller than projected at the start of the fiscal year, and some states
are trimming expectations for next year.12 Most of the reports in the Bond Buyer
in the past month point to lower-than-expected tax revenue as being the main
culprit. Reports from a few midwestern states indicate that some governments
are dealing with the weakness by asking agencies to reduce expenditures.
Meanwhile, California is being affected by a softening in sales tax receipts and

withheld tax payments as well as by the state's power subsidies, which were
estimated by the BEA to have been $3.8 billion in the first quarter; however,
final payments this spring on taxpayers' liabilities for 2000 were strong.
Prices
Core consumer price inflation was on the high side in the first quarter and,
sorting through the various measures, appears to have picked up slightly over the
past year. However, overall consumer price inflation has declined or remained
roughly flat over this period, held down by a significant deceleration in energy
prices.
Retail energy prices turned down in March. Despite mid-March cuts in OPEC
production quotas, spot prices of West Texas crude oil fell $2 per barrel from the
beginning of March through the end of the month, and the decline contributed to
a drop in the wholesale and retail prices of gasoline and heating oil. Conditions
in natural gas markets provided further relief: As the end of winter neared, U.S.
natural gas demand dropped, and spot prices for natural gas fell sharply. This
decline in spot prices was reflected in residential natural gas bills for March.
However, more recent information points toward a rebound in energy prices in
April, with especially large increases for electricity and gasoline. With regard to
electricity, California's public utility commission boosted residential rates
sharply at the end of March, and this increase will likely raise the national
electricity price index in April by about 1-1/2 percent. California's capacity
problems, along with hydropower shortages in the Northwest, show no sign of
immediate easing; the continued supply shortfall may lead to further blackouts in
the region this spring and summer, and perhaps further residential rate increases
in California. In contrast, capacity in the rest of the country has risen
substantially over the past year and appears quite adequate to meet the normal
seasonal rise in demand.
Concerns about lean inventories have pushed up gasoline prices in the past few
weeks, with wholesale and retail prices hitting record highs in the first week of
May. So far this year, the supply of gasoline has been similar to that of early
2000, despite several refineries having been closed for repairs or shut down
permanently. But with consumption having surged recently, gasoline inventories
have been drawn down significantly. Moreover, stocks for MTBE, an additive

used in 10 percent of the reformulated gasoline (RFG) sold during the summer,
are very low, which is adding another 2 cents or 3 cents per gallon to RFG
prices. Despite the current high prices, futures quotes point to a sharp decline in
wholesale gasoline prices over the next few months. This probably reflects the
expectation of market participants that gasoline production capacity will soon be
restored and that inventory levels will move back into their normal range.
Excluding food and energy items, PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in March after
having risen 0.3 percent in both January and February. On a quarterly average
basis, core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter,
compared with a 1.6 percent annual rate increase in the preceding quarter. About
half of this step-up reflects a faster rate of increase in the nonmarket component
of the index (that is, the portion of the index that is not computed using market-
based prices). Still, the quarterly average increase in core market-based prices
also moved up in the first quarter, as did the change in the core CPI. Over the
past year or so, core PCE inflation has been about flat on net. However, there
has been a modest acceleration in the core current-methods CPI and, to a lesser
extent, in market-based core PCE prices over this period.
Capital goods prices (as measured by the producer price index) were unchanged
over the first three months of 2001, held down in part by plunging computer
prices. Based on anecdotes as well as the recent co-movement of computer
prices and the capacity utilization rate for the semiconductor industry, the recent
large drop in computer prices appears related to the weakening of demand
evident in the high-tech sector.13 The total PPI for capital goods rose nearly
1 percent over the year ending in March after having risen 0.6 percent over the
previous year.
Turning to broader measures of inflation, the GDP chain-type price index rose at
an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter, pushed up by higher PCE prices.
In addition, the reduction in the price of imported petroleum was not matched by
13. In April, press reports indicated that Intel was starting to sharply reduce the prices of its
microprocessors. Advanced Micro Devices-Intel's major rival in this market-appears likely
to follow Intel's lead with its own round of price cuts. This raises the prospect of additional
large declines in computer prices in the near term.

price declines for domestic energy goods and services.14 Over the past four
quarters, GDP prices rose 2.3 percent, an acceleration of 1/2 percentage point
from a year ago; by contrast, the rate of increase in the price index for gross
domestic purchases-which is defined as the prices paid for consumption,
investment, and government purchases-changed little on net over this period.
Excluding food and energy, the latest four-quarter changes in both GDP and
gross domestic purchases prices were also roughly the same as a year ago.
At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate
materials rose 1 percent over the twelve months ending in March after having
posted a 3 percent increase over the same period a year ago. This deceleration in
the prices of core intermediate goods appears consistent with the indirect effects
of recent swings in energy prices, domestic industrial activity, and the prices of
imported goods.15 Prices of core crude materials have decelerated even more
sharply over this period: The PPI for core crude materials fell 11 percent over
the twelve months ending in March, compared with a 16 percent increase over
the previous twelve-month period. Core crude materials prices continued to fall
in March, posting a 1-1/4 percent decline in that month.
Indexes of industrial materials prices (such as the Commodity Research Bureau
and Journal of Commerce commodity price indexes) initially declined following
the March PPI pricing date, but then moved up on net after early April. Like the
PPI for crude materials, these commodity price indexes have declined over the
past year-although generally not as rapidly. Of course, these indexes are
narrower in scope, and we would not expect them to closely match movements in
the PPI, which likely provides a better measure of industrial materials costs.
Inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have edged up a touch recently.
The median expectation for inflation over the coming year stood at 3.1 percent in
April, which is on the high side of the band in which measured expectations have
14. Because the GDP price index measures the price of domestic output, import prices are
subtracted from the index. If a reduction in the price of imported intermediate goods is not
matched by a decline in the price of domestic final output (perhaps because domestic producers
have increased their margins), measured GDP prices will rise.
15. A statistical model relating the quarterly percent change in the PPI for core intermediate
goods to changes in energy prices, core imported goods prices, and the rate of manufacturing
capacity utilization closely tracks the runup in intermediate goods price inflation in 1999 and its
subsequent decline in 2000.

fluctuated over the past year or so. Median expected inflation over the next five
to ten years was also 3.1 percent; this is the highest it has been since March of
last year.
Labor Costs
Hourly compensation has accelerated over the past couple of years, as tight labor
markets and the lagged effects of higher consumer price inflation have continued
to put upward pressure on wage inflation. However, as is often the case, various
measures of wage inflation have not moved together over shorter periods; these
differences across the series are mainly differences of timing and are not as large
when the series are compared over several years. Specifically, in the first
quarter, the four-quarter change in compensation per hour in the productivity and
costs data picked up further, while the twelve-month change in the ECI for
hourly compensation dropped back a bit after having been boosted by sharp
increases early last year.
As measured by the productivity and costs data, hourly compensation rose
5.2 percent in the first quarter, lifting the four-quarter change in this measure to
6 percent; this is 1.5 percentage points higher than a year ago.16 Average hourly
earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.4 percent in April; this
put the twelve-month change in this measure of wages at 4.3 percent, compared
with a year-earlier twelve-month change of 3.8 percent.
The employment cost index for hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of
4.6 percent in the first quarter; this increase was larger than those of recent
quarters and reflected a 4.4 percent rise in wages and a 5.9 percent increase in
benefit costs. The rise in benefit costs in part reflected another big increase in
employer payments for health insurance, which have risen 8 percent over the past
16. As noted earlier, the BEA announced that tabulations of state unemployment insurance
data imply a change in wage and salary disbursements from 1999 to 2000 that is about
$75 billion greater than current NIPA estimates. (Anecdotal evidence suggests that this
additional compensation is at least partly related to a surge in stock option exercises in 2000.)
Although it is impossible to know precisely what impact the revision to wages and salaries will
have on the measured growth of P&C hourly compensation over this period, a very rough
calculation indicates that the order of magnitude of this upward revision (combined with the
effect of BLS revisions to measured employment growth) is about 1 percentage point.

year.17 Over the twelve months ending in March, the ECI for hourly
compensation rose 4.2 percent, 0.4 percentage point less than a year ago. A
reduction in the rate of compensation growth for sales workers, whose pay
includes a substantial commission component, more than accounts for the
deceleration in the ECI.
As was noted above, focusing on these recent movements in the ECI paints a
slightly misleading picture of wage trends inasmuch as comparisons with a year
ago are affected by the surge in the ECI that occurred in the first quarter of last
year. Over the past two years, the acceleration in the ECI for hourly
compensation, at roughly 1-1/4 percentage points, is similar to the acceleration in
the productivity and costs measure of compensation per hour. Likewise, the two-
year acceleration in the ECI for wages and salaries of production or
nonsupervisory workers is broadly similar to the acceleration in average hourly
earnings over this period.
17. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has approved an
average increase in HMO rates of 6 percent for 2002 (the corresponding increase for 2001 was
9 percent). The increase was substantially reduced by changes in copayments for drugs and
office visits; absent this shifting of costs to employees, premiums would reportedly have risen by
13 percent. (We will not know the overall increase in CalPERS premiums until mid-May, when
rates for preferred provider plans are determined.)

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
The 100 basis points of reduction in the federal funds rate since mid-March was
considerably more than had been built into market interest rates. This, along
with more recent weakness evident in labor markets, contributed to declines in
short-term interest rates generally of more than 70 basis points over the
intermeeting period, and markets reduced noticeably the low point of the federal
funds rate expected to be reached later this year. Judging from futures market
prices and market surveys, investors expect 50 basis points of additional easing
at the May FOMC meeting and attach high odds to a further 25 basis point
reduction in the federal funds rate by the fall.
Despite the expectation of more near-term easing, long-term Treasury rates
moved up more than 40 basis points in the intermeeting period, apparently
reflecting some greater optimism about prospects for the economy beyond the
near term, based on the scope of previous and expected future monetary policy
actions. The rise in Treasury yields also appeared to reflect increased concern
about inflationary pressures. According to survey data, long-term inflation
expectations edged up, and inflation compensation derived from TIIS yields
moved somewhat higher. However, this rise only reverses the decline that
occurred in late 2000.
Although companies continued to report weak profits for the first quarter,
earnings mostly beat substantially lowered expectations, which, along with
greater confidence in renewed economic growth, boosted equity prices
substantially over the intermeeting period. Apparently reflecting improved
perceptions of business prospects, private long-term debt instruments
outperformed Treasuries, despite continued evidence of deteriorating corporate
credit quality, and bond issuance, both investment grade and speculative, has
remained strong. In contrast, C&I loans and commercial paper have continued
to run off in recent months, and, on net, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses
has slowed this year. Equity issuance also has been muted. Meanwhile,
household borrowing remained brisk in the first quarter, buoyed by strong
mortgage refinancings as households reportedly sought to finance new outlays
by extracting equity from their homes and to consolidate debt payments. The
cumulative effect of four monetary easings since early January contributed to a
continuation of rapid growth in the broad monetary aggregates in March and
April.
Business Finance
The major stock indexes have risen 7 percent to 13 percent since the March
FOMC meeting. Stock prices began to increase in early April and seemed to
gain momentum from the intermeeting cut in the federal funds rate, which
evidently eased investors' fears of recession. The initial upturn in equity prices
occurred as many companies reported first-quarter operating earnings that

topped pre-report forecasts. However, analysts had been aggressively lowering
estimates in advance of those reports. Indeed, expected year-ahead earnings
were revised down more than 4 percent in April, the largest monthly negative
revision in more than fifteen years. With almost 90 percent of S&P 500 reports
now in, it appears that first-quarter earnings per share declined about 11 percent
from results four quarters earlier, following a 4-3/4 percent gain in the fourth
quarter.
A good deal of the earnings weakness can be attributed to the technology sector,
for which net income in the first quarter was 40 percent below the year-earlier
level and for which expected year-ahead earnings were taken down about
20 percent in April. Looking further ahead, five-year growth forecasts for
technology firms in the S&P 500, although still quite high by past standards,
continued to tilt down over the intermeeting period. Nonetheless, the rebound in
stock prices was particularly strong for technology companies, and the price-
earnings ratio for S&P 500 technology firms has bounced back above thirty-
five, a historically rich valuation. Investor nervousness about valuation levels is
reflected in the volatility of stock prices, which remains at almost twice its
historical average. In contrast, outside the technology sector, five-year growth
forecasts have yet to show any downturn.
With most equity indexes still far below their highs of 2000, the pace of gross
equity issuance by nonfinancial firms has remained fairly light. There were few
IPOs in March and April, and the only large IPO, by Agere, a spinoff from
Lucent, raised only a tenth of the amount intended when plans were announced
a year ago. Seasoned issuance has been moderate, fueled somewhat by energy
and oil firms. Equity retirements have also slowed. Announcements of new
share repurchase programs and cash-financed acquisitions were sparse in April,
likely owing to weak profits and a depletion of cash. Retirements from mergers
have also been affected by a steep falloff in European buyers' demand to
purchase U.S. companies.
Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds has continued at a rapid
pace, as firms have taken advantage of attractive interest rates, mostly to fund
planned capital expenditures, but also to pay down commercial paper. Almost a
third of the bonds issued during March and April had maturities exceeding
twelve years, a substantially higher proportion than last year and about the same
as in the first quarter. Issuance in March was boosted by a $6 billion offering of
AT&T Wireless early in the month. However, the AT&T deal priced far worse
than other bonds with similar ratings, and telecom issuance generally has
dropped off. Oil and energy firms, on the other hand, have stepped up their pace
of bond issuance. With junk-bond yields holding above their recent lows in
February and early March, issuance of junk bonds has remained off its pace of
early this year; however, issuance remains above its average pace in 2000 owing
to a stream of offerings from transportation and public utilities companies.

The commercial paper market has settled down some since the California utility
defaults in January and $16 billion of net downgrades in the first quarter shook
investor confidence. The runoff in paper has slowed, and the spread of yields on
one-month A2/P2 over A1/P1 paper fell 26 basis points over the intermeeting
period. However, outstanding tier 2 paper remains about 30 percent below its
November peak, suggesting that some relatively risky issuers remain shut out of
the market. In the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks
reported, on net, that they were applying stricter standards for approving
requests for commercial paper backup lines of credit, especially for A2/P2
issuers, than they were a year ago. Approximately four-fifths of domestic
respondents indicated that they considered these lines to be profitable overall,
but most of the remaining banks reported that they expected more than minor
declines in the volume of this business as a result of increases in fees and
spreads associated with these credit lines.
On net, Moody's downgraded $224 billion of nonfinancial debt in the first
quarter, and large downgrades in April suggest that the pace has not abated. The
downgrades during the first quarter were widespread, outnumbering upgrades by
a ratio of three to one, and Moody's Watchlist suggests that the number of
downgrades will continue to exceed the number of upgrades in the coming
months.
In the first quarter, the twelve-month trailing default rate on junk bonds
continued to climb, to a near-record 9.07 percent. The rate was boosted
markedly by the huge defaults of Finova Capital and Southern California
Edison, but there were widespread defaults by smaller firms as well. Business
failures have also increased substantially this year, and with the bankruptcy
filing of PG&E in April, the ratio of failed to total liabilities has risen to its
highest level since 1992. Looking ahead, a staff model suggests that the junk
bond default rate will be sustained near its recent high level in the year ahead,
with the forecast boosted recently by bond rating downgrades and the elevated
volatility of stock prices.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
Interest rates on AAA-rated commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
have risen in line with those for comparable ten-year swaps since the last FOMC
meeting, leaving spreads about unchanged. Preliminary estimates indicate that

CMBS issuance for the first quarter was similar to the average rate in 2000.1
Growth in commercial mortgage debt from all sources is estimated to have
remained fairly brisk in the first quarter.
Some signs of credit problems in this sector have emerged, with delinquency
rates on CMBS creeping up in recent months from the historically low levels of
last year. Low vacancy rates for commercial buildings suggest that to date this
deterioration is not occurring against the backdrop of an overbuilt market, as it
did in the early 1990s, although market commentary indicates that in some
places demand is weakening relative to supply. Moreover, the most recent
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey points to somewhat weaker demand for
commercial real estate loans over the past three months, particularly demand for
loans to finance office buildings and industrial structures.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury auctioned $43 billion in two-, five-, and ten-year notes and $114
billion in cash management bills over the intermeeting period. At its
mid-quarter refunding, the Treasury announced plans to introduce a four-week
bill before the end of the current fiscal year. The Treasury expects the four-
week bill to provide it with greater flexibility and cost efficiency in managing its
increasingly volatile cash balances, allowing it to reduce dependence on cash
management bills. Cash management bills are said to be especially expensive
forms of borrowing given their irregular pattern of issuance.
Buybacks totaled $6.75 billion over the intermeeting period and are on schedule
to meet the $10 billion target for the second quarter. The second-quarter target
for debt buybacks was upwardly revised from $9 million, and the Treasury also
announced a $10 billion buyback target for the third quarter. Markets were a bit
surprised by the larger size of the buybacks, given recent statements by
Administration officials about maintaining a viable government bond market
even if future federal budget surpluses were large enough effectively to retire
the debt.
The Treasury also announced in its mid-quarter refunding statement that it was
considering changes in the so-called "35 percent rule," which limits bidding in
auctions by those having claims on large amounts of an issue. With re-opening
increasingly being used to maintain liquidity in individual issues, this rule was
constraining many potential bidders. The private-sector committee advising
1. In the current quarter, issuance may be held down by uncertainty over new Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting rules governing securitizations that went into
effect on April 1. As yet, the exact limitations imposed by the rules are somewhat unclear, but
some interpretations would sharply increase the tax liability associated with certain transactions.
FASB is now working to clarify the standards, and securities issuers are reportedly deferring
deals until the uncertainty is resolved.

Treasury on debt management recommended dropping inflation-indexed
securities owing to their relatively high cost. The Treasury is expected to
announce the fate of both the indexed securities and the thirty-year bond in
August.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to issue a substantial volume of
Benchmark and Reference securities over the intermeeting period. Both also
announced buyback programs for off-the-run Benchmark and Reference notes
and bonds, evidently to help maintain funding flexibility while continuing their
commitments to regular debt issuance under the two programs. The buybacks
will also enable the GSEs to better match the duration of their assets and
liabilities, given recently increased mortgage prepayments.
As expected, agency subordinated debt received a regulatory risk weighting of
20 percent from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council rather
than the 100 percent risk weighting assigned to non-agency corporate debt.
Subsequently, Fannie Mae priced its second subordinated debt issue. The
spread between ten-year agency subordinated debt and ten-year Fannie Mae
Benchmark debt has narrowed about 4 basis points since the March FOMC
meeting, to 24 basis points.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was brisk in March, boosted by
strong refundings of existing debt, before tailing off in April. Governments also
took advantage of the lower rates to issue bonds to raise new capital. Credit
quality of the municipal sector remained very high, with upgrades again
outpacing downgrades by a ratio of more than two to one. Significant among
the downgrades, however, was Standard and Poor's lowering of the rating of
California's $27 billion general obligation bonds; S&P cited the lack of
resolution of the state's energy crisis and the likely adverse effects of the crisis
on the state's economy. Following long-term Treasury rates, municipal yields
edged up in April, though they remained quite low by historical standards.
Household Finance
Available data indicate that household debt continued to expand at a brisk pace
in the first quarter, although the monthly pattern for consumer credit showed
some slowing, particularly for non-revolving credit. With debt growth having
far outstripped income growth in recent quarters, the household debt-service
burden has risen considerably over the past year, putting the estimated
first-quarter value about equal to its twenty-year high of around 14-1/2 percent.
Recent declines in interest rates paid by consumers and relatively low levels of
mortgage interest rates should hold down the increase in the debt-service burden
going forward.

Household credit quality has deteriorated somewhat this year. The delinquency
rate for credit card loans in securitized pools has been rising since late last year,
with the most recent readings the highest in about two years. However, the most
recent data for auto loans at finance companies has stayed at the low end of its
recent range. In the May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks that had
tightened credit standards on consumer loans pointed to an expected increase in
consumer delinquency rates as an important reason. Household bankruptcy
filings have popped up in recent weeks, although press accounts suggest that a
good portion of this rise may reflect a rush to file before the likely enactment of
bankruptcy reform by Congress.2
The market value of total household assets declined again in the first quarter.
The ratio of household assets to disposable income has fallen steadily since the
beginning of 2000 and now stands at its lowest level since mid-1998. This
deterioration reflects the weak performance of the stock market over this period,
as the value of assets other than equities is estimated to have risen modestly
relative to disposable income over the past twelve months.
Equity mutual funds experienced substantial outflows in March, followed by
only a partial reversal in April. In contrast, bond funds have attracted
considerable amounts of new funds in recent months, on average, and net flows
of new funds to retail money funds have been stronger than they usually are at
this time of year. The share of new contributions to 401(k) pension plans
allocated to equities remained about constant through March, but transfer
activity ran high, with substantial net outflows from equity funds.
Money and Bank Credit
The broad monetary aggregates continued to expand rapidly in March and April,
with M2 and M3 registering double-digit growth in each month. M2 posted
14-1/2 percent growth in March and 10-1/4 percent in April. The sharp easing
in the stance of monetary policy since the start of the year has resulted in a
significant drop in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets. In addition to the
strength in retail money funds, growth of liquid deposits has been particularly
brisk, while small time deposits have run off. Both reflect the typical responses
to declines in short-term interest rates. The recent growth in M2 has also been
boosted by special factors, including a surge in mortgage refinancing activity
(which results in prepayments that temporarily accumulate in deposit accounts
before being distributed to investors in mortgage-backed securities) and higher
final tax payments than were implicitly built into seasonal factors. In addition,
M2 growth has likely continued to benefit from the heightened volatility of
equity markets in recent months.
2. The two houses of Congress passed different versions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of
2001 in March; a conference committee is now being formed to negotiate a compromise.

M3 was buoyed by growth of institutional money funds, as the rates on these
instruments adjust with a lag to declining market rates. Strong issuance of large
time deposits by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also boosted M3
in April, with the proceeds apparently used in part to reduce obligations to their
offices abroad.
Bank credit was about unchanged in March, but its growth rebounded to a
moderate 5-1/2 percent rate in April. The pickup last month owed to increased
holdings of securities, particularly mortgage-backed securities. Bank loans
grew at a sluggish pace over March and April. The rate of growth of real estate
loans averaged about 5-1/4 percent over these months, primarily because of
robust expansion of residential mortgages. Consumer loans adjusted for
securitization were about flat in March, with the slowdown attributable
importantly to credit card loans made by small banks. These loans recovered in
April, however, and growth of adjusted consumer lending by banks rebounded
to an 8 percent rate.
Business lending by banks, which had surged earlier this year, slumped into
negative territory in March and edged off further in April, perhaps reflecting, in
part, strict bank lending standards, which the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion
Survey indicates were tightened again over the past three months. The survey
also indicated that demand weakened, on net, over the past three months,
primarily as a result of decreased investment in plant and equipment and
reduced need for merger and acquisition financing. In addition, demand had
been boosted earlier in the year, as some businesses apparently tapped backup
credit lines as a substitute for issuing commercial paper. A substitution of long-
term debt for loans also appears to have played a role in limiting demand for
business loans.
The net income of a sample of twenty-five large bank holding companies
declined more than 10 percent in the first quarter of 2001 relative to the same
quarter last year. Profitability was restrained significantly by continued
increases in loan-loss provisioning, owing to further deterioration in credit
quality, which, according to several banks, remains concentrated in their
business loan portfolios. The decline in net income also reflected reduced
income from capital markets activities, particularly at banking organizations that
have substantial venture capital operations.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The May 2001 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices focused
on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses and households
over the past three months. Supplementary questions on the business side addressed
lending and pricing policies for commercial paper backup lines of credit and recent
changes in the composition of demand for commercial real estate loans. On the
household side, additional questions were included in order to discern changes over the
past year in terms on mortgage loans to purchase homes and reasons for changes in
lending standards and terms associated with consumer lending. Loan officers from
fifty-four large domestic banks and twenty-one U.S. branches and agencies of foreign
banks participated in the May survey.
The number of foreign and domestic banking institutions that reported tightening
standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the past three
months remained in the elevated range of the last three regular surveys. A significant
fraction of domestic respondents also noted that they tightened standards for
commercial real estate loans over the same period. In general, both foreign and
domestic institutions indicated that the most important reasons for tightening standards
and terms on C&I loans were a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and
a worsening of industry-specific problems. Compared to the January survey, somewhat
smaller, though still substantial, net fractions of domestic banks reported weaker
demand for both C&I and commercial real estate loans over the past three months.
In view of the recent turmoil in the commercial paper market, a series of special
questions addressed lending and pricing policies for commercial paper backup lines of
credit at commercial banks. All foreign institutions and a large majority of domestic
commercial banks indicated that they provided commercial paper backup lines of credit.
Citing concerns about the credit quality of commercial paper issuers, significant
fractions of both foreign and domestic respondents indicated that they tightened
standards and terms on these credit facilities over the past year, particularly for lower-
rated (A2/P2) borrowers. Most institutions offering these credit facilities noted that
commercial paper backup lines of credit are profitable under current pricing policies,
when account is taken of associated business opportunities.
After a noticeable firming of consumer lending policies reported in the January survey,
similar net fractions of domestic banks tightened their standards and increased spreads
over their cost of funds over the past three months. The most frequently cited reason
for the tightening was a concern about the recent and expected future deterioration in
consumer credit quality. According to the respondents, the demand for consumer loans
of all types picked up in the May survey, with a small net fraction of banks reporting
increased demand over the past three months, compared to the January survey, when
more than one-third of banks noted weaker demand for consumer loans. Almost all
domestic banks reported no change in standards for residential mortgage loans. About
one-half of the respondents noted that demand for residential mortgages had
strengthened during the survey period, a marked contrast to the January survey, which
indicated no net change in demand for this type of loan.

III-A-2
Lending to Businesses
The net percentage of domestic and foreign respondents that tightened standards on
C&I loans during the last quarter backed down some from the January peak. One-half
of domestic banks reported tightening their standards on business loans to large and
middle-market firms over the past three months, compared with 60 percent in January.
For small firms, the percentage of banks tightening fell from 45 percent to 37 percent
between the two surveys. The fraction of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
that reported tightening standards for customers seeking C&I loans also fell in January.
Compared to the January survey, somewhat smaller fractions of domestic banks
reported tightening each of the loan terms listed in the survey. More than 60 percent of
domestic respondents reported charging higher premiums on riskier loans to large and
middle-market firms, down some from almost 75 percent in the last survey. Again, no
banks reported lowering these premiums, but significantly fewer banks than in January
raised them considerably. Almost half of the domestic banks, on net, indicated that
they had increased the cost of credit lines for large and middle-market firms over the
past three months. Almost 40 percent of domestic banks also tightened loan covenants
for these borrowers, compared with about 60 percent in the January survey. Somewhat
smaller net fractions of domestic banks reported tightening these terms on C&I loans to
small firms.
On net, 62 percent of the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported charging
higher premiums on riskier loans over the past three months, about the same as in the
January survey. More than 55 percent of foreign institutions, on net, increased the costs
associated with credit lines, and 48 percent reported a general strengthening of loan
covenants.
Most of the domestic and foreign respondents that had tightened standards or terms on
C&I loans over the previous three months cited a less favorable or more uncertain
economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, and a reduced tolerance
for risk as reasons for changing their lending policies. About half of domestic banks
and more than 80 percent of foreign institutions that had tightened standards and terms
on commercial credits also mentioned an increase in defaults by below-investment-
grade borrowers as contributing to the firming reported over the survey period. In
addition, decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans continued to be a
concern in the May survey.
On net, 43 percent of domestic banks reported weaker demand for C&I loans from large
and middle-market firms, and 37 percent, on net, reported decreased demand from small
firms over the past three months. Most of the domestic banks that reported weaker loan
demand cited a decline in customer demand for credit to finance capital expenditures
and reduced demand for funds to finance mergers and acquisitions. A decline in
internally generated funds was cited as an important reason by six of the seven domestic
respondents that experienced increased C&I loan demand. On net, about 10 percent of
foreign branches and agencies saw weaker demand during the survey period. The
reasons for reduced C&I loan demand cited by the foreign institutions were largely the
same as in the case of domestic banks.

III-A-3
The current survey included a series of special questions that addressed lending and
pricing policies for commercial paper backup lines of credit. Forty-three domestic
institutions (80 percent of those surveyed) and all of the U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks answered these questions. More that one-third of both domestic and
foreign respondents indicated that they tightened standards on these credit facilities for
firms that issued A1/P1-rated commercial paper over the past year. For A2/P2-rated
issuers, almost 60 percent of domestic banks and 70 percent of foreign branches and
agencies reported firmer standards. Over this period, no institution eased standards on
commercial paper backup lines.
In addition to a shift to more stringent credit standards over the past year, large fractions
of domestic and foreign respondents also increased pricing, reduced the size, and
shortened the length of commercial paper backup commitments. During that period, 68
percent of domestic banks widened spreads, and 60 percent raised commitment fees on
these credit facilities for A1/P1-rated issuers. Similarly, more than half of foreign
institutions, on net, reported higher spreads and fees for A1/P1-rated borrowers. For
lower-rated firms, more than 70 percent of domestic and foreign respondents reported
increasing fees and spreads.
According to the institutions that reported tightening standards or terms on backup
facilities over the past year, a heightened concern about a possible deterioration in the
credit quality of the issuers was most often cited as a reason for a shift to firmer lending
policies. In addition, notable net fractions of domestic and foreign respondents pointed
to an increased likelihood of lines being drawn, because of less certain conditions in the
commercial paper market.
Very few institutions reported that commercial paper backup lines of credit made
money on a standalone basis. However, more than four-fifths of domestic and almost
60 percent of foreign respondents indicated that these credit facilities are profitable
when accounting for associated business opportunities. At institutions that claimed
pricing would have to increase from current levels in order to make these lines
profitable, most indicated that the resulting decline in the volume is likely to be
moderate.
More than 40 percent of domestic banks tightened their standards on commercial real
estate loans over the past three months, about the same as in the January survey. The
fraction of foreign institutions that tightened standards on these loans fell from 30
percent in January to less than 10 percent in the current survey. On net, 20 percent of
domestic and 17 percent of foreign respondents noted that demand for these loans
weakened in the first quarter. Except for multi-family or apartment homes, domestic
banks indicated that demand was weaker, on net, for all major components of
commercial real estate, particularly office buildings.

III-A-4
Lending to Households
Over the past three months, banks' credit standards for approving residential mortgage
loans were largely unchanged. According to the domestic respondents, demand for
residential mortgages to purchase homes increased, on net, over the past three months.
However, interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages fell sharply in the last months of 2000
and at the beginning of this year, and banks' answers may have been influenced by the
resulting increase in refinancing activity.
In the current survey, domestic banks were also queried about changes in terms on
mortgage loans to purchase homes over the past year. About 15 percent of banks, on
net, reported increasing the spread of loan rates over their cost of funds during that
period. According to the respondents, most non-price terms on residential mortgages
were essentially unchanged over that period, except for the maximum size of a
mortgage, which increased.
As in the January survey, a number of domestic banks tightened standards and terms for
consumer loans. About 20 percent of banks reported that they had tightened standards
on credit card loans over the past three months, compared with 12 percent in January.
In addition, one-fifth of respondents reduced credit limits on these loans.
For other types of consumer loans, 19 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported
tighter standards, and about one-quarter, on net, increased spreads over their cost of
funds, roughly the same net percentages as in the previous survey. The recent run-up,
or expected future increases, in consumer delinquency rates were most often cited as a
reason for changing consumer-lending policies. On net, demand for consumer loans of
all types was reported as unchanged.

In February, the value of exports of goods and services moved up for the second
consecutive month, with the increase largely due to a jump in aircraft exports.
However, exports in January-February combined were still below the
fourth-quarter average. Sharp declines in exports of automotive products
(largely to Canada), industrial supplies, and semiconductors were only partly
offset by significant increases in exports of aircraft and consumer goods. In
January-February, exports of capital goods other than aircraft and
semiconductors held at about the fourth-quarter average. By area, declines in
exports to countries in Asia, Latin America, and Canada were partly offset by an
increase in exports to Western Europe.
The value of imports plunged a record $5.4 billion in February (not at annual
rate). The fall was widespread across trade categories, with the largest declines
in imported consumer goods, a wide range of high-tech and other machinery, oil
(entirely quantity), and other industrial supplies. Notably, automotive imports
held at about the same level as recorded in December and January. Imports in
January-February were 3 percent lower (not at annual rate) than the
fourth-quarter average. The decline was broadly based (and strongest in
automotive products, high-tech goods, and oil) with only the value of non-oil
industrial supplies and service payments showing an increase.

IV-5
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The BLS oil import price declined 5.9 percent in March, after increasing
slightly in February. For the first quarter, the price of imported oil fell over
40 percent at an annual rate. After declining during March, the spot price of
West Texas Intermediate crude generally moved up during April as a new round
of OPEC supply cuts became effective. In early May, spot WTI has traded
between $27 and $29 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods (and core goods) declined
0.9 percent in March following a similar decline in February (revised). Virtually
all of the declines in non-oil (and core) import prices in both months were from
natural gas. The declines follow two months of sharp price increases, also
driven by the price of natural gas. In March, prices of industrial supplies were
also held down by a decline in prices of imported unfinished metals. Prices for
imported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors), automotive
products, and consumer goods remained flat in March, while prices for imported
foods declined slightly. In the first quarter, the price of imported core goods
rose about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate, almost entirely because of natural gas
prices. In addition, there were small increases in prices of imported automotive
products and consumer goods and declines in prices of imported machinery
(other than computers and semiconductors) and foods.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports declined slightly in March for the second
consecutive month, largely because of declines in the prices of industrial
supplies. With the exception of industrial supplies and consumer goods, prices
of all major categories of exported core goods (which exclude computers and
semiconductors) rose slightly. In the first quarter, prices of core goods exports
were little changed, as increases in prices of machinery, automotive and
agricultural products were offset by declines in prices of industrial supplies and
consumer goods.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserves held in the United States (line 1 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions Table) increased by $19 billion in the first
quarter, reflecting a substantial rise in January. Nearly all the increase owes to
increased holdings by China of Treasury bills and short-term agencies at
FRBNY as these securities were transferred from a custodian in Luxembourg to
the New York bank. Other large increases were reported for Hong Kong ($5
billion), Mexico ($4 billion), and Venezuela ($2 billion). The most significant
downward movement in the quarter was in Argentina's reserves ($6 billion).
This drop came almost entirely in March and coincided with large withdrawals
from the Argentine banking system due to the recent crisis. Declines in the $2

IV-6
billion to $3 billion range were reported for Turkey, Japan, Korea, and
Singapore.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) remained robust in the
first quarter as net purchases of both U.S. agency bonds (line 4b) and corporate
debt (line 4c) set new records. Although corporate funding requirements were
down in the quarter, the decline in the commercial paper market saw firms
shifting to the bond markets for sources of funds. Also, there has been an
increase in the volume of euro-denominated U.S. issues tailored to foreign
investors and placed abroad. Foreign net purchases of U.S. equities (line 4d)
were substantial in the first quarter, especially in January when U.S. equity
prices were rising. Private foreign sales of Treasury securities slowed in the first
quarter. Even the $9 billion in net sales reported in line 4a are somewhat
overstated as they include a portion of the above-mentioned transfer of China's
holdings from a foreign private custodian to FRBNY.
Net U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) picked up in the first quarter
as purchases of equities spiked to $15 billion in March. The spike reflected in
part several significant new foreign listings on the New York Stock Exchange.
Overall, U.S. activity in foreign securities was concentrated in the United
Kingdom, the Caribbean financial centers, and Japan. Net acquisitions arising
from stock swaps (line 5c) slowed to $4 billion for the quarter, reflecting the
seasonal pattern in takeover activity.
The U.S. banking sector (line 3) reported extraordinary net outflows of $105
billion in the first quarter due to widespread increases in U.S. banks' claims on
their own foreign offices. Weekly FRB data indicate the outflows occurred near
the end of the quarter and were largely reversed in April.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the major currencies index was largely unchanged over the
intermeeting period, as a modest appreciation of the dollar against the euro was
counterbalanced by a depreciation of the dollar against the yen, Canadian dollar,
and the Australian dollar. The dollar appreciated somewhat against the euro
early in the intermeeting period as market participants reportedly expressed
concern over the susceptibility of the euro-area to a global economic slowdown,
but depreciated after the FOMC's surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut on
April 18th.The dollar appreciated against the yen early in the intermeeting
period, as signs of additional weakness in the Japanese economy weighed on the
currency. Market participants also expressed disappointment over the lack of
details of the Japanese government's emergency economic plan. However, since
the surprise election of Prime Minister Koizumi, widely viewed among market
participants as a reformer, the dollar has depreciated slightly against the yen.

In contrast to market expectations held at the beginning of the intermeeting
period, the European Central Bank did not adjust its policy stance, and instead
adopted a "wait and see" strategy as euro-area inflation remained above its target
ceiling. The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National
Bank cut their respective policy rates 25 basis points during the period, while
Australia's central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Just before the
March FOMC meeting, the Bank of Japan moved to a reserve targeting policy,

IV-9
which, in effect, returned Japan to zero nominal interest rates, but has not
adjusted its monetary policy stance since.
During the intermeeting period, share prices in the euro area and the United
Kingdom increased 6.8 and 5.3 percent, respectively. Share prices jumped in
most major equity markets following the FOMC's surprise intermeeting move,
in line with the sharp response in the United States. Since the BOJ's de facto
return to the zero-interest-rate policy on March 19th, Japanese share prices have
soared more than 15 percent. Japanese share prices also reacted favorably to the
election of Prime Minister Koizumi. As global equity markets rallied, ten-year
government bond yields rose sharply across most major industrial economies;
however, three-month interest rates declined in most countries. Late in the
period, Japanese ten-year government bond yields declined in response to
reduced expectations for bond issuance under the new government.

The dollar's exchange value against a group of currencies of our other important
trading partners was largely unchanged. Speculation that Argentina may alter its
fixed exchange rate peg or restructure its debt, and a dispute between newly
appointed Economy Minster Cavallo and Argentina's central bank over reserve
requirements, weighed heavily on Latin American financial markets. On

IV-10
balance, the Brazilian real depreciated 3.9 percent against the dollar over the
intermeeting period. In sharp contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated 3.8 percent
against the dollar over the period despite the regional turmoil as Mexican
monetary authorities maintained a relatively tight policy stance. The dollar
appreciated 6.1 percent against the Indonesian rupiah, amid uncertainty
surrounding President Wahid's battle to retain power and Indonesia's current
fiscal problems. The dollar also appreciated against the Turkish lira, not shown,
early in the period amid continued uncertainty about Turkey's economic
situation; however, the lira recovered somewhat after the release of Economic
Minister Dervis' reform plan and the promise of additional official financial
support.

Over the period, equity prices in Asian emerging markets were mixed. Concerns
about the demand for technology exports and prospects for earnings going
forward weighed on the tech-heavy Asian equity markets early in the period, but
prices rebounded sharpy after the FOMC's intermeeting rate cut.
While Latin American equity market indices were also mixed over the
intermeeting period, share prices were extremely volatile. Equity market indices
jumped higher following the FOMC's interest rate cut, but subsequently
reversed much of these gains amid uncertainty surrounding the turmoil in
Argentina. On balance, EMBI+ spreads for Argentina and Brazil widened 65
and 18 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, but the overall
EMBI+ spread narrowed 19 basis points.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
It is becoming increasingly clear that spillover effects from the slowdown in the
U.S. economy are rippling through the foreign industrial countries, although the
magnitude of the impact varies widely. The Canadian external sector has been
particularly hard-hit, but so far domestic demand has remained quite resilient. In
contrast, in Japan slower growth of exports to both the United States and the
developing Asian economies has exacerbated the persistent weakness in the
household and construction sectors. Activity in the euro area, where indicators
are less current, also appears to be softening to rates below potential. Growth
has turned down in the United Kingdom as well, but one-time factors, including
the fallout from foot-and-mouth disease, have been the primary culprits.
Slower growth and declining energy prices have contributed to an easing in
headline inflation rates in Canada and the United Kingdom. In the euro area,
rising food prices have kept inflation about 1/2 percent above the ECB's target
ceiling of 2 percent. Japanese consumer prices continue to fall by about 1
percent per year.
The widespread deceleration in activity has been counteracted by significant
monetary policy easing by most foreign central banks. Since January, official
rates have been lowered 100 basis points to 5 percent in Canada, and by 50 basis
points to 5.5 percent in the United Kingdom. The Bank of Japan in March
effectively returned to the zero-interest-rate policy it abandoned when it raised
official rates by 25 basis points last August. The exception remains the
European Central Bank, which has maintained its repurchase rate at 4.75 percent
this year; the ECB's most recent change was a 25-basis-point increase last
October.
Recent indicators for Japan suggest that the economy is faltering. Declines in
both orders and shipments of machinery, as well as continued weakness in
nonresidential building contracts, indicate that investment spending is retreating
from the lofty levels reached late last year, as both corporate profits and business
confidence have eroded in the face of stagnant household demand and
weakening exports. Industrial production fell in the first quarter, its first
quarterly decline in nearly two years, and the all-industries index of output for
January and February on average was flat compared with its fourth-quarter level.
Housing starts were below their fourth-quarter level in the first quarter despite
some rebound in March. Indicators of consumer demand so far this year have
been somewhat more positive, as household expenditures in the first quarter
were about 1 percent above the fourth-quarter level. However, some of the
increase may have been due to a rush to make last-minute purchases of
household appliances before more stringent laws for the disposal and recycling

IV-13
of goods such as televisions and refrigerators were introduced on April 1. New
passenger car registrations were also up for the quarter on average, but all of the
increase was in January and registrations have fallen back since then.
The job market continues to soften. Employment in March was down about 1/2
percent from its recent peak in November of last year, reversing about half of the
gain that had occurred in the previous five months. The unemployment rate
remained at 4.7 percent in March, a bit below the recent postwar high, as both
employment and the labor force fell. The job-offers-to applicants ratio, a key
leading indicator, fell for the third consecutive month.

Prices continue to decline sharply. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo
area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 0.9 percent in
April from a year earlier. Deflation in wholesale prices for domestic goods has

IV-14
intensified as the impact of the earlier run-up in energy prices has faded, with
prices in March down about 1/2 percent from a year earlier. Land prices also
have continued to fall, with prices down 5 percent on average in January 2001
from a year earlier. This marked the tenth consecutive year of decline in prices
for both residential and commercial property.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) averaged $68 billion at
an annual rate in the first quarter of this year, about half the level in the same
period in 2000. The declining trend in the surplus reflects the impact of higher
oil prices as well as slowing global demand.
The Bank of Japan's March Tankan survey showed a sharp deterioration in
business sentiment. Sentiment declined across all major categories, although
larger drops were recorded in the manufacturing sector, where sentiment had
improved more last year, than in the nonmanufacturing sector. The survey
showed smaller expected gains this year than last in both sales and profits.
Investment is expected to fall nearly 9 percent in FY2001.
On March 19, the day before the last FOMC meeting, the Bank of Japan made
several monetary policy moves, including a change in the operating target for
money market operations from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the
outstanding balance of banks' deposits at the Bank of Japan; an explicit
commitment that this policy will be maintained until consumer price inflation is
registered at zero or more; and a stated intention on the part of the BOJ to
increase its outright purchases of long-term government bonds if it considers
that to be necessary for providing liquidity smoothly. The current target level of
bank balances is similar to the amount during the period when the zero-interest-
rate policy was in effect, so it is not yet clear whether the recent moves amount
to more than a return to that policy.
The government's release of more details of its "emergency economic package"
on April 6 was a disappointment to most analysts. The plan focuses on the
disposal of non-performing loans and on measures to reduce banks' exposure to
the equity market, partly by establishing a fund to purchase equity owned by
banks. The plan also includes tax reductions for dividends and capital gains as
well as measures to promote corporate restructuring, encourage urban
revitalization, increase liquidity in the land market, and introduce an
employment "safety net." On many points details are still sketchy. In particular,
the tax proposals will require legislation and there is some question about
whether they will actually be enacted.
In somewhat of an upset, former Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi
was chosen to replace the unpopular Prime Minister Mori on April 26. Mr.

IV-15
Koizumi ran on a platform of political renewal and structural reform, promising
in particular to speed up the write-off of non-performing bank loans, to reduce
government borrowing, and to privatize the postal savings system. Although
Mr. Koizumi's election suggests that the trend toward structural reform has
gained strength, it remains to be seen to what extent this will be translated into
actual policy, particularly in advance of the Upper House election in late July.
Indicators of activity in the euro area for the first quarter are limited and mixed,
but on balance suggest that growth has moderated from the pace recorded at the
end of last year. Industrial production displayed a typically volatile pattern in
January and February, but on balance was little changed from the fourth-quarter
average. In Germany, industrial production fell 3.7 percent in March to its
lowest level since last June, although it was still up 1 percent for the first quarter
as a whole. The euro-area purchasing managers survey moved down for the
twelfth consecutive month in April, dipping below the level that indicates a
contraction in manufacturing activity. Retail sales in the euro area were up a
moderate 0.5 percent in January/February from the fourth-quarter average, but
present a somewhat mixed picture across countries, with sales relatively weak in
Germany and Italy and strong in France. French consumption of manufactured
products also rebounded in the first quarter, growing 2.3 percent from the fourth-
quarter average.
More forward-looking indicators point to further moderation in the pace of
growth in the months ahead, as the rate of decline in euro-area industrial
confidence has intensified in recent months. Production expectations declined
considerably in France in April, and German manufacturing orders fell sharply
in the first quarter. Consumer confidence remains more upbeat, holding steady
in both March and April at a level well above its historical average.
The harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged down to 8.4 percent
in March. Based on national statistics, the French unemployment rate also
moved down further in March to 8.7 percent, its lowest rate in eighteen years. In
Germany, recent sluggish rates of economic growth appear to have slowed
employment gains. As a result, the German unemployment rate edged up to 9.3
percent in January and remained at that rate through April.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in March from the previous month,
primarily reflecting higher food prices. The twelve-month rate of consumer
price inflation in the euro area remained at 2.6 percent, above the European
Central Bank's 2 percent target ceiling for the tenth consecutive month. The
twelve-month rate of core inflation (which excludes energy and food prices)
remained at 1.8 percent in March. Preliminary data for Italy and Germany

IV-16
indicate that consumer prices rose more than expected in April, in part reflecting
further food and energy price increases.

Economic activity in the United Kingdom remained surprisingly weak in the
first quarter, with preliminary real GDP growth estimated to be only 1.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Output from extraction industries and manufacturing fell, while
growth in services related to tourism were only about half their fourth quarter
rates as visitors shied away because of foot-and-mouth disease. However,
retailing showed strong gains, as did some other areas of the service sector.

IV-17
Very limited indicators for the second quarter paint a mixed picture. Consumer
confidence, although ticking down slightly, remained at a relatively high level in
April. Business confidence, on the other hand, has fallen steadily over the first
four months of 2001, with the outlook for expected future production in the
manufacturing sector remaining quite pessimistic. Foot-and-mouth disease,
although abating, will most likely have noticeable effects on output in the
tourism and transportation sectors in the second quarter.

Notwithstanding the recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate remained at 3.3 percent in
March, the lowest rate in 25 years, while the labor force survey measure of the
unemployment rate declined to a record low of 5.2 percent for the three months
centered in January. Average annual earnings growth for February breached the
41/2 percent rate that the Bank of England believes to be compatible with its
inflation target, partly reflecting big bonuses in the financial sector. However,

IV-18
producer input prices have moderated in recent months, reflecting a fall in fuel
prices, and the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage
interest payments) continues to run below the 2-1/2 percent target.
At its April 5, 2001 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the
Bank of England voted to lower the official repo rate to 5.5 percent. This is the
second cut this year.
On March 7, 2001, Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced the government's
budget for the fiscal year 2001-2002. The budget is slightly expansionary,
providing for an additional £2.3 billion in public spending to be spread over the
next three years, mainly on education and health. It is seen by some as reflecting
the current government's desire to boost its popularity in advance of the coming
June 7th general election. Nevertheless, a budget surplus of about 2-1/2 percent of
GDP is forecast for fiscal year 2001-2002.
In Canada, indicators available for the first quarter suggest that growth has
slowed markedly from the pace observed during 2000. Real GDP at factor cost
on average in January and February was 0.4 percent above the fourth quarter
level, down from average quarterly growth of 0.9 percent in 2000. To date, the
slowdown has been concentrated in the export-dependent manufacturing sector,
with average industrial production in January and February about 1 percent
below the fourth-quarter level. The motor vehicle and electronic equipment
sectors, both of which are heavily dependent on U.S. demand, are the primary
areas of weakness.
Industries outside of manufacturing appear to be stronger. Despite further
declines in consumer confidence in the first quarter, nominal retail sales in
January and February were about 1 percent above the fourth quarter average,
suggesting consumption growth remains robust. Real GDP data for January and
February suggest the construction sector boomed in the first part of the year,
boosted by falling interest rates and a surge in construction following poor
weather in the fourth quarter. High levels of oil and gas exploration also
contributed heavily to growth in the first quarter. Total employment rose only
0.2 percent in the first quarter, but this followed a surge in employment in the
fourth quarter. The unemployment rate was 6.9 percent in the first quarter,
unchanged from the fourth quarter.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 2.5 percent in March,
well within the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target range. Higher
energy prices continue to account for much of the increase in consumer prices,
as the twelve-month core rate of inflation (which excludes food and energy
prices) was only 1.7 percent in March. The yield differential between nominal

IV-19
and real-return bonds has remained steady around 2 percent, suggesting inflation
expectations are stable.

The Bank of Canada has lowered its policy rate, the Bank Rate, a total of 100
basis points this year, most recently by 25 basis points on April 17. The Bank
Rate now stands at 5 percent, with the corresponding target for the overnight
rate, the rate most comparable to the U.S. Federal Funds Rate, being 4.75
percent. In its April 17 statement, the Bank singled out a pace of economic
expansion that was currently below trend as justification for the rate reduction.
In characterizing the economic slowdown in Canada, the Bank noted that "the
slowdown has largely been a consequence of the marked easing in the pace of
U.S. economic growth, while final domestic demand has maintained its
underlying momentum." The Bank's next policy announcement date is May 29.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Continued weakness in external demand has kept economic growth sluggish in
most of the major developing countries. One important exception is China,
where output was boosted by surprising strength in both domestic demand and
exports. In Korea, also, there have been some indications that the recent sharp
slowing in activity may be coming to an end. Inflationary pressures, on balance,
have remained contained in the developing regions, although inflation edged up
in Korea. Despite the weakness in exports, external balances did not deteriorate
markedly in most of the developing economies, as imports tended also to be
anemic.
Since the last Greenbook, the economic situation in Argentina has deteriorated
sharply, and Argentine financial markets have been in turmoil. Newly appointed
Economy Minister Cavallo has moved to try to stabilize a near-crisis situation
through several measures aimed at addressing Argentina's fiscal problems, lack
of international competitiveness, weak growth, and debt-servicing burden.
Nevertheless, the situation remains unstable.
Turkey is in the process of passing several laws as part of its economic reform
plan, and sent a letter of intent to the IMF on May 4. The Executive Board is
expected to meet Tuesday, May 15, to consider the program, which includes
$10 billion of additional money. After depreciating 40 percent, on balance,
since the currency was floated, the Turkish lira appears to have stabilized since
the beginning of April. Wholesale price inflation hit 51 percent (a.r.) in April,
reflecting substantial exchange rate pass-through.
In Argentina, data releases since the last Greenbook have given no signs of a
revival in economic activity. Industrial production declined in March for the
second consecutive month, and construction activity declined nearly 5 percent in
the first quarter (s.a.). The federal government's fiscal deficit for the first
quarter reached $3.1 billion, which was $1 billion higher than the government's
ceiling under its IMF program. April's tax revenues were lower than expected,
partly reflecting weak activity.
On March 21, Economy Minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy was forced to resign
after only 16 days on the job, as a result of his controversial proposed cuts in
public spending. He was replaced by Domingo Cavallo, the architect of
Argentina's currency board, who soon announced his "Competitiveness Plan" to
boost fiscal revenues in a politically more feasible way while improving the
country's international competitiveness. A tax on financial transactions was put
into effect, tariffs on consumer goods were raised, and tariffs on capital goods
were lowered. In late March, congress granted Cavallo limited emergency

IV-24
powers for one year, enabling him to issue decrees on many economic issues, but
prohibiting him from undermining the independence of the central bank and
from cutting certain types of public spending.

In early April, the central bank relaxed its reserve requirement on deposits from
20 to 18 percent, and allowed a limited portion of those reserves to be held in the
form of government bonds. This paved the way for a $2 billion issue of
government debt that was placed with banks on April 11. On April 16, Cavallo
submitted to congress a proposal that would peg the Argentine peso to an
average of the euro and the dollar, stipulating that the change would not occur
until the euro reached parity against the dollar. Escalating confrontation
between the government and the central bank over the government's desire for a
further relaxation in reserve requirements, combined with a congressional
inquiry into allegations that central bank president Pou had failed to investigate
money laundering, culminated in the dismissal of Pou on April 25. These
developments led to further disruptions in Argentine financial markets.
Roque Maccarone, a banker and associate of Cavallo, was appointed central
bank president.
Since April 26, market conditions have improved, on balance, as a result of the
news of further budget cuts and of a possible government debt exchange with
foreign banks to alleviate short-term funding pressure. On May 3, the Argentine
government released its Memorandum of Understanding on a revised IMF

IV-25
program. The program is scheduled to go before the Fund's Board within the
next few weeks. Also on May 3, the lower house of congress approved by a vote
136 to 16 Cavallo's proposal to add the euro to the peg; the bill will now be sent
to the senate for deliberation. On May 8 Argentine asset prices declined as a
result of the news that the government sold short-term treasury bills (Letes) at a
higher yield (12.4 percent) than many observers had expected, and that S&P
downgraded Argentine long-term and short-term debt.
In Mexico, economic activity has remained sluggish as a result of weaker
exports to the United States as well as a slowing of domestic demand. Industrial
production fell in both January and February (s.a.). Exports declined over
4-1/2 percent (s.a.) in the first quarter, but, reflecting weakness in domestic
demand, imports fell about 3-1/2 percent in the quarter. As a result, the trade
deficit widened only modestly. The stance of monetary policy remained
restrictive, and twelve-month inflation was flat in March, coming in at just over
7 percent.

In early April, the government presented a comprehensive reform package to
congress. The fiscal portion of the package seeks to reduce the government's
budget deficit by increasing tax revenues substantially. This is to be done
through broadening the tax base, eliminating exemptions, and introducing a

IV-26
15 percent VAT on food and medicines (categories which are currently not
subject to this tax). Financial measures contained in the package include the
creation of a new mortgage institution and a national savings bank, as well as
measures to make domestic financing more readily available to small and
medium-sized firms and reforms to more closely supervise the financial system
and increase transparency. The fiscal portion of the reform package has proved
to be quite controversial, and it is now expected to be debated and voted on in an
"extraordinary" session of congress sometime in June. The financial portion of
the package, however, was approved almost in its entirety in the regular session
of congress that ended in April.
In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have been mixed. Preliminary
data for March indicate a decline in industrial production (s.a.), but the
unemployment rate in the first quarter was about a percentage point lower than
in the fourth quarter of 2000. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, declined
between February and April. External deficits narrowed modestly in the first
quarter relative to the previous quarter.

Many of these developments, particularly the softening in consumer sentiment,
were heavily influenced by the spillovers from the turmoil afflicting neighboring
Argentina. In March and April, the central bank raised its benchmark interest
rate, the Selic, in two steps of 50 basis points each. The interest rate increases
were motivated by evidence of a rise in core inflation and a concern that the

IV-27
sizeable depreciation of the real in recent weeks would fuel inflationary
pressures. Political troubles have also weighed on the real; the threat of
congressional investigations into wrongdoing by some important members of the
political coalition supporting President Cardoso have reduced the prospects that
congress will enact reforms this year, including a measure that would grant the
central bank political independence.
In Venezuela, data released since the last Greenbook point to continued growth
and a further decline in inflation. Although the unemployment rate blipped up in
February to 14.2 percent (n.s.a.), it was down from the 16 percent level of a year
ago. Moreover, auto sales were up 39 percent in the first quarter from their
year-earlier level. Consumer prices rose 10.6 percent for the twelve months
ending in April, down over two percentage points from February's rate.
However, fiscal performance remains an area of concern, along with
vulnerability to a downturn in oil prices.

In Korea, recent indicators suggest that the sharp slowing in activity that became
evident near the end of last year and extended into the early months of this year
may be coming to an end. Industrial production rose slightly in March, the third
consecutive monthly increase after four straight months of decline. The
unemployment rate has stabilized in recent months after edging up in the last
half of last year. Indices of consumer and business confidence have turned up in
February and March, although their levels remain well below levels of a year
ago. Inflation has continued to edge higher in recent months, moving the

IV-28
twelve-month rate well above the Bank of Korea's target band of 2 percent to
4 percent. This uptick in inflation appears to be due mainly to the lagged impact
of higher oil prices, the weakness of the won, and an unusual seasonal surge in
food prices. Although the passing of temporary factors and relatively weak
economic growth are expected to bring the inflation rate back down later this
year, the elevated level of inflation has probably acted as a constraint on
monetary authorities, who have not changed interest rates since the reduction in
February.
Exports in March were 1 percent below their year-earlier level, the first
year-over-year decline in two years. The export slowdown over the past year has
been most noticeable for semiconductors (down 24 percent), computers (down
9 percent) and autos (down 6 percent). Imports registered an even steeper
9 percent overall drop in the twelve months to March, with raw material and
capital good imports (down 14 percent and 11 percent respectively) showing
particular weakness. With about half of imports used as inputs in export
production, the slowdown in intermediate goods imports is consistent with a
weak outlook for exports.

In the ASEAN region, recent data point to declining economic activity. Unusual
seasonal effects in January and February distorted the monthly pattern of
industrial production, but the overall trend was clearly down. Leading the
decline was Singapore, where production fell over 10 percent in the first quarter.
The slowdown in the region's production was largely driven by weaker external
demand. Although exports have fallen throughout the region, movements in the
trade balances have varied across the countries, as imports of components used
in production of export goods have also fallen. Inflation remained very low in
the region in the first quarter, with the notable exceptions of Indonesia and the
Philippines.
Serious political problems remain in parts of the region. In Indonesia, President
Wahid has been censured twice by parliament, and the next step in the process is
an impeachment trial. In addition, Indonesia and the IMF have not been able to
agree on a new letter of intent. Political problems in the Philippines re-emerged
recently when protests in Manila over the arrest of former president Estrada led
to concerns that rival politicians were trying to overthrow the Arroyo
administration.

In China, real GDP rose a faster-than-expected 12.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first
quarter, largely reflecting a strengthening of domestic demand. Private
consumption was boosted by recent increases in social welfare payments and
salaries of civil servants, while investment expanded due to increased
infrastructure spending and a pickup in inflows of foreign direct investment.
Despite stronger domestic demand, inflation remained well contained; consumer
prices increased only 0.8 percent in March compared with the same month a year
ago. The trade surplus widened sharply in March, as exports showed surprising
strength. China's exports appear to be holding up better than those of many
other emerging Asian economies, mainly due to a lower reliance on technology
products. President Bush is expected in the near future to extend China's normal
trade relations status for another year, despite increased political tensions
between the United States and China.

IV-31
In Hong Kong, recent indicators point to continued sluggishness. Exports were
roughly flat in the first quarter (s.a.), while imports declined about 3 percent.
Consumer sentiment weakened further as a result of recent falls in stock and
property prices. Rising concerns over job losses also weighed on consumer
confidence, with recent months having witnessed a reversal of last year's trend
of falling unemployment. The unemployment rate moved up to 4.6 percent (s.a.)
in the first quarter. The moribund property market has also put a drag on
investment, with property developers holding off on new construction spending.
The twelve-month rate of decline in consumer prices eased in the first quarter,
although prices continued to edge down on a seasonally adjusted basis.
In Taiwan, economic activity weakened further, largely in response to the global
slowdown. In the first quarter, industrial production declined 4 percent (s.a.),
dragged down by lower electronics and information technology production, and
exports fell nearly 10 percent (s.a.). In addition, imports plunged roughly
13 percent in the first quarter, partly reflecting a sharp decrease in demand for
imported capital equipment. Exports and imports remained weak in April.
Deteriorating economic conditions are also reflected in the labor market, where
the unemployment rate rose to 4 percent (s.a.) in March, close to a record high.
With domestic demand depressed, inflation remained very low. Since the March
Greenbook, Taiwan's central bank has cut interest rates by 25 basis points,
bringing the cumulative interest rate reduction since December 2000 to 75 basis
points. In an accompanying statement, the central bank cited the slowing global
economy, rising unemployment and "increasingly conservative" private spending
as reasons for the latest cut.
