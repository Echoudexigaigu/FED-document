Overview
Although real GDP appears likely to eke out a small gain in the second quarter,
the pace of activity across the various sectors continues to be highly uneven.
Generous incentives from automakers have helped to prevent a sharper drop-off
in vehicle sales, and overall real PCE appears to be headed for a small increase
this quarter. Construction activity remains solid in the residential
sector-supported by favorable mortgage rates-and increased investment in
mining and drilling and in utilities is providing a lift to spending on
nonresidential structures. In contrast, business spending on equipment and
software appears headed for another dismal quarter, and inventory imbalances
persist. As a result, firms in manufacturing and related industries have
continued to shed workers, and factory output will fall sharply again in the
second quarter. Energy prices may be cresting, and core inflation has slowed
after the hefty first-quarter increases.
Employment and Productivity
Labor demand has weakened further in recent months. In May, employment
declined for the second straight month, and the aggregate hours of production
workers were flat. Although the unemployment rate ticked down 0.1 percentage
point in May, we view this as only a pause in the general uptrend that began last
November.
Private nonfarm payroll employment declined 32,000 in May following a drop
of more than 200,000 in April.1 Last month's decline was again concentrated in
manufacturing and related industries, but employment in the service-producing
sector also increased well below trend, suggesting that the economic slowdown
has spread to sectors beyond manufacturing.
Within manufacturing, job losses were widespread in May, and the three-month
diffusion index of factory employment change fell to its lowest level since
March 1991. Since reaching its most recent peak in July 2000, the
manufacturing sector has shed 675,000 jobs, almost three-fourths of which have
been lost since the start of this year. Wholesale trade, an industry that is closely
linked to manufacturing, lost 13,000 jobs per month in April and May after
having posted little change in employment during the first quarter. Employment
1. As is its usual practice with the release of the May data, the BLS introduced its
comprehensive benchmark of the payroll survey to unemployment insurance records along with
revisions to establishment classification, bias adjustment factors, and seasonal adjustment
factors. In addition, the BLS introduced probability-based sample estimates and birth/death
estimates for the manufacturing, mining, and construction industries. The benchmark raised the
level of not seasonally adjusted total nonfarm payroll employment by 432,000 in March 2000,
with the April 2001 level revised up by a similar amount. Although the monthly pattern of
employment changes over the past year was altered somewhat, the new data still show a sharp
deceleration in employment beginning in the fourth quarter of last year.

in help supply services, which also is related to manufacturing activity, was flat
in May after having fallen an average of 50,000 per month in the first four
months of the year. Discussions with industry contacts suggest that employment
in this industry has not yet stabilized, and declines may be spreading beyond
workers with light industrial jobs to the clerical, office, and financial
occupations.
Excluding help supply, the services industry added 41,000 jobs in May-less
than half the average monthly gain in 2000-following an increase of only
14,000 in April. The weakness in services was concentrated in leisure-related
and business-related services industries, which are traditionally more cyclically
sensitive.
On the brighter side, hiring last month was brisk in finance, insurance, and real
estate, reflecting continued strength in housing-related businesses-mortgage
banking and real estate firms. Moreover, construction industry employment
jumped 31,000 in May, reversing nearly half its April decline. Buoyed by the
high level of activity in both residential and nonresidential building, job gains in
construction have held up well in recent months, averaging 18,000 per month
since the start of the year, identical to the average monthly increase over 2000 as
a whole.
Aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm
private payrolls were flat in May, as declines in employment were offset by an
increase in the average workweek. But this comes on the heels of a 0.3 percent
drop in April, and, thus, hours are very likely to post a decline for the second
quarter as a whole. In manufacturing, the weakness in May was accompanied
by another 0.2 hour drop in the factory workweek to 40.8 hours. The
manufacturing workweek is now a full hour lower than it was last July.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage
point in May to 4.4 percent. However, we suspect that an early survey week in
May contributed to a decline in unemployment of young workers, which held
down the overall unemployment rate slightly.2 Short-term job losers as a
percent of household employment (a rough proxy for the layoff rate) remained
at 1.1 percent in May, the highest level since 1996. Even with the small decline
in May, the unemployment rate stands 0.5 percentage point above the recent low
of 3.9 percent reached in September and October 2000.
2. The seasonal flow of college students into the labor market at this time of year is typically
large. Because of the early timing of the survey week, fewer students may have entered the
labor market by the time of the survey than is usual.

Other data also suggest that the labor market continued to soften in May. The
four-week moving average of initial unemployment insurance claims moved up
further to 425,000 in early June, a level not seen since 1992. Moreover, insured
unemployment reached nearly 3 million, its highest level in more than seven
years. Fewer employers surveyed by the Bureau of National Affairs reported
difficulty hiring workers in April and May, suggesting that labor demand eased
further; and while employers surveyed by the National Federation of
Independent Businesses have reported no change in hiring difficulties in the past
three months, the index remains well below the levels reached last fall.
Households' assessments of current labor market conditions, as measured in the
Conference Board survey, deteriorated somewhat further in May but remained
at relatively favorable levels, and expectations of employment conditions
improved slightly. Looking ahead, surveys conducted by Manpower and the
National Federation of Independent Businesses suggest that employers plan to
cut their hiring further in coming months.
The BLS now reports that productivity of all persons working in the nonfarm
business sector fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2001.3
However, this measure of productivity was depressed in the first quarter by a
surge in the volatile self-employed component of hours worked. The output per
hour of employees, who account for more than 90 percent of all hours, was
essentially flat in the first quarter. In the three quarters since the economic
slowdown began in 2000:Q3, the productivity of all persons has increased at an

annual rate of 1.3 percent, far below the average 5.5 percent rate over the
preceding three quarters. This sharp deceleration is roughly consistent with the
typical relationship between productivity and output, suggesting that the bulk of
the deceleration has been cyclical rather than structural.
The initial estimate of productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector for the
first quarter of 2001 showed that it edged down at an annual rate of
0.1 percent. Over the three quarters ended 2001:Q1, output per hour at
nonfinancial corporations rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, down from the
4.8 percent rate posted in the preceding three quarters.
Production and Inventories
Industrial production and manufacturers' inventories. The contraction of
the industrial sector has continued at a rapid pace. Total industrial production
fell 0.8 percent in May after a 0.6 percent decline in April. Manufacturing
production fell sharply again in both April and May, and lower electricity
generation led to a decrease in the output of utilities over this period as well.
Mining output also retreated in April and May after having posted strong gains
in the first quarter. Reflecting these widespread losses in production, the
diffusion index of three-month percent changes in IP declined to 33.3 percent
last month, only a shade above the previous low in the first quarter of 1991.
Manufacturing output fell 0.7 percent in May, but excluding motor vehicles and
parts, factory production was down 0.9 percent; indeed, the motor vehicle
industry was one of few sectors that picked up in May. Assemblies rose to an
annual rate of 11.8 million units, nearly a million units above the average
assembly pace in the first quarter. Elsewhere in manufacturing, large
production declines occurred at makers of consumer nondurable goods, business
equipment, and materials in May. With output declines widespread, the overall
factory operating rate sank to 76 percent-its lowest level since 1983.
The high-tech sector remains in the doldrums. The output of high-tech
industries decreased for a fifth consecutive month in May: Production of
semiconductors moved down 1.1 percent, and output of both office and
computer equipment and communications equipment dropped noticeably. At
70.3 percent in May, capacity utilization for high-tech manufacturing industries
has fallen 20 percentage points since its peak last summer. With the orders
situation for semiconductors and the downstream industries remaining weak,
further production cutbacks in high-tech seem likely. This interpretation is
consistent with a recent industry status report from the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA), which indicated that excess inventories of semiconductors
remain a concern despite having improved somewhat in the first quarter. More
recently, data from a monthly Dataquest survey of large semiconductor buyers
indicated that actual days' supply remained well above its target in May. On a

somewhat brighter note, the SIA report also indicated that the computer sector
has returned to "replenishment ordering."
Overall, the book value of manufacturing inventories increased at an annual rate
of $4.6 billion in April following the $11.9 billion liquidation posted in the first
quarter. Inventories at motor vehicle manufacturers (which mainly include
work in progress and materials and supplies) rose at a $6.4 billion annual rate.
Outside of motor vehicles, stocks were little changed in April. Nonetheless,
shipments were down sharply, and the inventory-to-shipments ratios in most
categories increased. Ratios appear to be especially high at producers of various
types of construction supplies, computers and electronic equipment, primary
metals, fabricated metals, chemicals, textiles, and apparel.
Partly reflecting the lingering inventory overhangs in many industries,
indicators of near-term activity for manufacturing point to further cuts in output.
The three-month moving average of real adjusted durable goods orders fell for a
ninth consecutive month in April, the latest month for which these data are
available. The new orders indexes in the NAPM survey and the Philadelphia
Survey of Business suggested that orders continued to decline in May, although
the levels of both indexes were notably higher than the troughs in January.

Aggregate inventories. Inventories held by firms outside of manufacturing
seem to be in somewhat better shape on balance. The book value of wholesale
inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of $6.4 billion in
April, and the overall inventory-sales ratio for this sector was unchanged.
Inventories held by distributors of computer equipment and electrical goods rose
noticeably in April, and with sales down in both categories, stock-to-sales ratios
climbed from already elevated levels. For other wholesalers, inventory-sales
ratios have moved up a little in recent months but remain well below the levels
of late 1998.
In the retail sector (excluding automotive dealers), the book value of
inventories dropped at an annual rate of $8 billion in April, compared with a
$4.3 billion increase in the first quarter. The liquidation was led by sizable
runoffs at clothing and accessory stores and at general merchandisers. Sales
moved up in these two categories in April, and inventory-sales ratios dropped
appreciably. Retailers in other categories registered only small inventory
changes in April, and in general, retailers' inventory-sales ratios have remained
relatively stable over the past year after having trended downward during the
latter half of the 1990s. All told, the book value of manufacturing and trade
inventories (excluding motor vehicles) increased at an annual rate of $3 billion
in April following the $10 billion (annual rate) liquidation recorded in the first
quarter.5
Motor vehicle sales and production. Sales of new light vehicles in May came
in at a hefty rate of 16.5 million units-unchanged from April and off just
500,000 units from the robust pace of the first quarter. Despite rising gasoline
prices, the Big Three automakers saw their sales of light trucks pick up from the
soft April pace, reflecting a strong consumer response to a late-month boost in
pricing and financing incentives at GM. Nevertheless, GM, Ford, and
DaimlerChrysler had a combined share of the light vehicle market of just
64 percent in May-only slightly above the record-low of 63 percent reported
last December.
On balance, the fundamentals affecting consumers' purchases of motor vehicles
look mixed in the near term. On the one hand, we expect that producers will
continue to offer attractive pricing schemes. Indeed, new vehicle prices as
measured in the CPI edged down further in May, and incentives on light trucks
by GM and Ford in June reportedly will be at least as high as those the month
5. The Census Bureau has begun reporting these inventory data according to the North
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). Although the definitions of many of the
sub-categories have changed, the aggregate inventory data are little affected by the changes in
definition.

before.6 On the other hand, a softening labor market and negative wealth effects
point to a further downshift in sales in coming months. In addition, the
increases in gasoline prices so far this year could produce a small drag on
overall motor vehicle demand, and car-buying attitudes in the University of
Michigan survey of consumer sentiment declined in early June.
The overhang of motor vehicle inventories that developed late last year was
largely worked off by the end of the first quarter. Currently, auto stocks
largely appear to be at comfortable levels. However, as a result of the
increases in light truck production in April and May, inventory imbalances
have re-emerged in that segment of the market. Days' supply of light trucks
was 74 in May-above the dealers' desired range of 65 to 70. Current
production schedules call for motor vehicle output to step up from an annual
rate of 11.5 million units in the second quarter to an 11.8 million unit rate in
2001:Q3. However, most industry analysts expect sales of domestically
produced vehicles to weaken further next quarter, and assemblies may well
come in below scheduled levels.7
6. With prices for new vehicles falling, prices for used cars and trucks have declined in
recent months as well.
7. Reducing output at this time of the year is not difficult because factory downtime for
summer vacations can be extended. In addition, start-up problems are not uncommon when new
models are introduced.

II-19
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
After having increased at an annual rate of about 2-3/4 percent in the previous
two quarters, the pace of consumer spending appears to have decelerated further
in the current quarter. Real purchases of consumer goods excluding motor
vehicles continued to increase in April and May, though at a slower pace than
earlier in the year. Moreover, real purchases of energy services will likely be
little changed in the second quarter after falling sharply in the first quarter.
Offsetting some of this weakness, outlays for non-energy services registered a
noticeable increase in April (the latest available data), led by gains in airline
travel, medical care, personal business services, and recreational services.
In May, nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which excludes
automotive dealers and building materials and supply stores, increased
0.4 percent following a slightly upward-revised gain in April of 0.8 percent.8
Sales were off sharply at general merchandise and clothing and accessory stores
in May. Nevertheless, many other retailers reported large increases in nominal
expenditures, including furniture outlets, health and personal care stores,
sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores, and food services (eating and
drinking establishments). Nominal outlays also rose at gasoline stations, but
this increase likely reflected higher prices at the pump last month. Physical
product data from the Energy Department indicate that real gasoline purchases
declined in May. Factoring in price changes, we estimate that retail control
increased 0.1 percent in real terms in May following an increase of 0.6 percent
in April.
Recently legislated tax reductions should provide some stimulus to consumption
later this year, although the timing and magnitude of the likely response is
uncertain. But other fundamentals for the household sector are rather soft. Real
disposable personal income has been rising only slowly this spring, and the
recent uptrend in the unemployment rate raises the possibility that households
could become cautious about purchasing more discretionary items. Although
the ratio of household net worth relative to disposable income will likely
increase in the second quarter, the sizable drag on spending from earlier declines
in wealth remains.
Overall, the Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) and Conference Board
surveys indicate that consumer sentiment has essentially moved sideways at
levels near their historical averages since January, after having dropped sharply
toward the end of 2000. Meanwhile, labor market expectations in both surveys
8. The Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey for May applied the NAICS to the
establishment-level data for the first time. Neither the changes in the industry classifications nor
the other data revisions associated with the Census Bureau's usual annual benchmarking
procedures led to any significant changes to the pattern of annual sales growth in the retail
control group between 1992 and 2000 or to its recent monthly movements.

have improved slightly, on balance, so far this year after having deteriorated
dramatically at the end of last year.
Housing Markets
Housing activity remained brisk in April and May. Low mortgage rates have
supported housing in recent months even as a weakening labor market and
sluggish personal income growth have acted to restrain it.
At an annual rate of 1.62 million units in May, total housing starts were little
changed from the pace in April.9 The April-May average was in line with
activity in the first quarter and was well above that seen last year. Single-family
housing starts were about unchanged in May at an annual rate of 1.29 million
units but were a bit above adjusted permits, suggesting that this starts figure
slightly overstates the underlying pace of activity. Multifamily starts edged
down almost imperceptibly in May.
Although the rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages has moved up since March
to just over 7 percent, rates are still quite low by historical standards. In
addition, ARM rates have been falling fairly steadily since late last year, and the
spread between one-year ARMs and thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages widened
from about 40 basis points in January to 132 basis points in mid-June.10
Sales of both new and existing single-family homes fell in April following near-
record levels for each in March.11 The April drop was more noticeable for new
home sales; sales of existing homes have remained within a fairly narrow band
since 1999. Looking ahead, more recent indicators of housing demand
continued to paint, on balance, a relatively upbeat picture. The Michigan
Survey's measure of households' perceptions of homebuying conditions jumped
again in early June, reflecting in part respondents' favorable views on mortgage
rates. And mortgage applications for home purchases continued to move higher
through mid-June.
9. The starts data were revised since January 1999 to incorporate changes in the way the
Census Bureau adjusts for late reports, undercoverage, and nonresponses. The revisions lowered
the level of single-family starts 2.5 percent and raised the level of multifamily starts 1.8 percent,
on average, over this period.
10. Although the ARM spread has widened sharply in recent months, the ARM share of
mortgage originations has declined from 14 percent in January to 10 percent in April. However,
because the ARM share is constructed from mortgages that closed in a given month, it tends to
lag the ARM spread, which is calculated from the mortgage rates recorded for that month.
11. The new home sales data were also revised to incorporate changes in the way the Census
Bureau adjusts for late reports, undercoverage, and nonresponses. These revisions affect the
historical data starting in January 1999: The level of new home sales was revised down
3 percent, on average, since then.

Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real expenditures on equipment and software
continued to fall early in the second quarter, a reflection of anemic growth in
output, declines in corporate cash flow, and continued uncertainty about the
pace of sales going forward.
The near-term outlook for spending on high-tech equipment continues to be
decidedly pessimistic. Nominal shipments of computing equipment dropped
3.9 percent in April (not at an annual rate) following a 9 percent decline in the
first quarter.12 In addition, anecdotal reports suggest that businesses are
lengthening the replacement cycle for personal computers and software, likely
in response to weak fundamentals.13 Shipments of communications equipment
slumped 9 percent in April after having fallen 13.6 percent in the first quarter.
Bookings also decreased sharply in April; since last June, orders have
plummeted 45 percent (not at an annual rate), and the level of new orders for
communications equipment in April was below shipments for the third
consecutive month, suggesting that shipments may have further to fall in coming
months.
Business expenditures for aircraft are likely to be little changed in the second
quarter. Although shipments of aircraft declined 9.2 percent in April, the
decrease appears to reflect, in part, a drop in exported planes. In addition, more
recent delivery data (provided by Boeing) point to a rebound in shipments in
May. Regarding business spending on motor vehicles, fleet sales dropped in
both April and May, and further declines are anticipated in June. The overall
slowing in business conditions likely is contributing to softer sales, but the
weakness in the second quarter mainly represents a payback from the
acceleration in automobile deliveries to fleet customers that occurred in the
first quarter. Although sales of medium and heavy trucks in May retraced most
of the sharp decline in April, sales so far this quarter are still running well below
their first-quarter pace, and new orders for medium and heavy trucks in May
remained extremely weak.
Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, nominal shipments of
nondefense capital goods fell 2.3 percent in April after having edged up
0.7 percent in the first quarter. The weakness in this category has been
12. With the release of the most recent orders and shipments data, the Census Bureau began
reporting these data according to the NAICS. The definitions of computers and nondefense
communications equipment were unchanged, but the definition of total nondefense capital goods
was altered to include data on photographic equipment; electromedical, measuring, and
controlling devices; and heavy-duty trucks. These category changes have no implications for the
BEA's construction of equipment and software investment.
13. Personal computers constitute about 67 percent of business spending on computers.

widespread, with only the turbines and power transmission equipment category
showing any strength. Excluding this grouping, orders fell 2 percent in April.
The level of new orders stayed well below the level of shipments in April, and
the backlog of unfilled orders fell sharply.
Nonresidential construction. Data through April showed that spending in the
nonresidential construction sector remained robust even as vacancy rates have
moved up a bit and rents are rising more slowly. Although the deterioration of
these fundamentals suggests that building construction may be becoming less
profitable, financing conditions have remained generally favorable. Seemingly,
investors have determined that, at least for now, the risks of lending for
commercial construction have not increased significantly.
Spending on nonresidential building construction ticked down slightly in April
after having advanced rapidly in the first quarter. The recent strength has been
evident in all the major sectors. In particular, outlays for industrial structures
remain high despite falling manufacturing employment and output-supported
in part by construction of private electric power plants and facilities for
cogeneration of power by industrial companies. Outside of building
construction, indicators for drilling and exploration expenditures (primarily for
natural gas) have remained strong.
The signs that the profitability of building construction is eroding have surfaced
in a number of market segments. In the office sector, the appreciation of
property values and rents moderated, and vacancy rates popped up in the first
quarter. Increases in retail-property rents have also slowed a bit in recent
quarters, and property values changed little over the past year. Year-over-year
growth in warehouse-property values was up sharply from last year's negative
readings, but this series has been unusually erratic recently, and rent gains for
warehouses have continued to drop back. In the industrial sector, the vacancy
rate moved up in the first quarter, suggesting that the sharp declines in capacity
utilization associated with the slowdown in manufacturing activity have begun
to affect this sector.
For the most part, financial markets have taken the recent deterioration of these
indicators in stride. The available monthly data suggest that issuance of
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) will likely increase in the
second quarter from an already robust first-quarter pace. Although rates paid by
borrowers on CMBS have moved up a bit in recent months, spreads relative to
the ten-year swap rate have been about flat, suggesting that investors' views of
the risk of lending for commercial construction have not deteriorated. That said,
the delinquency rate on CMBS has moved up a bit, on balance, in recent
months, although the most recent reading for April was still at a low level.

Government Sector
Federal. According to Treasury data, the federal government ran a surplus of
$137 billion over the first eight months of fiscal year 2001 (FY2001)-
$16 billion more than during the same period of FY2000. Although receipts
have continued to increase more rapidly than outlays so far this fiscal year, they
have, nevertheless, decelerated sharply for the fiscal year-to-date, reflecting the
slowdown in economic activity; receipts are up 4-1/2 percent relative to the first
eight months of FY2000 compared with a 12 percent advance in the preceding
year. The gains in receipts from individual taxes have continued to be robust,
owing primarily to a surge in non-withheld receipts collected during the April-
May filing season. However, net corporate receipts during April and May
dropped significantly from the same period last year, reflecting continued
weakness in corporate profits. (Daily Treasury data indicate that corporate
payments for the first half of June were again noticeably below last year.)

tax, pension and IRA provisions, and temporary relief from the alternative

The tax rate reductions will lead to substantially lower revenues in fiscal years
2001 and 2002. Tax rates above the 15 percent bracket are reduced by
1/2 percentage point in 2001 and an additional 1/2 percentage point in 2002. In
addition, beginning in 2002, the bottom of the 15 percent bracket is replaced by
a new 10 percent bracket, applicable to the first $12,000 of taxable income for
joint filers. In 2001, a rebate on 2000 income taxes will be paid in lieu of the
new 10 percent bracket; these rebates are estimated to total $38 billion and will
be paid in the third quarter.15
In order to provide a cushion for additional spending contemplated in the fiscal
year 2002 budget resolution, the tax law also shifts $33 billion in corporate
payments from fiscal year 2001 into fiscal year 2002.16 Including this timing
change, the tax cut is expected to reduce revenues by $74 billion in fiscal year
2001 and $38 billion in fiscal year 2002.
State and local governments. Data in hand point to continued solid growth in
real spending by state and local governments. Real construction spending
jumped another 1 percent in April, the sixth consecutive monthly increase. In
addition, employment was up on average 25,000 per month in April and May.
While this is below the rapid advance in the first quarter, hiring remains quite
strong by historical standards.
Legislatures in forty-seven states have been working on their annual or biennial
general fund budgets this spring, and most will likely have them finalized by the
end of their fiscal years.17 Growth in state tax collections, measured by the
Rockefeller Institute relative to the same quarter a year earlier, averaged
4.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001.18 These
rates are the lowest for two consecutive quarters since 1992. Partly as a result, a
number of states have had to wrestle with downward revisions to their revenue
forecasts. For some states, such as Oregon, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and
Maryland, weaker projected revenues have meant a smaller expected surplus for
14. The tax law is examined in detail in a memo to the FOMC by Glenn Follette dated
June 1, 2001.
15. The rebate will be calculated based on the tax savings that the 10 percent bracket would
have provided had it been in place during 2000; thus, single filers will receive up to $300, heads
of household up to $500, and joint filers up to $600.
16. The $33 billion figure is a JCT estimate. Given the weakness in corporate receipts,
however, we estimate that the figure will turn out to be closer to $28 billion.
17. All but four states end their fiscal year on June 30. Twenty-one are on a two-year
budget cycle, with most writing their budgets in odd-numbered years.
18. The NIPAs do not show separate data on tax receipts between collections from states
and collections from local governments.

next year; however, to avoid projecting deficits, other states have had to use a
variety of strategies including funds transfers, reductions in planned spending,
and some increases in fees.
Prices and Labor Costs
Core consumer price inflation seems to have cooled somewhat in recent months
after coming in on the high side earlier in the year. The core CPI edged up
0.1 percentage point in May and is up 2.5 percent over the past twelve months,
an acceleration of only 0.1 percentage point from the preceding year. The
overall consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in May, boosted by a further
surge in energy prices, and has risen 3.6 percent over the past twelve months.
However, energy prices may now have peaked.
After moderating a bit toward the end of the first quarter, retail energy prices
rose substantially in April and May, with the largest increases among motor
fuels. In the first half of April, inventories of gasoline were about 5 percent
below the normal range for the season, and several domestic refineries were
not operating because of either maintenance or breakdowns. However, since
then, stocks have been replenished by resumed refinery production and a surge
in imports. Stocks of the gasoline additive MTBE have been rebuilt as well,
easing concerns that supply might not be sufficient for refiners to produce
enough summer-blend reformulated gasoline.19 With inventories having
recovered impressively, both wholesale and retail gasoline prices have
retreated in recent weeks. Futures quotes point to further declines in spot
gasoline prices in coming months, as the risk of supply disruptions during the
driving season diminishes.
A similar, rapid replenishment of inventories has helped pull down natural gas
prices. On April 1, inventories of natural gas were 35 percent below normal,
but since then, gas has been injected into storage caverns at the fastest rate seen
in the twenty-five years that the Department of Energy has kept records. By
late May, the American Gas Association and the Department of Energy
estimated that inventories had recovered to the normal level for the season.
Weather has been somewhat milder than usual over the past two months, but the
bulk of the increase in inventories results from the production and consumption
response to higher gas prices over the past year. Industrial gas usage is down
about 3 percent from last year, and electricity producers have cut consumption
of gas by about the same percentage. At the same time, the higher natural gas
prices have encouraged more exploration, and gas output so far this year is
running about 2 percent above year-earlier levels. The sharp rebuilding of gas
19. Near the start of the summer, however, stocks of another additive-ethanol-appeared
quite low, pointing to risks for Midwestern areas that use ethanol to produce their reformulated
gasoline.

inventories has led to a drop in spot and near-futures prices of natural gas since
April.20 At this point, markets are showing little concern about a shortfall this
coming winter.
Electricity markets remain fairly calm outside of California, and nationwide
generating capacity has risen 4-1/2 percent over the past twelve months.
However, California still faces the prospect of blackouts and wholesale price
increases on the hottest days of this summer. Nonetheless, upward pressures on
electricity prices there have eased markedly in the past month or so. Since
April, California's seasonally adjusted retail demand for electricity has fallen in
response to higher prices, and natural gas input costs to electricity generators
have also eased. As a result, the disparity between retail prices and input costs
has narrowed substantially, reducing (but by no means eliminating) the prospect
of further residential rate increases.
Consumer food prices rose 0.3 percent in May and have increased 3.1 percent
over the past twelve months, an acceleration of about 1 percentage point from
the previous year. The erratic index for fruits and vegetables declined last
month, and the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, which had increased
more than 0.7 percent on average each month in 2001, rose just 0.1 percent in
May. But prices for other foods were up 0.5 percent, largely reflecting
increases for dairy products and fats and oils.
The small increase in the CPI excluding food and energy items in May left the
three-month change for these items at 2.2 percent at an annual rate, well below
the spike that occurred early this year. The CPI for core commodities fell
0.4 percent in May, with motor vehicle prices edging down further and with
price declines for apparel and other goods likely reflecting weak demand. Over
the past twelve months, core goods prices have risen 0.1 percent-a
deceleration of about 1/2 percentage point from the previous twelve-month
period. In contrast, prices for non-energy services have accelerated notably
over the past year, and the index for these items rose another 0.3 percent in
May. Over the twelve months ended in May, prices for non-energy services
have increased 3.6 percent, about 1/2 percentage point more than in the
previous twelve-month period. Prices for shelter rents rose 0.4 percent in May,
and these prices have increased 3.7 percent over the past twelve months, a
pickup of 0.6 percentage point relative to the preceding year. Prices for medical
services have accelerated a similar amount over the past year.
As with the CPI, core PCE prices picked up in the first quarter but posted a
more moderate reading in April. The information in the May CPI points to a
20. California spot prices of natural gas remain quite high relative to the rest of the country,
but even these prices have come down sharply in recent weeks.

flat May reading for core PCE prices and suggests that the twelve-month
change will remain around 1-3/4 percent.
Prices for capital goods as measured by the producer price index edged down in
May, leaving the twelve-month change at 0.8 percent, about the same as a year
ago. Prices for computers plummeted in the first quarter as demand dried up in
the high-tech sector, but prices look to have firmed a little in the last couple of
months. In all, computer prices have declined 17.2 percent over the twelve
months to May, about the same as the decline over the previous year.
At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate
materials rose 0.6 percent in the twelve months ended in May, a marked
slowdown from the 3.2 percent jump over the previous twelve months. And the
PPI for core crude materials edged down further in May after having dropped
sharply earlier in the year. Indexes of industrial materials prices (such as the
Commodity Research Bureau and Journal of Commerce commodity price
indexes) also generally have moved down since the last Greenbook. One
exception is the price of lumber, which has risen substantially, on net, since the
start of April. Lumber distributors reportedly had run off their stocks earlier in
the year in anticipation of a possible softening in housing demand and
apparently had to do some quick restocking during the spring as housing starts
held firm. Prices also have been influenced by renewed sparring between
Canada and the United States regarding imports of softwood lumber into this
country.21
Inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have been little changed on
balance. The median expectation for inflation over the coming year moved
back down to 3 percent in June after having ticked up earlier in the quarter; the
latest reading is near the middle of the range seen over the past couple of years
for this expectation. Over a five- to ten-year horizon, median expected inflation
also was 3 percent and has remained little changed over the past year and a half.
We have received few new data regarding labor costs. Average hourly earnings
of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose
0.3 percent in May following a similar increase in April. Over the twelve
months ended in May, average hourly earnings rose 4.3 percent, 0.5 percentage
point faster than over the previous twelve months. Compensation per hour in
the nonfarm business sector, a broader measure of compensation than average
21. A five-year agreement that had limited lumber imports from Canada expired on March
31, but an investigation that is in progress at the International Trade Commission could lead to
new restrictions. Meanwhile, Canadian producers are said to be holding down exports
voluntarily, partly to avoid provoking an unfavorable ITC ruling later this year.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Although investors had largely anticipated the 1/2 point easing at the May
meeting of the FOMC, some had not ruled out the possibility of a smaller move,
and many were wondering whether the Committee would signal that the current
easing cycle was drawing to a close. Instead, the Committee's references to
restrained inflation pressure and capital spending weakness reinforced investors'
perception that they could expect more policy easing in the months ahead.
Since that time, weaker-than-expected economic data have strengthened this
perception. Current readings from futures markets suggest that investors have
fully priced in a 25 basis point easing, and place better-than-even odds on a 50
basis point easing, at next week's meeting. Looking farther out, investors
appear to expect the federal funds rate to fall to 3.5 percent or below later this
year.
Nominal Treasury coupon yields fell 16 to 30 basis points over the intermeeting
period, while real yields (as measured by Treasury indexed debt) were about
unchanged, implying that inflation compensation reversed some of its recent
rise. Longer-term investment-grade private yields fell about in line with
Treasuries. In contrast, worries about near-term earnings, coupled with
mounting debt downgrades and defaults, have pushed junk bond yields up more
than 80 basis points in recent weeks.
Over the intermeeting period, analysts again revised down their expectations for
second-quarter corporate earnings growth. They also trimmed their forecasts for
third-quarter earnings growth; nonetheless, their predictions continue to imply a
sharp acceleration in corporate profits from the second to third quarters.
Although the equity market held up well through most of the intermeeting
period, recent earnings warnings have pushed prices down, hitting technology
stocks particularly hard. On balance, equity prices have fallen between 2-1/2
percent and 4 percent since the last FOMC meeting.
Corporations took advantage of falling interest rates by issuing a record volume
of bonds in May and early June and used some of the proceeds to pay off bank
loans and commercial paper obligations. Ratings downgrades and business
failures continued to mount in May and June, although private-sector forecasters
do not expect bond defaults to rise further from their current elevated levels.
Although consumer interest rates fell and debt growth likely slowed from the
first to the second quarter, it appears that the household debt-service burden will
rise again, exceeding its previous high reached in the mid-1980s. Households
continued to file for bankruptcy in near-record numbers, and credit card
delinquency rates continued to rise, although other measures of household credit
quality have not shown an appreciable deterioration.

Business Finance
Stock analysts currently expect S&P 500 operating earnings per share to decline
about 17 percent in the second quarter compared with results for a year earlier,
the steepest falloff in more than a decade. Looking further out, analysts have
also knocked down their forecast for year-ahead earnings, although less
dramatically. On balance, with stock prices also down a bit, equity valuations,
as measured by the ratio of price to year-ahead expected earnings, are roughly
unchanged over the intermeeting period.
Nonfinancial corporations issued over $67 billion in bonds in May, more than in
any other month; firms in the telecom and energy sectors accounted for the bulk
of issuance. Nearly a third of May's issuance was speculative grade, indicating
that investors, though highly selective, continued to accept junk issues.
Preliminary issuance numbers from the first week of June also show continued
strength. Corporations have indicated that they plan to use the proceeds from
recent issuance for capital expenditures and to replace other funding sources,
including bank loans and commercial paper. Indeed, business loans at banks
contracted again in May, as did commercial paper. Quality spreads for
commercial paper continued their slow return to long-run average levels as
lower-quality issuers left the market.
Results from the May Survey of Terms of Business Lending show that banks
have firmed the pricing of loans, the overall average spread of domestic C&I
loan rates over the federal funds rate target increased 11 basis points, reaching
2.11 percent. Spreads on the riskiest loans not made under commitment
climbed, while those on the safest loans declined.
Equity issuance rebounded slightly in May, rising from its low April level on the
strength of seasoned issues and issuance by energy firms. The IPO market has
revived a bit, bolstered in June by a large issue to fund the spin off of Kraft.
Technology firms, however, continue to issue relatively little equity.
Equity retirements have remained low. With profits weak and cash balances
sagging, few corporations announced new share repurchase programs.
Furthermore, few companies completed acquisitions or merged with other
companies in April and May.
Available measures indicate some deterioration in corporate credit quality. Call
Reports for the first quarter show a further rise in delinquencies on C&I loans at
banks. More recently, Moody's downgraded, on net, about $30 billion of
nonfinancial bonds in May, adding to the large downgrades earlier this year.
Another $50 billion of bonds, on net, are on Moody's watch list and could be
downgraded. The default rate on junk bonds edged up in May to nearly
11 percent, mainly because of defaults by a few large tech companies. KMV
Corporation's index of year-ahead expected defaults ticked down in May, owing

to that month's increase in stock prices and decrease in volatility, but the index
remains high. Equity market developments and widening junk risk spreads in
June suggest that the index may reverse some of its recent decline.
The commercial real estate sector continues to show modest deterioration but is
far from the doldrums of the early 1990s. Indeed, investors' hearty appetite for
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) continues, and spreads have
changed little despite heavy issuance and rising (although still low)
delinquencies. In the first quarter, vacancy rates ticked up from their low levels.
Total commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have decelerated in the second
quarter to an 8 percent rate.
Household Finance
The ratio of household assets to disposable income in the second quarter is
expected to remain about unchanged from the first quarter. Households have, in
the past couple of months, appeared to reverse somewhat their earlier, more
pessimistic, outlook for equity returns; they stepped up their purchases of equity
and high-yield mutual fund shares and continued to allocate relatively high
proportions of their contributions to 401(k) plans to equities.
Growth in both consumer and home mortgage debt is estimated to have slowed
somewhat in the second quarter, in line with decelerating consumer
expenditures and less robust housing activity. Interest rates on home equity
lines of credit and new car loans at commercial banks fell 38 and 16 basis points
respectively since the last FOMC. Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages fell less
sharply, while rates on fixed-rate mortgages remained about unchanged.
Despite drops in some interest rates, households' debt-service burden in the
second quarter is projected to have risen to its twenty-year high of near
14-1/2 percent of disposable personal income, as income growth slowed more
than debt growth.
A high debt-service burden has contributed to a decline in household credit
quality. Bank Call Report data show that delinquencies on credit cards rose,
while delinquencies on other consumer loans (mainly autos) fell in the first
quarter. More recent data for April show this pattern continuing, with
delinquencies on credit cards in securitized pools rising to a two-year high, and
auto-loan delinquencies remaining low. The weekly rate of personal bankruptcy
filings has declined from its recent record levels, as the rush to file ahead of
pending legislative reform has ebbed somewhat. Despite this recent decline,
household bankruptcy filings remain well above their year-earlier levels.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury continued to pay down sizable amounts of marketable debt over
the intermeeting period. To meet short-term funding needs through the June 15

corporate tax date, the Treasury issued a large volume of cash management bills.
This reliance on cash management bills will presumably drop off later this year
after the Treasury introduces its four-week bill. The Treasury is expected to
make heavy use of this new funding vehicle when it pays out tax-rebate checks
later this summer and into the fall.
Treasury market liquidity conditions were little changed over the intermeeting
period. Judging by primary dealer transactions, trading activity remained robust
and on-the-run liquidity premiums held fairly constant at about 12 to 15 basis
points-considerably below the elevated levels of 1998 and 1999. Bid-ask
spreads for most securities edged down over the period, but remained at rather
high levels.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have continued to issue benchmark debt at a rapid
pace-more than $20 billion in late May and early June. Issuance of bellwether
agency bills has also remained robust. During this period, the GSEs' stock
prices appreciated rapidly, as markets interpreted the recent political changes in
the Senate as signaling that the GSEs would face less political risk over the
coming year.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds rebounded in May from its low
level in April as several governments took advantage of lower rates to issue new
debt. With the exception of California, credit quality in the municipal sector
remained strong. Standard and Poor's cut California's debt rating two notches,
from AA to A+, and kept the state's debt on its watch list; in sum, $25 billion of
outstanding bonds were affected. Early in June, California sold a $1 billion
general obligation bond, using the proceeds to finance a variety of construction
projects not related to the energy crisis. The bond was well received, with a
lower-than-expected spread. As part of its plan to finance expenditures related
to its power crisis, California intends to bring a $14 billion bond issue to market
in August and September.
Money and Bank Credit
After expanding briskly in the first quarter, M2 growth has slowed recently. M2
grew about 7-3/4 percent on average in April and May, though the individual
months were affected by tax payments. Households apparently reversed some
previous transactions and moved cash out of retail money market mutual funds
and into long-term mutual funds, particularly equity funds. M3, in contrast,
expanded at a rapid 13-1/4 percent annual rate in May, driven by institution-
only money funds.
Bank credit decelerated, increasing less than 2 percent in May. Corporations
likely used some of the proceeds from their recent heavy bond issuance to pay
down shorter-term debt, including bank loans. Indeed, business loans fell more

The value of exports of goods and services declined moderately in March to
about the same level recorded in January, with much of the decrease in capital
goods. In the first quarter, the value of exports declined 3 percent at an annual
rate, the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. The largest declines
were in automotive products (primarily cross-border trade with Canada),
machinery (both high tech and other), and industrial supplies. By region, the
recent declines in goods exports were largely to Asia and Latin America. In
contrast, goods exports to Western Europe increased.
The value of imports of goods and services rebounded in March from the sharp
drop in February, to a level that was nonetheless lower than recorded in any of
the eight months preceding February. The jump in March was largely in
imported consumer goods. Consumer goods were also the largest single source
of import decline in February. In the first quarter, the value of imports fell
10 percent at an annual rate. Imports had leveled off in the fourth quarter of last
year following several quarters of strong growth. The largest declines in the first
quarter were in high-tech machinery (computers, semiconductors, and
telecommunications equipment), automotive products (primarily from Canada),
and oil (entirely from a drop in price). In contrast, there were moderately strong
increases in imports of consumer goods and non-oil industrial supplies.

Trade data for April, and revised figures for all prior months, will be released on
Thursday, June 21, as part of the annual revisions of the U.S. international
transactions accounts. These data will be reported in the Greenbook
supplement.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil moved up in May following declines in most
other months of the year, partly the result of a new round of OPEC supply cuts.
Thus, prices of imported oil decreased only moderately in April-May, on
average, compared with a much larger drop in the first quarter. The spot price of
West Texas intermediate crude remained between $27 and $30 per barrel in May
and early June. On June 4, Iraq suspended oil exports through the U.N. oil-for-
food program to protest the revisions to the sanctions framework that are
currently being debated by the U.N. Security Council. OPEC officials have
pledged to counteract any significant supply disruption from Iraq, but not before
the cartel meets again in early July to re-evaluate the Iraqi situation. Crude oil
price movements may also have been damped by increased levels of crude oil
inventories, particularly in the United States.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods (and core goods) declined
0.2 percent in May with all major categories either declining or unchanged. May
was the second month of moderate price declines. The largest price decreases in
May were in food (mostly vegetable prices) and industrial supplies (primarily
falling prices for unfinished metals and chemicals). For April-May combined,
prices of imported core goods dropped 5.1 percent at an annual rate from the
first quarter, largely, but not entirely, because of declines in the price of natural
gas from elevated levels. Excluding natural gas, there were small to moderate
price declines in all major trade categories.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports (total and core) decreased 0.3 percent in
May, the fourth consecutive month of flat or declining prices. The largest
declines in prices of core goods in May were in industrial supplies. For
April-May combined, prices of exported core goods declined 1.2 percent at an
annual rate. Rising prices of exported capital goods (excluding computers and
semiconductors) and automotive products were more than offset by declining
prices of consumer goods, agricultural products, and industrial supplies.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official reserves held in the United States fell by almost $10 billion in
April (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).
Moderate decreases were reported for France and several Asian countries.
Argentina, whose reserves in the United States fell almost $6 billion in March,
showed a $2 billion increase for April. In April, the composition of official
reserves shifted markedly away from U.S. Treasury securities and toward agency

IV-6
debt and bank liabilities. Official foreigners sold $20 billion in Treasuries, about
half of which was in bills. Because total Treasuries outstanding also fell in
April, the percentage of the total in foreign official portfolios remained roughly
constant. It should be recalled that the large increase in official reserves held in
the United States registered in the first quarter of 2001 was entirely the result of
China's decision to shift dollar reserves from Europe to the United States.
Preliminary reports for official holdings at FRBNY indicate a further slight fall
in May.
Private foreigners also reduced their holdings of Treasuries in April (line 4a),
bringing the net decline for the first four months of 2001 to $14 billion; at the
end of April, private foreigners held about 22 percent of outstanding Treasuries,
little changed from the end of December. Foreign private net purchases of U.S.
agency bonds, corporate and municipal bonds, and equities, while somewhat
below the record pace of the first quarter and March, were still quite strong in
April (lines 4b, 4c, and 4d). Large purchases of corporate bonds were registered
in the United Kingdom and the Caribbean, while agency purchases were
concentrated in China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. U.S. equities were
purchased primarily in Europe and Japan.
For the fifth straight month, U.S. residents made significant net purchases of
foreign equities (line 5b); these were concentrated in Canada and Japan. By
contrast, there were widely distributed net sales of foreign bonds (line 5a).
Although the acquisition of foreign equities via stock swaps (line 5c) was again
zero for April, already completed takeovers indicate that such swaps will be at
least $22 billion in May-largely the result of the takeover of VoiceStream by
Deutsche Telekom-and $9 billion in June.
In the U.S. banking sector, net inflows of $34 billion were recorded in April
(line 3). These inflows were in sharp contrast to the exceptionally large
outflows in March of $100 billion. The partial reversal in April was due in large
part to a significant increase in U.S. custodial holdings of domestic money
market instruments for foreign customers.
Balance of payments data for 2001:Q1, including direct investment capital
flows, will be released on June 21, and will be discussed in the Greenbook
supplement.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the major currencies index of the exchange value of the dollar rose
percent over the intermeeting period, as the dollar's appreciation against the
euro, the Swiss franc and sterling was offset only partially by its depreciation
versus the Canadian dollar. Despite indications that the slowdown in U.S.
economic growth may last longer than had been anticipated in the spring, market
participants generally appeared willing to maintain their holdings of dollar-
denominated assets, as data from the euro area and Japan also showed significant
slowing. The index of the dollar's value against the currencies of our other
important trading rose 1/2 percent.

The dollar appreciated 2% percent on balance against the euro during the
intermeeting period. The dollar reached its highest level against the common
currency since November 2000, before retracing a bit late in the period as
several euro-area officials openly discussed the possibility of foreign exchange
intervention. Despite data indicating a slowdown in France and Germany, the
European Central Bank was thought to be constrained from aggressive monetary
easing by rising inflationary pressures. On net, three-month interest rates
declined 12 basis points in the euro area during the period, a smaller decline than
in the United States.

The dollar appreciated 1-3/4 percent on balance against sterling, briefly exceeding
a 15-year high set last year before retracing a bit late in the period. Much of the
exchange rate move came around the time of the Labour Party's victory in the
general elections. Labour's victory was seen as increasing the odds of Britain's
entry in the euro area, and many market analysts argued that the British
government would want the pound to depreciate substantially versus the euro
before entry into the European Monetary Union. With the British economy
showing some signs of resilience, and inflation rising to a level close to its
target, the Bank of England's.Monetary Policy Committee chose not to ease
policy.
The Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark rate to 4.75 percent at the end of
May. The dollar depreciated 1-1/4 percent versus the Canadian dollar in an
apparent unwinding of moves that occurred earlier this year, as data indicated
that the Canadian economy was not slowing as much as had been expected.
The strength of the Japanese yen, which was little changed against the dollar and
appreciated 2.5 percent against the euro during the intermeeting period, was
puzzling, as data showed that the Japanese economy contracted during the first
quarter and remained very weak in the second quarter Several market
participants attributed the yen's strength to unconfirmed reports that some large

IV-10
Japanese institutional investors were closing out losing foreign investment
positions, particularly in the euro area. Despite overt political pressure, the Bank
of Japan did not undertake further monetary easing, and called instead for
structural reforms by the government. While equity prices in most industrial
economies declined during the period, Japanese share prices, led by the banking
sector, fell the most, as the market optimism that followed Prime Minister
Koizumi's election began to fade.

In emerging markets, the focus during the intermeeting period was squarely on
Latin America. Argentina's program to exchange current government debt for
new bonds with a lower servicing burden in the next few years was completed
on June 4. The exchange, which resulted in a larger bond swap than had been
anticipated, was generally viewed as a success. Many analysts, however, warned

IV-11
that Argentina may have traded short-term relief for insurmountable difficulties
in the medium and long term. Late in the period, Argentina introduced a
de facto dual exchange rate system, with a separate exchange rate based on an
equal basket of dollars and euros to be used solely for international trade. The
announcement raised fears of an upcoming peso devaluation among international
investors. Nevertheless, on net over the period, short-term interest rates fell in
Argentina, as did the spread over Treasuries of Argentine sovereign debt. In
Brazil, beset by a severe energy crisis and concern over Argentina, the real
depreciated more than 7 percent against the dollar to an all-time low, despite
intervention operations, sales of dollar-indexed debt, and an increase in the main
central bank policy rate. The Mexican peso, in contrast, appreciated 1 percent
on net versus the dollar, with much of the movement following the
announcement of the purchase of a major Mexican bank by a U.S. money center
bank. The same news contributed to a large increase in Mexican share prices.
The Desk did not intervene during the period for the
accounts of the System or Treasury.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
First-quarter real GDP data confirm that activity in the foreign industrial
countries has slowed along with the deceleration in U.S. economic activity,
although to varying degrees. Recent data indicate that the slowdown has
persisted in the current quarter, with industrial output especially weak. In Japan,
real GDP declined in the first quarter, with exports down sharply and domestic
demand supported only by a sizable increase in public investment. Current-
quarter indicators suggest activity may contract further. Real GDP expanded at
a moderate pace in the euro area, but exports fell, and domestic demand
weakened notably. More recent indicators show further deterioration
particularly in manufacturing sentiment. Industrial output contracted in the
United Kingdom, while service sector activity has continued at a healthy pace.
In Canada, manufacturing output has been especially hard hit by the U.S.
slowdown, but domestic demand has been supported by consumption
expenditures and residential investment.
Higher food and energy prices have boosted rates of headline consumer price
inflation in Europe and Canada; in the euro area, headline inflation is now
almost one and a half percentage points above the ECB's 2 percent target
ceiling. Measures of core inflation have also moved up somewhat both in the
euro area and Canada. In Japan, consumer prices continue to fall by about 1
percent per year.
Faced with slowing growth but some evidence of a pickup in inflation, central
banks in Europe and Canada eased monetary policy in May but have left policy
rates unchanged so far in June. Since January, policy rates have been lowered
125 basis points in Canada, 75 basis points in the United Kingdom, and 25 basis
points in the euro area.
Recent indicators for Japan suggest that the economy may be heading into
another recession. Real GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.8 percent in the first
quarter of 2001 despite a sharp increase in government investment, and
indicators for the second quarter suggest the possibility of a further decline. The
first-quarter weakness was widespread among components of private demand.
Nonresidential investment fell about 4 percent at an annual rate from the high
level reached late last year, and residential investment dropped at a rate of nearly
20 percent as the impact of temporary tax incentives has begun to fade.
Consumption spending was flat despite a boost from purchases of consumer
durables in advance of the introduction of recycling fees for household
appliances in April. Both exports and imports fell, but the decline in exports, the
first quarterly fall in two years, was particularly pronounced. Last year's

IV-13
supplemental budget package resulted in a surge in government investment
which added nearly 1-1/2 percentage points to real GDP growth.

April data indicate a further contraction. Industrial production fell 2 percent to a
level about 3 percent below the first-quarter average, and the unemployment rate
edged up as another fall in employment reversed all of the gain that occurred
over the second half of last year. On the demand side, shipments of machinery
also registered a steep decline, led by weaker demand in the electrical category
that includes high-tech equipment. Machinery orders showed a surprisingly
large gain in April, but were still about 2-1/2 percent below the recent quarterly
peak at the end of last year, consistent with further declines in investment. In
addition, both residential and nonresidential building starts were well below
their first-quarter levels in April. Household spending also appears to be
weakening further, with April household expenditures 3 percent below their
first-quarter level, and new passenger car registrations down about 2 percent
over the same period.

Prices continue to decline. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 0.9 percent in May
from a year earlier. Deflation in wholesale prices for domestic goods has
intensified as the impact of the earlier run-up in energy prices has faded, with
prices in May down 0.6 percent from a year earlier. Land prices also have
continued to fall, with prices down 5 percent on average in January 2001 from a
year earlier. This marked the tenth consecutive year of decline in prices for both
residential and commercial property. The GDP deflator in the first quarter was a
little more than 1 percent below its year-earlier level.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) averaged $58 billion at
an annual rate in the first five months of this year, about half the level in the
same period in 2000. The declining trend in the surplus reflects the impact of
higher oil prices as well as slowing global demand.

IV-15
The Ministry of Finance's corporate survey showed a further deterioration in
business sentiment in the second quarter, with the diffusion index for large
corporations down to -12.1 percent from 1.2 percent in the first quarter.
Sentiment also declined sharply for both small and medium-sized firms. The
declines were generally more severe for manufacturers, but confidence fell for
non-manufacturers as well.
Prime Minister Koizumi continues to enjoy high approval ratings, but some of
the euphoria that surrounded his election has begun to fade. The government's
Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, which he chairs, recently released a
draft of a seven-point program for reform, scheduled to be formally announced
on June 27. Some elements, particularly a call for a reduction in public works
spending and a review of taxes earmarked for special purposes such as road-
building, are likely to face stiff opposition among entrenched interests in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The program reportedly will also include a
proposal to urge big banks to sell bad loans to the Resolution and Collection
Corporation (RCC) if they cannot eliminate them within two to three years, and
will recommend that the RCC also be allowed to act as a trustee entity to
manage the loans.
Real GDP in the euro area increased 2.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter,
only slightly below the average pace of growth in the second half of last year,
but with notably weak domestic demand. Consumption expenditures increased
only 1.3 percent, following two quarters of very modest growth, while fixed
investment spending fell 3.7 percent. Net exports contributed 2.4 percentage
points to growth, primarily reflecting a sizable decline in imports. Growth
remained subdued in Germany at only 1.5 percent; however, this was slightly
stronger than in the second half of last year. In France, growth slowed from a 3
percent pace to 2 percent, as a rebound in consumption was offset by a large
drawdown in inventories. Real GDP grew 3.4 percent in Italy, but the increase
in large part reflected a buildup in inventories.
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from the previous month,
primarily reflecting further increases in food and energy prices. The twelve-
month rate of consumer price inflation in the euro area rose to 3.4 percent, the
highest rate in eight years and remaining above the European Central Bank's 2
percent target ceiling for the twelfth consecutive month. The twelve-month rate
of core inflation (which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices) rose
to 2.1 percent in May.
Incoming data indicate weaker activity in the current quarter. Industrial
production declined 0.5 percent in April to a level slightly below the first-quarter

average. The euro-area purchasing managers' surveys for the manufacturing
sector moved down further in May, remaining below the level that indicates a
contraction in manufacturing activity for the second consecutive month. Service
sector purchasing managers' surveys indicate continued expansion of activity in
May, but at a much slower pace than a year ago. French consumption of
manufactured products fell somewhat in April, reversing some of the strength
early in the year.
Forward-looking indicators point to a subdued pace of activity in the months
ahead. German manufacturing orders declined for the fourth consecutive month
in April; both foreign and domestic orders have deteriorated. Euro-area
industrial confidence declined further in May, reflecting more negative opinions
on order books and levels of inventories. Euro-area consumer confidence
continues to be somewhat more upbeat, but confidence slipped in May, retracing

IV-17
some of the improvement from late last year, and largely reflecting increasing
concerns over unemployment.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole have yet to show deterioration, as
the harmonized unemployment rate for the euro area edged down to 8.3 percent
in April. Based on national statistics, the French unemployment rate was
unchanged at 8.7 percent in April after moving down in the first quarter. In
Germany, the unemployment rate has been unchanged at 9.3 percent from
January through May, while the number of unemployed has increased over this
period, reversing some of gains made in the second half of last year.
On May 10, the European Central Bank reduced its official interest rates 25
basis points, bringing the minimum bid rate for the main refinancing operation
to 4.5 percent. This was the first change to official rates since they were raised
25 basis points last October. The ECB noted that after adjusting for distortions
to annual M3 growth, monetary developments no longer pose a threat to price
stability. The ECB also noted that although inflation in the near term will
continue to be affected by temporary developments in food prices and the
indirect effects of past increases in oil prices and depreciation of the euro, a
moderation in real GDP growth is expected to dampen inflationary pressures in
the medium term. At its June 7 meeting, the ECB left policy rates unchanged.

Indicators for the second quarter paint a mixed picture. Consumer confidence
has ticked down in recent months but remains at a relatively high level. Retail
sales remained strong in April and May; for the two months on average, sales
are up 1.4 percent from the first-quarter average. Business confidence, on the
other hand, has fallen over the first five months of 2001, with manufacturing
confidence the lowest in over two years and industrial production declining 0.1
percent in April, slightly below its trend growth rate of zero. Foot and mouth
disease, contained at this point, is expected to have only a modest effect on
output in the tourism and transportation sectors this quarter.
Notwithstanding the recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate remained at 3.2 percent in
May, the lowest rate in 25 years, while the labor force survey measure of the
unemployment rate declined to a record low of 5 percent for the three months
centered in March. Average earnings growth in April ticked above the 4-1/2
percent rate (from year earlier) that the Bank of England believes to be
compatible with its inflation target, as demand for workers pushed up wage
costs. In May, the twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding
mortgage interest payments) jumped to 2.4 percent, reflecting a rise in food
prices.

At its June 6, 2001 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of
England voted to keep the official repo rate at 5.25 percent. The repo rate has
been cut 75 basis points since the beginning of this year.
Britain's Labour Party led by Prime Minister Tony Blair won a majority in the
general elections held on June 7. Prime Minister Blair indicated that if his
government were to pursue EMU entry in the near term (Labour ran on a pro-
EMU platform), the whole process should be completed before the next election,
which would imply that a referendum on EMU entry would have to take place
by early 2003.
Real GDP in Canada rose a stronger-than-expected 2.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
first quarter, up from a growth rate of 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000.
After growing 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, consumer spending rose 3.6
percent, led by purchases of durables goods. Government spending also picked
up from its 2000 pace, rising 4.8 percent in the quarter. However, despite a
boom in residential investment, fixed investment continued to decline, reflecting
a broad-based decline in machinery and equipment investment. Inventory

IV-21
investment also slowed further, subtracting 1 percentage point from growth.
Exports fell by 5.7 percent, with rising exports of energy products offset by large
declines in exports of machinery and equipment and motor vehicles. Mainly as a
result of a substantial decline in imports, however, net exports added nearly 2
percentage points to first-quarter growth.

Limited available data for the current quarter suggest the Canadian economy
likely slowed from the first quarter pace. Data on housing starts through May
suggest residential investment has cooled. The manufacturing sector continues
to be weak, with manufacturing shipments declining in April and manufacturing
employment falling on average in April and May. Consumer confidence
continued to decline in the first quarter, suggesting consumption growth may
slow in the second quarter.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 3.9 percent in May,
above the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target range for
the second consecutive month. Higher energy and food prices continued to
account for much of the increase in consumer prices, as the twelve-month core
rate of inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was a more moderate
2.1 percent.

The Bank of Canada has lowered its policy rate, the Bank Rate, a total of 125
basis points this year, most recently by 25 basis points on May 29. The Bank
Rate now stands at 4.75 percent. In its May 29 statement, the Bank singled out a
pace of economic expansion that was currently below trend as justification for
the rate reduction. The Bank reaffirmed its view that the main risk to the
Canadian outlook is the possibility of a longer-than-anticipated economic
slowdown in the United States, but also mentioned that "given the sustained
increases in energy prices, the Bank will need to be vigilant for signs of broader
effects on consumer prices generally." The Bank's next policy announcement
date is July 17.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In the major developing countries, the overall pace of economic growth has
recently declined, reflecting sluggish external demand and weak domestic
conditions. Recent data on real GDP, industrial production, and especially
exports have shown slowing or outright declines in most countries. Inflation
remains subdued, with some isolated exceptions.
In Argentina, data since the last Greenbook provide little indication that a
concerted recovery is underway. Industrial production climbed for the second
consecutive month in April; however, the April gain was concentrated almost
entirely in a few industries-rubber, plastics, and chemicals. Inflation, as
measured over the past twelve months, also turned positive for the first time
since February 1999, but special factors-including an increase in the tariff rate
on consumption goods-were largely responsible for this rise. Tax receipts
jumped in May following weak April returns, mostly reflecting gains from the
newly implemented tax on financial transactions and taxes on revenues from
Argentina's largest oil producer. Revenues from the VAT fell year on year,
however, suggesting continued weak economic activity. Consumer confidence
fell in May but picked up somewhat in early June in the aftermath of the
successful debt swap. The trade balance remained positive again in April, as
exports rose and imports were flat.
On June 4, the Argentine government announced the results of a "mega" debt
exchange. In the exchange, the Argentine government traded $29.5 billion in
old debt for $30.4 billion in new bonds, with higher-than-expected foreign
participation of about $8 billion. The average life of the new debt was roughly
three years longer than that of the previous bonds, and the exchange generated
about $16 billion in cash flow savings through 2005. While the exchange
lightened the financing burden in the near term, it was fairly costly, with yields
of up to 16 percent.
Further policy changes were announced by Argentine Finance Minister Cavallo
on June 15. Of the changes, market attention focused primarily on a
controversial exchange-rate-based system of import taxes and export subsidies.
The system establishes an "equivalent transaction rate" on all traded goods
except liquid fuels. The transaction rate is calculated on a daily basis as the
difference between the exchange rate that would prevail under the "Enhanced
Convertibility Law," in which a peso is backed by a simple average of one dollar
and one euro, and the exchange rate of one peso per dollar. The transaction rate
is currently between 7 and 8 percent. Exporters receive a subsidy equal to the
transaction rate, while importers pay a tax equal to that rate. Other less
contentious measures included changes to the tax code designed to combat tax

IV-27
evasion and boost domestic demand. Immediate reaction to the announcement
was not positive, with analysts expressing intensified doubts about Argentina's
commitment to its currency board arrangement.

In Mexico, economic activity continued to fall, largely reflecting weak external
demand. Real GDP fell nearly 1-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, the
second consecutive quarterly decline, and industrial production decreased
slightly further in April. Exports fell over 4 percent (s.a.) in April, leading to a
sharp increase in the trade deficit. However, the current account deficit in the
first quarter narrowed slightly to about $18 billion (a.r.) relative to its value in
the same quarter a year ago, as four-quarter import growth slowed sharply.
Inflation has remained subdued, with twelve-month consumer price inflation
coming in at 7 percent in May, only slightly above the year-end target of
6-1/2 percent.
In an environment with a very strong peso, declining inflation, and weak
economic activity, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) loosened monetary policy
towards the end of May for the first time in three years. Concurrently, the BOM
also announced two changes in its mechanisms for foreign exchange operations.
First, it suspended its monthly auctions of U.S. dollar put options, which was its
preferred method of building up foreign exchange reserves. Second, the BOM
announced that it will be suspending from July the automatic intervention that
comes into play if the peso depreciates 2 percent or more in a single day.

IV-28
Getting rid of the "2-percent rule" will let the peso change more freely in
response to downward market pressures.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have pointed to a slowdown in
economic activity. Real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Industrial production declined nearly 2 percent over the March-April
period, and unemployment edged up in April. The trade deficit widened despite
the slowdown. Inflation also rose, driven by rises in food prices, depreciation of
the real, hikes in transportation costs, and liberalization of some fuel prices.
The real, which has depreciated 20 percent since the beginning of the
year, continued to move lower over the inter-meeting period as a result of
adverse spillovers from Argentina, an energy crisis, and political troubles at
home. In mid-May, the government announced an energy rationing scheme to
be put in place for much of the country over the second half of this year in
response to dangerously low levels of water. (Eighty-five percent of Brazil's
electricity comes from hydropower.)

IV-29
The central bank reacted to the rise in inflationary pressures and the weakness of
the real by raising the overnight interest rate, the Selic, by 50 basis points to
16.75 percent. This action brought the cumulative rate increase since March to
150 basis points. The primary fiscal surplus over the first four months of this
year exceeded the target envisioned in Brazil's IMF program. However, the rise
in the Selic and the depreciation of the real have greatly raised the government's
debt servicing costs, because most of the government's debt is linked to the
Selic or to foreign currencies. Brazil's government nevertheless announced that
it would not renew its IMF program when it expires at the end of 2001.

In Venezuela, real GDP rose less than 1 percent in the first quarter, after soaring
in the fourth quarter of last year. The high price of oil and government spending
are still the main drivers of the economy, although some strength has been seen
in the non-oil sectors, particularly in the communication industry. The current
account balance showed a smaller surplus in the first quarter, reflecting lower oil
exports and a rise in imports. Inflation ticked up in May.

In Korea, recent indicators suggest that activity has remained weak. Real GDP
increased only slightly in the first quarter, not quite reversing the decline of the
previous quarter. Consumption was particularly weak in the first quarter, and
only a surprising boost from net exports kept overall growth positive. Industrial
output fell in April after three consecutive months of increase, depressed by
declines in production of semiconductors and office equipment. Inventories rose
in April, pushing the inventory to sales ratio up further. Recent readings of
forward-looking indicators of activity have been somewhat less bleak, with
indexes of both business and consumer sentiment remaining well above their
low points of late last year.
Despite the ongoing weakness of economic activity, twelve-month consumer
price inflation has risen in recent months, reflecting in large part the delayed
impact of earlier depreciation of the won and higher energy prices, as well as
unusually sharp seasonal jumps in some agricultural prices. With inflation well
above its 2-4 percent target range, the Bank of Korea has not lowered its target
interest rate since February, despite the weakness of economic activity.

In the ASEAN region, recent data have been mixed. Both Indonesia and
Malaysia registered strong GDP growth in the first quarter, while the Philippines
posted negative growth and Singapore GDP plummeted more than 10 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Industrial production fell throughout the region, and recent monthly
production data generally point to further weakness.
Recent trade data have shown declines in both exports and imports. Exports
were below their year-ago levels in almost every country, with electronics
exports being the hardest hit. The fall in imports primarily reflected a drop in
demand for components used in the production of high-tech exports. Inflation
has remained quite well contained in the region, with the notable exception of
Indonesia.

In China, recent indicators suggest that growth has moderated from its rapid
pace in the first quarter. Industrial output rose 10.2 percent in May from the
same month last year, somewhat slower than the twelve-month growth rates
registered earlier this year. China has begun to feel the impact of the global
slowdown, with exports falling in both April and May. Imports have also
weakened, largely reflecting the high import content of Chinese exports. Robust
domestic demand continued to support growth, however, with indicators of
consumer and investment spending remaining strong. Investment was boosted
by increased government spending on infrastructure and a pickup in inflows of
foreign direct investment. Partly reflecting the strength of domestic demand, the
twelve-month inflation rate moved up to 1.7 percent in May, the highest rate in
nearly four years.

In Hong Kong, real GDP rose 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, with
increased private consumption being roughly offset by a drop in exports.
Consumer spending was boosted by unusually large year-end bonuses for 2000,
which were paid out in early 2001. Exports continued to slide in April, falling to
a level about 7 percent (s.a.) below their first-quarter average. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.6 percent (s.a.) in the March-May
period. The twelve-month rate of decline in consumer prices eased further in
April, as prices ticked up on a seasonally adjusted basis. In an effort to revive
the depressed property market, the government recently announced measures to
curb the supply of new housing.

In Taiwan, weak global demand for high-technology products, compounded by
the increasing trend for Taiwanese firms to move their production to China to
reduce production costs, continued to weigh on economic activity. Real GDP
fell 2.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, dragged down by plunging real
exports and business investment spending. Private consumption was essentially
flat, reflecting the dampening effects of deteriorating labor market conditions.
More recent data point to further declines in economic activity, with industrial
production falling 4.4 percent (s.a.) and the unemployment rate rising to
4.3 percent in April. In addition, exports tumbled 12 percent (s.a.) in May,
pulled down by sharply lower exports of electronics and information technology
products. Imports fell even more, led by a plunge in capital goods imports.
Consumer prices fell slightly in May on a twelve-month basis. In response to
the latest signs of economic weakness, Taiwan's central bank has cut interest
rates 25 basis points since the last Greenbook, and the legislature has passed a
fiscal stimulus package to boost public infrastructure spending.
