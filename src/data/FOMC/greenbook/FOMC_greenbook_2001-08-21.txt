1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Overview
The economy appears to have reached midsummer with only slight forward
momentum. The news from the tech sector can only be characterized as bleak,
and business investment more generally is in a deep slump. In many
manufacturing industries, shipments remain soft, and sharp production cutbacks
have not yet succeeded in bringing inventory-shipments ratios down to
comfortable levels. However, household expenditures on consumption items
and residential investment continue to hold up reasonably well. With energy
prices having turned down and core inflation well behaved, overall consumer
price inflation has eased a bit in recent months after a mild uptick earlier in the
year. Indicators of wage inflation are sending somewhat mixed signals but, on
balance, seem also to have moderated lately.
Real GDP
According to the advance estimate prepared by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA), real GDP increased at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the
second quarter. However, new data on inventory investment and construction
expenditures came in weaker than the BEA had assumed in the advance
estimate. We estimate that the change in real GDP will be marked down to an
annual rate of 0.2 percent. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion of second-
quarter activity in this section of the Greenbook incorporates our expected
revisions to GDP and related measures.

Employment and Labor Productivity
Labor demand continued to weaken around midyear. Private nonfarm
employment fell in three of the past four months, with net job losses totaling
nearly 400,000 over that period; the drop in July was 73,000, led by further
declines in manufacturing and in help supply services. Against that backdrop,
we are discounting the recent flatness of the unemployment rate as a sign that
labor market conditions have stabilized.
Manufacturing employment fell 49,000 in July, after average monthly declines
of 115,000 in the second quarter. Almost all the job losses in July occurred in
industrial machinery and electrical equipment; these industries, parts of which
are involved in the production of computers, telecommunications equipment,
and semiconductors, have accounted for 40 percent of factory job losses since
the beginning of the year. Employment in help supply services, which is closely
linked to manufacturing, has declined 80,000 over the past two months.
Industry contacts cited weak demand among both traditional manufacturing and
high-tech firms as having contributed to the decline.
Outside of manufacturing and help supply services, labor demand remained
quite weak in recent months, with most industries experiencing little or no
employment growth. The services industry excluding help supply added only
19,000 jobs last month, and the average monthly gain of 41,000 since the start
of the second quarter was the smallest four-month average since 1992.
Elsewhere, employment in retail trade rose only 6,000 in July, while
employment in the construction industry and in the finance, insurance, and real
estate industry, which had expanded throughout the first part of the year,
experienced net employment declines in June and July.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls inched down 0.1 percent in July after having dipped 0.2 percent in
June; these cutbacks raise the prospect of a second consecutive quarterly decline
in aggregate labor input. The recent declines have been primarily due to falling
employment; the workweek has held steady at 34.2 hours since April.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate stood at 4.5 percent in July,
0.6 percentage point above the low of 3.9 percent reached in September and
October but unchanged since April. Given the declines in payroll employment
over the past several months, the absence of a further rise in the jobless rate is
somewhat puzzling, although such discrepancies are not unprecedented.
Nonetheless, the data from the payroll survey suggest a further rise in
joblessness in coming months.
According to estimates from the BLS, an average of 370,000 initial claims for
unemployment insurance were filed in the four weeks ended August 11-40,000

per week fewer than in late June. However, as often happens in the summer,
recent movements in weekly unemployment insurance claims were significantly
affected by temporary plant closings in the motor vehicle and textile industries
that vary in their timing from year to year. This year, on a published basis,
initial claims shot up in early July and then tumbled later in the month. To
better account for shifts in the timing of these summer shutdowns, the Board
staff has developed alternative seasonal factors for the claims data.1 The
resulting seasonally adjusted series is less volatile than the published series; it
shows about a flat level of claims, on net, since late June. Both sets of seasonal
factors show levels of claims in the latest week that are about 80,000 above the
average for 2000. Also, using the Board's alternative seasonal adjustment
procedures, the level of insured unemployment rose approximately 600,000
between late January and late June and has crept up since then.
Other labor market indicators have been broadly consistent with sluggish labor
demand, but, for the most part, these did not worsen significantly in July.
According to the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), small
firms, on net, continued to report sharply lower hiring plans compared with last
year, although hiring plans did turn up in July. From the household perspective,
the Conference Board reported that the gap between those reporting that jobs
were plentiful and those reporting that jobs were hard to get, which narrowed by
20 percentage points over the past year, was little changed in July.
Nevertheless, other measures portrayed a labor market that was still moderately
tight. According to the NFIB, more than a quarter of small firms report having
at least one position that has been hard to fill. This measure, which dropped
significantly from July of last year through March, has been roughly unchanged
since; the latest reading was similar to those seen in 1997, when the
unemployment rate was a touch below 5 percent.
The staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at
an annual rate of almost 2 percent in the second quarter of 2001 after little
change in the first quarter.2 Recent quarterly movements in productivity have
been heavily influenced by fluctuations in hours of self-employed workers,
which are developed from data collected in the household survey. Measured
using the hours of employees, which make up 90 percent of the hours of all
workers, output per hour increased at annual rates of almost 1 percent in the first
1. Compared with those used by the BLS, the seasonal adjustment procedures developed by
the Board staff use a locally weighted regression technique that better accounts for shifts over
time in the seasonal pattern of weekly claims.
2. The latest Productivity and Cost release also included revised productivity estimates for
1996:Q1 to 2001:Q1. These estimates reflected the annual revisions to the NIPA, the benchmark
revisions to the Current Employment Statistics that were released on June 1, and revised
seasonal factors. On balance, productivity was revised down over this period. The appendix
describes these revisions in more detail.

quarter and 1-1/4 percent in the second quarter. Nevertheless, on either basis,
productivity has slowed appreciably over the past year. In the four quarters
ended in 2001:Q2, productivity measured using hours of all persons increased
only 1-1/2 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent in the four quarters
ended in 2000:Q2. Similarly, the output per hour of employees increased
1-1/4 percent in the four quarters ended in 2001:Q2, compared with
3-1/2 percent in the preceding four quarters. For both measures, the magnitude
of the deceleration in productivity over the past year, given the slowdown in
output, is roughly in line with historical experience.
Industrial Production and Inventories
Industrial production. Total industrial production edged down 0.1 percent in
July after larger drops in the previous three months. Motor vehicle assemblies
rose 370,000 units, to an annual rate of 12.1 million units, in July. However, the
production of high-tech goods fell 2-1/2 percent-the biggest one-month decline
since October 1989. Aside from motor vehicles and high-tech equipment,
manufacturing production ticked down 0.1 percent last month; whether that
flatness represents the start of a bottoming out in the non-high-tech sector is not
clear, given the many other indicators that are still soft. The output at mines and

utilities decreased moderately again. For manufacturing as a whole, the factory
operating rate slipped to 75.6 percent in July, 6 percentage points lower than a
year ago, when it stood at about its long-term average. In July, high-tech
industries were operating about 15 percentage points below the long-run average
capacity utilization rate, while outside of the high-tech sector the gap was
around 4-1/2 percentage points.
High-tech. Conditions in the high-tech sector remain quite weak. In July,
production of semiconductors dropped 2-3/4 percent, about the same rate of
decline as in the previous three months. Moreover, Dataquest's latest survey of
large semiconductor buyers indicated that chip demand is likely to remain
subdued and that actual days' supply rose a little further above target in July.
Meanwhile, analysts have pushed back their forecasts for a turnaround in the
semiconductor industry until the end of the year. Downstream, the production
of computers slipped 3/4 percent in July and decreased 9 percent over the
previous twelve months. Sales were abysmal in the first half of 2001,
particularly for personal computers, despite an ongoing price war among major
manufacturers. The output of communications equipment makers tumbled
nearly 4 percent in July; since the end of last year, production has plunged at an
annual rate of nearly 19 percent. According to recent earnings announcements,
several producers of communications equipment expect revenues to decline
further in the third quarter and orders-which plummeted in June-to remain
low. In addition, since the last Greenbook, several high-tech equipment
manufacturers have announced sizable layoffs.
Motor vehicles. In the motor vehicle sector, the July increase in assemblies
came in the face of some renewed slippage in demand. Sales of new light
vehicles for the month were at an annual rate of 16.3 million units, down from
17.1 million units in June. The decline in July occurred despite the continuation
of many of the sales incentives that were initiated in the previous month and,
according to industry analysts on a confidential basis, an advance in fleet sales.
The automakers often use fleet sales to help smooth production, but with fleet
purchases having been kept elevated for some time now, a retrenchment could
be in the offing. With regard to retail demand, we expect automakers to keep
using generous incentive programs to try to offset some of the negative
influence of sluggish income growth and a subdued stock market, although the
power of such incentives to draw in customers may be waning.
5. The announced layoffs were 7,000 for JDS Uniphase, 6,000 for Hewlett-Packard, 15,000
to 20,000 for Lucent, and 2,500 for Alcatel. In the case of the first three firms, these layoffs are
for worldwide operations. JDS Uniphase is a Canadian firm with U.S. operations; H-P and
Lucent are based in the United States. Alcatel is a French firm, but the 2,500 layoffs apply to
work in the United States, including the closing of a plant in North Carolina.

Inventories of automobiles are, if anything, on the lean side. For light trucks,
however, the combination of a dropback in sales and a spurt in assemblies in
July pushed the days' supply above the comfortable range of 65 to 70 days.
Despite these developments, manufacturers have revised up scheduled truck
production in August and September from already high levels. If third-quarter
assemblies of these vehicles come in as scheduled and sales ease further (as we
expect), a steep cutback in production seems likely to ensue.

Other manufacturing. Outside of the motor vehicle and high-tech industries,
production cutbacks this year have been widespread, and the diffusion index of
three-month percent changes in IP-at 32.2 percent-remained in July at a level
typically associated with recessions. The recent cutbacks in industrial materials
and business supplies have been less severe than the earlier declines, on average,
while business equipment production has been dropping off at a more
pronounced rate.
Aggregate inventories. After a sizable liquidation in the first quarter, the
overall pace of inventory decumulation was a bit more rapid in the second
quarter. We now estimate that real nonfarm inventories decreased at an annual
rate of around $35 billion in the second quarter, following a drop of $27 billion

in the first quarter.6 As a result, the change in nonfarm inventory investment
shaved more than 1/4 percentage point from the change in GDP last quarter,
after having subtracted 2-1/2 percentage points from the first-quarter figure.
Given our estimate that final sales inched up last quarter, the real inventory-
sales ratio dropped a bit further.
We also estimate that, in real terms, manufacturers liquidated inventories at an
annual rate of $24 billion last quarter, following a $15 billion drawdown in the
first quarter. Much of the liquidation occurred at manufacturers of computers
and electronic products; however, shipments by these producers also plunged in
the second quarter, and the inventory-shipments ratio in this sector rose further
from an already high level. Elsewhere in manufacturing, inventories and
shipments fell roughly in tandem last quarter, and the inventory-sales ratio held
steady. Nevertheless, stocks remained stubbornly high relative to shipments in a
number of manufacturing sectors (metals, furniture, chemicals, and rubber and
plastics), despite aggressive production cutbacks.
Real wholesale inventories (excluding motor vehicles) are estimated to have
risen $4-1/2 billion (annual rate) last quarter, after little change in the first
quarter. In book-value terms, non-auto distributors built stocks at an annual rate
of $5-1/2 billion, as a large drawdown of stocks at durable goods wholesalers
(particularly electrical goods jobbers) was more than offset by an accumulation
at distributors of nondurable goods (especially drug wholesalers). Sales have
been sluggish of late, and the ratio of inventories to sales moved sharply higher
in the second quarter. This ratio has been rising, on balance, since early last
year and is now approaching the high levels recorded in late 1998 and early
1999.
According to our estimates, real retail inventories (excluding motor vehicles)
decreased $7-3/4 billion (annual rate) in the second quarter, following a slight
accumulation in the first quarter. In book value terms, non-auto retailers
liquidated stocks at an annual rate of $8.2 billion last quarter, reflecting
moderate-sized liquidations spread among most of the major types of stores. In
addition, for most categories of retail outlets, inventory-sales ratios edged lower
in the second quarter.
Consumer Spending and Personal Income
Real consumer spending slowed to an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent in the second
quarter, but it may be poised for a somewhat faster rise in the third quarter. The
underlying pace of income growth has slowed in recent quarters with the
6. In book-value terms, manufacturing and trade inventory investment (excluding motor
vehicles) in the second quarter was $15 billion lower, on balance, than the BEA had assumed in
the advance NIPA estimate.

softening in the labor market, but tax rebates will provide a substantial boost this
quarter. Stock-market values have eroded further this year, shaving household
balance sheets a bit more. Consumer confidence appears to have stabilized at
moderately favorable levels in recent months, after having fallen precipitously
around the turn of the year.
In July, nominal sales at stores in the retail control group rose 0.2 percent.7
With the exception of gasoline stations, where lower retail prices led to a sizable
drop in nominal sales, retailers reported widespread and robust gains.8 All told,
we estimate that real consumer outlays for goods (including motor vehicles and
energy products) advanced 0.4 percent in July to a level 0.6 percent (not at an
annual rate) above the second-quarter average.
Estimates of expenditures on services are available only through June; in the
second quarter, real service outlays rose at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent.
Spending on services was held down in the second quarter by steep declines in
outlays for electricity and natural gas, likely reflecting both cooler-than-average
temperatures and cutbacks in purchases of energy services in response to the
cumulative run-up in prices.9 Outside of energy, outlays for services increased
2-3/4 percent last quarter.
Real disposable personal income increased 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter,
after having risen 2-3/4 percent in the first quarter. The gains in income were
similar to the rise in consumer spending over these two quarters, a markedly
different situation from the pattern in recent years when a sizable run-up in
household net worth led to increases in spending that outpaced income growth
by a wide margin. After having climbed to an historical high in the first quarter
of 2000, the ratio of net worth relative to income has moved lower, and the
personal saving rate has edged up.10 The labor market data for July suggest that
wage and salary income probably posted a modest gain last month.
7. The retail control is calculated as total nominal retail and food services sales less retail
sales at automobile and other motor vehicle dealerships and at building material and supply
stores.
8. Physical product data from the Department of Energy indicate that real purchases of
gasoline increased noticeably in July.
9. The PCE price index for natural gas and electricity jumped at an annual rate of nearly
36 percent in the first quarter. It declined at an annual rate of 1 percent in the second quarter.
Over the past four quarters, it is up more than 15 percent.
10. In the annual revision to the NIPA, the personal saving rate was revised up substantially
to show, on net, much less of a decline over the past three years than had been previously
estimated. Before the revision, the saving rate in recent years had fallen by more than our
estimates of the wealth effect would have indicated; the NIPA revision brought saving into better
alignment with wealth.

Consumer sentiment, as measured by both the Michigan Survey Research
Center (SRC) and the Conference Board, was little changed in July, and both
measures have fluctuated within very narrow ranges since early this year. The
SRC index of the expected change in unemployment rose slightly in July;
however, on balance, it has drifted lower since the early spring, suggesting that
consumers' expectations of labor market conditions over the coming twelve
months have improved somewhat from earlier in the year.
Housing Markets
Supported by low mortgage rates, single-family housing activity has held up
well in recent months despite the softening economy." Single-family starts in
July rose to an annual rate of 1.30 million units, which is slightly above the high
level in the second quarter. In contrast, adjusted permits fell in July to an
annual rate of 1.24 million units. With single-family starts well above adjusted
permits, the starts estimate likely overstates the underlying pace of single-
family homebuilding last month.
Sales of new homes rose in June to 922,000 units (annual rate) and, with the
stock of new homes for sale at a low 292,000 units, the months' supply stood at
just 3.9 months. The pace of sales in the second quarter matched the average
for the latter half of last year. Sales of existing homes edged down to 5.3
million units (annual rate) in June, but still were only slightly below the
historical peak for this series.
Other indicators of housing demand also show continued strength. The
Michigan Survey's measure of households' perceptions of homebuying
conditions has trended up since the middle of last year, though a decline in July
partly reversed a jump in June. Also, the Mortgage Bankers' Association index
of purchase applications for home mortgages remained near the top of its range
through early August, and builders' rating of new home sales rose noticeably in
August to its highest level since last November. Data from the Senior Loan
Officers Opinion Survey for August indicate that the demand at commercial
banks for new mortgages to purchase homes has remained robust.
Increases in house prices have moderated only a little so far this year. The
constant-quality new home price index, which controls for differences over time
in house size, geography, and several important structural characteristics, rose
3-3/4 percent over the four quarters ended in the second quarter, as compared
11. From April through July, the average rate on fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) was
unchanged, on balance, while the average rate on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) fell 35 basis
points. ARM financing lowers the initial out-of-pocket cost of home ownership and helps to
support housing demand by buyers who are willing to assume the risk that mortgage rates may
rise. The share of mortgage originations with adjustable rates has risen slightly from the recent
low of 10 percent in March and April to 12 percent in May and June (latest data).

with 5 percent in the previous year. The repeat-sales price index for existing
homes, which also is relatively unaffected by compositional changes because it
compares prices for the same housing units over time, increased 8-1/2 percent
over the four quarters ended in the second quarter, only a percentage point less
rapid than the first quarter's record-high pace.12
In the multifamily sector, starts increased to an annual rate of 368,000 units in
July-the second highest reading in the past year and a half. However, starts
were extraordinarily high relative to permits, which suggests that the underlying
pace of construction is noticeably below the level reported in July. The vacancy
rate for multifamily rental units was 8-3/4 percent in the second quarter-about
the same relatively low rate as a year earlier.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Business spending on equipment and software has
continued to retreat at a rapid pace. Real outlays are estimated to have
decreased at an annual rate of 14-1/2 percent in the second quarter, a much
faster decline than in the preceding two quarters. The weakness in investment
reflects sluggish growth in business output and a nosedive in corporate cash
flow. Against these forces, a continued decline in the cost of capital has had
only a small cushioning effect. We have no direct evidence on investment in
the current quarter, but both the June data on orders and shipments of capital
goods and numerous anecdotal reports point to another sizable drop in spending.
The situation in the high-tech sector remains grim. Real expenditures on
computer hardware and software sank at an annual rate of 13-3/4 percent in the
second quarter, the largest decline since 1982. Shipments of computing
equipment fell 6-3/4 percent in June, implying a very weak trajectory heading
into the third quarter, and several major computer hardware and software
makers have reported that they expect the weakness to continue. Demand for
communications equipment has been exceptionally weak of late. Real spending
in this category plummeted at an annual rate of nearly 40 percent in both the
first and second quarters, and outlays for communications equipment appear to
be poised for another terrible performance in the third quarter: Bookings took
another nosedive in June, and the level of new orders has now fallen back to
where it stood in late 1996.
Moreover, recent survey results offer little hope of an improvement in the high-
tech sector in the latter part of the year. A Merrill Lynch survey of 65 chief

1987.

financial officers and chief technology officers found that 72 percent believe
that technology spending will be flat or down in the second half compared with
a year ago; a Morgan Stanley poll reported that a majority of 225 tech buyers
plan to cut or slow spending. These survey results are consistent with the
downbeat reports from our own informal business contacts and with anecdotes
in the Beige Book.
Business spending on aircraft has remained relatively unscathed so far this year.
We estimate that real expenditures on aircraft advanced moderately in the
second quarter as both Airbus and Boeing stepped up deliveries to domestic
airlines. Deliveries to U.S. customers remained quite strong in July.
Real spending on equipment outside of the high-tech and transportation
categories decreased at an annual rate of 12-1/2 percent in the second quarter.
The weakness reflected sharply lower outlays on almost all types of machinery.
The only notable exceptions were gains in expenditures on machinery that is
typically purchased by the service industry, the mining sector (which includes
oil and gas extraction), and the health care industry. Overall, spending on
equipment and machinery (excluding high-tech and transportation) appears
likely to continue to decline in coming months. New orders for this grouping
dropped 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter (not at an annual rate), and the level
of unfilled orders fell further.
Nonresidential construction. The weakness in the business sector is beginning
to show through to spending on nonresidential structures. After having held up
surprisingly well through the first quarter, outlays for nonresidential
construction plunged at an annual rate of 13-1/2 percent in the second quarter,
as expenditures for office, industrial, and lodging facilities all contracted
sharply.13
Real spending for construction of office buildings plummeted in the second
quarter, following a smaller decline in the preceding quarter. Demand, as
measured by the net change in occupied space, contracted noticeably in the first
13. Our estimates for nonresidential structures reflect benchmark revisions to the
construction-put-in-place data (extending as far back as 1993 in some cases) that were
released after the NIPA report. Total nonresidential expenditures, in real terms, were
revised down in 1999 and 2000 by $2 billion and $7 billion respectively. These revisions
primarily reflected large reductions in the estimates for industrial structures owing to
newly available source data. Also, the Census Bureau had been inappropriately including
investment by independent power producers both in the public utilities and in the industrial
structures components of private nonresidential structures. The benchmark revisions removed
these expenditures from the industrial construction category.

half of 2001, marking the first semiannual decline on record.14 Moreover, the
vacancy rate for office buildings has increased significantly over the past two
quarters. The largest increases in office vacancy rates have been in high-
technology centers, where earlier expectations of rapid expansion in operations
had led some firms to lease office space and data centers in anticipation of
future needs. With the technology sector now contracting, substantial amounts
of such space have become available for subleasing.
Real outlays for industrial buildings declined at an annual rate of 20 percent in
the second quarter, about reversing the rise posted in the first quarter.
Moreover, demand for industrial space has dropped back sharply as well. The
amount of occupied industrial space plunged during the first half of this year,
and the vacancy rate for industrial buildings jumped up.15 The weakening
demand for industrial property has been widespread both in areas where high-
technology manufacturing businesses are concentrated and where other types of
manufacturers are located.
Spending for other commercial structures (which include retail space and
warehouses) dropped at an annual rate of 18-1/2 percent in the second quarter,
erasing a first-quarter increase, and outlays for lodging and other miscellaneous
facilities fell another 25 percent. In addition, construction outlays by public
utilities decreased at an annual rate of 8-1/2 percent last quarter: However,
given the continuing need for expansion of power-generation capacity, the
second-quarter drop is more likely a temporary pause rather than the beginning
of a sustained downturn in activity. Elsewhere, on the positive side,
expenditures for drilling and mining soared at an annual rate of 44 percent in the
second quarter following a 68 percent surge in the first quarter.
Government Sector
Federal. The federal unified budget surplus has deteriorated recently, reflecting
a significantly weaker trend in incoming receipts. On the legislative front, two
small supplemental appropriations bills for fiscal 2001 were enacted, one for
defense and one for agriculture subsidies.
Federal receipts in June were 5-1/2 percent lower than in June 2000. Gross
corporate income tax collections plummeted 25 percent in June; this decline
14. The available historical data for this series are semiannual and date back to the second
half of 1988.
15. Over the first half of this year, vacancy rates for office buildings shot up in both
downtown and suburban markets. In downtown areas, the vacancy rate in the second quarter
was 8-1/2 percent, up from 6-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. In suburban markets, the
rise over this period was from 9-1/4 percent to 12 percent.

largely reflected the second quarterly installment of estimated taxes on profits
expected to be earned in 2001, and it followed an 11 percent drop in April (the
deadline month for the first estimated payment).16 Individual nonwithheld
income and payroll taxes edged down in June (also a deadline month for
quarterly estimated payments) relative to June 2000. This ended the string of
robust double-digit increases seen in this category over the past six years.
Compared with a year ago, withheld income and payroll taxes also edged down
in June and for the second quarter were only 3 percent higher than last year.
Federal outlays soared in June, rising 7-1/2 percent above last year's level. In
part, this increase owed to upward-revised estimates of the costs of loan
programs, but it also reflected a pickup in Medicare spending that began this
spring and rising payments of unemployment benefits.
Slumping receipts and the surge in outlays in June held the overall unified
budget surplus to $32 billion, some $24 billion lower than last June. After
having peaked at nearly $270 billion in the twelve months ended in January, the
twelve-month surplus declined to $230 billion in June. In the third quarter, the
surplus will be depressed further because of the disbursement of individual
income tax rebate checks and the delay in corporate income tax payments, as
provided in the 2001 Tax Act.17
Before the August recess, the Congress passed two supplemental appropriations
bills for fiscal 2001. The defense bill provides $6-1/2 billion in spending,
spread over several years, and the agriculture spending bill provides
$5-1/2billion in emergency subsidies to be paid by the end of September. Work
on the thirteen regular appropriations bills for fiscal 2002 has been uneventful
thus far: The House has passed nine bills, and the Senate has passed five bills-
all in line with the Budget Resolution and the administration's requests. That
said, little progress has been made on the two key bills-Defense and
Labor/HHS/Education-that are widely expected to determine whether overall
appropriations stay within the budget outlines.
State and local. We estimate that real spending by state and local governments
increased at an annual rate of 7-1/2 percent in the second quarter, following an
16. These tax payments appear consistent with the available data on corporate earnings
(although they may also reflect developments in other elements of taxable income, such as
capital gains realizations and bad-debt write-offs).
17. The Treasury has been mailing about $3-1/2 billion in rebate checks each week since
July 20 and expects to complete the issuance by the end of September.

upward revised 6-1/2 percent advance in the first quarter.18 The two-quarter
gain reflects unusually large increases in most major spending categories. In
terms of investment spending, capital expenditures by state and local
governments had been inexplicably weak last year despite favorable
fundamentals-notably, low interest rates and robust budget surpluses-and a
continuing need to repair and expand existing infrastructure. However,
spending surged in the first half of this year, bringing most components of state
and local construction up to record high levels. Meanwhile, the rise in real
compensation paid to state and local workers stepped up in the first half of the
year, as increases in employment far exceeded the gains seen in 2000. Another
large increase in employment was registered in July.
With the pace of spending by state and local governments up in the first half of
this year and revenues rising more slowly than during 2000, the surplus of
operating accounts (measured in relation to GDP) appears to have fallen in the
second quarter to its lowest level since the end of 1995. Indeed, in recent fiscal
surveys of both state and city governments, many officials have reported that
their budget conditions have begun to tighten.19 According to the National
Conference of State Legislatures, states reported a decline in general fund
balances (as a percentage of expenditures) in fiscal 2001 for the first time since
fiscal 1992.20 State tax revenue rose just 4.5 percent in fiscal 2001, roughly half
the pace registered in the previous year. On the spending side, outlays for
Medicaid jumped 14 percent in fiscal 2001, more than double the pace that had
been budgeted. Furthermore, many states reported that they expect another
decline in general fund balances in 2002, citing, among other reasons, the
likelihood of relatively weak income and sales tax collections. A survey of
cities from the National League of Cities conveyed a similar message: In fiscal
2001, officials in proportionately more cities than in any year since 1994
reported a reduction in their ability to meet financial obligations.21
Prices
Consumer price inflation has eased in recent months, as energy prices have
turned down and increases in core consumer prices have subsided from their
18. Our second-quarter estimate takes account of the June construction-put-in-place data that
were released after the NIPA report. Also, the surplus of operating accounts in the second
quarter is a staff estimate because corporate profits and profits taxes are not yet available.
19. This year's survey of states reports expenditures and revenue for forty-six states; it
excludes Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Tennessee, whose fiscal 2002 budgets
had not been adopted by time of the report's deadline. The city report is based on a sample
survey of large and medium-sized cities and may include different cities from year to year.
20. The general fund balance is the surplus in the current year plus the cumulation of all
prior years' surpluses; it is considered a barometer of the fiscal well-being of the state.
21. Each city was asked to answer the survey in terms of its own fiscal year, which
corresponds to the calendar year for about 40 percent of cities. Another 40 percent end their
fiscal years on June 30, and the timing for the fiscal year is mixed for the rest.

more rapid first-quarter pace. The core CPI moved up 0.2 percent in July and
has increased 2.7 percent over the past twelve months. Although up
0.2 percentage point from its year-earlier reading, this twelve-month change has
held steady so far this year. And revised data show the core PCE price index to
have decelerated a little over the past year. The overall consumer price index
moved down 0.3 percent in July, reflecting a drop in energy prices, and is up
2.7 percent over the past year.
The CPI for energy fell 5.6 percent in July, bringing the twelve-month change
down to nearly 2 percent. The July energy price decline reflected, most
importantly, a sharp drop in gasoline prices.
Survey evidence indicates that retail gasoline prices began to move higher in the
middle of this month. Still, with gasoline inventories having been rebuilt to
normal levels, margins have declined about 25 cents per gallon since May.
Natural gas inventories have also been rebuilt to levels a bit above seasonal
norms, and prices continued to move lower in July. (Although Hurricane Barry
cut into production of both crude oil and natural gas, the problem does not
appear to have been severe.) Regarding electricity, markets in California have
been surprisingly calm: Wholesale prices are low, and no blackouts have yet
occurred this summer. Nonetheless, a further rate increase will probably be
required to cover the $12.5 billion bond sale scheduled for October.
Consumer food prices rose 0.4 percent in June and 0.3 percent in July. Prices of
fruits and vegetables flattened out in July after a larger-than-average rise in
June, and the price index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs slowed last month.
Excluding these categories, food prices were up 0.4 percent in July, after having
risen 0.3 percent in June. The twelve-month change in the index for all foods
remained above 3 percent in July. Meats and dairy products, both of which
have been affected by supply limitations, have shown particularly large
increases on a year-to-year basis. Prices for these commodities, along with crop
prices, are discussed in more detail in a later section on farm supply
developments.
The modest increase in the CPI excluding food and energy items in July left the
three-month change for this series at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, well below
the spike that occurred early this year. The CPI for core commodities moved up
0.1 percent in July, as a jump in tobacco prices offset declines for apparel and
many durable goods. Over the past twelve months, core goods prices have risen
0.4 percent-the same increase as in the previous twelve-month period. In
contrast, prices for non-energy services have accelerated noticeably over the
past year, and the index for these items rose 0.2 percent further in July. Over
the twelve months ended in July, prices for non-energy services have risen
3.7 percent, about 1/4 percentage point more than in the previous twelve-month

period. The CPIs for owners' equivalent rent and for tenants' rent rose
0.3 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, in July; these indexes have each
accelerated 1 percentage point relative to the preceding year.
Core PCE prices have been rising notably less rapidly than the core CPI and,
indeed, have decelerated a touch over the past year. In June, the twelve-month
change in core PCE prices stood at 1.8 percent, down from 2 percent in the
previous year according to revised NIPA data. (The information in the July CPI
suggests that the twelve-month change in core PCE prices will edge down
further to 1.7 percent in July.) Over the past year, the core PCE price index has
increased about a percentage point less than the core CPI. The gap between
increases in these two price measures has widened markedly since the first half
of the 1990s, when the two registered, on average, the same rate of increase
(measuring the core CPI according to the current-methods series).
Part of the difference between the two measures of core consumer prices is the
result of the inclusion of a variety of items in the PCE measure that are outside
the scope of the CPI. Many of these out-of-scope items do not have market
prices; the BEA relies on a variety of sources and techniques to estimate these
prices, and the resulting figures tend to be quite erratic. These non-market
prices decelerated markedly over the past year and account for most of the
small deceleration in the overall core component of the PCE price index.
Inflation as measured by the market-based components of the core PCE index
has been little changed over the past year.
Prices for capital goods as measured by the producer price index moved up
0.2 percent in July, leaving the twelve-month change at 0.9 percent, about
1/4 percentage point below the year-earlier increase. Prices for computers,
which plummeted in the first quarter, have declined at a moderate pace in the
past few months. In all, computer prices have declined 19 percent over the
twelve months to July, a slightly more rapid pace than the decline over the
previous year.
Turning to broader price indexes, the chain price index for gross domestic
purchases excluding food and energy items rose 1.6 percent over the four
quarters ended in 2001:Q2, down about 1/2 percentage point from the increase
over the previous four quarters. With finished energy prices having decelerated
modestly over this period, a similar easing is evident for overall gross domestic
purchases prices. However, the increase in overall GDP prices over the past
year, at 2.3 percent, was unchanged from the year-earlier figure, held up by a
sharp increase in energy margins earlier this year that was not yet unwound by
the second quarter.

At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate
materials edged down over the twelve months ended in July after having
increased nearly 3 percent over the previous twelve months. And the PPI for
core crude materials continued to move lower in July after dropping sharply
earlier in the year. Indexes of industrial materials prices (such as the
Commodity Research Bureau and Journal of Commerce commodity price
indexes) also generally have moved down since the last Greenbook.
Inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have declined recently. The
median expectation for inflation over the coming year dropped to 2.6 percent in
July after having fluctuated around 3 percent during the first six months of the
year. The mean of these expectations, which in contrast to the median had
moved up notably during the second quarter, fell even more sharply than the
median in July. However, over a five-to-ten year horizon, median expected
inflation edged down just a tenth in July, to 2.9 percent, and has remained little
changed over the past two years.
Labor Costs
Movements over the past couple of years in the two main indicators of labor
costs-the ECI and nonfarm compensation per hour-have been difficult to
reconcile. Nevertheless, both measures suggest that compensation gains might
have crested and are now turning down.
The ECI for hourly compensation in private industry rose 4 percent over the
twelve months ended in June, down from a 4-1/2 percent increase over the
preceding year. Some deceleration occurred both in wages and salaries and in
benefits. Within the benefits component, the year-over-year increases for
nonproduction bonuses, paid leave, and retirement and savings benefits were
smaller.22 In contrast, employer costs for workers' compensation accelerated
noticeably over the past year, and health-insurance costs continued to rise
rapidly.
Nonfarm compensation per hour (CPH) increased at an annual rate of
4-3/4 percent in the second quarter, after having risen at a 5 percent pace in
2001:Q1. Although these gains continued to outpace those measured in the ECI,
they represent a sharp slowing from the extremely rapid rise in CPH now
estimated to have occurred in 2000. These two measures of labor costs differ in
a variety of ways, including the fact that nonfarm compensation per hour
reflects changes in the industry and occupation mix of employment and changes
in overtime hours worked, while the ECI is unaffected by such changes. But
probably the more important difference between these two measures in recent
22. With the exception of health insurance, the benefits detail is unpublished and is provided
to us by the BLS on a confidential basis.

years is that stock options granted as part of compensation are not directly
incorporated in the ECI, while CPH includes the value of such options when
they are exercised. Exercises have increased notably in recent years, which
helps explain part of the faster increases in CPH than in the ECI since 1997, and
we suspect that some of the sharp acceleration in CPH in 2000 reflects a pickup
in option exercises as well.23
To the extent that firms can and do hedge against stock-option risk when the
options are granted, employees' subsequent gains, per se, should not impose
unexpected costs on the firm that would lead to pressure on prices. Rather, the
value of the options at the time they are granted should be viewed as the
increment to labor costs-though neither the ECI nor CPH attempts to measure
the option value of these grants. Stock-option exercises look to have exceeded
grants over the several years through 2000.
Combined with the downward revision to productivity, last year's upward
revision to nonfarm compensation per hour implies that the CPH-based measure
of unit labor costs surged 5 percent after having risen about 2 percent, on
average, in 1998 and 1999. Taken at face value, the upward revision to unit
labor costs, combined with the comparatively minor price revisions, would
imply that firms' price-cost margins have a notably smaller cushion to absorb
further cost increases than was evident in the pre-revision data. Because stock-
option exercises appear to have exceeded grants through 1999-as well as, we
think, in 2000-a more relevant measure of unit labor costs-one that includes
the value of grants but not exercises-may have been increasing a little more
slowly than the published hourly compensation data indicate. Or course, given
the downward revision to productivity, even this adjustment would likely leave
unit labor costs significantly higher on a revised basis than previously
estimated.
The July employment report provided the first look at wage developments in the
third quarter. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers increased 0.3 percent in July and were up 4.4 percent over the
preceding twelve months. In contrast to the ECI for wages and salaries of
workers in production and nonsupervisory occupations, average hourly earnings
have not yet shown signs of deceleration. Although movements in these two
23. The Board staff constructed a series on option exercises from the annual reports of 150
companies since 1996. Unfortunately, the annual reports do not provide information on the
average price at which these options were exercised, leaving a relatively wide range for the value
of these option exercises given the wide range of stock-market prices during each year.

series are similar over long spans of time, over shorter periods significant
differences can emerge.24
Agricultural Developments
The Department of Agriculture's August crop report provided the first detailed
look at how the fall harvest for 2001 is likely to shape up. On the basis of
August 1 conditions, aggregate output of the three major field crops-corn,
wheat, and soybeans-is expected to decline somewhat from last year's level,
which was almost a record high. Cool, damp weather during the spring and hot,
dry weather in some regions in midsummer have combined to trim acreage a bit
and to pull yields a little below earlier forecasts. The USDA is predicting that
aggregate consumption of these crops over the coming year will exceed this
year's production. Consequently, inventories are expected to drop back
somewhat from the high levels of the past three years. Prices of crops have
turned up with the prospective tightening of stocks, but, having fallen
substantially in the latter part of the 1990s, these prices remain to the low side
of the average over the past decade.
The prices received for livestock have also been rising this year, and the
second-quarter average of prices received by farmers for these products was
almost 13 percent above the level of the previous year. This price rise seems to
have been driven to a considerable degree by cutbacks in supply. Production of
meat has trailed year-earlier levels in recent quarters; output of milk also has
fallen. The USDA is forecasting that supplies of livestock products, overall,
will be gradually picking up in coming quarters. Traders in futures markets
apparently concur, as futures prices for livestock show about a third of the rise
of livestock prices over the past year (2000:Q2 to 2001:Q2) will be reversed
over the next four quarters, with declines for hogs and milk more than offsetting
a small year-to-year price rise for cattle.
24. An alternative weighting of average hourly earnings that is similar to the fixed-weighted
ECI suggests that weighting differences cannot explain much of the discrepancy between the two
series.

Appendix
Annual Revision to the National Income and Product Accounts
On July 27, the BEA published its regular annual revision to the national income and
product accounts. The revision, which extended back to 1998, incorporated more
comprehensive source data, including annual Census Bureau surveys of businesses and
of state and local governments, new information from the OMB and USDA, updated
international transactions accounts, unemployment insurance records, and business tax
returns. In addition, the BEA made several methodological changes, including
conversion to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for
estimating some components of GDP, adoption of a new FRB price index that reflects
quality improvements in local area networks for estimating real investment in
communications equipment, and incorporation of new source data for estimating
investment in prepackaged and custom software.
Revisions to GDP and Its Components
From the fourth quarter of 1997 to the first quarter of this year, the average annual rate
of growth in real GDP was revised down 0.3 percentage point, to 3.8 percent. On a
fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, growth was revised up 0.2 percentage point in
1998, and down 0.6 percentage point in both 1999 and 2000. The growth rate in the
first quarter of 2001 was revised up 0.1 percentage point, to 1.3 percent.
About half of the downward revision to real GDP over the three-year period reflected a
slower estimated rate of growth in business investment in software, owing to new
source data from the Census Bureau's annual surveys of service-producing firms.1 In
addition, personal consumption expenditures are shown in the revised data as having
increased at a slightly less robust average pace-4.7 percent over the past three years
compared with 4.9 percent in the previous estimates. In contrast, the revised data
showed a considerably stronger pace of residential investment.
Income-Side Developments
The level of gross domestic income was revised down in the first quarter of 2001, but
by less than GDP. Thus, the previously large gap between these measures (the
statistical discrepancy) widened further.
Shifts in the composition of income were sizable. Labor compensation was revised up
considerably, largely on the basis of wage and salary data from unemployment
insurance records (as the BEA had announced earlier in the spring), while corporate
profits were revised down on the basis of information from tax returns. In the first
quarter of this year, economic profits excluding Federal Reserve banks amounted to
7.5 percent of gross national product, down from a previous estimate of 8.2 percent.
The higher level of wage and salary disbursements showed through to higher personal
income (despite a fair-sized downward revision to personal interest income).
1. To guard against such large revisions in the future, the BEA has begun using data on

Disposable income was also revised up, and, with the downward revision to PCE, the
personal saving rate in the first quarter of 2001 was measured to be 1.1 percent-
2.1 percentage points above the previous estimate.
Compensation and Prices
Nonfarm business compensation per hour is now estimated to have increased faster, on
net, over the revision period, reflecting a substantially more rapid rise in hourly
compensation in 2000 than had been previously estimated. Meanwhile, four-quarter
percent changes in core PCE prices were essentially unrevised in 1998 and 1999 but
were revised up 0.3 percentage point in 2000. Last year, the upward revisions were
concentrated in the non-market-based components of PCE prices, especially brokerage
services.
The BLS's Annual Revisions to Productivity
On August 7, the BLS released updated estimates of productivity, which incorporated
the new GDP data as well as the annual benchmark revision to the payroll employment
survey released in June. According to the new figures, output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector rose at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent between the fourth quarter of
1997 and the first quarter of this year, about 1/2 percentage point slower than
previously shown. Most of the downward revision reflected slower output growth in
1999 and 2000. Still, the revised data indicate a considerably faster pace of
productivity growth in the past three years compared with the 1-1/2 percent growth rate
experienced, on average, between 1974 and 1994.

Domestic Financial Developments
Policy Expectations, Interest Rates, and Stock Prices
Market participants built in a higher path for the federal funds rate immediately
following the June FOMC meeting, but then proceeded to move it lower.
Futures quotes increased initially in response to the smaller-than-expected
quarter-point easing and the release of the minutes from the May meeting that
noted a growing concern among some Committee members about the risks of
inflation. However, this increase was more than rolled back by the generally
weak cast to news on the economy and the Chairman's monetary policy
testimony in mid-July, which many viewed to be emphasizing downside risks to
the economy.
On net, the expected path of the funds rate has shifted down about 10 basis
points a few months out to as much as 50 basis points in 2002. Current futures
market quotes suggest that investors are confident of a quarter-point easing at
the August meeting and place some odds on a larger move. Moreover, the
trough in the expected funds rate has been lowered and pushed out from the
fourth quarter of this year to early next year, suggesting a more pessimistic
assessment of the prospects that the recovery in economic growth will take hold
in coming months.
Weak second-quarter corporate earnings and the sizable downward revisions to
analysts' earnings projections for the second half of this year weighed on equity
markets over the period. Broad stock market indexes were down about
3 percent, with technology shares pulling the Nasdaq down about 7 percent.
The less sanguine economic outlook spurred declines in Treasury coupon yields,
with the fall most pronounced at shorter maturities. Investment-grade bond
yields fell about in line with comparable Treasury yields, leaving risk spreads
little changed on balance. Major speculative-grade bond indexes posted larger
declines, but some of those declines are due to changes in the composition of the
indexes.1
Business borrowing appears to have remained weak in July, as firms have
greatly restrained spending programs in the current economic environment and
lenders have remained cautious. In the most recent survey of bank lending
practices, a substantial fraction of bank loan officers reported that they
continued to tighten standards and terms on loans to businesses over the past
three months though less than in previous surveys.
1. About 50 of the 67 basis point decline in the ML175 index is due to a change in the
composition of bonds in the index. In particular, a number of newly issued bonds that carried
lower risk premiums were added to the index.

III-3
Both mortgage borrowing and consumer credit growth slowed in the second
quarter. Although the household debt-service burden ticked down in the second
quarter, it remains close to its mid-1980s peak, suggesting that households
continue to feel payment strains.
Business Finance
Reports from the vast majority of S&P 500 firms indicate that second-quarter
operating earnings per share fell about 21 percent from the year-earlier level, the
largest decline in more than a decade.2 However, the stock market remained
fairly resilient in the face of the weak earnings reports, which appear to have
been largely anticipated by market participants. While equity analysts continue
to expect earnings to recover in the second half, they have revised down
substantially the extent of the projected rebound. Looking further ahead,
expectations for five-year earnings growth rates have also been marked down,
most notably for technology firms.
With share prices languishing, funds raised in public equity markets by domestic
nonfinancial firms-which had jumped in June-plummeted in July to the
lowest monthly total so far this year. Issuance thus far in August has been
minimal, and market sentiment toward new public issues by technology firms
remains very cool. Moreover, venture capital financing fell further in the
second quarter and is down about 60 percent from the level in the fourth quarter
of last year.
At the same time, equity retirements by domestic corporations have continued to
moderate. Announcements of share repurchase programs fell in the second
quarter to the slowest pace since 1994, and announcements continued to be few
and far between in July, as firms apparently have been trying to conserve cash.
Retirements from domestic cash-financed mergers fell in the second quarter to
just over one-third of the rate recorded last year and slackened further in July.
Merger announcements have also thinned.
The volume of borrowing by nonfinancial firms has dropped off appreciably
over the past couple of months. This slowdown appears to reflect both
weakness in capital expenditures and the reduced level of cash-financed merger
activity. Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations, which posted a record
high of $67 billion in May, slowed to an average of $29 billion in June and July,
only partly owing to a lessening in the pace of debt restructuring from earlier in
the year when corporations took advantage of attractive rates to issue long-term
debt and pay down bank loans and commercial paper. C&I loans declined
2. This figure for operating earnings excludes most one-time charges. The second quarter
saw a significant number of large charges for restructuring and write-downs of goodwill that led
to some outsized "top-line" losses.

sharply in June and continued to contract at a somewhat slower pace in July. In
this regard, about half of domestic banks in the August survey of lending
practices reported weaker demand for C&I loans over the past three months.
Domestic nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding continued to contract over
both months, although the runoff slowed in July, and quality spreads have
returned to a normal range, as a number of issuers that fell from favor have
withdrawn from the market. Available data indicate that the major components
of business borrowing, including bonds, bank loans, and commercial paper,
continued to be weak in early August.
Incoming data suggest that corporate credit quality has continued to deteriorate,
but probably at a slower rate than in prior months. Business failures slowed in
June and July, albeit to a level that is still well above last year's pace. Debt
downgrades continued to outpace upgrades in June and July, but by less than
earlier in the year. Moody's downgraded, on net, an average of $20 billion per
month in June and July, compared with an average net monthly downgrade of
$57 billion over the first five months of the year. The default rate on junk bonds
rose in July to over 12 percent and, based on recent forward-looking indicators,
should remain near this elevated level in the year ahead. Junk bond spreads
remain at a high level and are higher than predictions based on the historical
relationship between spreads and expected default rates. Although bank loan
officers surveyed in August continued to tighten terms and standards for
business borrowers, the fraction that tightened fell relative to earlier in the year.
Banks reporting tighter terms and standards cited a less favorable economic
outlook as well as concern about rising defaults among below-investment-grade
borrowers. Loan officers also noted a decidedly more stringent posture in their
lending to firms in the high-tech sector.
Growth in commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have slowed to about a
7 percent pace in the second quarter. However, the market for commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remains fairly strong, with relatively stable
interest rate spreads and large volumes of issuance. At $17-1/4 billion, gross
issuance in the second quarter was high relative to the past two or three years,
and issuance for the third quarter to date is on track to match or surpass the
second-quarter pace. On balance, available data indicate a modest deterioration
in commercial real estate credit quality in the second quarter. While
delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by life insurance companies
and those backing CMBS remained relatively low in the second quarter, office
vacancy rates increased noticeably over the first half of 2001. Perhaps
reflecting eroding prospects in this sector, more than 40 percent of domestic
banks tightened standards on commercial real estate loans in the August loan
officer survey, about the same as in the May survey.

III-9
Household Finance
Rates on fixed-rate mortgages have edged down to just below 7 percent since
the last FOMC meeting. Despite low mortgage rates and the tendency of
homeowners to take some cash out when refinancing, mortgage debt growth in
the second quarter looks to have been slower than in the first, as new residential
construction cooled. Consumer credit growth also moderated in the second
quarter, consistent with slower growth in household spending on durable goods.
Survey evidence suggests that only a small percentage of domestic banks, on
net, tightened terms or standards on household mortgage and consumer loans
over the summer months. Total household debt is estimated to have increased at
a 6 percent pace in the second quarter, down from nearly 8 percent recorded in
the first quarter.
Slower household debt growth, combined with lower interest rates, contributed
to a tick down in the debt-service burden in the second quarter.3 Still, the
debt-service burden remains relatively high, which appears to be taking its toll
on household credit quality. The delinquency rate for credit cards in securitized
pools reached a three-year high in June, while the delinquency rate for auto
loans at captive finance companies edged up for the second month in a row.
The ratio of household assets to disposable income moved up slightly in the
second quarter, owing mainly to higher stock market values. Households
increased their net purchases of equity mutual funds in the second quarter, but
net flows slackened toward the end of the quarter when the stock market turned
down. Flows into equity mutual funds continued to weaken in July, while flows
into domestic, investment-grade bond funds strengthened. The equity share of
new contributions to 401(k) pension plans declined in June and July, and
transfer activity waned, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty about the
market.
Treasury Finance
The Treasury announced that it expects to borrow $51 billion in marketable debt
in the third quarter, a sizable revision from the $57 billion paydown that it had
expected as recently as the end of April. However, about a third of this
increased borrowing merely reflects the shift of the corporate tax due date from
September 15 to October 1, which will reduce fourth-quarter borrowing needs
by an equal amount; the rest of the upward revision is attributable in roughly
equal parts to the tax cut and to a shortfall in receipts relative to expectations.
3. The upward revisions by BEA to disposable personal income pulled down the
debt-service burden over the past three years, which now stands about 1/4 percentage point
below its mid-1980s peak.

III-13
The Treasury has begun to conduct weekly auctions of four-week bills, which
are intended to help it better manage fluctuations in its cash balances and reduce
its reliance on cash management bills. With the introduction of the four-week
bill, weekly offerings of all bills reached nearly $40 billion-well above their
historical range. The heavy supply, along with the prospect that issuance will
remain elevated because of smaller surpluses, has apparently weighed on bill
prices. Yield spreads on both three-month commercial paper and eurodollar
deposits over the three-month Treasury bill have reached unusually low levels.
Agency and GSE Finance
Over the intermeeting period, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to issue
sizable volumes of benchmark securities and to conduct limited buybacks of
benchmark securities as a means of tailoring their liabilities to the duration of
their asset portfolios. Yields on GSE benchmark notes and bonds, as well as
comparable swap rates, fell by about the same amount as Treasury yields over
the intermeeting period. At shorter maturities, the GSEs' bill programs did not
seem to suffer much from the additional supplies associated with the Treasury's
new four-week bill program.
State and Local Government Finance
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities totaled about $29 billion in June,
including just over $9 billion of securities to refund outstanding debt. However,
gross issuance of long-term bonds dropped in July, pulled down by a sharp
decline in refunding activity. The pace of refundings has likely cooled because
many governments have already taken advantage of the decline in long-term
yields since the second half of last year.
The situation in California has improved of late, as energy prices edged down in
early summer and remain lower than originally projected. California has been
taken off watch lists by S&P and Moody's and is moving forward with its plan
to issue a $12-1/2 billion bond later this year.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth of M2 slowed somewhat in July to an 8-1/2 percent pace after
expanding at a 10-1/2 percent rate in the first half of the year. Liquid deposits
and retail money funds continued to expand briskly while small time deposits
ran off, reflecting the typical responses to declines in short-term interest rates.
In addition, M2 may have been bolstered by increased foreign demand for U.S.
currency as well as households' more cautious attitude toward investing in the
stock market. The staff estimates that tax rebates, proceeding at $3-1/2 billion
per week since the latter part of July, did not have much effect on M2 growth in
July, but they are expected to add 2 to 4 percentage points to M2 growth in
August and September.

Bank credit edged up in July after a decline in June, as growth in securities more
than offset the continued falloff in loans. Business loans, which have been
declining since March, fell sharply in June and July. The growth of consumer
loans and residential real estate loans in June and July was well below the pace
in the first half of the year.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The August 2001 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. The survey included supplementary questions
on the exposure of banks to firms in the high-technology sector and the degree to which
credit standards and loan terms were tightened in that sector over the past year. Loan
officers from fifty-seven large domestic banks and nineteen U.S. branches and agencies
of foreign banks participated in the survey.
Although the number of domestic and foreign banking institutions that reported
tightening standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the past
three months remained elevated, it was lower than earlier in the year. A significant
fraction of domestic institutions also tightened standards for commercial real estate
loans in the August survey. In general, banks that tightened standards and terms on
C&I loans indicated that the most important reasons for tightening were a less favorable
or more uncertain economic outlook and a worsening of industry-specific problems.
Almost half of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for C&I loans over the
past three months, about the same proportion as in the May survey. A somewhat larger
net fraction than in May reported that demand for commercial real estate loans had
waned.
Domestic banks reported that only about 6 percent of C&I loans on their books were
made to high-technology companies, indicating that their exposure to these firms is
quite limited. By contrast, branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that loans
to high-technology companies accounted for about 13 percent of their C&I loan
portfolio. Domestic as well as foreign respondents noted that their tightening of credit
standards and loan terms over the past year for tech firms was greater than that for
similarly rated firms in other sectors (see the section below on lending to the high-tech
sector for the definition of the sector used by the survey).
Compared with the January and May surveys, smaller net fractions of domestic banks
tightened standards and increased spreads over their cost of funds for all types of
consumer loans over the past three months. According to the domestic respondents,
demand for consumer loans was about unchanged in August. Nearly all domestic banks
kept their standards for residential mortgage loans unchanged over the past three
months. About one-fourth of the respondents, on net, noted that demand for residential
mortgages had strengthened during the survey period, down from almost one-half in the
May survey.
Lending to Businesses
Although banks again reported that they tightened standards on C&I loans over the past
three months, the fractions of domestic and foreign respondents that reported doing so
retreated for the second consecutive survey. The percentage of domestic banks that
reported tightening their standards on loans to large and middle-market firms-which
peaked at 60 percent in the January survey and decreased to about 50 percent in the
May survey-fell to 40 percent in August. Lending standards on business loans to
small firms followed a similar pattern: 32 percent of domestic banks reported tightening

III-A-2
standards over the past three months, down from 36 percent in May and 45 percent in
January. The fraction of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported
tightening standards for customers seeking C&I loans fell from two-thirds in May to
one-half in the August survey.
In the August survey, the net fractions of domestic banks that reported tightening each
of the loan terms listed in the survey were similar to the net fractions in May. More
than half of the domestic respondents reported charging higher premiums on riskier
loans to large and middle-market firms; as has been the case for several surveys, no
bank reported lowering these premiums. More than half of the domestic banks, on net,
indicated that they had increased spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for large
and middle-market firms over the past three months. Almost half, on net, also increased
fees on credit lines for these borrowers. Somewhat smaller net fractions of domestic
respondents tightened terms on C&I loans to small firms.
More than 60 percent of the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported
charging higher premiums on riskier loans, and nearly the same fraction increased the
fees associated with credit lines. More than half of the foreign institutions also noted
that they had increased spreads and tightened loan covenants over the past three
months.
Most of the domestic and foreign respondents that had tightened standards or terms on
C&I loans over the previous three months continued to cite a less favorable or more
uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, and a reduced
tolerance for risk as the most important reasons for changing their lending policies. In
responses that were consistent with the elevated default rate on junk bonds, 52 percent
of domestic banks and 87 percent of foreign institutions that had tightened commercial
lending policies also mentioned an increase in defaults by below-investment-grade
borrowers as a contributing reason.
More than one-half of the domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for C&I
loans from large and middle-market firms, up from 40 percent in May, and more than
one-third, on net, reported decreased demand from small firms. Most of the domestic
banks that reported weaker loan demand cited reduced customer needs to finance
capital expenditures and mergers and acquisitions. About two-thirds of domestic banks
also mentioned lower demand for inventory financing, a result that is consistent with
the ongoing inventory correction. On net, 21 percent of foreign branches and agencies
saw weaker loan demand over the past three months, compared with 10 percent, on net,
in the May survey.
More than 40 percent of domestic banks tightened standards on commercial real estate
loans over the past three months, about the same as in the May survey. One-fifth of
foreign institutions that engage in commercial real estate lending also tightened
standards in the current survey. On net, 32 percent of domestic and 10 percent of
foreign institutions reported lower demand for commercial real estate loans over the
past three months.
Lending to the High-Technology Sector
The current survey also included a series of special questions that addressed lending to

III-A-3
high-technology firms over the past year. The survey defined the high-technology (or
"tech") sector as consisting of the following five high-technology industries: (1)
telecommunications service providers, (2) telecommunications equipment
manufacturers, (3) intemet commerce, (4) semiconductor manufacturers, and (5)
computer hardware, software, and other high-tech industries.
Less than 6 percent, on average, of the volume of C&I loans on the books of domestic
banks that responded to the questions was made to the firms in the high-technology
sector; thus banks' exposures to this troubled sector appear to be limited.' More than
one-third of these technology loans were made to telecommunications service
providers, with the second highest area of concentration in the computer hardware,
software, and other high-tech sectors group. Foreign institutions reported that about
13 percent of their outstanding C&I loans were accounted for by technology companies,
of which telecommunications service providers represented about 40 percent.
Domestic and foreign institutions tightened credit standards for C&I loans to
technology companies more aggressively than for loans outside the high-tech sector
over the past year. The constriction of credit supply conditions was particularly severe
for below-investment-grade high-tech firms: 25 percent of domestic banks reported that
they had tightened standards somewhat more and 44 percent indicated that they had
tightened standards considerably more for C&I loans to lower-rated tech borrowers
relative to their non-tech counterparts. For foreign respondents, those fractions were 24
percent and 71 percent, respectively.
In addition, domestic and foreign banks reportedly tightened terms on loans to high-
technology companies more aggressively than they had on loans to non-tech firms over
the past year. About 50 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had increased
price-related terms (such as fees and spreads) for investment-grade technology
companies by more than they had for investment-grade non-tech firms. A greater
number of domestic respondents, 72 percent, reported that they had toughened these
terms for below-investment-grade tech firms relative to similarly rated firms in other
sectors, a result consistent with the already elevated level of spreads and fees for below-
investment-grade technology firms as of one year ago. This pattern of relative
tightening was similar for non-price-related terms (such as loan covenants) at domestic
banks and for both types of terms at branches and agencies of foreign banks.
Lending to Households
Over the past three months, domestic banks' credit standards for approving residential
mortgage loans were largely unchanged. About one-fourth of the respondents, on net,
reported that demand for residential mortgages increased over the past three months.
About 10 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported that they had tightened standards
on credit card and other consumer loans over the survey period, down from 20 percent
and 18 percent, respectively, in May. In addition, more than 10 percent of respondents
increased the minimum required credit score for both categories of consumer loans. For
consumer loans other than credit cards, 14 percent of domestic institutions, on net,
1. Two prominent large banks and one smaller bank declined to answer the question.

III-A-4
increased spreads over their cost of funds, down from about one-fourth in the previous
survey, but only a few banks increased spreads on credit card loans in August. On net,
5 percent of banks reported stronger demand for consumer loans over the past three
months.

Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed to $28.3 billion in May
from $32.0 billion in April (revised). For April and May combined, the trade
deficit was $362 billion at an annual rate, $18 billion smaller than in the first
quarter.

The value of exports increased about 1 percent in May, following sharp declines
in both March and April. For April and May combined, the value of exports fell
11 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter level, following a smaller
decrease in the first quarter. Almost all of the April-May decline was in
exported capital goods (mainly computers, semiconductors, and other
machinery) and industrial supplies. There were small increases in exports of
automotive products to Canada and consumer goods.
The value of imports plummeted 2.4 percent in May, following a similarly sized
decline in April. All major categories of imports fell, excluding oil, which was
about unchanged. For April and May combined, the value of imports fell
13 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter level, roughly double the rate
of decrease in the first quarter. While much of the decline was in computers,
semiconductors, and other machinery, imports in nearly all other major trade
categories decreased as well. Imports of automotive products, however, moved
up somewhat, primarily from Canada and Mexico in response rising U.S. vehicle
sales.
Data for U.S. trade in June will be released on August 17 and will be reported in
the Greenbook supplement.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil dropped sharply in July, following declines
in both the first and second quarters. After the United Nations postponed
attempts to overhaul sanctions in early July, Iraq resumed oil exports, and the
spot price of West Texas Intermediate fell below $25 per barrel. Other factors
also put downward pressure on oil prices-increased levels of oil inventories and
increasing signs of weak global demand. In response to these pressures, OPEC
agreed in late July to cut production targets 1 million barrels per day beginning
in September, and the spot price of WTI moved back up to near $28 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil (and core) goods dropped 1 percent
(not an annual rate) in July. While prices of all major categories declined, the
largest decrease was in industrial supplies. There was a sharp drop in the price
of imported natural gas and smaller price declines for lumber, chemicals,
unfinished metals, and paper. July was the sixth consecutive month of decline
for prices of non-oil (and core) imports. In the second quarter, non-oil import
prices (NIPA accounts) fell 5.2 percent at an annual rate (core goods by 4.4
percent), similarly led by declines in prices of imported industrial supplies.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports (total and core) decreased 0.4 percent in
July, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. Prices of computers and
semiconductors dropped once again. The decline in prices of core goods was
largely from industrial supplies (petroleum, chemicals, and metals) and other
machinery. In the second quarter, prices of exported core goods (NIPA
accounts) decreased marginally, 0.7 percent at an annual rate, as declines in
prices of industrial supplies and agricultural products were offset by increases in
prices of machinery.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
During the second quarter, foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4
of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) continued at an annual
rate well above last year's record level. Net purchases of both corporate and
agency bonds were very high in the second quarter. Foreign net acquisitions of
corporate bonds, associated with a surge in corporate issuance in the first six
months of the year, exceeded the record level set in the prior quarter. Net
acquisitions of agency bonds, while slightly down from the first quarter, are still
on pace to easily exceed last year's record net purchases. The slide in U.S.
equity prices may finally be having some effect on foreign purchases, as foreign
net acquisitions of equities fell in the second quarter and for the year are well
below last year's level. Foreign holdings of Treasuries were essentially
unchanged for the second consecutive quarter, altering the trend of fairly large
net sales.

IV-6
U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) were higher in the second
quarter than in recent quarters, due in large part to stock swaps, with some $22
billion accounted for by the purchase of Voicestream Wireless by Deutsche
Telekom in June. However, net acquisitions of foreign equities exclusive of
stock swaps were also relatively high in the first two quarters of this year. U.S.
investors appear to have reacquired their appetite for Japanese equities,
purchasing $7 billion and $10 billion in the first two quarters, respectively, after
being net sellers in 2000.
Measured foreign official assets held in the United States (line 1) fell by $33
billion in the quarter, with the largest decreases recorded by China ($19 billion)
and Japan ($8 billion), while net gains were recorded by Argentina ($4 billion)
and Russia ($3 billion). The Chinese official outflow is likely overstated,
however: in the past many Chinese official inflows appear to have been recorded
instead as private inflows in the transactions data', and Chinese private inflows
for the quarter were measured at $13 billion -a huge sum relative to estimated
private holdings. There were no reported foreign exchange market interventions
by Japan. Partial data from the FRBNY show that between end-June and early-
August total foreign official holdings were virtually unchanged and Japanese
foreign official holdings fell an additional $4 billion.
The U.S. banking sector (line 3) recorded a modest net inflow of $6 billion in
the second quarter. Of note are significant revisions to the first quarter banking
sector data, where an originally-reported outflow of $108 billion that was used
by the BEA to compute the first quarter balance of payments position has been
reduced to an outflow of $51 billion.
1. The nearly-completed March 2000 benchmark survey of foreign holdings of U.S. long-
term securities shows both that Chinese private holdings of U.S. securities were much lower than
indicated by the transactions data and that Chinese official holdings were much higher. We
suspect that securities purchased by government entities not classified as official (Ministry of
Finance and Central Bank) are being transferred to the official sector in a manner that is not
captured in the TIC reporting system.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the major currencies index of the trade-weighted exchange value of
the dollar declined 2-3/4 percent over the intermeeting period, with much of this
change occurring in recent days. Indications that the current period of slow-
paced U.S. economic activity will continue longer than had previously been
anticipated appeared to outweigh reports that economic activity is slowing in
other industrial countries as well. The index of the dollar's value against the
currencies of our other important trading partners declined fractionally over the
intermeeting period.

The dollar appreciated moderately against the euro in early July as market
participants speculated that the European Central Bank, appearing constrained
by relatively high inflation rates in the euro-area countries, would not ease its
policy stance in the near term. Subsequent reports that inflationary pressures
were easing somewhat in these countries helped renew speculation that the ECB,
too, may decide to lower interest rates later this year. The advance estimate of
U.S. second-quarter GDP growth apparently disappointed market participants
and contributed to a change in market sentiment away from dollar-denominated
assets. On balance, the dollar depreciated 5% percent against the euro over the
period. While euro-denominated short-term interest rates and government bond
yields declined slightly on net, euro-area share prices retreated 6 percent.

The dollar also depreciated 2 percent against sterling. The Bank of England
surprised market participants by lowering its target policy interest rate on
August 2, stating that its outlook for aggregate demand and output growth had
become weaker than previously projected. The dollar appreciated about
1 percent against the Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada, citing a slower pace
of economic growth and reduced pressures on productive capacity and inflation,
also eased its policy, lowering target rates 25 basis points on July 17. The move
had been widely anticipated by market participants and elicited few market
reactions. Largely reflecting the policy actions by the respective central banks,
Canadian dollar and sterling short-term rates declined almost 30 basis points
over the period.
The dollar strengthened against the yen during much of the intermeeting period,
but depreciated abruptly late in the period, ending 3-1/4 percent weaker than at the
June FOMC meeting. The comfortable victory of the LDP-led coalition in the
Upper-House elections in late July appeared to strengthen Prime Minister
Koizumi's mandate to introduce extensive structural changes to the Japanese
economy. However, a worsening near-term outlook for Japanese economic
activity-share prices dropped more than 11 percent on balance over the period-
raised concerns that the Japanese government will need implement a
supplemental budget and further worsen its fiscal imbalance (relative to earlier

IV-10
projections). This, in turn, contributed to a run-up of 15 basis points in the yield
of the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond; short-term rates remained
near the zero-floor.

Argentina's worsening economic crisis and the government's apparent inability
to put its financing on a sustainable path led to a drastic increase in the yield
spread of Argentine sovereign debt over U.S. Treasuries, an accelerated pace of
withdrawal of currency from the Argentine banking system, a drop of almost
25 percent in share prices, and widespread pessimism about the country's ability
to stave off a sovereign default and a collapse of its currency-board monetary
regime. Late in the period, speculation that the IMF and other multilateral
organizations may extend additional financial support to shore up foreign
currency reserves led to a slight reduction in Argentine sovereign yield spreads.

IV-11
Spillovers from Argentina's problems to other emerging markets over the period
were largely limited to Brazil, which saw the exchange value of its currency fall
7 percent against the dollar and its EMBI+ spread widen 80 basis points. A new
$15 billion standby agreement reached with the IMF on August 3 helped restore
a measure of investor confidence and stabilize financial market prices in Brazil.
Financial markets in Mexico were only slightly affected by the turmoil in
Argentine financial markets. The earnings outlook for many companies located
in East Asia suffered from the global slump in demand for high-tech sector
products, and their share prices declined broadly. The removal from office of
President Wahid of Indonesia in mid-July and the attendant non-violent
resolution of long-simmering political uncertainty contributed to a 30 percent
rally of the rupiah's exchange value against the dollar over the intermeeting
period, but did not appear to provide a boost to prices of Indonesian financial
assets.
The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or
Treasury.

IV-12
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Recent indicators for the foreign industrial economies suggest that activity
weakened further in the second quarter. In Japan, incoming data are consistent
with the economy having contracted in the second quarter, with a slump in
domestic activity being exacerbated by slowing global demand. The
deteriorating external environment has also contributed to further downward
momentum in the euro area, where output in the manufacturing sector has fallen
significantly in recent months, and in the United Kingdom, where real GDP is
estimated to have grown only 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter.
Growth also remains sluggish in Canada, although consumer confidence and
industrial production both rebounded somewhat in the second quarter.
With oil prices down from last year's highs, consumer price inflation has begun
to ease in recent months. The Canadian twelve-month rate of consumer price
inflation dropped from 3.9 percent in May to 3.3 percent in June. In the euro
area, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation moved down to 3
percent in June but still remained above the European Central Bank's 2 percent
ceiling. Deflationary pressures in Japan have intensified recently, as the impact
of higher oil prices there has begun to diminish.
With global growth slowing more than expected, the Bank of England surprised
markets, lowering policy rates 25 basis points in August, and has now lowered
rates 100 basis points since January. The Bank of Japan also surprised markets
by voting to ease monetary policy in August, raising the target for banks'
reserves held at the central bank and announcing an intention to increase their
purchases of government bonds. The Bank of Canada lowered policy rates 25
basis points in July, bringing rates down a total of 150 basis points so far this
year.
Recent indicators for Japan suggest that the economy contracted in the second
quarter, after expanding slightly (according to recently revised data) in the first
quarter. Industrial production dropped 3.9 percent in the second quarter, led by
a steep decline in production of electrical machinery, a category that includes
high-tech equipment. The broader all-industry index, a supply-side proxy for
GDP, was nearly 2 percent below its first-quarter level on average in April and
May. On the demand side, shipments of machinery also registered a sharp drop
in the second quarter, while machinery orders, a leading indicator of business
investment, tumbled in May and June, dragged down by a plunge in orders for
electrical machinery. Both residential and nonresidential building starts fell in
the second quarter. Household spending also weakened further, with household
expenditures falling roughly 3 percent in the second quarter, and new passenger
car registrations rising only modestly over the same period.

IV-13
The job market continued to soften. Employment fell in June for the fourth
consecutive month to a level about 1-1/2 percent below its recent peak in
November of last year, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent, a
record high. The job-offers-to-applicants ratio remained unchanged at 0.61 in
June, after declining steadily this year from its recent peak of 0.66 in December.
Prices continued to decline. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 0.9 percent in July
from a year earlier. Deflation in wholesale prices for domestic goods has
intensified, as the impact of the earlier run-up in energy prices has faded. Land
prices also have continued to fall, with prices down 5 percent on average in
January 2001 from a year earlier. This marked the tenth consecutive year of
declining prices for both residential and commercial property.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) averaged $59 billion at
an annual rate in the first six months of this year, about half the level in the same
period in 2000. The declining trend in the surplus reflects the impact of higher
oil prices as well as slowing global demand.
The Bank of Japan's closely-watched Tankan index of business conditions
slipped further in June, with the deterioration largely concentrated in the
manufacturing sector. Survey respondents also project a slight further decline in
the index for September. Other indicators from the Tankan suggest that
deflationary conditions are expected to persist. There was a decline in the
number of firms that see "excess demand" for their products versus those that
see "excess supply." Indicators of excessive inventory levels rose, and the
number of firms that expect input and output prices to fall increased.
Expectations for growth in sales and profits were downgraded significantly for
this fiscal year. Capital investment is expected to fall about 6 percent in
FY2001 after declining nearly 1 percent in FY2000.
On August 14, the Bank of Japan voted to ease monetary policy, raising its
target for the outstanding balance of bank accounts held at the BOJ from 5
trillion yen to around 6 trillion yen. As part of this effort to ease policy, the BOJ
will increase the monthly amount of outright purchases of long-term JGBs from
the current 400 billion yen to 600 billion yen. The BOJ cited the worsening
economy, which it blamed primarily on a fall in exports, in justifying this
decision. The Bank also indicated that the easing measures are intended to
provide maximum support for reform efforts that "have started to take place
under the strong leadership of the government." This may be a reference to
Prime Minister Koizumi's FY2002 budget guidelines, approved by the Cabinet
on August 10, which call for steep cuts in public works and foreign aid

IV-14
expenditures. It is not clear, though, whether the intended cuts will in fact
survive the budget process, which will not be completed until next April.

In late July, Japan's ruling LDP secured its largest Upper House election win
since 1992. Although Prime Minister Koizumi's overwhelming popularity was
the driving force behind the LDP's successful showing, suggesting a strong
popular mandate for reform, the actual prospects for reform are still unclear.
With a stronger LDP there is a risk that the old guard will become more resistant
to reform, particularly given continued deterioration in recent economic data. In
addition, despite evidence of widespread public support for structural reform, it
is not clear how deep that support will be if the reforms result in a significant
rise in unemployment.
Recent data confirm that economic activity in the euro area slowed significantly
in the second quarter and suggest continued weakness in the current quarter.

IV-15
Industrial production declined in both April and May and was likely down
roughly 1 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter overall, based on June data for
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. The euro-area purchasing
managers' surveys for the manufacturing sector moved down further in July,
remaining below the threshold that indicates a contraction in manufacturing.
Service sector purchasing managers' surveys edged up in July and continue to
indicate expansion of activity, but at a slower pace than earlier this year. Euro-
area industrial confidence declined further in July, largely reflecting more
negative opinions on orders. Although consumer confidence remains above its
long-run average, it has also declined for the last three months, largely reflecting
increasing concerns over job prospects.
In its August monthly report, the Bundesbank reported that real GDP in
Germany was likely to have remained unchanged in the second quarter,
according to initial estimates. German manufacturing activity has been
especially weak in the second quarter, as industrial production declined
2.1 percent (s.a.), the largest quarterly decline since 1993. In Italy, preliminary
data indicate that real GDP fell 0.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole have yet to show much
deterioration, as the harmonized unemployment rate has been unchanged at
8.3 percent from April through June. Based on national statistics, however, the
French unemployment rate edged up to 8.8 percent in June. In Germany, the
unemployment rate has been unchanged at 9.3 percent for the first half of this
year, but the number of unemployed has increased over this period, reversing
gains made in the second half of last year.
Consumer price data suggest that inflation is beginning to ease a bit in the euro
area. Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in June from the previous
month and the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation in the euro area
moved down to 3.0 percent, but remained above the European Central Bank's
2 percent target ceiling for the thirteenth consecutive month. The twelve-month
rate of core inflation (which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices)
was unchanged at 2.1 percent in June. Preliminary data for Germany, Italy, and
France suggest that inflation moved down further in July. Producer price
inflation also continues to ease; producer prices rose 3.5 percent in the euro area
in the twelve months to June, the smallest increase since late 1999.

Economic growth in the United Kingdom slowed further in the second quarter,
as preliminary data indicated that real GDP growth rose only 1.2 percent
(s.a.a.r.). Output from manufacturing industries fell again in the second quarter,
while service sector growth slowed. However, retail sales continued to show
strong gains.
Very limited indicators for the third quarter paint a mixed picture. Consumer
confidence moved up in July to its highest level in over a year, and retail sales
rose 0.6 percent (s.a.). Business confidence also increased in July, but the
outlook for expected future production in the manufacturing sector remains

IV-17
pessimistic, and more recent surveys of the service sector are consistent with
growth slowing in the third quarter.
Notwithstanding the recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate remained at 3.2 percent in
July, the lowest rate in 26 years, while the labor force survey measure of the
unemployment rate remained at a record low of 5 percent for the three months
centered in May. Average earnings growth in June ticked above the 4-1/2 percent
rate (from year earlier) that the Bank of England believes to be compatible with
its inflation target, pushed up by mid-year bonuses. The twelve-month rate of
retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) fell slightly in July.

At its August 2, 2001 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of
England voted to lower the official repo rate 25 basis points to 5 percent. The
repo rate has been cut 100 basis points since the beginning of this year. In its
August Inflation Report, the Bank indicated that the effects of the global

IV-18
slowdown and subdued investment should keep growth below trend through
2002.
In Canada, indicators for the second quarter suggest that economic growth has
continued to slow. Real GDP at factor cost on average in April and May was
0.2 percent above the first quarter level, down from average quarterly growth of
0.9 percent in 2000. Growth of housing starts slowed in the second quarter and
turned negative in July, suggesting that construction activity has cooled.
Employment declined in June and July, and a slide in the help-wanted index
suggests further weakening in labor market conditions. Concerns about
employment prospects, however, do not appear to have seriously hurt household
spending; retail sales have continued to grow at a solid pace. In addition,
consumer confidence has shown some resilience, rebounding in the second
quarter from a large decline in the first quarter. Similarly, surveys of investment
plans show a rebound from the low levels seen earlier in the year.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation dropped back to 3.3 percent
in June as the influence of energy prices eased, but remained well above the
ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target range for the third
consecutive month. The twelve-month core rate of inflation (which excludes
food and energy prices) held steady at a more moderate 2.1 percent.
The Bank of Canada has lowered its policy rate, the Bank Rate, a total of 150
basis points this year, most recently by 25 basis points on July 17. The Bank
Rate now stands at 4.5 percent. In its July 17 statement, the Bank indicated that
the slower pace of economic growth in Canada has eased pressures on
production capacity and should, along with a moderation in energy prices,
contribute to a reduction in Canadian inflation in the second half of this year.
The Bank's next policy announcement date is August 28.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In the major developing countries, with a notable exception of China, the overall
pace of economic growth continued to decline, reflecting sluggish external
demand, and, in most countries, weak domestic demand. Recent data on real
GDP, industrial production, and especially exports have shown slowing or
outright declines in most countries. Inflation remains generally subdued.
Financial and economic conditions in Argentina deteriorated further, but have
generated only moderate spillovers to most other emerging markets.
Economic and financial conditions in Argentina have continued to deteriorate.
Real GDP fell 0.8 percent in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.), and fourth-quarter real
GDP was revised down significantly. More recent indicators were also weak.
Industrial production, which had ticked up in April and May, more than retraced
those gains in June. Auto sales plunged again in June, while retail sales
indicators were mixed, and consumer confidence remained weak. Tax revenue
fell almost 9 percent in June from the previous year, including a 22-1/2 percent
drop in the cyclically sensitive VAT revenues. The unemployment rate rose to
16.4 percent in May-a percentage point above the last reading in October, and
consumer prices fell 1.1 percent over the twelve months ended June. The June
trade surplus rose, reflecting flat exports and a sizable drop in imports.
The financial sector has been in turmoil over the past month and a half. In
mid-June, spreads on sovereign debt, as measured by JP Morgan's EMBI+
index, were hovering just below 1000 basis points. However, political tensions
between the provinces and federal government unsettled markets in late June
and on July 10, yields at the bi-weekly auction of short-term government debt
reached a four-year high of 14 percent. EMBI+ spreads for Argentina
subsequently soared to nearly 1700 basis points and have generally remained
above 1400 basis points since mid-July, despite two major policy initiatives
intended to calm the markets. First, on July 11, the government announced a
"zero deficit" policy-a major fiscal austerity plan calling for the budget to be
balanced on a month-to-month basis. The plan calls for across-the-board cuts in
most government expenditures, including wages and pensions, but excluding
payments on debt and transfers to the provinces. The plan was approved by the
legislature in late July, and salaries and pensions were cut 13 percent. Second,
in early August, the government reached agreement with banks, pension funds,
and mutual funds in Argentina to exchange most of the $4.3 billion in short-term
debt maturing through the end of the year for longer-term debt, thus eliminating
the need to hold biweekly public auctions aimed at rolling over short-term debt.

IV-24
July saw an acceleration of private sector deposit withdrawals that has continued
into August. Since early July, deposits have fallen over $9 billion (almost
11 percent), coupled with a sizable outflow in foreign reserves of over $5 billion
(over 22 percent). These withdrawals are broad-based and have generated
increased concerns about the stability of the banking system and the resources
available to the government for maintaining the currency board.
As a result of these developments, the Argentine government has made a highly
publicized plea for international financial assistance, calling for an additional
$6-$9 billion in financial support from the IMF.

In Mexico, real GDP declined 1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, the third
consecutive quarterly decline. The fall in economic activity continues to reflect
largely weak external demand. That said, in June, imports declined even more
sharply than exports, leading to a sharp narrowing in the trade deficit. Twelve-
month consumer price inflation has continued to decline, falling to 5.9 percent
in July, below the year-end target of 6.5 percent.

With the very strong peso, inflation declining, and economic activity weakening,
the Bank of Mexico (BOM) loosened monetary policy at the end of July, the
second such easing since the end of May. Subsequently, at the August 7 auction
of Treasury bills (Cetes), the yield on 28-day Cetes fell to 7.2 percent, a record
low. In early August, the Mexican government issued abroad $1.5 billion in
30-year bonds at only 340 basis points above U.S. Treasuries. The government
will use part of the proceeds from the swap to retire Brady bonds. Negotiations
on fiscal reform measures have continued and are aimed in part at reducing
Mexico's dependence on revenues from oil. A draft reform proposal is expected
to be ready when Congress reconvenes in early September.

In Brazil, real GDP declined nearly 4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, led
by a nearly 11 percent decline in industrial output. The sharp drop in output
reflects the effects of a series of interest rate hikes put in place since March and
an electricity shortage. The weakening of the economy contributed to a
narrowing in the trade balance in June. Inflation reached 7.5 percent on a
year-over-year basis in July, up from its level earlier in the year and well above
the central bank's mid-point target of 4 percent for December 2001. Inflationary
pressures have been fueled by the depreciation of the real over the past few
months.

The Brazilian real and other Brazilian asset prices have been hit especially hard
by the troubles in Argentina. In response, the Brazilian central bank and
government have taken several major steps aimed at supporting the currency. In
late June and mid-July, the central bank raised interest rates by a total of
225 basis points, to 19 percent. In June, the central bank sold over $1.3 billion
to support the currency, and in early July, announced that it would sell up to
$6 billion over the rest of the year ($50 million per day) to provide additional
foreign currency to the private sector. In late June, the Brazilian government
drew an additional $2 billion from its current IMF program and announced that
it would not prepay $1.8 billion later this year, as it had previously indicated.
Finally, in early August, the IMF announced that Brazil would obtain a new,
mainly precautionary $15 billion IMF program to replace the current one, which
expires on December 1. (Previously, the government had maintained that the
program would not be renewed.) The program will run through the end of 2002.
Upon IMF Executive Board approval of the program, which is expected in
mid-September, $4.6 billion will be made available for Brazil. Under the
program, the Brazilian government commits to tightening fiscal policies and to
practicing monetary discipline.

Sparse Venezuelan data since the last FOMC meeting suggest a continued
moderation from the rapid growth at the end of 2000. Aside from a few fast
growing sectors such as communications, the non-oil industries continue to
languish. The slowdown in inflation has stalled in recent months, with inflation
rising to 13 percent on a twelve-month basis in July. Capital flight remains a
concern, with about $1 billion leaving the country each month, according to
June central bank estimates. In early August, the currency came under further
downward pressure. The central bank responded by increasing some reserve
requirements and restricting banks' access to foreign currency.

In Korea, activity appears to have weakened further in recent months. Industrial
production decreased for the third consecutive month in June, registering a
decline from its year-earlier level for the first time in nearly two years. A further
sharp drop in the production of semiconductors was again a key feature of the
overall drop of industrial production. The index of business sentiment
deteriorated noticeably in July, especially among export-oriented industries.
Despite the pronounced recent weakness in the manufacturing sector, consumer
spending appears to be holding up surprisingly well, and the forward-looking
index of consumer confidence rose to its highest level in ten months in June.
In response to growing evidence of overall economic weakness, macroeconomic
policy has started to move toward a more stimulative stance. In early July and
again in early August, the Bank of Korea lowered its policy rate by 25 basis
points, the second and third such reductions this year, bringing the rate down to

IV-28
4.5 percent. The two most recent reductions were undertaken despite the
inflation rate remaining above its 2 percent to 4 percent target range. In early
August, the government announced that it would introduce a supplementary
budget involving a modest amount of new spending and an accelerated schedule
of previously announced public works projects.

Recent economic indicators in the ASEAN region generally indicate continued
slowing in economic activity. In the second quarter, industrial production fell
sharply in Malaysia and real GDP plummeted in Singapore, due to weak
external demand for high-tech goods. Industrial output edged down in Thailand
as well. In Indonesia, second quarter real GDP is estimated to have risen nearly
12 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the first quarter. All of the countries in the region have
experienced falling exports in recent months. The decline is most noticeable in
the region's electronics exporters but is also evident in the data for Thailand and
Indonesia. Due to sharp declines in imports of intermediate goods, however,
trade balances have not fallen as sharply. Inflation picked up in Thailand and
Indonesia in the second quarter, fueled by currency depreciation, but inflation
remained stable in the rest of the region. In response to weakness in their
economies, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand have implemented fiscal
stimulus packages.

Some of the political problems that have been a source of uncertainty in the
region have diminished recently. In Indonesia, Megawati Sukarnoputri became
president after former-President Wahid was impeached in late July. The transfer
of power was surprisingly peaceful, and financial markets have reacted
favorably. The rupiah has appreciated against the dollar by about 20 percent. In
Thailand, Prime Minister Thaksin was cleared of corruption charges that could

IV-30
have led to his removal from office, and in the Philippines, a cease-fire was
signed with a separatist group that may put an end to a 30-year revolt in the
southern islands.

In China, recent indicators suggest that growth has moderated slightly from its
rapid pace in the first quarter. Real GDP growth in the second quarter is
estimated at 7.5 percent (s.a.a.r.), led by strong consumer demand. Investment
was boosted by increased government spending on infrastructure and a pickup in
inflows of foreign direct investment. Industrial output growth in July slowed
somewhat from the twelve-month growth rates registered earlier this year.
China has begun to feel the impact of the global economic slowdown, with
exports falling nearly 7 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter. However, in June
and July, exports rebounded slightly, although they remain at a lower level than
in the first quarter. Partly reflecting the strength of domestic demand, the
twelve-month inflation rate moved up to 1.6 percent in the second quarter, the
highest rate in nearly four years.
In Hong Kong, data received since the last FOMC meeting point to continued
sluggishness. For the second quarter as a whole, exports continued to slide on
balance, falling to a level about 7 percent (s.a.) below their first-quarter average.
The value of retail sales on average in April and May was nearly 3 percent (s.a.)
below the first-quarter level. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at
4.6 percent (s.a.) in the April-June period. Deflation in Hong Kong eased
slightly in June after heavy rains pushed food prices higher and the rate of
decline in private housing rental prices lessened.

In Taiwan, recent indicators suggest that the economy has slipped into
recession. June industrial production fell 2.4 percent (s.a.) and the
unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent (s.a.). In addition, exports have declined
as exports of electronics and information technology products have sagged.
Consumer prices increased slightly in July on a twelve-month basis, after two
months of modest declines. To combat declining demand, Taiwan's central
bank eased interest rates at the end of June, the seventh rate decline since
December 2000.
