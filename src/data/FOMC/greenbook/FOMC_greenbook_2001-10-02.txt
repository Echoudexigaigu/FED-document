Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Economic activity remained on a very sluggish track up to the eve of the
September 11 terrorist attacks. Household expenditures continued to expand
moderately, while business investment remained on a steep downward slide.
Only a few nonfinancial indicators are available for the period since the attacks.
Consequently, our assessment of recent developments focuses much more
heavily than usual on anecdotes and the results of various private surveys. As
best we can tell, activity seems to have weakened further after the attacks.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market continued to deteriorate in August. Private payroll
employment fell 110,000, with job losses in manufacturing more than
accounting for the decline. Outside of manufacturing, employment continued to
increase, though hiring was sluggish and uneven. Aggregate weekly hours of
production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm private payrolls fell another
0.4 percent, leaving the level of aggregate hours in August about 3-1/2 percent
(at an annual rate) below its second-quarter average.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate in August increased
0.4 percentage point, to 4.9 percent, after having held roughly steady at
4.5 percent since April. Although the jump was surprisingly large for one
month, the absence of a rise in unemployment in previous months had seemed at
odds with the ongoing payroll declines; the August level of the jobless rate
appears quite consistent with other indicators of the labor market.
Recent weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggest that
the contraction of payrolls has continued since August. After having dipped to
392,000 in the week ended September 15, claims jumped to 450,000 in the week
ended September 22, and the four-week moving average of weekly claims
moved up to 422,000. The insured unemployment rate was 2.6 percent in the
week ended September 15; it has changed little in recent weeks but is up almost
a full percentage point over the past year.
The employment figures for September should not be greatly affected by the
terrorist attacks, even though they occurred in the middle of the survey week.
An individual is included in the employment figures as long as he or she is paid
for a single hour during the survey period. Individuals most likely were able to
work regularly in the days before the attacks, and most businesses that shut
down on September 11 appear to have resumed operations soon thereafter; so
the effect on the payroll employment numbers should be small. However,
layoffs that have since been announced, including more than 100,000 by airlines
and related industries, will likely be showing through into the employment
estimates for coming months. Temporary shutdowns may well have led to a

further reduction in the average workweek and an exaggeration of the drop in
aggregate hours worked compared with what otherwise would have occurred.1
We believe that the decline in hours occurred primarily in Manhattan and in the
airline and hospitality industries.
Industrial Production
Industrial production fell in August for the eleventh consecutive month.
Assemblies of motor vehicles dropped back about one-half million units,
reversing a similar-sized gain in July. Production of high-tech goods declined
1.4 percent in August-somewhat less than earlier in the summer and late
spring. Outside the motor vehicles and high-tech industries, manufacturing
output was down 0.8 percent, reflecting declines in the production of business
equipment, consumer goods, and materials. The overall factory operating rate
fell to 74.6 percent in August, the lowest rate since the middle of 1983.

Pentagon will reportedly be paid for the entire week.

II-9
Before the terrorist attacks, the industrial sector appeared to be headed toward
further contraction, but perhaps at a less rapid rate than over the previous few
months. Real adjusted durable goods orders rose 0.8 percent in August after
having fallen 1.8 percent in July. The National Association of Purchasing
Management's new orders diffusion index jumped above 50 in August, the first
time this year that respondents reporting an increase in orders outnumbered
those reporting decreases. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's Business
Outlook Survey showed general activity continuing to decline in September,
though at a slower rate than in August.
The high-tech sector remained weak on the eve of the attacks. Semiconductor
orders had continued to fall, and inventories held by large buyers of chips
remained well above target levels through August. Producers of computer
networking equipment, fiber optic gear, and cell phones continued to face
declining demand and excess stocks.
Motor vehicle production was significantly affected by the terrorist attacks. On
September 11, Ford and Chrysler suspended their second and third shifts at all
their plants; GM and Toyota stopped their lines at some plants. During the rest
of the week, distribution glitches developed, especially at border crossings.
Ford experienced by far the worst problems from parts shortages, reporting that
output for the rest of the week was 50 percent below the scheduled rate.
However, other companies saw only isolated stoppages, and there were no
reports of disruptions the following week. All told, we estimate that September
motor vehicle assemblies were reduced by 670,000 units (annual rate) as a direct
result of the attacks. Weekly data suggest production will fall to 10.8 million
units at an annual rate for the month. The decline in output of motor vehicles
and parts due to the attacks will shave about 1/4 percent off September
industrial production.
In other industries, disruptions of production were much less pronounced.
Disturbances to supply chains temporarily lengthened delivery times for some
products, and there were a few reports of temporary shutdowns at plants
producing printers, musical instruments, and wood products. In the
semiconductor industry, wafers produced in the United States, as well as
finished chips assembled in foreign countries, were not shipped for five days
after the attacks. However, downstream domestic producers had ample
inventories, and production was little affected. A major computer maker, for
example, reported that it could not receive components for several days, but,
because demand subsided at the same time, most orders were filled. In many
other industries, including industrial equipment, construction supplies,
construction machinery, paper, glass, chemicals, industrial equipment and
fiberglass, reports that we received indicated no disruption.

The attacks severely damaged prospects for commercial aircraft production.
Before these events, Boeing expected aircraft deliveries to be down about
5 percent next year from the projected level for 2001. Since September 11,
several customers have asked not to take aircraft slated for delivery later this
year, and new orders are expected to decline. As a result, Boeing has announced
that it plans to eliminate 30,000 jobs (a third of its commercial aircraft assembly
workforce) in anticipation of a drop in deliveries in 2002 of another 20 percent.
Production of commercial aircraft, which had already eased slightly this year,
will likely fall further in coming months and plunge more noticeably next year.5
Consumer Spending
Consumer spending seemed to be gaining a bit more vigor over the summer,
likely buoyed to some extent by recent tax rebates.6 In real terms, sales of goods
excluding motor vehicles rose briskly in both July and August. Although sales
of new light vehicles fell in both months, total real outlays for goods in the two
months were an estimated 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate above their second-
quarter average.
5. Even with near-term adjustments to production, Boeing may need to inventory some
completed planes.
6. Real disposable personal income jumped 1.8 percent in July-boosted 1.3 percentage
points by a combination of tax rebates and a reduction in tax rates. Tax rebates should further
boost disposable personal income in August and September.

The scattered indicators for September suggest that spending has probably
declined this month. Before September 11, our contacts in the auto industry
expected light vehicle sales to remain at about a 16 million unit annual pace in
the short term. However, auto industry contacts report confidentially that
showroom traffic dried up immediately after the terrorist attacks. One firm
reported that sales in that period were down 28 percent from the same period a
year ago; before September 11 they had been running a bit ahead of last year's
pace. More recently, our industry contacts and a survey of auto dealerships by
J.D. Power suggest that sales have improved somewhat, though they are still
below the pace seen earlier in the month.
Weekly data on chain store sales from the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM)
indicate that sales at the stores in its panel were generally "at or above plan"
through September 8. Sales and traffic in stores were down precipitously on
September 11, but began to recover the following day. For the week as a whole,
sales were down 1.4 percent. The following week, extending through
September 22, the BTM measure of chain store sales fell another 0.8 percent.
The terrorist attacks also adversely affected services expenditures in September.
With air traffic halted for almost four days and subsequent reports of a large fall
in demand, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for air travel (0.4 percent
of total PCE) will likely be down substantially this month.7 Spending at hotels
and motels (0.4 percent of total PCE) has likely declined appreciably. Many
spectator sports (0.2 percent of total PCE) were canceled or postponed.8
Surprisingly, perhaps, real PCE for brokerage services (0.5 percent of total PCE)
probably will not fall much, if at all. Although stock trading was halted for four
days, volume soared after the resumption of activity on September 17, leaving
trading volumes for the month as a whole close to normal.
Consumer sentiment was weakening before the terrorist attacks. Preliminary
September data from the Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC), which
included responses through September 10, showed the overall index down
almost 8 percentage points from August, reflecting in part greater concern
among consumers about their current personal finances and future business
7. Airlines have announced that they plan to reduce capacity to about 80 percent of its
pre-attack level. However, this is unlikely to be a significant constraint on demand in the near
term given the downshift in air travel.
8. Other relatively small components of services that are likely to be affected by the
terrorist attacks include real PCE for rail and bus travel, movies, and theaters. Real expenditures
for motor vehicle insurance and life insurance are unlikely to be affected, at least initially. The
BEA has announced that any surge in motor vehicle claims will involve offsetting increases in
nominal outlays and the corresponding price index. Initial estimates of life insurance are
extrapolated from one month to the next using changes in wages and salaries of insurance
industry employees. Subsequent estimates will likely be revised down reflecting lower profits
arising from life insurance claims.

conditions. The Conference Board index of consumer confidence tumbled more
than 16 points in September to its lowest level since January 1996. All of the
major components of the index fell. The Conference Board noted that
88 percent of responses were received before September 11 and that, although
responses received after this date "differed slightly, there was no reversal in the
downward trend of the index."9 The "consumer comfort index," a four-week
moving average of responses obtained in a weekly survey of about 1,000 adults
by ABC News and Money magazine, has, like the other indexes, fallen
dramatically over the past year. Surprisingly perhaps, the index ticked up in the
week ended September 16 and was unchanged during the week ended
September 23.
Housing Markets
Housing activity appeared to be softening a bit prior to the terrorist attacks.
Single-family housing starts fell 2-1/2 percent in August, to 1.25 million units at
an annual rate, and the July reading was revised down slightly. In addition,
multifamily housing starts dropped 23 percent to 280,000 units (annual rate) in
August, after jumping to 363,000 units in July. New home sales edged up to
898,000 units at an annual rate in August, but the estimates for June and July
were revised down; the new data show sales having changed little since April.
Sales of existing homes rose to a record high 5.5 million units in August, but the
August results represent sales at the time of closing and reflect commitments
made a few weeks earlier.
Some of our more timely indicators of housing demand have downshifted a
little in recent weeks. Builders' rating of new home sales declined in
September to a level a bit below the lower end of its range in recent months.10
The Mortgage Bankers Association weekly index of applications for
mortgages to finance the purchase of a home declined noticeably in the week
ended September 14 and then was little changed the following week. The
four-week moving average of purchase applications has declined to the lower
end of its elevated range of the past year and a half, despite low mortgage
rates. By contrast, the Michigan Survey's measure of households' attitudes
toward homebuying maintained, in the preliminary September reading, the
strong uptrend it has shown since the middle of last year.
A few attempts have been made in the real estate industry to gauge how housing
demand might be affected by the events of September 11. The National
Association of Home Builders polled thirty builders on September 19 and 20.
Most of them reported that sales held up during the week ending September 16,
although buyer traffic declined. Because builders have a large enough backlog
9. In a separate release on September 19, the Conference Board stated that an analysis of
pre- and post-September 11 responses would be released at a later time.
10. Data collection was completed before September 11.

of orders to keep them busy for the next one or two quarters, they are reportedly
not making major changes to their plans over that period. A member survey by
the National Association of Realtors found an initial falloff in buyer traffic
during the week of the attacks that was followed by some pickup over the
following weekend.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment continued to contract over the summer. Since the
attacks, there have been many reports of businesses hunkering down further,
with concerns about future profits and cash flow being reinforced by the sharp
decline in equity prices after the stock markets opened on September 17.
Equipment and software. Real outlays for equipment and software appear to
have declined further in the third quarter following a precipitous drop in the
second quarter. Indeed, apart from the sizable increase in outlays on airplanes
by domestic carriers in July and August, the main indicators for each major
component of real spending on equipment and software were on sharp
downward trajectories into late summer. Shipments of nondefense capital
goods excluding aircraft declined about 2 percent in both July and August. New
orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft ticked up 0.2 percent in
August but were about 5 percent below the average for the second quarter.
Although it is too early to have precise estimates of the impact of the events of
September 11 on the replacement demand for capital goods and software, initial
estimates of property damage indicate that the increment to aggregate nominal
spending on high-tech equipment and software is likely to be small-on the
order of $3 billion to $4 billion.
Spending on aircraft is almost certain to drop sharply in coming months. In the
wake of the terrorist attacks, air travel has fallen off dramatically, and domestic
airlines-which were already struggling-are rapidly scaling back purchases of
new aircraft. As mentioned earlier, Boeing has slashed its production plans in
expectation of reduced demand over the next year or so.
Elsewhere in the transportation sector, motor vehicle investment has remained
weak. Sales of medium and heavy trucks in August-432,000 at an annual rate
-were little changed from July and were 18,000 units below the second-quarter
average. Orders and backlogs of medium and heavy trucks appear to have
flattened out at low levels. The decline in air travel has been accompanied by a
substantial decline in car rentals. Daily rental companies are reported to have
cancelled a large number of orders for light vehicles.
Nonresidential construction. Real expenditures for nonresidential structures
dropped at an annual rate of 11-1/4 percent in the second quarter, not quite as
much as previously indicated but nevertheless the largest percentage decline

since early 1994. For the buildings component of nonresidential structures,
expenditures increased some in July, but they were still below the second-
quarter average.11
Only rough guesses can be made at this time about the extent, timing, and
location of reconstruction efforts arising from the destruction at the World
Trade Center. Commercial real estate firms estimate that roughly 30 million
square feet of office space was destroyed or damaged-about 7 percent of the
New York City supply. We estimate that the cost of replacing this office
space might be around $6 billion to $8 billion.
Business Inventories
Stocks continued to run off at a rapid clip in July, the last month for which we
have complete data. Large liquidations were reported in manufacturing and,
excluding vehicles, in both wholesale trade and retail trade. However, despite
the July reductions in stocks, overhangs were still apparent for several
industries, notably computers and electrical goods, machinery, chemicals,
primary and fabricated metals, textiles, and paper products.
The limited data we have for August show further liquidation. In the motor
vehicles industry, dealers' stocks of both automobiles and light trucks edged
down. Days' supply of automobiles remained low, but days' supply of light
trucks was still above its desired level. Inventories held by manufacturers of
durable goods fell at an annual rate of nearly $25 billion in August; the average
rate of liquidation in July and August in this part of the manufacturing sector
was a little faster than the average for the second quarter. Nonetheless, the
inventory-sales ratio for producers of durable goods edged up last month, led by
a further noticeable rise in the ratio for producers of computers.12
In the days immediately following the attacks, many of the normal means of
transporting goods were disrupted to some degree, leaving a few firms
scrambling to obtain the inputs needed to maintain operations at desired levels
and other firms, both here and abroad, with unintended backups. Serious
problems were not widespread, however, and most of the disruptions that did
emerge seem to have eased within a few days. The disruption to the inventory
11. The buildings component includes construction of office, industrial, retail, warehouse,
lodging, and institutional facilities, and excludes mining, drilling activity, and utility
construction.
12. The August release for the durable goods industries also showed a steeper rate of
liquidation in July than was previously reported. In the absence of an offsetting change in the
stocks of nondurables, the July liquidation for manufacturing as a whole will also be larger than
the published data currently show, by about 7-1/2 billion at an annual rate.

distribution system stemming from the temporary suspension of air cargo
service turned out to be quite limited.13
Government Sector
Federal. Fiscal policy appears to be on a substantially more expansionary
track in the wake of the terrorist attacks. On September 18, the President
signed a $40 billion supplemental appropriations bill. The bill allows the
President to transfer up to $20 billion to any department or agency in order to
(1) improve government preparedness for mitigating and responding to the
attacks; (2) counter, investigate, or prosecute terrorists; (3) increase
transportation security; (4) repair public facilities; and (5) enhance national
security. The remaining $20 billion will have to go through the usual
appropriations process. In addition, the Congress passed a $15 billion package
of financial assistance for the airline industry on September 21. This included
$5 billion to compensate carriers for losses incurred as a result of the terrorist
attacks and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees.
Meanwhile, work on the regular fiscal 2002 spending bills has slowed, and the
spending outlook remains uncertain, in part because the Congress and the
Administration are still developing plans for the emergency funds.14
Countercyclical tax proposals have been put forth by some members of the
Congress, and the Administration is reported to be considering an economic
stimulus plan.
In the federal budget data for July and August, outlays were buffeted by
special factors, including a re-estimate of spectrum auction credit subsidies,
the acceleration of some payments usually made in September, and an August
surge in payments to farmers. Abstracting from these factors, overall outlays
have been increasing at a moderate rate, albeit slightly faster than earlier this
year. The pickup in spending reflects rapid increases in Medicare, Medicaid,
and income-support programs, the latter due in part to rising unemployment
benefit payments.
13. Major cargo carriers, such as FedEx, United Parcel Service, and Emery Worldwide,
resumed flying full schedules beginning on the Saturday following the attacks. Moreover, the
Federal Aviation Administration announced on that Saturday that passenger carriers could
resume transporting cargo, though subject to tighter rules. Apart from lengthy waits at border
crossings, disruptions to the trucking industry also were reported to be limited. Freight and
mail carriers that switched to trucks while air traffic was grounded for the most part used their
own excess trucks, which they had on hand for peak holiday periods.
14. At this time, the spending bills appear to be in line with the Administration's proposals,
including this summer's amended defense proposal, which boosts budget authority by
$18-1/2 billion and is estimated to raise outlays in fiscal 2002 about $10 billion.

II-29
Receipts in July and August fell 8 percent from year-earlier levels, partly
reflecting the payout of $25 billion in rebates and the notching down of
withholding schedules for higher income earners. Excluding the effects of the
tax cuts, receipts in July and August rose a sluggish 2 percent relative to a year
earlier. The IRS reports that it sent $11 billion of rebates in September.
According to daily data, nonwithheld income tax receipts in September are
coming in well below last year's level, in part because of changes in filing
deadlines resulting from the terrorist attacks. The CBO has revised down its
estimate of the fiscal 2001 budget surplus to $121 billion, from an August
estimate of $153 billion, mainly because of the weakness in receipts over the
past couple of months.
State and local. Spending by state and local governments apparently
remained strong in the third quarter. The increase in employment averaged
47,000 in July and August, well above the 34,000 average monthly gain during
the first half of the year. Many of the new jobs were in education. Further
large increases in state and local consumption expenditures have arisen in
connection with the cleanup and recovery from the terrorist attacks. Press
reports suggested that roughly one-half billion dollars was spent on New
York's recovery effort in the two weeks following the collapse of the World
Trade Center. The total cost seems likely to be at least a few billion dollars.
Most expenditures will take the form of contracts for services and
compensation for overtime and supplemental workers; some of the workers
and funding will likely be diverted from other programs.
Construction data for the sector have been strong as well. Real construction
spending rose 1.3 percent in July, to a level 2.2 percent above the second-
quarter level (not at an annual rate). The increase in July was concentrated in
educational facilities.
We continue to get reports that some states are struggling with budget
shortfalls. In addressing their difficulties, many of these states seem to be
focusing on a combination of strategies, especially spending cuts along with
debt issuance to fund projects that would otherwise have been financed with
tax revenues. The direction of tax changes has been mixed. The National
Conference of State Legislatures estimates that net tax cuts during this
spring's legislative session were the smallest in seven years.
Prices and Labor Costs
Core consumer price inflation remained modest in July and August.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in each of those two
months, about the same rate of increase as in the second quarter. PCE prices
continued to rise less rapidly than the CPI.

Energy prices. The CPI for energy fell sharply in July and August. However,
the September report likely will bring a sizable rebound, as prices of
petroleum products pushed higher after mid-summer in response to another
round of refinery disruptions and tightening supplies. The September 11
attacks caused prices to increase further, but only briefly. At retail, there were
scattered reports of panic buying and price spikes for gasoline for a day or so,
mostly in the Midwest. However, by September 17, the Department of Energy
reported that retail gasoline prices were virtually unchanged from their level
on September 10. Crude prices moved higher immediately after the attacks,
but they have since turned down sharply in response to pledges by various
members of OPEC to maintain supplies and to rising expectations in the
market that sluggish economies here and abroad will substantially curb oil
demand. Wholesale gasoline prices are also down sharply.
Last year's spectacular run-up of natural gas prices has continued to unwind.
Gas futures quotes for the coming winter are about one-third the level of spot
prices last winter. In sharp contrast to the situation for petroleum products,
inventories of natural gas have continued to rise with unusual speed, as
production has remained strong and demand sluggish. These inventories are
now near their highest level in the past five years.
In electricity markets, upward price pressures dissipated over the summer.
The CPI for electricity edged down in August after having increased almost
9 percent (not at an annual rate) over the first seven months of the year. The
difficulties anticipated in California failed to materialize.
Food prices. Consumer food prices rose 0.2 percent in August, keeping the
twelve-month change for this series slightly above 3 percent. Through
August, consumer food prices had accelerated 0.4 percentage point on a year-
over-year basis, boosted by a rebound in farm prices over the past twelve
months. This week's futures quotes suggest that farm prices will register a
moderate decline over the coming four quarters.
Core consumer prices. For the twelve months ending in August, the CPI
excluding food and energy rose 2.7 percent, only slightly more than in the
year-earlier period. Prices for core commodities fell 0.4 percent in August,
partly reflecting weak demand for autos and for computers and electronics.
In contrast, prices for core services increased 0.5 percent in August; both
owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent continued to rise at elevated rates. In
addition, the index for medical services jumped 0.6 percent in August; it has
risen 4.7 percent over the past twelve months, a touch more than in the year-
earlier period. Tuition increased 0.9 percent in August, bringing the twelve-
month change for that category to 5.7 percent.

II-37
Core PCE price inflation continued to run lower than core CPI price inflation
this summer; the August reading on the CPI suggests that core PCE prices rose
only 0.1 percent that month. Core PCE prices rose an estimated 1.8 percent in
the twelve months to August, compared with 2 percent in the twelve months to
August 2000.
Producer prices. Prices for capital goods as measured by the producer price
index edged down 0.1 percent in August, leaving the twelve-month change for
this series at 0.7 percent, 1/2 percentage point below the year-earlier increase.
Prices for computers plunged 9 percent in August and were almost 25 percent
below their year-earlier level, one of the largest reductions in recent years.
Prices for communications equipment have also slipped substantially over the
past several months, led downward by decreases for networking equipment.
Core inflation measures at earlier stages of processing continued to fall in both
July and August; the index for intermediate materials was 0.7 percent below
the level of a year earlier, and the index for crude materials was down almost
10 percent.
Commodity prices. As of September 10, indexes of materials prices, such as
those of the Journal of Commerce and the Commodity Research Bureau, were
down 1-1/2 percent to 3 percent from their levels at the time of the August
Greenbook. Since then, the prices of gold and silver have moved up, on net,
but the prices of other metals, agricultural raw materials, and forest products
generally have fallen steeply. As of September 25, the Journal of Commerce
industrial index was down 3-1/2 percent from its pre-attack level and off about
5 percent since the week of the last Greenbook. The Commodity Research
Bureau indexes, both spot and futures, also have declined sharply.
Expected inflation. Survey measures of inflation expectations have turned
down in recent months. The median response to the University of Michigan
survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations stood at 2.6 percent in
September, almost 1/2 percentage point lower than the average for the fourth
quarter of 2000. The median expectation over five to ten years was
2.9 percent in the early-September reading, down 0.1 percentage point from
the August level and at the low end of the narrow range reported for the year
to date.
Labor costs. In August, average hourly earnings of production or
nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent, following a 0.2 percent rise in July.
Over the past twelve months, average hourly earnings increased 4.2 percent, a
pickup of 0.4 percentage point from the preceding twelve months and a
reading that is toward the upper end of the range seen since the mid-1990s.
However, most of the past year's step-up was already in place by the end of
2000. The twelve-month change has since held fairly steady at around
4-1/4 percent.

Some large increases in health insurance costs have been announced for 2002.
Premiums for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program-the
largest employer-sponsored program in the nation-will go up an estimated
13.3 percent, on average, next year, following an increase of 10.5 percent in
2001. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) has
announced increases in premiums for 2002 that are expected to average about
9-1/2 percent, as well as substantially higher copayments on drugs and office
visits for HMO members.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
The damage to New York's financial district on September 11 significantly
disrupted the operation of financial markets, causing most to close temporarily.
The Federal Reserve responded by providing massive liquidity to the banking
sector immediately after the attacks and by cutting the federal funds rate target
by 50 basis points on September 17. While activity and liquidity in most
markets recovered in subsequent days, the attacks have fueled fears of recession,
reducing investors' willingness to hold risky securities and bolstering
expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy further.
In the days following the attacks, investors shifted down their expectation of the
federal funds rate path and began a widespread repricing of risk. Short-term
Treasury yields fell dramatically on the anticipation of additional rate cuts and
flight-to-safety demands, stock prices tumbled, credit spreads soared, and
implied volatilities spiked. This negative reevaluation of the economic outlook
followed on the heels of the already weaker economic news that had been
weighing on markets before the attacks.
Available data for the third quarter suggests that debt growth by both businesses
and consumers had slowed noticeably from the first-half pace, even prior to
September 11. The market interruption appears to have accelerated a reduction
in borrowing by firms and to have induced some temporary substitution to bank
credit from the commercial paper and bond markets. The federal government,
on the other hand, has returned to the credit markets as a net issuer of debt in
recent months and is now expected to pay down debt more slowly in the months
ahead.
Policy Expectations, Interest Rates, and Stock Prices
Investors had largely anticipated the FOMC's decision on August 21 to lower
the federal funds rate 25 basis points, and the announcement had relatively little
effect on financial markets. Before September 11, expectations of additional
monetary easing had on balance increased, especially after the weaker-than-
expected August employment report released on September 7. The terrorist
attacks led to additional declines in federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates,
and money market participants were only modestly surprised by the 50 basis
point easing prior to the reopening of equity markets on September 17. Judging
from current futures prices and market surveys, market participants see high
odds of an additional 50 basis points of easing at the October FOMC meeting.
The Treasury market suffered from settlement delays, loss of critical
infrastructure, and thin trading upon reopening after the attacks. Activity has
since improved, though trading in off-the-run securities has continued to lag.
Over the intermeeting period, the slope of the Treasury yield curve steepened
dramatically. Yields on two-year Treasury notes declined about 90 basis points,

reflecting the revision in near-term policy expectations and safe-haven demands.
At the same time, the yield on the ten-year note was down only about 23 basis
points and the long-bond yield was little changed reflecting concerns that
dwindling tax revenues and increased spending would boost the Treasury's
borrowing requirements.
After being closed for the rest of the week following the terrorist attacks, equity
markets reopened with a sell-off of 5 percent that day for the market as a whole.
Declines were widespread, but airline and hotel stocks were hit hardest, losing
almost 30 percent each. Market operations were reportedly normal, though
trading volume on the NYSE hit a record high. Since the reopening, stock
prices have sagged a bit further on net, leaving broad equity price
indexes-which had already fallen between 7 percent and 10 percent on the
weak economic news before the attacks-down 14 percent to 22 percent since
the August FOMC meeting. Households, in the aftermath of the attacks,
accelerated their ongoing shift out of equity mutual funds and into money
market and bond funds.
Equity analysts are in the process of reassessing the implications for corporate
profits of the worsening outlook for near-term economic growth. Published
estimates, which still imply a rebound in third-quarter earnings from the second-
quarter level, have yet to be updated, even for airlines and hotels. Substantial
downward revisions are likely after companies provide further guidance
regarding the third quarter.
Trading in corporate bonds virtually ceased while the stock exchanges were
closed but has since recovered slowly, with greatly reduced liquidity in the high-
yield segment. When trading resumed, credit spreads opened up as investors
shied away from holding risky securities. Spreads on ten-year BBB- and AA-
rated bonds over AAA-rated bonds widened about 20 basis points over the
intermeeting period. High-yield spreads, which had widened considerably
before the attacks as equity values dropped, ballooned after September 11; these
spreads now exceed 800 basis points, an increase of nearly 150 basis points
from the August FOMC meeting. In contrast, spreads of agency debt and
interest-rate swaps over Treasuries have narrowed a bit since the August FOMC
meeting, reflecting the prospects for more supply of Treasury debt.
Credit spreads on commercial paper, even for top-tier issuers, also jumped
immediately following the attacks, as risks of payment delays increased
significantly. Both the repayment of maturing paper and the issuance of new
paper were hindered in the two days following the attacks, and bank lines
reportedly were drawn in volume by those seeking new funds. However, by the
end of the week of the attacks, issuance volumes had returned to normal levels,
suggesting no lingering liquidity squeeze, although credit spreads remain
elevated.

Business Finance
The market disruption and associated pullback from risk-taking has reduced the
volume of corporate financing. Both bond and equity issues were postponed,
and new issuance volumes remain below pre-attack levels. Nonfinancial
corporations have not completed any IPOs since late August, and raised less
than $400 million through seasoned offerings. Bond issuance in September,
which was on pace to match the robust August level before the attacks, will now
fall short of that level, although issuance of investment-grade bonds has
resumed. High-yield issuance, which had already tailed off in mid-August, has
yet to start up again as heightened credit-quality concerns take their toll.
Business loans made by banks jumped after the attacks, but, in part, appear to
reflect a temporary substitution from other debt, in particular commercial paper.
On net, growth in commercial paper and C&I loans in September is expected to
be slightly negative, similar to the pace in August, leaving net corporate
borrowing very low relative to the first half of the year.
Announcements of share repurchases had stalled in July and August as firms'
profits fell, but the SEC's temporary easing of share repurchase restrictions, in
an effort to buoy equity prices after the market shutdown, appears to have
spurred a spate of opportunistic buying. Since the SEC's announcement, about
100 firms have announced new repurchase programs totaling about $20 billion;
still, total announcements for the third quarter are well below recent peaks.
While timely reporting of actual share repurchases does not exist, anecdotal
reports from dealers indicate elevated buyback activity in the first few days after
the market reopened. Domestic cash mergers in the third quarter have not
evaporated with the profits malaise, especially those involving energy firms or
the restructuring of distressed firms, but activity has been curtailed since the
attacks. On balance, equity retirements in the third quarter are likely to match
the moderate first-half pace.
Corporate credit quality continued to deteriorate over the intermeeting period.
Prior to the attacks, both GM and Ford had all of their debt-a total of $290
billion-put on watch for a downgrade to A3 by Moody's and to A- by S&P's.
The economic fallout from the attacks makes these downgrades nearly certain,
and Daimler/Chrysler (already A3/A- rated) has since also been put on watch for
a downgrade. Pre-attack readings on business failures, junk-bond defaults, and
net downgrades all indicate a continued elevated level of distress, and these
measures can be expected to weaken further in the wake of the disaster. Nearly
all of the major domestic airlines have been downgraded following the terrorist
attacks, and firms in other sectors directly affected-including airline
manufacturers, hotel and lodging operators, and some insurance
companies-have been put on watch for downgrades.
More broadly, the widespread decline in equity values suggests significantly
higher expected default probabilities as more persistent cash flow weakness puts

debt payments at risk. Credit spreads on junk-rated bonds in nearly every
industry group have jumped, with those on airline bonds exploding almost 800
basis points. Credit spreads for domestic insurance companies increased by less
than might have been feared, as these companies appear to have ample capital
and diversification to absorb the expected losses. European re-insurance
companies are likely to be the focus of credit-quality concerns, and two major
firms have already been downgraded.
Growth of commercial mortgage debt appears to have remained solid in the
third quarter, though down somewhat from the surprisingly strong 13 percent
rate of increase in the second quarter. Trading in commercial-mortgage-backed
securities (CMBS) was sparse after the terrorist attacks, with spreads to swaps
reportedly widening 8 basis points on AAA tranches and 20 basis points on
BBB tranches.1 Many CMBS deals that were in the pipeline and expected to be
issued by the end of September now have been postponed.
Household Finance
Household assets relative to disposable income are estimated to have fallen
sharply in the third quarter as the plunge in equity prices overwhelmed the
estimated increase in the value of homes. With the latest decline, the ratio of
household assets to disposable income has now retraced about 60 percent of its
run-up over the second half of the 1990s but still remains above its long-run
historical average.
Even before the terrorist attacks, households had been shifting investments from
equity to fixed income. This trend accelerated when equity markets reopened,
with an estimated $4 billion pulled out of domestic equity funds on Monday
September 17, followed by an additional $15 billion over the rest of the week as
stock prices tumbled. Outflows for the week amounted to about one-half of
1 percent of total fund assets, and for the month are on pace to match the
outflows seen in August 1990, but only about one-third the level of outflows in
October 1987. Daily data on transfer activity in 401(k) pension plans show the
same pattern, with ten times the normal transfer activity on Monday followed by
additional spikes later in the week. This weekly transfer activity is the largest
since the data began in 1997, and twice as large as the most active week during
the market crisis in the fall of 1998. Daily data for the most recent week show
that the pace of reallocation slowed dramatically as equity prices stabilized.
Mortgage rates edged down since the most recent FOMC meeting, with the
thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.8 percent, the lowest level since early
1999. Refinancing activity remains elevated, and growth in residential
1. The destruction of the World Trade Center is not expected to cause any defaults for the
CMBS backed by the WTC's rental income, because issuers are well insured.

mortgage debt in the third quarter is estimated to have been strong-around
8 percent at an annual rate-after an extremely rapid 12 percent pace in the
second quarter. Interest rates on consumer debt have moved little since the last
FOMC meeting, except for home-equity credit lines, which have fallen 26 basis
points. Consumer credit growth is estimated to have fallen to 2.0 percent in the
third quarter, apparently on a slowdown in consumer spending.
The latest data point to little change in household credit quality. Personal
bankruptcy filings in September have remained at a relatively high level. The
July delinquency rate on auto loans edged up, while the delinquency rate on
credit card pools edged down. Owing to less growth in residential mortgage
debt and the temporary effect of the tax rebates on disposable income, the
household debt service burden is estimated to have dropped below 14 percent in
the third quarter.
Treasury Finance
The disruptions to financial markets had some spillover to Treasury financing.
Most notably, in the week of the attacks, the Treasury canceled its $10 billion
four-week bill auction scheduled for September 11 and raised funds by drawing
down nearly all of its compensating balances with commercial banks, about
$12.6 billion in total. On Thursday of that same week, the $26 billion in three-
and six-month bills auctioned on September 10 settled, providing the Treasury
with adequate funds.
During the following week, by which time most infrastructure problems had
been resolved, the Treasury's regular issuance of bills met with strong demand,
driving stop-out rates to their lowest levels since 1961. The Treasury's cash
needs eased with the arrival of estimated quarterly personal income tax
payments, although individuals and firms affected by the disruption may defer
tax payments until January. The Treasury canceled debt buybacks scheduled for
September 20 and 27, but announced that buyback operations will resume next
month. Looking forward, the $40 billion of emergency funds approved by the
Congress, as well as the potential for other forthcoming "emergency" spending,
has boosted expectations for the Treasury's borrowing needs.
Agency Finance
Debt issuance by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was derailed only briefly by the
attacks. Reportedly, both were able to issue overnight discount notes as early as
the day after the attacks to cope with their immediate financing needs. Later
that week, Freddie Mac was able to issue longer-term Reference notes, which
elicited strong demand, and soon after, both agencies resumed their regularly
scheduled debt-issuance programs without problems.

State and Local Government Finance
Credit quality of the state and local sector appears not to have been significantly
impaired by the terrorist attacks. Bonds of the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey have been put on watch for a downgrade, as concerns have surfaced
about the effect of the attack on the authority's airport revenues. Other airport
authority bonds around the country have already begun to be downgraded, but
these bonds tend to be small. For the rest of the municipal sector, upgrades
continue to outnumber downgrades, although the pace of downgrades has picked
up.
Issuance of long-term tax-exempt securities slowed in September, following a
strong August, as refunding activity waned and the terrorist attacks disrupted the
market. The $12 billion issue expected from California to finance expenditures
related to its power crisis has been tied up in the approval process, and
California instead issued nearly $6 billion in short-term debt to bridge the gap.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 grew at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in August, continuing its deceleration
from the blistering pace of the first half of the year. But even before the terrorist
attacks, partial data for September suggested a return to double-digit growth.
Liquid deposits, which grew briskly in August, were on track for rapid growth in
September, owing to the decline in opportunity cost as rates fell. Payment
system disruptions after the attacks have further inflated M2 growth in
September by temporarily boosting both the demand and savings deposits
components of liquid deposits. This bulge accounts for nearly half of the
estimated M2 growth for September and is expected to run off in coming weeks.
Retail money market funds, whose weakness helped damp M2 growth in
August, snapped back in September, partly owing to the decline in equity
values.
Institutional money market fund flows, which had been slowing since June,
accelerated notably in early September and then surged following the
intermeeting easing as investors jumped into money funds to take advantage of
their slower adjustment to lower market rates.
Bank credit in August was about flat, as another month of strong growth in
adjusted securities offset continued declines in loans. Business loans contracted
in August, but at a slower pace than in previous months. While loan weakness
likely owes mostly to continued soft demand, it may also reflect tightened
supply conditions; in this regard, the August Survey of Terms of Business
Lending indicated that spreads on loans not made under commitment remain
elevated. The most recent data show that delinquencies on loans, especially
business loans, jumped higher in the second quarter, and the staff estimates that
C&I delinquencies continued to rise in the current quarter.

III-19
Growth of bank credit in September is estimated to have surged to a double-
digit rate, as transactions disruptions caused bank balance sheets to balloon for a
period following the attacks. With payment flows temporarily halted, a
substantial volume of overdrafts was created, lending to a spike in "other" loans.
Business loans were also boosted, apparently reflecting demands from
businesses that were unable to issue commercial paper and bonds. Although
most of the jump in C&I loans was reversed in the following week, on a month
average basis, business loan growth likely will be positive for September.
Contacts with several large banks by staff suggest that changes in the overall
business climate since the terrorist attacks have not yet affected standards for
C&I loans, but could if economic conditions continue to worsen. The banks
reported that borrowers in the most affected sectors were receiving heightened
scrutiny, and some of the banks reported that they had tightened terms. There
was also concern that loan demand continues to dissipate, although some banks
reported that weaker credits may be utilizing their existing credit lines.

Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $28.8 billion in July, little
changed from the $29.1 billion deficit (revised) recorded in June. However, the
level of both exports and imports dropped sharply. From December of last year
to July, exports of goods and services fell 6 percent and imports fell 8 percent,
reflecting the weak state of world-wide economic activity this year.

The value of exports was 2.5 percent lower in July than in June with the decline
spread among most trade categories, particularly machinery (high tech and
other), industrial supplies, and automotive products. A 12 percent annual rate
drop in exports in the second quarter marked the third consecutive quarter of
decline. Exports of semiconductors and other machinery accounted for most of
the decline. The value of exported industrial supplies also fell sharply. The
increase in exported automotive products in the second quarter was partly
reversed by the decline recorded in July.
The value of imports fell 2.1 percent in July with large declines in the value of
oil (both price and quantity), semiconductors, other machinery, automotive
products, and consumer goods. The 15 percent annual rate fall in imports in the
second quarter was the second consecutive quarter of decline. As in the case of
exports, the bulk of the import decline occurred in computers, semiconductors,
and other machinery. Imported industrial supplies and consumer goods both fell
sharply in the second quarter as well. The rise in imported automotive products
in the second quarter was largely reversed in July.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil The BLS price of imported oil rose a bit in August following a sharp drop
in July. For July-August combined, the price of imported oil fell 14 percent at
an annual rate, about the same rate of decline as in the second quarter and much
less than in the first quarter. Factors that placed downward pressures on oil
prices included the resumption of Iraqi oil exports, increased levels of oil
inventories, and signs of weak global demand. In response to these pressures,
OPEC agreed in late July to cut production targets 1 million barrels per day
beginning in September. Immediately following the terrorist attacks in the
United States on September 11, oil prices surged higher, but have since fallen
well below pre-attack levels as apprehensions about possible supply disruptions
gave way to concerns about weaker world oil demand and the increasing
difficulty OPEC will face in defending its price target. The spot price of West
Texas Intermediate has recently traded around $22 per barrel, more than $5 per
barrel below the August average.
Non-oil imports. Prices of imported non-oil goods (and core goods) declined
0.4 percent (not an annual rate) in August, following a much sharper decrease in
July. The decline in August was largely in prices of imported industrial supplies
(primarily unfinished metals but also paper) building materials, and chemicals.
For July-August combined, prices of imported core goods fell 5.9 percent at an
annual rate, about the same rate of decline as in the second quarter. As in the
second quarter, the drop in prices in July-August was led by decreases in prices
of imported industrial supplies with smaller price declines recorded in all other
major trade categories.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports (total and core) decreased 0.2 percent in
August, the seventh consecutive monthly decline. The fall in the price of core
goods in August was largely from industrial supplies (chemicals and metals).
For the third consecutive month, the price of exported capital goods (excluding
computers and semiconductors) was unchanged. For July-August combined, the
price of exported core goods declined 2 percent at an annual rate, a slightly
higher rate than recorded in the second quarter. A larger drop in prices of
exported industrial supplies in July-August than in the second quarter was only
partly offset by a swing from negative to positive in the price of agricultural
exports.
U.S. Current Account through 2001:Q2
In 2001:Q2, the U.S. current account deficit narrowed, for the second
consecutive quarter, to $426 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The
$21 billion decline resulted from a large drop in the deficit for trade in goods and
services that was only partly offset by small increases in the deficits in
investment income and other income and transfers.

IV-6
The trade deficit fell as the U.S. economic slowdown reduced imports more than
the foreign economic slowdown reduced exports. Income on investments also
reflected sagging global conditions, with the declines in income receipts on
U.S.-owned assets abroad (both portfolio and direct) slightly exceeding
decreases in income payments on foreign-owned assets in the United States.
Unilateral transfer payments rose slightly, primarily an increase in private
remittances and other private transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) slowed somewhat in July, but for the year
remain on pace to surpass last year's record level. The slowdown in July was
primarily due to a pickup in net sales of Treasury securities. Net purchases of
agency bonds and corporate bonds remained strong, but somewhat below recent
record amounts; in July, issuance of both types of bonds was low compared with
recent levels. Net purchases of equities have slowed in the past two months, but
remain at levels that are high by historical standards.
U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) were near zero in July, as net
sales of foreign bonds increased and there were no stock swaps. U.S. net
purchases of foreign equities held at near the first half s pace in July, although

IV-7
transactions in Japanese equities switched from significant net purchases to
small net sales.
Following a $20 billion decrease in the second quarter, foreign official assets
held in the United States (line 1) increased $10 billion in July. Increases were
widespread in the month and were only partly offset by decreases recorded by
Japan ($4 billion) and Argentina ($3 billion). For the year through July, foreign
official assets in the United States have declined $6 billion, with the largest
decline recorded for Japan ($14 billion). Partial data from the FRBNY show
that between end-July and mid-September, total foreign official holdings
increased $7 billion.'
The U.S. banking sector (line 3) recorded extremely modest net inflows in the
second quarter and in July, following a net outflow of $51 billion in the first
quarter.
Foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7) was strong in the second
quarter. Almost half of the $67 billion inflow was due to the takeover of
Voicestream Wireless by Deutsche Telekom. Going forward, however,
announced takeover deals are few, suggesting that merger-related inflows might
be at reduced levels in the second half of the year. U.S. direct investment abroad
(line 6) continued at about the same pace as past quarters, even though merger
activity was subdued.
The statistical discrepancy for the second quarter was negative $18 billion,
following a positive $8 billion discrepancy in the first quarter.
1. The split between foreign official and private capital flows has been clouded lately by
unusual transactions by China. In the second quarter, $10 billion in reported private Chinese
purchases of agency and Treasury bonds were reclassified as official purchases, because it is
suspected that securities purchased by Chinese government entities not classified as official are
being transferred to the official sector (Ministry of Finance and Central Bank) in a manner that
is not captured in the TIC reporting system.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against other major
currencies was little changed over the intermeeting period. Dollar appreciation
against several major currencies early in the period was reversed by market
reactions to the weak August U.S. employment data reported on September 7
and to the terrorist attacks of September 11. The dollar's exchange value against
the currencies of our other important trading partners rose almost 2 percent, on
balance, over the period; the dollar appreciated 4-1/2 percent on net against the
Mexican peso, 7-1/2 percent relative to the Brazilian real, and 3-1/2 percent vis-à-vis
the Chilean peso, as the economies of Latin America appeared particularly
vulnerable to the current slowdown in U.S. economic activity and to
repercussions from the attacks.

June July August September
Early in the period, the dollar appreciated against the European currencies after
the September 4 release of a stronger-than-expected reading of the U.S. NAPM
manufacturing index for August led market participants to surmise that U.S.
manufacturing output could be poised for a recovery. The dollar also
appreciated against the yen on indications that Japan's economy is contracting
and after Japan's sovereign debt rating was placed on credit watch by Moody's
on September 6. The following day, however, the release of the weaker-than-
expected U.S. employment report for August initiated a shift down of the

IV-10
exchange value of the dollar. While trading in global foreign exchange markets
did not come to a standstill in the days following the terrorist attacks, transaction
volume did decline substantially as a major component of the foreign exchange
trading infrastructure in New York was destroyed and as market participants
reported a wide-spread reluctance to trade. In recent days, the dollar has retraced
some of these post-attack losses, as prospects for a near-term immediate
engagement of U.S. military forces appear to have receded and as the Japanese
monetary authorities repeatedly purchased very large amounts of dollars for yen.
On balance, the dollar depreciated 1/2 and 3/4 percent, respectively, against the
euro and the yen over the intermeeting period. In contrast, the dollar appreciated
2 percent on net vis-à-vis the Canadian dollar, as investors appeared to react to
weakening growth prospects for Canada.

Following the FOMC's intermeeting cut in the federal funds rate on
September 17, the central banks of most foreign industrial countries acted to
ease rates and to provide liquidity at favorable terms. The Bank of Canada, the
European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the central banks of Sweden
and Denmark, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand all lowered their
respective policy rates by 50 basis points, and the Bank of England eased policy
by 25 basis points. The Bank of Japan announced an indefinite increase in

IV-11
current account balances above its current target of ¥6 trillion and lowered the
discount rate from 25 to 10 basis points. Justifying these changes, the central
banks mentioned the current weak outlook for global growth as well as the
uncertainties for financial market stability and consumer confidence created by
the terrorist attacks. The Federal Reserve set up temporary swap facilities with
the European Central Bank and the Bank of England and augmented its existing
swap arrangement with the Bank of Canada. The European Central Bank drew
on its facility to provide temporary dollar liquidity to financial institutions
operating in Europe. On September 24, the Swiss National Bank lowered the
target band for its policy rate an additional 50 basis points to counter upward
pressures on the exchange value of the Swiss franc.

In response to these developments, short-term market rates fell substantially in
most foreign industrial countries. However, yields on bellwether government
bonds declined only 19 basis points in Canada and 14 basis points in Australia,
were unchanged in Germany, and rose 4 to 6 basis points in the United Kingdom
and Japan, leading to marked steepenings of yield curves in all major industrial
countries.
Share prices fell sharply around the world, in industrial countries as well as in
emerging market economies, for broad indexes as well for indexes of the
technology, transportation, and insurance sectors, both in the days immediately
following the attacks when U.S. exchanges were closed, and after September 17
when U.S. bourses re-opened. On balance, broad equity indexes declined 12 to
18 percent in Europe and Japan over the intermeeting period, generally
outpacing equity price drops in the United States. Share prices fell more than
20 percent in Brazil and Argentina and are down in the 15-to-20-percent range
on several stock exchanges in East Asia.
Trading in emerging market debt came to a near standstill for several days
following the terrorist attacks, as important financial infrastructure installations
located in the World Trade Center were destroyed. After active trading in Brady
debt and global bonds resumed, their risk spreads jumped substantially. On
balance, the EMBI+ spreads of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are up between
100 and 230 basis points over the intermeeting period.

IV-13
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
GDP data for the foreign industrial economies confirm that growth ground to a
halt in the second quarter and more recent indicators, albeit for the period
preceding the September 11 terrorist attack, suggest that growth remained very
weak in the third quarter. In Japan, GDP fell sharply in the second quarter and
recent data are consistent with a sharp contraction in the third quarter as well,
with a slump in domestic activity being exacerbated by slowing global demand.
The deteriorating external environment has also contributed to a slowdown in
the euro area and in the United Kingdom, with manufacturing in both areas
being particularly weak. Canadian GDP was about flat in the second quarter, as
consumer spending slowed sharply; the worsening of employment conditions in
the third quarter point to further weakening.
With oil prices continuing to ease and economic slack increasing, consumer
price inflation has declined in recent months. The twelve-month rate of
consumer price inflation dropped below 3 percent in the euro area and Canada in
July and remained there in August. Retail price inflation in the United Kingdom
remained near the Bank of England's 2-1/2 percent target, while deflation
continued in Japan.
Against the background of deterioration in economic prospects even before
September 11, foreign central banks have accelerated the pace of monetary
easing in response to disruptions to financial markets and concerns about
plunging confidence in the aftermath of the attacks. The Bank of Canada and
the ECB each cut rates 25 basis points at their regular August policy meetings
and 50 basis points on September 17. The Bank of England joined in the easing
with a 25 basis-point rate cut the following day, while the Bank of Japan cut its
official discount rate and took other measures to increase liquidity.
Recent indicators for Japan suggest that the economy is in another recession.
Real GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the second quarter, and
indicators for the third quarter suggest a further decline. The second-quarter
decline was led by a steep drop in private investment, which subtracted about
3 percentage points from growth; business fixed investment fell roughly
11 percent, and residential investment dropped at a rate of about 30 percent.
Government investment also fell sharply as the impact of last year's
supplemental budget package began to fade, subtracting about 1-1/4 percentage
points from growth. Consumption spending showed surprising strength,
however, boosted in part by a rise in automobile sales. Both exports and imports
continued to fall, with net exports subtracting about 1/2 percentage point from
growth.

2. Percentage point contribution to GDP growth, s.a.a.r.
Recent data indicate a further contraction, with the all-industry index, a supply-
side proxy for GDP, falling 1.2 percent in July, led by a drop in industrial
production. On the demand side, shipments of machinery also registered a steep
decline in July, led by weaker demand in the electrical category that includes
high-tech equipment. Machinery orders, a leading indicator of business
investment, fell 1.6 percent in July, the third consecutive monthly drop.
Household spending also appears to be weakening, with July household
expenditures about unchanged from their second-quarter level, and new
passenger car registrations down about 2 percent over the same period.
Residential and nonresidential building starts both rebounded somewhat in July,
but the level of activity in the construction sector remains weak.
Labor market conditions have continued to deteriorate. The unemployment rate
hit a record 5 percent in July, with employment down about 1-1/2 percent from its
recent peak in November of last year. The job-offers-to-applicants ratio slipped
to 0.60, below its peak of 0.66 last December, although still well above its mid-
1999 trough of 0.46.

Prices have continued to decline. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 1.2 percent in August
from a year earlier. Deflation in wholesale prices for domestic goods has
intensified as the impact of the earlier run-up in energy prices has faded, with
prices in August down 0.9 percent from a year earlier. Recent data from the
National Land Agency showed a decline of 4.1 percent in average land prices in
the twelve months to July, a little more than the 3.6 percent decline recorded in
the preceding year. The GDP deflator in the second quarter was a little more
than 1 percent (n.s.a.) below its year-earlier level.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) shrank about 7 percent
on average in July and August from its second-quarter level, as the fall in
exports continued to outpace the decline in imports.

On September 18, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a number of measures to
ease monetary policy. The BOJ said that it would maintain the level of the
outstanding balance of banks' deposits held at the central bank above the current
target of ¥6 trillion for the time being. Since September 11, the BOJ has kept
the balance between ¥8 trillion and ¥11 trillion to provide ample liquidity to the
banking system. The BOJ also cut the official discount rate from 25 to 10 basis
points, and increased the maximum time period for this Lombard-type facility
from 5 to 10 business days during the current reserve period (through October
15). There was no change in the amount of outright purchases of government
securities.
Shortly after second-quarter GDP figures were released on September 7, Prime
Minister Koizumi directed his Cabinet to put together a supplemental budget for
this fiscal year, with the focus on labor market programs, not on public works.
Koizumi's pledge to hold new annual debt issuance to ¥30 trillion beginning this
fiscal year would allow room for a supplemental budget of at most ¥2 trillion,
but political pressures for a larger package are mounting.
Data confirm that economic growth in the euro area slowed significantly in the
second quarter, with real GDP rising only 0.2 percent (s.a.a.r.). Consumption
expenditures remained fairly strong, increasing 2.4 percent in the second quarter
and 2.8 percent for the first half of 2001. Fixed investment spending weakened
notably, declining 3.2 percent after registering essentially no change in the first
quarter. Net exports subtracted more than l percentage point from second-
quarter growth as a decline in imports was more than offset by a sharp fall in
exports. Real GDP in Germany declined 0.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second
quarter, with investment being especially weak, while Italian GDP was also
about flat. French GDP increased 1 percent, as consumer spending slowed from
a rapid pace in the first quarter and investment declined slightly.
Recent data suggest that activity remained weak in the third quarter. Euro-area
industrial production declined 1.4 percent in July. The euro-area purchasing
managers' surveys for the manufacturing sector edged up in August but
remained below the threshold that indicates a contraction in manufacturing.
Service sector purchasing managers' surveys have been little changed on balance
over the past several months, indicating expansion of activity, but at a
considerably slower pace than earlier this year. Euro-area industrial confidence
declined further in July, largely reflecting more negative opinions on orders.
German manufacturing orders fell 1.5 percent in July, as a decline in foreign
orders offset a modest improvement in domestic orders.

Prior to the terrorist attacks, some euro area confidence indicators had edged up
somewhat, providing some hope that business conditions had stabilized. In July,
the German Ifo index edged up for the first time since January, reflecting a
modest improvement in the expectations component for the first time since last
October. In August, the Ifo index edged down again reflecting further erosion in
the current conditions component. About one-fourth of Ifo responses were
received after September 11, but these responses were not notably more
pessimistic than those received prior to that date. However, the German ZEW
indicator, which is derived from a financial market survey, showed a noticeable
difference in responses, with an improvement in sentiment in responses received
before the attacks, and a deterioration among responses received after September
11. The French INSEE monthly business survey fell in September to its lowest
level in five years, primarily on a more pessimistic view for foreign orders. The
decline was larger than expected, as only 1/5 of the responses were received
after September 11. The ISAE Italian consumer confidence index rose slightly

significant, though limited, decline.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole have yet to show much
deterioration, as the harmonized unemployment rate edged down to 8.3 percent
in June and remained at that rate in July. National statistics, however, show a
small rise in the French unemployment rate in July, and an increase in the
number of unemployed in Germany since year end.
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation edged down to
2.7 percent in August, but remained above the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.
Core consumer price inflation (which excludes food, energy, alcohol and

IV-19
tobacco) remained 2.1 percent on a twelve-month basis, but the twelve-month
rate of change in producer prices, which peaked at 6.7 percent last October, has
moved down steadily this year to 2.5 percent in July.
On August 30, the European Central Bank reduced its official interest rates
25 basis points, noting lower inflationary pressures and an expectation that euro-
area real GDP growth would most likely be lower than expected a few months
ago. On September 17, the ECB cut official rates an additional 50 basis points,
bringing the minimum bid rate for the main refinancing tender to 3.75 percent.
Real GDP growth in the United Kingdom slowed from near trend in the first
quarter of 2001 to 1.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter. Total domestic
demand grew 2.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter as strong growth in fixed
investment, consumption expenditures, and government consumption more than
offset a decline in inventories that subtracted nearly 4 percentage points from
growth. Net exports had a negligible effect on growth, as both imports and
exports contracted sharply.

Indicators for the third quarter paint a mixed picture. Consumer confidence
moved up in July to its highest level in over a year, and retail sales continued to
show strong gains. On the other hand, industrial production fell 0.5 percent in
July, business confidence dropped sharply in August, and surveys of expected

IV-20
future production in the manufacturing sector remain pessimistic. Recent surveys
of the service sector are consistent with growth slowing in the third quarter.
Notwithstanding the recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in
August, the lowest rate in 26 years, while the labor force survey measure of the
unemployment rate remained at a record low of 5 percent for the three months
centered in June.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
payments) rose to 2.6 percent in August -- slightly above the Bank of England's
official target of 2.5 percent, as gasoline and oil prices fell more slowly and the
increase in food prices picked up. In July, growth in average earnings fell below
the 4-1/2 percent rate (from year earlier) that the Bank of England believes to be
compatible with its inflation target.

On September 18, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of
England voted to lower the official repo rate 25 basis points to 4.75 percent. The
repo rate has been cut five times, totaling 125 basis points, since the beginning of
this year. In its statement of September 18, the MPC cited the recent cuts by
other central banks, the sharp declines in stock prices, and concerns about
consumer confidence.
In Canada, real GDP grew only 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter,
following a downwardly revised 2.0 percent gain in the first quarter. Consumer
spending growth slowed sharply, suggesting that worsening employment
conditions are beginning to restrain the household sector, previously the main
support for Canadian growth. In contrast, business fixed investment rebounded
in the second quarter, and inventory accumulation contributed about
3/4 percentage point to GDP growth, after two quarters of negative inventory
adjustment. The rise in business investment spurred machinery imports, pushing
import growth back into positive territory, while exports continued to fall, mainly
as a result of weak external demand for telecommunications equipment and
energy products. A decline in telecommunication equipment manufacturing led
to a fall in industrial capacity utilization to 83.2 percent in the second quarter,
marking the fourth consecutive quarterly decrease.

Indicators for the third quarter have tended to be weak. Both retail and wholesale
sales fell in July. Among retailers, gasoline stations registered the most severe
drop in sales. Exports declined in July, reflected primarily in the automotive and
energy sectors, while imports were flat, as an increase in the importation of oil-
drilling machinery offset decreases in automotive imports. Manufacturing
shipments edged down in July. Canada's unemployment rate increased in August
to 7.2 percent, the highest level since September 1999, owing to small job losses
along with a rise in labor force participation. However, part-time employment
more than accounted for the decline in overall employment, with full-time
employment rising somewhat. Housing starts provided a positive note, posting a
stronger-than-expected increase in August. Low vacancy rates, low inventories
of unoccupied housing, and falling mortgage rates have contributed to the relative
strength of the housing sector.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation increased slightly to 2.8
percent in August from 2.6 percent in July. The increase reflected a rise in
energy prices over the year. The twelve-month rate excluding food and energy
prices was 2.2 percent.
The Bank of Canada has lowered its policy rate, the Bank Rate, a total of 225
basis points this year, most recently by 50 basis points on September 17. The
Bank Rate now stands at 3.75 percent. The September 17 announcement
underscored the Bank's concern that the terrorist attacks on the United States
may pose significant challenges to consumer and business confidence in the
United States, Canada, and elsewhere.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Reports on economic conditions throughout the major developing countries were
generally unfavorable over the past month. In Latin America, internal economic
problems continued to plague Argentina and spilled over onto Brazil. More
generally, weakness in the United States weighed on the economies of the
region, particularly Mexico. In Asia, poor performance in the global high-tech
industry depressed exports further, and most countries have recently experienced
negative or slowing growth.
There is little macroeconomic data, as of yet, from the period after the terrorist
attacks on the United States. Financial indicators, however, suggest that
developing country economies will be adversely affected. In particular,
following the attacks on September 11, developing country stock markets
plunged and have just started to recover on the back of gains in the U.S. market.
The prospects of weaker U.S. growth and the desire for "safe haven"
investments has put downward pressure on some developing country exchange
rates. Brazil seems to have suffered the most, with the real declining 4-1/2 percent
since the terrorist attacks.
Economic indicators for Argentina have continued to weaken, on balance, since
the last Greenbook. GDP for the second quarter showed a surprising rise of
1.1 percent at an annual rate, but indicators for the third quarter are down.
Industrial production fell considerably in August, and data for previous months
were revised lower. Other indicators such as supermarket sales, shopping center
sales, and construction also plunged in August. Consumer prices declined
1.3 percent during the year ended August, and consumer confidence, measured
prior to September 11, diminished sharply in early September. A continuing
pattern of flat or rising exports and falling imports generated an $8.7 billion
trade surplus in July and contributed to a substantial improvement in the current
account deficit in the second quarter. The federal government reported a slight
budget surplus in August but it still appears that reaching the IMF fiscal targets
for the year will be difficult.
Turmoil in the financial sector and sizable deposit and reserve outflows during
July and August boosted market fears of default. The IMF announced an
$8 billion augmentation to the country's current program on August 21. Total
IMF funding available under the program now stands at almost $22 billion. The
augmentation included $5 billion that was approved for disbursement on
September 7-$4 billion to the central bank to shore up reserves and $1 billion to
the Argentine treasury-and a further $3 billion to be disbursed in conjunction
with a yet-to-be announced voluntary exchange of Argentine sovereign debt. An

IV-27
additional $1.3 billion from the original Fund program was also disbursed in
early September.
Financial conditions improved slightly after the announcement of additional IMF
funds in mid-August. Spreads on sovereign debt, as measured by JP Morgan's
EMBI+ index, dropped 200 basis points and then fluctuated between 1400 and
1500 basis points until the September 11 attacks. Rates then moved back up to
around 1600 basis points. Since August 21, deposit outflows have stabilized,
and total deposits are up about $1-1/2 billion. However, the level of deposits
remains 11 percent below that of end June. Domestic interest rates have come
down since mid-August but are still elevated, with the 30-day interest rate on
peso deposits at 22 percent as of late-September. Rates are unlikely to decline
much further, if at all, until after October 14, when Argentina holds elections for
all of the seats in the senate and half those in the lower house. Finally, the
Argentine stock market has fallen 15 percent since the terrorist attacks, and is
now at its lowest level in a decade.

In Mexico, recent data releases suggest that the economy continues to be hard hit
by the slowdown in the United States. Second-quarter real GDP growth marked
the third consecutive quarter of decline. Moreover, private consumption-the
only component of expenditure that had held up relatively well-decelerated
significantly in the second quarter. Data so far in the third quarter point to
continued weakness. Industrial production fell in July and exports in July and

IV-28
August were below the second-quarter level. Twelve-month consumer price
inflation remained around 6 percent in August, under the government's year-end
inflation target of 6-1/2 percent.
The economic recession has put a dent in government revenues, and the fiscal
deficit widened in July, notwithstanding efforts to reduce expenditures.
Although new cuts have been announced, concern has mounted that, if the trend
of weak revenues continues, the government may overshoot this year's fiscal
deficit target of 0.65 percent of GDP. The deterioration of the fiscal situation
has further focused attention on the importance of tax reform in Mexico,
including the need to reduce Mexico's excessive dependence on oil income as a
source of government revenue.
Mexican financial markets have reacted adversely following the terrorist attacks
in the United States on September 11. The Mexican equity market was most
affected-dropping over 9 percent since the incident. The effect on the peso and
short-term interest rates was more muted, with a slight increase in interest rates
and a depreciation of roughly 2-1/4 percent of the peso since the attack.

In Brazil, data released since the last Greenbook point to further weakening.
Industrial production fell in July for the fifth straight month. The urban
unemployment rate in July was unchanged, reflecting mostly an exit of workers
from the labor force. Inflation declined in August, bringing the twelve-month
increase in the CPI to 6.3 percent. The weakening economy seems to have
contributed to an improvement in the trade balance in August, as imports were
up only slightly while exports jumped. The stronger trade figures contributed to
a significant narrowing of the current account deficit in August. Fiscal data for
July indicate that Brazil remains on track to meet its IMF program targets-the
primary surplus was larger than expected, although high interest costs weighed
heavily on the overall deficit.

Brazilian asset prices had already come under downward pressure in response to
deteriorating conditions in Argentina, but were struck especially hard by the
terrorist attacks on September 11. Since September 10, the Bovespa has
plummeted almost 18 percent and the real reached an all-time low of 2.83 reais
per dollar on September 21. The central bank responded with concerted
intervention sales and large sales of dollar-linked bonds and has held its
benchmark overnight interest rate at 19 percent rather than lower it in tandem
with other countries. These actions have reversed some of the currency's
depreciation but it is still down 7 percent since the last Greenbook.

On September 14, the IMF Executive Board approved the previously-announced
$15.6 billion program for Brazil, paving the way for the release of $4.6 billion.
While the Brazilian government had earlier indicated that it would not
necessarily withdraw the money, in light of recent events, market analysts now
see it as more likely that Brazil will draw on the IMF funds.
The Venezuelan recovery appears to have slowed in the past several months, as
the price of oil declined. GDP growth has moderated since last year, although
the unemployment rate continued to fall, dropping to 13.3 percent in June, and
consumer price inflation has been edging up in recent months, after four years of
declines. The past month has seen an outflow of more than $1 billion in foreign
reserves, amid mounting fears of capital controls or devaluation. In response,
the central bank has undertaken a variety of measures including selling short-
term certificates of deposits, raising the discount rate, and selling dollars. Since
September 10, the spread on Venezuelan foreign currency sovereign debt has
risen about 100 basis points, and the domestic stock market has fallen 7 percent,
mostly reflecting uncertainty regarding world demand for oil.

In Korea, real GDP growth remained slightly positive in the second quarter, but
recent indicators suggest that growth may be slipping into negative territory in
the third quarter. Industrial production declined for the fourth consecutive
month in July. July's decline was broadbased. Previously, weakness had been
concentrated in the high-tech sectors. The rate of capacity utilization dropped to
its lowest level in nearly three years in July, and the inventory-to-sales ratio

IV-31
continued to move up sharply. Investment in manufacturing facilities, which
tends to be strongly influenced by trends in exports, fell sharply in July, while
construction investment remained fairly robust. Indicators of business
confidence have turned down in recent months after moving up, on balance, in
the first half of the year.
In response to evidence of further weakening in economic activity, the
government stated in late August that it planned to supplement previously
announced spending measures with a reduction in tax rates. The government
indicated that its goal was to reduce income taxes by an average of 15 percent
for wage earners and 10 percent for private business owners. The central bank
decided at its regular monthly meeting in early September to keep interest rates
unchanged but, following the terrorist attacks on the United States, announced a
50 basis point reduction in its target for the overnight rate, to 4 percent. The
Korean won has depreciated 1-1/4 percent since September 10.

Second-quarter data for the ASEAN region suggest that the countries with the
greatest concentration of high-tech production, Singapore and Malaysia, have
been hardest hit by the global downturn in electronics, while economies with
more diverse exports have held up somewhat better. Malaysian real GDP fell
precipitously, in line with Singapore's previously reported decline. Both
countries saw industrial production rise in July, after several consecutive months
of weakness, but the August production figure for Singapore turned down again,
falling over 3 percent. In contrast, Thailand and, especially, the Philippines

IV-32
reported positive real GDP growth for the second quarter. In both countries, the
growth was due to a pickup in consumption after the resolution of some of the
political uncertainties that had plagued the first quarter. For the most part, the
ASEAN countries have been able to maintain their trade surpluses, despite the
slowdown in the global economy. Inflation edged down slightly in the region.
Following the September 11 attacks, stock markets in the ASEAN countries
have fallen between 10 and 17 percent while exchange rates have been fairly
stable, with the exception of the Indonesian rupiah which is down 6-1/2 percent
since the attack.

In China, recent indicators point to a continued moderation in growth.
Industrial production rose 8.1 percent in August from its year-earlier level, well
below the pace reported in the first half of the year. In August, retail sales grew
9.6 percent from a year earlier, down from the first two quarters of this year.
The global economic slowdown has led to some tapering off of foreign direct
investment, with indicators implying further declines in the near term. In
response to weaker consumer demand and FDI, the government increased
spending on infrastructure. Fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises
surged over 21 percent in August compared with the same month last year.
Consistent with slowing consumer demand, consumer prices rose only 1 percent
in August from twelve months earlier, a bit lower than in previous months.
Following the sharp declines registered earlier in the year, imports jumped
sharply in August, while exports posted their third month of slow growth,
resulting in China's first trade deficit in more than five years.

Data received since the last FOMC meeting suggest that Hong Kong has slipped
into recession. GDP fell 6.6 percent in the second quarter; first quarter GDP
growth was revised down to zero from over 1 percent. The volume of retail
sales in July was about 6 percent below the June level, and the unemployment
rate increased to 4.9 percent in the June-August period. Exports were up slightly
in July and August from their second-quarter average, but still remain well
below their average level in the first quarter, reflecting a falloff in electronics
exports. Consumer prices fell 1.2 percent over the twelve months ended August,
a steeper drop than in the previous two months.

Indicators released over the past month confirm that Taiwan is in recession. In
the second quarter, GDP plummeted over 10 percent (s.a.a.r.), and recent data
suggest that economic activity has continued to decline in the third quarter.
While the volatile industrial production series jumped in August following a
decline in July, other reports were more negative. Exports declined almost
4-1/2 percent in August on the heels of an 8.7 percent drop in July, owing to
sagging global demand for electronics and information technology products.
Imports fell a dramatic 14.3 percent for August, implying very weak demand,
especially for imported inputs. In addition, the unemployment rate for August
now stands almost half a percentage point below the second quarter average.
Consumer prices increased slightly in August from year earlier levels. Taiwan's
central bank cut key interest rates-which were already at record
lows-1/2 percentage point on September 18. The bank cited Taiwan's weakening
economy and record high unemployment for the cut, and also made reference to
the terrorist attacks on the United States.
Across Greater China, stock markets plunged in the wake of the terrorist attacks,
while exchange rates were little affected.
