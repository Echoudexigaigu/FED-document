Board of Governors of the Federal Reserv e System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensiv e digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain.  
Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a re daction process that removed information obtained on a

scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Real GDP edged down at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in the third quarter after
posting a slight increase in the second quarter, and most indicators suggest that
aggregate activity is contracting early in the fourth quarter.' Initial claims for
unemployment insurance have risen to levels usually associated with a
significant decline in payroll employment, and anecdotes as well as available
data point to another sharp drop in factory output in October. Demand looks
soft, but just how soft is difficult to say; some of the extraordinary weakness in
the September data on retail sales and new orders for capital goods likely was
temporary, as is the phenomenal surge in vehicle sales that seems to have taken
place in October.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market surveys for September were little affected by the attacks of
September 11. Even so, they showed further deterioration of labor demand.
Although the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent that month after
having jumped in August, private nonfarm payroll employment fell 196,000,
and aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers dropped
0.3 percent.2 The decline in payroll employment in September was spread more
widely than in preceding months: While manufacturing and the related
industries of wholesale trade and help supply continued to shed jobs, substantial
losses also occurred in retail trade and services. From the second quarter to the
third quarter, the average unemployment rate rose from 4.5 percent to
4.8 percent, and aggregate hours paid fell at an annual rate of 3.1 percent.
Initial claims for unemployment insurance actually fell during the week ending
on September 15, possibly because potential claimants postponed filing for
benefits in the wake of the tragedy. But claims then moved back up to around
450,000 the following week and spiked to 535,000 in the week ending on
September 29. Claims during that week were especially high in New York and
Virginia and in states with large tourist industries, suggesting that much of the
1. The third-quarter NIPA data were released on October 31, the same day that the
Greenbook went to print. Additional detail will be released on November 1 and will be
discussed in the Supplement.
2. The week of September 11 was the reference week for both the establishment and
household surveys. However, because the employment concepts in both surveys refer to work
paid or performed during any part of the week (and often longer in the establishment survey),
none of the measures of employment or unemployment in September appear to have been
significantly affected by the terrorist attacks. In the establishment survey, the average workweek
was little affected, as the survey measures hours paid rather than hours worked, and many
workers were paid for lost hours during the week of September 11. In the household survey, the
number of persons who reported working part time that week for economic reasons rose
25 percent, probably because of disruptions in business activity caused by the attacks. (In the
household survey, the question refers to hours worked rather than hours paid.)

increase may have been fallout from the attacks. Since then, claims have edged
off but have remained near 500,000 per week-well above the levels that
prevailed before September 11.3 At the same time, the insured unemployment
rate has continued to rise over the past month, reaching a high of 2.8 percent for
the week ending on October 13.
Reports of job losses have been widespread in recent weeks. Since September
11, we have counted announcements of job losses or other reductions in staff
totaling 348,000 jobs.4 Admittedly, the connection between such
announcements and monthly changes in payroll employment typically is
tenuous.5 However, many of the nearly 120,000 job reductions we have counted
in the airline and hotel industries probably occurred in time to be measured in
the October employment report. (Of course, we expect the payroll survey also
to record many job reductions beyond those two industries.)
Other indicators underscore the perception that labor markets have continued to
deteriorate. The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising edged
down in September, and the percentage of employers surveyed by the National
Federation of Independent Business reporting difficulty in filling positions
retraced its August increase in September and moved lower again in October. In
the Conference Board survey of consumer attitudes, households' views of
employment conditions continued to worsen in October.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its initial estimate of productivity for
the third quarter on November 7. Based on the NIPA data released October 31
and the data on hours published to date, we estimate that output per hour in the
nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of roughly 2-1/2 percent in
the third quarter of 2001. Over the four quarters ended last quarter, we estimate
that productivity rose 1-3/4 percent, about 2 percentage points less than the
increase recorded over the previous four quarters.
3. Initial claims have been running a bit higher when measured using the FRB seasonal
adjustment procedure, but the pattern of increase has been similar.
4. These data are compiled by the staff from news reports.
5. One reason for the weakness of the connection is that the timing of the announced
reductions is typically vague; many occur months after the announcement, and some may not
occur at all.

Industrial Production
Industrial production fell 1 percent in September after declining 0.7 percent in
August. In September, production dropped in most market groups and
industries, and the three-month diffusion index fell to 29.4, a level only slightly
above the low reached in the 1990-91 recession. Motor vehicle assemblies
stepped down 400,000 units after a similar reduction in August, and the
production of high-technology goods fell 2.4 percent. Production in other
manufacturing industries dropped 0.8 percent in September. In total, the
cumulative drop in industrial output over the past year was 5.8 percent, and the
overall factory operating rate in September reached 73.8 percent, the lowest
reading since May 1983.6
Available indicators suggest that production is likely to post a sizable drop in
October. Real adjusted durable goods orders plunged in September, and
anecdotal reports suggest that conditions for manufacturers have worsened since
September 11. In addition, most weekly production measures are down for the
6. The steep fall in utilization of the high-tech sector accounts for only part of the drop in
the overall operating rate; excluding that sector, capacity utilization declined to 75.1 percent, the
lowest reading since July 1983.

Production has fallen this past month in every industry for which weekly data
are available except petroleum refining, which had dropped sharply in
September because of a huge decline in the output of jet fuel. Production of
both raw steel and steel products is down around 7 percent so far in October in
response to continued import competition and falling demand.8 An October
decline in the number of oil rigs in operation continued the slide that has been
evident since late spring. The output of two construction materials, lumber and
plywood, also fell.

In the motor vehicle industry, automakers had anticipated a slowdown in sales
in the second half of this year and accordingly scheduled a step-down in fourth-
quarter production. Even with an apparent October surge in vehicle sales,
automakers remain wary about the future path of sales, and they have trimmed
production further in October by temporarily closing several plants. These
shutdowns, along with weekly data in hand, suggest that motor vehicle

assemblies slipped to a 10-3/4 million unit annual pace in October; relative to
schedules at the beginning of the month, this is an underbuild of about 4 percent.
Current schedules for the last two months of the fourth quarter average nearly
11-1/2 million units (annual rate), but in our view the risk that schedules might
be revised down outweighs the upside risk at this point.

In the high-tech area, conditions in the semiconductor industry remain weak.
According to the Semiconductor Industry Association, capital spending by chip
makers in 2001 is now likely to be 40 percent below the 2000 level; at midyear,
the forecast was for a 25 percent to 30 percent decline. New orders for
equipment by semiconductor manufacturers fell 11 percent in September after
having been flat since May. The weakness in the semiconductor industry is
attributable, in part, to the poor performance in downstream industries, such as
communications equipment and computers. According to Dataquest, personal
computer (PC) sales for the third quarter fell 9.2 percent (not at an annual rate,
FRB seasonals).9 Since the fourth quarter of last year, PC sales have declined
18.7 percent.
After September 11, manufacturers apparently became markedly more
pessimistic about their prospects. By our count, manufacturing firms announced
job losses totaling 103,000 in October, compared with 61,700 in September and
9. Most desktop PCs sold in the United States are assembled here.

II-11
only 43,600 in August. In the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Business
Outlook Survey for October, the diffusion indexes for new orders and
employment fell sharply. Responding to a special question, more than half of
the respondents in that survey reported that new orders fell after September 11.
In a survey conducted by the National Association of Business Economists
during early October, 14 percent of goods producers expected sales to increase
moderately for the remainder of the year; 38 percent expected no change;
38 percent expected sales to fall moderately; and 10 percent expected sales to
fall markedly. That survey also indicated that since September 11, 43 percent of
goods producers have lowered their expectations about sales for the remainder
of the year, compared with 5 percent that raised their sales expectations.
Consumer Spending
Real personal consumption expenditures rose at an annual rate of 1-1/4 percent
in the third quarter. Retail sales data indicate that outlays on goods likely
dropped sharply in September, thereby offsetting moderate increases in the
previous two months; spending on services appears to have declined as well.10
The pace of light vehicle sales apparently surged to near-record levels in
October. However, available indicators and anecdotal reports suggest that non-
auto spending was quite soft for the month.
The third-quarter gain in real PCE reflected relatively modest increases in each
of the major spending categories-durable goods, nondurable goods, and
services. Within the services category, third-quarter outlays on transportation
and recreation services declined last quarter, likely because of September drops
in spending on airline travel and other items affected by the attacks of
September 11. Meanwhile, real disposable income surged at an annual rate of
12-3/4 percent in the third quarter because of a significant decrease in net tax
payments and a sharp drop in energy prices." The personal saving rate jumped
2-3/4 percentage points last quarter.
In the aftermath of the events of September 11, the major automakers, led by
General Motors, offered reduced financing rates, and sales of vehicles have
surged since late September.12 Based on confidential industry estimates, sales of
light vehicles in October are expected to be at least 19-1/2 million units (annual
10. The monthly detailed data on personal consumption expenditures will not be available
until November 1.
11. In particular, households received rebates in the third quarter worth $140 billion at an
annual rate and benefited from $13-3/4 billion in reduced withholding associated with lower
marginal tax rates. Regarding energy prices, the PCE price index for energy plunged at an
annual rate of nearly 21 percent in the third quarter, holding down overall PCE inflation by about
1 percentage point.
12. The incentives do not apply to consumer leases. The new financing rates typically
include zero percent financing for thirty-six month loans and reduced rates for longer-term loans.
Several other firms, including Toyota, have introduced similar, but more limited, programs.

rate), with a spike in retail sales likely to more than account for the overall gain.
The consumer response to the incentives has far exceeded automakers'
expectations. Nonetheless, producers also believe that much of the jump in
demand likely has been shifted from future months, and sales are expected to
fall sharply after these special financing rates expire. The special financing
plans are currently set to expire by November 20, but other types of incentives
will still be available.
Outside of reports from motor vehicle producers, available indicators present a
mixed picture regarding consumer spending in October. According to the Bank
of Tokyo/Mitsubishi (BTM), weekly chain store sales fell back in the fourth
week of October after having turned up slightly in the middle of the month.
Many retailers indicated to BTM that sales for the month were likely to come in
"below plan." In addition, the latest readings from around the country suggest
that moderate temperatures in October could result in a slight decline in real
outlays on energy services. On the plus side, physical product data from the
Department of Energy point to a 2-1/4 percent rise in real consumer purchases
of gasoline in October after a drop of almost 3-1/2 percent in September. In
addition, stock market volumes rose even higher in October than in September,
indicating another increase in real PCE for brokerage services.
The most recent report from the University of Michigan Survey Research Center
(SRC) suggests that the attitudes of consumers have been fairly resilient in the
aftermath of September 11: After having registered a sharp decline in
September, the headline consumer sentiment indexes ticked up in October. By
contrast, the Conference Board's (CB) index of consumer confidence fell
sharply in October after having posted an even larger decline in the previous
month. Looking back over a longer time frame, however, both indexes have
retreated substantially over the past year, and their October levels were below
their respective long-run averages. Regarding labor-market expectations, both
the SRC and CB surveys indicate that consumers anticipate further deterioration
in the coming months.
Housing Markets
Housing activity appears to have been softening before September 11-albeit to
a level that remains comparatively high-and may have weakened further since
then. Although single-family starts edged up in September to an annual rate of
1.27 million units, adjusted permits for single-family construction dropped
5-3/4 percent, to about the same level as in June and July of last year. The ratio
of starts to the statistically more reliable permits series was noticeably above its
long-run average in September, suggesting that starts will drop back in the
fourth quarter. After September 11, contracts with suppliers and subcontractors
likely gave builders only limited flexibility with regard to home construction
planned for the balance of the month. But builders could easily have postponed
applying for additional building permits. For the third quarter as a whole,

single-family starts were only about 1 percent below the average for the first
half of this year.
Sales of new homes, which have been trending down from extraordinarily high
levels earlier in the year, edged still lower in September, to an annual rate of
864,000 units. Sales of existing homes dropped 11-3/4 percent, to a 4.9 million
unit pace in September after a record high sales pace in August. Although some
of the decline in existing home sales may reflect postponement of closings in
the wake of the terrorist attacks, the inherent lag in existing home sales suggests
that the number of sales contracts signed likely was falling before September
11.13 In addition, increases in both the repeat-sales price index for existing
homes and the constant-quality price index for new homes moderated in the
third quarter.
Our more timely indicators of housing demand have continued to show signs of
softening in recent weeks on balance. In the Michigan Survey, the October
reading on households' attitudes toward homebuying remained quite favorable,
a result partly reflecting a further decline in mortgage rates to a level near their
thirty-year lows. However, builders' rating of new home sales fell in October to
the lowest level since early 1996, and the four-week moving average for the
Mortgage Bankers Association index of purchase applications for home
mortgages dropped to the lowest level in two years.
Moreover, builders themselves may be turning more cautious. In a survey of
360 builders conducted in the first ten days of October by the National
Association of Home Builders, one-third indicated that they had reduced the
number of housing starts planned for the fourth quarter of this year, and one-
fourth reported that they had lowered the number of starts planned for the first
half of next year; the magnitude of these intended reductions is not known.14
In the multifamily sector, starts rose 6-1/4 percent in September, to an annual
rate of 306,000 units, but they still were 9-1/2 percent below the average for the
first eight months of this year. For the third quarter as a whole, multifamily
starts averaged 321,000 units, down nearly 6 percent from the average during
the two preceding quarters. Multifamily starts were well in line with adjusted
permits in September.
13. Existing home sales are recorded primarily on the basis of closings; hence, the sales
series lags changes in housing market conditions by about a month. However, according to the
National Association of Realtors, as many as 15 percent of sales ordinarily are closed within the
first two weeks after a contract is signed, and about 28 percent are closed within three weeks.
14. The results of the latest NAHB survey differ from a much smaller sampling conducted
on September 19 and 20 that was reported in the September Greenbook. The earlier NAHB
survey found that most builders were not making major changes to their plans over the next one
or two quarters.

Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real outlays for equipment and software fell at an
annual rate of 11-3/4 percent in the third quarter and appear to be headed for an
even sharper decline this quarter. New orders for nondefense capital goods
excluding aircraft plunged 9 percent in September after a 3/4 percent decline in
August. New orders in all high-tech sectors fell in September, with orders for
communications equipment extraordinarily weak; orders fell in almost every
category outside of the high-tech sector as well. Meanwhile, shipments of
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell 3.9 percent in September.
Shipments for computers and related equipment were among the few
components that increased in September, but that rise followed a large decline
in August. The level of new orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding
aircraft) has been running below the level of shipments since January, and as a
result, the backlog of unfilled orders has moved below its level of a year ago.
Although some of the observed decline in orders and shipments likely reflects
the pause in activity immediately following September 11, these data signal an
underlying weakness that probably is greater than we had previously thought.
This pessimism about investment spending is borne out by recent surveys of
businesses. According to the Conference Board survey of chief executive
officers (CEOs) completed before September 11, business confidence was
deteriorating in the third quarter. Nearly 50 percent of CEOs reported that they
had scaled back spending plans, and more than 20 percent expected conditions
to worsen in the next six months. Furthermore, in the October NABE survey,
about two-thirds of respondents to this survey reported reduced sales
expectations after the September 11 attacks.15 Moreover, more businesses
reported that they plan to cut capital spending than plan to increase spending
over the next year, and more than one-third of respondents have revised
downward their capital spending plans since July.
In the aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus recently revised down their production
schedules in light of reduced demand by air carriers. Boeing plans to reduce
production in the first half of next year, and deliveries in 2002 may fall to a low
of 350 planes. In the near-term, Boeing says that deliveries for 2001 could
number 522 planes, about the same as thought at the time of the last Greenbook
but well below anticipations as of early September. Airbus has cut its
announced target for deliveries in 2002 from 375 planes to around 330 planes,
and company officials conjectured that Airbus deliveries may drop even lower,
to around 300.
15. This survey covers firms in the manufacturing, transportation, utilities, communications,
financial services, and other services industries.

Business demand for motor vehicles is expected to plunge this quarter. Fleet
sales have been hit hard by the effects of the terrorist attacks. In particular,
demand from rental car companies has plummeted as airline travel for both
business and personal use has fallen dramatically. In addition, consumer leases,
which are included in business spending and are not eligible for the special
financing packages, are expected to drop sharply as consumers, instead, take
advantage of the latest purchasing incentives. Meanwhile, orders for medium
and heavy trucks remain depressed, and backlogs are quite low. These factors,
along with concerns about the overall economy in the aftermath of the events of
September 11, suggest that declines in sales of medium and heavy trucks, which
began in late 1999, will continue in the near term.
Nonresidential construction. Real outlays for nonresidential construction
were reported to have decreased at an annual rate of 12 percent in the third
quarter, about the same rate of decline as in the second quarter. However, the
published data were boosted by the lease of the World Trade Center (WTC) in
July from the Port Authority of New York to two private companies; excluding
this special factor, private construction spending would have shown a decline of
25 percent last quarter.16 The July and August data for construction spending
suggest that the declines were most likely a reflection of an accelerating
contraction in expenditures for office buildings and other commercial structures.
The vacancy rate for office buildings rose to 12.3 percent in the third quarter
from 10.8 percent in the second quarter, a level that is still fairly moderate by
historical standards.17
For industrial structures, the data on construction spending suggest that
expenditures fell in the third quarter, although the rate of decline appeared to be
smaller than the 18 percent annual rate observed in the second quarter. The
vacancy rate for industrial buildings increased from 8.2 percent in the second
quarter to 8.9 percent in the third quarter, which is the highest level since mid-
1994.
16. The WTC was leased for 99 years-longer than the life of the asset-and was
therefore treated by BEA as a sale in the NIPAs. The boost to nonresidential investment
spending was offset by a reduction in spending by state and local governments and had no effect
on GDP.
17. Great uncertainties remain in the market for office space in New York City. Recently, a
number of large tenants moved outside the Wall Street area in an effort to resume normal
operations as quickly as possible. Their longer-term locations probably are also in doubt,
especially given the reduced premium on centralized operations resulting from technological
developments in recent years. Some firms are reported to have been considering reductions in
relatively expensive downtown office space before September 11, and increased consciousness
of the risk of concentrated operations may reduce demand in that segment of the New York City
market and perhaps in some other cities as well. The longer-term balancing of these
crosscurrents affecting rents and property values remains highly uncertain.

Inventories
According to the advance NIPA data, real private inventories were run off in the
third quarter at a $12 billion annual rate, a similar rate of drawdown as in the
first half of the year. A complete set of monthly book-value data is only
available through August, and those data show that stocks continued to move
lower, although not so rapidly as in July. The average annual rate of decline for
the two months excluding motor vehicles, $52.6 billion, was a bit larger than the
second-quarter decrease. However, the continued overall reduction masks a
sharp increase in non-auto retail inventories in August, and overhangs persist in
several industries, notably computers and electronics manufacturing. The sharp
drop in September production points to a further inventory liquidation in that
month, although some backup at the retail level appears likely.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories decreased at an annual rate of
$37.3 billion in August, and the average decline for July and August, at
$40.2 billion, was a bit larger than the runoff in the second quarter. In
September, the book value of durable goods inventories, which make up about
two-thirds of the total manufacturing stock, fell a little more rapidly than in
August. Even so, with shipments off substantially in September, the inventory-
shipments ratio for durable goods manufacturers increased; all major categories
of durable goods now have ratios at the high end of the ranges seen in recent
years.
The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles was
essentially unchanged in August after having fallen at an annual rate of
$33 billion in July. The decline for the two months averaged $16 billion and
follows a small accumulation in the second quarter. Sales at non-auto
wholesalers rose 0.4 percent in August, and the inventory-sales ratio for the
sector edged down to 1.29, which is still toward the high end of readings during
the past two years.
The book value of retail inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual
rate of $19.8 billion in August after having fallen at a $12 billion rate in July.
Non-auto retail sales rose 0.5 percent in August, and the inventory-sales ratio
for this sector held steady at 1.47, the low end of the range that has prevailed
since early last year. Looking forward, the steep fall in retail sales in September
suggests some unintended backup in stock building that likely will prompt
further efforts at inventory reduction among retailers in the fourth quarter.

investment depreciation bonus, elimination of the corporate alternative
minimum tax, accelerated implementation of recently enacted tax cuts, and
additional tax rebate checks. In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman
Baucus has proposed $35 billion in tax cuts for fiscal 2002, split between
businesses and individuals, and $35 billion in additional spending on
unemployment insurance and health care. Separately, Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Byrd has proposed $20 billion in additional spending over
several years. How the Congress will resolve the substantial differences in
these bills remains unclear.
Final passage of the thirteen regular appropriations bills has been slow this year.
However, the House and Senate have agreed on spending levels and are in the
process of ironing out other policy differences. The congressional spending
target is $6 billion (or 1 percent) above the President's August budget request;
the extra money is dedicated to education grants and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
According to the September Monthly Treasury Statement, federal unified
budget receipts dropped nearly 30 percent below last year's level, with most of
the decline reflecting policy changes.18 The surplus for fiscal 2001 as a whole
was $127 billion, the second highest in history but well below the fiscal 2000
record of $237 billion. Receipts dropped 2 percent in fiscal 2001, the first
decline since 1983, reflecting, in part, the effects of the tax act. But even
excluding the tax law changes, we estimate that receipts would have risen only
1 percent, a rate still well below the growth of nominal GDP. Fiscal 2001
outlays rose 5 percent after accounting for timing shifts and the effects of
spectrum auction sales and subsidies.
State and local governments. Real purchases by state and local governments
were reported to have increased at an annual rate of just 0.4 percent in the third
quarter after rising at a 6.5 percent average pace during the first two quarters of
the year. However, excluding BEA's treatment of the July lease of the WTC,
real state and local purchases rose at an annual rate of 4.5 percent last quarter.
Within consumption, the pace of growth in both compensation and other
services was boosted a bit in the wake of the September 11 attacks: The
increases reflect overtime put in by police, firemen, and sanitation workers and
contracts for debris removal at the site of the WTC in New York.
18. Refunds were boosted by $11 billion from the final tranche of the rebate checks;
withheld income taxes were held down a bit because of the lower withholding rates; and
nonwithheld income tax payments were depressed by the extension of filing deadlines for those
affected by the terrorist attacks. In addition, corporate payments were reduced approximately
$25 billion because most corporations took advantage of the extension of the deadline to file
estimated payments (from September 17 to October 1 generally, and to January for those firms
affected by the terrorist attacks).

As a result of the slowdown in economic activity over the past year, and the
recent weakness in the tourism and related industries, around forty states have
reported that revenues in the third quarter-the first quarter of the fiscal year for
most states-came in below expectations. Many states will therefore be forced
to make midyear adjustments to avoid budget deficits this year. Currently, most
states seem to be focusing on spending cuts. For example, New York's
governor has a plan that includes a hiring freeze for nonessential services, an
early retirement incentive, and a freeze on department spending levels. In
addition, many states will take money out of reserve funds to balance their
budgets. So far, only a few states are considering tax hikes.
Prices and Labor Costs
Prices. With energy prices moderating, on balance, this past year, the twelve-
month change in the consumer price index has slowed to the same rate recorded
for the core consumer price index-2.6 percent over the twelve months ending
in September. Abstracting from the effects of insurance payments following the
events of September 11, we estimate that core PCE prices would have risen
1-1/2 percent over the twelve months to September. In contrast to the core CPI,
this series has decelerated somewhat over the past year.
After having fallen sharply during the previous three months, the CPI for energy
rebounded 2.6 percent in September. The price of motor fuel jumped last
month, as several refinery disruptions in August and early September drove
down inventories. These price increases appear to have been reversed recently,
and survey data suggest that retail prices of gasoline dropped considerably in
October, more than offsetting the September increase. The index for natural gas
fell another 5.5 percent in September, bringing the measure nearly back to its
year-earlier level; electricity rates declined as well. Overall energy prices in
September were up only 1.5 percent from a year earlier compared with a rise of
more than 15 percent during the preceding twelve-month period.
In September, the CPI excluding food and energy moved up 0.2 percent for the
third consecutive month; these modest increases left the three-month change for
this series at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, a rate similar to the increase over the
second quarter and well below the bump that occurred in the first few months of
this year. In September, the index for commodities other than food and energy
increased 0.3 percent after having declined in August; the rise reflected a
rebound in tobacco prices after a drop in August that reflected heavy
discounting. Prices of core goods excluding tobacco only ticked up in
September and have declined 1/2 percent over the past twelve months. Falling
prices of durable goods continued to reflect weak demand and a strong dollar:
In September, prices of audio and video equipment slid, and computer prices
tumbled for a second month, bringing the twelve-month decline in the index to

about 31 percent. The index for new motor vehicles was unchanged in
September and was down nearly 1 percent from a year earlier.19
The twelve-month change in the CPI for non-energy services-at 3.8 percent
-is higher than a year earlier, mainly because of a pickup in owners'
equivalent rent and tenants' rent. This upward trend in the services index
appears to have eased recently, as the change over the past three months has
fallen back from the rapid pace of the first half of 2001. Owners' equivalent
rent increased only 0.2 percent in September, and the index for lodging away
from home dropped 3.1 percent to a level more than 1 percent below its year-
earlier level. Airfares declined further in September and were also lower than a
year ago.
The core PCE price index apparently fell sharply in September reflecting BEA's
treatment of insurance payments resulting from the events of September 11.20
We expect this movement to be reversed in October. Even excluding this
special factor, though, core PCE prices for both goods and services look to have
decelerated over the past twelve months. The difference from the CPI reflects,
in part, the wider scope of PCE, which includes a number of categories with
non-market-based prices that have decelerated notably over the past year.
Prices for capital goods as measured by the PPI edged up in September, leaving
the twelve-month change at 0.6 percent, less than half the rate recorded a year
ago. The pace of computer price declines has picked up in recent months; over
the twelve months ending in September, the PPI for computers has dropped a
record 29 percent, nearly twice the rate of decline seen in the year-earlier
period. Prices of most other capital goods have softened as well.
Turning to broader price indexes, the chain price index for GDP was affected by
insurance adjustments to imported services and state and local government
expenditures as well as to PCE.21 Excluding the effects of all of these insurance
adjustments, GDP prices would have increased 1.2 percent at an annual rate in
the third quarter, considerably lower than the published increase of 2.1 percent.
(As with PCE prices, we expect these effects on overall GDP prices to be
reversed in the fourth quarter.) Over the past four quarters, we estimate that
19. The September index did not reflect the recent financing incentives because finance
charges are not included in the CPI.
20. Payments for insurance claims worth $20.5 billion at an annual rate were subtracted
from nominal consumption services, while real services were unaffected.
21. As with PCE, these insurance payments were subtracted from nominal services, while
real services were unaffected. Because payments owed by foreign insurers exceed payments to
be received by households or governments (with the remainder going to businesses and treated
as intermediate inputs), the plunge in import prices had a larger effect on GDP prices than did
the drop in consumer and government services inflation.

GDP prices excluding insurance adjustments increased around 2 percent, about
1/4 percentage point less than the increase over the preceding year. Gross
domestic purchases prices-also excluding insurance adjustments-decelerated
by somewhat more than GDP prices, reflecting the moderation in energy prices
over the past year.
At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate
materials has fallen sharply in recent months after having risen earlier this year.
Over the twelve months ending in September, this index declined nearly
1 percent, a marked turnaround from a 2.3 percent rise recorded during the
previous twelve months. Meanwhile, the PPI for core crude materials dropped
more than 10 percent over the past year. Indexes of industrial materials prices
(such as those of the Journal of Commerce and the Commodity Research
Bureau) have weakened further since the last Greenbook. Price declines have
been widespread across commodities and have included prices of farm
products, which have been reduced by bountiful harvests and weaker demand.
Inflation expectations from the University of Michigan survey fell considerably
in October. The median expectation for inflation over the coming year plunged
to 1 percent after having exceeded 2-1/2 percent for almost three years; this
sudden decline is the largest in nearly twenty years. The mean of these
expectations also fell sharply in October. Over a five- to ten-year horizon, the
median expectations moved down to 2.7 percent after having fluctuated around
3 percent over the past two years.
Labor costs. Recent data point to a slower rate of increase in compensation
costs. The ECI for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose
4 percent over the twelve months ended in September, down 0.6 percentage
point from the year-earlier period. The slowdown occurred in both the wages
and salaries and the benefits components. The deceleration in wages and
salaries was centered in the manufacturing and construction industries and
among sales workers in the service-producing industries, especially finance,
insurance, and real estate. Within the benefits component, the twelve-month
increases for paid leave, nonproduction bonuses, and retirement and savings
contributions were smaller than their increases over the preceding year.22 By
contrast, employer costs for workers' compensation have accelerated sharply
over the past year, and health-insurance costs rose at the same rapid pace of
nearly 9 percent both this year and last. Recent surveys of private-sector
companies suggest that employers' costs for health insurance may increase even
more rapidly in 2002. In particular, the Hewitt Associates' survey of health care
22. With the exception of health insurance, the benefits detail is unpublished and is
provided to us by the BLS on a confidential basis.

costs reports that the average increase expected for 2002 exceeds 15 percent
compared with a 10.2 percent rise this year.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private
payrolls rose 0.2 percent in September after a 0.5 percent rise in August. Over
the twelve months ending in September, average hourly earnings increased
4.3 percent. Although up from the year-earlier reading, this twelve-month
change has held fairly steady for most of this year. By contrast, the ECI for
wages and salaries of production or nonsupervisory workers-the ECI series
that most closely corresponds to the average hourly earnings data-increased
only 3.7 percent over the twelve months ending in September, down nearly
1/2 percentage point from the year-earlier pace.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector likely increased at an
annual rate of only about 4 percent in the third quarter, down from a
4-3/4 percent average pace in the first half of this year. So far this year, the
annual rate of change in nonfarm compensation per hour has exceeded the
increase in the ECI by about 1/2 percentage point, a difference considerably
more narrow than the 3 percentage point wedge recorded over the four quarters
of 2000.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
The tenor of incoming data over the intermeeting period has been interpreted by
market participants to be decidedly weak, prompting expectations of further
monetary easings. As a result, interest rates have moved down. Despite bleak
profits news and signs of deteriorating business credit quality, stock prices
rallied during most of October-returning briefly to their pre-September 11
levels-before giving up some of these gains late in the month. The functioning
of financial markets improved over the intermeeting period, with bid-asked
spreads narrowing and trading volume increasing in a number of markets.
Policy Expectations, Interest Rates, and Stock Prices
The FOMC's decision on October 2 to lower the target federal funds rate
50 basis points was largely anticipated and had relatively little effect on
financial markets. Since then, deterioration in the economic outlook has
heightened expectations of additional monetary easing over the balance of the
year. Judging from current futures prices and surveys, market participants are
certain of at least a 25 basis point reduction in the funds rate at the upcoming
meeting, and they place about even odds on a 50 basis point cut. In addition,
recent surveys suggest that investors anticipate that the Committee will continue
to view the balance of risks as tilted toward economic weakness, at least through
the January 2002 meeting. However, implied volatility from eurodollar
contracts, while down a bit over the intermeeting period, remains quite elevated
and indicates considerable uncertainty about the course of policy in the near
term.
Treasury yields have moved down between 30 and 40 basis points at the short
end of the maturity spectrum and 20 to 30 basis points at longer maturities.1
Market participants have pointed to the likelihood of greater fiscal stimulus as a
factor that has limited the decline in longer-term yields. Investment-grade
private yields declined roughly in line with those on comparably dated
Treasuries, but yields on speculative-grade debt dropped appreciably more.
Although spreads on riskier debt have fallen from peaks after September 11,
they remain about 3/4 percentage point above their pre-attack levels. In equity
markets, the Wilshire 5000 index has risen 2-3/4 percent, on net, over the
intermeeting period. On the perception that the tech sector may be bottoming
out, prices of technology firms jumped sharply and lifted the Nasdaq about
12-1/2 percent.
1. On October 31 (too late to be covered in Greenbook) the Treasury unexpectedly
announced that it is suspending issuance of both nominal and inflation-indexed thirty-year
bonds. Following the announcement, the yield on the thirty-year bond dropped sharply. Tables
and charts in Greenbook do not reflect these rate movements.

Business Finance
By late September, the corporate bond market had largely recovered from the
disruptions associated with the terrorist attacks, and nonfinancial corporations
sold nearly $18 billion of bonds in the last half of the month. The strong pace of
investment-grade bond issuance was maintained in October, as firms continued
taking advantage of low interest rates to retire existing long-term debt, to
finance merger and acquisition activity, and to boost their holdings of liquid
assets. Speculative-grade issuance, which all but ceased in September, returned
to its modest summer pace, but investors continued to shun riskier issues.
Commercial paper rebounded after running off substantially in September.
Some of the proceeds were apparently designated for merger and acquisition
financing, while some reportedly were used to repay bank loans taken down in
the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, likely contributing to the sharp contraction
in business loans at commercial banks in October. According to the respondents
to the Board's October senior loan officer survey, C&I loan demand slumped
over the past three months, largely because of reduced investment spending.
Moreover, a significant number of banks reported that they had tightened their
commercial lending standards and terms. Even with the weakness in business
loans, debt financing by nonfinancial firms, on net, in October is likely to
surpass the strong first-half pace.
After stalling in September, public equity issuance regained some ground in
October. The strong pickup in stock prices early in the month led to a number
of seasoned equity issues by domestic nonfinancial firms, though initial public
offerings remained at a near standstill. New filings have dropped, and with the
cancellation of a large number of planned offerings, the number of firms slated
to go public is now at a very low level relative to the norm of recent years.
Venture capital investments contracted again in the third quarter to a level about
one-quarter that of a year ago.
The SEC extended its temporary easing of restrictions on share repurchases
through October 12, and reports from market contacts suggest that buyback
activity was brisk throughout this period. Domestic cash-financed mergers
remained relatively strong in the third quarter, and new deals continued to be
announced. Although foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies have declined
noticeably, on net, retirements of domestic equity are likely to remain sizable.
Corporate earnings reports for the third quarter have come in close to, or slightly
ahead of, sharply reduced expectations among analysts. With about three-
fourths of the S&P 500 firms having reported results for the third quarter,
operating earnings per share are estimated to have fallen about 25 percent
relative to a year ago. Results were particularly weak for the transportation and
lodging sector, where earnings plunged 76 percent. In the technology and
telecom sectors, earnings were also down sharply relative to a year ago,

III-7
although the rate of decline appears to have slowed between the second and
third quarters. Looking ahead, analysts have significantly scaled back their
expectations for earnings growth next year, although they still anticipate a
substantial rebound in the first half of 2002. Taken at face value, analysts'
current forecasts imply a hefty 15 percent increase in earnings per share for the
S&P 500 next year.
Measures of corporate credit quality continue to indicate a high degree of
distress. Bond defaults remained at an elevated level in September, and model-
based forecasts indicate that the default rate on bonds will continue to rise
moderately over the next year. The number of ratings downgrades on corporate
bonds was high in September, when 80 percent of all airline debt was
downgraded. The pace of downgrades appears to have picked up significantly
in October. Most notably, S&P downgraded the debt of GM and Ford (totaling
$290 billion) from A to BBB+. In addition, a number of large businesses filed
for bankruptcy over the past few weeks, including Polaroid and Bethlehem
Steel.
Concerns about credit quality and ratings downgrades have led to a widening of
spreads in the market for commercial paper. The spread of thirty-day A2/P2
paper over A1/P1 paper, which was running at typical levels of about 25 basis
points before September 11, has jumped to 50 basis points. Because SEC
regulations restrict the quantity of lower-tier paper that can be held by money
funds, the downgrades of GM, Ford, and Disney to lower-tier status, along with
expectations of other downgrades, are putting some strain on the market.
Despite pronounced weakness in nonresidential construction, the expansion of
commercial mortgage debt appears to have been well maintained in the third
quarter, although growth is estimated to have decelerated to an annual rate of
about 9-1/4 percent. The market for commercial-mortgage-backed securities
(CMBS) remained strong in September, with large volumes of issuance spurred
by the low rates. The spread of investment-grade CMBS yields over swaps
narrowed slightly in October after climbing 20 to 30 basis points in the week of
September 11. The most recent reading on the CMBS delinquency rate for
September remained low, indicating little change in commercial real estate
credit quality. However, the market for office space continued to soften, as
office vacancy rates rose a good bit further in the third quarter, and a significant
number of loan officers reported that they had tightened lending standards on
commercial real estate loans over the past three months.
Household Finance
Mortgage rates have edged lower since the October FOMC meeting, with the
average rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages dropping to about 6.6 percent,
its low of the past twenty years. The cumulative decline in mortgage rates has
ignited a refinancing boom and has boosted the Mortgage Bankers Association

(MBA) refinancing index to the highest level since its inception in January
1980. Despite low mortgage rates, the MBA's home purchase index edged
down over the intermeeting period.
Growth of residential mortgage debt remained strong in the third quarter, albeit
not as fast as the extremely rapid pace in the second quarter. At the same time,
the growth of consumer debt slowed sharply. The resulting deceleration in
household debt, combined with lower mortgage rates, contributed to a drop in
the debt service burden in the third quarter. The bulk of the decline, however,
can be attributed to a temporary rise in personal income stemming from tax
refunds.
While household credit quality has deteriorated some this year, delinquency
rates still are below the levels of the early and middle 1990s. The delinquency
rate on auto loans is estimated to have inched up in September, while that on
credit card pools has hovered in a narrow, though elevated, range over the past
several months. Personal bankruptcy rates moved up a bit in October.
Household assets relative to disposable income fell sharply in the third quarter,
reflecting both the general downward trend in equity prices and a deceleration in
home prices. Net flows into equity mutual funds, which contracted slightly in
August as households responded to the falling and volatile stock market,
plunged in September. The outflow in September was the largest ever recorded,
though it was substantially smaller as a proportion of mutual fund assets than
the outflow experience after the 1987 stock market crash. As the stock market
stabilized in the first weeks of October, net flows turned positive.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The federal government paid down marketable debt, on balance, over the
intermeeting period. Buyback operations, which were cancelled in September in
the wake of terrorist attacks, resumed in October and proceeded without a hitch,
although smaller projected surpluses heightened speculation that the size of
future buybacks could be pared.2
The Treasury securities market experienced an extraordinary volume of "fails-
to-deliver" in the weeks following the terrorist attacks on September 11. Fails
soared from less than $50 billion per week to $1.4 trillion by the week of
September 19, and they were most pronounced among the on-the-run five- and
ten-year notes. The difficulty in obtaining these securities was reflected in repo
rates, which were quite low for much of the intermeeting period. According to
2. In its October 31 announcement, the Treasury indicated that no debt buyback operations
would take place in January 2002 and that the amount and timing of future buybacks would be
determined on a quarterly basis.

market participants, problems in the settlement of trades in Treasury securities
following the attacks and the associated uncertainties may have created
gridlock, as dealers feared that some counterparties would fail to deliver
securities to them and chose, in turn, to fail in their delivery obligations.
To help ease the resulting supply pressures, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York eased restrictions on its Treasury securities lending program. Also, the
Treasury reopened its ten-year note, selling an additional $6 billion worth of
these securities on October 4. By the middle of the month, the situation in the
repo market had stabilized, and on October 18, the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York reimposed its normal rules for securities lending. Despite the
lingering problems with fails, market participants report that liquidity in the
secondary market for Treasury securities-as measured by bid-asked spreads
and trading volumes-had returned to nearly normal levels by early October.
In the market for agency securities, the government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) maintained their regular issuance of benchmark securities over the
intermeeting period. However, there has been some speculation of late about
the GSEs' commitment to issuing longer-term bonds. Recently, Fannie Mae
announced an auction schedule for next year that included a smaller number of
offerings. Anticipating this announcement, liquidity in the secondary market for
these securities has reportedly deteriorated considerably in recent months.
State and Local Government Finance
Yields on long-term municipal bonds edged down in October to near their
lowest levels since 1998. A rise in the issuance of long-term tax-exempt
securities in October was spurred in part by low interest rates and the
rescheduling of some September issues that were delayed by the terrorist
attacks. New capital issuance topped its strong first-half pace.
The ratio of municipal to corporate AAA yields edged up in October, but it
remains low, suggesting that deterioration in credit quality of the municipal
sector is not a major concern. Indeed, upgrades continued to outpace
downgrades, although there has been a slight pickup in the number of state and
local entities that have been put on watch by the rating agencies for possible
downgrades.
Money and Bank Credit
Growth of the broad monetary aggregates slowed considerably in October after
their rapid expansion in September, when growth was boosted by the
transactions disruptions and safe-haven demand for liquid assets. Even so,
averaging through the recent distortions to money flows, M2 rose at a strong
12 percent annual rate over September and October, a step-up from the rapid
pace posted early in the year; growth continues to be spurred by sharp declines

in M2 opportunity cost owing to monetary policy easings this year as well as a
volatile stock market.
Bank credit is estimated to have contracted at about a 10-1/4 percent annual rate
in October, as the disruptions to business financing patterns and payments
systems that bloated bank balance sheets after the terrorist attacks have largely
dissipated. Business loans declined at a 16-1/2 percent annual rate in October.
Among other loan categories, real estate lending at commercial banks continued
to expand moderately, with home equity loans especially strong. Consumer
lending also strengthened somewhat in October, after adjusting for loans that
left banks' books in the form of securitizations.

Appendix
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
The October 2001 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. The survey included supplementary questions
on banks' internal credit risk ratings for business loan customers, on business loans for
the purpose of share buybacks, and on liquidity in the secondary market for business
loans. Loan officers from fifty-three large domestic banks and twenty U.S. branches
and agencies of foreign banks participated in the survey.
The number of foreign and domestic banking institutions that reported tightening
standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the past three
months increased notably after having edged down in the previous two surveys. The
fraction of domestic institutions that tightened standards for commercial real estate
loans in the October survey remained in the elevated range of the past year. Almost
twice as many domestic respondents as in the August survey indicated that a less
favorable or more uncertain economic outlook was a very important reason for
tightening standards and terms on C&I loans, a rise in pessimism consistent with the
weak tenor of recent economic data. Compared with the proportions in the August
survey, considerably larger net fractions of domestic banks experienced weaker demand
for both C&I and commercial real estate loans over the past three months.
In answer to the special questions in the current survey, most domestic banks and a
substantial number of foreign institutions said they had downgraded between 1 percent
and 10 percent of the dollar volume of C&I loans on their books over the past three
months-in particular, loans to firms in the airline and hospitality industries. Much
smaller shares of loans were upgraded. Both domestic and foreign respondents also
noted that liquidity in the secondary loan market had deteriorated somewhat in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks.
The net fractions of domestic banks that tightened standards and increased spreads over
their cost of funds for all types of consumer loans over the past three months moved up
from the levels in the August survey, but they remained within the range of the past
several quarters. According to the domestic respondents in the October survey, demand
for consumer loans weakened over the report period, after little net change was reported
in the previous two surveys. Standards for residential mortgage loans were largely
unchanged over the past three months, and demand for mortgages to purchase homes
was reported to be little changed.
Lending to Businesses
The October survey showed a rise in the fraction of domestic banks reporting that they
had tightened standards on C&I loans over the past three months, a fraction that had
slipped in the previous two surveys. The percentage of domestic banks that reported
tightening their standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms rose to
49 percent in October from 40 percent in August. Results were similar for lending
standards on loans to small firms--40 percent of domestic banks reported tighter
standards over the past three months, up from 32 percent in August. The net fraction of

III-A-2
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported tightening standards for C&I
customers rose to 65 percent in October from 50 percent in August.
As in the August survey, more than half of domestic banks reported increasing spreads
of loan rates over their cost of funds and charging higher premiums on riskier loans to
large and middle-market firms. Larger fractions than in August imposed more stringent
loan covenants and collateral requirements on these firms. In general, smaller net
fractions of domestic respondents tightened terms on loans to small firms. However,
the number of banks that tightened non-price-related loan terms for small firms rose
considerably when compared with the August survey. Despite the overall tightening of
standards and terms over the past three months, a few banks indicated a willingness to
address the needs of business customers in areas affected by the atrocities of
September 11.
The tightening of terms at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks was somewhat
more pronounced than at their domestic counterparts. Compared with the previous
survey, when 50 percent of foreign respondents increased spreads of loan rates over
their cost of funds, 65 percent reported doing so in October. Similarly, the fraction of
foreign institutions that raised premiums on riskier loans rose from 60 percent in
August to 65 percent in the current survey. The fraction of foreign banks that increased
the cost of credit lines and tightened collateral requirements over the past three months
also rose relative to the previous survey.
All survey respondents pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook
as at least a somewhat important reason for changing their commercial lending policies;
that reason was said to be "very important" for 64 percent of domestic banks, up
significantly from 37 percent in the August survey. Most of the domestic and foreign
respondents that had tightened standards or terms on C&I loans over the previous three
months also continued to cite a worsening of industry-specific problems and a reduced
tolerance for risk as important reasons for changing their lending policies. Concern
about credit quality was cited as a reason for tightening credit by 46 percent of domestic
banks and 72 percent of foreign branches and agencies.
Almost three-fourths of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for C&I loans
from large and middle-market firms over the past three months, up considerably from
about one-half in the August survey. Loan demand from small firms also weakened,
with more than 50 percent of domestic respondents, on net, noting weakness in October,
compared with 42 percent in August. On net, 30 percent of foreign branches and
agencies saw weaker demand over the past three months, compared with 25 percent in
the previous survey. Many banks commented that the terrorist attacks exacerbated an
ongoing slowdown in demand for business loans.
All but one domestic bank that reported weaker business loan demand cited a decline in
customers' need for credit to finance capital expenditures as at least a somewhat
important reason, and almost 40 percent chose the same reason as "very important."
Most domestic respondents also noted a decline in demand to finance mergers and
acquisitions, inventory accumulation, and accounts receivable. One-half of the foreign
institutions that reported weaker loan demand pointed to the decline in demand for

III-A-3
merger-related financing as a very important reason, and 38 percent also cited lower
investment spending as being very important.
In light of the pace of net downgrades of corporate debt by the major credit rating
agencies, the October survey included a series of questions about changes in banks'
internal credit risk ratings. Essentially all domestic and foreign institutions indicated
that more than three-fourths of the dollar volume of their C&I loans is internally rated.
Almost half of the domestic banks surveyed had downgraded less than 5 percent of their
C&I loan portfolio over the past three months. An additional 31 percent of them had
downgraded between 6 percent and 10 percent, and 21 percent had downgraded
between 11 percent and 30 percent of their business loans over the same period.
Foreign branches and agencies had downgraded somewhat larger fractions of the C&I
loans on their books. In particular, almost 16 percent of these institutions had
downgraded more than 30 percent of their business loan portfolios. The reported
downgrades in internal risk ratings at both domestic and foreign respondents were offset
somewhat by upgrades: About 60 percent of domestic and foreign banks indicated that
they had upgraded at least some loans in their C&I loan portfolios.
Almost 30 percent of domestic respondents and 40 percent of foreign respondents noted
that they had downgraded considerably their loans to commercial airlines and other
nondefense aerospace firms, with significant additional fractions reporting more
moderate downgrades in these sectors. The portion of the banks' portfolios covering
loans to travel and other leisure-related service businesses was also hard hit by
downgrades, a move likely reflecting the disruptions caused by the terrorist attacks.
Downgrades were pervasive among loans to high-technology firms and to automobile
manufacturers and distributors, as well as to firms in consumer cyclical industries. Of
the sectors named in the survey, only energy and defense avoided widespread
downgrades over the past three months.
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, as market liquidity became a concern, the SEC
temporarily eased restrictions on share repurchases, and reports from market
participants suggest that buyback activity was elevated in the ensuing weeks. Very few
domestic banks, however, reported an increase in demand for loans to finance share
buybacks. By contrast, a modest fraction of foreign institutions did experience some
increase in demand for this type of loan. About 30 percent of both foreign and
domestic banks tightened standards for below-investment-grade firms on loans to
finance equity repurchases.
A separate question asked banks about changes since September 11 in the liquidity of
the secondary market for C&I loans. About one-fifth of domestic and foreign
institutions reported that loan-trading volume had decreased considerably and more
than 50 percent noted that it had decreased somewhat. The reports of diminished
liquidity were corroborated by the widening of bid-asked spreads, with 21 percent of all
institutions reporting that the spreads had widened considerably and 50 percent of them
indicating that the spreads had widened somewhat. Separate comments by the loan
officers indicated that the reduction in liquidity was particularly severe for loans rated
as below investment grade.

III-A-4
More than 40 percent of domestic banks tightened standards on commercial real estate
loans over the past three months, up a tad from the August survey. About one-fourth of
the foreign institutions that engage in commercial real estate lending also tightened
standards in the current survey. The demand for commercial real estate loans weakened
over the survey period, with more than 50 percent of domestic and 27 percent of foreign
respondents, on net, reporting lower demand for this type of loan.
Lending to Households
Banks' credit standards for approving residential mortgage loans were largely
unchanged over the past three months, with only two banks reporting that they had
tightened lending standards somewhat. According to the domestic respondents, demand
for residential mortgages remained unchanged, on net, over the same period.
On net, 8 percent of domestic banks indicated that they are less willing to make
consumer installment loans now as opposed to three months ago. Specifically, more
than one-fifth of banks reported that they had tightened standards on both credit card
and other types of consumer loans over the past three months, somewhat higher
fractions than reported doing so in the August survey. In addition, 14 percent of
domestic banks increased the minimum required credit score for credit card
applications, and 21 percent of them raised spreads of interest rates charged on
outstanding balances relative to their cost of funds. For other types of consumer loans,
14 percent of respondents raised the minimum required credit score, and 24 percent of
them increased spreads over their cost of funds. Almost one-fourth of domestic banks,
on net, reported moderately weaker demand for consumer loans over the past three
months.

Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services was $27.1 billion in August,
$2 billion smaller than in July. For July-August combined, the deficit was
$338 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, considerably smaller than in the
second quarter as imports fell more than exports declined.

The value of imports fell 1.1 percent in August, the fifth sharp decline in
seven months. Decreases were recorded in almost all major trade categories.
The value of imported oil changed little as a small drop in quantity was offset by
an increase in price. For July and August combined, the value of imports fell
14 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter level; this follows a similar
decrease in the second quarter. The decline in July-August was spread among
all major trade categories other than automotive products, food, and to a much
lesser extent aircraft, which rose.
The value of exports increased 1 percent in August, only partly reversing the
sharp drop recorded in July. Much of the increase was in automotive products,
industrial supplies, and agricultural products. For July and August combined,
the value of exports fell 12 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter
level; this follows a similar decrease in the second quarter. While the decline
was concentrated in exported capital goods, there were also substantial decreases
in exported consumer goods and industrial supplies.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil The BLS price of imported oil rose a bit more in September than in August
but not enough to offset a sharp drop in July. For the third quarter as a whole,
the price of imported oil fell 10 percent at an annual rate, about the same rate of
decline as in the second quarter and much less than in the first quarter. A few
days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, oil prices fell sharply as
apprehensions about possible supply disruptions gave way to concerns about
weaker world oil demand and the increasing difficulty OPEC will face in
defending its price target. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate has
recently been trading near $22 per barrel, down more than $5 per barrel from
early September.
Non-oil imports. The price of imported non-oil goods was unchanged in
September and the price of imported core goods rose 0.1 percent, both after
declining for seven consecutive months. For core goods, price changes turned
positive for all major trade categories other than industrial supplies, which
declined (but at a much slower rate than in the previous four months). For the
third quarter, the price of core goods fell just over 6 percent at an annual rate,
about the same rate of decline as in the second quarter. As in the second quarter,
the drop in price was led by decreases in the price of imported industrial
supplies, with smaller price declines recorded in all other major trade categories.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports (total and core) rose 0.1 percent in
September following seven consecutive months of decline. The increase was
led by a petroleum-driven rise in the price index for exported nonagricultural
industrial supplies. In the third quarter the price of exported core goods declined
about 1.5 percent at an annual rate, a slightly faster rate than recorded in the
second quarter. A larger drop in the price of exported industrial supplies than in
the second quarter was only partly offset by a swing from negative to positive in
the price of agricultural exports.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreigners continued to acquire U.S. securities at a robust rate in August
(line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table). Net purchases
of Treasuries, agency bonds, and corporate bonds all were concentrated in
international financial centers in the United Kingdom, Asia, and the Caribbean
(lines 4a, b, and c). Canadians sold net both agency and corporate bonds. Net
purchases of Treasuries were positive for the first month since May. Net
purchases of agency bonds continued at the strong rate of the first and second
quarters, while purchases of corporates slowed somewhat in conjunction with
the decreased rate of gross bond issuance by U.S. firms. Of the $14.6 billion net
purchases of U.S. stock in line 4d, $6.6 billion was in the form of a stock swap
resulting from the Citibank acquisition of the Mexican bank, Grupo Financiero

IV-6
Banamex Accival SA. There was no evidence, at least by the end of August, of
any compensating net sales of U.S. stock by Mexican residents.
U.S. residents reduced their net holdings of foreign securities (line 5), as
moderate acquisitions of foreign stock were more than offset by strong net sales
of foreign bonds (lines 5b, 5c and 5a). Geographically, the net bond sales were
widespread: more than $1 billion each in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan,
and Mexico.
Official foreigners reduced their net holdings in the United States by a moderate
$8 billion in August. Argentina, Japan, and Venezuela registered significant
reductions. Partial data show a $13 billion increase in official reserves held at
FRBNY from the end of August through the second week of October; the
increase in Japanese reserves at FRBNY during this period, primarily the result
of intervention operations in September, more than accounted for the total.
Net inflows in the banking sector were up substantially in August over July (line
3); these were largely attributable to the activity of U.S. agencies and branches
with their own foreign offices.

Foreign Exchange Markets
Data released during the intermeeting period suggesting dimmer prospects for
foreign economic activity, particularly for the euro area but also for Japan, were
not seen as eliciting policy reactions sufficient to counter the perceived
downward momentum in those economies. In response, foreign long-term
interest rates moved down more than the comparable U.S. rate, which may have
been supported in part by U.S. fiscal policy actions, and foreign currency values
declined against the dollar.
On net over the period following the October FOMC meeting, the trade-
weighted, foreign exchange value of the dollar against the other major currencies
rose more than 1 percent. The dollar appreciated about 1-1/2 percent against the
yen, sterling, and the euro, and 1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar. Over the
same period, a trade weighted average of long-term government bond yields
abroad declined more than 30 basis points, leaving the interest rate differential in
favor of dollar-denominated assets about 20 basis points higher.

Against a weighted average of currencies of other important trading partners, the
dollar declined slightly, almost fully accounted for by a fall of 2% percent
against the Mexican peso. The peso's rise nearly fully reversed the decline that
occurred against the dollar in early September. The strength of the peso was not
matched by currencies of other emerging market economies, and the Brazilian
real and Chilean peso, in particular, appeared to suffer under concerns about

IV-9
prospects in neighboring Argentina, where equity prices declined significantly in
the past week and bond yields moved to record highs.
Foreign short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries generally
declined during the intermeeting period. The largest moves down were in
Canada and the United Kingdom, where monetary authorities reduced policy
interest rates 75 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively. In the euro area,
short-term market interest rates declined 13 basis points. The ECB left its policy
rates unchanged during the intermeeting period, but market rates drifted down as
expectations for an easing of its stance by December or earlier remained in
place. The Bank of Japan continued to leave an elevated amount of reserves in
the banking system, keeping its current account positions above ¥6 trillion and
short-term interest rates near zero.

Despite a more pessimistic outlook for activity, foreign industrial country stock
markets generally rose on net during the period, reflecting perhaps an unwinding
of the sharp increase in risk aversion immediately following the terrorist attacks
in September as well as some realized or prospective monetary policy easing.
Equity prices in many emerging market countries also rose during the period, as
spillovers from building concerns about Argentina failed to check entirely an
apparent return of willingness to accept risk. Stock prices in Mexico, Brazil, and

IV-10
Chile registered net gains, even as Argentine equities slid more than 5 percent.
Asian share performance was more mixed, with a double-digit increase in Korea
and solid gains in Taiwan and Singapore balanced by very weak performance in
the Philippines and declines in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Spillovers from the difficulties faced by Argentina were a bit more apparent in
sovereign debt markets. While yield spreads for Mexico and Brazil moved lower
on balance during the period, larger declines established earlier in the period had
shrunk rapidly by the end as these yields moved up in sync with Argentina's.
Sovereign debt yield spreads in Argentina rose nearly 400 basis points on net to
about 2050 basis points, with much of that net rise occurring in the past ten days.
By the end of the period, market participants were still waiting for an
announcement from the government of Argentina on their plans for debt

IV-11
restructuring, and Argentina's debt had been downgraded to only two grades
above default. Spillovers from Argentina seemed to show also in South
American currency markets, as the Brazilian real declined about 1/4 percent
against the dollar, despite continued sales of dollar-indexed debt by Brazilian
authorities, and the Chilean peso depreciated 2 1/4 percent.
.The Desk did not intervene during the
period for the accounts of the System or Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the foreign industrial economies showed signs of having
begun to stabilize in August, but renewed weakness emerged in September. In
Japan, recent data point to another sharp decline in output in the third quarter.
Data for industrial production in the euro area and the United Kingdom suggest
that activity was bottoming out in August, but business confidence collapsed
following the terrorist attacks. Growth remained weak in Canada as exports
continued to slide.
With oil prices trending down and economic activity weakening, inflation
continued to decline. The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation drifted
lower in the euro area and Canada in September, while retail price inflation in
the United Kingdom fell back below the Bank of England's 2-1/2 percent target.
Deflation continued in Japan.
Citing concerns about deteriorating business and consumer confidence, a
number of central banks further eased monetary policy in October. On October
4, the Bank of England cut interest rates 25 basis points, while later that month
the Bank of Canada announced a 75-basis-point cut. Banks' reserves held at the
Bank of Japan have declined some since late September, but remain at elevated
levels. The ECB kept its monetary policy stance unchanged.
Recent economic indicators for Japan remain consistent with a sharp
contraction in the third quarter. Industrial production plunged 2.9 percent in
September and the broader all-industry index moved lower in August.
Shipments of machinery also dropped in September. Machinery orders were
down steeply in July and August on average from their second-quarter levels,
despite an increase in August that followed several months of sharp declines.
Private consumption, which had been holding up reasonably well so far this
year, also appears to have weakened, with workers' household expenditures
down about 1/2 percent in the third quarter. New passenger car registrations
rebounded strongly in August, but early indicators suggest that they plunged
again in September. Residential and nonresidential building starts were about
flat in August, but fell noticeably in September.
Labor market conditions continued to deteriorate. The unemployment rate rose
to a record 5.3 percent in September, with employment down 2 percent from its
recent peak in November of last year. The job-offers-to-applicants ratio fell to
0.57, its lowest level since May last year.

Prices continued to decline. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area
(which exclude fresh food but include energy) were down 1 percent in October
from a year earlier. Deflation in wholesale prices for domestic goods has
intensified as the impact of the earlier run-up in energy prices has faded.
The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) widened a little in the
third quarter, as a 6 percent drop in imports, largely reflecting weakening
domestic demand, outpaced a 4 percent decline in exports.
The Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan index of business conditions
plunged in September, with the diffusion index for all enterprises falling to -36
from -27 in June. The BOJ said it received 70 percent of the survey responses
after the September 11 terrorist attacks, although it is not known what portion
had actually been filled out before that date. The deterioration was broad-based,

IV-14
with the largest declines recorded in the manufacturing sector. Indicators of
excessive inventory levels rose, and the number of firms that expect prices to fall
increased for both input and output prices. Expectations for sales growth and
profits were revised down, while capital investment was still expected to fall
about 6 percent this fiscal year.
The BOJ continued to maintain the level of the outstanding balance of banks'
deposits held at the central bank "at above ¥6 trillion." The balance rose to
¥12-1/2 trillion in late September, but has since fallen back to between ¥8-10
trillion. In late October, the government announced plans for a supplemental
budget of 2.7 trillion (about 1/2 percent of GDP) for the current fiscal year, of
which about ¥1 trillion is expected to be "real-water" spending. Unlike previous
spending packages, the focus will be on labor market programs rather than on
public works. Press reports suggest that a second supplemental budget may be
enacted early next year.
Recent data for the euro area suggest that although activity may have been
stabilizing in August, the events of September 11 took a toll on business
confidence, raising the risk of renewed economic deterioration in the current
quarter. Euro-area industrial production rose 1.1 percent in August, after a sharp
drop in July, and was just 0.3 percent below the second-quarter level for the two
months on average. German manufacturing orders also rebounded in August,
led by a notable improvement in domestic orders. In the only available activity
data for September (including data from before and after the 11th), French
household consumption of manufactured products edged up 0.2 percent
following robust gains in the previous two months, as consumption was buoyed
by new tax credits to low-income households.
Business sentiment took a sharp downturn in September, but incoming surveys
are mixed regarding further deterioration in October. The September euro-area
purchasing managers' survey for the manufacturing sector declined to the lowest
level in its four-year history. The service sector purchasing managers' survey
also declined sharply to just below the level that would indicate contraction of
activity. The German Ifo index of business confidence registered its sharpest
drop in September since the oil crisis in 1973, declining to a level normally
associated with a mild recession. The ISAE Italian business confidence index
suffered its worst ever monthly decline in September, falling to its lowest level
since 1996. The German ZEW indicator, which is derived from a financial
market survey, declined in October to a percent balance of +9.8, much lower
than the average of survey responses (+20.8) taken prior to September 11, but a
bit higher than the average of responses (+8.0) taken between September 12 and
15. The French INSEE business sentiment index was unchanged in October, as

IV-15
a deterioration in the outlook for manufacturing output-to its lowest level since
July 1993-was offset by a less-negative assessment of orders.

Labor market data for the euro area as a whole have yet to show much
deterioration, as the harmonized unemployment rate edged down to 8.3 percent
in July and remained at that rate in August. National statistics for September,
however, show the French unemployment rate rising for the fourth consecutive
month and an increase in the German unemployment rate.
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation fell to 2.5 percent
in September, still above the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling, and CPI data for
Germany and Italy suggest a further moderate decline in October. Core
consumer price inflation (which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco)

IV-16
edged up to 2.2 percent in September on a twelve-month basis, but the
twelve-month rate of change in producer prices, which peaked at 6.6 percent last
October, has moved down steadily this year.
In the United Kingdom, the preliminary estimate of real GDP showed a pickup
in growth to 2.4 percent in the third quarter. The level of manufacturing output
fell, while service sector growth slowed slightly. The preliminary estimate of
real GDP is based on the first two months of the quarter, and therefore does not
include any possible effects from the September attacks.
Indicators for the fourth quarter paint a mixed picture. Preliminary data suggest
that consumer confidence fell slightly in October. Households' expectations of
their own financial situation declined as well, but generally remained optimistic.
However, business confidence plummeted in October to its lowest level in three
years. September surveys of expectations in the service sector are consistent
with growth slowing in the fourth quarter.
Labor market conditions continued to be tight. The official claims-based
unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in September, the lowest rate in 26
years. The labor force survey measure of the unemployment rate increased from
a record low of 5 percent for the three months centered in June to 5.1 percent for
the three months centered in July.
Largely reflecting declines in gasoline and oil prices, the twelve-month rate of
retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) fell to 2.3 percent in
September, below the Bank of England's official target of 2.5 percent. In
addition, producer input prices were down 6 percent in September from the same
month a year earlier. Average annual earnings growth in August fell below the
4-1/2 percent rate that the Bank of England believes to be compatible with its
inflation target.
On October 4, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England
cut the official repo rate 25 basis points to 4.5 percent, the sixth 25-basis-point
cut this year. In its statement, the MPC cited weaker-than-expected global
growth and concerns about business and consumer confidence as reasons for its
easing.

In Canada, indicators for the third quarter have tended to be weak. Real GDP
was about flat in July and August on average. The trade surplus narrowed in
August as exports weakened in all sectors except motor vehicles. Retail sales,
however, rose in August, reversing a July decline. Manufacturing shipments
increased in August, with gains concentrated in the oil and coal sectors, but new
orders declined because of weakness in the aerospace sector. Canada's
unemployment rate in September was flat at 7.2 percent, despite a small gain in
employment. Consumer confidence fell in the third quarter, with the surveys
collected after September 11 little changed from those obtained previously.
Business confidence dropped dramatically in the quarter, however, to a level not
seen since the 1990-91 recession.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation declined slightly to 2.6
percent in September, comfortably within the Bank of Canada's target range of 1
to 3 percent. On October 23, the Bank lowered its policy rate 75 basis points to
3 percent, bringing the cumulative reduction for this year to 300 basis points.
The accompanying announcement stressed the importance of underpinning

IV-18
confidence and supporting domestic demand growth in an environment of
exceptional uncertainty.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic activity in our major developing country trading partners has
generally continued to weaken, as adverse spillovers from the slowdown in the
United States and other industrial countries have weighed on these economies.
In addition, the poor performance of the global high-tech industry has continued
to depress activity in emerging Asia, and Argentina's ongoing financial
difficulties have caused problems for several of its Latin American neighbors,
particularly for Brazil.
Sluggish domestic demand has generally allowed inflationary pressures in these
countries to dissipate, although consumer price inflation in Mexico and
Indonesia ticked up slightly in September. Developing country exports have
remained very depressed, but anemic activity has also restrained imports, and
external balances have actually improved in some countries.
Little good news has come out of Argentina since the last Greenbook.
Industrial production fell almost 1 percent in September, and data for previous
months were revised lower. Declines were reported in almost all sectors but
were particularly striking in the automotive industry, where sales and output
were down over 45 percent in September from their year-earlier levels.
Deflation continued with consumer prices falling 1.1 percent over the twelve
months ending in September. Tax revenues for September plunged 14 percent
from a year earlier. Consumer confidence dropped in early October to its lowest
level since mid-1998 when the series began.
Argentina held major elections for all of the seats of the Senate and half of those
in the lower house in mid-October. The results showed a solid gain for the
opposition Peronist party, which now has a majority in the Senate and the largest
minority in the lower house. The result was expected. Nonetheless, it further
complicates the process of achieving the government's goals of recording a zero
fiscal deficit and implementing structural changes. Another problem facing the
government is resolving the debate about possible restructuring of its debt.
Although the government has indicated that it is now considering measures to
reduce the near-term financing burden imposed by its debt (including debt to
international creditors), no specifics have yet been announced. As a
consequence of the uncertainty, the spread on Argentine foreign-currency
denominated sovereign debt (as measured by the EMBI+ index), which fell more
than 150 basis points to just below 1700 basis points after the elections, has
recently soared above 2100 basis points. Outflows of reserves and deposits have
also picked up again.

In Mexico, recent data releases further document that the economy continued to
shrink in the third quarter. The index of overall economic activity-a proxy for
monthly real GDP-declined in August, and industrial production was flat in that
month. In line with the weakness of external and domestic demand, exports and
imports fell in the third quarter, and the trade deficit widened a little. Although
inflation crept up a little in September, the twelve-month inflation rate remained
below the government's year-end target of 62 percent.
Two recent indicators for September suggest that the Mexican economy
continues to be hit hard by the slowdown in the United States, including effects
resulting from the terrorist attacks. First, the Bank of Mexico's business
confidence index plunged in September to a level not seen since the Russian
crisis in August 1998. Second, according to Mexico's tourism minister, the
number of tourist visits to Mexico declined 35 percent in September. However,
the adverse effects on Mexican financial markets in the aftermath of the terrorist
attacks appear to have been reversed to a large extent; recently, on balance,
equity markets have risen and the Mexican peso has appreciated significantly,
more than reversing the depreciation of the currency following the terrorist
attacks.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have pointed to weak activity,
particularly in consumption. Industrial production edged up a little in August,
after several months of declines, supported by a 6 percent increase in capital
goods production. However, output of consumer durable goods declined
7 percent in August. There was also a 5 percent seasonally-adjusted fall in auto
production in September but, despite this, inventories rose that month. The
consumer confidence indicator declined 9 percent in October. Weak domestic
demand, and consequent weakness in imports, largely accounts for the
improvement in the trade balance in the third quarter. Consumer prices rose
6.4 percent in September from their year-earlier levels, slightly above the
6 percent upper bound of the central bank's inflation target range.
The Brazilian real and other Brazilian asset prices continued to come under
downward pressures, in part reflecting spillovers from the market jitters in
Argentina, prompting the Brazilian government in late September to draw on the
$4.7 billion in IMF funds that had been made available to it on September 14
upon approval of Brazil's new $15 billion support package. The government
also issued sizeable amounts of dollar-indexed debt, raising the stock of the debt
from $72 billion at end-August to $80 billion at end-September. The central

IV-25
bank kept its policy overnight interest rate steady at 19 percent, citing concerns
about the effect of the depreciation of the currency on inflation.

There has been little new information on the Venezuelan economy since the last
Greenbook. Reports have pointed to strength in the construction and
telecommunications industries, in part reflecting increased government
expenditure. However, the decline in oil prices is beginning to temper the
recovery and has worsened fiscal imbalances. After coming under pressure in
September, international reserves have picked up slightly this month but remain
below their end-2000 levels.

In Korea, industrial production registered significant increases in August and
September following four consecutive monthly declines. The strong figure for
industrial production in September appears to have overstated the underlying
strength of production, as the Korean Thanksgiving holiday fell in early October
this year, rather than in late September as it usually does, meaning that
September had three more working days than usual. Even taking account of this
apparent distortion, however, these production figures seem to suggest a
surprising resiliency in activity in Korea. Despite the strong production figures,
the index of business sentiment dropped sharply in September, falling to its
lowest level in nine months.
Korean officials have indicated that the government hopes to announce soon a
plan to reprivatize the banking system, selling off stakes in banks acquired after
the 1997-1998 financial crisis, even if such sales result in substantial losses
relative to the amount of funds that the government has put into the banks or if
privatized banks wind up in foreign hands. The government currently has full
equity control of seven major Korean banks and minority stakes in a number of
others. So far, only one bank, Korean First Bank, has been sold by the
government to private interests.

Data for the ASEAN region continue to point to significant weakness. The
decline in global demand for electronics has battered the economy of Singapore,
where real GDP plummeted at a 10 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
Industrial production in Malaysia, which exports significant quantities of
electronic goods, has also posted recent declines, and output has also decreased
in Indonesia in recent months, as demand for its consumer goods exports has
fallen. In response to the weakness in activity, both Singapore and Malaysia
have announced fiscal stimulus packages and loosened monetary policy. The
Philippines also has lowered interest rates but is constrained in expanding fiscal
policy due to an already high debt burden.
Despite the slump in external demand, the countries in the region, with the
exception of the Philippines, continued to register trade surpluses. This reflects
the fact that, although exports have fallen rapidly (especially exports of
electronic goods), imports have also declined sharply, both because of the high
import content of the region's exports and slowdowns in domestic demand.
Indonesia continues to struggle with relatively high inflation, but inflation fell
during the third quarter in the rest of the region, reflecting the weakness in
domestic demand.

In China, following two months of slower growth, industrial production
rebounded in September. Retail sales also showed strength in September, rising
9.9 percent from a year earlier and up slightly from August. In response to the
successful conclusion of China's negotiations with the WTO, indicators of
current and future foreign direct investment (FDI) were up sharply in September,
after pointing to a slowdown in August. This suggests that although the global
investment climate has weakened, China is continuing to attract large quantities
of foreign investment. The gains in FDI and consumer spending were somewhat
offset by reduced investment by state-owned enterprises in September relative to
August.
One potential sign of weakness in China has been a return to deflation;
consumer prices declined slightly for the twelve months ending in September.
Prices of food and services have increased in recent months, but prices of
industrial goods have declined. The excess supply of industrial products may be
a result of external weakness, which has led some exporters to turn to the
domestic market. After sharp declines earlier in the year, exports recorded slow
but steady growth for the third consecutive month in September, but imports fell
from an unusually high level in August.
Data received since the last FOMC meeting suggest that economic conditions in
Hong Kong continued to deteriorate. The unemployment rate increased to
5.3 percent in the third quarter, the highest level since early last year. The
volume of retail sales was up less than 1 percent in August after plummeting
nearly 7 percent in July. Also indicative of continued weak demand, consumer
prices fell 1.2 percent over the twelve months ended September. Exports and
imports both increased modestly in September, with little change in the trade
balance.

Indicators released over the past month suggest that the recession in Taiwan has
deepened. Unemployment continued its trend upward and industrial production
plummeted nearly 8 percent in September (s.a.). Declines were fairly
widespread across industries, but the information and electronics sectors
suffered the sharpest drop. Exports declined 21 percent in September (s.a.),
reflecting the effects of recent typhoons and, perhaps, the early implications of
the terrorist attacks. Imports fell nearly 8 percent in September, following an
already sharp decline in August, reflecting the weakness in demand, especially
for imported inputs. Consumer prices decreased slightly in September from
their year-earlier levels.
