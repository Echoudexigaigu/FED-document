Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The incoming data have had a somewhat firmer tone in recent weeks than those
available at the time of the last FOMC meeting, but economic activity still
appears to be declining this quarter. The latest readings on initial claims and
insured unemployment are consistent with a further drop in employment in
November on the heels of a sharp contraction in October. The available data
and reports from industry sources suggest another decline in factory production
outside of motor vehicles in November. Sales of new motor vehicles have been
phenomenal, but have been largely accommodated by a drawdown in dealer
stocks. Other household and business spending appears to have recovered
somewhat from the sharp falloff in September but, on balance, remains below
the levels that prevailed last summer. Inflation has moved lower as the result of
falling energy prices, and year-ahead inflation expectations have plunged in
recent months.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market weakened dramatically in October; the unemployment rate
jumped 1/2 percentage point, and private payroll employment dropped 439,000,
the largest one-month decline since 1975. The workweek also decreased, and
aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers fell 0.7 percent.
Almost every major industry shed jobs in October. Manufacturers cut another
142,000 workers in October, bringing the loss over the preceding twelve months
to more than 1.1 million jobs. However, in contrast to the pattern that held
through August, industries outside of manufacturing accounted for the bulk of
October's employment decline. Almost half of all the cuts in non-factory jobs
occurred in travel- and tourism-related industries, in which demand fell abruptly
in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attack.'
More recently, the incoming data on claims for unemployment insurance are
consistent with a further noticeable decline in employment in November-
albeit not as sharp as occurred in October. The four-week moving average of
initial claims stood at 454,000 for the week ended November 24; while that
level was 50,000 below its peak of a month ago, it remained higher than the
average from mid-June to mid-September, when private payrolls declined an
1. In its October release on mass layoffs, the BLS reported mass layoffs (those involving
fifty or more unemployment insurance claims against a firm in one month) due to "non-natural
disasters," a new reason code added to the survey to identify workers separated from a company
as a direct or indirect result of an incident such as the September 11 attack. In the five-week
period following September 11, the BLS estimates that 88,508 workers were affected by mass
layoffs related to the events of September 11. More than 70 percent of the layoffs occurred in
New York, California, Nevada, Illinois, Hawaii, or Texas, and 80 percent of the affected workers
were employed in the air transport or hotel industries.

average of 140,000 per month. Moreover, the four-week moving average of
insured unemployment in mid-November was up substantially from a month
earlier, suggesting that individuals already on the UI rolls are finding new jobs
difficult to obtain. As further evidence of reduced job-finding prospects for the
unemployed, the exhaustion rate-the fraction of insured unemployed who have
exhausted their UI benefits-moved up in October after having been about flat
in recent years.2
Other indicators of labor market conditions have either weakened further
recently or continued to remain at relatively depressed levels. Manpower's
index of net hiring intentions for the first quarter declined again and is
approaching the trough reached in 1991.3 The National Federation of
Independent Businesses' (NFIB) hiring index moved up in November, retracing
the previous month's decline, but was still below its average level this summer;
the NFIB also reported that the number of firms with hard-to-fill positions
dropped to the lowest level since 1993. In the November Conference Board
survey, households had a more negative assessment of current job availability
than at any time since early 1996, while expectations about future employment
prospects, as reported in the Michigan SRC and Conference Board surveys,
remained near the average levels recorded during the 1990-91 recession, despite
having improved somewhat in November.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its advance estimate of productivity
for the third quarter on December 6. Based on the NIPA data released on
November 30 and the data on hours published to date, we estimate that output
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of roughly
1-1/2 percent in the third quarter of 2001. Over the four quarters ended last
quarter, we estimate that productivity rose 1.6 percent; although that rise is
down considerably from the 3.6 percent pace recorded for the year-earlier
period, it is still quite robust given the large deceleration in output over the past
year.
2. More specifically, the exhaustion rate is the ratio of the twelve-month moving average of
the number of insured unemployed who have exhausted their UI benefits to the twelve-month
moving average of the number of unemployed first receiving benefits six months earlier.
Regular unemployment insurance benefits are exhausted after 26 weeks in almost all states.
3. Although the Manpower survey asks employers about their intentions to change the size
of their workforce for the upcoming three months, the index is more highly correlated with the
current situation than employment one quarter ahead.

Industrial Production
Industrial production fell 1.2 percent in October following a 0.9 percent decline
in September. In October, production declines occurred in most market groups
and industries. Motor vehicle assemblies fell 1/2 million units (annual rate) for
the third consecutive month, after having been at relatively elevated rates during
the spring and early summer. Production of high-technology goods dropped
again, and manufacturing output elsewhere continued to be restrained by weak
demand for business equipment, by efforts to pare inventories, and by
competition from abroad.4
The factory operating rate fell again in October to 72.8 percent-lower than the
76.6 percent rate reached in the 1990-91 recession but still above the 69 percent
of December 1982. The current downturn for the high-tech industry has been
particularly severe: After having peaked in May 2000 at 88.8 percent, capacity
utilization at high-tech plants sunk to 59.5 percent in October, even with a
considerable slowdown in the expansion of capacity at those plants.
4. On November 27, the 2001 Annual Revision to Industrial Production and Capacity
Utilization was released. Industrial output and capacity are now reported to have increased at a
slower rate in 1999 and 2000. However, the overall picture portrayed by the updated data is
unchanged. The rate of industrial capacity utilization is little revised at 76.2 percent in the third
quarter of 2001, and the decline in industrial production since it peaked in the middle of last year
is 7.0 percent, 1/2 percentage point more than previously estimated.

Despite having improved, most of the recent data on production, new orders,
and other indicators still point to continued weakness in the industrial sector.
One noticeable plus in November is the production of motor vehicles:
Assemblies rose to about 11-1/2 million units (annual rate) in November, nearly
1 million units higher than in October. Nonetheless, dealer stocks are estimated
to have declined more than 50,000 units (not at an annual rate) from the level at
the end of the third quarter to the end of November and were at the lowest level
since August 1991. Although anecdotal reports indicate that dealer inventories
of 2001 model-year vehicles were liquidated quickly, no reports of shortages of
2002 vehicles have surfaced. Current schedules, as published by Ward's,
suggest little change in the pace of assemblies in December and in the first
quarter of next year from November's rate. However, because of the magnitude
and timing of the drop in sales that likely will accompany the reduction in sales
incentives, the balance of risks to scheduled motor vehicle production early next
year is more heavily weighted on the downside.

II-10
Outside of motor vehicles, the available weekly production series are expected
to make a negative contribution to the November change in total IP. The iron
and steel industry is still reeling from low demand and intense import
competition. Production of lumber continued to decline last month, although
the output of plywood has stepped up some. Electricity generation was down in
November, and production of jet fuel has remained well below its level before
September 11, freeing up capacity that was used to build up stocks of gasoline.
The number of oil and gas rigs in operation declined further in November,
continuing the slide that has been evident since late spring after prices began to
soften appreciably.
Some positive signs may have begun to emerge in the high-tech area. In the
semiconductor industry, the rate of decline in production has lessened: Between
August and October, the output of semiconductors and related devices fell at an
average monthly rate of 0.2 percent, considerably less than the declines of 2 to
3 percent per month in the spring and early summer. According to staff
estimates, inventories of semiconductors have been liquidated at a fast clip since
May, and a survey of large buyers of semiconductors suggests that the gap
between actual days' supply and target days' supply has narrowed from earlier
this year. In the computer industry, the market for servers, which contracted
sharply early this year, may be hitting bottom. Sun Microsystems (the second
largest producer of servers) reported that sales have started to increase, and IBM
(the largest producer of servers) indicated that business is not getting worse. In
contrast, the outlook for the communications equipment industry still looks
grim. Orders rose sharply in October, but to a level that was still below that of
August. Moreover, inventories remain high, and equipment utilization rates at
many telecom-service providers reportedly are quite low.
Other indicators of the manufacturing sector remain weak. For instance,
although real adjusted orders turned up 6.2 percent in October, they had plunged
more than 9 percent in September. In November, the National Association of
Purchasing Management index of new orders bounced back, but still suggested
that the sector was contracting. Announced manufacturing layoffs, which
surged in the aftermath of September 11, were still relatively large at 50,000 in
November.
5. Weekly production data are available for a variety of industries, including motor vehicles,
lumber, plywood, raw steel, steel products, appliances, petroleum products, meat products, coal,
drilling activity, and electricity generation. These weekly series make up about 15 percent of
total industrial production.

Consumer Spending
The staff estimates that real PCE jumped 3 percent in October, as consumers
responded to the zero-rate financing packages offered by the motor vehicle
industry, and spending in other categories partially recovered from the step-
down in September.6 Smoothing through the factors that boosted consumption
growth temporarily in October, consumer spending appears to be moving up at a
modest pace early in the fourth quarter.
Sales of light vehicles surged in October to an annual rate of more than
21 million units in response to aggressive sales incentives offered by
automakers. In November, sales of light vehicles dropped back a bit from the
blistering October pace, but remained at a robust 17.8 million units (annual rate)
-still well above the third-quarter average of 16.1 million units. Although the
initial round of incentives expired in mid-November, pared-back versions of
6. The BEA reported that real PCE increased 2.2 percent in October. In constructing that
estimate, the BEA allocated a lower proportion of the sales of light motor vehicles to consumers
than we believe-based on confidential information on deliveries to fleet companies-actually
occurred. Using the staff estimate of the split in sales between households and businesses boosts
our monthly estimate of real PCE to 3 percent; our forecast of business spending was adjusted
accordingly, leaving no significant effect of the shift in assumed shares on our estimate of real
GDP in the fourth quarter.

these packages were extended and are likely to remain in place through early
next year.7
Consumer spending on goods other than motor vehicles rebounded 1-3/4 percent
in October to a level that, while still short of the August reading, was about
1/4 percent above the third-quarter average. The recovery in this category was
led by a rise in spending on durable goods, which more than reversed the steep
drop in September. In contrast, outlays for nondurable goods posted only a
modest gain and remained below the August level. A pickup in outlays for
consumer services in October was also noticeable. In part, the over-the-month
increase was boosted by an some revival in spending on travel-related services,
such as hotels and airlines, which had plunged in September. However, the
upturn in spending in these areas was modest, leaving the October levels below
their third-quarter averages. Spending on energy services also picked up
slightly after a steep drop in September. More fundamentally, the uptrend in
outlays for services not directly affected by the events of September 11-such
as medical care and education-was fairly well maintained through October.
Available indicators for November point to a more lackluster pace of spending
than in October. According to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, chain store sales
came in at or below retailers' admittedly modest plans last month. Generally
mild temperatures (relative to seasonal norms) around the country probably led
to a sizable drop in spending on energy services. Data from the Department of
Energy indicate that real gasoline purchases moved up a little in November.
The volume of stock-market transactions edged down last month, suggesting
slightly lower outlays on investment counseling and brokerage fees. Finally,
information from the airline industry is consistent with some additional recovery
in this area.
On the income side, without the significant boost that had been provided
through September from this summer's tax rebates and with the labor market
having softened further, real disposable personal income dropped
2.4 percent in October. Indeed, the result would have been worse if not for
some relief provided by the sharp decline in consumer energy prices that month.
The recent pickup in equity values, if sustained, would raise the ratio of
household net worth to disposable income to near the level registered early this
year, albeit still down considerably from its peak in the spring of 2000.
After having dropped in September, indicators of consumer sentiment have been
somewhat mixed. The Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of
consumer sentiment edged higher for a second consecutive month in November
7. For example, GM announced that zero-interest financing will be available until January 2,
but it is restricted to certain models. In addition, discounted financing for longer-term loans is
now less favorable. Ford and DaimlerChrysler also have incentive programs scheduled to expire
in early to mid-January.

while the Conference Board's (CB) index of consumer confidence fell again.
Monthly movements aside, the surveys seem to be well aligned when considered
over a longer time span. For example, in November, both the CB and SRC
measures were noticeably lower than in early summer, the time of their most
recent peaks; both measures have also registered similar-sized declines over the
past year or so, having fallen to below-average levels in November from their
near-historical peaks in the fall of 2000.
Housing Markets
Although the level of homebuilding continued to moderate in October, it
remained relatively high, supported by historically low mortgage rates.8 Starts
of single-family homes declined 1-1/4 percent in October to an annual rate of
1.24 million units; although down from the pace of construction earlier this
year, the latest reading was close to the average level in 2000 and off only
modestly from the averages that prevailed in 1998 and 1999. One note of
caution, however, is that adjusted permits for single-family construction
decreased another 2-1/4 percent in October, after a 4-1/4 percent drop in
September; given the pace of starts, the backlog of unused single-family permits
held by builders came down further. Taken together, the latest readings on
permits and backlogs suggest that the starts estimate for October somewhat
overstates the strength of activity in the industry.9
Sales of new homes were essentially unchanged in October at an annual rate of
880,000 units and have held relatively steady since May. Sales of existing
homes rebounded 5-1/2 percent to 5.2 million units in October; the rise reversed
half of the sharp decline in September and likely reflected some closings that
had been postponed after September 11.
Recent indicators of housing demand in November have given somewhat
inconsistent readings. For example, in November, the four-week moving
average for the Mortgage Bankers Association index of purchase applications
for home mortgages recovered a considerable part of its decline between June
and late October. Similarly, by November, the Michigan survey's measure of
households' attitudes toward home buying had largely retraced its third-quarter
8. In October, the average rate on fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) declined to 6.60 percent,
which is the lowest level to date for the Freddie Mac series, which begins in early 1971. The
average rate on adjustable-rate mortgages declined in October to 5.26 percent, the lowest in
7-1/2 years. The FRM rate edged up to 6.68 percent in November and edged above 7 percent
last week.
9. The monthly permits estimate is based on a sample that is nine times as large as the
sample that underlies the starts estimate, and tests by Census show that the single-family permits
series is subject to substantially lower statistical error than the series for single-family starts.
Reflecting these differences, single-family starts typically adjust toward a better alignment
with permits rather than the reverse. Empirically, the lagged deviation between starts and
permits has significant predictive power for the change in starts but not for the change in
permits.

decline, and traffic of potential buyers in both new and existing homes has
recovered considerably from the weak readings in September and October. In
contrast, builders' ratings of new home sales-which have for some time been
more pessimistic than actual sales- remained near a five-year low in
November, and builders indicated a reduction in planned starts for the rest of
this year and the first half of next year.10
In the multifamily sector, starts declined 1-1/2 percent in October to an annual
rate of 310,000 units, which is toward the lower end of the range over the past
two years. Even so, conditions in the market for multifamily rental units remain
relatively favorable for construction. Over the year ending in the third quarter,
the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units has held steady at a fairly low level,
and with a twelve-month increase of 4.6 percent in October, the CPI for
residential rent has been rising much more rapidly than overall consumer prices.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real outlays for equipment and software fell at an
annual rate of 9.3 percent in the third quarter and appear headed for a somewhat
larger decline this quarter. However, the latest data suggest that some of the
steep decline in orders and shipments in September likely reflected a pause in
activity after September 11, rather than additional underlying weakness.
New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased
6.5 percent in October after having declined 10 percent in September. Bookings
for office and computing equipment were up more than 18 percent, and
bookings for communications equipment were up nearly 62 percent. Total
orders for high-tech equipment moved above their August levels but remained
lower than in July. Outside of the high-tech sector, orders ticked down in the
aggregate. However, in a number of categories, such as industrial machinery
and metalworking machinery, orders advanced after steep falloffs in September.
Meanwhile, shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved up
1.4 percent in October on the heels of a 5 percent drop in the previous month.
Most sectors recorded increases in October. Notably, shipments of office and
computing equipment rose for the second straight month, after having declined
sharply for most of the year. Overall, the level of shipments for nondefense
capital goods (excluding aircraft) has been running above new orders since
10. In early November, the National Association of Home Builders asked 380 builders
whether, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, they had made any change in their plans
for housing starts for the fourth quarter of this year or for the first half of 2002. About one-
fourth of them indicated having reduced the number of housing starts planned for the fourth
quarter of this year and the first half of next year. In both periods, the median amount of the
intended curtailment of starts was 20 percent. These results are roughly consistent with the
results of similar survey questions that were asked in early October.

January, and as a result, the backlog of unfilled orders has moved below its
level of a year ago.
Demand for commercial aircraft is expected to remain depressed. Airbus plans
to revise down its production schedules in 2002 to 300 deliveries of planes,
down from 320 planes in 2001. However, many analysts believe Airbus will be
forced to cut production below 290 planes, and some estimates run as low as
250 planes. Boeing has not announced any further reductions for 2002
subsequent to the steep reductions that the company announced in October.
Business demand for motor vehicles has continued to weaken this quarter. With
travel down sharply in recent months, some rental companies have announced
their intention to reduce their stocks of vehicles. Although confidential data
from automakers indicate that fleet sales rebounded in November from their
sharp drop in October, average sales over the past two months were well below
the 3 million-unit sales rate in the third quarter. Sales of medium and heavy
trucks also popped up in October after having fallen sharply in September.
Nevertheless, sales of these vehicles have declined for the past seven quarters,
and part of the October jump probably reflects activity that was postponed in
September.
Nonresidential construction. Real outlays for the construction of
nonresidential buildings increased 1.7 percent in October but were down more
than 6 percent from the third-quarter average, following a 5.8 percent drop in
the third quarter (not at annual rate)."
For office buildings and other commercial structures, the declines in
expenditures seen in the third quarter were partly reversed in October. Outlays
for both types of structures rose 4.2 percent in real terms. According to updated
estimates from CB Richard Ellis, a leading real estate brokerage, consulting,
and information company, the vacancy rate for office buildings in downtown
areas and in suburban locations jumped again in the third quarter, reaching
10.4 percent and 13 percent respectively. The latest vacancy rates, while up
sharply from levels a year ago, are in a moderate range by historical standards.
11. The staff estimates that real investment in nonresidential structures declined at an annual
rate of 6.9 percent in the third quarter; this figure incorporates revisions to construction
expenditures in August and September that were not reflected in the preliminary GDP estimate
for investment in nonresidential structures, which was reported to have declined 9.3 percent at an
annual rate. Third-quarter expenditures would have been weaker but for the long-term lease in
July of the World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York to two private companies.
This transaction was treated by the BEA as a purchase of property by private nonresidential
business. Excluding this special factor, private construction spending would have shown a
decline at nearly a 21 percent rate last quarter. The boost to nonresidential investment spending
from the asset sale was offset by a reduction in spending by state and local governments and
therefore had no effect on GDP.

For industrial structures, real construction expenditures dropped 9.5 percent in
October. According to CB Richard Ellis, the vacancy rate for industrial
buildings increased to 9.5 percent in the third quarter, the highest on record (the
series dates back to 1984).
Investment expenditures for drilling and mining declined at an annual rate of
5.2 percent in the third quarter (latest data) compared with a jump in the second
quarter of nearly 34 percent. As noted earlier, the number of oil and gas drilling
rigs in operation has edged down in recent months as prices have declined
significantly.
Inventories
According to the preliminary GDP report, the real stock of nonfarm inventories
declined at an annual rate of $57 billion in the third quarter, which was nearly
as large as the runoff in the first two quarters combined. Excluding motor
vehicle inventories, which increased slightly last quarter, constant-dollar
inventories fell at an annual rate of $60 billion. Manufacturing shipments and
wholesale and retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) in real terms declined in
the third quarter as well; accordingly, the aggregate inventory-sales ratio only
edged down from its second-quarter level.
The book value of manufacturers' inventories dropped at an annual rate of
$48.4 billion in September. Although inventories declined in nearly every
durable and nondurable industry grouping in September, many stock-to-sales
ratios nonetheless rose sharply further. Even in the few industries in which
inventory-shipments ratios did move down, stocks remained quite high relative
to shipments. More recent information indicates that inventories held by
durable goods manufacturers, which constitute about two-thirds of the total
manufacturing inventory stock, fell at an annual rate of $15 billion in October.
Inventory-shipments ratios moved down a bit from the high levels recorded in
September in most durable goods categories.
The book value of wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles decreased at
an annual rate of $12 billion in September. Stocks declined in most durable
goods categories, although not by as much as sales. In most nondurable goods
sectors, inventories fell or were little changed. However, because of robust
stock-building by drug wholesalers, nondurable goods in aggregate recorded an
increase in inventories, and the inventory-sales ratio increased for the second
consecutive month.
The book value of retail inventories excluding motor vehicles declined at an
annual rate of $6 billion in September. Because non-auto retail sales fell
1.3 percent in September, the inventory-sales ratio jumped despite the
liquidation in stocks.

1. A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, or
when the first three days of a month are nonworking days. Outlays for defense, social security,
Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.

Government Sector
Federal. The federal government recorded a $9 billion unified deficit during
October 2001. Although this deficit is slightly smaller than the year-earlier
figure ($11 billion), the reduction is more than explained by special factors that
boosted receipts to a level 16 percent above last October. In particular, the
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 allowed
corporations to shift about $23 billion in estimated payments from September
15 to October 1, and an extra business day this October added roughly
$5 billion to receipts. Excluding these special factors, receipts this October
were slightly below a year earlier, and the unified deficit would have been
$37 billion.
Adjusted for routine timing shifts, outlays were nearly 9 percent higher in
October than they were twelve months earlier. While defense spending was up
about 10 percent, an increase of this magnitude was expected before September
11, suggesting that the terrorism-related operations did not have a material
effect on October outlays. Outlays for Medicaid and income security also rose
briskly.

1. Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.
The Congress has been grappling with several fiscal initiatives. President Bush
signed a bill that federalizes approximately 28,000 airport security personnel at
an annual budget cost of roughly $2 billion.12 This outlay will be financed by a
ticket surcharge of up to $10 per roundtrip.
12. The bill stipulates that the federal takeover be phased in over the next year. Two years
after the plan is fully phased in, airports may opt out of the federal system and re-hire private
contractors.

After the House passed a Republican fiscal stimulus package in October, a
proposal developed by Democrats stalled in the Senate. Congressional leaders
have agreed to a framework for negotiations designed to bridge the gaps
between these two plans. A package developed by Senate moderates may form
the basis for a compromise. This bipartisan plan includes investment
incentives, new rebate checks, unemployment-related benefits, and accelerated
implementation of the recently enacted tax cuts.
Completion of the regular fiscal 2002 appropriations process is still being held
up by disputes over additional emergency spending. The House has attached
$20 billion to its fiscal 2002 defense spending bill. However, Senate Democrats
want to increase emergency-related spending by somewhat more-about
$35 billion-and the Administration has threatened to veto those larger
increases. As negotiations continue, the Congress has passed a continuing
resolution that provides funding for programs without completed appropriations
bills through December 15.
State and local governments. Although pressures on budgets are intensifying,
state and local consumption and investment purchases continued at a robust
pace in the early part of the fourth quarter.13 Real construction put-in-place
jumped 2-3/4 percent (monthly rate) in October, to a level more than 13 percent
above the level at the end of 2000. Meanwhile, hiring was well maintained in
October; the addition of 27,000 jobs in October came on the heels of a rapid
57,000 average monthly rise in the third quarter.
Looking ahead, state governments continue to report that revenues have been
coming in below expectations, and many are working out strategies that will
allow them to finish the current fiscal year with their budgets in balance. Until
recently, the proposed remedies focused on reducing planned expenditures,
dipping into budget-stabilization (so-called rainy-day) funds, and funding some
additional capital projects with debt rather than current receipts. More recently,
however, several state governments have indicated a willingness to consider tax
hikes or the postponement of tax reductions.
An October survey of city governments by the National League of Cities
reported that many jurisdictions, faced with widening imbalances in their
budgets, expect to draw down reserves and constrain the rise in expenditures.
Many are concerned about the added costs of heightened public safety and
security measures that have coincided with a slowdown in revenue collections.
Nonetheless, only a few cities suggested that they would consider higher taxes
or fees.
13. Note that in the fourth quarter, the change in state and local purchases, as measured in
the NIPA, will be boosted as investment spending returns to the level recorded before the World
Trade Center was transferred, as discussed earlier, to the private sector.

Prices and Labor Costs
Prices.
With energy prices resuming their downward slide in October, the twelve-
month change in the consumer price index slowed to 2.1 percent, down from a
3.4 percent increase over the preceding twelve months. October's reading was
the lowest twelve-month change in more than two years. The CPI excluding
food and energy has risen 2.6 percent since October 2000, up marginally from
the change over the year-earlier period, while the twelve-month change in core
PCE prices was 1.6 percent in October, down from 1.9 percent over the
preceding twelve months.14 The deceleration in core PCE prices contrasts with
the essentially flat pattern of core CPI inflation over the past year. The
difference is largely due to the wider scope of the PCE series, which includes a
number of categories with non-market-based prices (such as imputed bank
service charges) that have decelerated sharply over the past year.
The CPI for energy fell sharply in October, reflecting large declines for prices
of motor fuel, heating oil, and natural gas. Survey data indicate that gasoline
and heating oil prices fell further in November. These declines partly reflect the
roughly $2.50 per barrel drop in spot prices of crude oil last month. In addition,
energy inventories are generally in good shape. Gasoline stocks have remained
on the high side of the seasonal norm, and margins have dropped back to more-
normal levels. The winter heating season has begun in far better shape than a
year ago: Inventories of both natural gas and heating oil are much higher than
last year's levels. As a result, spot prices for natural gas in recent weeks have
fallen back to levels last seen in late 1999. Retail electricity prices have begun
to edge down in recent months, reflecting the lower cost of natural gas inputs.
The consumer price index for food rose 0.5 percent in October, bringing the
twelve-month change to 3.4 percent-1.0 percentage point higher than a year
earlier. However, the USDA's index of prices received by farmers has declined
sharply over the past few months after having posted a series of increases
earlier this year, and this week's futures quotes suggest that farm prices will
continue to decline moderately next year. These developments are likely to
slow the increases in retail food prices over the coming months.
14. Core PCE prices jumped 1.2 percent in October, more than reversing the decline in
September that was caused by the BEA's treatment of insurance payments; the twelve-month
change in October was no longer affected. These insurance adjustments affected the third-
quarter GDP chain-type price index, which increased 2.2 percent according to the preliminary
GDP release. As we reported previously, this measure of price inflation was boosted
approximately 0.9 percentage point in the third quarter by the BEA's treatment of insurance
payments, while PCE chain-type price inflation was reduced 1.1 percentage points. The BEA
adjusted nominal imports of insurance services in a manner that reduced the import price
deflator, and this adjustment had a larger effect on GDP prices than did the associated downward
adjustment to PCE prices.

II-35
In October, the CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent for the fourth
consecutive month. Prices of commodities excluding food and energy edged
down in October after having risen 0.3 percent in September. The recent
changes have been influenced importantly by changes in tobacco prices;
excluding tobacco, the index for core commodities edged up 0.1 percent in both
September and October.15 Over the year ending in October, prices of core
commodities excluding tobacco declined 1/2 percent.
Prices for non-energy services increased 0.2 percent in October after having
risen 0.1 percent in September. The increases in September and October were
held down by large declines in prices for airfares and for lodging away from
home. Although these categories tend to be volatile, the recent softness is
consistent with anecdotal reports of weakness in tourism and travel. In contrast,
the CPIs for both owners' equivalent rent and tenants' rent advanced
0.4 percent. Compared with October 2000, the twelve-month changes in these
two indexes have accelerated 1 percentage point and 1/2 percentage point,
respectively, to 4.2 percent and 4.5 percent.
Prices for capital goods, as measured by the PPI, fell 0.7 percent in October.
This decline-the largest monthly drop in more than forty years-was mainly
the result of falling prices for motor vehicles. Unlike the CPI, the PPI takes
financing incentives into account when measuring producer prices for motor
vehicles. Prices for communications equipment continued their recent slide in
October, falling 0.6 percent. Computer prices are reported to have risen slightly
in October, but this increase follows two large monthly declines. Over the past
three months, computer prices have plunged at an annual rate of more than
40 percent.
Recent price changes at earlier stages of processing have been mixed. The
producer price index for core intermediate materials fell 0.4 percent in October.
Over the twelve months ending in October, this index declined 1.2 percent,
compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the preceding twelve months. The PPI
for core crude materials dropped 11 percent over the year through mid-October.
However, indexes of industrial materials prices have turned up over the past
month. The CRB spot industrial price index is up 4 percent since the time of
the last Greenbook; the Journal of Commerce index, which has been held down
by the decline in energy prices, increased 1 percent over this period.
Near-term inflation expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan
survey, moved down further in November after a surprisingly large drop in
October. The latest survey put the median expectation for inflation in the
coming year at 0.4 percent, down from 2.8 percent in September and 1 percent
15. The CPI does not include auto financing charges and, thus, has not been affected by the
recent round of aggressive incentives. Indeed, reported consumer prices for new motor vehicles
rose a touch in October.

in October-the largest two-month decline in the history of the series, which
began in 1978. Inflation expectations fell almost as sharply in late 1981, but
that episode occurred during a period of ongoing disinflation that followed
double-digit inflation rates; by contrast, the recent declines occurred suddenly,
after a long period of relatively stable inflation expectations. The underlying
survey data show that the drop in the median expectation was largely the result
of a big increase in the fraction of respondents who are expecting inflation to be
either zero or negative over the next year.16 In contrast to the plunge in the
year-ahead expectations, longer-term inflation expectations have moved down
only a little in recent months.
Labor costs. We have received little new information on labor costs since the
last Greenbook. Based on the GDP release, we expect that compensation per
hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in
the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the only figures we have in hand are
average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which edged
up 0.1 percent in October. Since October 2000, this measure of wages has
increased 4.1 percent, a touch above the year-earlier reading. Nevertheless,
average hourly earnings have decelerated in recent months, increasing at an
annual rate of 3.7 percent over the three months ending in October. Concerning
benefits, anecdotal reports continue to point to further sizable increases in
employers' health insurance costs. For example, a recent Towers Perrin survey
reported an average increase of 13 percent in health care premiums for active
employees for 2002.
16. In fact, 53 percent of Michigan survey respondents reported that they expect prices to
stay the same or go down over the next year. The reported median inflation series has remained
positive, however, because the SRC interpolates integer responses when calculating this series.
For example, respondents who expect prices to be flat are distributed evenly between
-0.5 percent and 0.5 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Data released over the intermeeting period, though mixed, were on balance
stronger than expected and were read by market participants as providing some
assurance that economic activity would turn up next year sufficiently for
monetary policy to start to tighten substantially. The steepening trajectory of
policy expectations and reduced concerns about the economy and credit risk,
which were reinforced by developments in Afghanistan, prompted a run-up in
Treasury yields, a rise in stock prices, and a narrowing of credit spreads.
Nonfinancial corporations once again issued a considerable volume of long-term
debt, including some offerings by speculative-grade firms. The Treasury also
was a heavy borrower, as tax receipts flagged and spending surged. Household
borrowing remained robust, supported mainly by elevated mortgage borrowing,
but also by loans arising from a surge in light vehicle sales.
Policy Expectations, Interest Rates, and Equity Prices
Rates on federal funds futures contracts imply that investors are virtually certain
of a further quarter-point easing at the December meeting and now expect that
the funds rate next year will rise more than they had anticipated at the time of
the last FOMC meeting. Judging from implied volatility derived from options
on interest rate futures, however, it also seems that investors' sense of
uncertainty about this outlook, and the associated steeper path for monetary
policy, remains quite elevated relative to recent years.
The more upbeat view of economic prospects and the associated firmer expected
trajectory for monetary policy boosted Treasury coupon yields 30 to 40 basis
points over the intermeeting period. Market participants cited military successes
in Afghanistan as contributing to some unwinding of safe-haven demands.
Moreover, a small part of the rise in Treasury yields probably owed to some
reduction of the scarcity premiums that had been built into those yields
immediately following the Treasury's announcement on October 31 of the
suspension of the thirty-year security. Yields on Treasury inflation-indexed
securities rose nearly as much as nominal yields, as inflation compensation
remained subdued. Investment-grade corporate yields rose as well, but to a
lesser extent than Treasuries. Junk bond yields actually fell appreciably, pulling
risk spreads on these securities well below their levels on September 11.
Broad equity indexes gained about 4 percent over the intermeeting period, and
the Nasdaq rose 9-1/2 percent. These advances occurred even though equity
analysts continued to revise down their forecasts of S&P 500 earnings for the
year ahead and over longer horizons. The combination of rising stock prices
and downward revisions to the earnings outlook imply that equity valuations
again are very rich by historical standards.

Business Finance
Rising share prices encouraged a moderate pickup in gross equity issuance from
the depressed third-quarter level. Recent issues have been concentrated in the
energy and health care sectors. The number of firms scheduled to go public in
the near future stayed at a low level relative to past years.
The level of bond rates remained attractive for investment-grade firms, which
floated $43 billion of bonds in November, exceeding October's rapid pace.
Many investment-grade firms continued to use bond proceeds to pay down
short-term obligations, to refinance higher-coupon debt, and to build cash
positions.
Although high-yield bond spreads fell more than a percentage point over the
intermeeting period, they remain at elevated levels similar to those of the early
1990s. Currently, these spreads appear to be more closely aligned with their
historical relationships to fundamentals, such as expected defaults, than in the
wake of the terrorist attacks. While issuance in this market has been somewhat
subdued, firms that are able to tell a convincing story about profitability
reportedly can still receive financing.
Evidently, corporate bond market participants are looking beyond the recent
news showing a continued erosion in corporate credit quality. The twelve-
month trailing average of junk bond defaults rose to a record 14 percent in
October, up from 13 percent in September. Expected default frequencies in the
year ahead remained very elevated, and ratings downgrades were widespread.
Significantly, AT&T was downgraded one notch to A3/A- by both Moody's and
S&P's at the end of October, an action that affected some $53 billion of
outstanding debt. Enron filed for bankruptcy in early December after its debt
had been downgraded six notches to junk. With liabilities reportedly greater
than $20 billion, it is the largest bankruptcy filing to date.
Credit spreads for A2/P2 commercial paper issuers narrowed over most of the
intermeeting period, but then moved up sharply as Enron's downgrades made
investors more skittish about holding paper over year-end. Prior to Enron, year-
end premiums for A2/P2 issuers had been running a bit higher than at the same
time last year. While top-tier (A1/P1) firms face little in the way of year-end
premiums, they continued to shrink their paper programs over the intermeeting
period. In November, total domestic nonfinancial commercial paper
outstanding fell another $2-1/2 billion, leaving outstandings down about $100
billion, or 30 percent, this year.
In contrast to the nonfinancial segment of the market, asset-backed commercial
paper has grown rapidly all year. Anecdotal reports indicate that firms are
making more intensive use of these conduits to liquefy assets and build cash
positions going into year-end. Notably, the financing arms of Ford and GMAC,

both recently downgraded to tier-2 status in the CP market, have apparently
ramped up their asset-backed commercial paper (which remains tier-1 rated) as
well as some longer-term asset-backed funding, in part to finance light vehicle
receivables acquired through sales-incentives programs.
Commercial Real Estate
The growth of commercial mortgage debt-including debt securitized through
CMBS issues-appears to be slowing somewhat in the current quarter from the
rapid third-quarter pace. Although vacancy rates have risen, delinquency rates
on commercial mortgages at commercial banks are up only a bit, and they
remain at low levels. Credit spreads in the CMBS market were little changed
over the intermeeting period.
Household Finance
Fixed-rate residential mortgage rates hit a low in the second week of November,
with the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 6.45 percent. Low rates
boosted the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) refinancing index and also
reversed the recent downward trend of the MBA purchase index. More recently,
rates have climbed back closer to 7 percent, responding to the rise in longer-
term Treasury yields. Overall, residential mortgage growth in the fourth quarter
is estimated to be a little weaker than in the third quarter, while aggressive
automotive financing incentives appear to be supporting consumer credit growth
this quarter. As a result, the household debt-service burden likely will move
back up to the level recorded in the first half of the year, after having
temporarily fallen in the third quarter when the distribution of the income tax
rebate boosted income.
On balance, the latest readings on household credit quality show a little further
deterioration over the third quarter. While the delinquency rate on home
mortgages on the books of commercial banks came down slightly, the MBA
delinquency rate ticked up, and the delinquency rates for subprime borrowers,
measured by the Mortgage Information Corporation, moved up substantially.
Movements in credit card delinquency rates in the third quarter were mixed,
with the rate on pools of securitized receivables falling slightly and that on
credit card debt held at commercial banks inching up. Personal bankruptcy
filing rates also moved up slightly in November.
The ratio of household assets to disposable income is likely to rebound some in
the fourth quarter, given recent stock market gains. Flows into domestic bond
funds strengthened in October and appear to have continued in November. The
flow of assets out of equity funds stopped in October, and data for November
suggest a rebound, perhaps an indication of some reversal in household
sentiment toward risk. A fair amount of caution persists, however, as the equity
share of new contributions to 401(k) pension plans declined in October, and

Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury's net borrowing in marketable debt so far in the fourth quarter is
well above its announced target of $31 billion. To meet financing needs, the
Treasury stepped up gross weekly bill offerings to $55 billion in late November,
the highest level ever. Part of the increase reflects the use of the four-week bill
to meet seasonal fluctuations in the Treasury's financing needs that, in past
years, were financed instead through cash management bills.
After the Treasury's October 31 announcement of the suspension of issuance of
thirty-year bonds, bid-ask spreads on outstanding bonds initially widened
considerably amid the sharp price movements that followed the announcement.
While those spreads have since narrowed as the market has digested the news,
liquidity in the bond sector nevertheless reportedly remains below the level that
prevailed prior to the Treasury's announcement.
The settlement process in the Treasury market seems to be operating more
smoothly. The volume of fails-to-deliver, which surged in September and early
October, has dropped off sharply, although it remains above the levels seen in
recent years. The increment may partly reflect the low levels of Treasury repo
rates, which have limited the costs of failing to deliver Treasury securities.
Despite the Treasury's cancellation of the thirty-year bond, neither Freddie Mac
nor Fannie Mae has indicated that it intends to step up issuance of thirty-year
bonds to fill the void. Heavy prepayments on mortgage-backed securities
prompted by low interest rates have apparently led to more cautious issuance of
longer-term debt. The past strategy of issuing long-term debt and then taking
positions in the swap market to pay a floating rate and receive a fixed-rate to
shorten the duration of their liabilities is no longer viable because yields on
long-term agency debt have been above long-term swap rates for some time
now.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross offerings of long-term municipal bonds in November were large, though
below the exceptional pace in October, as low interest rates continue to provide
a boost to issuance.
Although the credit quality of most state and local governments remains high,
signs of weakness have emerged. Many states have reported that revenues are
failing to meet projections, with some indicating that they expect to dip into
their reserve funds to make up for lower-than-expected revenues. In line with
these reports, broad measures suggest that the credit quality of municipal bond
issuers may be topping out. The pace of net credit-rating upgrades has slowed,

and the ratio of thirty-year revenue bond yields to Moody's Aaa yield rose
slightly over the intermeeting period. Significant problems continue to plague
California and New York. In late November, Moody's downgraded California
from Aa3 to A1, citing both declining tax revenues and the protracted electricity
crisis. Moody's also downgraded the general obligation debt of New York City
in November, based on high estimates of the clean-up costs from the terrorist
attacks.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 was flat in October, apparently reflecting a substantial unwinding of
distortions generated by the September 11 terrorist attacks; preliminary data for
November indicate somewhat slower growth than the rapid pace for the year as
a whole. In the face of continued impetus from past reductions in the
opportunity cost of M2, the deceleration likely reflects weak nominal income
and perhaps a bit of continued payback from September.
Over recent months, patterns of M2 growth have been driven mainly by liquid
deposits and retail money funds. Liquid deposits increased sharply following
the September 11 attacks, owing to involuntary asset accumulation from
payment systems disruptions and to safe-haven demands. Through October,
retail money fund growth remained quite strong, as households were initially
leery of equity markets following the attacks. As the outlook improved and
equity markets rallied, some of this preference for safety apparently has waned,
leaving November retail money fund growth moderate.
After declining in October, bank credit picked up moderately in November,
based on preliminary data. However, business loans in November continued to
contract, in part reflecting the sluggish economy, but also a substitution toward
longer-term financing. Loans to the household sector continue to be robust.
Although bank asset quality has deteriorated generally, most delinquency and
charge-off rates are still substantially below the rates observed during the
1990-91 recession. Looking forward, recent Call Report data suggest that banks
expect further erosion of credit quality and, possibly, higher charge-offs, as
indicated by the relatively high rate of loan-loss provisioning.

Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services dropped sharply to a little less than
$19 billion in September from $27 billion in August. However, the decline was
entirely the result of the recording of estimated future payments by foreign
insurers related to the events of September 11, which reduced reported service
imports by $11 billion. Net of this effect, the trade deficit widened by about
$2 billion in September, as exports fell 8 1/2 percent while imports excluding the
insurance payment were down 4 percent

The events of September 11 had several distinct impacts on trade. Both exports
and imports of services, particularly passenger fares and other travel
expenditures, were down significantly in September. Goods trade also fell as a
result of temporary disruptions after the 11th and weakening activity both at
home and abroad. Declines in exports in September were widespread among
categories, with a particularly sharp drop in capital goods. Decreases were also
recorded in almost all major categories of imports, with the notable exception of
consumer goods, which rose slightly.
For the third quarter as a whole the deficit was $300 billion (s.a.a.r.), down from
$355 billion in the second quarter. About three-quarters of this reduction
($44 billion annualized) resulted from the September insurance payment
described above.

IV-5
Imports of goods and services net of the insurance payment were down about 20
percent at an annual rate. Declines were widespread among regions and
categories, with the largest reductions in capital goods and industrial supplies
(oil and non-oil). Imports of consumer goods and of services were down by
smaller amounts.
Exports of goods and services were down about 20 percent at an annual rate for
the quarter, as a moderate decline in the July-August period preceded the sharper
drop in September. The third-quarter falloff in goods exports, which was
somewhat less in dollar terms than the fall in imports, was also widespread, with
steep declines for the second consecutive quarter in both capital goods and
industrial supplies. Exports of consumer goods, which have generally held up
better than other categories this year, also fell sharply in the third quarter, while
service exports were reduced by the curtailment of foreign travel. In contrast,
automotive trade, both exports and imports, rose in the third quarter.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. Following the September terrorist attacks, spot oil prices fell sharply amid
concerns about weak world oil demand resulting from prospects for reduced
economic activity and lower jet fuel consumption. For the third quarter on
average, the price of imported oil fell 17 percent at an annual rate, marginally
faster than in the second quarter but much less than in the first quarter. In
October, the price of imported oil dropped 15.7 percent, the largest decline since
1991, and the spot price of West Texas Intermediate moved lower again in
November following OPEC's decision not to cut production unless several non-
OPEC countries limit production as well. It is not yet clear what impact
Russia's recent decision to restrain oil exports will have on the market. The spot
price of WTI has recently been trading near $20 per barrel.
Non-oil imports. The average price of imported non-oil goods fell in October,
the ninth consecutive month in which the index either fell or was unchanged.
The price index for core goods also dropped, led by a continued downturn in
prices for industrial supplies and materials (particularly natural gas, nonferrous
metals, and lumber). In contrast, there were small increases in prices of
automotive products and imported capital equipment (excluding computers and
semiconductors), for the second consecutive month. For the third quarter, the
average price of core goods fell just over 6 percent at an annual rate, about the
same rate of decline as in the second quarter. The decline was again led by
decreases in prices of imported industrial supplies, with smaller price declines
recorded in all other major trade categories.
Exports. Prices of U.S. goods exports (total and core) fell sharply in October
following small increases in September. The October decline was the largest

IV-6
since January 1998, and marked a resumption of the downward trend that has
been evident since the beginning of this year. Prices of both industrial supplies
and agricultural exports showed particularly sharp declines in October. In the
third quarter, the price of exported core goods declined 2.1 percent at an annual
rate, a bit steeper fall than in the second quarter. Although the price of exported
industrial supplies fell more sharply than in the second quarter, this was partly
offset by an increase in the price of agricultural exports, which had fallen in the
second quarter.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Foreign official assets held in the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions Table) increased $17 billion in the third quarter.
Increases recorded for the BIS ($8 billion) and for Brazil, China, and Taiwan
($3 billion) more than offset sizable declines in the reserves of Germany
($6 billion) and Venezuela ($5 billion). Partial data from FRBNY indicate that
as of mid-November foreign official holdings increased $13 billion since the end
of September. This increase was overwhelmingly due to a further rise in Japan's
holdings ($11 billion), stemming from intervention activity late in the third
quarter.
Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) fell substantially in the
third quarter. Foreign sales of Treasury issues (line 4a) accelerated; however,
the largest declines in net purchases came in U.S. corporate bonds and stocks
(lines 4c and 4d). The falloff was particularly sharp in September and likely
came in the wake of the terrorist attacks; however, our data do not provide
information on the timing of September market activity. In that month,
purchases of agencies and corporate bonds trailed down and foreigners resumed
selling U.S. Treasury securities. In sharp contrast to previous periods, foreigners
also sold $10 billion of U.S. equities in September-the first monthly sales
recorded since September 1998. Although the sales were widespread, they
loomed largest in the financial centers in Europe ($5 billion) and the Caribbean
($4 billion). For the quarter, foreign demand for U.S. agency bonds (line 4b)
remained strong, and net purchases of agencies are on track to exceed last year's
total.
The reduced inflows owing to smaller net foreign purchases of U.S. securities in
the third quarter ($50 billion) were more than offset by a downward swing in
U.S. purchases of foreign securities as U.S. net purchases of $44 billion in the
second quarter turned to sales of $21 billion in the third. Net sales of foreign
bonds, amounting to $25 billion (line 5a), were offset in small part by net
acquisitions of foreign stock, including stock swaps. U.S. residents have been
selling foreign bonds since March, but these sales accelerated markedly during
the third quarter and remained concentrated in European financial centers. U.S.

IV-7
residents also sold net $5 billion of foreign stock in September (line 5c) in
contrast to steady net purchases since the end of last year.
Data on U.S. international securities transactions for October, together with any
revisions to earlier months, are expected in early December and will be included
in the Greenbook Supplement. These data may give some indication of whether
the falloff in foreign demand for U.S. securities in September was a short-lived
reaction to events or a signal of change in investor sentiment.
Net outflows of $15 billion were recorded in the banking sector (line 3); these
largely arose from transactions with unaffiliated foreign banks.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the trade-weighted index of the dollar's exchange value against
other major currencies rose 0.3 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar
appreciated during the first half of the period largely in reaction to data releases
supporting some optimism about prospects for economic activity in the United
States, particularly relative to other foreign industrial economies. In addition,
positive developments in the Afghanistan war, which prompted expectations that
the U.S. military engagement may end sooner than had been anticipated, also
seemed to support the dollar. The dollar subsequently retraced most of its gains
as market participants reassessed their outlook for the U.S. economy following
the release of weaker-than-expected data on consumer confidence and initial
jobless claims in the United States.

The index of the dollar's value against our other important trading partners, in
contrast, fell 0.75 percent over the intermeeting period, led by an appreciation of
the Brazilian real and Korean won. The appreciation of the real occurred
despite an increasingly precarious situation in Argentina, as the government
there attempts to restructure most of $132 billion of sovereign debt and to avoid
a threatening collapse of its financial system and/or of the currency peg to the
dollar. The appreciation of the real occurred as market participants appeared to
be optimistic that Argentina's problems will not spill over into other Latin
American economies.

IV-10
On net, the dollar appreciated 0.4 percent versus the euro, and 2.4 percent versus
sterling. The European Central Bank and Bank of England lowered their policy
rates by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points early in the period. The dollar
was also supported against the euro by weak economic data on confidence and
GDP in the euro area, and against sterling by speculation about U.K. entry into
the European Monetary Union.
Late in the intermeeting period, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy rate 50
basis points, in line with expectations. The U.S. dollar depreciated a net
1.5 percent over the period against the Canadian dollar, which rebounded from
record lows. The dollar appreciated 2.0 percent against the yen during the
intermeeting period. Comments from Japanese officials that led to speculation
about possible intervention weighed on the yen, as did reports that the Bank of
Japan may be considering purchasing foreign bonds.

Long-dated bond yields in most industrial economies increased dramatically
following the positive events in Afghanistan, but by less than in the United
States. On balance, 10-year sovereign yields in most foreign industrial countries
outside Japan rose about 30 basis points over the period. The yield on Japanese
government bonds rose 7 basis points; both Moody's and Standard and Poor's
downgraded Japan's sovereign credit rating. Yields implied by euro and sterling

IV-11
interest rate futures contracts maturing in the last three quarters of 2002 also
increased, ending 30 to 60 basis points higher on net over the period
Much of the gain in bond yields came as market participants appeared to unwind
risk-averse bond positions in favor of higher yielding stocks. On net, broad
equity indexes rose 2 to 5 percent in Europe, and about 4 and 6 percent in
Australia and Canada, respectively, while the Japanese broad index declined
0.6 percent. Technology-related stocks in Germany, Japan, and the United
Kingdom significantly outperformed broader indexes in the latter half of the
period.
Concerns over Argentina did not appear to weigh on other emerging markets, as
equity indexes increased, and dollar-denominated bond spreads over Treasuries
fell, in most emerging market economies over the intermeeting period. The
largest increases in emerging market equity prices occurred in Korea, Singapore,
and Taiwan, which were all up over 15 percent, led by gains in technology
shares. In Latin America, equity indexes in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico rose 5 to
8 percent, and sovereign bond yield spreads over Treasuries narrowed 40 to 240
basis points. Currencies of several emerging market economies appreciated
against the dollar. The Chilean peso and Brazilian real rose 5 and 6 percent,
respectively, and the Korean won rose 2.7 percent, against the dollar.
Financial market movements in Argentina reflected deepening concerns over the
government's ability to avoid default on $132 billion in public debt. Early in the
period the government announced that it would conduct an exchange of a large
portion of its sovereign debt. Even with the near-term debt service relief that the
exchange is intended to provide, the government is likely to miss the fiscal
targets that are preconditions for disbursement in December of $1.3 billion in
IMF Funds. Without the IMF disbursement, the government will be hard
pressed to make upcoming debt payments of $2 billion in December. In response
to a surge in deposit withdrawals at the end of the period, the government
imposed restrictions on the size of bank deposit withdrawals and transfers of
funds out of the country. Reflecting the effect of interest rate caps imposed by
the government, one-month interbank interest rates fell 73 percentage points
over the period, but overnight rates soared as banks sought to meet liquidity
demands. Interest rates implied by one-month non-deliverable forward contracts
also soared, reaching over 250 percent (a.r.) during the period. The yield spread

IV-12
of Argentina's sovereign debt over Treasuries rose more than 1400 1 basis points
over the period and Argentina's equity index fell over 9 percent.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
The latest GDP data confirm that activity in foreign industrial countries was
weak in the third quarter. Indicators suggest further deterioration in the current
quarter, as business confidence collapsed in September and showed little
improvement in October and November. In Japan, output likely registered
another sharp decline in the third quarter, and industry indicators weakened
further in October. Activity also declined slightly in Canada. Real GDP barely
expanded in the euro area in the third quarter, and confidence indicators fell
sharply in October and a bit more in November. Growth was better sustained in
the United Kingdom but incoming data point to a slower rate of expansion this
quarter.
Inflation continued to decline, primarily reflecting lower oil prices. The twelve-
month rate of consumer price inflation in October declined to less than 2 percent
in Canada, while retail price inflation in the United Kingdom remained below
the Bank of England's 2-1/2 percent target. The preliminary November estimate
shows that euro-area inflation retreated to just above the European Central
Bank's (ECB) 2 percent ceiling. Deflation continued in Japan.
Several central banks eased monetary policy further in November,
acknowledging the improved outlook for inflation and citing concerns about the
weaker outlook for activity. On November 8, the ECB and the Bank of England
each cut official interest rates 50 basis points, and the Bank of Canada
announced a 50 basis point cut on November 27. Banks' reserves held at the
Bank of Japan remain at elevated levels.
Indicators for Japan suggest that the economy continued to deteriorate in recent
months. Industrial production plunged nearly 3 percent in September and slid a
bit further in October. The broader all-industry index declined nearly 1 percent
in September. Machinery orders plummeted 13 percent in September and
shipments of machinery dropped slightly in October. Private consumption also
appears to be weakening, with household expenditures down about 3/4 percent
and new passenger car registrations essentially flat in the third quarter.
Residential and non-residential building starts fell for the second consecutive
month in October.
Conditions in the labor market also worsened. The unemployment rate rose to a
record 5.4 percent in October, with employment down 2 percent from its recent
peak in November of last year. The job-offers-to-applicants ratio fell to 0.55, its
lowest level since April last year. Prices have continued to decline. Core
consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include
energy) were down 1 percent in November from a year earlier. Deflation in

IV-14
wholesale prices for domestic goods has intensified as the impact of the earlier
run-up in energy prices has faded.

The merchandise trade surplus (customs clearance basis) widened a little in the
third quarter, as a 6 percent (s.a.) drop in imports, largely reflecting weakening
domestic demand, outpaced a 4 percent decline in exports. In October, the
merchandise trade surplus narrowed as imports rose 9 percent while exports
were flat.
The BOJ's official policy is to maintain the level of the outstanding balance of
banks' deposits held at the central bank "at above ¥6 trillion." Since mid
October, the balance has averaged about ¥9 trillion, but spiked to ¥14 trillion at
the end of November in response to concerns over Japanese money market funds
associated with Enron's financial difficulties.

IV-15
In mid November, the Diet passed a supplementary budget of ¥3 trillion ($25
billion) for FY2001 (April 2001-March 2002). The "real-water" content of the
package is estimated to be about ¥1 trillion (0.2 percent of GDP). Most of the
real-water spending is on structural reform measures, with relatively little on
traditional public works. The budget sets aside about ¥500 billion for labor-
market programs, such as increased public employment and extended job
training schemes. The budget also designates funds to deal with the recent
outbreak of "mad cow" disease in Japan and to implement anti-terrorism
measures. Financing the supplementary budget will bring total new debt
issuance to ¥30 trillion for FY2001, an amount Prime Minister Koizumi has
pledged not to exceed. Soon after the Diet passed the first supplementary
budget, the government announced that it would begin deliberation over a
second supplementary budget of ¥4 trillion that would be financed by proceeds
from the past sale of the government-owned telecommunications corporation.
The "real-water" content of the prospective package is expected to be about ¥2.5
trillion, although the contents of the package are still unknown. Even with the
addition of this supplementary spending, fiscal policy will be somewhat
contractionary in the latter half of this fiscal year.
In the euro area, real GDP data confirm that activity remained weak in the third
quarter, growing only 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) as consumption spending slowed and
fixed investment fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. A sizable inventory
draw-down subtracted 1.9 percentage points from growth. Net exports added
1.9 percentage points to growth, as a large decline in imports more than offset
weakness in exports. In Germany, real GDP fell 0.6 percent, following a slight
decline in the second quarter. This is the first time since 1993 that German GDP
has contracted for two consecutive quarters. Real GDP also declined in the
Netherlands. In France, however, growth picked up to a 1.9 percent rate,
supported by robust consumer spending.
Incoming indicators are consistent with a contraction in euro-area activity in the
current quarter. The volume of German industry orders plunged 4.1 percent in
September from the previous month with both domestic and foreign orders
weak. After falling sharply in October to the lowest value in its four-year
history, the purchasing managers index (PMI) for the euro-area manufacturing
sector improved slightly in November, but still signaled contraction in the
manufacturing sector for the eighth consecutive month. Service sector PMIs for
October and November are also consistent with contracting activity. Euro-area
economic sentiment sank in October and slipped a bit further in November to its
lowest level since 1997. Confidence declined in all sectors. In the industrial
survey, there has been a notable deterioration in production expectations and in
orders; levels of stocks appear to remain high. In the consumer survey, the

outlook for the general economic situation and for unemployment showed the
greatest deterioration.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole have yet to show much
deterioration, as the harmonized unemployment rate edged up to 8.4 percent in
September and remained at that rate in October. National statistics show more
pronounced increases in the French and German unemployment rates.
According to the preliminary estimate, the twelve-month rate of euro-area
consumer price inflation moved down to 2.1 percent in November, just above
the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling. Core consumer price inflation (which
excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco) edged up to 2.3 percent in October
on a twelve-month basis, but producer price inflation, which peaked at 6.6
percent for the twelve months ending in October of last year, has moved down
steadily this year.

On November 8, the ECB reduced its policy interest rates by 50 basis points,
bringing the minimum bid rate for the refinancing tender to 3.25 percent. ECB
President Duisenberg noted that the ECB's current assessment is that inflation
will fall "well below" the 2 percent limit early next year and will stay there. The
ECB has cut its policy rates 150 basis points this year.
In its autumn forecast, the European Commission noted that, with activity in the
euro area significantly weaker than anticipated earlier this year, most countries
will miss their Stability and Growth Pact targets this year and next, in some
cases by more than a percentage point of GDP. The Commission expects that
the euro area will record a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP for 2001, and the deficit
is expected to grow to 1.4 percent in 2002. The deficit in Germany is projected
to be the largest, reaching 2.7 percent of GDP in 2002, well above the deficit of

IV-18
1.2 percent of GDP expected last spring and close to the Stability and Growth
Pact limit of 3 percent.
Preparations for the changeover to euro-denominated currency notes and coins
on January 1 have moved into final stages. As of the end of October, more than
13 billion euro banknotes had been produced, enough to replace the existing
stock of national banknotes and to provide most of the additional 5 billion
banknotes for a desired "logistical contingency" stock. Delivery of currency
notes and coins to euro-area banks began in September. Most retail
establishments began to receive euro notes and coins in early December. The
general public can obtain "starter kits" of coins in mid December; euro notes
will be available from most ATMs in euro-area countries starting January 1. EU
Commission polls indicate the percentage of euro-area residents who consider
themselves "well informed" about the changeover process has risen steadily in
recent months to 68 percent in October, while those unaware of the changeover
date has fallen to 6 percent.
Real GDP growth in the United Kingdom rose slightly from 1.8 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter to 2 percent in the third quarter. Total domestic
demand grew 1.5 percent. Consumption expenditures remained robust but fixed
investment fell 11.7 percent. Inventories made a negligible contribution to
growth. Net exports subtracted 0.5 percentage point from growth, as both
imports and exports continued to contract.
Indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that growth is slowing. In November,
consumer confidence rebounded somewhat but remained lower than in
September. Retail sales fell 0.1 percent (s.a.) in October, and retail sales surveys
for November suggest that although sales growth picked up, it did not return to
its previous robust rate. Although service sector growth has been robust in
recent quarters, the latest service sector surveys are consistent with growth
slowing in the fourth quarter. In November, the outlook for expected future
production in the manufacturing sector remained very pessimistic.
Notwithstanding the recent slowing in activity, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate rose sightly to 3.2 percent in
October, while the labor force survey measure of the unemployment rate
remained at 5.1 percent for the three months centered in August. Both
unemployment rates are at near-record lows.
The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
payments) remained at 2.3 percent in October, below the Bank of England's
official target of 2.5 percent. Average earnings growth in September was at the

IV-19
4.5 percent rate (from a year earlier) that the Bank of England believes to be
compatible with its inflation target.

On November 8, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England
cut the official repo rate 50 basis points to 4 percent. The MPC has cut interest
rates 200 basis points so far this year. In its statement, the MPC cited a deeper
and longer global slowdown than previously expected and concerns about
weakness in business and consumer confidence as reasons for its easing action.

In Canada, economic activity slowed considerably going into the fourth quarter.
In the third quarter, real GDP fell 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) following an
upwardly-revised 0.6 percent gain in the second quarter. Net exports subtracted
0.3 percentage point from growth as both exports and imports declined.
Consumption spending fell for the first time since the fourth quarter of 1995. In
September, retail sales declined 1.7 percent from the previous month, as auto
sales plunged 3.3 percent and non-auto retail activity fell 1.1 percent, but auto
sales recovered in October and November with the introduction of financing
incentives. Manufacturing shipments fell 2.5 percent in September, with
particular weakness in the aerospace and petroleum sectors. While the decline in
September manufacturing activity partially reflects the impact of September
11-related disruptions in cross-border traffic, a 1.4 percent fall in new orders for
the month indicates a more prolonged weakness. Housing has exhibited a
degree of resilience not seen in other sectors of the economy, with October starts
increasing 12.7 percent (s.a.a.r.). Employment was essentially flat in October
while the unemployment rate increased slightly as a consequence of labor force
growth.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation declined considerably to 1.9
percent in October, slightly below the midpoint of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3
percent target range. The drop was primarily the product of lower energy prices,
though other prices decelerated a bit as well. On November 27, the Bank
lowered its policy rate 50 basis points to 2.25 percent, bringing the cumulative
reduction for this year to 350 basis points. The Bank stated that the cut was
meant to support the growth of domestic demand, and was consistent with
maintaining CPI inflation within the target range.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic conditions in the major developing countries remain weak; however,
signs have emerged that the worst may be over in some of the Asian economies
that have been hardest hit by a slowdown in the high-tech sector. Singapore and
Taiwan both reported sizeable increases in industrial production in October
following difficulties in September, and Malaysia and Hong Kong recorded
slightly positive GDP growth in the third quarter. In Latin America, recent data
indicate that the global economic slowdown and ongoing Argentine financial
troubles continue to hinder growth in the region. External demand remains
subdued in all of the economies, and inflationary pressures are generally limited.
The situation in Argentina has worsened further since the last Greenbook,
resulting in increased intensity of the financial turmoil in that country.
Economic activity continues to contract. Industrial production fell 1.4 percent in
October after a 3.8 percent decline in the third quarter. Construction, sales, and
confidence indicators for October are all down significantly on a twelve-month
basis. Prices in October were down 1.7 percent from a year earlier. October's
trade balance was again positive, as exports rose slightly and imports fell over
30 percent from last year. Tax revenues posted another double digit decline in
November from a year earlier and the government now projects a deficit of $7.1
billion for 2001-exceeding the IMF deficit target by $600 million. Private
analysts expect the figure to be even larger.
Falling tax revenues have led to serious cash-flow problems for the Argentine
government, which has taken several steps to address its funding needs. To
reduce outlays, the federal government has signed agreements with the provinces
to cut transfers in exchange for assistance in restructuring provincial debt. The
government also announced a controversial two-part debt exchange of almost all
of its publicly held debt to lessen debt servicing costs. The first part of the
exchange targets local investors, including Argentine banks, pensions, and
individuals and is scheduled for completion in early December. Preliminary
results, reflecting primarily domestic institutional investors, have the
government exchanging $50 billion in federal and provincial debt for new
instruments with lower interest rates and, in some cases, longer maturities. This
is anticipated to lower interest and amortization costs $6 billion in 2002. The
exchange with international investors is expected in the first quarter of 2002. To
meet immediate funding needs, the Argentine government borrowed upward of
$1 billion from the central bank in November.

These actions proved insufficient to boost confidence; by the end of November
spreads on sovereign debt were at record levels and bank depositors were
panicking. After losing several billion dollars in deposits and central bank
reserves in the last three days of November, the president issued several decrees
on December 1 designed to restrict deposit and reserve outflows. The measures
include a weekly limit on cash withdrawals from personal bank accounts, a
prohibition on lending in pesos and a restriction that peso interest rates not
exceed dollar rates, and strict controls on transfers of funds abroad (except for
operations related to international trade). Spreads on Argentine sovereign debt
have been extremely high and have risen steadily over the intermeeting period.
In Mexico, the economy continued to suffer from weak external demand and
adverse confidence effects associated with the slowdown in the United States.
Real GDP contracted about 1 percent in the third quarter, marking the fourth
consecutive quarter of falling output. Indicators from the current quarter do not
generally show any sigs of a turnaround; exports remained depressed and the
unemployment rate rose significantly in October, and business confidence
remained low in November-although it recovered somewhat from the very weak
September and October readings. The twelve-month inflation rate in October
remained comfortably below the government's year-end target of 6/2 percent.

IV-28
In mid-November, the Mexican government proposed a budget that sets a fiscal
deficit target of 0.65 percent of GDP for 2002, about the same as the deficit
currently projected for this year. The government has chosen to keep fiscal
policy tight, although with the government's assumptions about next year's oil
prices already suspect, there has been some discussion in congress of possibly
increasing the budget deficit target to one percent of GDP. Additionally, the
proposed expenditure cuts are more severe than originally planned because the
government is no longer assuming any lift to revenues through the passage of tax
reform. In this year's proposed budget, the government is also reporting a
projected public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), which estimates the
increase in public sector total net indebtedness, including net new lending by the
development banks to the private sector. The PSBR projected for 2002 is
3.2 percent of GDP, about the same as in 2001. The budget is currently under
debate in congress.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook have continued to point to
weaker economic activity. Real GDP inched up 0.2 percent in the third quarter,
as a large increase in agricultural output outweighed declines in other sectors of
the economy. The unemployment rate jumped up in October. The consumer
confidence index held steady in early November, but was down nearly

IV-29
25 percent from its peak in March. Despite the weak economy, inflation rose in
October, surpassing 7 percent on a twelve-month basis, reflecting mostly a rise
in government-controlled prices and the pass-through of earlier depreciation of
the real to domestic prices. This result is above the 6 percent ceiling of the
government's inflation target range for 2001 (on a December-over-December
basis). Weak domestic demand has contributed to an improvement in the trade
balance since the second quarter.

Data on the Venezuelan economy point to weaker growth in economic activity,
in line with falling oil prices. Third-quarter GDP rose 1.3 percent-well below
the almost 6 percent average for 2000 and the current account fell 50 percent
from the second quarter, to $3.2 billion. Output growth primarily reflected
massive public expenditure, particularly in construction. Large government
outlays combined with declining oil revenues are generating sizable fiscal
imbalances, and the deficit for next year is projected at 3 to 4 percent of GDP.
Consumer price inflation ticked up to 12.7 percent on a twelve-month basis in
November. The president recently signed laws that act to increase state control
over Venezuelan industry, including a new Hydrocarbons Law that reverses
Venezuela's seven-year trend of opening its oil sector to foreign firms. The laws
are expected to reduce domestic and international investment, and the
Venezuelan business community is organizing a work stoppage on December 10
in protest.

In Korea, real GDP increased strongly in the third quarter, boosted by a further
increase in consumption, a slower rate of inventory reduction, and a surge in
construction spending. In contrast, both exports and investment in facilities and
equipment continued to decline. However, the third-quarter growth figure
appears to overstate the underlying strength of activity, being supported by
several temporary factors. Most important, the "Full Moon" holidays fell in
October this year, rather than in September as they normally do, giving the third
quarter three more working days than normal. Even taking account of this
distortion, however, recent data on balance tend to confirm the resiliency of
activity in recent quarters in the face of the slump in export demand.
Domestic demand this year has been supported by macroeconomic stimulus.
The central bank has lowered its policy rate by a total of 125 basis points, tax
rates have been reduced, and expenditures have been increased. In early
November, the parliament approved 1.6 trillion won ($1.3 billion) of additional
spending. Combined with the 5 trillion won of supplemental budget
expenditures approved in September, this provides spending stimulus amounting
to 1-1/4 percent of GDP.

While growth in the ASEAN region has declined markedly during the recent
slowdown, data released since the last Greenbook indicate that economic activity
may have bottomed out in some of the countries. Industrial production in
Singapore surged in October, although electronics output continued to fall.
Malaysia, a high-tech producer that was hammered in the second quarter,
managed to squeak out 1 percent growth in the third quarter, in part owing to the
government's large fiscal stimulus package. The Philippines has continued to
perform reasonably well despite the global economic slowdown and surpassed
market expectations with 2.7 percent growth in the third quarter, owing mainly
to increased agriculture and service sector output. On the down side, real GDP
in the third quarter fell slightly in Indonesia, another country that had been
relatively insulated from the global slowdown up to this point.
Slow growth in the region has translated into low inflation, with each of the
countries in the region registering stable or lower year-on-year inflation in
October. For the most part, trade balances improved in the third quarter, as
imports fell more sharply than exports. With the exception of Singapore,
however, all of the countries in the region are on pace to post smaller trade
surpluses this year than last year.

In China, recent indicators suggest that growth remains relatively strong.
Industrial production moderated slightly in October, but retail sales were up
from their September level, increasing by a robust 10.5 percent from a year
earlier. The stronger than expected consumer demand pushed consumer prices
slightly higher in October. Fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises
was up just 13 percent in October over the same month last year, down from the
20 percent increases registered earlier in the year. Exports declined for the first
time since May, but imports dropped even more sharply, their second
consecutive monthly decline, and the trade surplus widened markedly.
Indicators of current and future foreign direct investment were down in October,
but they have been relatively volatile in recent months owing to divergent pull
and push factors; entry into the WTO has drawn foreign investment into China
while the global economic slowdown has reduced the supply of foreign funds.
After a recent meeting of China's top policymakers, the government announced
that it will implement stimulative measures to ensure that real GDP growth does
not fall below 7 percent next year. The government is expected to issue
180 billion yuan in bonds next year, equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP, just
slightly higher than the amount this year.

In Hong Kong, data received since the last FOMC meeting were mixed.
Following a dismal second quarter, real GDP was up 1.6 percent in the third
quarter, but other recent indicators were more negative. The unemployment rate
increased to 5.5 percent in the August-to-October period, the highest level since
early last year. The volume of retail sales was down nearly 2 percent in
September from the previous month. Exports and imports both decreased by
more than 6 percent in October. Consumer prices fell 1.2 percent over the
twelve months ended October.

Indicators released over the past month suggest that the Taiwanese economy
may have bottomed out. Despite a small increase in unemployment, industrial
production rose 8.3 percent in October, almost exactly offsetting the large
September decline. Exports and imports both increased by more than 20 percent
from September, though they still remain well below levels recorded at the same
time last year. The Council of Economic Planning and Development's index of
leading indicators rose 2.5 percent from the previous month in October. This
index has now risen for four out of the last five months, after declining in
September. Consumer prices were up in October from year earlier levels after
typhoons in Taiwan boosted food prices. Declines in other price measures,
however, underlined weakness in the economy.
