Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Economic activity has continued to expand in recent months, but at a much
more moderate pace than in the first quarter. Personal consumption
expenditures, outlays for residential construction, and government spending
have posted relatively modest gains so far this quarter after large increases early
in the year. Although outlays for nonresidential construction are still falling, the
contraction in business spending for equipment and software appears to be
ending. Meanwhile, employment is rising, but the gains, on net, have been quite
small, and the rate of unemployment is up from its level in the first quarter.
Core inflation still appears to be decelerating slightly.
Labor Market Developments
Employment reports of the past two months point to a bottoming out in the labor
market, but not much more than that yet. For April and May, private nonfarm
employment gains averaged 23,000, following thirteen months of decline. Even
so, the unemployment rate in April and May was above its first-quarter average.
By industry, manufacturing employment fell only modestly in May for the
second straight month. Moreover, employment in the help-supply industry rose
strongly for the third consecutive month, and anecdotes from help-supply firms
point to the manufacturing sector as the source of many of these new temporary
hires. Taken together, the average monthly gains in employment in help supply,
manufacturing, and wholesale trade (which is also dependent on manufacturing
activity) have averaged 23,000 thus far in the second quarter, compared with
average declines of 83,000 per month in the first quarter and 179,000 per month
in 2001.
After having fallen by 250,000 over the second half of last year, employment in
retail trade has changed little on net since December. In addition, employment
in the services industry excluding help supply has been rising, but the average
gains over the past two months are only on par with average gains in the first
quarter and below last year's average increases. Elsewhere, although
construction employment was essentially unchanged in May, it has declined by
an average of 20,000 jobs per month so far this year.
In keeping with usual practice, the May labor market report included the BLS's
comprehensive benchmark of the payroll survey to unemployment insurance
records as well as other annual updates to the payroll employment estimates.'
Although benchmark revisions to the March 2001 level of employment were
relatively small, other revisions now show that employment fell more sharply in
1. These changes include recalculation of seasonal factors, reweighting of sampled firms,
updates to bias adjustment factors, reestimation of net birth/death models, and the introduction of
a new sample design for the following industries: retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate;
and transportation and public utilities.

the spring of last year than had previously been reported and that large
employment declines continued into February of this year. Overall, the level of
employment in April 2002 was revised down 523,000 on a seasonally adjusted
basis; revisions to both employment and production worker hours suggest a
downward revision to the first-quarter level of nonfarm business employee
hours of 0.4 percent.
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm
payrolls ticked down 0.1 percent in May and have maintained a virtually flat
profile since November. After having moved up between October and February,
the workweek has held steady at 34.2 hours. However, manufacturing overtime
hours rose another 0.1 hour in May and are now one-half hour above the level at
the end of last year.
The unemployment rate in May partly reversed its increase in April, but at
5.8 percent, it was still 0.2 percentage point above its average level in the first
and fourth quarters. Job losers unemployed for fewer than five weeks as a
percentage of household employment fell in May for the seventh consecutive
month. Although still above levels prevailing in the extremely tight labor
market of the late 1990s and 2000, this proxy for the layoff rate has now fallen
to near its average in the mid-1990s following the recovery of employment from
the downturn of the early 1990s. In contrast, the number of individuals
unemployed longer than twenty-seven weeks increased more than 140,000 in
May following the typical cyclical pattern in which the average duration of
ongoing unemployment spells continues to rise well after job losses begin to
moderate; the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC)
program may also have contributed to the increase in long-term unemployment.
Both the run-up in initial claims at the end of March and the decline since then
were likely caused by the onset of the TEUC program, which required some
individuals ineligible for state unemployment insurance benefits to establish
their eligibility for federal benefits by filing state unemployment insurance
claims.2 For the week ended June 8, when the TEUC effect was likely small,
initial claims totaled 390,000, a little below the level of claims before the start
of the TEUC program. By assuring recipients of state unemployment benefits
access to federal benefits following the exhaustion of their state entitlements,
the TEUC program probably prolonged the job search of those already on state
benefit rolls as well, thereby boosting the level of insured unemployment; after
2. Using monthly data from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) on the
number of initial claimants who began receiving state benefits, we estimate that TEUC-related
claims numbered approximately 32,000 per week in late March and April. Data from the ETA
on states that report TEUC-related claims indicate that the level of these claims likely had fallen
below 5,000 per week by the end of May.

having climbed abruptly at the end of March and beginning of April, the level of
insured unemployment appears to have leveled off.
Other labor market indicators bolster the view that the labor market has touched
bottom and offer some hints of stronger hiring in coming months. The
Conference Board reported that individuals' assessments of current labor market
conditions in recent months have remained at a marginally improved level
relative to the fourth quarter of last year. Similarly, after having reached its low
point in November, the index of help wanted advertising has edged up slightly.
Households' expectations of future labor market conditions, as reported by the
Conference Board and the Michigan SRC survey, have flattened since March
but remain above levels in the first two months of the year. At the same time,
the hiring plans of firms reporting to the National Federation of Independent
Business and Manpower, Inc., are up from the first quarter.
The BLS now reports that output per hour of all persons working in the nonfarm
business sector increased at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the first quarter of
2002.3 For the four quarters ended in the first quarter of 2002, productivity rose

3. This estimate does not include the benchmark and other revisions to employment and
hours from the May employment report, which, along with the annual revisions to the NIPAs,
will be incorporated into the productivity and cost estimates released in August. Factoring in the
employment and hours revisions together with data on spending published since the most recent
GDP release, we estimate that productivity will be revised to show a 8.6 percent rise in the first
quarter.

4.2 percent, an unusually strong performance for a four-quarter period when
economic activity was weak. The BLS also reports that productivity in the
nonfinancial corporate sector rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent in the first
quarter and 5.5 percent over the four quarters ended in the first quarter of 2002.
Industrial Production
Output in the industrial sector increased 0.2 percent in May, extending the
upturn that began in January. Production of motor vehicles and electricity
generation in May declined, but output in manufacturing industries excluding
motor vehicles increased 0.3 percent, the average monthly pace for the year.
Compared with the typical postwar cyclical experience, the downturn in
industrial production (measured from its own peak to its own trough) appears to
have been a bit less than average, while the pace of recovery thus far, which is
averaging monthly gains of 0.4 percent, is considerably sub-par.4 The factory
operating rate in May, at 73.9 percent, was 1 percentage point above its recent
low in December 2001 but remains 7 percentage points beneath its 1967 to 2001
average.
Output in the high-tech sector increased 1.2 percent in May. Semiconductor
output rose 2.2 percent, a bit faster than in April but below the average rate of
increase during the first quarter. Intel and AMD (the first and second largest
producers of microprocessors, respectively) recently cautioned that demand for
microprocessors is running below expectations. Intel cited weak European
demand and AMD cited weak demand in North America and Europe.
Furthermore, Intel stated that demand appears to be shifting toward low-end
chips.5 Nonetheless, if, as our industry contacts suggest, customers' inventories
of semiconductors have been worked down to very low levels, increases in final
demand should quickly translate into increases in chip production.6 Orders for
equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers have risen nearly 70 percent
over the past four months, but they remain at a fairly subdued level.
Downstream, the production of computers rose 0.6 percent in May after an
increase of 1.5 percent in April. These gains mark a deceleration from the rapid
pace of production in the first quarter, when the output of computers for
business use, which had lagged the earlier recovery in the production of
computers for consumer use, picked up sharply. A moderation in demand may
4. The cumulative decline in total industrial production during the recent contraction was
7.1 percent, whereas the average during the nine downturns in IP since 1953 is 9.1 percent. The
average pace of increase for the first five months after the trough in IP is 0.9 percent per month.
5. The large price cuts recently announced by Intel and AMD-up to 53 percent on some
chips-are not unusual at this time of year. Intel has used this tactic in the past to clear out
inventories that will be supplanted by newer-generation processors.
6. The low level of customer inventories is corroborated by the staffs flow-of-goods
system, which also indicates a low days' supply measure for electronic components.

underlie the slowing in computer production: After having jumped nearly
5 percent in the first quarter (not at an annual rate), industry analysts expect unit
sales of personal computers to decline slightly in the second quarter.
The output of communications equipment, which decreased 1 percent in May,
continues to be restrained by weak capital spending by telecom service
providers. The output of network equipment (such as routers, switches, and
hubs) used by general business, on the other hand, has been increasing since
December. Moreover, the prospects for continued production gains in this
segment of communications equipment may be improving; when surveyed
about future spending on data networking equipment, the share of chief
information officers planning to increase spending has risen, on balance, in
recent months. Even so, prospects for the communications equipment sector
overall remain problematic.
Total production of motor vehicles ran at an annual rate of 12.1 million units in
May, putting production at the low end of the narrow range that has persisted
since the beginning of the year. However, production of medium and heavy
trucks edged up in the past two months in order to fill a rising backlog of orders
for class 8 trucks to be delivered in advance of the October switch to
environmentally friendly, but more costly, engines. Scheduled assemblies of all
vehicles in the next four months point to a significant step-up in production,

although output for all cars and trucks in the third quarter typically has fallen
short of schedules by 3-1/2 percent; with inventories of automobiles and light
trucks already at target levels, a similar shortfall looks likely to occur again this
year. Stocks of medium and heavy trucks are comfortable.
Apart from the high-tech and motor vehicle industries, increases in factory
production by major market group were widespread in May. Excluding motor
vehicles and computers, the production of durable consumer goods, which
increased 1.2 percent, has been supported by the output of home appliances; the
production of these goods has been spurred by the high levels of activity in the
homebuilding and real estate markets. The output of construction supplies,
which has been similarly buoyed by the strength in housing starts, also increased
in May. Nonetheless, recent gains in these industries have been short of those in
a typical cyclical rebound because production in these categories (in addition to
motor vehicles) was relatively well maintained during the downturn.
As a result of restrained spending by businesses, the output of business supplies
(particularly job printing) and the production of business equipment outside
motor vehicles, high-tech, and aircraft have been slow to turn around;
historically these two market groups have been among the last to show
significant increases after a trough in industrial production. In May, however,
both categories posted output gains. The output of aircraft and parts continues
to be pulled down by declines in commercial aircraft production, which has
fallen 37 percent since September 2001.      
             
            
    .
Available indicators of future industrial activity point to continued output gains,
though again along a relatively tepid track. Data for early June suggest that the
weekly physical product aggregate is likely to add about 0.3 percentage point to
the change in IP; motor vehicle assemblies and electricity generation contribute
the bulk of the increase. The staffs series on real adjusted durable goods orders
rose 4.5 percent in April, more than offsetting the declines in the previous two
months; the increases were widespread among industries. The Institute for
Supply Management's new orders diffusion index increased in May, and the
new orders index from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Business
Outlook Survey remained positive. By contrast, the level of the staff's series of
manufacturing layoff announcements through June 18 already exceeds its May
total; recent layoffs are concentrated in high-tech industries.

elsewhere. The revisions were based on updated estimates of industry capital
input, which in turn were derived from benchmark investment data from the
Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures for 2000 and staff estimates of
industry capital spending for 2001 and 2002. The 1 percent rate of increase
estimated for manufacturing during 2002 is the slowest in the history of the
series, which dates back to 1948.
Consumer Spending
The pace of consumer spending slowed appreciably, on balance, this spring
from the rapid rate posted in the first quarter. Consumer spending on motor
vehicles and other goods fell back in May, offsetting the advance the month
before.
After having shot up to 17.2 million units in April, sales of light motor vehicles
dropped to an annual rate of 15.5 million units in May.7 Average sales for the
two months about matched the first-quarter level. Confidential data from the
Big Three indicate that fleet sales were flat in May; thus, last month's decrease
in sales occurred entirely on the retail side. The decline was widespread; no
automaker reported an increase in sales on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Automakers appear to be interpreting the May dip in sales as an aberration, and
our contacts in the industry currently expect sales to move back up in June.
Indeed, a payback from the sharp increase in April seems to be the only obvious
explanation for the May slide in sales. Available data from J.D. Power indicate
that rebates and interest rate subsidies continued at near record levels through
the beginning of June. More recently, General Motors boosted incentives on
certain auto and truck models, and the firm now estimates that the pricing
environment will be even more competitive than it had expected earlier in the
quarter. Consumers remain fairly upbeat about car-buying conditions; although
the index of car-buying conditions in the Michigan SRC survey ticked down in
early June, it has remained at a generally favorable level.
In May, nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which excludes
automotive dealers and building materials and supply stores, fell 0.4 percent
following an upward-revised gain in April of 1 percent. Spending was off
sharply at clothing stores and gasoline stations, but the decline at the latter was
probably due mostly to falling gasoline prices last month. Sales by general
merchandisers also fell back in May. Nevertheless, merchants of furniture and
appliances posted advances in May, and sales by nonstore retailers, namely
electronic and mail-order houses, rose smartly for the second consecutive
month. Factoring in price changes, we estimate that sales of goods other than
7. Sales of light vehicles since September have been revised a little because of a correction
by DaimlerChrysler to the mix of light and medium trucks sold.

motor vehicles were about unchanged in real terms in May following an
increase of 0.1 percent in April.
Real outlays on services were unchanged in April, the most recent month for
which data are available. Spending on energy services and on brokerage and
investment counseling is estimated to have dropped back, but these declines
were offset by increases in other services outlays, such as medical care.
Meanwhile, the increase in stock market volumes points to a rebound in
spending on brokerage services in May.
Despite fairly modest gains in the past few months, real consumer spending rose
3-1/4 percent over the twelve months ending in April: The increase in spending
was supported by a 4-1/2 percent rise in real disposable income over the same
period, which was buoyed by a decline in personal tax payments and an increase
in transfer payments. The fallback in personal tax payments reflects both last
year's tax legislation and the combination of extraordinarily weak final
payments (relative to the BEA's estimate of personal income) and large income
tax refunds this tax season. The increase in transfer payments was boosted by a
cyclical expansion in social programs. More recently, the labor market report
suggested only a modest rise in private wages and salaries last month.
With the increase in income outpacing gains in consumer spending over the
twelve months ending in April, the level of the saving rate was nearly
1-1/2 percentage points above a year ago. Reductions in wealth during the past
two years have put substantial downward pressure on spending, and the declines
in the stock market so far this spring likely pushed the ratio of net worth to
disposable personal income down further.
Consumer confidence, as measured by either the Michigan SRC index or the
Conference Board index, continued to increase through May, but the
preliminary, early-June reading of the Michigan survey dipped back to the low
end of the range seen so far this year. Taking a longer perspective, consumer
confidence measures stand close to their averages over the past decade, at levels
consistent with moderate increases in overall consumer spending.
Housing Markets
After having dipped in April, starts of single-family homes jumped 9.6 percent
in May to an unexpectedly brisk annual rate of 1.39 million units. The May
volume of starts slightly exceeded the average pace in the first quarter, which
was the highest quarterly figure in twenty-three years. However, permits for
single-family construction-adjusted to include construction in areas where
permits are not required-were little changed at 1.29 million units, putting the
ratio of starts to adjusted permits two standard deviations above the average.
Because single-family starts typically adjust toward a better alignment with

permits, the starts estimate for May appears unsustainably robust. Nevertheless,
starts are expected to remain quite strong in coming months.
Most indicators of financial conditions continue to support strong housing
demand. The contract rate on thirty-year fixed-rate conventional mortgages
edged down in mid-June to 6-3/4 percent, the lowest level since last November,
and initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages slid to 4-3/4 percent. The share of
mortgage originations financed with ARMs increased to 19 percent in April
(most recent data), the highest percentage since fall 2000. And as of mid-June,
the Mortgage Bankers Association index of mortgage applications for home
purchase was near a record high. In contrast, homebuying attitudes, as
measured by the preliminary Michigan survey, fell substantially in early June.8
Sales of new homes increased 1 percent in April to an annual rate of
915,000 units. The pace of sales in both March and April closely matched the
total for last year, which was the highest on record. The inventory of new
homes for sale rose in April to 316,000 units, but the months' supply of homes
for sale was unchanged at 4-1/4 months-a low ratio that provides no hint that
production has been excessive. Sales of existing homes jumped 7 percent in
April, to an annual rate of nearly 5.8 million units. The increase partly offset a
drop in March, bringing these sales to their third highest level on record.
Median prices of new homes and existing homes increased in March and April
at twelve-month rates of 6 percent to 7 percent-somewhat less rapidly than in
earlier months, although still a brisk pace. The constant-quality price index for
new homes, which adjusts for changes in geographic composition and in home
size and other amenities, rose 5-1/4 percent in the first quarter from twelve
months earlier, the largest increase since the fourth quarter of 2000. The
repeat-sales price index for existing homes decelerated to 6-1/4 percent,
year-over-year, in the first quarter. Although this was the slowest rise since late
1999, it still was noticeably elevated compared with price increases for existing
homes during the 1990s.
Multifamily housing starts continued their recently erratic monthly pattern; they
rose 20 percent in May to an annual rate of 344,000 units, partly offsetting a
drop in April. However, the pace of multifamily starts so far in the second
quarter is 11 percent below the average for the first quarter. Recent readings on
market conditions for rental apartments have been downbeat. In the first
quarter, the vacancy rate for apartments jumped to the highest level since the
8. The rise in negative homebuying opinions reflected increased concern in early June about
high home prices and about current and expected economic conditions. Surprisingly, the
decrease in positive homebuying opinions mainly reflected a drop in the proportion of
respondents that mentioned low interest rates, even though rates for fixed-rate mortgages and
adjustable-rate mortgages have declined, on balance, since March.

late 1980s; rents decreased relative to four quarters earlier, as measured by the
National Real Estate Index; and property values declined from a year earlier.
Demand for rental apartments has softened, owing partly to cyclical declines in
employment; in addition, home ownership has become more affordable,
reflecting both low mortgage rates and reduced down-payments.
By contrast, conditions in the market for condominiums and cooperative
apartments-together referred to here as "condos"-appear robust. Sales of
existing condos jumped nearly 16-1/2 percent in the first quarter, to a record
annual rate of 838,000 units.9 The demand for condos has been stimulated by
many of the same conditions that have contributed to the strong demand for
single-family homes, including low mortgage rates, population growth, and
substantial house-price appreciation. Moderately priced condos provide a
relatively affordable entry into home ownership, particularly in areas with high
house prices. Even though the median price of existing condos jumped
15-1/4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, almost twice as fast as the
rise in the median price of existing single-family homes, the median condo price
was still 11 percent below the median price of existing homes.10
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. Real outlays on equipment and software declined at
an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first quarter after having fallen at about a
5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.11 Real spending for computer equipment
rose 30 percent, but because of small declines in outlays for software and
communications equipment, overall spending on high-tech equipment eked out
only a small gain. Business spending on both motor vehicles and aircraft
9. Data are available for condominium and cooperative sales beginning in 1981.
10. Note that some of the more rapid rise in prices for existing condos likely reflects their
considerably greater concentration, compared with existing single-family homes, in urban areas,
where zoning and other controls on land use limit the supply of land available for construction.
11. Historical data on orders and shipments of capital goods have been revised for the
period January 1992 through April 2002. The revisions mainly reflect the benchmarking to the
2000 Annual Survey of Manufactures. The revisions after 2000 incorporate late filers and
updated seasonal adjustment factors. Census has not yet released all of the detailed data that we
use in the equipment and software forecast.
A preliminary reading of the data we have in hand indicates that there were large downward
revisions in orders and shipments for some categories in 2000, notably computers and peripheral
equipment. Revisions to growth rates since then appear small.
Our contacts at the BEA indicated that they plan to incorporate the revisions in the final
GDP release for the first quarter and in the advance GDP release for the second quarter. At the
time of the annual revision, the BEA intends to incorporate the revisions to earlier quarters.

decreased sharply. Excluding the high-tech and transportation categories,
spending increased moderately.
For the current quarter, the incoming shipments data point to a small upturn in
equipment spending, and the orders data through April (latest available) hint at
further recovery in business spending in the second half of the year. While
shipments outside the high-tech categories were about unchanged in April,
shipments of high-tech equipment posted their first gain since the start of the
year. At the same time, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding
aircraft jumped 4 percent in April after having posted a small decrease in the
first quarter. In the high-tech categories, orders for computers were about
unchanged, and orders for communications equipment increased about
12 percent, to a level above that of shipments. Outside the high-tech categories
(excluding aircraft), new bookings rose 3.8 percent, on the strength of increases
in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, and engines and turbines.
In the transportation equipment sector, recent developments have been mixed.
Production data from Boeing and the most recent data on shipments and
international trade suggest that business spending on aircraft is likely to be down
in the second quarter. In contrast, business demand for motor vehicles has
firmed. Fleet sales of light motor vehicles averaged 3-1/4 million units in April
and May, 390,000 units above the level in the first quarter and just a little less
than the average in the first half of 2001, before demand plunged in the wake of
September 11. Sales of medium and heavy trucks edged up again in May, and
orders for class 8 trucks have remained at a relatively high level before the
October switch to lower-emissions engines.
Nonresidential construction. Real expenditures on nonresidential construction
contracted further in the first quarter.12 Outlays for office and industrial
structures, lodging facilities, and public utilities declined substantially, and
expenditures for drilling and mining continued to move lower. The overall
decline of $15.4 billion in real terms resulted in the second largest percentage
decrease recorded for this sector since the third quarter of 1991.13
12. After taking into account the revisions included in the April construction put-in-place
release, we estimate that real spending on nonresidential construction declined at an annual rate
of 22-1/2 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 23-3/4 percent decrease included in the
BEA's preliminary estimate of real GDP.
13. The huge $26.9 billion decline in the fourth quarter-the largest since 1991-was
artificially magnified by the long-term lease in July 2001 of the World Trade Center by two
private companies. The BEA treated this transaction as a purchase of property by private
nonresidential business, which boosted investment in the third quarter. Excluding this special
factor, private construction spending would have declined $16.2 billion in the fourth quarter.

In April, real outlays for the buildings component of nonresidential structures
turned up slightly.14 But the level still is 1-1/4 percent below the average for the
first quarter, and it is down 18 percent from April of last year. Institutional
construction, which comprises educational, religious, and hospital structures, is
the only category of nonresidential buildings for which expenditures have risen
from twelve months ago.
The vacancy rate for office buildings in downtown areas and in suburban
locations rose in the first quarter to 11.7 percent and 15.6 percent respectively;
although these rates are noticeably above the lows at the end of 2000, they are
still well below the peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Partly reflecting the
drag from subleasing of unneeded space, office rents in the first quarter fell
almost 9 percent from their year-earlier level, and the value of office property
was down 6 percent. Real spending for construction of office buildings fell at
an annual rate of 36 percent in the first quarter following a 22-1/2 percent
decline in the preceding quarter.
Spending for other commercial structures (including retail space and
warehouses) is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 18-1/2 percent in the
first quarter, marking the first increase in a year.15 The ongoing declines in
retail property values and rents appear to have moderated a bit in the first
quarter; property values and rents for warehouse space decreased slightly more
rapidly.
Real outlays for industrial buildings declined at an annual rate of 52 percent in
the first quarter after having dropped at a 70 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The vacancy rate for industrial buildings jumped to 10.8 percent in the first
quarter, which is the highest level on record, dating back to late 1982.
The rate of decline in outlays for lodging and other miscellaneous facilities
doubled to an annual rate of 33 percent in the first quarter. Expenditures for
drilling and mining fell at a 44 percent rate, reflecting sharp declines last year in
the prices of petroleum and natural gas. Drilling activity for petroleum and
natural gas typically responds to changes in oil and gas prices with a lag, and
despite the upturn in energy prices this year, the number of oil drilling rigs in
operation has been about flat. The number of gas drilling rigs in operation
declined through early April but rose between then and early June.
Construction outlays by public utilities turned down again in the first quarter
and now stand 19-1/2 percent below the level of a year ago.
14. The buildings component includes construction of office, industrial, retail, warehouse,
lodging, and institutional facilities and excludes mining, drilling activity, and utility construction.
15. The preliminary GDP estimate indicated an increase of 5.9 percent, but the April report
on construction put-in-place included fairly substantial upward revisions to the estimates for
February and March.

Business Inventories
The slowdown in the pace of liquidation appears to be continuing: The book
value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles fell at an
annual rate of $30 billion in April, the latest month for which data are available,
following a $48 billion reduction in the first quarter. Virtually all the slowing in
inventory liquidation in April occurred in the manufacturing sector. Stocks held
by manufacturers of durable goods declined in almost every category. In most
durable goods categories, inventory-shipments ratios decreased, and in a few
categories, inventory-shipments ratios were nearing, or at, record lows. For
most types of nondurable goods, inventory-shipments ratios also trended down,
although they remain somewhat elevated at manufacturers of chemicals and of
beverage and tobacco products. Wholesalers liquidated inventories at a
somewhat faster pace in April than in the first quarter, while the small decline in
stocks at retailers was about the same in April as during the first quarter. In
general, wholesale and retail inventory-sales ratios do not appear elevated
relative to trend in any of the major subcategories.
Data from the staffs flow-of-goods system identify only a few products for
which days' supply ratios remain elevated-paper products, communications
equipment, and electrical machinery excluding high-tech equipment.16 Days'
supply ratios are no longer excessive for any of the remaining categories,
including those such as furniture and fixtures, printing and publishing, primary
metals, and miscellaneous manufactures, that were listed as elevated in the May
Greenbook. By market group, excessive stocks of consumer goods and
intermediate products (particularly construction supplies) appear to have been
eliminated. Although the days' supply ratio for materials remains slightly
above levels reached before the downturn in industrial production, it has
declined sharply during the past few months. In contrast, the ratio for business
equipment is substantially below its peak in mid-2001, but it has come back up
from its lows earlier this year.
16. The FRB staffs flow-of-goods system measures changes in inventories by tracking the
flow of goods in the economy. The system divides the output from the staff's industrial
production indexes into more than 70 product categories. For each product category, the system
estimates the supply of goods flowing into the economy-that is, domestic production plus
imports. The system then estimates how much of the supply flows out, whether as final demand,
including exports, or as inputs for other goods. The difference between the amount flowing in
and the amount flowing out represents that change in inventories. We find inventory
accumulation if inflows exceed outflows and inventory liquidation if outflows exceed inflows.

Government Sector
Federal. The federal government recorded a $67 billion surplus in April, far
below the $190 billion surplus recorded last year. Most of this deterioration
owes to a sharp falloff in receipts. Nonwithheld individual income and self-
employment taxes, which are mostly final payments on 2001 tax liability, were
$66 billion lower this April than last. According to Daily Treasury Statements,
the decline continued into May, leaving nonwithheld payments for the filing
season as a whole about 35 percent lower than last year. In addition, individual
income tax refunds were up about 20 percent for the filing season as a whole.
Corporate receipts have also been well below last year's levels, likely because
of weak corporate profits and the business tax provisions enacted in March. In
April, corporate receipts were about 60 percent lower than a year earlier, in

large part because of a surge in refunds. Treasury data indicate that corporate
estimated tax payments, which were due June 17, were just slightly below last
year's level.
After adjustment for routine payment timing shifts, outlays in April were up
12 percent from a year earlier, as robust increases in most spending categories
were only partially offset by a decline in net interest payments. Defense
spending continued to be strong, up almost 14 percent over last April. Spending
on income security in April was substantially above last year's level, reflecting
higher unemployment insurance payments and a jump in outlays for child tax
credits (which are claimed on year-end tax returns and are deemed outlays to the
extent that they bring a taxpayer's liability below zero).
The Senate and the House have passed slightly different versions of a
supplemental appropriations bill that boosts spending about $10 billion in both
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003. About half of the additional spending is for
defense, and most of the rest is for homeland security.
State and local governments. Indicators of state and local spending have been
relatively weak so far in the second quarter. Employment gains averaged 4,500
per month in April and May, down from 26,000 per month, on average, during
the first quarter. In response to recent budgetary difficulties, some states have
taken steps to restrain employee-related spending, primarily through hiring
freezes, furloughs, and travel restrictions; a number of states have also instituted
layoffs. These actions have mainly affected state employees other than those
working for educational institutions. Local education employment (largely
public elementary and secondary schools) has held up rather well.17 Meanwhile,
construction spending edged down in April from an exceptionally high level in
the first quarter.
According to a May report by the National Association of State Budget Officers,
in the absence of budget remedies, aggregate state budget gaps-the extent to
which general fund expenditures would have surpassed general fund
receipts-would have reached $40 billion during fiscal 2002, which ends
June 30 for most states. To prevent these gaps, governments cut spending
$15 billion and instituted almost $12 billion in fund transfers, drawing down
both general fund balances and budget-stabilization (rainy-day) funds. The
remaining shortfall was to be covered through a variety of other measures,
including increases in taxes and fees. States also appear to be working hard to
deal with budget difficulties now projected for fiscal 2003. In addition to
17. Much of K-12 spending cannot be cut during a current budget year because of contracts
with teachers and others. Moreover, because K-12 education is a high priority for most state
governments, the potential for sizable future cuts may be limited as well.

another round of spending cuts and fund transfers, significantly more tax and fee
hikes have been proposed. While only eleven states raised taxes, tuition, and
other fees in 2002, the count is now up to around thirty states that are planning
these kinds of revenue actions for fiscal 2003.
Prices and Labor Costs
The March and April increases in energy prices briefly pushed up overall
inflation, but a drop in energy prices in May left the CPI unchanged last month.
All told, the CPI has increased at an annual rate of 3 percent so far this year.
Excluding food and energy, consumer prices still appear to be decelerating
slightly. The core CPI rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first five
months of this year, compared with 2.7 percent over the whole of 2001;
incorporating our estimate for May, core PCE price inflation has edged down
from a 1.6 percent increase in 2001 to a 1.5 percent rise (annual rate) over the
first five months of this year.
Consumer energy prices rose sharply in March and April, reflecting a rise in
crude oil prices and a widening of retail gasoline markups. However, these
markups fell back in May. More recently, spot prices of crude oil have eased a
bit, and survey data suggest that gasoline prices have been falling so far in June.
Inventories of natural gas remain plentiful, and spot prices of natural gas have
fallen about 15 percent over the past month. However, futures quotes on natural
gas prices through the December 2002 contract imply a larger-than-average
seasonal increase in prices this fall and early winter.
Over the past couple of months, supplies of many fresh vegetables have
increased and prices have fallen steeply, holding down the rise in retail food
prices. In addition, consumer prices for meats and poultry, which began to
weaken late last year, have remained subdued this spring. All told, retail prices
for food have risen about 2 percent over the past twelve months.
Consumer prices other than for food and energy appear to have slowed a bit in
recent months. Tobacco prices surged in April, but this increase was partially
retraced in May. Outside of tobacco, the core CPI increased only 0.2 percent
per month in April and May. Core PCE prices excluding tobacco have
increased more slowly-about 0.1 percent in each of the past two months.
Consumer prices of non-energy goods, which declined about 0.2 percent in
May, continue to be very soft. In contrast, inflation in non-energy services
picked up last month, as an acceleration in airfares and the price of medical
services more than offset a relatively small increase in the cost of shelter, which
increased at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent during the first four months of the
year. Between May 2001 and May 2002, core services prices rose 3.9 percent,
0.3 percentage point more rapidly than in the previous twelve months.

Broader measures of price inflation have slowed in recent quarters. The chain-
weighted price index for GDP increased 1.3 percent in the four quarters ending
in the first quarter, compared with 2.3 percent the previous year. Much of this
slowdown owed to falling energy prices, but a deceleration in business software
prices also contributed, as did the slowdown in core PCE inflation since the
beginning of the year.
While inflation appears to have come down over the past year, survey measures
of inflation expectations have not. The preliminary Michigan survey for June
showed median one-year-ahead inflation expectations at 3 percent, a little higher
than the levels recorded last year prior to September. However, longer-term
inflation expectations have remained more stable; the median five- to ten-year-
ahead inflation expectation was 2.9 percent in early June, virtually the same as
the 3 percent figure reported last summer.
At earlier stages of processing, prices have firmed in recent months. Although
the PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy was unchanged in
May, it has risen 1/2 percent (not at an annual rate) over the past three months.
The PPI for crude materials excluding food and energy rose sharply in May,
following a large April increase. Both increases were due in part to a surge in
prices of steel scrap, but more broadly, prices at the earlier stages of processing
are likely responding to the upturn in industrial activity.18 The latest increases in
core crude materials prices have pushed up that index 6.5 percent since
February, a sharp contrast with the 6.9 percent decline in the preceding twelve
months. Since the May PPI pricing date, commodity prices appear to have
picked up further; in particular, the Journal of Commerce index has risen
4.7 percent since May 14.
We have received very little new information regarding labor costs.
Compensation per hour (CPH) in the nonfarm business sector increased at an
annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, down from the nearly
4 percent rise during 2001. Average hourly earnings (AHE) of production or
nonsupervisory workers, the main indicator used to construct CPH, shows a
similar pattern. Recent benchmark revisions to this AHE series put its rise over
the course of 2001 at 4 percent, but AHE rose much more slowly between
December 2001 and May of this year-only 2.3 percent at an annual rate.
18. The price of steel was boosted partly by trade restraints and partly by an increase in
demand.

Domestic Financial Developments
Over the intermeeting period, the news about the economy was somewhat less
upbeat, on balance, than investors had expected. In addition, further reports of
deficiencies in corporate governance and transparency intensified doubts about
the quality of some firms' balance sheets, and tensions flared in a few key
trouble spots around the world. These developments, in concert, prompted a
retrenchment in risk-taking.
Broad equity price indexes posted moderate decreases, leaving some below
levels prevailing just before the terrorist attacks last fall, and risk spreads on
speculative-grade bonds widened significantly. The somewhat weaker tone of
economic data and investor demand for safe assets, along with the declines in
equity prices, pushed down yields on longer-dated Treasury securities and
investment-grade corporate bonds. Corporate borrowers have been trying to
pare their risks as well, by curbing overall borrowing and continuing to pay
down commercial paper to minimize rollover risk. In contrast, the household
sector apparently continued to borrow at a brisk pace, especially against home
equity.
Against the backdrop of weak tax receipts and increased outlays, federal debt
expanded over the second quarter to levels that have bumped up against the
federal debt ceiling. The Treasury has resorted to emergency measures to avoid
breaching the ceiling, but current estimates suggest that the debt ceiling will
need to be raised by late this month.
Policy Expectations, Stock Prices, and Interest Rates
Market participants had largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its May
meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged and to maintain a
balanced assessment of risks. However, investors interpreted the accompanying
statement as suggesting that the FOMC was in no hurry to tighten policy absent
clear signs of a sustained economic expansion, and eurodollar futures rates
dropped a few basis points that afternoon. Futures rates dropped further over
the intermeeting period, and policy uncertainty implied by options prices edged
up, on net, from already elevated levels.
Both current futures quotes and market surveys suggest that investors have
essentially ruled out a hike in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming
FOMC meeting. In addition, investors now view an increase in the target rate at
the August meeting as very unlikely and place less than even odds on a policy
tightening by the September meeting. Recent surveys suggest that most market
participants expect the FOMC to retain a statement of balanced risks through the
September meeting.

III-3
Yields on Treasury coupon securities were somewhat volatile during the
intermeeting period. In the weeks immediately after the May 7 FOMC meeting,
generally stronger-than-expected data releases and firming equity prices pushed
up yields across the maturity spectrum. However, Treasury yields declined in
subsequent weeks as incoming data painted a somewhat less upbeat picture of
the economy, equity prices sagged, and global tensions rose. On balance over
the period, Treasury coupon yields out to ten years declined about 25 basis
points. Yields on Treasury indexed debt were about unchanged, which,
combined with the decrease in nominal Treasury yields, implied a drop in
inflation compensation.
Favorable first-quarter earnings reports from major retailers and a few high-tech
manufacturers bolstered equity prices early in the intermeeting period.
However, the gains were more than offset over the next several weeks on
several new revelations of shoddy corporate governance and various
disappointing sales forecasts from bellwether technology and telecom firms. On
balance, most major stock indexes fell between 1 and 2-1/2 percent, and stock
market volatility climbed substantially. The decline in stock prices boosted the
ratio of expected year-ahead earnings to price for the S&P500 to nearly
5-1/2 percent. The gap between this earnings-price ratio and the real ten-year
Treasury yield, a crude measure of the required equity return premium, rose to
levels more in line with those before 1997.
While spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds edged a bit lower over the
intermeeting period, spreads on high-yield bonds widened considerably across
many sectors. Consistent with some pullback from risk-taking on the part of
investors, inflows to equity and junk bond mutual funds have slowed to a trickle
in recent weeks, with flows being redirected toward government and
investment-grade corporate bond funds.
Business Finance
With gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms falling off markedly in May and
bond retirements picking up, net bond issuance cooled substantially.
Investment-grade issuance fell, even as yields eased over the month, and these
offerings remained fairly light in the first half of June. Issuance of below-
investment-grade bonds in May and the first half of June was only a bit below
its average pace of the past several months, but investors continued to strongly
favor firms at the upper end of the speculative-grade spectrum.
Interest rates and risk spreads were little changed in the commercial paper
market. However, outstanding commercial paper of nonfinancial corporations
posted its fifth straight monthly decline in May and contracted further in early
June. Thus far this year, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding has shrunk
about 25 percent, after dropping by a third last year. The most recent declines
appear to have been fairly broad-based and can probably be attributed, in part, to

increased pressure by bond rating agencies for firms to reduce rollover risk. The
decline in C&I loans at commercial banks has appeared to flatten out of late, but
total net debt financing remained sluggish.
In contrast, seasoned equity offerings continued at the relatively strong pace that
has prevailed since October, boosted in part by some firms' raising equity to
deleverage and improve access to credit markets. Seasoned offerings averaged
over $5-1/2 billion per month in April and May, and a large issue by AT&T in
early June helped push issuance to almost that amount by midmonth. Initial
public offerings rose somewhat in May from the anemic pace earlier this year,
and the flow of new filings suggests that IPOs could pick up a bit further in June
and July.
At the same time, merger activity has remained nearly moribund, and equity
repurchases have been light. So far in the second quarter, announcements of
cash-financed merger deals are on track to total only $18 billion, about a third of
the quarterly pace in 2000. Announcements of new equity repurchase programs
look to about match the $10 billion posted in the first quarter, the lowest
quarterly pace since 1994, as firms continued to conserve their cash balances.
Corporate credit quality continued to be weak. Moody's downgrades remained
large during April and May, reflecting revelations of aggressive accounting and
further weakness in the telecommunications sector. Bond defaults also stayed
high in April and May, leaving the three-month moving average at more than
2-1/2 percent, roughly in line with last year's average pace. The delinquency
rate on business loans at commercial banks edged up again in the first quarter of
2002, bringing the cumulative rise since the end of 1998 to nearly 2 percentage
points. The charge-off rate on these loans declined a bit relative to last year's
final quarter but remained quite high. A forward-looking measure of aggregate
credit quality based on KMV's year-ahead firm-level expected default
frequencies has continued to hover at the high end of its range over the past
decade.
Corporate earnings have shown signs of improvement. Although first-quarter
earnings came in 8 percent below year-earlier levels for the S&P500 as a whole,
those results were more than 10 percent higher than fourth-quarter earnings (at a
seasonally adjusted quarterly rate). The preliminary estimate of first-quarter
NIPA profits, a broader gauge of U.S. corporate sector performance, came in
5 percent above year-earlier results. Overall, corporate guidance regarding
prospective second-quarter results has been reasonably balanced between
positive and negative pre-announcements; however, the early warnings from
technology and telecom companies continue to be less encouraging than those
from other sectors. Equity analysts currently expect second-quarter S&P500
earnings per share to top year-earlier results by roughly 6 percent, the first such
gain since the third quarter of 2000.

Commercial Real Estate Finance
Growth in commercial mortgage debt slowed sharply in the first quarter, to an
annual rate of 5 percent, and is expected to edge down further in the second
quarter. Issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), a key
source of commercial real estate financing over the past several years, remained
weak in April and May but was a bit more active than in the first quarter.
Despite the currently weak fundamentals in commercial property markets,
CMBS risk spreads have remained relatively stable, and delinquency rates on
CMBS and commercial real estate loans at commercial banks have leveled off
recently.
Two rating agencies (Moody's and Fitch) recently placed certain CMBS on
watch for possible downgrade because of insufficient terrorism insurance.
However, the affected securities are backed by high-profile properties and
represent only a small share of total CMBS outstanding. Although the effects of
difficulties in the market for terrorism insurance apparently have been limited,
Congress continues to consider providing coverage against large terrorism
losses for insurers. The Senate put aside a House bill passed last winter that
would provide long-term loans to insurers after they had paid $1 billion in
claims as a result of terrorist attack and passed a bill that would provide
substantial direct federal assistance to insurers based on the overall cost of the
attack and the insurers' market shares.
Household Finance
The limited data now in hand for the second quarter suggest that household
borrowing has continued at a brisk pace. Consumer debt grew 6-1/4 percent in
April, a pickup from the first quarter but below the auto-related spurt in the
fourth quarter of last year. Long-term mortgage rates have remained relatively
low, supporting new purchases of homes and mortgage refinancing activity.
Judging from preliminary data on MBS issuance in April and May, and from
data on mortgage lending at banks, mortgage debt growth continues to be quite
strong.
The household debt-service burden is expected to edge up in the second quarter,
after a first-quarter decrease that mainly reflected a boost to disposable personal
income when additional provisions of last year's federal tax cut took effect.
Household credit quality, however, has remained reasonably strong, on balance,
though there are some pockets of stress. Most measures of delinquency rates on
standard consumer and mortgage debt were little changed early this year (latest
data available), but delinquencies on pools of nonprime automobile loans rose
sharply in March from an already high level and the delinquency rate on
subprime mortgages remained very elevated in the first quarter. On the asset
side, the decline in equity values has pulled the ratio of household assets to
disposable income lower in the second quarter.

Government and Agency Finance
The Secretary of the Treasury declared a debt ceiling emergency on May 16 and
identified about $80 billion worth of accounting devices that could be employed
to create financing room within the existing $5.95 trillion debt limit. Since then,
the Treasury has been using one of these devices-disinvesting securities from
government funds (as it had in April).' After factoring in corporate and
individual non-withheld tax payments through mid-June, current projections
indicate that further disinvestments from the trust funds will allow the Treasury
to operate until late June. On June 28, however, it appears very likely that either
an increase in the debt ceiling or additional accounting measures beyond the
ones that the Treasury has already identified will be required in order for it to
meet its interest payments to the trust funds
The Secretary's announcement and subsequent actions generally have had little
effect on Treasury yields, as market participants still seem confident that the
debt ceiling will be raised in time to avoid a default. The Treasury substantially
reduced the size of its weekly four-week bill offering on June 18 and issued a
press release stating that it was postponing its announcement for the June
two-year note auction until ".. .Treasury is assured that it has sufficient
borrowing authority." The Treasury could still conduct the auction on the
regular schedule (June 26) with an abbreviated advance notice period if the debt
ceiling is raised. However, at this point, the status of the debt ceiling legislation
in Congress is uncertain. On June 11, the Senate passed a standalone bill to
increase the debt ceiling, but House Republican leadership would still prefer to
attach the measure to another bill. Congressional sources predict that the ceiling
will be increased on June 27, the day before the ceiling becomes unavoidably
binding and Congress begins its July 4 holiday recess.
Gross offerings of long-term debt by state and local governments jumped in
May from the already strong April pace. Both new capital and refunding
issuance were robust, boosted in part by the decline in municipal bond yields
over the past few weeks in May. Refundings were also lifted by the first tranche
($3 billion) of a $14 billion program by the New York Metro Transit Authority,
with special permission from Congress to advance-refund for a second time its
municipal bonds, to help defray costs of reconstruction. So far this year,
municipal credit quality has held about steady, on balance, with upgrades no
longer outnumbering downgrades.
1. The Treasury has the authority to disinvest from some government trust funds to meet
emergency funding needs. In effect, the disinvestment involves substituting Treasury "IOUs" for
Treasury securities that are held as assets by the trust funds. Such IOUs are not counted as part
of the debt subject to the ceiling, and hence the operation opens up some leeway for the Treasury
to increase debt that is subject to the ceiling.

III-15
Net borrowing by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has moderated significantly in
recent months, in concert with slower growth in their mortgage portfolios.
Market participants attribute the slower expansion of their balance sheets to the
reduced profitability of MBS investments relative to agency funding costs.
Farmer Mac (the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation) has come under
increased market scrutiny since late April, when an article in a major newspaper
raised questions about the overall soundness of the institution and pointed out
that a large share of its assets were not related to agricultural mortgages.2 Since
then, Farmer Mac's stock price has declined by about a fourth and credit default
swap spreads for the institution's debt have soared from about 40 basis points to
184 basis points. However, market participants report that the difficulties
encountered by Farmer Mac do not seem to have affected the funding costs for
other agencies.
Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit
Money growth picked up in May, largely because of tax-related effects.
Households typically build up M2 balances in April in anticipation of making
tax payments; the balances then fall off in May as tax payments clear. This
year, non-withheld tax collections were well below the normal seasonal patterns,
and as a result, seasonally adjusted M2 was weak in April and strong in May.
However, even abstracting from the effects of tax-related flows, money growth
appears to have accelerated somewhat in May relative to recent months. As
stock prices fell during the latter part of the month, households may have
favored the safety of M2 assets over stock market investments, as indicated by
the near cessation of net inflows to equity mutual funds.
Bank credit grew briskly in May, but the strength was caused almost entirely by
a large thrift institution's conversion to a bank charter, which mainly boosted
real estate loans and securities holdings. Excluding the effects of that
conversion, bank credit growth fell back last month, and total loan growth
remained anemic. One exception was revolving home equity loans, which
continued to advance at a rapid clip, likely fueled in part by the combination of
relatively low interest rates and recent strong gains in home values.
Data from the May Survey of Terms of Business Lending showed a narrowing
of the spread charged on new loans compared with the February survey.
Spreads on loans not made under previous commitment, however, rose. More

broadly, the distribution of loan spreads has shifted down, but it widened in the
first half of 2002 relative to last year. This move suggests that lenders remain
concerned about lower-quality borrowers, consistent with the selectivity evident
in the bond and syndicated loan markets.

The value of exported goods and services rose 0.6 percent in March, with small
increases in both the goods and services categories. For goods, a decline in
agricultural exports was offset mainly by gains in aircraft and automotive
products. The increase in service exports was in travel and passenger fares,
more than offsetting a drop in other private services related to funding provided
in February by the International Olympic Committee for the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games. For the first quarter as a whole, total exports were up 3.6
percent at an annual rate, the first increase since the third quarter of 2000. BEA
estimates that total real exports of goods and services were up 5.3 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter.
The value of imported goods and services rose 0.3 percent in March following
sizable gains in the two preceding months. Most of the March increase was in
the value of imported oil, which was up sharply as a result of higher prices.

were widespread across categories, with the notable exception of aircraft.
Service imports were little changed in March, as an increase in travel and
passenger fares was offset by a large decrease in royalties and license fees,
which had been boosted in February by payments for Winter Olympic broadcast
rights. For the first quarter as a whole, total imports of goods and services were
up 14-1/2 percent at an annual rate. Total real imports of goods and services are
estimated by BEA to have risen almost 13 percent at an annual rate in the first
quarter.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose about 1 percent in May, following
double-digit increases in the two preceding months. The spot price of West
Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil has also risen on average since the beginning
of the year, and has recently traded around $25.50 per barrel, up from its average
value near $19 per barrel in December. After rising to about $29 per barrel in
mid-May, the price eased in response to comfortable stock levels, recent
indications that Venezuela is producing above its OPEC quota, and Russia's
publicly stated intention to increase oil exports. The market also appears to have
discounted the possibility of U.S. military intervention in Iraq in the near future.
Nevertheless, the expectation of world economic recovery and tensions in the
Middle East continue to put some upward pressure on prices.
Non-oil imports. The price of imported non-oil (and core) goods was down
0.1 percent in May following an upwardly-revised increase of 0.6 percent in
April. Food prices were up a little, while prices in all other major categories
were unchanged or down slightly. For April and May on average the core goods
price index was 1.7 percent at an annual rate above the first-quarter average,
following a decline of 2.6 percent in the first quarter. If sustained, this would be
the first quarterly increase in this index since the first quarter of 2001. The
turnaround is most noticeable in the price of industrial supplies, which was up
13 percent at an annual rate on average in April and May relative to the first
quarter following three quarters of double-digit declines.
Exports. Prices of total U.S. goods exports fell slightly in May and the price of
core goods was unchanged following an increase of 0.5 percent in April. A
small increase in the price of industrial supplies in May was largely offset by
declines in prices of agricultural products and capital goods. On average, the
price of core goods was 2.5 percent at an annual rate above the first-quarter
average, following a 1.3 percent decline in the first quarter.

IV-6
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners (line 4 of the Summary
table of U.S. International Transactions) rebounded strongly in March from the
low levels recorded for the first two months of the year. Despite this pickup in
March, foreign purchases were relatively weak for the first quarter as a whole,
continuing a trend toward slower purchases that started in the second half of
last year. Purchases in April were roughly in line with the first-quarter average.
March's pickup was concentrated in foreign purchases of U.S. debt. For
corporate debt (line 4c), the strong March figure coincided with a surge in new
corporate debt issuance, including an uptick in new eurobond issuance. For
Treasuries (line 4a), purchases in March just balanced sales earlier in the year
and were followed by significant sales in April. Agency bonds (line 4b) also
bounced back in March but rose further in April to offset the Treasury sales.
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. equities (line 4d) have remained
relatively steady this year through April, but are running somewhat below the
pace of last year.
U.S. residents made substantial net sales of foreign securities in March (line 5)
that offset small net purchases in the first two months. Net sales in the first
quarter outpaced those in the second half of last year and were in sharp contrast
to large purchases in the first half. In April, U.S. investors bought on net $3
billion of foreign securities. These net purchases were entirely in foreign
stocks (line 5b).
Foreign official reserves held in the United States rose $4 billion in April
following a small decrease in March and an increase of $10 billion for the first
quarter (line 1). For April, declines in reserves of G-10 countries (line la) were
more than offset by increases in the reserves of developing countries in Asia.
These data do not reflect Japanese intervention activity undertaken in early
May. Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that
total foreign official reserves increased by $23 billion in May, a large portion of
which is attributable to Japan.
In the U.S. banking sector, net outflows of $12 billion were recorded in April.
These outflows are primarily due to inter-office funding transactions of banks
in the United States with related offices in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia.
Balance of payments data for 2002:Q1, including direct investment capital
flows, will be released on June 20 and will be discussed in the Greenbook
supplement.

Foreign Exchange Markets
On balance, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against the major foreign
currencies has declined 2-3/4 percent since the last FOMC meeting. The dollar's
move lower was broad-based, led by a 4 percent decline against the euro. The
U.S. dollar depreciated 1-3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar and 2% percent
against the yen.
Sentiment toward the dollar generally deteriorated over the period. Market
participants tempered their outlook for near-term U.S. economic growth and
further pushed back expectations of monetary tightening. Expectations for
monetary tightening in the euro area were also scaled back, but to a lesser extent
than in the United States. A number of other factors may have weighed on the
dollar. Market commentary focused increasingly on the size of the U.S. current
account deficit, suggesting that the dollar may be poised for a large adjustment.
In addition, recent legislation allowing for farm subsidies, following earlier
impositions of steel and lumber tariffs, was interpreted by some investors as a
further signal that the Administration may be dissatisfied with the competitive
position of the dollar.

Early in the period, the yen appreciated sharply, prompting official intervention
to stem its rise. Japanese monetary authorities publicly confirmed that they
intervened in foreign exchange markets on four separate occasions, purchasing
dollars and selling yen.

Monetary policy tightening and indications of strong domestic demand in
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand appeared to support their respective
currencies, which appreciated 1-3/4, 4-3/4, and 8-1/2 percent against the U.S. dollar,
respectively. In Canada, stronger-than-expected first quarter GDP and
employment data showed a faster pace of economic recovery, prompting the
Bank of Canada to raise its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points on June 4
and to signal the potential for further monetary tightening. The Reserve Bank of
Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand tightened 50 and 25 basis
points, respectively, over the intermeeting period. In contrast, the Swiss
National Bank lowered its target range for 3-month Swiss franc LIBOR 50 basis
points to between 0.75 and 1.75 percent to counter strength in its currency. The
Swiss franc appreciated 3 percent against the dollar.

Foreign equity indices declined substantially during the intermeeting period, as
concerns about profits and corporate governance weighed on world share prices.
Euro-area equities fell nearly 10 percent, underperforming U.S. shares over the
intermeeting period. Declines in Asian stock indexes also outpaced declines in
U.S. stock indexes, with shares in Singapore and Hong Kong falling 8 and 9
percent, respectively. Japanese equities fell 6-3/4 percent. Sovereign bond yields
of foreign industrialized countries declined, but to a lesser extent than U.S.
Treasury yields. Against the backdrop of broad dollar weakness and heightened

The dollar's value against the currencies of our other important trading partners
rose about percent, largely reflecting the depreciation of the Mexican peso and
the Brazilian real. In Mexico, the peso declined 3 percent against the dollar, and
share prices fell 102 percent. Scaled-back market expectations for U.S. growth
contributed to the peso's decline. In Brazil, ongoing concerns about the
upcoming presidential election, given the strong lead of the Workers' Party
candidate, placed further downward pressure on the real and prompted an
increase of about 400 basis points in the spread of sovereign bond yields over
comparable Treasuries. The Argentine peso depreciated more than 10 percent
against the dollar, as progress on measures to stabilize the Argentine economy
remain stalled.

In contrast, in emerging Asian economies, the currencies of Indonesia, South
Korea, and Taiwan appreciated 7, 4-1/2, and 1-1/2 percent, respectively, against the
dollar, amid signs that recovery is continuing. On May 7, the Bank of Korea
raised its target overnight rate 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. The rise in the
yen also helped to support regional Asian currencies relative to the dollar.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Estimates of first-quarter real GDP for major foreign industrial countries
indicate that activity has picked up, but the pace and sources of growth varied
across countries. Domestic demand contributed significantly to growth in
Canada and the United Kingdom, while net exports provided a major boost to
growth in the euro area and Japan. Data for the second quarter suggest that the
foreign industrial economies are continuing to recover, with the United Kingdom
bouncing up to a growth rate above potential, Canada slowing somewhat from
the rapid growth seen in the first quarter, the euro area showing a modest
increase in growth, and Japan firming slightly.
Higher food and energy prices boosted rates of twelve-month headline consumer
price inflation in Europe and Canada earlier this year. Data for May, however,
indicate that these rates of inflation came down. Consumer price inflation fell to
1 percent in Canada, and in the euro-area, inflation fell to the European Central
Bank's (ECB's) 2 percent target ceiling. Core rates of inflation, however,
continued to rise in Canada and the euro area. In Japan, deflation continued, at
about a 1 percent rate.
Robust recovery and concerns about emerging price pressures led several foreign
central banks, notably those of Australia, New Zealand and Canada, to raise
official interest rates since the last FOMC meeting.
In Japan, real GDP rose 5.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) during the first quarter, marking
the first quarter of positive growth in a year. Growth was likely exaggerated,
however, by statistical quirks that overstated the strength of private consumption
and will most likely be revised down. Private consumption was reported to have
risen 6.6 percent, a much stronger increase than suggested by other indicators of
consumption. External demand added 2.7 percentage points to growth, with
exports surging about 28 percent after five consecutive quarterly declines and
with imports roughly flat. Residential investment declined about 9 percent.
Business fixed investment fell steeply for the second consecutive quarter,
plunging 12 percent. Public investment expanded roughly 17 percent, as
spending from last fiscal year's second supplementary budget kicked in,
contributing about 1 percentage point to growth. Inventories made a slight
negative contribution to growth.
Indicators suggest that a mild cyclical recovery continues in the second quarter.
Industrial production edged up 0.2 percent in April, the third consecutive
monthly gain. Household expenditures were flat in April compared with their
average first-quarter level, while new passenger car registrations expanded
briskly in April and May. Core machinery orders rose 8.4 percent in April and

IV-13
were up about 6 percent from their average first-quarter level. Residential and
nonresidential building starts rose in April, although they were still down from
their average first-quarter pace. The trade surplus narrowed in April, with rising
imports outpacing a small gain in exports.

Labor market conditions generally remain unfavorable, although recent data
show some improvement. The unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in
April, down from a record-high 5.5 percent in December. The job-offers-to-
applicants ratio, considered a key leading indicator of employment conditions,
edged up in April to 0.52, still well below its recent peak of 0.66 in December
2000. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food
but include energy) were down 1.1 percent from a year earlier in May.
Wholesale prices for domestic goods were roughly flat on a month-to-month
basis between February and May, but continued to be down on a twelve-month
basis. The GDP deflator in the first quarter was roughly 0.9 percent (n.s.a.)
below its year-earlier level.
In late May, Moody's downgraded Japan's domestic sovereign bond rating two
notches to A2, citing government indebtedness approaching "levels
unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world." The gross debt-to-

IV-14
GDP ratio is expected to reach 140 percent this year. The rating had been under
review for possible downgrade since February. Moody's also raised the rating
outlook for Japan to Stable, noting that the A2 rating incorporates an expectation
of further fiscal deterioration over the next few years.

On June 17, the ruling coalition agreed on a package of tax cuts, including tax
incentives to promote spending on R&D and lower taxes on inheritances and
gifts to encourage parents to transfer property to their children. The cuts are due
to take effect in January 2003. Other tax reform measures, such as lowering the
corporate tax rate and broadening the tax base, are reportedly under
consideration. The government has said that tax changes should be "revenue
neutral" or offset by reductions in government spending.

Euro-area real GDP data confirm that a modest recovery in exports helped the
economy grow 0.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, but domestic demand
continued to decline. Consumption spending fell 0.7 percent, the second
consecutive quarterly fall, and investment spending fell 2.6 percent, the fifth
consecutive decline. A further draw-down in inventories also subtracted from
growth. Among the three largest euro-area countries, French growth was the
strongest at 1.4 percent, and only France registered an increase in final domestic
demand.

Incoming data suggest that while growth is likely picking up a bit in the second
quarter, the recovery remains somewhat tentative and mixed across countries.
Euro-area industrial production declined 0.5 percent in April; gains in France
and Germany were offset by a sizable fall in Italy that in part reflected the one-
day general strike. The euro-area purchasing managers' index (PMI) for
manufacturing moved up again in May to reach its highest level in over a year.
However, the services PMI edged down in May after showing little improvement

IV-16
in April, suggesting that although activity continued to expand in the sector, it
likely stopped accelerating. After improving notably in the first quarter, euro-
area business sentiment also was little changed in April and May. Survey
indicators including PMIs and business sentiment have improved less for
Germany than for Italy and especially France. However, German industrial
orders surged in April to a level 1.8 percent above the average level in the first
quarter. Domestic orders were especially strong and reversed much of their
decline over the three previous months. Euro-area consumer sentiment has
picked up less than business sentiment; consumer sentiment in Italy has moved
lower in recent months and German consumer sentiment has been about flat.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole show limited deterioration, as the
harmonized unemployment rate has edged up from a low of 8.0 percent last fall
to 8.3 percent in April, still well below the average rates of over 10 percent in
the late 1990s. The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation
moved down to 2 percent in May, meeting the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling for
the first time in two years, but core inflation rose. Excluding food and energy
prices, the twelve-month inflation rate was 2.6 percent in May. Producer prices
remain below year-earlier levels.
In the second round of French parliamentary elections on June 16, the
center-right coalition headed by interim Prime Minister Jean-Francois Raffarin
won an absolute majority capturing 354 of the 577 seats in the National
Assembly. Raffarin was appointed Prime Minister after Lionel Jospin resigned
from politics following a poor showing by the left in the first round of the
French presidential election last month.
In its staff economic projections released on June 13, the ECB indicated that
euro-area real GDP growth is expected to pick up over the course of this year,
and next year annual growth is expected to be between 2.1 and 3.1 percent.
Domestic demand growth is also projected to gradually strengthen over the year.
Compared with the ECB's last published projections from December, the
outlook for GDP growth this year and next is little changed, but the ECB now
projects a somewhat weaker contribution from domestic demand. The ECB's
projections for inflation are about 3/4 percentage point higher for 2002 and about
1/2 percentage point higher for 2003 than in December. Based on an assumption
that bilateral euro exchange rates remain at their mid-May levels, annual
consumer price inflation is now projected to be a bit above 2 percent this year, in
large part reflecting the rise in oil prices earlier this year. In 2003, annual
inflation is expected to be between 1.3 and 2.5 percent.

In the first quarter of 2002, real GDP in the United Kingdom remained
essentially unchanged for the second consecutive quarter, although recent
upward revisions to industrial production and trade data suggest that real GDP
growth could be revised up to near 0.5 percent (s.a.a.r.). In the current estimate,
service sector growth slowed, particularly in finance and business services,
which contracted 0.2 percent, the first fall in ten years. The manufacturing sector
continued to be very weak, with a decline of 6 percent. Total domestic demand
grew 3.5 percent with slowing but firm consumption growth, strong government
consumption, and a significant positive contribution from inventories more than
offsetting a steep decline in investment. Net exports subtracted 3.6 percentage
points from growth, with a surge in imports and continued decline in exports.

Indicators for the second quarter suggest a pick-up in growth, although we note
that indicators for the first quarter had suggested stronger growth than reported in
the GDP release. Industrial production climbed 1.1 percent and manufacturing
rose 0.8 percent in April, following months of sustained decline. The
manufacturing sector's four-month-ahead output expectations fell somewhat in
May, though they still remained well above fourth-quarter lows. The
manufacturing PMI continued to indicate expansion, with the overall index, as
well as the indexes for output and new orders, remaining above 50 in May. Both
the total trade deficit and the trade deficit with the rest of the European Union
narrowed in April.
Retail sales in April surged 1.7 percent, though May's retail sales survey
suggested some slowing of growth for that month. The services PMI rose again
in May, showing continued expansion. Consumer confidence ticked down only
slightly in May, remaining around its pre-September level. Housing prices
accelerated in May, bringing the twelve-month growth rate to around 18 percent,
and household borrowing rose to record levels in May.
Notwithstanding the recent slow GDP growth, labor market conditions remain
tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate fell to 3.1 percent in May,
and the labor force survey measure of the unemployment rate edged up to 5.2

IV-19
percent for the three months centered in March. Both unemployment rates are
near record lows.

The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest
payments) dropped in May to 1.8 percent, the lowest inflation rate since the series
began in 1975. Moderation in inflation partly reflected the oil price increases that
led to a sharp rise in consumer prices in April and May of last year. The twelve-
month growth rate of average earnings rose to 4 percent in April.
In Canada, real GDP increased 6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, following
an upward revision of the fourth quarter to 2.9 percent. A decrease in the rate of
inventory reduction provided a strong contribution to growth, and final domestic
demand also increased briskly. Consumption growth was most prevalent in
interest-sensitive sectors such as automobiles and home furnishings. Residential
construction was at an all-time high in the first quarter. Non-residential
investment continued to decrease, largely reflecting a decline in business
construction. Business investment in machinery and equipment posted a small
gain following the fourth quarter's 10 percent drop. Both imports and exports
grew, after posting declines over the past year.

The overall capacity utilization rate increased in the first quarter for the first time
in six quarters. The increase was led by a rebound in the manufacturing sector,
with particularly strong contributions coming from the motor vehicle and
automotive parts industries. Corporate profits grew 67.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the
first quarter, reversing part of their steep drop over the previous three quarters.
May's all-industry PMI ticked up to 56.6 (n.s.a.), up from 55.9 in April.
Indicators suggest that Canada's interest-sensitive spending continued into the
second quarter. Housing starts fell in April, but then defied predictions of further
decline in May by returning to near January's twelve-year-high level. Motor
vehicle sales in April remained near December's record level, and preliminary
readings suggest that strong sales continued through May.
The unemployment rate rose in May to 7.7 percent. An increase in employment
was masked by strong labor force growth. Employment has expanded 1
percent since the start of the year, the largest five-month gain since 1994.
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation in May fell to 1 percent from
1.7 percent in April. The dramatic drop in the inflation rate largely reflected a
sharp energy-led increase in the level of the CPI index a year earlier. Twelve-

IV-21
month core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, increased to 2.4 percent
from 2.3 percent in April.
The Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate, its key policy rate,
25 basis points on June 4, following a similar 25 basis point increase on April 16.
The Bank cited stronger-than-expected Canadian growth in motivating both rate
hikes.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Since the last Greenbook, economic recovery has continued in emerging Asia,
with all countries recording positive growth in the first quarter, and indicators
for the second quarter signaling further expansion. In Latin America, Mexico's
recession has shown further signs of bottoming out. In Brazil, while recent data
releases have been mixed, the country's financial markets have experienced
intense downward pressures in recent weeks. Argentina and Venezuela are still
experiencing severe economic difficulties. Inflation has remained under control
in most countries, with the most notable exception being Argentina.
Argentina continued to experience financial and economic turmoil over the
intermeeting period. Deposits continued to decline, albeit at a much slower rate
than in April. In early June, the government unveiled a plan to convert bank
deposits into long-term peso- and dollar-denominated bonds on a voluntary
basis. The plan would also allow deposits to be used to purchase newly-issued
stocks and bonds, new cars, and real estate. However, critics of the plan, such as
the central bank (BCRA), believe that the plan will fail to stem the outflow of
deposits and could lead to more bank failures and to higher inflation.

Prospects for an IMF program in the near future remain uncertain. Although the
Argentine Congress recently altered the bankruptcy law and the "Economic
Subversion Law"-both pre-conditions for negotiations to advance-it is unclear
whether these actions have fully satisfied Fund expectations. The federal
government has also made some limited progress in restricting spending at the
provincial level, which is another precondition for a Fund program. While
relations between the IMF and the Argentine government remain strained, an
advance team from the IMF arrived in Argentina in mid-June to begin the
process of negotiations.
In response to the sustained depreciation of the peso, the BCRA tightened capital
controls in early June by further limiting sales of dollars by banks and requiring
exporters to sell their foreign exchange directly to the BCRA. The BCRA's
international reserves stood at about $10 billion as of mid-June, down from
$12 billion at the end of April. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from
18 percent in April to 23 percent in May, driven by the sharp depreciation of the
peso since January. The federal government's fiscal balance registered an
improvement in May reflecting, in large part, temporary factors boosting tax
revenues. The trade balance continued to improve, as imports slumped.
In Mexico, recent indicators suggest that an economic recovery is underway.
Even though the decline in first-quarter real GDP of 1 percent (s.a.a.r.) marked
the sixth consecutive quarter of decline, this weakness is partly attributable to
difficulties in seasonally adjusting the data for this year's early Easter. Recent
monthly indicators are consistent with a bounce back in activity: after falling in
March, industrial production rebounded sharply in April. Furthermore, exports
rose about 4 percent (s.a.) in April, and automobile production was up nearly
19 percent from a year earlier, after several months of decline. Consistent with a
recovery in demand, imports have also increased in April. In May, the inflation
rate remained only a little above the Bank of Mexico's year-end twelve-month
target of 4-1/2 percent. However, there are some concerns about inflation
expectations, arising from pass-through effects due to the recent depreciation of
the Mexican currency; since mid-April, when the Bank of Mexico eased policy a
bit, the peso has depreciated by more than 6 percent, on net, against the dollar.

In Brazil, real GDP jumped 5.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. However,
there were sizeable differences in growth across sectors. Agriculture and
services output rose briskly, while industrial output declined nearly 6 percent.
Indicators for the second quarter paint a mixed picture. Industrial production
rebounded more than 4 percent in April, but was boosted by residual seasonal
effects related to Easter falling in March. Other recent indicators, such as rising
unemployment, have pointed to a weakening in domestic demand. Twelve-
month inflation in May edged down to 7.8 percent. The trade surplus narrowed
in May, due in part to a sharp drop in shipments to Argentina.
Sharp declines in Brazilian asset prices in recent weeks have put the country
back into the spotlight. Since the end of April, the EMBI+ spread over U.S.
Treasuries has risen from 850 basis points to 1325 basis points, and the real has
depreciated 15 percent against the dollar. These financial pressures have been
attributed to increased market anxieties about the outcome of October's
presidential election and the prospective policies of the next president. These
developments have reinforced concerns about the economy's underlying
vulnerabilities, particularly the heavy public sector debt burden. In early June,
investors' increasing reluctance to hold debt that matures after early 2003
induced the Brazilian government to shorten the maturity profile of its debt. On

June 12, Brazil's government announced that it will draw on a $10 billion IMF

The economic news from Venezuela since the last Greenbook has been
worrisome, and political tensions have remained high. Output plunged over
15-1/2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter following a decline of almost 4 percent
in the final quarter of last year. Since being floated in mid-February, the bolivar
has depreciated almost one-third. To date, however, weak demand conditions
have muted the depreciation's pass-through into consumer prices, which rose
18.3 percent over the twelve months ending in May. The net decline in oil
prices since mid-2001 has caused Venezuela's current account to move from a
comfortable surplus in the first half of last year to balance in the first quarter of
this year. Weak tax receipts and lower oil revenues have generated a growing
fiscal deficit and, despite some increases in tax rates, a budget deficit of
3-to-4 percent of GDP is projected for this year. Continued political instability
and rumors of another coup are helping to keep spreads elevated, making deficit
financing through bond issuance extremely costly.

Korean economic indicators over the intermeeting period have shown further
strong performance. GDP jumped 7.6 percent at an annual rate in the first
quarter, reflecting solid consumer and construction demand, as well as large
increases in exports and in machinery and equipment investment. Government
spending also rose briskly, likely related to preparations for the World Cup
soccer championship. Industrial production was up 1.8 percent in April. A
sharp pickup in exports in the first quarter boosted the trade surplus and led to a
sizable current account surplus. In April, a pickup in imports resulted in a more
moderate trade surplus and a flat current account. The unemployment rate so far
in the second quarter was about even with the first-quarter average. Consumer
price inflation ticked up to 3 percent in May, but remains well within the central
bank's 2 to 4 percent target range. On May 7, the central bank raised its target
interest rate 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.

Recent data for the ASEAN region confirm that the strong recovery, which
began in the fourth quarter, has continued. Thailand led the pack in the first
quarter with real GDP growth of almost 10 percent (s.a.a.r.), and robust growth
was also reported in Singapore (7.6 percent), Indonesia (5.1 percent), and to a
lesser extent in Malaysia (3.7 percent). The Philippines, after growing almost
4 percent last year, posted growth of just 0.8 percent in the first quarter, largely
due to weakness in the agricultural sector. The April industrial production
figures that have been reported for the region have all shown faster growth than
in the first quarter, with production in Singapore rising 11 percent in April,
primarily due to growth in high-tech production.
Most countries in the region have continued to report strong trade surpluses
since the last Greenbook, although the most recent numbers suggest variation
across countries. Trade surpluses in Indonesia and Singapore have increased on
average in the second quarter, reflecting strong export growth, while a surge in
imports to Malaysia and Thailand caused the trade balances of those countries to
drop sharply. In recent months, inflation in the region has decreased, and
deflationary pressures in Singapore appear to have intensified.

In China, signs point to a continuation of strong growth. Industrial production
rose more than 12 percent in April and May on a twelve-month basis, well above
the 8 percent first-quarter pace. Foreign direct investment and investment by
state-owned enterprises are both significantly above their levels at this time last
year. On the consumer side, retail sales are up 8 percent over a year ago. The
trade surplus was smaller in April and May than in the first quarter, as imports
have picked up considerably while exports have held steady. The rate of
deflation in April increased to more than 1 percent. Many domestic firms are
cutting prices to match declines in import prices, which have moved down as a
result of tariff cuts that China is making as part of WTO accession.

Hong Kong's real GDP rose 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, as a large
positive contribution from net exports offset a steep decline in private
investment. The unemployment rate moved above 7 percent in April; the
difficult conditions in the labor market, while not confined to any particular
sector of the economy, have been especially acute in the construction industry.
Recent indicators suggest that the property market may be bottoming out.
Property price declines appeared to moderate in the first quarter, and the number
of transactions has stabilized. Consumer prices declined 3 percent for the year
ending in April, as the appreciated real exchange rate and sluggish domestic
economy have continued to drag down prices. The trade deficit narrowed
somewhat in April.

Taiwan grew more than 7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. Net
exports were the driving force behind the growth, but fixed investment also
expanded for the first time in over a year. A further sign of continued recovery
is a decline in the unemployment rate to 5 percent in April. Industrial
production has continued to rise, and the growth has been particularly strong for
Taiwan's high-tech industries. Both exports and imports have moved up on
average in April and May, although the increase in imports has been more rapid
and has resulted in the trade surplus shrinking from its first-quarter level.
Consumer prices have been roughly flat this year after falling most of last year.
