Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The expansion in economic activity is continuing, but at a relatively subdued
pace. In the second quarter, final sales were stagnant, and inventory investment
provided a smaller lift to production than in the first quarter. The few shreds of
evidence we have in hand suggest that domestic demand probably is moving up
early this quarter. Despite recent declines in the stock market and consumer
sentiment, motor vehicle sales were extraordinarily strong in July, and a
contraction in household spending on other consumer items is not apparent thus
far. New orders for nondefense capital goods, a leading indicator of business
investment spending, fell in June, but they have crept up on balance since early
this year. In broad terms, labor demand has been weak in recent months, and
industrial activity appears to have leveled off in July. Core price inflation
remains quiescent.
Real GDP
According to the advance estimate prepared by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA), real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the
second quarter. Based on new data on inventory investment, construction
expenditures, and shipments of capital goods, we now estimate that real GDP
rose at an annual rate of 1.2 percent last quarter.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market has not improved appreciably in recent months. Although
private nonfarm payrolls rose in June and July, aggregate hours of production or
nonsupervisory workers recorded a steep drop in July. The unemployment rate
was unchanged in July, after having edged up in June. The four-week moving
average of initial claims has moved down a bit in recent weeks and now stands
at a level consistent with modest employment growth.
In the payroll survey, manufacturing employment declined 7,000 in July, its
smallest loss in two years. However, the manufacturing workweek fell 0.4 hour
in July, to 40.7 hours, reversing all of its gain since February. In addition, the
help-supply industry, which provides many employees to manufacturers, shed
nearly as many jobs in July as were added, on average, in each month of the
second quarter. Another dark spot was the construction industry, which lost
30,000 jobs in July, more than reversing June's rise. Moreover, the
transportation, communications, and utilities industries and the finance,
insurance, and real estate industries have not yet seen a turnaround. On a more
positive note, the service industry excluding help-supply services added

85,000 jobs last month, triple the second-quarter average, and retail trade added
12,000 jobs after having shed workers in May and June.
After rising slightly to 34.3 hours in June, average weekly hours of production
or nonsupervisory workers dropped to 34.0 hours in July, the lowest level since
last October. The decline in the workweek was widespread across industries.
Although some of this dip may reflect temporary factors, such as abnormal
seasonal patterns, most is probably attributable to continued sluggishness in the
demand for labor.2 The meager increase in private employment in combination
with the large decline in the workweek led to a fall in aggregate weekly hours of
0.6 percent in July.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.9 percent in June
and stayed at that level in July. Other indicators from this survey also showed
little, if any, signs of improvement. The mean duration of unemployment edged
down in July but remains higher than in the first quarter. In addition, the labor
force participation rate ticked down in July to a level below that of the fourth
quarter of last year.
The unemployment insurance claims data have been somewhat volatile over the
past month, a condition reflecting difficulties in seasonal adjustment during
July, when the timing and number of temporary plant closings in the motor
vehicle and textile industries can vary from year to year.3 However, the four-
week moving average of initial claims, which smooths through the seasonal
volatility, has fallen about 10,000 over the month, to 386,000. Meanwhile, the
four-week moving average of insured unemployment has declined nearly
170,000 during the past month and currently stands at 3.54 million. Although
this drop partly reflects a slower inflow into insured unemployment, the number
of recipients exhausting their regular benefits has been high as well in recent
months, reflecting the expiration of the benefit period for individuals who were
added to the UI rolls in the wake of the sizable layoffs of late 2001 and early
2002. Outside insured unemployment, the number of individuals receiving
1. Two potential labor disputes pose the risk of disruptions to economic activity in coming
months. One is a possible strike by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU).
Its contract expired on July 1, and since then workers have been operating under successive
24-hour contract extensions. Although a strike is not deemed likely, the groups last met on
July 25, at which time the ILWU said that it did not intend to return to the bargaining table until
at least August 13. Another uncertainty is the fate of the Canadian Auto Workers' negotiations
with the Big Three auto makers, which began in mid-July. A failure to agree on a contract could
result in layoffs and production disruptions in the U.S. plants that depend on parts from Canada.
2. A fraction of the drop may be the result of a greater-than-normal incidence of extended
July 4th holidays.
3. The Employment Training Administration's introduction of new seasonal factors has
significantly reduced the volatility of the data, but the new factors do not completely eliminate
the problem.

Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) benefits decreased
200,000 in mid-July from the peak in early June as benefits began to expire for
the first round of recipients.4
Other indicators are consistent with a relatively torpid labor market. The help-
wanted index ticked up in June but remains near its recent low point. Although
the number of layoffs announced by firms has declined on balance since the
beginning of the year, consumer expectations for employment conditions
deteriorated significantly in July, according to both the Michigan SRC and
Conference Board surveys. In addition, the latter indicated that the fraction of
households reporting that jobs were plentiful fell and the fraction reporting that
jobs were hard to get rose in July for the second month in a row. Nonetheless,
the proportion of individuals reporting that jobs are hard to get is still well
below the level reached in the period following the 1990-91 recession (the so-
called "jobless recovery"). Looking ahead, fewer respondents to the National
Federation of Independent Businesses July survey expect to expand employment
in the coming months than had in the June survey.
We now estimate that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at
an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2002, following unusually

4. Indirectly, the level of insured unemployment continues to be elevated by the TEUC
program. Individuals close to exhausting their regular benefits likely anticipate receiving
additional benefits through TEUC; therefore, they may search less intensively for jobs and thus
remain on state benefit rolls longer than they otherwise would have.

large increases in the previous two quarters.5 Over the four quarters ended in
the second quarter of 2002, productivity rose 4.7 percent, after having shown
almost no growth over the previous four-quarter period. And, while the contour
of the revised data now shows a more typical cyclical pattern, the strong
rebound in productivity in 2001:Q4 and 2002:Q1 still leaves the level of output
per hour well above our estimated level of structural productivity.
Industrial Production
Initial indicators suggest that industrial production was flat in July, slowing
sharply from the 0.8 percent gain posted in June. Aggregate hours of production
workers in manufacturing dropped steeply in July, more than offsetting June's
outsized increase. However, the physical product data in hand show a rise in the
production of motor vehicles and parts and a jump in the generation of
electricity owing to warmer-than-average temperatures.
We estimate that total motor vehicle assemblies increased to an annual rate of
about 12.7 million units in July, a bit higher than the 12.6 million unit pace in
June. For the third quarter as a whole, automakers report that production is
scheduled at 12.8 million units, a noticeable step-up from the 12.4 million
average pace of the second quarter. Auto companies expect that strong sales

will keep inventories at desired levels in the current quarter. Elsewhere in the
transportation sector, the production of aircraft and parts continues to decline.
During the second quarter, the output of commercial aircraft fell at an annual
rate of 54 percent, leaving the level of production about 48 percent below its
peak in November 2000. However, confidential industry reports suggest that
commercial aircraft production will decline less rapidly in the third quarter.
In the high-tech sector, the most recent semiconductor data suggest that output
increases in July were significantly slower than in the second quarter, when
production increased at an annual rate of more than 40 percent. In the second
quarter, the production of chips other than microprocessors increased sharply,
more than offsetting a significant deceleration in the real output of
microprocessors (MPUs). Looking ahead, Intel's revenue outlook indicates that
the contribution of MPUs to real semiconductor output may continue to shrink
in the third quarter.6 In reports consistent with the outlook at Intel,
semiconductor equipment makers say that orders remain at a low level, although
their book-to-bill ratio edged up again in June.
The recent performance of high-tech industries downstream from
semiconductors has been mixed. The production of computers increased at an
annual rate of 20 percent during the second quarter, significantly slower than in
the first quarter. A Dataquest forecast of a decline in unit sales of computers in
the third quarter suggests that the real production of PCs (that is, adjusted for
quality change) may remain sluggish. The production of communications
equipment fell again during the second quarter, albeit much less steeply than
during the first quarter. Announced reductions in capital spending plans by
telecommunications service providers continue to suggest that demand from this
sector will remain a drag on communications equipment output for some time.
By contrast, the production of local-area-network equipment (a segment of
communications equipment used by general business) has increased about
1 percent per month since December. Surveys of chief information officers and
of business economists suggest that the share of companies planning to increase
spending on high-tech equipment in the near term is greater than it was in the
first quarter. Although spending plans on networking equipment in July were
slightly less enthusiastic than in recent months, plans for spending on computers
moved up.
Factory output outside high-tech, motor vehicles, and aircraft increased among
nearly all major market groups in the second quarter. The output of construction
supplies and durable consumer goods excluding motor vehicles and high-tech
continues to be supported by the high level of activity in the housing market.
6. In 2001, Intel accounted for about 80 percent of worldwide MPU revenue, and more than
80 percent of Intel revenue was derived from MPUs.

Weekly physical output data for appliances suggest that the production of
durable consumer goods increased again in July. The output of business
supplies and business equipment outside high-tech, motor vehicles, and aircraft,
which had been lagging the turnaround in other market groups, increased in
June and for the second quarter as a whole.
Recent indicators of future activity in the industrial sector have softened
notably. After having risen in April, the staff's series on real adjusted durable
goods orders was flat in May and fell in June. The new-orders diffusion index
from the Institute of Supply Management fell sharply in July, to a level
indicating that about the same number of respondents reported a decline in new
orders as reported an increase. The number of manufacturing layoffs announced
in July was a bit less than in June, and in both months layoffs were concentrated
among high-tech industries.

During the first six months of 2002, production gains averaged nearly
1/2 percent per month, about 0.3 percentage point less than the increases
recorded, on average, during the first six months of the previous recoveries in
IP. Whereas the recovery in the output of materials has been only a little more
sluggish than usual, the recovery in the production of intermediate and final
products has been distinctly subpar. An important factor behind this atypical

II-13
pattern is that the production of construction supplies (buoyed by homebuilding)
and motor vehicles (held up by aggressive financing incentives) were relatively
well maintained during the downturn.
Consumer Spending
The pace of consumer spending quickened early this summer after having fallen
off in May. However, this rebound in spending came largely from substantial
advances in motor vehicle expenditures in June and July. Thus far, deteriorating
fundamentals-such as the erosion in share prices and the slide in consumer
confidence-do not appear to be causing a retrenchment in spending.
Sales of light vehicles jumped to an annual rate of 18.1 million units in July-up
from a 16.3 million unit average pace over the first half of the year.
Confidential data indicate that almost all of the increase in July came in retail
sales; fleet sales were reported to be up only a bit last month. According to the
automakers, the reintroduction of zero percent financing initiatives in early July
accounted for the surge, even though the level of overall price incentives
(including financing and rebates) was increased less than $100 per vehicle.7
Expenditures on non-motor-vehicle goods and services increased at an annual
rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter. Within this category, spending
gains on goods were notably smaller than in the first quarter, while outlay gains
on services continued apace. Meanwhile, real household incomes increased at
an annual rate of close to 4 percent in the second quarter.
Among other recent indicators, chain store sales through the end of July, while
not particularly robust, are consistent with a small rise in spending on goods
apart from motor vehicles. Similarly, mixed anecdotal reports from the Reserve
Banks suggest that spending gains in July were small, while record-breaking
stock market trading volumes and unusually hot weather likely increased service
outlays last month.
The personal saving rate rose to 4.0 percent in the second quarter, 2 percentage
points above its year-ago level. The wealth declines of the past two years
continue to put substantial downward pressure on spending growth, and in the
second quarter the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income
fell to its lowest level since early 1996. The stock market's drop in July likely
pushed this ratio down further.
7. General Motors and Ford have released some information on pricing of 2003 model-year
cars and light trucks. Although price increases on many GM models reportedly will be small,
base prices may increase as much as 4 percent on some popular models. In addition, equipment
that is now standard will become optional on the 2003 vehicles, a move that effectively raises the
price. Ford has announced that average prices for its 2003 comparably equipped vehicles will
rise 0.4 percent.

Consumer sentiment dropped markedly in July. Both the Conference Board and
Michigan surveys of consumer sentiment declined to their lowest levels since
the start of the year. According to the Michigan survey, almost all the
households reported hearing of unfavorable changes in business conditions, a
response likely driven by news of declining share prices. Indeed, the proportion
of households reporting unfavorable news about the stock market rose to its
highest level since the October 1987 stock market crash. Accordingly,
households' outlook for future business conditions took the brunt of the decline
in confidence in July, falling 22 points in the Michigan survey and 5 points in
the Conference Board survey. These responses do not appear to indicate an
overall rollback in consumer attitudes: The remaining subindexes of consumer
sentiment declined less sharply than future business conditions, and appraisals
of buying conditions for houses and cars improved.
Housing Markets
The housing sector continues to be strong, buoyed by a favorable financing
environment. We estimate that real spending in the residential sector increased
at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the second quarter, and the pace of
housing starts and permit issuance indicate that the level of activity likely
remained strong going into the third quarter. Although starts of single-family
homes dropped back to an annual rate of 1.35 million units in June from an
elevated pace in May, the pace of homebuilding in the second quarter as a whole
remained well above that seen during the preceding few years. Issuance of
permits to build new single-family homes-adjusted for starts that occurred in
areas where permits are not required-was also robust in June, albeit less so
than were starts themselves. Because the level of starts usually reverts to the
level of permits, the pace of single-family starts appears on track to slow a bit
more in the coming months while remaining at a high level by historical
standards.
Low and falling mortgage rates continued to support housing activity: The
average contract rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage moved down to
6.4 percent in early August, and the initial rate on a thirty-year adjustable-rate
mortgage declined to 4.5 percent. Low mortgage rates have helped keep
consumers' rating of homebuying conditions-as measured by the Michigan
Survey-at a high level despite a weak labor market and a steep decline in the
stock market. Indeed, the volume of mortgage applications has remained at
near-record levels, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Sales of new homes edged up 1/2 percent in June to a record annual rate of
1.0 million units. The stock of new homes for sale was about unchanged in June
at a level equal to about four months of sales at the current sales pace. This
low level of inventory suggests that the robust pace of production noted above
has not been unwarranted. In contrast, sales of existing homes fell sharply in
June to an annual rate of about 5.1 million units, putting the level of sales near

the bottom of the range seen during the last few years. However, the reported
decline appears to have been exaggerated by the procedures used by the
National Association of Realtors (NAR) to seasonally adjust the data. In
particular, NAR does not correctly account for the number of business days in a
month.8
Although house prices continued to rise through the second quarter, they may be
decelerating. For example, the increase in the quality-adjusted median price of
new homes was 2-3/4 percent during the year that ended last quarter, compared
with a 4-3/4 percent gain during the previous year. And, while the median
purchase price of existing homes has shown no sign of deceleration, the repeat-
sales index-which controls for some of the changes in the composition of
homes sold that can affect the median price-slowed sharply in the first half of
this year. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the weakening is concentrated at the
high end of the market.
In the multifamily sector, June starts were at an annual rate of 320,000 units, a
bit below the average pace since the mid-1990s. Vacancy rates in the rental
segment of this sector have moved up rapidly during the past year to levels last
seen in the mid-1990s. In addition, rents have decelerated and, by some
measures, even fallen in recent months. On the other hand, conditions in the
market for condominiums and cooperative apartments appear robust. These
factors appear to be offsetting, and the strong permits figure for June suggests
that the pace of multifamily starts will be little changed in the near term.
Business Fixed Investment
Equipment and software. We estimate that real business spending on
equipment and software increased at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the
second quarter after having fallen in the first quarter. Excluding the volatile
transportation sector, real outlays increased 6-1/2 percent in the second quarter.
However, despite improving fundamentals-such as rising output and profits,
new tax incentives, and a low cost of capital-firms remain cautious. We have
no direct evidence on investment in the current quarter, but the recent data on
orders and shipments of capital goods and numerous anecdotal reports point to
another lackluster gain in spending on business equipment and software.
In the high-tech sector, real outlays increased 10 percent in the second quarter.
Nominal new bookings for high-tech equipment fell more than 12 percent (not
at an annual rate) in June, more than offsetting the increases in April and May;
8. June had five weekends instead of the usual four. With fewer business days, fewer house-
purchase closings occurred. Using staff seasonal adjustment factors that allow for such trading-
day effects, existing home sales declined only 2-1/4 percent in June to a level well above that
seen in 2001 as a whole.

II-21
with prices continuing to decline in the sector, this pattern of nominal orders is
consistent with only a moderate increase in real spending in the current quarter.
Furthermore, recent anecdotal evidence, such as the expectations of analysts
who cover high-tech companies, our own informal surveys, and the Beige Book,
suggests muted gains.

A sharp decline in aircraft expenditures caused business spending on
transportation-related items to fall in the second quarter to a level not seen in
four years. Because of long production lags, the steep falloff in air traffic last
fall is only now being fully played out in aircraft expenditures. Consequently,
we expect aircraft spending to fall further in the current quarter. In contrast,
business demand for motor vehicles continues to improve, although some of the
recent strength may prove to be temporary. After steep declines over the second
half of last year, fleet sales of light vehicles have risen on balance since the
beginning of the year. Sales of medium and heavy trucks rose in the second
quarter owing to an especially large jump in sales of heavy trucks in advance of
new EPA regulations that go into effect in October.9 After the spring-time rush
to place orders to assure delivery by the end of September, new orders for heavy

perform worse than engines built under current specifications.

trucks (class 8) dropped back in May and June. Orders for medium trucks
(classes 5 to 7) have been volatile but continued to trend upward through June.
Real spending on equipment apart from of the high-tech and transportation
categories is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 7 percent last
quarter, the second consecutive quarter of robust demand for this broad category
of capital goods. However, new orders for equipment and machinery (excluding
transportation and high-tech) dropped 3-3/4 percent in June (not at an annual
rate), a break from the upward trend since early this year. Thus, spending on
this grouping of equipment appears likely to slow some in coming months.
Nonresidential construction. Real spending on the construction of
nonresidential structures continued to fall in the second quarter.10 Expenditures
were lower in most major components; the industrial, office, and other
commercial sectors saw particularly large declines. Incorporating the most
recent figures on the value of construction put-in-place, we now estimate that
real spending on industrial construction declined at an annual rate of 45 percent
in the second quarter to a level less than half that recorded in 1999. Spending in
the other commercial sector-which includes retail and wholesale
buildings-fell at an annual rate of about 25 percent last quarter, more than
reversing the first quarter's large increase. By contrast, spending in the
institutional sector, a recent bright spot, was up again in the second quarter.
Although construction spending on office buildings was down again in the
second quarter, the amount of occupied office space increased last quarter for
the first time since the end of 2000. Vacancy rates did edge up again last
quarter, from 15.4 percent to 15.6 percent, but the increase was the smallest in
almost two years. In contrast, the weakening in the industrial sector has shown
few signs of abating: The amount of occupied industrial space decreased, albeit
more slowly than it did during the previous year. The vacancy rate continued its
sharp ascent, reaching 10.9 percent, the highest reading since 1988, the first year
for which comparable data are available.
Real outlays for drilling and mining structures increased 2.8 percent in the
second quarter. The number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs in
operation-which is used by the BEA to estimate spending in this
sector--edged up in July, suggesting that spending was rising slightly.
10. New data on the value of construction put-in-place in June, along with revisions to the
April and May figures, were released after the advance GDP report. On the basis of these data,
we now estimate that real spending on nonresidential construction fell at an annual rate of
19.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a published decrease of 14 percent.

Business Inventories
Taking on board the latest data for inventory investment in manufacturing and
wholesale trade in June, we now estimate that real nonfarm inventories
increased at an annual rate of $4.9 billion in the second quarter, after a
$35.1 billion drop in the last quarter. As a result, the change in r
inventory investment is estimated to have increased real GDP gri
1-1/2 percentage points in the second quarter after having added
2-1/2 percentage points to first-quarter growth.
We estimate that manufacturers liquidated real inventories at a $13.9 billion
annual rate in the second quarter, after a $31.2 billion reduction in the first
quarter. Most of the liquidation in the second quarter occurred at manufacturers
of machinery and of computers and electronic products. Real wholesale
inventories (excluding motor vehicles) fell at a $11.4 billion annual rate last
quarter after a similar liquidation in the first quarter. A good part of the
drawdown in the second quarter was at wholesalers of machinery and electrical
goods. Real retail inventories (excluding motor vehicles) are estimated to have
risen at a $5.2 billion annual rate last quarter after a moderate accumulation in
the first quarter.

electrical equipment excluding high-tech jumped in June to its highest level
since 1993. Excessive days' supply ratios have been eliminated in nearly all
other categories.
Government Sector
Federal. The federal government recorded a $29 billion surplus in June, about
the same as a year earlier. However, adjusted for payment timing, the budget
actually deteriorated, with the surplus falling from $42 billion in June 2001 to
$18 billion in June 2002. Over the twelve months ending in June, the adjusted
budget recorded a deficit of $167 billion compared with a $227 billion surplus
during the preceding twelve months, a deterioration of almost $400 billion.
Receipts in June 2002 were 10 percent below last year's level, reflecting the
continued effects of tax law changes, the weak economy, and falling stock
prices. Withheld and FICA tax payments fell 7 percent, owing to the effects of
the new withholding schedules and the weak economy. Nonwithheld income
taxes and social insurance contributions dropped 17 percent, a drop consistent
with a sharp reduction in capital gains realizations. A 12 percent decline in
corporate income tax payments reflects the tax cuts enacted in March. Over the
twelve months ending in June, receipts fell $263 billion relative to the previous
twelve-month period, with sizable declines in both individual and corporate
taxes.
Outlays fell 10 percent in June, but after adjusting for shifts in payments when
the first of the month falls on a nonworking day, outlays were 2 percent above a
year earlier, well below the increases seen earlier this year. Over the twelve
months ending in June, adjusted outlays increased $131 billion, fueled by sharp
increases for, among other things, defense, income security, and Medicaid.
11. The FRB staff's flow-of-goods system measures changes in inventories by tracking the
flow of goods in the economy. The system divides the output from the staffs industrial
production indexes into more than seventy product categories. For each product category, the
system estimates the supply of goods flowing into the economy-that is, domestic production
plus imports. The system then estimates how much of the supply flows out, whether as final
demand, including exports, or as inputs for other goods. The difference between the amount
flowing in and the amount flowing out represents the change in inventories. There is inventory
accumulation if inflows exceed outflows and inventory liquidation if outflows exceed inflows.

The surplus projections released in mid-July in the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Midsession Review of the Budget reflect the budget
deterioration. Assuming enactment of the President's proposals, OMB now
expects the budget to show a deficit of $165 billion in fiscal 2002, $59 billion
larger than they had projected last February. However, the Administration
believes that the factors responsible for the downward revision are largely
transitory, and thus its budget projections for subsequent years are only slightly
worse than those it issued in February. The Administration projects that the
deficit will narrow appreciably in 2003 and 2004 and return to surplus in fiscal
2005.
The Congress recently passed a supplemental appropriations bill that boosts
outlays about $7 billion in fiscal 2002 and $11 billion in fiscal 2003. About
one-half of the additional spending is for defense, while most of the rest is for
homeland security and aid to New York City.
State and local governments. After having incorporated the construction data
for June, we estimate that real spending by state and local governments fell at an
annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in the second quarter, after a 4.6 percent increase in
the first quarter. Real consumption expenditures, which had already slowed
appreciably in the first quarter, rose at an annual rate of only 1.6 percent in the
second quarter. The slowdown reflects the effects of the various spending
adjustments that many states and some localities have made as they address
projected budget gaps.
Real outlays for construction, which currently make up about three-fourths of
the sector's investment, fell sharply in the second quarter, but the level of
construction spending remains quite high in historical terms; gains in
construction were unusually strong at the end of 2001 and early this year as
much of the winter turned out to be unusually warm or dry.
State and local government employment fell 13,000 in July after a 21,000
increase in June. The large decline in local noneducation employment reversed
most of the increase in June. Also, state noneducation employment fell 3,000,
its third consecutive monthly decline, likely reflecting hiring freezes and layoffs
by some governments.
According to the revised NIPA data, the state and local sector has recorded
growing budget deficits since the end of 2000, in sharp contrast to the
substantial surpluses estimated over this period prior to the annual GDP
revision. Moreover, estimates by the National Conference of State Legislatures
regarding the balance-sheet position of the states at the end of fiscal 2002
(June 30 for most states) confirm the reports of a deterioration in their budget
positions: Combined general and rainy-day funds fell more than 40 percent last
year, the second consecutive drop, after having risen steadily from 1993 to

2000. Even so, balances in these funds appear to have been equal to about
5 percent of general fund expenditures at the end of fiscal 2002. Although
down from unusually high levels in the late 1990s and 2000, when they topped
out at more than 10 percent of expenditures, the condition of the funds is still
adequate, just matching the benchmark most market analysts use to assign a
favorable fiscal assessment and a strong bond rating. Nevertheless, states are
responding to budgetary pressures by cutting spending plans and raising taxes.
Indeed, a net increase in taxes enacted in fiscal 2002 was the first in nearly a
decade.
Prices and Labor Costs
Inflation remained on a downtrend through midyear. Both the total CPI and the
PCE price indexes decelerated sharply over the past year; although some of this
slowdown in inflation reflected developments in the food and energy sectors
that seem unlikely to persist, core inflation eased a bit as well.
Consumer energy prices held steady, on balance, in June, after a sharp decline in
May. Energy prices have swung widely from month to month this year, but
over the twelve months ending in June, energy prices were down more than
11 percent, compared with an 8-1/2 percent increase during the previous
twelve-month period. Prices for natural gas have been particularly weak the
past few months; and unusually rapid buildups of inventories are reducing the
risk of price increases later this year.
With ample supplies of livestock and fruits and vegetables, changes in prices for
consumer foods have been muted in recent months. Over the twelve months
ending in June, consumer food prices rose 1.6 percent compared with an
increase of 3.4 percent over the preceding twelve-month period. Poor growing
conditions this past winter set back the wheat crop, and wet planting conditions
that gave way to hot, dry weather have imperiled the corn and soybean crops.
Widespread rain and cooler temperatures toward the last week of July benefited
corn and soybeans, but the condition of those two crops nevertheless remains
considerably worse than in the past several years. As a result of the concerns
about harvests, prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat have run up substantially in
recent weeks, although secondary food processors tend to damp the ultimate
impact of changes in crop prices on consumer food prices.
Consumer prices other than food and energy rose 0.1 percent in June, and on a
twelve-month basis, core consumer prices were up 2.3 percent, compared with a
2.7 percent increase in the preceding twelve months. The deceleration in the
core CPI has been especially pronounced for goods prices, which fell 1 percent
in the twelve months ended in June, compared with a year-earlier increase of
0.3 percent. By contrast, prices of non-energy services, which rose 3.7 percent
in the twelve months ended in June, were unchanged relative to the year-earlier
reading.

The PCE price index for items other than food and energy was up 1.6 percent
over the twelve months ended in June, compared with a 1.9 percent increase in
the preceding twelve months. The slowing in core PCE inflation came from the
market-based components of the index, which increased 1.3 percent in the
twelve months ended in June, compared with 1.9 percent for the preceding year.
By contrast, the part of core PCE for which market-based prices are not
available is estimated to have risen 2.8 percent in the twelve months ended in
June, up a full percentage point from a year earlier.
Broader measures of inflation have slowed markedly in recent quarters. The
chain-weighted price index for GDP increased 1 percent in the four quarters
ended at midyear, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in the preceding
four-quarter period. Although much of the slowdown reflected weaker food and
energy prices, the core index increased 1.4 percent in the four quarters ended in
the second quarter, a deceleration of 0.6 percentage point from the previous
year.
Despite the slowing that is apparent in most gauges of inflation, survey
measures of inflation expectations have not shown much deceleration in recent
months. According to the Michigan survey, median one-year-ahead inflation
expectations were 2.6 percent in July, about the same as the readings from last
summer and considerably above the responses from late last year. Longer-term
inflation expectations also have changed little, with the median five-year to ten-
year-ahead expectation of 2.8 percent in July well within the 2-3/4 percent to
3 percent range that has prevailed for the past several years.
Although commodity prices generally have rebounded from a nosedive that
occurred around the turn of the year, few inflationary pressures seem to be
coming yet from earlier stages of processing. The PPI for intermediate
materials other than food and energy rose 0.2 percent in June but was still
1 percent below the previous year's level. Prices for core crude materials rose
substantially in May and June to a level 6.2 percent greater than one year
earlier, a stark contrast to the 11 percent decline posted in the preceding twelve
months. However, price increases for most nonagricultural commodities have
turned down or changed little in June and July. The Journal of Commerce
industrial price index fell about 4.4 percent during this period, and the
Commodity Research Bureau index of industrial prices fell 2.2 percent. Prices
for steel scrap, which earlier in the year had been boosted by trade restrictions
and firmer demand, have been flat for more than a month, and copper prices
have fallen more than 9 percent. In contrast, the CRB futures index has risen
almost 1.2 percent since mid-June, boosted by the aforementioned jump in crop
prices.
The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry
workers rose at an annual rate of 4.4 percent over the three months ended in

June, a pick-up of 0.8 percentage point from the previous three-month interval.
This acceleration, when most indicators of labor costs had been trending down
for more than a year, largely reflected a surge in benefit costs last quarter. The
wages and salaries component of the index rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent
in the three months ended in June, only a touch higher than in the previous
three-month period. Taking a somewhat longer view, over the twelve months
ended in June, the ECI for compensation rose 4 percent-the same rate of
increase as in the previous twelve-month period, with a slowdown in wages and
salaries offsetting the acceleration in benefits. Among the major components of
benefits, employer costs for health insurance and workers' compensation picked
up considerably over the past year, while nonproduction bonuses decelerated
sharply.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector (CPH) through midyear
continued the sharp deceleration that had begun in early 2001. In the second
quarter, CPH likely increased 2.9 percent, bringing the four-quarter change to
3.0 percent, considerably less than the increases in the ECI. In constructing its
current-quarter CPH estimate, the BEA supplements the monthly series on
average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers, which has
been rising at roughly a 3.0 percent pace, with judgment based on information
from much more comprehensive but less timely unemployment insurance (UI)
tax records.12 Indeed, the rise in the CPH was well below that in the ECI last
year, a difference that probably reflected a sharp reduction in stock option
exercises (which are included in the UI tax records but not in the ECI).
12. With this annual revision, the BEA implemented a new procedure to estimate private
wages and salaries. Henceforth, the series will remain open to revision for one quarter longer
than the rest of the NIPA accounts so that the BEA can incorporate preliminary data from the UI
tax system. For example, when the final release for 2002:Q2 is published in September, the
BEA will revise its estimate of private wages and salaries in 2002:Q1. It also will revise all
aggregates that depend on private wages and salaries.

Appendix
Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts
The annual revision of the national income and product accounts that was released on
July 31 affected data back to 1999. The revision allows the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) to incorporate more comprehensive source data, including data from
tax records and various annual surveys. Measured in terms of four-quarter percent
changes, the BEA revised down the rate of change of real GDP for each of the three
years: for 1999 by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.3 percent; for 2000 by 0.5 percentage
point, to 2.3 percent; and for 2001 by 0.4 percentage point, to 0.1 percent. On a
quarterly basis, the revised data continue to show a sizable deceleration in real GDP in
2000. However, they also now show that the downturn during 2001 was a bit deeper
and more protracted than in the previous estimates: The cumulative decline in real GDP
during the first three quarters of the year is now 0.6 percent. Even with the revision,
that downturn remains quite mild compared with the average drop of 2.3 percent
recorded during other post-1955 recessions. On balance, the NIPA measures of
inflation were revised little.
Among the components of real GDP, the largest downward adjustments were to
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and to spending on business equipment and
software (E&S). PCE expenditures for brokerage services and for banking services
were both revised down substantially; the revision to brokerage services resulted from
the introduction of a new deflator based on a producer price index, and the revision to
banking services largely reflected updated source data showing individuals holding a
smaller fraction of total bank deposits. Purchases of consumer durable goods,
especially light trucks, were also revised down substantially. That revision as well as
those to the estimates of outlays for E&S were in large part the result of new
information on shipments from the 2000 Annual Survey of Manufactures. The largest
downward revision within E&S was to spending on computers and peripheral products.
Regarding other categories, the BEA revised up its estimates of spending by state and
local governments. Real net exports of goods and services were revised down: Real
exports were revised down, and real imports were revised up.
The downward revisions to real GDP also imply that labor productivity rose less rapidly
in recent years than previously thought. After having incorporated both the new output
estimates and the revised figures on hours released last month by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, we estimate that the revised data to be released on Friday will show that the
cumulative increase in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector over the 1999-
2001 period was 0.7 percentage point smaller. The largest revision to the four-quarter
change in productivity, 0.5 percentage point, will be in 2000. Overall, labor
productivity will continue to show an acceleration from 1.5 percent per year during the
1973-95 period to just under 3 percent in 1999-2000. Last year's cyclical slowdown in
labor productivity will appear more pronounced, but the revised estimates will continue
to show a sharp acceleration in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of this
year.
Gross domestic income was also revised down. Downward revisions to employee
compensation and to corporate profits swamped upward revisions to net interest
income. With income revised down more than product, the statistical discrepancy was

II-A-2
narrowed somewhat. Data from state unemployment insurance wage records led the
BEA to lower by nearly $150 billion its estimate of nominal wages and salaries of
private employees in 2001. But the BEA also boosted personal interest income
significantly in both 2000 and 2001. Taken together, the updated estimates of personal
income and PCE boosted the personal saving rate 1.8 percentage points in 2000 and
0.7 percentage point in 2001.
In a significant change in methodology, the BEA will now use the quarterly
unemployment insurance data, rather than the information from the payroll employment
survey, to estimate the quarterly pattern of wages and salaries.' To accommodate the
timely use of these data, the BEA will now publish revised estimates of wages and
salaries one quarter back when it publishes its final GDP report. The BEA hopes that
the change will help to avoid the large annual revisions to wages and salaries that have
occurred in the past several years.
With this release, the estimate of corporate profits for 1999 is now based on complete
tabulations of corporate tax returns, and the 2000 figure is based on a preliminary
tabulation. Estimates for 2001 continue to reflect the trajectory implied by financial
reports, with some adjustments. Corporate economic profits were revised down in all
three years affected by the revision: $19.4 billion in 1999, $88.3 billion in 2000, and
$35.5 billion in 2001. The figures now show profits to have peaked at the end of 1999
rather than three quarters later. The downward revisions for 2000 and 2001 were
centered in the nonfinancial corporate sector; for 1999, both financial and nonfinancial
corporate profits were revised down. By industry, the largest downward revisions were
in the communications and business services industries. As a result, the profit share as
a percent of GNP (excluding Federal Reserve Banks) was revised down in all three
years as well.
Apparently, a key factor in the profits revisions was the cycle in stock-option expenses.
Because employee gains on stock-option exercises are treated as an expense by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) but not in company financial reports, NIPA profits do
not accurately reflect large swings in exercises until after the IRS data are rolled in. In
2000. skyrocketing option exercises drove down NIPA profits. In last year's
benchmark, the BEA had anticipated some, though apparently not all, of this jump in
option exercises. For 2001, the staff believes that option exercises plummeted, and the
BEA has acknowledged having built into the new estimates an ad hoc adjustment that
boosted its estimates of profits last year. However, if the past is any guide, the
adjustment will probably fall short of the full effect of the decline in option exercises,
which suggests that 2001 NIPA profits could be revised up in next year's benchmark.
1. Because the UI data can be quite volatile from quarter to quarter, the revised changes in
wages and salaries now show larger quarterly fluctuations than do the previous estimates. For
example, the surge in wages and salaries now reported for the first quarter of 2000 likely reflects
a burst of stock-option exercises that quarter, which are measured in the UI data but not in the
average hourly earnings data used previously to interpolate the annual UI estimates. However,
because the BEA does not have a similar indicator series with which to interpolate its quarterly
estimates of profits, the statistical discrepancy has also become more volatile from quarter to
quarter.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Sharp net declines in stock prices and heightened volatility dominated financial
market developments during the intermeeting period. Share values across all
sectors plunged in mid-July amid mounting evidence of accounting scandals and
company warnings about near-term profits. Though equity prices recovered
some in late July, they have fallen again more recently on earnings warnings and
data suggesting that the economic recovery is losing momentum. On balance,
broad stock price indexes are down about 12 percent since the last FOMC
meeting.
The decline in share prices and the weak incoming data led market participants
to mark down their expectations for economic growth and, consequently, their
anticipated path for monetary policy. At the same time, investors have pulled
back from risk-taking in fixed-income markets, with risk spreads for corporate
bonds widening substantially, especially for lower-rated issuers. Although
dealers suggest that the Treasury market functioned well in the intermeeting
period, liquidity in the corporate bond market has reportedly eroded.
Net debt financing by firms was extremely weak in June and July because of
poor market conditions and sluggish demand. In contrast, household borrowing
remains strong and continues to be spurred by low mortgage rates. Treasury
borrowing for the third quarter was revised upward.
Policy Expectations, Stock Prices, and Interest Rates
Neither the FOMC's decision announced after the June 25-26 meeting to leave
the target federal funds rate unchanged and to maintain a balanced assessment of
risks nor the Chairman's monetary policy testimony to the Congress on July 16
and 17 caused much market reaction. In light of lower equity prices and, more
recently, weaker-than-expected economic data, market participants have
dramatically marked down their anticipated path for interest rates. Near-term
federal funds futures contracts suggest that market participants are now fully
pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate by the end of
the year and see some possibility of a move as soon as the August 13 meeting.
The path of the expected funds rate beyond year-end has come down even more,
with implied rates on longer-dated eurodollar futures contracts as much as
130 basis points lower over the intermeeting period.
Taking their cue from stock prices, Treasury yields were volatile and down
markedly on balance over the intermeeting period. Two- and ten-year coupon
yields declined 79 and 44 basis points, respectively, with the yield on the two-
year note touching a historical low. Yields on longer-term Treasury inflation-
indexed securities moved down nearly as much as similarly dated nominal
securities, leaving implied inflation compensation little changed. Dealers report

that trading in the Treasury market remained orderly, although bid-asked spreads
at times widened moderately.
Major equity indexes were at one point down as much as 20 percent during the
intermeeting period, and some touched their lowest levels since the spring of
1997. Stock price volatility surged to its highest reading since the 1987 stock
market crash. While prices have since recouped some of those losses, the
twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 and its spread
relative to real ten-year Treasury yields stand at levels not seen since the mid-
1990s.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell less than those on comparable
Treasuries over the intermeeting period, thereby boosting spreads 25 to 55 basis
points. Soaring yields on junk-rated corporate bonds pushed spreads about 140
basis points wider as concerns about corporate credit quality mounted. Spreads
for telecom and energy firms widened especially, but those for many other
sectors were up as well. Moreover, liquidity in the corporate bond market
appears to have eroded, with bid-asked spreads widening for all credits.
Commercial paper spreads were largely unaffected by the difficulties in the
corporate bond market. Investors in the commercial paper market appeared
unperturbed by the equity and bond market volatility, perhaps because many
firms last year and earlier this year had strengthened their cash positions and
reduced rollover risk by substituting long-term debt for short-term debt;
accordingly, the pace of short-term ratings downgrades has slowed recently.
Business Finance
Most corporate earnings reports for the second quarter met or slightly surpassed
expectations, and S&P 500 earnings are estimated to have exceeded first-quarter
results by 6 percent at a quarterly rate.1 However, those second-quarter earnings
reports that fell short of expectations missed by wide margins, and a number of
firms warned about poorer prospects for the second half of the year. Even
though analysts revised down their forecasts for the third quarter, their
projections remain optimistic and imply that S&P 500 earnings in the third
quarter will exceed second-quarter earnings by 7 percent.
Measures of corporate credit quality continue to show signs of distress.
Moody's downgraded $120 billion of nonfinancial bonds in June and upgraded
1. Four-quarter growth rates in 2002 have been boosted more than 5 percentage points by
the December 2001 change in GAAP that largely eliminated amortization of acquired goodwill.
Second-quarter earnings would have been slightly below year-earlier results without this change.
However, this accounting adjustment barely affects inferences regarding the acceleration in
earnings from the first quarter to the second quarter.

only $4 billion, and net downgrades continued in July. Bond default rates edged
down in June from record highs but surged again in July with the WorldCom
bankruptcy filing, and recovery rates on defaulted speculative-grade bonds
remain at historically low levels. Looking forward, KMV's year-ahead expected
default frequency predicts that default rates will stay elevated for a while.
Net debt financing remained weak in July, as the pace of nonfinancial
investment-grade and high-yield bond issuance slowed dramatically. Investors
have been reluctant to buy bonds because of ongoing concerns about the
reliability of financial statements, perceptions of deteriorating credit quality in
some sectors, and the possibility of additional earnings restatements ahead of the
August 14 deadline for executives to certify their financial statements. Some
nonfinancial firms turned to the commercial paper market to obtain financing,
and the volume of outstanding paper rose in July, its first monthly advance in
2002. However, C&I loans edged down in July on a month-end basis.
According to the August Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the net fraction of
banks that tightened lending standards for business loans over the past three
months was little changed from the April survey, but more banks tightened loan
terms than in the last survey. In addition, a larger net fraction of banks reported
weaker demand for business loans than in the April survey.
Equity issuance in June surged to its highest monthly total in more than a year
on the strength of seasoned equity offerings by telecom and energy firms seeking
to reduce leverage. In July, however, as share prices fell and stock market
volatility soared, equity issuance nearly stalled. IPOs have been especially
weak, and few deals are scheduled for completion in August. Equity retirements
resulting from either cash-financed mergers or share repurchases fell again in the
second quarter. However, retirements are likely to pick up a bit, as
announcements of new share repurchase programs surged in July, spurred by
falling stock prices at firms with excess cash flows.
Commercial Real Estate Finance
The growth of commercial mortgage debt in the second quarter-at roughly a
5 percent annual rate-was down sharply from the pace last year, a decline
reflecting the slowdown in nonresidential construction. Issuance of commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), though somewhat slower than last year's
pace, has been well-maintained in recent months. Delinquency rates on CMBS
have remained stable, after a steep rise in late 2001. CMBS risk spreads traded
within a narrow range.

Household Finance
Home mortgage rates have dipped to levels below those reached last autumn,
and mortgage refinancing activity has surged to yet another record level.
Mortgage borrowing to finance home purchases remains brisk.
Overall, household debt is estimated to have decelerated but still to have grown
fairly rapidly in the second quarter, paced by another sizable increase in
residential mortgage debt and a pickup in the growth of consumer credit.
Although the debt-service burden reversed part of its first-quarter decline,
household delinquency rates have generally changed little on net in recent
months. Signs of stress are mainly confined to subprime borrowers, but lately
these delinquency rates have declined somewhat. On net, the August Senior
Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that demand for consumer loans has been
somewhat weaker than in the April survey.
In the second quarter, steep losses in the equity market showed through to a
sharp drop in the ratio of household assets to disposable income. Households
made record dollar withdrawals from equity mutual funds in July, by more than
would be expected based on historical price declines, and boosted their holdings
of bond and retail money market funds.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The June auction of Treasury two-year notes-originally scheduled for June 26
but postponed to June 28 while the Treasury waited for legislative action to raise
the statutory ceiling on its debt-proceeded without technical problems.2
Issuance of two-year notes remained elevated, and bill issuance has also stayed
strong.
The Treasury borrowed $35.2 billion in July, about 10 percent more than in
June, and announced on July 29 that it expects to borrow $76 billion in
marketable debt during the third quarter, $21 billion more than had been
projected in April. As largely expected, the Treasury indicated in its quarterly
refunding announcement that it will discontinue its practice of re-opening ten-
year notes at every other auction and instead will auction a new ten-year note
each quarter, with the aim of smoothing the maturity distribution of outstanding
bonds.
2. The Congress approved legislation on June 27 to raise the statutory borrowing limit to
$6.4 trillion. The details of the June two-year note offering were originally scheduled to be
released on June 19 for a June 26 auction. Instead, the Treasury both announced and conducted
the auction on June 28. Apparently partly as a result of such short notice, the bid-to-cover ratio
was unusually low, an outcome that evidently boosted the yield on these notes.

III-13
Spreads of agency bellwether debt over comparable Treasuries have been little
changed over the intermeeting period despite somewhat intensified political
debate on the government-sponsored status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On
July 12, Fannie and Freddie announced a voluntary agreement to start registering
their common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
which also commits them to filing financial reports with the commission. Under
the agreement, the agencies' debt and MBS issues will continue to be exempt
from registration, but that exemption is currently being studied jointly by the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the SEC, and the Treasury.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt remained strong in July, though it
slowed from the very swift pace set in June. A fall in yields on net over the
intermeeting period helped fuel both new capital and advance-refunding bonds.
Short-term issuance was also hefty in June and July and suggests that some
states facing fiscal difficulties may have turned to short-term borrowing while
they attempt to fashion long-term solutions to their budget problems. Credit-
rating changes suggest that municipal credit quality has held about steady this
year, after the pace of improvement slowed last year, and yield ratios only edged
up.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 growth was strong in June and picked up to about an 11-1/2 percent annual
pace in July. The strength of M2 growth is attributable to substantial inflows
into retail money market mutual funds that were likely driven, in part, by the
record amount of household transfers from domestic equity mutual funds last
month. In addition, liquid deposit growth likely benefited from the resumption
of mortgage refinancing and from the continued historically low level of the
opportunity cost of holding M2.
Bank credit grew at about a 6-3/4 percent rate in July, up from about 6 percent in
June, reflecting a pickup in securities lending. Loan growth has slowed, as
business loans continued to run off. Home equity lending continued to surge,
and banks' consumer loans grew moderately, abstracting from a large transfer of
credit card loans out of the banking system.
Net income for a sample of large bank holding companies increased
substantially in the second quarter relative to the same period last year. Net
interest income advanced as banks continued to benefit from the relatively less
expensive funding offered by inflows of core deposits, and non-interest income
was boosted by fees associated with credit card and mortgage lending. Loss
provisioning and nonperforming loans increased overall, but several banks
reported that loan quality improved in the second quarter.

While their second-quarter earnings announcements were generally positive,
banks' stock prices did not outperform the broader S&P 500 over the
intermeeting period. In particular, the share prices of JP Morgan Chase and
Citibank fell sharply and hit a low on July 23, reportedly in response to
questions raised about the propriety of the business transacted between those
two large financial institutions and Enron.

August 2002 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
The August 2002 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
focused on changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. In addition, the survey contained three sets of
supplementary questions. The first set addressed banks' exposure to companies that
had released inaccurate or misleading financial information and the banks' response to
these scandals. The second set focused on loans to commercial and industrial firms
that are secured by real estate but used for purposes other than the purchase or
improvement of that property. Finally, the survey asked whether automakers'
incentives were having an effect on demand for automobile loans at banks. Loan
officers representing fifty-seven large domestic banks and twenty-one U.S. branches
and agencies of foreign banks participated in the August survey.
The results indicate some further tightening of standards and terms for loans both to
businesses and to households. The fraction of domestic banks that reported tightening
standards on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the past three months slid a
bit more in August, after having declined substantially in April, but the net fractions of
domestic banks that tightened loan terms jumped again in the latest survey. Significant
fractions of branches and agencies of foreign banks also continued to tighten both
standards and terms in August. In addition, somewhat larger net fractions of domestic
and foreign institutions reported weaker demand for C&I loans in August than had
done so in April. Both domestic banks and foreign institutions tightened standards on
commercial real estate loans over the past three months, and they also reported weaker
demand, on net, for these loans.
In the August survey, most banks reported that they had very little exposure to firms
that have been the target of investigations into their accounting practices. Apart from
the already highly publicized cases, a moderate net fraction of banks indicated that they
had seen an increase in the frequency with which firms had submitted questionable
financial statements during the loan approval process over the past year. In response to
the scandals, most banks reported that they had begun requesting additional financial
detail during the approval process, had increased the frequency or intensity of
monitoring, and were enforcing loan covenants more strictly.
According to the domestic respondents, standards for residential mortgage loans were
largely unchanged over the past three months, and the demand for these loans was
stronger on net. As in April, only a modest portion of domestic banks, on net, reported
tightening standards for consumer loans. Demand for consumer loans was slightly
weaker, on net, over the past three months as banks reported that they lost some
business to automobile finance companies.
Lending to Businesses
The percentage of domestic banks that reported having tightened standards on C&I
loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months edged down to
23 percent from 25 percent in the previous survey, and one bank eased its
standards-the first reported easing since 1999. The percentage tightening standards

III-A-2
on business loans to small firms fell to 9 percent from about 15 percent in April, and
two banks eased standards on these loans.
Conversely, for several of the surveyed terms on loans to large and middle-market
firms, larger fractions of domestic banks reported tightening in August than had done
so in April. The net fraction of domestic banks that had increased costs of credit lines
and raised spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds rose to about 40 percent in
August from about 20 percent in the April survey. Somewhat larger net percentages of
domestic banks also reported that they had tightened loan covenants for these
customers over the past three months than had done so in April. Moreover, almost
50 percent of domestic banks increased premiums charged on riskier loans to large and
middle-market firms, about the same as in the previous two surveys. The net fraction
of domestic banks that increased the costs of credit lines for small firms rose to
22 percent in August from only 8 percent in April. The net fractions of banks that
tightened covenants, increased spreads, and charged higher risk premiums for small
firms also rose somewhat in August relative to the last survey.
The fraction of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that tightened standards
and terms on C&I loans remained in an elevated range. The fraction of foreign
institutions that had tightened standards for customers seeking C&I loans or credit lines
rose to 63 percent in August from about 40 percent in the April survey. From April to
August, the percentage of foreign institutions that increased spreads of loan rates over
their cost of funds rose from about 60 percent to almost 80 percent, and the percentage
that raised premiums on riskier loans also rose, from about 50 percent to almost
80 percent. The fraction of foreign banks that strengthened loan covenants and
increased the cost of credit lines also increased in August.
More than 80 percent of the banking institutions that tightened standards or terms on
C&I loans over the past three months voiced concerns about the economic outlook, up
from 70 percent in the previous survey. Many banks also cited industry-specific
problems and an increase in corporate bond defaults as very important reasons for
tightening lending policies. The fraction of domestic and foreign respondents that cited
reduced tolerance for risk as a reason for tightening their lending policies also
remained high. About 60 percent of domestic banks and nearly all of the foreign
branches and agencies pointed to concern about further revelations of accounting
inaccuracies as at least a somewhat important reason for tightening.
About 45 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for C&I loans
from large and middle-market firms in August, up from about one-third in April. The
net fraction of banks that reported weaker demand from small firms also rose slightly in
August, to 36 percent. The net percentage of foreign branches and agencies reporting
weaker demand for C&I loans over the past three months increased to more than one-
third in the current survey from about 15 percent in April.
All but one domestic bank that experienced weaker demand reported that a decline in
customers' need for bank loans to finance capital expenditures was at least a somewhat
important reason for the weakness in demand, and more than one-third of respondents
chose this reason as "very important." As in the past several surveys, substantial

III-A-3
fractions of banks also reported weaker demand for loans to finance mergers and
acquisitions, inventories, and accounts receivable. Out of five domestic banks that
reported an increase in demand for C&I loans over the past three months, four of them
indicated that the increase was due to a shift in borrowing from other credit sources
that became less attractive. The most frequently cited reasons for weaker demand at
foreign institutions were a decline in requests for merger and acquisition financing and
reduced customer investment in plant and equipment.
Issues related to corporate accounting practices. A series of special questions were
aimed at banks' experience with, and response to, the most recent revelations of
improper corporate accounting practices. Most domestic banks, and about half of
foreign branches and agencies, reported that fewer than 1 percent of their outstanding
C&I loans had been made to companies that had materially changed their prior-period
financial statements during the past year or are the subject of investigations relating to
their accounting practices. However, three large domestic banks and one foreign bank
reported that more than 5 percent of their outstanding C&I loans were to such
companies.
A moderate net fraction of domestic and foreign institutions indicated that they have
seen some increase in the number of companies that submitted misleading financial
information during the past year, and a few domestic banks characterized the increase
as notable. In response, the majority of the banking institutions in the survey have
begun requesting additional financial detail and increasing the frequency or intensity
with which they monitor loans. Many banks also reported that loan covenants have
been enforced more strictly and that loan terms had been tightened. Very few domestic
banks resorted to calling loans or refusing credits that would have previously been
approved, but significant fractions of foreign institutions reported taking such actions.
Banks that had a higher exposure to firms that have been identified as having released
false or misleading financial statements were not significantly more likely to have
instituted remedies (such as requesting additional financial detail) than banks that had
less exposure to those firms. However, banks that indicated that they had seen an
increase in the frequency with which firms submitted questionable financial statements
(apart from the highly publicized incidents) were more likely to have stepped up their
monitoring of loan customers and enforced loan covenants more stringently.
Domestic and foreign institutions reported that regular financial statements received the
highest relative weight when they assessed credit risk. By a wide margin, domestic
banks reported that credit ratings by independent ratings agencies were the second most
important piece of information, on average. In general, domestic banks attached
significantly less weight to market measures such as interest rate spreads on company
debt and equity prices than did foreign banks. About two-thirds of the domestic and
foreign banks surveyed reported that they typically verified that their material business
customers were in compliance with the terms and conditions specified in their loan
contracts on a quarterly basis, and about one-fourth did so monthly.
Commercial real estate lending. The net fraction of domestic banks that reported
tighter standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months declined

III-A-4
further in August, to 25 percent. At branches and agencies of foreign banks, the net
percentage reporting tighter standards on such loans increased slightly, to 30 percent.
In the current survey, more than 30 percent of domestic respondents and 20 percent of
foreign institutions, on net, noted that demand for commercial real estate loans had
weakened, about the same fractions as in April.
A set of special questions addressed banks' exposure to loans that were secured by real
estate and thus were reported as commercial real estate lending but in fact were used
for commercial and industrial purposes. Most foreign institutions and almost 50
percent of domestic banks reported fewer less than 10 percent of their commercial real
estate loans fit this description. About one-fourth of domestic banks reported that 20
percent or more of their commercial real estate loans were used for purposes other than
the acquisition or improvement of real estate. However, only a small net fraction of
domestic respondents reported that such lending had increased over the past year.
Lending to Households
Only three domestic banks reported that they had tightened lending standards on
residential mortgage loans, while one bank reported that it had eased them. On net,
about 27 percent of domestic respondents reported increased demand for residential
mortgages, up from 6 percent in the previous survey. However, the level of mortgage
refinancing has recently been elevated, and the responses to this question are highly
correlated with such activity despite our instructions to include only demand for the
purchase of new or existing homes.
In the current survey, about 15 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had
tightened standards on credit card loans over the past three months, a somewhat larger
percentage than in April. Terms and conditions on credit card accounts were largely
unchanged for the second consecutive survey. For other types of consumer loans,
fewer than 10 percent of banks, on net, reported that they had tightened standards over
the past three months, down from one-fifth of banks in the April survey. In addition,
about 15 percent of domestic banks raised the minimum required credit score and
reduced the number of exceptions granted to customers not meeting credit-scoring
thresholds on these loans.
On net, domestic banks reported that demand for consumer loans was somewhat
weaker over the past three months, perhaps in part because the incentives offered by
major automobile manufacturers and their captive finance companies siphoned
business away from these banks. Indeed, a substantial net fraction of banks reported
that demand for auto loans had decreased somewhat since the automakers began their
latest round of incentives.

The deficit in U.S. international trade in goods and services was $37.6 billion in
May, $1.5 billion larger than in April (revised). For the two months on average,
the trade deficit was $443 billion at an annual rate, $63 billion larger than in the
first quarter as a sharp rise in imports exceeded the jump in exports. NIPA real
net exports weakened an estimated $51 billion in the second quarter.

The value of exported goods and services rose 0.7 percent in May following a
much larger rise in April. The increase in May was primarily in goods, with
small increases recorded in agricultural products, chemicals, and computers. For
April-May combined, the level of total exported goods and services was 3.2
percent (quarterly rate) higher than in the first quarter, led by increases in
automotive parts (primarily to Canada and Mexico), industrial supplies (over
one-third from chemicals, largely price), and capital equipment (items other than
computers and telecommunications equipment, which declined). By area, the
largest increases were to Canada and Mexico. NIPA real exports of goods and
services grew an estimated 11.7 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.
Imports of goods and services rose 1.8 percent in May following a sharp
4.8 percent increase in April. Most of the increase in May was in goods,
particularly automotive products and consumer goods. The value of oil imports
was little changed in May as a drop in quantity was about offset by a rise in
price. For April-May combined, the level of total imported goods and services
was 7.1 percent (quarterly rate) higher than in the first quarter. Increases were

recorded in all major trade categories other than aircraft. There were notable
rises in imports of oil (largely price), automotive products (two-thirds vehicles),
consumer goods, and machinery. About one-third of the increase in imported
machinery was in high-tech goods. Imports of basic industrial and service
machinery rose for the first time in over a year. NIPA real imports of goods and
services jumped an estimated 23.5 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose about 5 percent in July, reversing the
June decline. The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil has
also risen on average since the beginning of the year and is currently trading
around $27 per barrel, up from its average value near $19 per barrel in
December. Factors putting upward pressure on oil prices are low exports from
Iraq, the possibility of U.S. military intervention there, and tighter stock levels in
the United States reflecting increased demand. However, these factors are
somewhat mitigated by decreased compliance by OPEC members to their
production quotas and increasing exports from non-OPEC members, particularly
the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Non-oil imports. The price of imported non-oil goods was unchanged in July
following a small increase in June. The price of core goods was up 0.1 percent,
as prices of both computers and semiconductors fell. The largest increase in
July was in the price index for foods, which reversed its June decline, whereas
prices in other major categories were little changed. The July level of core
goods prices was about 3/4 percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter
level, following an increase of about 1-3/4 percent in the second quarter. The
second-quarter increase was the first quarterly rise in the core goods price index
since the first quarter of 2001. The turnaround is most noticeable in the price of
industrial supplies, which was up 14 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter following three quarters of double-digit declines.
Exports. Prices of total U.S. goods exports rose 0.3 percent in July and the
price of core goods rose 0.4 percent. The largest increase in July was in the
price of agricultural exports, which rose 2.7 percent following an increase of 1.2
percent in June. Prices of industrial supplies and materials also continued to
trend upward in July, whereas prices in other major categories were generally
little changed. The price of core goods in July was about 2-3/4 percent at an
annual rate above the second-quarter level, which was up about 3-1/2 percent from
the first quarter.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net purchases of U.S. securities by private foreigners (line 4 of the Summary of
U.S. International Transactions table) were again quite strong in May and June.
For the first half of the year, notwithstanding tepid inflows in January and
February, net private inflows into U.S. securities totaled $168 billion, on par
with the amount in the second half of last year but somewhat below the $225
billion recorded in the first half of 2001.
Securities inflows picked up between the first and second quarters, as larger
bond purchases more than offset smaller stock purchases. Net purchases of
corporate bonds (line 4c) surged in the quarter, averaging about $20 billion per
month, and net inflows into agency bonds (line 4b) were strong in April and
May before slowing in June. Net inflows into Treasury debt (line 4a) increased
sharply in June, following large net sales in April and balanced flows in May.
After pausing in May, net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks (line 4d) resumed in
June, but inflows for the second quarter were only about half those of the first
quarter.
As noted in the June Greenbook supplement and in a July Board presentation,
the BEA now adjusts financial flows data to account for the TIC system's
probable overestimation of net private foreign purchases of U.S. debt securities
and underestimation of net U.S. purchases of foreign securities. These
adjustments-which reduce published inflows into U.S. bonds by about $25
billion per quarter and increase published outflows through U.S. purchases of
foreign securities by about $7 billion per quarter-are incorporated in the
Summary Table. For the most recent months, for which BOP data are not yet
available, we use adjustments from previous quarters, in order to maintain
comparability through time.
In the second quarter, U.S. residents' net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b)
totaled $20 billion. While this is not an exceptional amount, it is the highest
since the second quarter of last year. However, U.S. residents continued to sell
foreign bonds (line 5a), bringing total outflows through foreign securities (line
5) to only $11 billion for the quarter.
Foreign official reserves held in the United States rose $15 billion in May and
another $29 billion in June (line 1). For the quarter, net foreign official inflows
totaled $47 billion, the largest amount since the first quarter of 1996. Almost
half of the increase in the quarter owed to Japanese accumulation of U.S. assets
associated with its official intervention activity. Russia, Korea, Taiwan,
Norway, and China also substantially increased their foreign official holdings in
the United States in the quarter. Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of

IV-7
New York indicate that total foreign official reserves increased by $12 billion in
July.
Monthly net flows through the U.S. banking sector continued to be volatile, with
substantial net outflows in June offsetting large net inflows in May.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The trade-weighted value of the dollar fluctuated widely over the period but
ended 3/4 percent higher on balance. The dollar rebounded from two-year lows
against the euro and on net, was little changed against the single currency. The
dollar rose 3-3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar. These gains were offset by
declines against other currencies. The dollar depreciated 2-1/4 percent against the
British pound and 1/2 percent against the yen.

May June July Aug
Early in the period, sentiment toward the dollar deteriorated as market
participants questioned the strength of the U.S. economic recovery following
signs of moderating activity and stock market declines. In addition, concerns
about corporate governance and profitability following the bankruptcy of several
U.S. telecommunications companies and further allegations of corporate fraud
contributed to volatility in financial markets. These developments reinforced
concerns about the relative attractiveness of U.S. assets and the ability to finance
the large and growing external deficit, contributing to a sharp decline in the
dollar. By mid-July the value of the dollar as measured by the major currencies
index fell to its lowest level since June 2000. Volatility implied by dollar-yen
and euro-dollar exchange rate options spiked to levels not reached since
September 2001.
Later in the period, the dollar rebounded following some weaker-than-expected
economic data releases abroad. In addition, disappointing European corporate

IV-10
earnings announcements, particularly from insurance companies, weighed on
sentiment toward the euro. As the dollar retraced its initial losses, volatility
implied by dollar-based exchange rate options moderated to more normal levels.
As the yen strengthened early in the period, Japanese officials publicly
confirmed that they intervened on two separate occasions to stem the rise of the
yen.                
            
 
Speculation about the potential impact of U.S. equity declines on global growth
and, by extension, commodity prices appeared to weigh on the Canadian and
Australian dollars. Over the intermeeting period, commodity-linked currencies
depreciated broadly, despite indications of strong domestic demand and
monetary policy tightening. On July 16, the Bank of Canada raised its key
policy rate 25 basis points. The central banks of Norway and New Zealand also
tightened, raising their policy rates 50 basis points and 25 basis points,
respectively.

In contrast, expectations for monetary tightening in Europe have been delayed,
following weaker-than-expected U.S. and European economic data, softer
European inflation data and global stock market declines. In the United

IV-11
Kingdom, December 2002 sterling interest rate futures contracts declined nearly
100 basis points. In the euro area, the comparable rate declined about 65 basis
points, about the same as in the United States.
In addition, on July 26, the Swiss National Bank cut its target range for three-
month Swiss franc LIBOR 50 basis points to 0.25 -1.25 percent, citing slow
growth and its "dissatisfaction" with the persistent strength of the franc, which
may have benefitted from safe-haven inflows. However, gold did not appear to
benefit from its traditional safe-haven status, as its price fell 4-1/4 percent to
$307.80, coinciding with softness in other metals prices and some marking
down of expectations for global economic activity.
Like U.S. markets, foreign equity markets declined amid damped expectations
for global growth and disappointing company-specific news. European share
price declines exceeded those in other major markets, led by plummeting

insurance company shares. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index and the U.K.
FTSE fell between 12 percent and 14 percent, while the S&P 500 index declined
11 percent over the same time period. Asian indexes performed somewhat
better, with the Japanese TOPIX and the Hong Kong Hang Seng falling about
5 percent and 6 percent, respectively.
The dollar's value against the currencies of our other important trading partners
was little changed. Ongoing concerns stemming from the October presidential
election and global financial market pressures weighed on Brazilian assets.
Recent public opinion polls showing the government's candidate Serra falling
further behind and uncertainty about additional IMF assistance pressured
Brazilian assets lower. Despite ongoing official intervention to support the
currency, the real reached its lowest level since its introduction in 1994. The
dollar appreciated 9-1/4 percent against the real. The Brazilian sub-component of
the EMBI+ index rose 420 basis points to slightly above 20 percent. In contrast,
the Mexican peso appreciated about 1 percent against the dollar amid signs of

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Indicators through May and June suggest that economic activity in major foreign
industrial countries continued to firm during the second quarter. However, more recent
surveys of businesses and consumers have shown a dip in sentiment, partly in response
to recent equity price declines. The pace of growth was strongest in Canada and the
United Kingdom, boosted by robust domestic demand, although activity softened notably
late in the quarter. Growth remained sluggish in the euro area and Japan, constrained by
continued weakness in final domestic demand.
Headline and core rates of consumer price inflation generally moved lower. Twelve-
month consumer price inflation in the euro area slipped below the 2 percent target ceiling
of the European Central Bank (ECB), while the United Kingdom registered its lowest
inflation rate since 1975. In Japan, deflation continued, at about a 1 percent rate.
Inflation in Canada, however, edged up.
Robust recovery and concerns about emerging price pressures led several foreign central
banks, notably those of Canada, New Zealand, and Norway, to raise official interest rates
since the last FOMC meeting. In contrast, the Swiss central bank cut official interest
rates in response to the further appreciation of the Swiss franc.
In Japan, indicators suggest that recovery continued in the second quarter, with exports
remaining the predominate source of growth. Industrial production rose 3.6 percent,
boosted by a surge in export orders. The all-industries index was roughly unchanged in
April and May on average from its first-quarter level, held back by weakness in the
services sector. Household expenditures were down about 1 percent during the second
quarter, while new car registrations rose sharply. Capital spending appears to be
stabilizing, with core machinery orders registering gains in April and May.
Nonresidential building starts turned up during the second quarter, following several
quarters of steep declines. Residential building starts were about flat. The trade surplus
widened significantly in May and June, as exports continued to register strong gains.
Labor market conditions remain unfavorable, with the unemployment rate stuck at 5.4
percent in June, only a touch below the record-high rate registered in December. The
job-offers-to-applicants ratio, considered a key leading indicator of employment
conditions, was unchanged in June at 0.53, still well below its recent peak of 0.66 in
December 2000. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh
food but include energy) were down 1 percent from a year earlier in July. Wholesale
prices for domestic goods were roughly flat on a month-to-month basis between
February and June, but continued to be down on a twelve-month basis.

The Bank of Japan's Tankan index of business conditions improved in June, led by large
manufacturers who are benefitting from a strengthening of foreign demand. This
represents the first quarterly gain in business confidence since late 2000. Nonetheless,
the level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment among firms of all sizes
and across all industries remains very low, at -32 in June versus -41 in March. Survey
respondents project a further improvement in the index, to -29, for September.
Sentiment among large manufacturers registered the largest quarterly improvement since
1976, while firms across other categories also reported some improvement in conditions.
Survey expectations of profits and sales were generally revised up, although projections
for investment spending remained weak.
Progress towards structural reform remains slow, largely because of bureaucratic and
political opposition. In July, the Diet passed several bills establishing a public
corporation to take over the services of the postal system in April 2003 and allowing
entry by private firms into the mail delivery business. However, the bills were heavily

IV-15
watered down before being approved and have large loopholes that significantly weaken
the impact they will have on opening up the postal services to greater competition.
Financial system reform also remains slow, with press reports suggesting that the
government may postpone the removal of the blanket guarantee for non-interest bearing
bank deposits, which was expected to take place in April 2003.
Recent data suggest that economic recovery in the euro area remains somewhat
tentative. Euro-area industrial production rose only marginally in May, and for April
and May on average output remained slightly below the first-quarter average. Strikes in
Germany and Italy in part accounted for the reduced output. German manufacturing
orders surged in May but reversed that gain in June. For May and June on average
foreign orders rose moderately, while domestic orders declined, consistent with domestic
demand that is weak in Germany relative to the other euro-area countries. Euro-area
business and consumer sentiment lost some ground in June and July, as confidence was
hurt in part by recent equity price declines.
Labor market data for the euro area as a whole show limited deterioration, as the
harmonized unemployment rate has edged up from a low of 8.0 percent last fall to 8.4
percent in June, still well below the average rates of above 10 percent in the late 1990s.
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation moved below the ECB's
target ceiling of 2 percent in June for the first time in two years, and the flash estimate of
July inflation remained just below 2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, the
twelve-month inflation rate dipped to 2.4 percent in June from 2.5 percent in May.
Producer prices remain below year-earlier levels.
On July 25, Portugal announced that its 2001 budget deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP,
above the 3 percent limit that could trigger European Union sanctions. The European
Commission said that it would start sanctions proceedings against Portugal by preparing
a report and making a recommendation to the European Council on whether there is an
excessive deficit, taking into account extenuating factors. The Council will vote on this
finding and recommend actions that Portugal should take to bring its deficit back into
line. Ultimately sanctions could be imposed, possibly including fines. Portugal would
be the first country to be sanctioned for an excessive deficit.

In the United Kingdom, real GDP jumped 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter,
according to the preliminary estimate. This figure is likely to be revised down
significantly, however, when recently released industrial production data are
incorporated. Industrial production dropped 4.3 percent in June, partly reflecting fewer
working days during that month owing to Golden Jubilee celebrations. Growth in the
services sector is estimated to have strengthened from less than 1 percent in the first
quarter to about 2.4 percent in the second quarter.
Indicators for the third quarter suggest a possible slowdown in growth. The
manufacturing PMI dropped notably in July, indicating contraction for the first time in
five months, and the services PMI also declined. Surveys suggest retail

sales in July were flat, while consumer confidence was unchanged in July from the
month before.
The twelve-month increase in housing prices hit a thirteen-year high at around 21
percent in July. However, there are signs that the housing market may be coming off the
boil. Borrowing to finance the purchase of new homes fell almost 17 percent in June
from May's record high and anecdotal evidence suggests that the purchase of homes for
rental has slowed. Moreover, growth in consumer credit slowed further in June after
hitting a record high in April.
Labor market conditions remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate
remained at 3.2 percent in June, near a record low. Even so, the twelve-month rate of
retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) dropped in June to 1.5
percent, the lowest inflation rate since the series began in 1975. The twelve-month
growth rate of average earnings remained at 4 percent in May.

In its August Inflation Report, the Bank of England lowered its growth forecast for 2003
from 3 percent to 2.5 percent, and lowered its inflation forecast, now predicting that
inflation will remain below the 2.5 percent target over the two-year forecast horizon.
The report added that risks to growth are "to the downside."
In Canada, indicators for the second quarter have been strong, although most of the
strength occurred early in the quarter. Real GDP by industry increased 10.5 percent
(s.a.a.r.) in April, led by a sharp climb in the level of manufacturing. In May, however,
growth was flat. On average, GDP by industry in April and May rose 4.5 percent
compared with the first-quarter level.
Motor vehicle production exhibited particular strength in April, with shipments soaring
14.4 percent from the previous month. Forestry production also grew robustly, as
Canadian producers rushed to take advantage of a temporary elimination of U.S. duties
on Canadian softwood lumber exports. The duties, both countervailing and anti-
dumping, were suspended from April 21 to May 22 for technical reasons relating to U.S.
trade law. Output of both industries retreated from April's elevated levels in May, but
average levels remain above first-quarter levels.
Retail sales increased at a brisk pace in April, but fell back in May with clothing sales
recording the largest decline. Consumer confidence was roughly flat in the second
quarter, after a large increase in the first quarter pushed the index to a level not seen
since 1988. Business confidence moved up in the second quarter, again after recording a
large jump in the first quarter.
The unemployment rate decreased to 7.5 percent in June. Employment has grown 2
percent over the first half of 2002, the largest six-month gain since 1988. The twelve-
month rate of consumer price inflation in June rose to 1.3 percent from 1.0 percent in
May, with most of the increase attributable to a rise in cigarette prices. The twelve-
month rate of core price inflation, excluding food and energy prices, rose to 2.6 percent
in June from 2.4 percent in May.
The Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate, its key policy rate, 25
basis points to 2.75 percent on July 16, citing stronger-than-expected Canadian growth.
Overall, the Bank of Canada has now taken back 75 basis points of the easing cycle that
began in 2001 and encompassed a cumulative reduction of 375 basis points.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In South America, economic and financial conditions have deteriorated significantly over
the intermeeting period. As the presidential election nears in Brazil, market concern
over the policies of the future government has caused the value of the real to plunge and
spreads to soar. In Uruguay, the situation has reached crisis levels; on August 5, the U.S.
Treasury responded by providing a $1.5 billion loan from the Exchange Stabilization
Fund as a bridge to forthcoming funds from the International Financial Institutions. The
loans are intended to shore up Uruguay's weakened banking system. Prior to receiving
the loan, the Central Bank had imposed a four-day bank holiday in response to sustained
deposit outflows. Uruguay's level of international reserves has plunged over the past
month, and the currency has depreciated substantially since being allowed to float in
mid-June.
The economic environment is more positive in Mexico, where a recovery appears to be
taking hold, and in developing Asia, where the recovery across most of the region has
strengthened on the back of more robust export growth.
Elsewhere, economic data in Turkey have been positive, but financial conditions have
weakened considerably. Concern over the prime minister's health has continued, leading
elections to be advanced to November 3. Turkey is expected to receive its August IMF
disbursement, but political uncertainty has led market participants to question the
country's ability to meet its performance criteria and service its considerable debt.
Economic activity in Brazil has weakened since the last Greenbook as financial market
sentiment toward the country worsened sharply. The real depreciated significantly over
the intermeeting period and spreads on foreign-currency denominated sovereign debt
continued to rise. Industrial production declined 5 percent in May, leaving it about
unchanged from a year ago, and the unemployment rate was nearly 8 percent in June, up
over 1 percentage point from its year-earlier level. Weak domestic demand has
contributed to an improvement in the trade balance. Twelve-month inflation was
7.7 percent in June, exceeding the 5-1/2 percent upper limit of the government's inflation
target range for 2002. Acknowledging the likely effect of the depreciating real on prices,
the Brazilian government shifted and widened its inflation target band for 2003 from 1-1/4
-5 1/4 percent to 1-1/2 -6-1/2 percent in late June.
Brazil's serious problems have been fueled by the presidential election on October 6
(with a runoff on October 29 likely) and fears that the new government, entering office in
January 2003, may take unilateral action with respect to the domestic and foreign debt
and reverse the current administration's economic policy reforms. Left-wing candidates
Luiz Inacio "Lula" da Silva and Ciro Gomes are leading in the polls, while the
government's candidate, Jose Serra, is running a distant third. The fallout from the
electoral campaign is causing spreads in secondary markets to widen sharply and is

IV-24
undermining the government's ability to conduct its normal auctions of domestic debt.
Since late June, the government has acted to shorten the maturity profile of the domestic
debt, largely in order to support prices of bonds held by banks and mutual funds, which
hold 80 percent of the government's debt.
In an effort to support markets, the central bank reduced the overnight interest rate from
18-1/2 percent to 18 percent in late July. Recent attempts to bolster the currency through
pre-announced sales of international reserves ($50 million per day) have not been
successful. Brazil is currently holding talks with the IMF to enlarge and extend its
program beyond the mid-December expiration date. The Cardoso government is also
attempting to gain a degree of assurance from the presidential candidates that they would
adhere to the IMF program if elected.

In Argentina, data for June signaled some stabilization in economic activity. Industrial
production and real retail sales rose 1 to 2 percent in June, although both remain about
10 percent below their year-earlier levels. Earlier, real GDP declined nearly 22 percent
in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.), driven by plunging domestic demand. The unemployment
rate stood at over 21 percent in May. Monthly consumer price inflation in July was
about 3 percent, bringing the twelve-month increase to 33 percent. Driven by the
collapse of the peso, producer prices rose nearly 90 percent over the same period.
Discussions between the IMF and the Argentine government on an economic adjustment
program have continued, and a repayment of IMF funds due in July was postponed a

IV-25
year. The peso stabilized in July, supported in part by central bank intervention and a
rise in short-term interest rates to over 100 percent. Disagreements over the course of
monetary and banking policy between the economy ministry and the central bank
(BCRA) led to the departure of BCRA President Mario Blejer in late June. His
replacement, Aldo Pignanelli, soon clashed with the Economy Minister, Roberto
Lavagna, in part over the voluntary nature of the ministry's plan for an exchange of
frozen bank deposits for long-term government bonds. In the event, only a quarter of the
trapped deposits were exchanged, leaving the banking system still vulnerable to deposit
outflows as the deposit freeze continues to be challenged in the courts. As a result of the
government's inability to tackle the country's economic problems, the next presidential
election was moved up six months to March 2003. Former president Menem, several
Peronist governors, and a few left-wing politicians have indicated intentions to run.

Mexico's recent indicators are consistent with economic recovery. The April-May
averages for overall economic activity (a monthly proxy for real GDP) and industrial
production were both up roughly 1-3/4 percent from their first-quarter levels. Exports have
rebounded, rising 3-1/2 percent (s.a.) in the second quarter from the previous period.
Imports have grown even more rapidly, consistent with a revival of domestic demand,
and the trade deficit has widened accordingly.
The pass-through to prices of the substantial depreciation of the Mexican peso in recent
months has been limited; twelve-month consumer price inflation increased about 1/4
percentage point to nearly 5 percent in June, and even that was partly accounted for by a
rise in domestic fruit and vegetable prices. In late July, the Bank of Mexico (BOM)
made official its informal target of 3 percent for year-end, twelve-month inflation for
2003 and signaled its intention to keep price increases to 3 percent beyond 2003. The
BOM also introduced a band of plus or minus 1 percentage point around its inflation
target. June's inflation was within the target range for 2002 implied by the new band.

In Venezuela, political uncertainty continued to punish an already weakened economy.
The unemployment rate jumped to almost 16 percent in April. Anecdotal reports were of
even higher unemployment figures later in the second quarter. The bolivar has
depreciated 40 percent since floating in mid-February. Weak demand appears to be
muting the pass-through of this devaluation into consumer prices: CPI inflation was
22 percent in the twelve months ended July. Poor tax receipts and reduced oil
revenues-as oil production has declined in line with OPEC quotas-have led to a serious
budget imbalance while political instability has virtually cut off government access to
international and domestic capital markets.

The Korean economy performed well over the intermeeting period. An election day
holiday, strikes in the auto industry, and focus on the World Cup held down industrial
production in June. For the second quarter as a whole, however, production was up over
2 percent from the previous quarter, with strong gains in the semiconductor industry.
The trade balance recorded a $14.6 billion surplus in the second quarter, down a bit from
the first quarter as export growth was tempered and import growth picked up. The
unemployment rate has been roughly stable in recent months, and consumer price
inflation in July remained on the low side of the central bank's 2 to 4 percent target
range.

Recent indicators from the ASEAN region point to a continuation of the strong recovery
begun late last year. Industrial production is up, on average in the second quarter so far,
in every country in the region. Production of high-tech goods has been the driving force
behind the overall increase in most of the region. Because most high-tech goods are
exported, exports in the region have also increased in recent months. Given the high
import content of the region's exports, imports have risen as well, and the net effect on
trade balances has been mixed.
Since the last Greenbook, inflation declined further in Indonesia, largely due to the
rupiah's appreciation during the first half of the year. In Singapore, consumer prices in
June were up on a twelve-month basis, the first positive inflation reading since late last
year. In the rest of the region, inflation has remained stable, with twelve-month inflation
below 3 percent in each case.

The Chinese economy continued to grow at a rapid pace in the second quarter, with real
GDP rising more than 9 percent (s.a.a.r.). Chinese officials pointed to strong growth in
exports and foreign direct investment as being primarily responsible. Foreign direct
investment in the first half of the year was over 30 percent greater than its level the same
period last year, while exports were almost 15 percent above last year's level. The
overall trade surplus, which surged in the first quarter, remained well above last year's
level in the second quarter. The rate of deflation has moderated somewhat since the last
Greenbook, partly due to the acceleration of economic activity.

In Hong Kong, indicators since the last Greenbook point to further economic weakness.
Unemployment rose again in the second quarter. The trade deficit widened in recent
months, exceeding $10 billion in May and June, largely due to a significant increase in
imports from China that are destined for re-export. However, the overall volume of
trade that Hong Kong handles is well below earlier levels, as China's entry into WTO
has led many traders to bypass Hong Kong and deal directly with China. In addition,
twelve-month deflation worsened in May and June, reflecting a resumption of property
price declines and the poor economic environment more generally.

Economic conditions in Taiwan strengthened further in the second quarter. Industrial
production rose over 6 percent (s.a.) in the quarter but was down more than 5 percent in
June, as electronics production fell off from an historical high. Prices have also
stabilized, after falling much of last year. Exports continued to rise in recent months, led
by exports of high-tech goods. Imports also increased, reflecting both the high-import
content of exports and the recovery in the economy more broadly.
