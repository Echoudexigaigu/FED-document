Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The pace of the economic expansion appears to have picked up substantially.
Consumer spending and the demand for housing were quite strong in the third
quarter, and business outlays for capital equipment appear to have accelerated.
Meanwhile, activity in the labor market seems to be leveling out, and industrial
production has firmed in recent months. Core consumer prices have risen
somewhat faster over the past several months than they did earlier in the year;
even so, the twelve-month change in core CPI prices was only 1.2 percent in
September, a full percentage point less than the increase during the preceding
year.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market appears to be stabilizing. Total nonfarm payrolls rose 57,000
in September, and the July and August declines in employment now are
estimated to have been smaller than previously reported.' The average
workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers held steady last month at
August's upward-revised level of 33.7 hours. Aggregate hours of production
workers were unchanged in September, although hours for the third quarter as a
whole were nearly 1 percent (annual rate) below those for the second quarter.2
Private payroll employment climbed 72,000 in September, the first increase
since January. The largest gain was in professional and business services, which
added 66,000 jobs in September-half of them at temporary help supply firms.
Employment also increased in most other major industries in September. Key
exceptions were manufacturing and the related wholesale trade industry,
although even in these sectors, the pace of job loss (29,000 and 5,000
respectively) was somewhat slower than in previous months. Government
employment fell 15,000 in September as a large cutback in local education more
than offset gains at the federal and state level and elsewhere in local
government.
In the household survey, the unemployment rate in September was unchanged at
6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate ticked down further, to
66.1 percent. The number of job losers unemployed less than five weeks as a
percent of household employment moved down for the fourth month in a row,
but the number of individuals unemployed more than twenty-six weeks as a
1. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to the
level of payroll employment in March 2003 is a downward revision of 145,000, or 0.1 percent-
small relative to the average absolute revision of 0.3 percent over the preceding ten years.
2. However, because of a sharp rise in hours of the self-employed, total hours of all persons
in the nonfarm business sector will likely show an increase in the third quarter.

~

percent of the labor force edged up. These figures suggest that layoffs are
continuing to subside but that hiring remains depressed.
This interpretation of the labor market is reinforced by other data. The four-
week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has declined
a bit recently, reaching 391,000 in the week ending October 11. Similarly,
layoff announcements, as tracked by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray,
and Christmas, Inc., remain well below the level in the first half of the year.
However, the four-week moving average of insured unemployment has changed
little since early August, and the proportion of unemployment insurance
recipients who exhausted their benefits remained elevated in September.
Moreover, household perceptions of job availability, as reported in the
Conference Board survey, deteriorated further in September and now stand at
their lowest level since December 1993.
In contrast, a large fraction of firms participating in the Manpower survey
declared plans to boost hiring in the fourth quarter, although the net margin
remains well below its first-quarter level.³ And, despite a downtick in
September, the third-quarter average of the volatile survey on small business
hiring plans, reported by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, is
near the upper end of the range of the past few years.
Industrial Production
Conditions in the industrial sector have improved somewhat in recent months.
Industrial production posted a noticeable increase of 0.4 percent in September.
Although much of the strength in output last month reflected a jump in motor
vehicle assemblies, manufacturing output excluding motor vehicles and parts
still moved up 0.2 percent.4 For the third quarter as a whole, industrial
production expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, and capacity utilization
turned up after having reached a twenty-year low in the second quarter.
Production gains have apparently become more widespread across industries in
the third quarter, as the diffusion index of three-month percent changes in IP has
now registered above 50 three months in a row.
Increased production of high-tech goods contributed 1.3 percentage points to the
overall change in IP in the third quarter. In particular, the production of
semiconductors advanced at an annual rate of more than 50 percent, the fastest
quarterly increase in this category since the second quarter of 2000. The recent
3. Manpower participants reported the fourth-quarter hiring plans as of the third quarter. In
terms of their usefulness in predicting employment changes, we believe these reported plans
actually pertain to the remainder of the third quarter following the survey and to October.
4. According to our industry contacts, production in a few industries, such as motor vehicles
and steel, was briefly affected by Hurricane Isabel; nonetheless, most of the lost production
appears to have been made up within the month.

acceleration has been concentrated in high-value microprocessors. Elsewhere in
the high-tech sector, the third-quarter increase in computer production, at an
annual rate of just over 20 percent, was about even with the average gain in the
first half of the year. A pickup in demand for mobile computing equipment
accounted for much of the strength in overall PC shipments. In contrast, the
output of communications equipment, which has continued to founder, fell at an
annual rate of nearly 5 percent.
Forward-looking indicators for the high-tech sector have been, on balance,
positive: Intel's latest revenue projections are consistent with another
noticeable rise in semiconductor production in the fourth quarter. The latest
projections by Gartner call for PC shipments to rise modestly in the fourth
quarter, although shipments of servers are expected to decrease. New orders
for communications equipment have stabilized, and a diffusion index of future
spending on data-networking equipment (such as routers, switches, and hubs),
compiled by CIO Magazine, moved up in August and September. However,
anecdotal reports from our business contacts indicate that industry conditions
are still mixed. In addition, days' supply for communications equipment, as
measured by the staff's flow-of-goods system, remains elevated, a factor that
may hinder production for a while longer.
In the energy sector, electricity generation pulled back in September, when
temperatures returned to more normal levels after an unusually hot July and
August. In contrast, the production of manufactured energy goods and oil and
gas extraction posted solid gains-the result, in part, of a response to the sharp
rise in energy prices over the same period.
Among the various IP market groups excluding energy, high-tech, and motor
vehicles and parts, most categories registered output gains in September.
Prod uction of consumer nondurable goods edged up after having fallen in the
previous two months, as did the output of business supplies. Production of
business equipment was held down, in part, by continued declines in the output
of commercial aircraft; Boeing recently announced further reductions in its
planned assemblies, a move that suggests that the level of production in this
category will remain tepid through early next year. The production of defense
and space equipment registered another outsized gain in September.
Construction supplies dropped back, but for the quarter as a whole, output in
this category was up a bit from the average level recorded in the second quarter.
The forward-looking indicators of near-term production suggest that the recent
expansion in activity in the industrial sector will continue in coming months.
For example, the ISM index of new orders moved up in September to its highest
level in nine months, and the index of order backlogs was at its highest level in
more than a year. The various diffusion indexes of new orders published by the

regional Federal Reserve Banks, some of which are available through October,
have been similarly upbeat. Furthermore, although the staffs series for real
adjusted durable goods orders declined in August, a three-month moving
average of this volatile series suggests that, on balance, orders have improved
modestly over the past few months. On the downside, data on import and export
shares indicate that the net trade position for manufacturing outside of motor
vehicles has shown little improvement as yet in response to the decline in the
exchange value of the dollar since early 2002.
Motor Vehicles
After having surged in August, sales of autos and light trucks receded to an
annual rate of 16.6 million units in September. For the third quarter as a whole,
sales of light vehicles averaged 17.5 million units (annual rate), up 1-1/2 million
units from the average sales pace over the first half the year. During the
summer, consumer demand for vehicles probably was boosted by the sharp
increase in sales incentives in July and August. The tax cuts that became
effective at mid-year may also have played a role. Incentives fell back a bit in
September and slid still further in early October. Nevertheless, according to the
Michigan survey, consumer car-buying attitudes moved back up in early
October to a very positive level. In contrast, business demand for light vehicle

fleets edged lower in the third quarter, to 3.1 million units, a sales rate a bit
below the average in 2002.5
Total motor vehicle production jumped sharply to an annual rate of 13 million
units in September. For the third quarter as a whole, production was at a
12.3 million unit rate, up from 11.7 million units in the second quarter. The
supply of light vehicles held in inventory averaged sixty-two days in the third
quarter, down from averages of well over seventy days during the first half of
the year. The industry currently expects sales in the fourth quarter to average
below their high third-quarter pace, and production is scheduled to drop back to
an 11.9 million unit pace.
The UAW union recently ratified four-year agreements with the Big Three and
parts suppliers Delphi and Visteon.6 According to industry reports, a key
objective for the UAW was to make the Big Three more competitive and
preserve union jobs, and in pursuit of this objective, the union was prepared to
make some concessions on compensation and plant closings. The membership
of the UAW has fallen from its 1979 peak of 1.5 million to less than 640,000 in
2002.7
Under the new contracts, workers immediately receive a $3,000 signing bonus
and will get another bonus equal to 3 percent of their wages in the second year.
They will receive a 2 percent base-wage increase in the third year and a
3 percent increase in the fourth year.8 The UAW estimates that union members
will see their base wages, including COLAs, rise an average of 2-3/4 percent in
each year of the agreement.9 Retirement benefits were little changed, as was the
health care package, which is provided free of charge to employees. For the Big
Three, the costs per vehicle of providing health and retirement benefits to their

in PCE. In recent years, the Big Three have favored incentive programs that encourage
consumers to purchase their vehicles rather than lease them. In the 1990s, the Big Three
supported vehicle sales with lucrative lease deals, which later turned out to be unprofitable.
According to data from J. D. Power and Associates through September of this year, the share of
leases in motor vehicle sales has averaged about 12 percent, down from an average of almost
30 percent in 2000.
6. The UAW's official name is the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural
Implement Workers of America.
7. In recent years, the UAW has been able to offset its steep losses in manufacturing to a
small extent by successfully organizing some employees in the service sector.
8. Workers will continue to receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) every three months,
but the amount of the COLA will be reduced by 2 cents each quarter. In the 1999 agreement,
workers received a 3 percent base-wage increase in each year of the agreement in addition to the
COLA. They also received a $1,350 signing bonus.
9. The UAW reports that an average union-represented assembler earns $25.60 an hour and
has an average annual salary of $70,200 per year.

Consumer Spending
Real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen back in
September after having surged in July and August." This pattern largely
reflects a swing in consumer purchases of motor vehicles, which reversed their
July-August run-up last month. However, apart from motor vehicles, outlays
also rose at a solid pace in August and appear to have declined only slightly in
September. Spending has been supported of late by the sizable boost to
disposable personal income from the recently enacted tax cuts as well as by
levels of wealth and confidence that are considerably above their values earlier
this year.
In September, nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which excludes
automotive dealers and building materials and supply stores, ticked up
0.1 percent after having posted a robust 1.3 percent in August. Factoring in the
effect of rising gasoline prices, we estimate that real retail control fell
0.1 percent in September after having jumped 0.8 percent in August. For the
third quarter as a whole, real retail control skyrocketed at an annual rate of
9.8 percent.
Real outlays for services rose modestly in August, the most recent month for
which official estimates are available. The increase was driven by a rise in
spending for energy services. Expenditures for other services, which continued
to advance at a lackluster pace, were held back, in part, by continued weakness
in travel and recreation spending.
Real disposable income advanced 0.6 percent (at a monthly rate) in August after
having jumped 1.3 percent in July, with both increases reflecting sizable
reductions in tax payments. Real pre-tax income was essentially unchanged in
both months.
The early October rise in the Michigan Survey Research Center's index of
consumer sentiment just offset the decline in September. The Conference Board
measure of consumer sentiment also fell some in September. These measures of
confidence have changed little, on balance, in recent months and stand well
above their March lows.
10. For example, Prudential Securities estimates that GM spends $1,360 per vehicle on
health and retirement benefits, Ford spends $734, and Chrysler $631; the comparable figures for
Toyota and Honda are $180 and $107, respectively.
11. The September decrease does not appear to be attributable to Hurricane Isabel, which
likely had negligible effects on aggregate consumer spending.

Housing Markets
Housing construction and sales remained very strong in August and September
even though mortgage rates were above the extremely low levels briefly reached
at the beginning of the summer. In the single-family sector, new homes were
started at an annual rate of 1.52 million units in September, only slightly below
the blistering pace seen in June and July.12 Permit issuance-adjusted for
activity in areas where permits are not required-was roughly in line with starts
in September, and the backlog of unused permits moved up, suggesting that
starts will remain robust in coming months.
Sales of existing homes spiked to an annual rate of 6.47 million units in August,
the fastest pace on record. In addition, sales of new homes moved back up in
August to a level only a bit below June's record-setting rate. Taken together,
these figures imply that commissions paid to real-estate brokers-a component
of residential spending-were robust in the third quarter.
Between June and August, the rate on fixed-rate mortgages moved up more than
100 basis points, while the rate on one-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs)
increased only 30 basis points. As a result, the share of new mortgage
originations going to ARMs rose sharply in August, to 20 percent. This shift
may have tempered the effect of rising rates on housing activity.
In the multifamily sector, starts rose to an annual rate of 368,000 units in
September, the highest pace since August 2002. The ratio of permits to starts
was well below its historical level, suggesting that multifamily starts will be
reduced in coming months.
Recent indicators signal a robust pace of housing activity going into the fourth
quarter. Since August, rates on both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages have
reversed part of the run-up of earlier in the summer. Consumer sentiment
toward homebuying, as measured by the Michigan Survey, improved noticeably
in early October to a level just a bit below its recent high in May. In addition,
the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage applications for the
purchase of a home (as opposed to refinancing) moved down only slightly in the
middle of October from its recent high.
The most recent data on house prices show that the median price for existing
homes sold in August was 9-3/4 percent higher than during August 2002, up
from a 5-1/4 percent increase during the preceding twelve months. In contrast,
the repeat-sales price index for existing homes, which partially adjusts for shifts
12. Hurricane Isabel appears to have had little effect on housing starts in September. In
addition, using the aftermath of the significantly more destructive Hurricane Andrew as a guide,
we expect that replacement and repair spending in the wake of Isabel will have only a minor
effect on overall construction outlays.

in the composition of homes sold, has shown a marked deceleration since early
2001. This suggests that the acceleration of the unadjusted figures reflects
compositional shifts rather than a genuine acceleration in house values. The
median price of new homes sold in August was up about 3 percent from the
previous August, the same increase as recorded during the year-earlier period.
Quality-adjusted new home prices rose 3-3/4 percent during the year ending in
the second quarter, compared with a 3-1/4 percent increase during the preceding
year.
Equipment and Software
Real outlays for equipment and software in the third quarter appear to have
advanced faster than the 8-1/4 percent annual rate recorded in the second
quarter. Business purchases of motor vehicles moved up a good bit in the third
quarter, while aircraft expenditures declined. The apparently strong third-
quarter increases in spending aside from that on transportation equipment are
consistent with the continued gains in business output and corporate cash flow
as well as the low user cost of capital.
In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computing equipment dropped
10 percent (monthly rate) in August-not quite enough to reverse the July
increase-and shipments of communications equipment receded a bit. But with
prices for these goods falling, total real high-tech spending likely posted a
sizable gain in the third quarter as a whole. Outside of the high-tech sector,
shipments weakened in August, with small declines in most subcategories; still,
a solid showing in July put this category on track for a moderate third-quarter
increase. Looking forward, new orders for computers and peripherals have
moved up in line with shipments, and bookings for communications equipment
appear to have stabilized, albeit at a low level. While new orders apart from
high-tech edged down in August, they have increased, on balance, since the
beginning of the year-a development that suggests ongoing spending gains in
this category.
Outlays in the transportation sector appear to have risen in the third quarter,
spurred importantly by stronger sales of medium and heavy (class 8) trucks.
Part of the increase in business demand for these vehicles over the past two
quarters likely reflects the effects of partial expensing. In addition, sales of
heavy trucks this year have been supported by a string of incentive programs
from manufacturers; the removal of incentives in July likely contributed to the
subsequent softening in orders for these vehicles. Meanwhile, domestic
shipments and imports of aircraft moved down significantly in August from
elevated levels in July.
Nonresidential Construction
Spending on nonresidential construction appears to be bottoming out. After
having fallen 25 percent from October 2000 to August 2002, nominal outlays

for the construction of privately owned buildings were about flat, on net, during
the twelve months ending in August. However, there are few signs so far of a
sustained pickup in this sector.13
The recent sideways pattern of overall construction spending masks the
disparate performance of its principal components. Nominal spending on office
space continued to decline in August; office rents fell again in the second
quarter, and although vacancy rates edged down slightly in the third quarter,
they remained at a very high level. In contrast, outlays for the construction of
other commercial buildings (such as those for retail and wholesale
establishments) have moved higher in recent months despite falling rents
through at least the second quarter.14 Spending on private institutional buildings
(such as schools, churches, and hospitals) has continued its strong uptrend.
Among the smaller subsectors of nonresidential construction, spending on
industrial buildings continued to be very weak in August, and vacancy rates
moved up again in the third quarter. Outlays for hotels and motels also
remained depressed in August, although anecdotes suggest that spending in this
sector may be reaching a trough. The increase in drilling and mining activity
through October implies that outlays for drilling and mining structures are likely
to increase further this fall, albeit at a slower pace than seen in the second
quarter.
Business Inventories
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor
vehicles dropped in August after having edged down in July. Manufacturers ran
off stocks at a fairly rapid clip in both months, while wholesalers and retailers,
excluding motor vehicles and parts dealers, recorded small declines in stocks in
August after accumulations in July. Generally small changes in shipments and
sales in the July-August period have kept book-value inventory-sales ratios
about flat.
Days' supply for total IP in the flow-of-goods system edged up in September
but remained below the average level recorded in the second quarter. Excluding
motor vehicles and parts, the inventory-consumption ratio edged down to a
record low. Among the various industries, only paper, communications
13. Again, with the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew as a guide, we do not expect that
reconstruction following Hurricane Isabel will make a significant contribution to overall
nonresidential construction spending. Indeed, a portion of the repair work may be classified as
an intermediate good (like repairs to business equipment) and therefore would not be reflected in
the spending figures.
14. Prices for office and other commercial buildings moved higher in the second quarter
despite declines in rents, perhaps because favorable financing conditions helped reduce the cost
of owning a building. Still, weak rents could threaten recovery in these sectors.

Federal Government Sector
Spending resulting from the U.S. presence in Iraq and income tax cuts enacted
under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act continue to put
upward pressure on the federal unified budget deficit. The deficit for fiscal
2003 was $374 billion, up substantially from the deficit of $158 billion recorded
in the previous year. Limited progress is being made on the budget for fiscal
2004, and the federal government is operating on a continuing resolution that
provides funding through the end of October.
Federal receipts, totaled over August and September, fell almost 4 percent from
their corresponding year-earlier level owing to the effects of the tax legislation
enacted in late May. The decline in individual income and payroll taxes over
the two months reflects the new withholding tables, reduced quarterly
declarations, and the two waves of child-credit refund checks that were mailed
out in early August. On balance, corporate receipts edged up over the two-
month period relative to a year earlier despite provisions of the tax legislation
that both delayed about $5 billion of September payments to October 1 and held
down taxes by allowing partial expensing of certain investments.
Outlays, adjusted for financial transactions and payment-timing shifts, rose
about 8 percent in the August-September period from the year-earlier level.
Apart from interest payments, which fell, increases were widespread, led by a
sizable rise in both defense and Medicaid outlays.
On the legislative front, only three of the thirteen regular appropriations bills for
fiscal 2004 have been enacted into law. The House and Senate have passed
supplemental appropriations bills to fund activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
House-passed bill provides $66 billion for added defense spending and
$21 billion in aid for reconstruction. The Senate version is similar, but it
converts a portion of the aid to Iraq into a loan.
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of spending by state and local governments have been mixed so far in
the third quarter. As of September, employment had fallen in almost every
month since its high last February, with a cumulative drop of more than
100,000. The cutbacks have been spread nearly equally between state
governments and local governments and between education and non-educational
functions. Until September, the local education sector had not shown much
deterioration in employment. But September was the start of the 2003-04
academic year in most school districts, and last month's employment decline
probably reflected more recent budget decisions to cut education spending by
many governments that had previously hoped to spare education. Meanwhile,

construction spending ticked up in August after having risen during most of the
spring and summer months, and the average level in July and August stood
1.8 percent above the average seen in the second quarter.
State legislatures are currently not considering fiscal issues, and lawmakers in
most states appear to be taking a break from addressing the budgetary pressures
that were pervasive last spring. Many seem to be hoping that a stronger
underlying economy will bring receipts and spending into better alignment this
year. Most states begin their next legislative sessions in January.
Prices and Labor Costs
Boosted by a run-up in gasoline prices, the consumer price index rose
0.3 percent in September. A sharp increase in energy prices over the preceding
year pushed up the September twelve-month change in the CPI to 2.3 percent,
compared with 1.5 percent a year earlier.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased 0.1 percent in September after a
similar increase in August. Core consumer prices have risen somewhat faster
over the past several months than they did earlier in the year when core inflation
was depressed by a number of transitory factors. As of September, the twelve-
month change in the core CPI stood at 1.2 percent, well below the
2.2 percent increase recorded during the comparable period a year earlier. The
index for core goods fell again last month and was 2.4 percent below its level a
year earlier, the largest twelve-month decline in more than fifty years. Core
services prices rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar increase in August.
Faced with continuing budget problems, many states raised university tuition
sharply for the current school year and thereby pushed up the CPI for education
services during the summer. Even so, prices of non-energy services as a whole
decelerated 0.9 percentage point over the twelve months ending in September.
Core PCE prices edged up 0.1 percent in August. Over the twelve months
ending in August, core PCE prices increased 1.3 percent; the rise was
1.7 percent during the comparable year-earlier period. The 0.4 percentage point
deceleration in core PCE inflation between the two periods is noticeably less
than the 1.0 percentage point deceleration in the core CPI over the same period.
The difference between the two inflation measures is attributable in part to an
appreciable acceleration in the prices of PCE items that are not included in the
CPI and for which no market-based prices exist. The market-based component
of the core PCE price index decelerated 3/4 percentage point over the twelve
months ending in August, to a 0.7 percent rate of increase. The core portion of
the chained CPI, like PCE prices, uses a superlative aggregation formula to
account for substitution by consumers in response to changes in relative prices;
core chained CPI also rose 0.7 percent over the twelve months ending in
September, down 1.0 percentage point from the previous twelve-month period.

II-31
Consumer energy prices moved up 3.0 percent in September on the heels of a
gain of 2.7 percent in August. These increases reflected low inventories of
gasoline in August and a gasoline pipeline breakdown in Phoenix, which pushed
wholesale and retail gasoline prices sharply higher through late August.
Gasoline inventories moved up to normal levels in September, and markups
reverted to their historical values by the first week of October; nonetheless, the
arithmetic of monthly averaging led to a large increase in the gasoline CPI in
September and implies a substantial decline in the gasoline CPI for October.
Earlier in the year, extremely tight inventories of natural gas and heating oil
heightened concerns about possible shortfalls in the coming winter heating
season. However, supplies of natural gas have since risen to normal levels
because of both higher production and temperate weather. Total distillate fuel
oil inventories have also returned to normal levels in recent months, but the
heating oil component of distillate inventories remains below normal, especially
in New England, the big consuming region for heating oil.
The CPI for food rose 0.2 percent in September, with pronounced increases for
prices of beef and pork. Livestock prices have been pushed up by a ban on
imports of live cattle from Canada, where a case of mad cow disease was
identified this past spring.
The PPI for capital equipment edged down in September but was still
0.6 percent above its level of a year earlier. Prices for core intermediate
materials rose 0.1 percent and were up 1.7 percent from a year earlier-an
acceleration relative to the previous twelve-month period that, to a large extent,
reflects sizable price increases for energy-intensive products. The major
indexes of spot commodity prices have moved higher since the September
Greenbook. The Journal of Commerce industrial price index has increased
5.8 percent, in part because of a pickup in prices for metals, crude oil, cotton,
and plywood. The Commodity Research Bureau's spot industrial commodity
price index, which excludes energy and forest products, has increased
9.2 percent.
Like consumer price inflation, most broad measures of total price inflation have
been boosted over the past year by accelerating energy prices, while broad
measures of core price inflation have generally moved a bit lower. In particular,
the four-quarter change in the GDP price index excluding food and energy was
1.3 percent in the second quarter, 0.2 percentage point below the pace recorded
a year earlier.
According to the Michigan Survey, median year-ahead expected inflation fell
back in early October to 2.4 percent, close to the average for the second and
third quarters. Median expected consumer price inflation over the next five to
ten years ticked up, to 2.8 percent, remaining in the narrow range that has

prevailed over the past two years. In September, the Philadelphia Fed published
the most recent quarterly survey of professional forecasters' long-term inflation
expectations, which remained unchanged at 2.5 percent.
We have received relatively little information about labor costs since the
previous Greenbook. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory
workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged down 0.1 percent in September, to a
level 2.7 percent above a year earlier. That twelve-month increase was
0.2 percentage point less than during the previous twelve-month period and
more than 1/2 percentage point below the pre-recession peak.
On benefits, the Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Benefits conducted
annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and
Educational Trust (HRET) showed that health insurance premiums increased
nearly 14 percent, on average, between the spring of 2002 and the spring of
2003. The Kaiser/HRET survey also indicated that health insurance costs rose
sharply for both employers and workers, with the share of premiums paid by
covered workers holding virtually steady at 27 percent (for a family policy) in
2003. For 2004, premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
are expected to rise 10-1/2 percent, the fourth consecutive double-digit increase.
Also, Towers Perrin has released some preliminary results from its survey for
2004, which show health insurance premiums increasing an average of
11 percent for active workers.

Appendix
The Household and Payroll Measures of Employment
Each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes two independent estimates
of employment. The payroll employment measure is based on a survey of
establishments conducted as part of the Current Employment Statistics program, and the
household measure of employment is based on a survey of households called the
Current Population Survey. The payroll survey estimates the number of employees on
nonfarm payrolls based on a sample of about 400,000 establishments that account for
about one-third of total nonfarm payroll employment. Each year, the payroll
employment estimates are benchmarked to a near-universe count of payroll
employment that is taken in March of the previous year from unemployment insurance
tax records and other administrative data. In contrast, the household survey estimates
the number of persons with a job by interviewing approximately 60,000 households.
The household survey figures are inflated by monthly estimates of the population to
generate estimates of national employment and unemployment. Although the raw
household survey data are not revised, the population estimates used to inflate them are
occasionally updated to incorporate new information from decennial censuses and new
estimates of immigration.
The two measures differ importantly in concept. First, the payroll survey tallies jobs,
whereas the household survey counts the number of individuals with a job. Thus, a
person who holds multiple jobs at different establishments would appear more than
once in the payroll survey but only once in the household survey. In addition to
covering wage and salary workers on nonfarm payrolls, the household survey's measure
of employment includes unincorporated self-employed individuals, workers in private
households, unpaid family workers, workers on unpaid absences, and farm employees,
all of whom are excluded from the payroll records of nonfarm establishments. At the
same time, the payroll survey includes wage and salary workers under the age of 16;
these workers are excluded from the household survey.
The BLS has made major changes to both employment surveys over the past decade.
Over the past several years, the payroll survey methodology has shifted from an
archaic, quota-sampling procedure to a probability sample of establishments. In 1994, a
major redesign of the household survey sharpened the clarity of its questions and
improved the interviewing techniques used in the survey. In addition, the household
survey adopted the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for its
industrial and occupational classifications in January 2003; the payroll survey estimates
were converted to NAICS in June 2003. How such changes may have altered the
comparability of the two measures of employment or their cyclical characteristics is not
known.
Reconciling the Levels of the Two Employment Measures
Each month, the Board's staff adjusts household employment to the concept underlying
the payroll survey insofar as the available data allow (table). We also incorporate
estimates of the updates to the population controls over the historical period to which

II-A-2
they apply.¹ Although these adjustments, on net, reduce the level of household
employment and narrow the discrepancy in the levels of the reported series, the
difference remains large (chart 1).
Over time, the discrepancy between the adjusted household measure and the payroll
measure has had two components: one secular and one cyclical. The secular component
has tended to expand as monthly household estimates progressively extend beyond the
most recent update to Census population controls. Indeed, before the incorporation (in
January 2003) of the new controls for the 2000 decennial Census and the annual update
to the population estimates for immigration, the average monthly discrepancy was
around 4.1 million. The updates to the population estimates eliminated about
60 percent of that gap.
Regarding cyclical behavior, the payroll series has historically been more pro-cyclical
than the adjusted household series. In the past, the inability of the payroll survey to
adequately capture births and deaths of establishments as they occurred contributed to
its cyclical pattern during the periods between annual benchmarks. But even after
benchmarking, it remained more pro-cyclical than the household measure, and
researchers have not been fully able to explain why this is so. Among the possible
explanations is an increase during periods of weak labor markets in work "off the
books" of establishments, which might cushion the reported decline in household
employment relative to the payroll measure. Another contributing factor may be related
to the procedures for dealing with persons who do not respond to the household survey
either because they refuse to participate or because the interviewers cannot reach them.
Those procedures assume that the labor force characteristics of the nonrespondents are
the same as those for persons in a similar demographic group who are interviewed. If
those missed tend to be marginal workers who are less likely to be employed during
weak labor markets and more likely to hold jobs when employment is expanding, the
procedures would dampen the cyclicality of household employment. Finally, the
expanded use of multiweek pay periods may result in workers appearing on the payrolls
of more than one establishment, and thus as employed more than once in the payroll
survey- particularly when hiring is robust and workers are changing jobs more often.
Such job changers would be counted as employed at only one job in the household
survey, which measures labor force activity during a single reference week during the
month.
Another unresolved issue in reconciling the two employment measures is an apparent
break in the level of the gap between the two series. That break seems to coincide with
the introduction of the new household survey in 1994. Before 1994, the discrepancy
between the adjusted household series and the payroll series tended to fluctuate widely
but averaged close to zero; since then, the gap, while still seemingly cyclical, has been
persistently negative-that is, the level of the adjusted household series has been below
that of the payroll series.
1. The BLS typically does not revise its historical data to reflect updates to the population
controls; this omission can result in a noticeable break in the official time series, as it did in
January 2003.

II-A-3
Differences in Employment Changes Indicated by the Two Measures
More recently, attention has focused not on the levels of the two measures but on their
divergent signals of the change in employment. For example, between the most recent
recession trough (November 2001) and September 2003, the payroll survey showed a
decline of roughly 1 million jobs, while the official household survey indicated a rise of
1 million; the increase in our adjusted household series was even larger--1-1/4 million.2
That said, the labor market by either measure has been very weak during the past
twenty-two months-with employment even somewhat weaker than during the
recovery from the 1990-91 recession and much weaker than in earlier economic
expansions (chart 2).
Two upcoming revisions to the series are likely to change those estimates, and whether
they will, on net, narrow the difference between the two is unclear. First, the BLS
recently reported that its preliminary tabulations of employment from first-quarter
unemployment insurance tax records imply a downward revision of approximately
145,000 in the level of payroll employment for March 2003; those revisions are
scheduled for release with the preliminary estimates for January 2004. Taken alone,
that change would increase the discrepancy between the changes indicated by the two
employment measures. However, at the same time, the household survey figures will
be adjusted to new population controls that incorporate information on immigration in
the period since 2000. Because we believe that immigration has slowed recently, we
anticipate that the upcoming adjustment may lower the estimate of the population and
of its future rate of change and, thus, result in a lower reported level of household
employment. The magnitude of this change is uncertain, but assuming that it goes in
the direction that we anticipate, it also would tend to reduce the recent increase in
household employment over the period since the recession trough.
The Two Surveys as Economic Indicators
Each of the two surveys has strengths and weaknesses as an indicator of economic
activity. The principal advantage of the household survey is that it provides a broader
view of employment than does the payroll survey. However, measurement of many of
the components of household survey employment that are missing from the payroll
concept may be subject to greater nonsampling reporting error than the components that
the two surveys have in common. In addition, unlike the payroll estimates, the monthly
estimates from the household survey are not revised, and the sampling variation of the
household survey is noticeable. The approximate standard error for the month-to-
month change in household employment is 177,000.³ By comparison, before its recent
major redesign, the root mean squared error of the month-to-month change in payroll
employment was about 65,000. Finally, as noted earlier, the household survey
2. Changes in employment over shorter periods also diverge widely. In September 2003, the
adjusted household survey was down 847,000 from its year-earlier level while payroll
employment was 427,000 lower-a difference of 420,00. In June, the adjusted household
figures showed an increase of 780,000 from a year earlier while payroll employment was
estimated to have fallen 480,000-a difference of more than I million.
3. Information on the statistical characteristics of the two surveys is routinely available in an
appendix, "Explanatory Notes and Estimates of Error," to the monthly Employment and
Earnings volume published by the BLS.

II-A-4
questionnaire was redesigned in 1994. Although researchers have developed a good
understanding of how to bridge the old and new series, we do not know to what extent
the cyclical properties of the household measures of labor market activity may have
changed.
On balance, the Board's staff has found the payroll survey to be the more reliable
indicator of current economic activity, although it also has a number of disadvantages
as a current indicator. For example, the monthly revisions to the preliminary estimates
of payroll employment have tended to be pro-cyclical. And, as noted earlier, before the
recent redesign of the sample, preliminary payroll survey estimates were subject to
large and systematic benchmark revisions. Before the changeover to the new sample,
benchmark revisions to payroll employment were generally positively correlated with
both the change in payroll employment and with whether it was accelerating or
decelerating. They also tended to be positively serially correlated. Thus, the upcoming
March 2003 adjustment of -145,000 is not necessarily surprising because payroll
employment was declining, on balance, over the period from March 2002 to March
2003.4 The recent statistical improvements in the payroll survey were, in part, intended
to improve its ability to estimate employment between benchmarks; whether the
redesign will, over time, alter these earlier systematic patterns is unclear.
We also found that benchmark revisions to the change in payroll employment were not
correlated with changes in household employment when information on initial claims
for unemployment insurance was used to control for the stage of the business cycle. In
a recent report to the House Budget Committee, John Kitchen reports the opposite
result.5 However, because he did not control for the stage of the business cycle and
included only early stages of recoveries in his sample, we believe that he may be
picking up a spurious correlation in which the less-cyclically-sensitive household
survey may be acting as a proxy for the stage of the cycle. He also did not adjust, as we
do in our empirical work, for the discontinuities in the household survey when new
population controls are introduced.
4. The March 2003 revision will be small by historical standards--0.1 percent compared
with an average absolute revision of 0.3 percent over the preceding ten years.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Generally favorable economic data and earnings news contributed to a more
optimistic tone in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Investors
marked up the expected path for policy, and Treasury and high-grade private
yields rose. Signs of strengthening economic activity led to an appreciable
narrowing of risk spreads, pushing down borrowing costs for many mid- to
lower-tier corporate credits. In addition, equity prices were buoyed by third-
quarter profits that generally beat analysts' expectations.
Corporate bond issuance stepped up in September, but the runoff of short-term
debt continued, leaving overall business borrowing lackluster. Household
borrowing has held up well despite a notable drop-off in mortgage refinancing
activity. Federal borrowing has continued at a brisk pace, driven by elevated
military expenditures and sluggish tax revenues. In addition, state and local
governments continued to issue substantial amounts of debt to finance capital
projects.
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields
Investors marked up the expected path for policy substantially over the period,
largely on a string of better-than-expected economic releases in October as well
as on comments by Federal Reserve officials that led investors to anticipate an
earlier onset of policy tightening. Current money market futures quotes suggest
that market participants are confident that the FOMC will not change policy at
its October meeting. Futures quotes further out on the curve imply that investors
now place considerable odds on a quarter-point tightening by the middle of next
year. Consistent with the upward revision in policy expectations, nominal
Treasury coupon yields rose about 10 to 25 basis points. Market-based
measures of inflation compensation increased about as much as nominal yields,
although survey-based measures of inflation expectations were little changed.
Stock Prices and Corporate Yields
Broad equity price indexes rose about 3 percent over the intermeeting period,
with many touching new highs for the year. Market volatility was low, and
options prices indicated that investors expect volatility to remain subdued.
Technology-sector stock prices outpaced the broader market, keeping the
forward price-earnings ratio for this sector well above the P-E ratios for nontech
firms. The forward-earnings yield on the entire S&P 500 continued to hover at
about 5-3/4 percent, and its gap over the real Treasury yield remained steady as
well. This measure of the equity premium falls squarely within its range prior to
the run-up in stock prices in the late 1990s.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose slightly less than yields on
longer-dated Treasuries, leaving risk spreads for these securities a touch lower.

Yields on speculative-grade bonds further extended their recent declines,
slipping about another 50 basis points and significantly narrowing their spreads
against Treasuries.
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality
To date, reports on third-quarter S&P 500 earnings suggest that profits increased
markedly, far surpassing analysts' already optimistic forecasts, on balance.
Seasonally adjusted earnings per share are estimated to have jumped roughly
10 percent at a quarterly rate from the second quarter. Overall, guidance for the
fourth quarter has also been favorable, even if somewhat cautious, and earnings
forecasts for 2003 and 2004 inched higher in September and October.
On the basis of dividend announcements thus far, the annual indicated dividend
per share of the S&P 500 has risen more than 10 percent since the end of 2002.
Although some of the increases likely reflect a response to the dividend tax cut,
the breadth of the advance may be a sign of the corporate sector's growing
confidence in a sustained profit recovery. Announcements of new share
repurchase programs also jumped in the third quarter, but are running a bit
below the previous year's pace.
Bond rating downgrades ofnonfinancial corporations remained modest in
September and were almost matched by upgrades, a substantial improvement
from the first half of this year. The trailing six-month bond default rate
remained at around 1 percent. The forecast of aggregate year-ahead default
probability, however, continued to fall as broad equity prices improved
moderately and market volatility declined.
Business Finance
Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations bounced back in September after a
lull in July and August. The pickup was especially pronounced in the
investment-grade sector, but speculative-grade issuance was also robust. With
much of the proceeds from bond offerings earmarked to retire other debt, short-
and intermediate-term credit once again was paid down, as reflected in the
contractions in both commercial paper and C&I loans. However, the most
recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated
that this weakening in C&I loan demand may be diminishing. For the third
quarter as a whole, total net debt financing appears to have run at a roughly zero
rate as strong earnings and a buildup of cash assets from strong borrowing
earlier this year may have reduced the demand for funds. However, data for the
first half of October suggest that net debt financing has risen a bit.
Presumably supported by stock price increases this summer, gross issuance of
public equity by nonfinancial firms totaled $6-1/2 billion in September, the

strongest monthly showing in more than a year. IPOs increased, reflecting
greater willingness of investors to fund risky ventures. Seasoned offerings were
robust and came from a variety of industries, although apparently a large chunk
of the proceeds was earmarked to pay down debt. Cash-financed mergers
inched higher in the third quarter, and net equity issuance is estimated to have
remained marginally negative.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial mortgage debt expanded in the third quarter at an estimated
8 percent rate, down slightly from its second quarter pace. In the commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market, rates fell slightly on net over the
intermeeting period, and incoming data suggests a slight increase in CMBS
issuance. CMBS credit spreads remain narrow, consistent with the low level of
mortgage delinquency rates overall. However, BBB-rated CMBS continued to
trade at a yield premium to BBB-rated corporate debt, reflecting some concern
among investors about commercial real estate fundamentals and the rapid pace
of CMBS issuance.
Household Finance
Interest rates on both adjustable-rate and thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages fell on
net over the intermeeting period. However, the declines produced only an
uptick in refinancing applications, as rates remain well above their lows in mid-
June. With a slight rise in purchase originations offsetting some of the decline
in refinancing activity, home mortgage debt growth is estimated to have slowed
to a still-brisk 11 percent annual rate in the third quarter.
Consumer credit grew at an estimated annual rate of 5 percent in the third
quarter, up slightly from the pace in the second quarter. This modest
acceleration in consumer credit occurred even though some households may
have used their tax rebates to pay down consumer debt.
Consumer credit quality appears to have improved slightly in recent months.
Delinquency rates on consumer loans and home mortgages at commercial banks
fell in the second quarter, and those on auto loans at the captive finance
companies remained at low levels in August. Household bankruptcy filings are
estimated to have remained stable in October, albeit at elevated levels.
Although the growth of house prices is estimated to have moderated somewhat
over the third quarter, sizable stock price gains produced a substantial increase
in household net worth. At the same time, though, tax cuts boosted households'
disposable income, so that the ratio of net worth to disposable income was about

uunchanged in the third quarter. In September, households continued to shift
assets out of corporate bond funds and into equity funds, although the flows into
equity funds were not as large as they had been in August.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross municipal bond issuance has maintained a fairly robust pace in the third
quarter, as municipalities continued to borrow for both short-term cash needs
and long-term capital projects. However, the run-up in municipal yields in
recent months has contributed to a dwindling volume of advance refunding
issues.
Downgrades of municipal issues picked up a bit in recent weeks and included a
five-notch downgrade to junk status of nearly $900 million in Pittsburgh general
obligation bonds. Because the bonds are insured, prices were mostly
unaffected, but the city has cancelled plans to issue new debt, and market reports
suggested that this may be a sign of financing problems for other cities. More
broadly, risk spreads for municipal revenue bonds, which have climbed of late,
have hit a five-year high.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury borrowed less in the third quarter than it had projected at the
August mid-quarter refunding, in part because of both a smaller-than-expected
budget deficit over that period and a larger-than-projected drawdown of its cash
balances.
The G-7 statement in mid-September raised some concerns that foreign official
institutions would reduce their holdings of Treasury securities. However, such
concerns were quieted after investors noted that indirect bidding at Treasury
auctions, which includes bidding by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on
behalf of foreign monetary authorities, had not fallen off sharply.
The Congress continued to consider legislation that would affect the regulatory
oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, although it seems unlikely that such
legislation will be passed this year. Share prices of the two GSEs rose and
agency yield spreads narrowed a bit over the intermeeting period.
Several of the Federal Home Loan Banks announced notable losses over the
intermeeting period, prompting the Administration and some members of the
Congress to consider including these institutions under a new regulatory
framework. Despite the losses, spreads of yields on Federal Home Loan Bank
bonds over those on comparable Treasury securities moved up only a few basis
points.

Money and Bank Credit
M2 declined at about a 5 percent rate in September after having grown briskly in
July and August. During previous months, M2 growth had been pushed up as
funds related to MBS prepayments were temporarily placed in short-term
deposit accounts. As the volume of refinancings diminished, this process was
reversed and liquid deposits declined. M3 also declined in September, although
not as quickly as M2.
Bank credit decreased at a 5.6 percent rate in September after having grown
sluggishly during the two preceding months.' The ongoing reduction in banks'
holdings of mortgage-backed securities has been a significant factor. C&I
lending contracted more rapidly in September than in August, probably in part
because of resurgent bond issuance. Weakness in C&I lending remained
confined to large domestic banks and branches and agencies of foreign banks as
business lending at small banks continued to expand.
1. Data on C&I loans presented in the Greenbook have been adjusted to remove the
estimated effects of the adoption by some banks of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation 46 (FIN 46). This accounting change, which was issued in January, had
originally required institutions to consolidate some variable interest entities into their balance
sheets in the third quarter. During the intermeeting period, however, FASB announced that
institutions could delay implementation of the new accounting treatment until the fourth quarter,
reducing its effect for now.

Appendix
October 2003 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
The October 2003 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months. In addition, the survey contained a
supplementary question on potential demand for commercial and industrial (C&I)
loans, a series of questions on banks' participation in the secondary market for C&I
loans, and a question on loans secured by real estate but used for purposes other than
the acquisition or improvement of real estate. Responses were received from fifty-six
domestic and twenty-one foreign banking institutions.
Almost all domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks indicated
that lending standards were about unchanged over the past three months for all types of
loans. In addition, for the second consecutive survey, small net fractions of domestic
banks reported easing spreads on C&I loans and on credit card loans. Banks that eased
lending conditions on C&I loans frequently reported doing so in response to increased
competition from nonbank lenders.
On the demand side, also for the second consecutive survey, the net fraction of banks
that reported weaker demand for C&I loans declined, to less than 15 percent for
borrowers of all sizes. Demand for commercial real estate loans at domestic banks
weakened at about the same pace as in the previous survey (August 2003). Meanwhile,
respondents indicated that demand for mortgage loans to purchase homes declined over
the past three months, the first reported weakness in two years.' Demand for consumer
loans, however, reportedly continued to strengthen, though at a less rapid pace than in
August.
The large majority of domestic banks with assets of more than $20 billion and U.S.
branches and agencies of foreign banks reported selling their adversely rated loans in
the secondary loan market over the past two years. Domestic banks indicated that the
most important reason for doing so was to reduce the level of risk in their C&I loan
portfolios as a whole, while foreign institutions ranked reducing their exposure to
individual borrowers highest. Investment banks and other nonbank financial
institutions were reportedly the primary purchasers of adversely rated loans.
Lending to Businesses
In the October survey, domestic banks, on net, reported that lending standards on C&I
loans for firms of all sizes were about unchanged. In contrast, a small percentage had
tightened standards on those loans in the August survey. However, the largest domestic
banks in the sample-those with assets of more than $20 billion-eased their lending
standards, on net, over the past three months. A small net fraction of U.S. branches and

question, historically there has been fairly high correlation between responses to this question
and the volume of mortgage refinancing.

agencies of foreign banks also eased lending standards, including one foreign bank that
reported it had eased standards "considerably."
For the second consecutive survey, modest net fractions of domestic banks reported
reducing the spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds for borrowers of all sizes.
Domestic banks also reported easing terms on credit lines for larger borrowers, with
11 percent of respondents, on net, increasing the maximum size of credit lines and
5 percent, on net, reducing the cost of these lines. As with standards, the easing of
terms generally occurred at the largest banks in the sample, while smaller banks
continued to tighten most terms, on net. This movement reverses the pattern on
surveys between the middle of 2000 and the end of 2002, in which the largest banks
had been more likely than other banks to report tightening standards and terms.
Foreign institutions, on net, reported no change in spreads on loans or in the cost or
size of credit lines. As in August, however, moderate net fractions of domestic and
foreign institutions increased the risk premiums charged on loans to their riskiest
borrowers, and small fractions tightened collateral requirements.
Nearly 70 percent of the domestic banks that reported tightening standards and terms
on C&I loans continued to report a reduced tolerance for risk as an important reason for
doing so. Nearly 80 percent of the domestic and foreign banks that tightened lending
standards or terms indicated that concern about the economic outlook was at least a
somewhat important reason for tightening; but a similar percentage of the institutions
that eased standards or terms cited an improved economic outlook as a reason for doing
so. Moreover, although the percentages of banking institutions tightening standards
and terms that cited concern about the economic outlook and industry-specific
problems were higher than in August, they represented a much smaller number of
banks because fewer institutions reported tightening standards and terms. Increased
competition from other banks or nonbanks was cited by all of the foreign banks that
eased lending conditions and about 80 percent of the domestic banks that did so.
The October survey indicates that the deterioration in demand from commercial
borrowers has slowed and shows signs of stabilizing. Although 12 percent of domestic
banks, on net, reported that demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market
borrowers had weakened over the previous three months, that percentage is down
significantly from the 22 percent that reported weaker loan demand in August and from
the 40 percent that had reported weaker demand in April. In the current survey, only
4 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand from small firms,
whereas 12 percent, on net, had reported weaker demand in August. About 20 percent
of domestic respondents and 35 percent of the largest banks, on net, indicated that
inquiries from potential business borrowers had increased, up from only 10 percent and
20 percent, respectively, in August. U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks
reported no change in demand, on net, over the past three months, and 24 percent of
these institutions, on net, indicated that the flow of inquiries from potential customers
had picked up.
On net, banks continued to cite reduced investment in plant and equipment as the most
important reason for weaker demand for C&I loans. A small net percentage of banks
reported that demand for credit to finance inventories and accounts receivable had

III-A-3
decreased. Several respondents said that demand for C&I loans had risen in part
because borrowing had shifted to their bank from other credit sources; however, other
domestic and foreign banks indicated that increased competition had reduced demand
at their institutions. Demand for loans to finance mergers and acquisitions, which had
previously been a frequently cited reason for weaker demand, was reported to have
nearly stabilized, on net, in October.
The secondary market for C&I loans. Most of the domestic survey respondents with
assets of more than $20 billion and nearly all of the U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks indicated that they had sold adversely rated loans (those rated as special
mention or classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss) in the secondary market at some
time during the past two years. Almost 20 percent of the largest banks indicated that
they sold more than 10 percent of those loans, while about 55 percent of all domestic
banks that participated in the secondary market sold less than 5 percent of their
adversely rated loans. Foreign institutions used the secondary market to reduce their
exposure to these credits somewhat more aggressively: About one-third had sold more
than 10 percent of their problem credits.
The most important reasons domestic banks gave for selling adversely rated loans were
to trim the overall credit risk of their portfolio and to reduce exposure to particular
firms. On average, domestic banks ranked the price that they obtained in the secondary
market relative to their perception of the loan's value as a less important motive for
selling than reducing credit risk. By contrast, foreign institutions on average ranked the
attractiveness of the price as a close second to reducing exposure to particular firms.
Investment banks purchased about 50 percent of the adversely rated loans sold by
domestic banks and more than 40 percent of those sold by U.S. branches and agencies
of foreign banks. Nearly 25 percent of the adversely rated credits sold by domestic
banks, and 30 percent of such loans at foreign banks, were bought by nonbank financial
institutions, such as hedge funds and distressed debt funds, or other private investors.
About 15 percent of the adversely rated loans sold by domestic banks reportedly went
to other U.S. commercial banks, and about the same percentage of those loans sold by
foreign banks were said to have been purchased by U.S. commercial banks. Among
domestic banks that sold a significant share-more than 10 percent--of their adversely
rated loans on the secondary market, purchasers were mainly investment banks,
distressed-loan funds, or private venture groups.
Banks were also asked to indicate the shares of any loans (adversely rated or other) that
they sold at specified ratios of the secondary market price to face value. As industry
reports also indicate, the distressed market was very important for banking institutions
that wanted to unload deteriorating credits. Domestic banks reported that, on average,
almost 35 percent of loan sales were at 75 percent or less of face value and about
50 percent of the loans were sold for 85 percent or less. At foreign banks, the shares
were 31 percent and 47 percent respectively. About 25 percent of the loans sold by
domestic banks and 34 percent of the loans sold by foreign banks, on average, were
sold at between 95 percent and 100 percent of par, and a small percentage of loans
were sold above par.

III-A-4
A much smaller fraction of domestic banks-about 25 percent-reported that they had
purchased loans in the secondary market, and those that did tended to purchase only
loans that were trading above 90 percent of their face value. Foreign institutions were
much more active purchasers of loans, though they too tended to buy only loans trading
above 90 percent of face value.
Commercial real estate lending. Domestic banks reported that standards on
commercial real estate loans were about unchanged, on net, over the past three months;
the response ended a long period in which they had continuously tightened standards.
One foreign bank reported easing standards on these loans. Demand for commercial
real estate loans continued to erode at domestic banks, with 11 percent, on net,
reporting a decline in demand in the October survey, about the same as in August,
while at foreign institutions demand was unchanged. On net, 6 percent of domestic
banks reported that there had been a slight increase over the past year in the volume of
loans to commercial and industrial firms secured by real estate but used for purposes
other than the acquisition or improvement of real estate. Thus, increases in such loans
have apparently not contributed significantly to the decline in C&I loans over the same
period, at least at respondent banks.
Lending to Households
Demand for mortgages to purchase homes reportedly weakened over the past three
months. On net, 21 percent of domestic banks reported weaker demand for residential
mortgage loans, whereas in August, 45 percent of banks had reported increased demand
for mortgages. However, banks may find it hard to separate mortgage originations used
to buy homes from those used to refinance existing mortgages. Concurrently, banks
reported no change, on net, in lending standards on residential mortgages, little
changed from the August survey.
Fifteen percent of banks, on net, indicated that they were more willing to make
consumer loans in the current survey, about the same share as in August. As is
consistent with this report, only one bank tightened standards on credit card loans and,
as had been the case in the past two surveys, a small net fraction of banks reported
easing spreads on credit card loans. No banks tightened standards on other types of
consumer loans, but about 8 percent reported increasing spreads on those loans.
However, 10 percent of banks increased the minimum credit score required to obtain a
credit card loan, and 4 percent did so for other types of consumer loans. In addition,
about 20 percent of respondents indicated that they had reduced the extent to which
they were willing to grant credit card loans to individuals who did not meet credit
scoring thresholds, while 12 percent of domestic banks had done so for other types of
consumer loans. About 4 percent of respondents, on net, indicated an increase in
demand, compared with an unusually large 30 percent that had reported stronger
demand in the August survey.

The value of exports of goods and services fell 2.7 percent in August, following
three months of solid increases. The decline owed entirely to lower exports of
goods; exported services rose 1.1 percent. Within goods, exports fell in most
major trade categories. Particularly large declines occurred in agricultural
products, aircraft, and automotive products, which reversed sizable increases in
July. Despite the decline in August, the value of exported goods and services in
July and August on average increased 11 percent at an annual rate from the
second quarter level. About half of the increase owed to services, largely
reflecting a rebound in travel-related activity. The remainder of the two-month
increase was attributable primarily to higher exports of capital goods, particularly
aircraft and computers, and agricultural products.
The value of imported goods and services fell 2.5 percent in August, reflecting
lower imports of goods and unchanged imports of services. The monthly decline
was largely driven by a 13 percent drop in imported automotive products.
Smaller declines were recorded in aircraft, computers, and consumer goods.
Imports of industrial supplies and machinery (other capital goods) increased
moderately. For July and August combined, the value of imported goods and
services increased at an annual rate of 2 percent from the second quarter level.
Higher imports of services and oil (entirely from higher oil prices) more than
offset lower imports of non-oil goods. The decline in imported non-oil goods
resulted mainly from the drop in automotive imports.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Non-oil imports. In September, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and
of core goods rose 0.2 and 0.3 percent, respectively, reversing similarly sized
declines in August. Within core goods, the largest price changes were in
industrial supplies and foods, feeds and beverages. Prices of imported foods,
feeds and beverages rose 0.6 percent in September. The 1.4 percent increase in
the price of industrial supplies was the result of higher prices for lumber and
natural gas. In other major trade categories within core goods, only prices for
capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors experienced a notable
change, falling 0.3 percent. The prices of U.S. imports of computers continued
to decline in September, but semiconductor prices edged higher. In the third
quarter of 2003, the prices of imported core goods rose 1 percent at an annual
rate. The largest contributions came from industrial supplies and capital goods
excluding computers and semiconductors. Prices of computers fell 8 percent
(a.r.), in the third quarter, whereas prices of semiconductors rose 6 percent (a.r.).
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil fell 5.2 percent in September, the first
decrease in the price since May. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) crude oil was also lower in September, averaging $28.29 per barrel, down
more than 10 percent from August. However, the spot price began to rise at the
end of September and has averaged nearly $31 per barrel thus far in October.
The recent increase in the spot price reflects OPEC's decision in late September
to reduce its production target by 900,000 barrels per day effective November 1.
Prices also remain elevated owing in part to the slow return of Iraqi exports.
Exports. In September, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core
goods increased 0.4 and 0.5 percent, respectively. The rise was driven by a
5.5 percent increase in the price of agricultural products. Prices for exported
industrial supplies rose 0.2 percent in September. In other major trade categories
within core goods, prices were little changed. The prices of U.S. exports of
computers and semiconductors both moved lower in September. In the third
quarter, the prices of exported core goods rose at an annual rate of 1 percent. All
of the major categories in core goods experienced price increases, but the largest
rise came from agricultural products.
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Net foreign official inflows remained strong in August at $9 billion (line 1 of the
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) and were little changed from
the inflows in July. Increases were largest for Asia, notably for Japan and Korea,
and for Brazil. Through August, year-to-date foreign official inflows totaled

IV-6
$112 billion. In September, foreign official assets held at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York increased a substantial $32 billion;     
            
 .
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) also continued to be very
strong in August, sustaining the brisk pace set in the second quarter. Though
nearly mirroring the previous month's total net purchases, the distribution of
instruments changed. Foreign acquisitions of Treasury issues declined somewhat
from the exceptionally high levels in July. There were small net sales of agency
debt, and purchases of corporate bonds were lower, which may reflect a decline
in new issuance for the month. In contrast, there was a marked increase in
foreigners' purchases of U.S. equities. These amounted to $12 billion in August,
up from net sales of $8 billion in July, and coincide with the uptick in the U.S.
stock market in August. The net purchases of equities are mostly attributed to
Europe and Canada.
Net U.S. purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b) surged to $15 billion during
August, up from $6 billion in July. For the year through August, U.S. investors'
purchases totaled $57 billion, more than double new foreign investment in U.S.
stocks. U.S. investors' purchases in August were concentrated in Asia with
Taiwan ($7 billion) and Japan ($5 billion) accounting for the largest inflows.
U.S. investors continued their net sales of foreign bonds, but at a slower pace
than in recent months.
The banking sector (line 3) saw net inflows of $11 billion, down from $47 billion
in July. The August net flows reflected large interoffice outflows associated with
repurchase activity in European markets that were more than offset by inflows in
lending and deposits from the Caribbean centers. A number of large revisions
have been made recently to the banking series to correct reporting errors and
omissions. For the first half of this year banking transactions resulted in net
outflows of $35 billion (revised from near zero).
Although merger and acquisition activity was slight, U.S. direct investment
abroad (line 6) continued to expand at a rate near trend in the second quarter,
owing in part to significant reinvested earnings. There are some signs of a
pickup in merger activity and two acquisitions of foreign firms are pending for
the third quarter. Foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7), buoyed
by a large merger in the first quarter, fell back to the lower levels seen last year.

Foreign Exchange Markets
The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index,
fell 4 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar's broad-based
weakness versus other major currencies occurred despite several better-than-
expected U.S. economic data releases, most notably the employment report for
September. Although the dollar did move up following these releases, these
gains proved short-lived.

The negative market sentiment toward the dollar was reinforced on
September 20 by the communiqu6 from the G-7 meeting in Dubai. For the first
time in several years, the G-7 broached the subject of foreign exchange policy,
with market participants paying particular attention to the phrase, "we
emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries
or economic areas to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the
international financial system, based on market mechanisms." Based on their
interpretation of the communique, market participants speculated that the G-7
may have called on Japanese monetary authorities to curtail their intervention
activity. The dollar depreciated sharply against the yen following the release of
the communique, as Japanese monetary authorities did indeed refrain from
intervention until September 30, at which point the yen had already made most
of its gains for the period. For the intermeeting period as a whole, the dollar
depreciated 7 percent versus the yen. The Bank of Japan and the Japanese

IV-9
Cabinet Office both upgraded their assessments of the Japanese economy and
the Japanese stock market outperformed other major indexes.
The dollar depreciated 3¾ percent against the euro, as economic data releases
signaled a pickup in euro-area economic activity. The U.S. dollar depreciated
4 and 5 percent relative to the Canadian and Australian dollars, respectively, as
the continued rise in commodity prices amid expectations of a global recovery
reportedly buoyed these currencies. The Canadian currency touched its highest
level against the U.S. dollar since 1993. Questions about the Administration's
resolve to maintain the "strong dollar" policy amid growing complaints from
U.S. manufacturers about foreign competition appeared to play a role in the
dollar's weakness over the period, as did concerns over the size of the U.S.
fiscal and current account deficits.

Short-term interest rates moved little over the intermeeting period in the major
industrial countries, as central banks kept policy interest rates unchanged. The
Bank of Japan raised the upper limit of its target range for current account
balances at the BOJ by ¥2 trillion to ¥32 trillion and clarified the conditions that
would have to be met before it would end its quantitative easing policy.

IV-10
Long-term rates in most industrial countries were little changed, on balance,
except for the United Kingdom, where the yield on gilts rose 35 basis points.
Futures markets priced in greater expectations of the Bank of England soon
tightening monetary policy after BOE Governor King indicated that improved
global economic activity might prompt action by the Monetary Policy
Committee. Reinforcing these comments, minutes from the October MPC
meeting showed that four of the nine MPC members had voted for a rate hike.
Despite the improved global economic outlook, equity prices in the industrial
countries were mixed over the period. Japanese equities posted a modest
3 percent gain, outperforming shares on U.S. and European exchanges. Share
prices for the Japanese banking sector jumped a heady 17 percent, as reported
earnings by several key institutions came in well above market expectations.
However, the strength of the yen against the dollar did weigh on the share prices
of Japanese exporters, with the automobile sector subindex declining 7 percent.

Emerging markets stocks performed much better over the intermeeting period
than those of industrial countries, as the anticipated global recovery reportedly
helped foster an environment favoring riskier investments. Sentiment towards
emerging markets was further enhanced after Moody's upgraded Russia's
foreign-currency debt rating to investment grade status. Market participants
added to positions in Brazil in hopes that Brazil will be the next country to have
its debt rating upgraded. The yield spread of Brazil's dollar-denominated debt
narrowed 50 basis points. Share prices on South American exchanges rose more
than 12 percent.
Stocks in emerging Asia also performed well, with share prices gaining as much
as 12 percent. Much attention was focused on China's exchange rate policy,
with Bundesbank President Welteke stating that the section in the G-7
communiqué that called for flexibility in exchange rates pertained to countries in
Asia. In addition, some Japanese officials commented that the call for flexibility
was primarily directed at China. The amount of appreciation of the yuan versus
the dollar priced in by twelve-month non-deliverable forward contracts rose by
1½ percentage points, to a total of 4 percent.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available data for the third quarter generally suggest a moderate pace of growth
in the major foreign industrial countries. In Japan, indicators of private
investment and consumption were fairly flat following the second quarter's
impressive gains, but the September Tankan recorded a broad-based increase in
business sentiment. Euro-area surveys, particularly the purchasing managers'
index (PMI) for manufacturing and industrial confidence, suggest that economic
growth turned positive in the third quarter. In the United Kingdom, both the
manufacturing and services PMIs hint at continued recovery. In Canada, data
on GDP by industry, as well as on housing starts and employment, point to
positive growth for the third quarter.
Twelve-month rates of consumer price inflation were little changed in recent
months. Canadian headline inflation inched up to 2.2 percent in September.
The U.K. inflation rate declined slightly, but remained above the 2 percent
target level. In the euro area, inflation held steady, just a bit above the ECB's
2 percent ceiling. In Japan, mild deflation continued.
In Japan, evidence for the third quarter suggests that growth continued at a
moderate pace. For July and August on average, industrial production was up
0.2 percent from the second-quarter level. Indicators of consumer expenditures
suggest only slight changes from second-quarter levels. New car registrations in
the third quarter rose about 2 percent from the second-quarter average, while
household expenditures in July and August on average were about flat compared
to the second quarter. Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business
fixed investment, fell 1.7 percent in July and August on average relative to the
second quarter. Non-residential building starts were about flat in July and
August compared with the second quarter. Both real exports and imports rose in
July and August, on average, from second-quarter levels, but imports grew more
than exports.
Labor market conditions have generally been improving, but mild deflation
continues. In August, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest rate since August
2001, down from a peak of 5.5 percent recorded early this year. The
job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of employment, rose slightly.
Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but
include energy) fell 0.2 percent in September from the previous month, and were
down 0.3 percent from a year earlier. Wholesale prices for domestic goods fell
0.5 percent in September from a year earlier.
On a more positive note, the Bank of Japan's Tankan index of business
conditions rose in September, with the level of the aggregate diffusion index for

business sentiment increasing to -21 from -26 in June. This improvement was
broadly based, with increases for both manufacturers and nonmanufacturers
across nearly all firm sizes. Survey respondents project a further improvement in
the index, to -19, for December. The closely watched index for large
manufacturers entered positive territory for the first time since December 2000,
increasing to 1 from -5 in June. For FY2003, firms generally expect increases in
sales, profits, and investment.
On October 10, the Bank of Japan announced several measures intended to
reinforce its commitment to a policy of quantitative easing. For one, the Bank
increased the upper limit of its target range for the outstanding balance of reserve
accounts held by private financial institutions at the BOJ to ¥32 trillion from ¥30
trillion. (The new target range is thus ¥27-32 trillion, as compared to ¥27-30
trillion previously.) It also announced that its policy of quantitative easing will

IV-14
not be lifted unless the core consumer price index registers inflation of zero
percent or more (on a twelve-month basis) for a few months, and the Bank is
convinced that the core CPI will not fall below zero percent soon thereafter. In
addition, the BOJ will extend the maximum term of its repo operations from six
months to one year.
Prime Minister Koizumi was reelected as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
president on September 20, after which he reshuffled the Cabinet. Heizo
Takenaka retained his posts as head of the Financial Services Agency and
Minister of Economic and Fiscal Policy, despite strong calls for replacing him by
several senior LDP lawmakers. Sadakazu Tanigaki was named Japan's new
finance minister. On October 10, Koizumi dissolved the lower house of the Diet
and called for a general election to be held on November 9.
In the euro area, recent data suggest that economic growth turned positive in the
third quarter. In September, the euro-area PMI for manufacturing rose again,
topping the 50 threshold and indicating expansion for the first time in seven
months; industrial confidence also moved higher. Euro-area industrial
production fell 0.4 percent in August, in part because of a greater than usual
number of holidays in Germany. While this decline offset some of the gain made
in July, the July-August average was 0.5 percent above the second-quarter
average. German manufacturing orders were flat in August, but foreign orders
rose about 2 percent, suggesting that the upturn in global growth is boosting the
German manufacturing sector. German retail sales also picked up in August,
while French retail sales declined. Along with the recent rise in the German PMI
and fall in the French PMI, this raises the possibility that the under-performance
of the German economy relative to the French economy over the past few years
may not have continued in the third quarter.
Euro-area twelve-month consumer price inflation remained just above the ECB's
2 percent ceiling in September. Core inflation, excluding energy and
unprocessed food, reversed its recent declines by moving back up to 2 percent.
The heat wave this summer led to an increase in food price inflation, although
energy price inflation declined in September.
In September, the French government announced measures to reduce its
structural budget deficit by 0.7 percentage points of GDP in 2004. Its goal is to
bring the deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP, down to the 4.0 percent projected for this
year, but still above the 3 percent ceiling required by the Stability and Growth
Pact (SGP). In October, the European Commission (EC) directed France to cut
its deficit next year more than planned but gave it until 2005 to fully comply with
the SGP. Specifically, the EC recommended that France reduce its structural

deficit by a whole percentage point in 2004. If the Council of Finance Ministers
approves the EC recommendation and the French government does not change
its budget accordingly, France could be forced to make a non-interest bearing
deposit of just over 0.2 percent of its GDP. That deposit, which would be placed
with the European Community, would be forfeited if the French government did
not make sufficient progress on deficit reduction over the next two years.
In the United Kingdom, the Office of National Statistics recently released a
considerably revised GDP series. A downward adjustment in 2002 mainly
stemmed from higher imports. Newly released data on construction output
contributed to a substantial upward revision to growth for the second quarter of
2003, from 1.4 percent to 2.4 percent. These revisions coincided with a switch to
chain-weighted GDP, but the adjustments due to the change in methodology
were relatively small.

On balance, data for the third quarter suggest continued recovery. Despite a
considerable drop in manufacturing output in August, September's
manufacturing PMI continued its upward trend and is consistent with further
expansion. Business confidence ticked down in October. The British Chamber
of Commerce's third-quarter survey showed a downturn in manufacturing sales
and orders but a brisk pick-up in the service sector. In September, the services
PMI climbed to its highest level since April 2000. Retail sales rose in August
and the two leading surveys of retail sales edged up in September, while
consumer confidence improved.
Although housing price inflation continued to decrease in September, it was still
at a robust two-digit rate on a twelve-month basis. Consumer borrowing remains
elevated. Net mortgage lending slowed in August, while consumer credit rose.
Mortgage equity withdrawals fell slightly to 6 percent of net income in the
second quarter.
The labor market continues to be tight as unemployment remains near a 28-year
low. Employment rose 0.8 percent in the twelve months ending in July. The
twelve-month rate of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments
(RPIX) inched down in September but remained above the Bank of England's
2½ percent target. The harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) rose

1.4 percent in the twelve months ending in September. Most of the difference
between the RPIX and the HICP can be attributed to the exclusion of housing
components in the latter.
On October 9, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 5 to 4 against raising rates
25 basis points, with both Mervyn King and Rachel Lomax, both of whom many
had thought would be among the first to argue for higher rates, in the majority.
The committee agreed that strength in the housing market suggested that
consumption growth would not moderate as quickly as previously expected, but
the minority contended that inflation would likely be above the target in two
years time as a result, while the majority was concerned that "a premature rise in
the repo rate might choke off the improvement in business conditions."

In Canada, real GDP by industry increased 7.2 percent (a.r.) in July, led by a
strong performance in the auto sector. In August, however, manufacturing
shipments decreased sharply, largely reflecting production disruptions associated
with the Northeast power outage. The effects of the power outage were
particularly evident in the motor vehicle sector, where July's gains were more
than reversed, and in sharp declines in both exports and imports.
Employment rose slightly in the third quarter, as a large increase in September
more than offset losses in July and August. Despite continued weakness in
manufacturing employment, conditions in Canadian labor markets have
improved of late benefitting from rising employment in the booming construction
sector. Housing starts reached a thirteen-year high during the third quarter.
Domestic demand has remained resilient in recent months, with preliminary
estimates indicating that motor vehicle sales climbed in the third quarter to
remain in the vicinity of the record-breaking levels of 2002.

In September, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation rose slightly to
2.2 percent. Higher natural gas prices as well as a large increase in university
tuition contributed to the rise. Twelve-month core inflation, excluding food,
energy prices, and indirect taxes, edged up to 1.8 percent in September.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
The economies of emerging Asia appear to have recovered quickly from the
economic effects of SARS. The Chinese economy, in particular, is racing
ahead. In addition, indicators of high-tech production in the region have
recently shown signs of a rapid expansion. In Latin America, the story is more
uncertain. Recent indicators for Mexico have been mixed, although the
Brazilian economy appears to have bottomed out and the economic recovery in
Argentina has continued.
In general, inflation in the emerging market economies remains in check, with
twelve-month consumer price inflation falling or staying put at already very low
levels in most economies.
Chinese real GDP grew 17.5 percent in the third quarter, with growth boosted
by strength in state-sector investment and exports. All indications are that
China has completely recovered from the economic impact of SARS, with retail
sales and tourism, in particular, having reached pre-SARS levels. Twelve-
month consumer price inflation edged up again in September to just above 1
percent. Despite the low overall inflation figure, Chinese officials are concerned
about possible overheating in some sectors and have made efforts to slow
lending to those sectors. China's trade balance turned negative in September, as
imports surged. Moreover, China's year-to-date trade surplus is considerably
smaller than last year's surplus, and some analysts are forecasting that the trade
balance will be close to zero for the year as a whole.

Despite the narrowing of the trade balance, attention has remained focused on
China's exchange rate regime. Nondeliverable forward contracts point to
appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate over the next twelve months.
Chinese officials continue to insist, however, that no changes to the exchange
rate regime will be made in the near future.
Economic conditions in Hong Kong are rapidly improving as the economic
effects of SARS subside. Retail sales are now above and tourist arrivals are just
below their pre-SARS levels. Moreover, the SARS-related climb in the
unemployment rate appears to have begun to reverse itself. Even the property
sector, which has been in a five-year slump, has recently shown some limited
signs of improving, as recent changes in Chinese laws now allow some
investment in the Hong Kong property market by Chinese companies. Although
the trade balance slipped in August, total trade-a good indicator of economic
activity for Hong Kong's entrepôt economy-remained near historical highs.
Consumer prices continue to fall, although the rate of decline slowed somewhat
in August.

Recent data for Taiwan have been encouraging. Production of high-tech goods
soared in August, although this was largely offset by declines in other
manufacturing sectors and construction. Export order books for electronics are
at levels not seen since the high-tech bubble in 2000. Unemployment fell in the
third quarter, after rising somewhat in the second quarter due to the effects of
SARS. Both exports and imports rose at very rapid rates in September, with the
net effect being a widening of the trade surplus. The renewed economic
strength contributed to an easing of deflationary pressures, with consumer prices
falling only slightly in September on a twelve-month basis.

In Korea, indications are that the economy is recovering, although third-quarter
output was damped by some adverse shocks. A series of labor strikes depressed
industrial production in July, although it bounced back in August, and a typhoon
in mid-September damaged some key infrastructure and hurt agricultural output.
Even so, the unemployment rate has stabilized recently, after rising ½
percentage point earlier in the year. Retail sales were up in August, and
business confidence indicators rose in September. In late September, the
government confirmed that it would introduce a second supplementary budget
this year to help pay for typhoon-related reconstruction. Twelve-month
consumer price inflation inched up in September due to rising agricultural
prices. The trade balance widened in August, as imports declined more than
exports.

In general, the ASEAN economies appear to have recovered from the economic
effects of SARS, with tourist arrivals and consumption indicators at or near
pre-SARS levels. Real GDP in Thailand grew 3.5 percent in the SARS-affected
second quarter, on the back of strong performances in the manufacturing and
construction sectors. The recent behavior of industrial output in the region has
been mixed. Production in Malaysia and Thailand contracted in August, but
Singapore posted an impressive gain due to a surge in output in the
pharmaceuticals industry. In addition, there are signs of strength in high-tech
production in several of these countries. In August, trade balances improved
slightly in Malaysia and the Philippines, while in Indonesia and Thailand
surpluses shrank as exports fell more than imports. Singapore's trade surplus
widened considerably in September due to surging exports. Inflation remained
benign, with only Indonesia posting twelve-month consumer price inflation
greater than 3 percent.

In Mexico, supply-side indicators generally continued to point to some
weakness in economic activity, although the monthly pattern provides some
grounds for encouragement. An index of overall economic activity (a monthly
proxy for real GDP) was about flat in July, but industrial production increased in
August after three consecutive months of decline. Exports registered a small
increase in August, and business confidence appears to be holding up. On the
demand side, there are some tentative indications that consumption spending-a
key component of the strong second-quarter GDP performance-may be losing
some steam. Although retail sales held up in July, some consumer surveys
showed a decline in confidence in August and September. Inflation has
remained in check, with twelve-month consumer price increases recently
coming in at the upper end of the government's 2-4 percent target range.
Inflation expectations for year-end inflation currently stand at about 3.8 percent.

In Brazil, data releases since the last Greenbook suggest that the economy has
bottomed out. Although unemployment climbed in recent months, industrial
production rose 1.5 percent in August, the second consecutive monthly gain
following a sharp decline in June. Production was strongest in the tradeable
goods sectors, consistent with the view that external demand has continued to
fuel growth. Month-to-month consumer price inflation rose in September,
driven largely by an increase in government-regulated prices and gasoline
prices. However, the average of one-year ahead inflation expectations are at 6.3
percent, well below current levels. Brazil has continued to register sizeable
trade surpluses, leading to a small current account surplus.
Prompted by favorable inflation trends and the still weak economy, the central
bank reduced its benchmark interest rate, the Selic, 200 basis points in late
September. The Selic now stands at 20 percent, compared with 26.5 percent last
June.

In Argentina, the economic recovery has continued. Real GDP rose 6.6 percent
in the second quarter, and the average of July and August industrial production
was more than 2 percent above its second quarter average. Consumer price
inflation has continued to decline, with the twelve-month rate falling to
3.5 percent in September.
In mid-September, Argentina and the IMF agreed on a new three-year program.
The final agreement does not include a timetable for utility tariff increases and
does not explicitly require the government to compensate banks for the damage
its crisis-management policies did to their balance sheets, conditions that the
IMF had originally insisted would be necessary. The program sets a target for
the primary surplus in 2004 of 3 percent of GDP, but it does not specify targets
for the two subsequent years.
In late September, Argentina proposed a 75 percent reduction in the face value
of more than $90 billion in defaulted debt owned by private bondholders. Under
Argentina's complex plan, the country would offer investors a choice of three
new bonds-discount bonds, par bonds, and capitalization bonds-in exchange for
152 existing issues denominated in seven currencies and issued in eight
jurisdictions. Bondholders' reaction to the proposal has been largely negative.

In Venezuela, real GDP rebounded in the second quarter, but still remains
20 percent below its end-2001 level. Growth in the second quarter was led by a
recovery in oil production, although non-oil production also experienced a
sizeable increase. Oil production is still believed to be below the level
prevailing before the general strike last December-January. Moreover, analysts
have continued to express doubts about the sustainability of current production
levels, given numerous technical problems following the dismissal by President
Chavez of a large fraction of the employees of the government-owned oil firm
early this year. Unemployment has remained high. Consumer price inflation
fell in September, partly due to price controls and to the fixed exchange rate
regime established last February. On a twelve-month basis, however, inflation
remained above 25 percent. Stringent capital controls remain in place, but have
been loosened somewhat. The official exchange rate is 1,600 bolivares per
dollar, but the black market continued to price the bolivare at a significantly
more depreciated exchange rate.
Venezuela's political outlook remains highly uncertain. The opposition
continues to push for a national referendum that would "recall" President
Chavez, but this does not appear likely to happen any time soon.
