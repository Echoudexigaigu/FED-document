Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economy appears to have expanded at a robust pace again last quarter.  Thefundamentals for consumer spending are quite positive, and activity in theresidential construction sector continues to be extremely strong.  On thebusiness side, outlays for equipment and software likely posted moderate gainsin the fourth quarter, and firms appear to have accumulated inventories for thefirst time in three quarters.  Moreover, conditions in the industrial sector havebrightened considerably since the last Greenbook.  Despite the strong pace ofeconomic activity, the labor market is improving only slowly, with privatepayroll employment showing a small acceleration in the fourth quarter.  Coreconsumer price inflation has continued to slow in the last few months, andinflation expectations have remained subdued.  The twelve-month change in thecore CPI was only 1.1 percent last year, about 3/4 percentage point less than theincrease in 2002.  Labor Market DevelopmentsThe December employment report suggested that the labor market has notgained as much momentum as previously appeared to be the case.  Privatenonfarm payrolls rose only 5,000 in December, and their level in November wasrevised down 35,000.  The average monthly increase in employment in thefourth quarter is now estimated to have been just 44,000, a clear improvementover the average monthly loss of 36,000 during the first half of last year, but stilla fairly weak recovery.
Manufacturing payrolls continued to shrink in December at about the same pace
as in the previous few months.  In addition, holiday-related hiring in retail tradewas below average; however, employment in this industry will likely bounceback this month because the lower rate of seasonal hiring implies fewer seasonallayoffs as well.  Elsewhere, job gains were recorded in December inconstruction, education and health services, and professional and businessservices.  Within business services, employment at temporary help firms rose30,000, continuing the strong performance in this category since last spring.
Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers dropped
0.2 hour to 33.7 hours in December, reversing the gains of the previous twomonths. Aggregate hours fell 0.6 percent last month but increased at an annualrate of 2.2 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole, the first quarterly increasesince the fourth quarter of 2000. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point in
December, to 5.7 percent, and was down more than 1/2 percentage point from

1. With December’s employment report, the BLS released revised seasonal factors for series
pertaining to the labor force going back to 1999.  Resulting revisions to the unemployment ratewere small.
Prior to the December report, the BLS estimat ed seasonal factors twice a year.  Beginning
with the December report, new seasonal factors will be estimated every month and applied to thecurrent month’s data, though revisions to hi storical data will occur only once a year.
2. In the week ending December 27, 792,000 persons filed continuing claims under the
Temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program.  Current law does notallow individuals to enroll in the TEUC program after December 27.  However, individuals whowere already enrolled in the program as of that week will continue to receive benefits until their
eligibility expires.last summer.1  These movements in the unemployment rate seem at odds with
the message conveyed by the payroll data.  However, as suggested by theextended decline in the labor force participation rate, a partial explanation forthe paradox could be that marginal workers are staying out of the labor force inreaction to poor hiring prospects in greater numbers than has historically beenthe case.  Indeed, the employment-population ratio—which captures the neteffects of movements in labor force participation and unemployment—haschanged little, on balance, since the summer after having dropped considerablybetween early 2001 and the first half of last year.  Another indication thatemployed workers still view job opportunities as very limited is the short-termquit rate (the number of individuals who chose to leave their previous job andhave been unemployed less than five weeks as a percent of householdemployment), which fell sharply in December and has trended downward, onbalance, since 2001.   
In the weeks following the reference week for the December employment
report, initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to drift down,suggesting improved job growth in January.  For the week ending January 10,the four-week moving average of initial claims stood at 347,000, the lowestlevel since February 2001.  The four-week moving average of insuredunemployment fell to 3.23 million for the week ending January 3, its lowestlevel since September 2001.
2  Although the claims data suggest that job losses
have tapered off, new hiring apparently remains sluggish.  In December, theproportion of unemployment insurance recipients who exhausted their benefitsbefore finding a job stood near last year’s high average level.  
Other indicators of labor market conditions have been mixed.  Survey data from
the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) indicate that hiring
plans of small firms rose sharply in December.  The latest readings fromManpower Inc.’s survey of firms’ hiring plans and the Conference Board’s helpwanted index—both of which tend to be less volatile than the NFIB measure—improved, though by much less than the NFIB survey.  The Conference Boardreported that households’ assessments of current labor market conditionsworsened a bit in December, though they are still better than they were last

summer.  In contrast, optimism about future labor market conditions increased
significantly in the latest readings from both the Conference Board andMichigan surveys.
Industrial Production  
The pace of expansion in the industrial sector picked up in the fourth quarter.Total IP rose at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, the largest increase since thesecond quarter of 2000.  Manufacturing production jumped 6.6 percent on gainsthat were widespread across both industry and market groups.  After havingsurged in the third quarter, the output of motor vehicles and parts moved up atabout the same rate as overall manufacturing in the fourth quarter.  Output atmines increased at a 3 percent rate, while output at utilities rose at a5-1/2 percent rate, led by another solid increase in electricity generation thatmirrored the strengthening in the manufacturing sector.
High-tech industries accounted for nearly 30 percent of the increase in total IP
in the fourth quarter.  Semiconductor production has continued to chalk upsignificant gains, led by increases in the output of chips.  Recent revenueguidance from Intel for the current quarter is consistent with another increase insemiconductor production, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter. Capacity utilization at chipmakers moved above 90 percent last quarter, andrecent data on semiconductor equipment orders suggest that demand for theequipment needed to expand capacity has rebounded.  Elsewhere in high tech,computer production stepped up from an average monthly change of 2 percent
in the third quarter to 2-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter.  IP for communicationsequipment more than retraced a dip in the third quarter and ended 2003 morethan 8 percent above its level a year earlier.
Outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high tech, production at all
stages of processing posted gains in the fourth quarter.  The output of finishedproducts, led by solid increases in business equipment and consumer durables,moved up at an annual rate of 3.5 percent after having edged up 0.6 percent inthe previous quarter.  Production at the earlier stages of processing, primary andsemifinished production, has been on an upward trend since the middle of 2003. These broad-based gains stand in contrast to the first half of 2002, when asimilar increase in production at the primary and semifinished stages was notsupported by a pickup in the output of finished goods.  Widespread increasespushed the November diffusion index of three-month percent changes in IP toits highest level since 1987, and even though the index ticked down inDecember, it was above 50 for a sixth consecutive month.
Although total IP rose just 0.1 percent in December following an average
monthly gain of 0.7 percent in the previous three months, the forward-lookingindicators of near-term production suggest that industrial activity will continueto strengthen.  In particular, the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) index

II-9
of new orders jumped to a near-record level of 77.6 in December.  More
recently, the Philadelphia Fed’s new orders index for January ticked down butremained at a high level.  The three-month moving average of the staff’s seriesfor real adjusted durable goods orders rose 1.5 percent in November. Announced manufacturing layoffs declined for a second month in December,and announcements so far in January are on track to fall further.  Weekly datafor January point to a noticeable pickup in motor vehicle assemblies.  Outside ofmotor vehicles, the available weekly production data suggest that the weeklyindustrial aggregate will contribute about 0.1 percentage point to the change intotal IP.

In the ISM’s Semiannual Economic Forecast that was released in December, the
number of manufacturing purchasing managers who indicated that theircompanies plan to increase capital expenditures in 2004 exceeded the numberthat indicated a planned decrease; a diffusion index of these responses correlateswell with annual changes in manufacturing investment.  Coupled with the lowfactory operating rate, this diffusion index suggests that manufacturinginvestment in 2004 will increase modestly after having fallen in the previousthree years.  Such an increase would be consistent with a capacity gain ofaround 1-3/4 percent, a bit higher than the annual gains of about 1 percentrecorded in the past two years, but still well below the average increase of3-1/4 percent that prevailed from 1972 to 2001.

5. Of the increase of 1.2 million units in light motor vehicle sales from November to
December, we estimate that roughly 800,000 units were attributable to the retail sector. Motor Vehicles
Light-vehicle sales jumped in December to an annual rate of 18 million units,more than a million units above November’s sales pace.  Although the step-upin sales was likely spurred, in part, by the high level of incentives on newmodel-year vehicles, much of the increase likely reflected robust underlyingconsumer demand.
5  For the fourth quarter as a whole, sales averaged
16.8 million units, down sharply from the torrid third-quarter pace, but wellabove the average rate recorded in the first half of last year.  
While estimates of the average incentive per vehicle crept up slightly in
December, the average figure masks the fact that discounts increasingly wereplaced on new, more desirable, model-year vehicles.  The Big Three firms, inparticular, offered heavy promotions on their 2004 model-year vehicles and, inturn, increased their market share in December almost 4 percentage points fromthat in November.  Not surprisingly, car-buying attitudes—as measured in theMichigan Survey—remained at a high level in January.  Early this month, ourindustry contacts reported that they are seeing some payback from the unusuallystrong sales in December, and their projections for January as a whole rangedbetween 16.2 and 16.5 million units (excluding medium and heavy trucks). Incentives dropped noticeably early in the month, as the automakers apparentlymade efforts to back off from the large discounts offered in the fourth quarter.
With production at a robust annual rate of 12.2 million units in the fourth
quarter, light-vehicle inventories ended the year up noticeably from the level atthe end of the third quarter.  Days’ supply averaged 69 days in the fourthquarter, a bit above the manufacturers’ targeted range.  Despite the elevatedlevel of inventories, the automakers’ latest production plans call for a furtherincrease in assemblies in the first quarter, to 12.5 million units.

Consumer Spending
Consumer spending appears to have increased at a solid pace at the end of 2003. Although December figures on outlays for services are not yet available, thedata on retail sales and sales of light vehicles are consistent with an increase inreal personal consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter at an annual rate ofroughly 3 percent.  Although personal income gains likely slowed last monthowing to the drop in hours worked, the gradual improvement in labor marketconditions, recent stock market gains, and upbeat readings on consumerconfidence suggest that the momentum in household spending should besustained going forward.  Nominal spending in the retail control category of goods—which excludes autodealers and building material and supply stores—increased 0.7 percent inNovember and 0.2 percent in December; after accounting for price changes, weestimate that real spending in this category rose 1.0 percent in November andwas flat in December.  Real expenditures on services climbed 0.3 percent inNovember after having increased 0.1 percent in the previous month.
Real disposable personal income advanced smartly in November, with sizable
gains in private wages and salaries and proprietors’ income.  The personalsaving rate was 1.8 percent in November, below its level last summer when theadvance rebates of the child tax credit were flowing to households but aboutequal to the revised level at the end of 2002. 
In December, both the Michigan Survey Research Center’s index of consumer
sentiment and the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence stood well 
II-14
II-15
II-16
above their average readings last year, and the preliminary Michigan report for
January surged to its highest level since November 2000.  The recent upturnreflected significant improvements in consumers’ assessments of both currentand expected economic conditions.
Housing Markets  
Activity in housing markets remains very robust.  In December, single-family starts edged down only a bit from the stunning rate they hadreached in November, to an annual rate of 1.66 million units.  New permitissuance (adjusted for activity in areas where permits are not required)moved up briskly to its highest level in more than twenty-five years, whichnarrowed noticeably the gap that had emerged between permits and starts. Although starts are likely to move closer in line with permits over thecoming months, the high level of permits and the low level of mortgagerates suggest that single-family construction will remain quite elevated.  Inthe multifamily sector, starts moved up to an annual rate of 424,000 unitsin December, its highest level in almost four years, despite high and risingvacancy rates through the third quarter of last year. 
New home sales declined in November for the third consecutive month, though
the 1.08 million-unit annual rate was well above most previous readings. Similarly, existing home sales have fallen back from September’s high, but thelevel in November was still noticeably higher than average sales in the first halfof 2003.  
Other indicators also suggest that housing demand will be well maintained in the
near term.  The four-week moving average of purchase applications from theMortgage Bankers Association and attitudes toward homebuying in theMichigan survey have both remained at relatively high levels.  Rates onfixed-rate mortgages have edged down during the past few months and are
now less than half a percentage point above the historical low recorded lastJune.  Meanwhile, rates on adjustable-rate mortgages have flattened out nearlast year’s low average level.
Prices of new homes continued to rise briskly through November.  The median
price was 15-1/2 percent higher than twelve months earlier, its largest increasein more than fifteen years.  In the much larger market for existing homes, thetwelve-month change in the median price slowed in November to 6 percent. Neither of these price measures adjusts for shifts in the characteristics ofhomes sold.  The constant-quality price index for new homes, which controlsfor changes in geographic composition, home size, and other amenities,accelerated 3 percentage points to a 7-1/4 percent rate of increase over the yearending in the third quarter of 2003 (the latest available data).

there reported that their sales to rental car comp anies and to other businesses rose in December. compositional shifts that can affect the median price, was 5-1/2 percent higher
in the third quarter than a year earlier, its smallest four-quarter change sinceearly 1999. Equipment and SoftwareBusiness outlays for equipment and software seem to be recovering from thepoor performance of the past several years.  Spending in the second half of lastyear likely received a significant boost from sharp gains in business output andcorporate cash flow as well as the low level of the user cost of capital.  In thetransportation sector, business purchases of new motor vehicles and aircraft bothappear to have strengthened.  Elsewhere, spending on capital goods likelyadvanced at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter after having moved upappreciably in third quarter.
In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computing equipment dropped
2.4 percent in November (not at an annual rate), partially reversing the previousmonth’s run-up.  Nonetheless, given the ongoing decline in computer prices,real outlays for computing equipment appear to have posted another sizableincrease in the fourth quarter.  Nominal shipments of communicationsequipment fell slightly in November, and orders dropped precipitously afterhaving registered large increases in the previous two months.  Smoothingthrough the volatility of these series, real spending on communicationsequipment seems to have hit a lull in the fourth quarter after three quarters ofdouble-digit growth.  Real business purchases of software are likely to haveincreased a good bit in the fourth quarter, according to revenue reports nowavailable from some of the major software vendors.
Increases in nominal shipments of civilian aircraft and parts in October and
November suggest that business spending on aircraft rebounded noticeably inthe fourth quarter, although investment in this category still lingers far below thelevels that prevailed before the downturn.  Elsewhere in transportation, fleetsales of light vehicles jumped in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of3.6 million units, more than 400,000 units above the average pace of sales in thethird quarter.
6  Sales of medium and heavy trucks also rose in the fourth quarter
and reached their highest level since early 2001.  In a sign of continuedimprovement in truck demand, net new orders for medium and heavy truckssurged in December. 
Outside of high-tech and transportation, nominal shipments were nearly
unchanged in November after having edged down in October.  However, new

the comprehensive revision—includes both office buildings and other commercial structures.orders rose 1.5 percent in November, and the uptrend in orders since the
beginning of last year points to further gains in spending in this category. 
Nonresidential Construction
After holding roughly steady, on balance, in the first half of 2003, real spendingon private nonresidential construction appears to have slipped further in both thethird and fourth quarters.  In the commercial and health care sector and themanufacturing sector, which together account for roughly half of totalinvestment in nonresidential structures, average nominal outlays in October andNovember were about unchanged from the previous quarter.
7  However,
spending on other types of structures was down, on balance, over the sameperiod.  Expenditures for drilling and mining likely rose in the fourthquarter, owing to a continued increase in natural gas drilling activity.  
Recent indicators of market conditions in the office sector suggest little
improvement:  Rents in the third quarter (the latest available data) weredown a bit from their level a year earlier, and property values were littlechanged.  The vacancy rate edged down but remained at a high level in thefourth quarter.  For other commercial buildings, the indicators are mixed: Rents for retail structures and warehouses have been flat or have fallenfurther through the first three quarters of 2003; nonetheless, the value ofretail and wholesale properties increased considerably, perhaps reflectingan improved outlook for future rents.   InventoriesThe book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motorvehicles increased significantly in November for the third month in a row. Stocks at manufacturers were down a little, on average, in October andNovember, but nonauto wholesalers and retailers accumulated inventories at abrisk pace.  Strong increases in sales, however, kept book-value inventory-salesratios at or near their recent lows.
More recently, the Board staff’s flow-of- goods system indicated that the days’
supply of inventories edged down for a second month in December.  The onlyindustries that appeared to have elevated days’ supply levels were paper andcommunications equipment.
Federal Government
Higher defense spending as well as the revenue loss associated with the Jobs
and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act continued to put upward pressureon the federal unified budget deficit.  Adjusted for shifts in the timing ofoutlays, the federal government recorded a cumulative $60 billion deficit in 
II-23
II-24
II-25
II-26
November and December, up about $16 billion from the same period a year
earlier. 
Adjusted outlays were almost $20 billion higher than in the same period a year
earlier.  Defense spending in November and December was up sharply fromyear-earlier levels; however, in spite of the large boost in defenseappropriations for fiscal year 2004, the level of defense spending in recentmonths is not much higher than in the second quarter of last year.  Meanwhile,outlays for Medicare and income security were only slightly higher, and netinterest and agriculture expenditures were lower than a year earlier. 
Adjusted receipts in November and December were up less than 1 percent
from a year earlier.  Individual income and payroll taxes were little changed,and corporate tax payments were up only modestly from the same period ayear earlier.  The weak growth in tax receipts largely reflected the individualincome tax cuts and corporate expensing provisions passed last spring.
The Congress has not yet passed seven of thirteen appropriations bills, and
operations are being funded through a continuing resolution that expires onJanuary 31.  An omnibus bill will likely be passed shortly.
State and Local Governments
Recent monthly indicators suggest that real state and local spending rose in thefourth quarter.  After a prolonged period of weakness, employment in the sectorincreased in each of the three months in the quarter.  Meanwhile, governmentspending on construction increased steadily for eight consecutive months, andthe October-November average stood nearly 4-1/2 percent above the averagelevel in the fourth quarter of 2002.  Highway construction, in particular, hasmoved up noticeably in recent months.
The pickup in spending coincides with several reports released late last year that
indicate that state finances are improving.  Sources noted that growth in state
revenues has moved up relative to a year ago, and fewer states are facingsignificant fiscal difficulties.  Nonetheless, numerous states, includingCalifornia, New Jersey, and New York, will likely have to address budgetshortfalls for fiscal year 2005.  Legislat ures in 44 states will be holding sessions
this year, with the majority beginning in January.  Relative to the early 1990s,when tax hikes figured prominently in states’ budget balancing strategies, thelevel of anti-tax sentiment now appears to be higher; states appear to be morefocused on spending cuts and borrowing in order to bring budgets intoalignment.

Prices and Labor Costs
Prices of consumer goods and services other than food and energy continued todecelerate through the end of last year.  Overall consumer prices were flat, onbalance, during the past three months, as a small increase in core prices and alarge rise in food prices were offset by a noticeable drop in energy prices.  Overthe twelve months ending in December, the CPI was up 1.9 percent,1/2 percentage point below the rate recorded in 2002.  The core CPI decelerateda sharper 3/4 percentage point over the same period.
Consumer energy prices rose 0.2 percent in December after having dropped
3.0 percent in the previous month; natural gas prices turned up, and gasolineprices only edged down following larger declines in the two previous months. Survey data for the first half of January point to a large increase in the CPI forgasoline this month.  In early January, an Arctic cold wave in New England ledto a sharp runup in spot prices for natural gas; however, spot prices have since retreated, on balance, to slightly above the average level in December, and  natural gas inventories were reported to have remained at comfortable levels. At the retail level, natural gas prices are likely to rise further in January as theearlier jumps in spot prices are passed through.
The CPI for food rose 0.6 percent in December, about in line with the average
monthly gain in the previous two months.  Much of December’s increasereflected a further surge in the price of beef that occurred prior to the discoveryof mad cow disease in domestic herds late last month.  Since the mad cowannouncement on December 23, live cattle prices have fallen by almost20 percent, and a portion of this decline should show through early this year toconsumer prices for beef.  Overall food prices jumped 3.6 percent last year, apickup of about 2 percentage points from the preceding year.  The accelerationreflected broad-based increases in both domestic and foreign demand, as well assome delays in ramping up supplies to meet the higher prices.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent in December after
having posted a similar decline in November.  The twelve-month change in coreconsumer prices was 1.1 percent, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in2002.  The slowdown last year was widespread:  Core goods prices dropped 2.5 percent, compared with a decline of 1.5 percent in the previous twelvemonths, while prices of core services rose 2.6 percent in 2003, a deceleration of0.8 percentage point.  
Core PCE prices were unchanged in November (the latest available data) and
are estimated to have risen 0.1 percent last month.  Over the twelve monthsending in November, core PCE prices increased 0.8 percent, compared with a1.5 percent rise in the previous twelve months.  The step down in core PCEinflation was a bit less than the deceleration in the core CPI.  In contrast to manytimes in the past when the difference in behavior could be explained by prices of

8. PCE medical services prices, which are base d on PPIs rather than CPIs, and which have a
much larger weight in PCE than in the CPI, have accelerated, while the CPI for medical services
has decelerated over the past year.  In addition, the deceleration in the price of housing services,
while similar for both indexes, has a much smaller weight in PCE than in the CPI.PCE items not included in the CPI and for which no market-based prices exist,
the most recent discrepancy is centered in the market-based components.  TheBEA’s new measure of the market-based component of core PCE pricesdecelerated 0.3 percentage point over the year ending in November, noticeablyless than the core CPI or core PCE prices.  Relative to the CPI, the smallerdeceleration in core market-based PCE prices reflects a number of factors, butdifferences in the contributions of medical and housing services prices appear toaccount for much of the gap.
8  
The PPI for capital equipment edged down 0.1 percent in December but was up
0.9 percent over the twelve months of 2003, a noticeable pickup from the0.6 percent decline in the preceding year.  The acceleration last year owed toswings in the indexes for cars and light trucks, which increased in 2003 afterhaving fallen in the previous two years.  Prices at earlier stages of processinghave been increasing at rates that are broadly consistent with the pickup inindustrial activity as well as with rising prices for both petroleum products andnon-energy imports.  The PPI for core intermediate materials increased0.1 percent in December and 2.1 percent for 2003 as a whole, an acceleration ofabout 3/4 percentage point from the preceding year.
Commodity prices have continued to move up at a brisk pace since the last
Greenbook.  The Journal of Commerce industrial price index has increasednearly 4 percent and is up almost 25 percent from a year ago.  Among thevarious commodities in this index, a surge in the prices of metals and petroleumsince the December Greenbook was partly offset by a sizable decline inplywood prices.  The Commodity Research Bureau’s price index for spotindustrial commodities, which excludes forest products and energy, has risenabout 7 percent since the last Greenbook and is also up nearly 25 percentrelative to its level a year ago. 
Broad measures of overall inflation picked up over the year ending in the third
quarter of 2003, owing in large part to a surge in energy prices:  The GDP priceindex rose 1.7 percent, compared with a 1.4 percent increase over the precedingfour quarters.  Excluding food and energy, the price index for GDP rose1.3 percent over the same period, a half percentage point less than in thepreceding year.
Median year-ahead expected inflation, as measured by the Michigan survey, was
little changed at 2.7 percent in early January.  Median expected consumer priceinflation over the next five to ten years ticked up early this year, to 2.9 percent,

and moved toward the upper end of the narrow range that has prevailed over the
past few years. 
Since the last Greenbook, we have received little new information regarding
labor costs.  Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workerson private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.2 percent in December after having edged up0.1 percent in November.  Over the twelve months of 2003, average hourlyearnings increased 2.0 percent, down from the 3-1/4 percent rate recorded inboth 2001 and 2002.

have not yet been released, notably, complete data on motor vehicles and capital stocks.Appendix
Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts
On December 10 the Bureau of Economic Analysis released a comprehensive revision
of the national income and product account s (NIPA) for the period from 1929 through
the second quarter of 2003; on December 23 the BEA released the “final” NIPAestimate for the third quarter of 2003.
1  In a comprehensive revision—which occurs
every four or five years—the BEA modifies concepts (the definition of components),adjusts methods of measurement (the appr oach to measuring components), and updates
source data (the data used to implement the measurement methods).  The revisionannounced in December did not feature any revolutionary changes in measurementmethods comparable to the 1996 introduction of chain weighting, or major conceptualchange like the 1999 redefinition of software as a final investment good, but it didintroduce several important improvements of each type.
The key conceptual revisions included cha nges to the measurement of property and
casualty insurance services, which had previ ously been based on premiums earned less
actual payouts.  In the revision, the BEA added insurers’ expected investment income
from the portion of reserves that belong to policyholders.  Moreover, the BEA replacedcurrent payouts with a measure of “normal” payouts (calculated as a moving average ofpast payouts); this change somewhat reduced the volatility of nominal GDP and PCE,as well as of GDP and PCE price inflation, around catastrophes such as HurricaneAndrew (1992) and the 2001 terrorist attacks.  
The BEA also changed the measurement of imputed bank services by recognizing that
borrowers as well as depositors benefit fro m banks’ financial intermediation.  
Previously, the BEA had assumed that the entire difference between what banks earn
from loans and what they pay out on depos its represented implicit services provided to
depositors.  By shifting a substantial share of banking services from depositors to
borrowers—and thus effectively from hou seholds to businesses, for whom such
services are an intermediate input—this change reduced the level of nominal GDP byabout $90 billion in 2001, but it did not significantly affect the rates of change of realGDP or PCE. 
Among the BEA’s revisions to measurement were improved methods for estimating
corporate profits before tax data become available and for estimating PCE hotel and
motel services, improvements to residences,  price indexes for business structures and
software, and net transactions and dealer marg ins for used motor vehicles.  In addition,
the BEA incorporated the 1997 benchmark input-output accounts and source data thathave become available since the most recent annual revision in July 2002.  
Finally, for purposes of presentation, the reference year for chain-type quantity and
price indexes and for chain-dollar estimates was updated from 1996 to 2000.  Thisrebasing has no effect on rates of change.
II-A-2
2. The previous estimate of a small rise in  real GDP in 2000:Q3 has been revised to a
decline.  But an upward revision in 2000:Q4 leaves  the change in real GDP in the second half of
2000 essentially the same as previously reported.
3. The BEA’s new methodology applies to property and casualty insurance but not life
insurance.  As a result, the terrorist attacks ar e now estimated to have reduced the net cost of
insurance in PCE by $10-1/2 billion in 2001:Q3, compared with the earlier assumption of$18 billion.Real GDP
The average rate of change in real GDP, whether measured over the past several years
or over longer historical periods, was hardly  changed by this revision.  The average
annual rate of increase in real GDP from 1929 to 2002 was unrevised at 3.4 percent, andthe basic pattern of previous business cycles was preserved.  In the latest recession, real
GDP is now estimated to have declined at an  average annual rate of 0.7 percent over the
first three quarters of 2001 (for a cumulative decline of 0.5 percent), versus the earlierestimate of 0.8 percent (for a cumulative decline of 0.6 percent).
2  Between the trough
and the second quarter of 2003, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent;the earlier estimate was 2.7 percent.  The longer-run rates of change of mostcomponents of GDP were also little revised, with the notable exception of spending atboth the federal and state and local government  levels, for which the change in recent
years was revised down a fair bit.  
Prices
Revisions to core PCE prices were fairly small despite several importantmethodological changes to the index.  The revisions to the measurement of bankingservices noted above significantly reduced the share of these services in PCE and,hence, the share of imputed bank service char ges in the PCE price index.  In addition,
the smoothed measure of payouts now used to compute the net cost of property andcasualty insurance attenuated—but did not eliminate—the swing in PCE prices inducedby the September 11 terrorist attacks.
3
The BEA’s new index of market-based core PCE inflation (available since 1997) differssignificantly from the series that the Board st aff had put together earlier.  The new BEA
series indicates that market-based core  PCE prices decelerated a cumulative
0.4 percentage point over the course of the eight quarters ending in 2003:Q2, whereasthe Board staff’s pre-revision measure implied a 1.2 percentage point deceleration.  Ofthe 0.8 percentage point difference between the BEA and Board staff series,0.3 percentage point is attributable to re visions to the underlying data.  An additional
0.2 percentage point reflects the BEA’s inclusion of a large fraction of brokerage fees inthe index; we had excluded brokerage fees from our estimates of the market-based
II-A-3
4. The BEA first began to use PPIs to measur e certain types of brokerage fees in the 2002
annual revision to the NIPA; hence, starting in 1999, roughly half of this component of PCE was
“market based.”  To maintain a historically cons istent series, the Board staff continued to treat
brokerage fees as part of nonmarket PCE for the post-1998 data.
5. In particular, the BEA’s definition of ma rket-based services includes premium payments
for several types of insurance; published data  show only net insurance costs, defined as
premiums paid less benefits received.  The BEA’ s staff has indicated that it plans to make the
unpublished data available in the near future, which should permit us to better reconcile the
published series with our earlier estimate.
6. Prior to the comprehensive revision, the BEA’s insurance adjustments boosted  GDP
inflation by 1 percentage point in 2001:Q3, because the insurance-related reduction in measuredPCE prices was more than offset by a reduction in  measured prices of imported services (which
raises GDP inflation).  In the current  data, the BEA’s insurance adjustments lower  GDP inflation
in 2001:Q3 by 0.4 percentage point.
7. The change  in compensation was revised down in 2002 owing primarily to a downward
revision to wages and salaries attributable to more complete source data.measure.4  The remaining difference is more difficult to explain, but it appears to result
from the BEA’s use of unpublished source data for its market-based series.5
Upward revisions to GDP prices, particularly  in late 2001, flattened somewhat the path
of GDP price inflation over the past couple of years.  These revisions stemmed partlyfrom upward revisions to government prices; in addition, the BEA’s new methodologyfor estimating insurance prices reduces so me of the measured deceleration in GDP
prices over the four quarters ending in 2002:Q3.
6
Income-Side MeasuresThe comprehensive revision generated larg er changes on the income side of the
accounts.  The BEA revised down its estimate of nominal wages and salaries for the1989-2002 period but increased its estimate of em ployer contributions for pensions and
health insurance starting in the mid-1990s; on balance, the level of compensation was
revised up from 1997 on.
7  The BEA also revised its estimates of other components of
personal income.  All told, however, pers onal consumption was revised up more than
was income and by enough to reduce the personal saving rate an average of0.8 percentage point from 1992 through the first half of last year.
Economic profits as a share of GNP are higher than previously reported in each year
since 1992, with an especially large upward revision in 2002.  A good deal of the 2002revision reflects the new methodology that the BEA introduced to estimate the effect ofstock-option exercises on corporate profits befo re corporate tax data become available; 
this new method results in a lower estimate of stock-option exercises in that year.
Net saving by state and local governments excluding social insurance funds—roughly
equal to the surplus in the operating accounts of these governments—now appears tohave turned negative in the fourth quarter of  2001, a full year later than in the unrevised
data.  In addition, the average deficit ove r the period from the fourth quarter of 2001
through the third quarter of 2003 was revised  down from an annual rate of $41 billion
to an annual rate of $11 billion.  These re visions primarily reflected new source data
II-A-4
8. Publication of revised data through 2002 was scheduled for January 10 but has been
delayed because of the lag in the availability of the new BEA estimates for output.  As part of the
comprehensive revision, the BEA changed its defi nition of the nonfarm business sector to match
the definition used by the BLS.  This cha nge itself will have no effect on the published
productivity figures, as the definition used by the BLS has not changed.showing lower spending and higher property tax receipts; conceptual changes were
minimal and had little effect.
The nominal statistical discrepancy, whic h measures the difference between GDP and
gross domestic income, was revised up for most years since the late 1980s.  Thediscrepancy is now more positive in the years from 1989 to 1997; it remains negativefrom 1998 through 2002 but now appears to be roughly zero in the first half of last year. Upward revisions to some components of PCE—stemming importantly from newmethods for estimating sales of used motor vehicles and hotel and motel lodgingservices—raised the level of GDP but did not  generate comparable revisions on the
income side.
Productivity
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has yet to publish figures on labor productivity that incorporate the NIPA revision, but the Board staff estimates that revisions to previouslypublished productivity data for recent years will be small.
8  The cumulative increase in
productivity between 1995 and the cyclical p eak in 2001 will likely be revised up about
1 percentage point, while the subsequent cu mulative change will likely be revised down
by 0.6 percentage point.  We expect the fu ll historical revision to raise the level of
productivity in the second quarter of 2003 by 0.3 percent.

2001 2002 2003Interest Rates and Policy Expectations
Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Over the intermeeting period, equity prices staged a broad rally as investorexpectations of corporate earnings continued to improve.  Nonetheless,intermediate- and long-term interest rates declined, as mixed economic data andthe release of the October FOMC minutes pushed down the expected path forthe federal funds rate after the first quarter of this year. Demand for businesscredit remained subdued in the fourth quarter, and the growth of household debtappears to have slowed a bit.
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates
The FOMC’s statement following its December meeting—in particular, the shiftto a near balance of the risks to inflation—prompted an initial rise in Treasuryyields.  Two days later, however, yields dropped after the release of the minutesof the October FOMC meeting, as market participants reportedly focused on theCommittee’s view that output growth might not “entirely eliminate currentlylarge margins of unemployed labor and other resources until perhaps the latterpart of 2005 or even later.”  Over the subsequent weeks, yields edged upbecause of better-than-expected initial claims and ISM manufacturing surveydata, but those effects were more than offset by a marked decline after theDecember employment report, which was much weaker than expected.
On balance since the December FOMC meeting, yields on Treasury coupon
securities declined about 25 basis points.  Yields on ten-year TIPS decreasedless than comparable nominal Treasury yields, implying a decline in ten-yearinflation compensation of about 10 basis points. 
Judging from surveys and futures market quotes, investors see virtually no
chance that the FOMC will change the target federal funds rate at the upcomingmeeting.  Further along the curve, implied rates on eurodollar futures contractsthat expire in the middle of this year and beyond declined 25 to 50 basis pointson balance over the intermeeting period, as market participants pushed backtheir expectations for the commencement of a monetary policy tightening. Futures quotes suggest that investors anticipate that policy tightening will beginin the second half of this year and will push the federal funds rate up about50 basis points by year-end.  Measures of uncertainty around the expected pathfor monetary policy have moved down since the last FOMC meeting. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Risk Spreads
Broad equity price indexes climbed nearly 7 percent over the intermeetingperiod, reaching highs not seen since before September 11, 2001.  Technologyand small-cap shares outperformed the overall market, rising about 10 percent. Although the economic news was mixed, the outlook for earnings continued to 
III-2
III-3
improve, and market commentary pointed to that improvement as the source of
the further rise in equity prices.  The forward-earnings yield on the S&P 500index edged down over the intermeeting period, but the gap over the realTreasury yield remained in the upper part of the range seen over the past twodecades.  The forward price-earnings ratio for technology companies in the S&P500 has bounced around in recent months but continues to be somewhatelevated relative to its historical average, suggesting that investors expect thehigher earnings growth at technology firms to be sustained.  Implied volatilityfor the S&P 500 has remained low and that for the Nasdaq has moved downsince the last FOMC meeting.  
Risk spreads on upper-tier investment-grade corporate bonds have been about
unchanged since the last FOMC meeting, while spreads on lower-tierinvestment-grade and speculative-grade bonds moved lower.  Commercial paperrisk spreads have stayed well below historical averages, and year-end pressuresnever materialized in this market, likely in part because issuers most subject torollover risk exited the market as it continued to shrink last year.
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality
Analysts’ expectations for S&P 500 earnings per share for the fourth quarter oflast year currently stand at 21 percent above their year-earlier level.  As in thepast couple of quarters, negative guidance has been largely absent, indicatingthat actual growth will come in even higher.  Moreover, analysts have revisedup their expectations for this year’s earnings.
Corporate credit quality appears to have continued to improve.  Bond
downgrades moderated considerably in the second half of last year. Correspondingly, the realized bond default rate remained quite low at the end ofthe year, and the expected year-ahead default rate based on firm-specificmeasures from the KMV Corporation droppe d further.  Allegations of corporate
fraud at Parmalat did not generate notable  fallout in U.S. financial markets, in
part because the company’s debt is mostly euro-denominated and is not widelyheld by U.S. investors.
Business Finance
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms held up in December, but retirementswere sizable, leaving net bond issuance slightly negative.  Commercial paperoutstanding ran off sharply, partly refl ecting the paring back of programs by
some cash-laden retailers, and outstanding C&I loans also posted a substantialcontraction (on a month-end basis).  For the fourth quarter as a whole, the sumof these components of nonfinancial business financing moved further intonegative territory, as firms relied on substantial cash cushions built up fromprofits and the proceeds from past borrowing to finance spending.
III-4
III-5
III-6
III-7
Though overall demand for financing has been weak, credit conditions have
been favorable, especially for riskier credits.  Speculative-grade firms haveraised substantial amounts in the bond market, accounting for about 40 percentof gross bond issuance in the past two quarters—considerably more than inrecent years.  In addition, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveyindicated that banks, on net, had eased credit standards and some lending termson C&I loans over the past three months.
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms dropped back in December from a
particularly robust November pace.  The slowdown was concentrated inseasoned offerings, as the IPO market continued its gradual recovery last month. Equity retirements in the fourth quarter—from both repurchases and cash-financed mergers—appear to have maintained a pace similar to that seen earlierin the year.  Share repurchases have remained strong despite the dividend tax cutlast year, which may reflect the funding of stock options as well as somecompanies’ ongoing preference for the flexibility of distributing cash throughshare repurchases rather than dividends. Overall, net equity issuance in thefourth quarter was a little less negative than it was earlier in the year.
Commercial Real Estate
The growth of commercial mortgage debt likely remained strong in the fourthquarter, boosted by robust net issuance of CMBS.  Although delinquency ratesfor commercial mortgages on the books of financial institutions remained low,overall CMBS delinquencies continued to rise, reaching a level last seen in1996.  According to the responses to the January Senior Loan Officer OpinionSurvey, the differential trends in delinquency rates reflect the inclusion ofhigher-risk debt in the CMBS pools and the fact that securitized mortgages aremore difficult to refinance.  Despite the rising delinquency rate, CMBS yieldsdeclined notably in early January, leaving spreads over swaps down about10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  The spread between BBB-ratedCMBS and BBB-rated corporate debt was narrowed slightly during that time.  
Household Finance
Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate home mortgages have fallen about35 basis points since the last FOMC meeting, a bit more than longer-termTreasury yields.  The decrease in rates will likely cause mortgage refinancing topick up in January. Purchase volume has remained strong, and home mortgagedebt is estimated to have grown at a robust 11-1/2 percent annual rate in thefourth quarter, just a shade below its third-quarter pace.  Meanwhile, consumercredit is estimated to have grown at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarterof last year, down slightly from its third-quarter pace of about 6 percent.

Household credit quality has been stable to improving over the fourth quarter. 
Seasonally adjusted delinquency rates on credit-card-backed securities declinedin October, and those on auto loans remained low in November.  Householdbankruptcy filings stabilized over the fourth quarter, albeit at still-elevatedlevels.
Sizable stock price gains produced an increase in the ratio of household assets to
disposable income in the fourth quarter.  To date there has been little evidencethat news of investigations into mutual fund trading practices has prompted apullback by mutual fund investors.  In December and the first half of January,households continued to pour money into long-term mutual funds.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross municipal bond issuance was robust in December, keeping fourth-quarterissuance about in line with the rapid third-quarter pace.  New capital issuancewas particularly strong last month, fuel ed by strong infrastructure demands and
borrowing to cope with remaining fiscal pressures. 
Yields on longer-term municipal bonds moved down about in line with Treasury
yields over the intermeeting period.  The revenue-bond credit spread fell furtherand is now at a level last seen in 2002.  In addition, for last year as a whole, thenet balance of upgrades to downgrades of municipal bonds improved noticeably. 
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury conducted its regularly scheduled auctions of two-, five-, and ten-year nominal securities and a ten-year inflation-indexed security over theintermeeting period.  The results from the auctions were mixed.  The five-yearnote auction met strong demand.  However, the TIPS auction the next day—thelargest since the inception of the program in 1997—was quite weak, with a stop-out rate an unusually wide 5 basis points above the when-issued rate. 
On December 22, the Federal Reserve released a widely anticipated staff
working paper that argued that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac benefit greatlyfrom an implied government subsidy but pass along little of that benefit to homebuyers.  Although the paper’s findings received extensive coverage in themedia, there was little immediate effect on GSE stock prices or yield spreads.
Money and Bank Credit
M2 fell at almost a 2 percent annual rate in December, the fourth consecutivemonthly decline.  The decline in M2 for the fourth quarter was also about

confidential until their release, which is planned for January 29th.2 percent, the largest since the start of consistent data collection in 1959.1  The
drop in M2 in December reflected additional weakness in liquid deposits, aswell as continued shrinkage in small time deposits and retail money marketmutual funds.  Households continued to shift into equity mutual funds and, inDecember, also moved into bond funds. The boost to liquid deposits earlier inthe year owing to the effects of mortgage refinancing activity was substantiallyunwound during the fourth quarter.  Howeve r, abstracting from special factors,
underlying M2 growth last quarter appears weak.
Bank credit declined at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate in December, as securities
and loans contracted.  Business lending continued to fall in November andDecember, with weakness again concentrated at large domestic and foreign-related institutions.  However, on net, respondents to the January Senior LoanOfficer Survey noted a pickup in demand for business loans over the past threemonths and also indicated that they had experienced an increase in the numberof inquiries from potential business borrowers during that time.   Preliminaryreports from a sample of bank holding companies indicate that the bankingsector remained highly profitable in the fourth quarter of 2003 and that creditquality also continued to improve.
Appendix
January 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
The January 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months.  In addition, the survey contained a series ofquestions on commercial real estate lendi ng; banks were asked about longer-term
changes in terms on commercial real estate lo ans, the types of properties used to secure
these loans, and commercial real estate loan  securitizations.  Responses were received
from fifty-three domestic and twenty foreign banking institutions.
Moderate net fractions of both domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks indicated that they had eased  lending standards and several lending terms
on C&I loans over the past three months.  Lending standards on commercial real estateloans over the same period were little change d.  After reporting declining demand for
C&I loans for the past three years, domes tic banks, on net, indicated in the January
survey that loan demand from firms of all sizes had strengthened.  By contrast, foreigninstitutions continued to report weaker C& I loan demand on net.  Both domestic and
foreign institutions reported stronger demand for commercial real estate loans, on net,
over the past three months. 
Small net fractions of domestic banks indicat ed that they had tightened some terms on
credit card loans, but standards and term s on other household loans were reportedly
unchanged.  A sizable net percentage of ba nks experienced weaker demand for loans to
purchase homes over the past three months, and a number of institutions indicated thatdemand for all types of consumer loans had declined over the same period.
Lending to Businesses
In the January survey, 17 percent of domes tic banks, on net, reported that they had
eased their lending standards on C&I loans for large and middle-market firms over thepast three months, the largest reported ne t easing of credit policies since the third
quarter of 1993.  In addition, 12 percent of  domestic banks, on net, indicated that they
had eased standards on loans for small firms.  Similarly, a moderate fraction of U.S.branches and agencies of foreign banks re ported an easing of lending standards on C&I
loans over the past three months.
In addition to easing their credit standard s on C&I loans, commercial banks reported
easing a number of terms on such loans over the past three months.  On net, about25 percent of domestic banks indicated that th ey had narrowed the spreads of loan rates
over their cost of funds for large and middle-market borrowers, up from 14 percent inthe October survey.  Domestic banks also continued to trim spreads on business loans
for small borrowers.  About 15 percent of fo reign institutions, on net, noted that they
had narrowed spreads on C&I loans, compared with no change in the previous survey.
For the first time since the fourth quarter of 1998, when the survey began collecting
information on risk premiums, domestic banks , on net, reported that they had lowered
the premiums charged on riskier loans to larg e and middle-market firms.  Domestic and
foreign institutions, on net, continued to  report an easing of terms on credit lines,
including increased maximum sizes of such lines and lower costs. 
III-A-2
According to survey respondents, more-a ggressive competition from other banks and
nonbanks, as well as an improvement in the ec onomic outlook, were the most important
reasons behind their decisions to ease credit standards and terms on C&I loans over thepast three months.  More than 80 per cent of the domestic banks, and more than
70 percent of the foreign institutions, that re ported an easing of standards or terms in the
January survey cited more-aggressive competition as at least a somewhat importantreason for doing so.  Indeed, 39 percent of dom estic respondents indicated that this was
a very important reason.  About 75 percen t of domestic institutions that eased their
lending policies pointed to a more fa vorable economic outlook.  Among domestic
institutions that reported a tightening of standards and terms on C&I loans, a reduced
tolerance for risk was the most freque ntly cited reason for having done so. 
C&I loan demand.   For the first time since early 2000, domestic survey respondents
noted that the demand for C&I loans had st rengthened.  About 25 percent of domestic
banks, on net,  reported increased demand for C&I loans from small firms, and11 percent, on net, reported stronger demand from large and middle-market firms.  In
the October survey, 2 percent of domestic ba nks, on net, indicated weaker loan demand
from small firms, and 8 percent, on net,  reported weaker demand from large and
middle-market borrowers.  The apparent turnaround in reported loan demand over the
past three months was also reflected in a rising proportion of domestic respondents thatexperienced an increase in the number of  inquiries from potential business borrowers:
37 percent of domestic institutions, on ne t, reported an increase in the number of
inquiries in the January survey, up from 18 percent in October and 10 percent in theAugust survey. However, foreign institutions continued to report a deterioration in C&I
loan demand. 
According to domestic respondents, the most  important reasons for the strengthening of
loan demand over the past three months were  increased customer investment in plant
and equipment and increased customer n eeds to finance accounts receivable and
inventories.  Of the domestic banks that experienced a decline in demand, about two-
thirds indicated that it was due in part to  an increase in their customers’ internally
generated funds, and two- thirds also attributed the declin e in part to a shift in their
customers’ borrowing to another bank or a nonbank credit source.  Branches andagencies of foreign banks cited the same reasons as domestic banks for decreased C&I
loan demand.
Commercial real estate lending.  As in the previous survey, domestic banks, on net,
reported essentially no change in their le nding standards on commercial real estate
loans in the January survey.  On the demand side, more than 20 percent of domesticbanks, on net, reported that the demand for commercial real estate loans had increasedover the past three months, a turnaround from the October survey, when about10 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported weaker demand for such loans. 
More than one-fifth of foreign institutions , on net, also reported stronger demand for
commercial real estate loans in the January  survey, whereas they reported no net change
in demand in the previous survey.
Special questions asked banks about chang es in terms on commercial real estate loans
over the past year.  About 20 percent of dom estic banks, on net, reported that they had
increased the maximum size of the commercial real estate loans that they are willing to
III-A-3
extend, and 12 percent, on net, indicated that they are willing to provide longer
maturities on these loans.  Most other lending terms on commercial real estate loanswere little changed, on net, in 2003.  Am ong domestic institutions that eased lending
terms, the most frequently cited reasons for doing so were more-aggressive competition
from other commercial banks or nonbank lenders  and an improvement in the condition
of, or outlook for, the commercial real estate market. 
In responses to a special question about what types of real estate secured nonfarm,
nonresidential commercial real estate loans, domestic banks indicated that officebuildings were used as collateral for about 30 percent of these loans, retail
developments for about 20 percent, and i ndustrial properties for nearly 15 percent. 
More than  40 percent of nonfarm, nonresidential commercial real estate loans held byforeign institutions were secured by office pr operties.  In addition to retail properties,
hotel and resort properties also figured prominently in the commercial real estateportfolios of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.
The January survey also asked several ques tions about the securitization of commercial
real estate loans.  More than three-fourth s of domestic and half of foreign respondents
indicated that less than 5 percent of all commercial real estate loans that their bank
originated over the past year had been securitized.  However, two domesticbanks—accounting for a tiny fraction of commercial real estate loans held by domesticrespondents—and four foreign institutions re ported that they had securitized more than
one-half of the year’s originations.  Both  foreign and domestic institutions noted that
the credit quality of commercial real estat e loans that they had securitized was
comparable to the credit quality of loans th at they had originated and held on their
books.  The vast majority of banks also indicated that they generally do not retainservicing rights or provide credit enhancements such as recourse on the commercial realestate loans they securitize.
Since mid-2002, delinquency rates on commercial real estate loans held by banks and
life insurance companies have been stable  or falling, while those on loans backing
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have been rising.  About 90 percent ofdomestic and about 60 percent of foreign r espondents attributed the divergence in the
delinquency rates to the tranching structures of CMBS facilities, which facilitate theinclusion of higher-risk mortgages in the CMBS pools; the second most frequently citedreason was that securitized mortgages are less lik ely to be refinanced than those held on
banks’ balance sheets.  This reasoning is c onsistent with the May 2003 survey in which
respondents indicated that the most important reason for the low delinquency rates onthe commercial real estate loans they held w as the ability of borrowers to refinance and
lower their debt financing costs as interest rates declined.
Lending to Households
Credit demand from households reportedly weakened over the past three months.  Onnet, more than one-third of domestic banks  indicated that the demand for residential
mortgage loans to purchase homes had deterior ated, a significantly greater share than in
the October survey.  However, respondents may find it difficult to separate mortgageoriginations used to buy homes from those u sed to refinance existing mortgages, and
the pace of refinancing has slowed considerably since the middle of last year.  About
III-A-4
15 percent of banks, on net, reported weaker  demand for consumer loans of all types
over the past three months, the largest net percentage reporting such weakening since
the fourth quarter of 2001.   
As for supply, respondents indicated that th ey had not changed their lending standards
on residential mortgages, on net, and that their lending policies for credit card and other
consumer loans were also largely unchanged.   However, a moderate fraction of banks
reported that they had decreased the extent  to which credit card accounts are granted to
customers who do not meet credit-scoring thresholds.

U.S. International Transactions
Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. international trade deficit in  November shrank to $38 billion, its lowest
level since about one year ago.
The value of exports of goods and serv ices increased 2.9 percent in November,
returning to a level not recorded sin ce early 2001.  The rise was driven by a
sharp increase in capital goods exports, largely coming from the volatilecategory of aircraft.  Exports of agri cultural products and consumer goods also
posted sizable increases.  In contrast , exports of automotive products and
industrial supplies declined.  Services  receipts rose 1.4 percent from October
levels.  At an annual rate, the average for October and November of the value of
exported goods and services was 23 per cent above the average for the third
quarter.  The increase was spread across all major categories, with notableincreases in industrial supplies, aircraft, and other capital goods.
The value of imports of goods and se rvices fell 0.8 percent in November,
following two monthly increases; the level, however, re mained above the
September figure.  About two-thirds of  the decline resulted from a drop in the
volume of imported oil.  Imports of consumer goods and non-oil industrial
supplies declined modestly, with little change in other categories.  Servicespayments rose 1.5 percent from October le vels.  At an annual rate, the average
for October and November of the valu e of imported goods and services was
about 13 percent above the average for the third quarter, the largest such increase
this year and more than twice the pace recorded in the third quarter. Double-digit increases were recorded  for capital goods, automotive products,
consumer goods, and food.  Oil im ports, on the other hand, declined.

Prices of Internatio nally Traded Goods
Non-oil imports.  In December, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and
of core goods rose 0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively.  Within core goods, the
largest price increase, 0.8 percent, was for industrial supplies, reflecting higher
prices for metals.  Prices for foods, f eed and beverages rose 0.7 percent, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase.  Prices of capital goods (excluding
computers and semiconductors) increased 0.2 percent.  Prices for automotive
products and consumer goods were unchanged in December.  The prices of U.S.
imports of computers and semiconductors continued to  decline in December. 
For the fourth quarter overall, the pri ces for imported core goods rose at an
annual rate of 1½ percent, fo llowing an increase of 1 percent in the third quarter. 
Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil rose  1.8 percent in December.  The spot
price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was also higher in December,averaging $32.10 per barrel, up around 3¼ percent from November.  The spot
price has averaged $34.30 per barrel thus far in January and closed at $35.78 per
barrel on January 20.  Oil prices have increased since early December owing in
part to declining oil inventories (particularly in the United States), recent coldweather, and an increase in natural ga s prices.  Strong economic activity, a
decline in the exchange value of the do llar, and a slow recovery of oil exports
from Iraq, where a lack of security remains a problem, are also keeping upwardpressure on oil prices.
Exports.   In December, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core
goods both increased 0.2 percent.  For the fourth consecutive month, prices of
agricultural products increased, rising 0.7 percent, owing to price increases for
feedstuff, soybeans, and wheat.  Prices  for exported industrial supplies rose 0.6
percent, reflecting higher prices for me tals and fuel oil.  For both consumer
goods and capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors), prices
edged up, whereas prices for automotive products fell slightly.  Following arevised 0.2 percent increase in November, the prices of exported computers rose
another 0.9 percent.  In December, pr ices for semiconductors fell 0.3 percent. 
For the fourth quarter, the prices of expor ted core goods rose at an annual rate of
5¼ percent, after an increase of 1 percent in the third quarter. 
U.S. Current Account through 2003:Q3
The U.S. current account deficit was $540.2 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter
of 2003, down from $557.6 billion in the sec ond quarter (revised).  The deficits
in goods and services trade and in othe r income and transf ers shrank modestly,
and the surplus in investment income increased slightly.
The deficit on goods and services narro wed $11.5 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the third

goods rose 8.8 percent, and the va lue of exported services moved up
21.2 percent.  The increases in both expor ts and imports of services largely
reflected a rebound in travel, though most other categories also showed
increases.
The surplus on net investment income increased in the third quarter to
$15.3 billion (s.a.a.r.), with income r eceipts on U.S.-owned assets abroad
increasing more than income payments on foreign-owned assets in the UnitedStates.  The increase in receipts owed primarily to an increase in directinvestment.  The increase in payments  was almost entirely accounted for by
increases in “other” payments.

U.S. International Fi nancial Transactions
Private foreign demand for U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transacti ons table) rebounded strong ly in November after
substantial weakness in Se ptember and October.  The $50 billion in private
foreigners' purchases of U.S. securities in the month was the most since May;
IV-7
demand for Treasury securities and equities rebounded a nd inflows into
corporate bonds, which were strong th roughout the year, surged.  Foreign
official inflows (line 1) continued to  be quite strong, amounting to $24 billion. 
In November, U.S. investors on balance sold foreign securities (line 5) for thefirst time since June, as sales of fore ign equities exceeded modest purchases of
foreign bonds.  In all, net private inflow s through securities (line 4 plus line 5)
and foreign official inflows combined  to total $78 billion in November, the
largest monthly amount since May.
The robust foreign official inflows of $24 billion in November  owed primarily to
Japanese exchange market interventi on.  Evidence from Federal Reserve Bank
of New York custody accounts suggests even  larger official inflows in December
and January; over the six-week pe riod from end-November through
mid-January, custody holdings increased $62 billion.  More than half of this
increase owed to further Japanese accumulation, but holdings by China and
Russia also increased substantially.
U.S. investors' modest net sales of foreign securities in November owed
primarily to net sales of equities through the United Kingdom, the euro area,and, reversing a recent trend, Taiwanes e equities.  At the same time, U.S.
investors purchased a substantial amount  of Hong Kong bonds (owing to a
record dollar-denominated bond issuance)  and continued to purchase Japanese
equities (bringing year-to-date purchases  of Japanese equ ities to $32 billion). 
Private foreign investment in U.S. securities in November came primarily fromEurope and financial centers  in the Caribbean; in addition, private investors from
Asia purchased a substantial amount of  U.S. debt securities in the month.
Through November, year-to-date foreign net private purchases of U.S. securities
totaled $322 billion, somewhat below th e record pace of 2002, and net U.S.
purchases of foreign securities tota led $58 billion, a relatively modest amount
but a large swing from the net sales in  2002.  The modest slowdown in private
inflows into U.S. securities and the resumption of U.S. purchases of foreignsecurities imply that U.S. net private por tfolio inflows through securities slowed
to $264 billion through November, a pace th at is well below the previous year's
record of $422 billion.  Foreign official inflows picked up the slack, totaling a
record $181 billion through November, double the robust inflows of 2002. 
The highly volatile banking sector (line 3) saw sizeable net inflows of $51
billion in October and $41 billion in November.
Third-quarter balance of payments data were released in mid-December.  Net
outflows of direct investment, modest in the first half of the year, increased in
the third quarter, as U.S. direct inves tment abroad (line 6) continued at its
elevated pace and foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7) slowed. 
IV-8
The slowing in foreign direct investment in the United States owed entirely to a
shift in inter-company debt (from a U.S. a ffiliate to its foreig n parent) that was
partially offset by increases in equity i nvestment and retained  earnings.  Through
the first three quarters, net direct i nvestment outflows (line 6 plus line 7)
amounted to $37 billion, following $98 billion in net outflows in 2002.  
The statistical discrepancy was pos itive $12.5 billion in the third quarter,
implying that the current account deficit slightly exceed repor ted net financial
inflows.  Data for the first two months  of the fourth quarter–incomplete and
subject to revision–suggest that the four th quarter discrepa ncy will be negative;
recorded net financial infl ows (the sum of lines 1 - 5) for October and November
total $174 billion, far greater than recen t quarterly current account deficits.

Foreign Financial Markets
The major currencies index of the dollar’s  exchange value has declined about 
1¾ percent since the December FOMC meeting, led by a 5¼ percentdepreciation of the dollar against sterling and a 3 percent depreciation against the
euro.  During the period, the dollar reached  an all-time low against the euro (a 7-
year low versus the implied Deutsch mark),  and fell to levels not seen since 1992
against sterling.  Against the Swiss franc, the dollar lost nearly 2 percent, while,on balance, the dollar was little changed against the Canadian dollar and the yen.
Ongoing concerns over investor willingn ess to finance the U.S. current account
deficit at current exchange rates were again a primary factor exerting pressure onthe dollar.  After declining modestly in  the first few weeks of the period, the
dollar’s rate of depreciation picked up in the second half of December as the
U.S. government raised the terror aler t level and announced a confirmed case of
“mad cow disease” (Bovine Spongiform En cephalopathy) in the United States. 
The dollar registered further sharp losses against all major foreign currencies inthe first weeks of the new year as U.S.  employment data disappointed markets
and official commentary suggested that, w ith inflation currently contained in the
United States, U.S. monetary authorities are unlikely to adjust interest rates inresponse to recent currency movements.  Late in the period, the dollar retraced
much of its losses against major fore ign currencies following stronger-than-
expected U.S. consumer confidence data  and as statements by numerous euro-
IV-11
area officials prompted speculation that European authorities might soon
intervene in currency markets or adjust interest rates to offset the effects of theeuro’s recent “brutal” appreciation.
The dollar was little changed against the yen on balance over the period.  There
was little market reaction to the Bank of Ja pan’s decision to raise its target range
for reserves on January 20.  The Bank of Japan intervened in currency markets
frequently during the period, purchasin g an exceptionally large quantity of
dollars on behalf of the Ministry of Fi nance.  The amount of dollars purchased
daily by the BoJ soared during the first full week of the new year, as marketparticipants described the dollar-yen market as largely one-sided, with the Bankof Japan taking the buy side of a larg e number of dollar transactions.  In mid-
January, the MoF exhausted its formal budgetary authority to borrow yen forintervention purposes and drew ¥5 trilli on from its ¥10 trillion foreign exchange
swap facility with the Bank of Japan in order to be able to continue itsoperations.  This swap facility was se t up formally in the second half of
December.  It is set to expire once the Diet approves on the government’srequest for a supplemental budget, which c ontains a provision to raise the MoF’s
intervention-related borrowing authority by ¥21 trillion for the remainder of the
2003/2004 fiscal year and anot her ¥40 trillion thereafter. 
The policy setting bodies of the Europ ean Central Bank and Bank of England
left their respective policy rates unchanged at meetings in early January.  Whilethere was little immediate market reacti on to the widely anticipated ECB
decision, market expectations for the path of short-term euro interest rates have,
on balance, shifted down 10 to 35 basis points over the period and now reflect a
greater likelihood that the ECB will lo wer rates or postpone future rate
increases.  In addition to market expect ations that the euro’s appreciation may
affect the interest rate decisions of the ECB, moderately disappointing data on
economic confidence and surveys of purchasing managers in the euro areacontributed somewhat to the decline in euro futures rates.  
Expectations for the path of interest  rates in the United Kingdom have also
shifted back since the last FOMC meeting.  Sterling futures rates declined inresponse to lower-than-expect ed U.K. inflation data as well as the BoE decision
to leave rates unchanged at its January meeting–suggesting that a near-term rateincrease that had been previously pri ced into markets may now be a bit less
likely.  Although economic data from Ca nada during the pe riod were generally
positive, Canadian interest rates fell in anticipation of the Bank of Canada’sdecision to cut its policy rate on January 20
th.  As had generally been expected,
the BoC cited the negative effects of th e strength of the Canadian dollar on
export growth in its statement.  After depreciating against the Canadian dollar
for much of the period, the dollar revers ed these losses in the weeks surrounding
IV-12
the BoC decision and following news  of a much-smaller-than-expected
Canadian trade surplus.   
Yields on long-term euro-area and U.K. g overnment debt declined 15 to 20 basis
points on net, inline with the decline in  U.S. Treasury yields, while Canadian
long-term yields declined somewhat mo re.  Country-specific economic data had
only marginal influence on most fore ign industrial economy bond markets, as
the largest declines in yields came a mid sharp drops in Treasury yields in
response to U.S. news, and the U.S. Decem ber employment repor t in particular.  
Major global equity markets saw strong net gains over the intermeeting period
on optimism about the global recovery.  Eu ro-area and Canadian equity markets
registered gains of 7 and 8 percent, re spectively,  while the broad U.K. index
gained about 4 percent on net.  Shares of automobile corporations, which are
typically more sensitive to currency moves, underperformed in European
markets relative to their U.S. counterpart s and broader European  equity indexes. 
The broad Japanese equity index gained  about 8 percent over the period, led by
gains in the real estate and shipping  industry.  Japanese banking shares
registered gains of about 6 percent.  
IV-13
Financial market conditions in emer ging market econo mies have generally
improved since the December FOMC.  Many currencies in the index of thedollar’s value against the currencies of our  other important tr ading partners have
gained, with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real up 3 and 3½ percent,
respectively, against the dollar, and th e Taiwan dollar up 1¼ percent.  Equity
markets in emerging Asian economies have  seen gains on the order of 5 to 20
percent, supported by conti nued improvement in exports and in the face of a so
far limited re-emergence of SARS.  Major Latin America equity markets madesimilar gains as investors either assessed that the level of risk had decreased inlight of the ongoing global economic recovery or their appetite for riskincreased.  Potentially also contributing to equity gains in Brazil and Mexico,monetary conditions eased over the peri od in these economies, with short-term
rates now about 120 and 80 ba sis points lower, respectiv ely.  As had generally
IV-14
been expected, the central bank of Braz il lowered its policy rate 100 basis points
on December 17.

Developments in Forei gn Industrial Countries
Recent data indicate that the pickup in economic activity in the major foreign
industrial countries continue d in the fourth quarter.  Japanese exports, machinery
orders, and industria l production rose strongly.  De spite the euro’s appreciation,
euro-area manufacturing data exhibited increasing strength, particularly in
Germany.  Data releases in the Unite d Kingdom have generally been mixed, but
business and retail sales indicators in December point to a maintainedexpansion.  Canadian employment and sa les data were str ong in the fourth
quarter, with the housing sector continuing  to make a significant contribution to
growth.     
Consumer price inflation has been low and stable. Twelve-month core inflation
in Canada remained at 1.8 percent, a nd twelve-month consumer price inflation
in the euro area rose marginally to 2.1 percent, slightly above the ECB’s 2
percent ceiling.  The twelve month change in the Bank of England’s newtargeted measure of inflation, the cons umer prices index, was 1.3 percent in
November.  Mild defla tion continued in Japan. 
The Bank of Japan and the Bank of Cana da both eased monetary policy at the
end of the period.  The Bank of Japan rais ed its target for the balance of current
accounts held at the bank by roughly 10 pe rcent in a move it said was aimed at
ensuring an economic recovery and reaffirming its determination to eliminatedeflation.  Citing  recent appreciation of  the Canadian dollar and its impact on
growth, the Bank of Canada decreased th e targeted overnight rate by 25 basis
points  to 2.5 percent.
In Japan , indicators suggest that the econom y expanded strongly in the fourth
quarter.  Real exports surged in Oc tober and November, boosted by buoyant
growth in emerging Asia, while imports  rose somewhat.  Industrial production
for October and November was on av erage up about 3½ percent from the
third-quarter average.  The broader all-industries index rose ¾ percent in
October.  Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed
investment, were on average up 10 percen t in October and November from the
third-quarter average.  However, pr ivate consumption remained sluggish. 
Household expenditures in October and N ovember were only s lightly above the
third-quarter average, while new car regi strations fell 2 per cent during the fourth
quarter.
The Bank of Japan’s Tankan index of business conditions rose in December,
with the level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment amongfirms of all sizes and across all i ndustries increasing to -15 from -21 in
IV-16
September.  However, survey respondents projected a slight decline in the index,
to -17, for March.  The improvement in  the aggregate index in December was
broadly based, with increases for both manufacturers a nd nonmanufacturers
across nearly all firm sizes.

goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy)
were unchanged in December from the previous month but were down 0.1percent from a year earlier.  Deflation at the wholesale price level easedsignificantly in December, in part  reflecting a jump in food prices.

On January 20, the Bank of Japan raised  its target range for the outstanding
balance of bank accounts held at the BOJ to ¥30-35 trillion from its previous 
range of ¥27-32 trillion.  In an accompanying statement, the Bank noted that"Japan's economy is recovering gradually " but cited several concerns, including
continued structural problems, declinin g consumer prices, and developments in
foreign exchange markets.
The Cabinet recently approved th e budget for FY2004 (April 2004-March
2005).  Expenditures will rise 0.4 percen t (about 0.1 percent of GDP) relative to
last year’s initial budget, re flecting swelling social secu rity and debt servicing
costs.  Many other spending programs were cut.  Tax revenues are projected to
be roughly unchanged.  As a result, th e budget will require a small increase in
new bond issuance for FY2004 to ¥36.6 trillion.
In the euro area , recent data suggest that real GDP continued to strengthen in
the fourth quarter.  Industrial produc tion surged in October, and German
production in October and November ro se on average almost 2½ percent above
its third quarter level.  The euro-ar ea purchasing managers index (PMI) for
manufacturing remained above  50 (the threshold indicating expansion).  The
increase in the German PMI for manufact uring was particul arly strong.  In
addition, the volume of German manufactur ing orders in October and November
was nearly 4 percent over the third-quarter  average.  Trade data in October and
November suggest a mild decline in exports and a slight increase in importsfrom third-quarter levels.  However, foreign orders  for German manufacturing
goods rose in November, indicating that the drag from the rise of the euro has
not fully offset the stimulus from an increase in foreign demand.
Twelve-month consumer pri ce inflation remained above the ECB’s 2 percent
ceiling in December.  Sharp increases in  food prices put considerable upward
pressure on headline inflation.  The sharp appreciation of the euro has helped to
offset the recent increase in dollar-de nominated oil prices. Core inflation,
excluding energy and unprocessed food, has hovered between 1.8 percent and 2
percent for most of 2003.

On balance, data for the fourth quart er suggest continued expansion in the
United Kingdom .  In November consumer  confidence ticked down and
industrial production more than retraced  its October spurt.  In December,
however, the manufacturing PMI climbed to a four-year high and businessconfidence strengthened.  Although the se rvices PMI fell back in December and
retail sales growth slowed in November , the trends in both series remained
robust, and one of the leading surveys of retail sales sugge sted substantial
December sales growth.
Private surveys suggested that the twel ve-month rate of inflation in housing
prices picked up in December to ar ound 16 percent, but the government’s
experimental index showed a rate just  below 10 percent for the twelve months
ending in November.  Household ne t mortgage and consumer borrowing
remained elevated in November.

On December 10, Chancellor of the Ex chequer Gordon Brown confirmed that
the Bank of England would adopt a 2 percent target for the twelve-month
growth rate of the consumer prices index (previously called the harmonized
index of consumer prices) effective imme diately.  The CPI target replaced the
2½ percent target for the retail price index excluding mortgage interestpayments (RPIX).   The twelve-mont h CPI rate stayed at 1.3 percent in
December, remaining below the target.  RPIX rose 2.6 percent in the twelve
months ending in December.  The Chancellor also revised upward hisprojections for Public Sector Net Bo rrowing (PSNB) to £37 billion for 2003-04
IV-20
(around 2½ percent of GDP) and £31 billi on for 2004-05.  The government kept
its real GDP growth forecasts for 2004 and 2005 at 3 to 3½ percent.
In Canada , employment increased 0.3 percent in December, marking the fourth
consecutive month of robust job gains a nd pushing the unemployment rate down
to 7.4 percent.  Employment growth has b een assisted by strength in the housing
sector, as both the construction and real estate service industries have
contributed significantly to the increas e in jobs.  Housing starts eased only
slightly in the fourth quarter fro m the third quarter’s 13-year high.
Other indicators for the fourth quarter have also been positive.  Real GDP by
industry in October was 0.7 pe rcent above its third-quarter  average, as the retail
and wholesale sectors both grew briskly.  October’s increase in retail sales came
despite a drop in domestic motor vehicle sales that extended through the quarter,
with sales near a five-year low in December.  The composite leading indicatorcontinued to move up in December, capping the largest quarterly increase in theindicator since early 2002
.  However trade data in November were weaker than
expected as the strong Canadian  dollar weighed on export growth.
In November, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation remained at 1.6
percent.  Twelve-month core inflati on, excluding food, energy, and indirect
taxes, remained at 1.8 percent for the third consecutive month.  On January 20,
the Bank of Canada decreased the targeted  overnight rate (its  key policy rate) 25
basis points , to 2.50 percent.  The Bank motivated the cut by citing the recent
rapid appreciation of the Ca nadian dollar, and its impact on Canadian growth, as
well as a subdued outlook for inflation a nd the existence of excess capacity in
Canadian economy.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Recent data releases in developing Asia  suggest that the rebound in growth has
continued, although generally at a slower pace than in the third quarter.  In Latin
America, incoming data indicate a con tinuation of the econo mic recoveries in
Argentina and Brazil, and there appear to  be some signs of revival in Mexico’s
industrial sector.   Infla tion has remained subdued in  most of the developing
world.  
Incoming data from the Chinese  economy continue to point to a robust pace of
expansion.  Real GDP grew 7.9 percen t in the fourth quarter, boosted by
investment and exports, a nd third-quarter real GDP  was revised upward (the
first time China has ever released revised quarterly GDP figures).  Exports wereboosted in December by a change in g overnment policy that will reduce tax
rebates to exporters starting in January .  The strong showing of exports in
December enhanced the trade surplus fo r 2003 as a whole.  Overall, the 2003
surplus narrowed a bit from 2002.  The handf ul of SARS cases that emerged in
early January give some cause of con cern about a possible recurrence of the
epidemic.  Deflation has become less of  a concern recently; continued increases
in food prices have helped boost tw elve-month inflation to 3 percent in
November.

In early January, the Chinese government revealed that at the end of 2003 it had
infused $45 billion of its foreign exchange  reserves as fresh capital into two of
its four large state banks.  Around mid -December, the People’s Bank of China
increased the maximum interest rate that commercial banks and urban creditcooperatives can charge on loans.  This  is generally seen as a step toward
IV-26
liberalization of interest rates and is  intended to move the banks away from
lending at a loss to state-owned enterp rises and toward mo re profitable lending
to the private sector.  Although these st eps are in the right direction, analysts
emphasize that much more needs to be  done to prepare Chinese banks to open
up fully to foreign competition, which China has committed to do by the end of
2006 as part of its WTO accession.
Data releases since the la st Greenbook suggest that the Hong Kong economy
has continued to grow, but not at the skyrocketing-pace of the third quarter,when the economy bounced back from the impact of SARS.  The growth ofretail sales appeared to slow in Novemb er, but the unemployment rate continued
to fall.  Tourist arrivals reached a new record high in October and roughly stayed
at that elevated level in November.  The property sector has also continued to
show signs of revival.  Both exports  and imports expande d in November, with
total trade—a good indicator of economic  activity for Hong Kong’s entrepot
economy—rising about 5 percent from the previous month.  With growth inimports outpacing that in exports, however, the trade deficit widened
considerably in November.  Twelve-m onth consumer price inflation remained
negative in November, but the rate of deflation continued to slow.

In Taiwan , economic activity has remained buoyant.  I ndustrial production was
up strongly in the fourth quarter.  Driven by high-tech output, production
reached new record highs in the quarter.  The unemployment rate continued todecline in November.  Exports, particular ly in the high-tech sector, continued to
expand, rising nearly 6 percent in the four th quarter.  But with imports surging a
surprising 15 percent in the quarter, ther e was a considerable narrowing of the
trade surplus.  Export orders remained sturdy, posting a gain of about 13 percent
IV-27
in November from their year-earlier levels.  Consumer price inflation remained
negative in the closing months of 2003, c ontributing to slight deflation for the
year as a whole.

Data releases since the last Greenbook s how that strong exports, mainly high-
tech products and automobiles, have c ontinued to be the main contributor to
growth in Korea , whereas consumption and inves tment remain w eak.  Industrial
production declined slightly in Novemb er but remained 5 percent above the
average level in the third quarter.  Wholesale and retail trade and equipmentinvestment decreased in November, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.5
percent in December.  Bolstered by strong exports, the trade surplus widenedfurther in November, and consumer and business sentiment continued toimprove in December.  Twelve-month c onsumer price inflation was unchanged
at 3.4 percent in December.    On January 8, the Bank of Korea announced a target range of 2.5 to 3.5 percentfor the average rate of core inflati on for the three-year period 2004-2006.  The
liquidity problems faced by credit card companies re-emerged early in the newyear, with LG Card, the largest credit card company in Korea, halting cashadvances on January 8.  The firm’s la rge private and state-owned creditors
subsequently announced that they w ould provide a 5 trillion won (4.2 billion
dollar) bailout package to the firm.

Although Thailand’s GDP rel ease added to other indica tions of robust growth in
the third quarter, more recent indicators from the ASEAN  region have painted a
moderation of activity.  Singapore’ s industrial production contracted in
November, largely due to the volatile  pharmaceutical sect or, but high-tech
production remained strong.   After positive performance in October, industrial
production in Malaysia and Th ailand softened in Novemb er.  In general, trade
surpluses were large across the region in November as imports fell more thanexports.  In December, Singapore’s tr ade surplus almost doubled as rising
imports were outpaced by surging expor ts.  Inflation in the ASEAN countries
remained low, with Indonesia substantia lly reducing inflati on over the course of
2003.

In Mexico, there have been some recent sign s of a revival in the industrial
sector.  Average industrial production over October and N ovember was about
1¼ percent higher than in the third quarter, and manufact uring output was up
about 1¾ percent over the same period.  Exports, which are heavily weighted
toward manufacturing, rose at a monthly rate of over 2 percent in each of thetwo months of October and November, also suggestive of improving conditions
in the manufacturing sector.  However,  overall economic ac tivity (a monthly
proxy for real GDP) remained lacklust er, posting only a modest ¼ percent gain
in October.  Despite some acceleration of  consumer prices at the end of last
year, inflation remains under contro l; twelve-month inflation came in at
4 percent in December, exactly at th e upper bound of the Bank of Mexico’s 2-
4 percent target range.  
In late December, the Mexican congre ss approved an austere government budget
for this year which calls for the total pub lic sector deficit to  fall from 0.6 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2004.  Because President Fox’s tax
reform proposals to boost government re venues were rejected by the congress,
the newly approved budget entails more re straint in government spending than
was originally envisaged by the admin istration.  However, the macroeconomic
assumptions underlying the budget projecti ons are fairly conservative, especially
for oil prices, creating some possibility of windfall revenues if oil prices remainhigh.

In Brazil , data releases generally pain t a picture of continued economic
recovery.  Industrial produc tion rose in November and was up 7½ percent from
its recent trough in mid-2002.  The gr owth of capital goods production was
particularly strong, providi ng additional evidence of recovery in investment. 
Private consumption has been the sl owest component of demand to show
recovery, but domestic auto sales did rise sharply in the fourth quarter. 
Unemployment remains high.  Brazil con tinued to record strong export growth,
reflecting in part higher commodity pr ices and in part the response to the
country’s improved international competitiveness in recent years.
Prompted by the continued favorable inflation trends and still-weak private
consumption, the central bank reduced its overnight interest rate by 100 basis
points in mid-December to 16½ percent.  This rate is well below the 26½
percent rate that preva iled in June of last year.  Average 12-month-ahead
expected inflation from the central bank’s survey has remained at 6 percent inrecent months.  Responding to favorab le financial cond itions, the Brazilian
government retired $13 billion in dollar- linked instruments issued domestically
in the second half of 2002.

In Argentina , recent data releases confir m that the economic recovery
continues.  Real GDP rose 11.7 percent at  an annual rate in the third quarter, on
the back of strong agricultural exports  and rising consum er demand, although it
remains below pre-crisis  levels.  Industrial pr oduction was up 3.7 percent in
November.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation remained low in December,at 3.8 percent.  The Argentine peso, which appreciated 15 percent in 2003, has
strengthened about 2 percent since the be ginning of the year.  Tax revenues have
also improved.  Argentina has met all of the quantitative criteria of its IMFprogram and has made some  advances in structural  reforms.  The country,
however, is lagging behind in its bank recapitalization efforts and has yet to
show that it is pursuing debt restructur ing negotiations with private creditors in
good faith.  The Argentine government’s  proposal of a 75 percent reduction in
principal presented last September received a negative reaction frombondholders. In early December, a c ounteroffer calling for a maximum
35 percent reduction in pr incipal was presented by a group of bondholders, but
the Argentine government has insisted on its original plan.

In Venezuela , indications are that economic activ ity continued to recover in the
fourth quarter, but the economy remain s weak.  Industria l production rose in
October, but stood 20 percent below its  recent peak in 2001.  Oil production is
still believed to be about 10 percent below the levels  prevailing before the
devastating December 2002 general strike .  Inflation ended the year at 27
percent, despite the fixed exchange rate  in effect since February 2003 and the
weakness of the economy.  President Chav ez, facing mounting pressure to hold
a recall referendum later this year, ha s been pressuring the central bank to
transfer a portion of its international rese rves to the government for development
projects.
