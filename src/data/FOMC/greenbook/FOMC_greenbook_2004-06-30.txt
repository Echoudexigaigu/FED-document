Overview
Economic activity likely registered another solid increase this quarter.  Althoughconsumer spending looks to have slowed a bit in recent months, higher levels ofhousing starts and home sales indicate a substantial step-up in residentialconstruction expenditures.  Bolstered by strong fundamentals, equipment andsoftware spending began the quarter on an upward trajectory.  Meanwhile, thelabor market has continued to bounce back, and factory output has acceleratedin the current quarter.  Driven in part by large increases in energy prices, top-line consumer price inflation has increased in recent months.  Core priceinflation has risen as well since the turn of the year, though the twelve-monthchange in core CPI prices is only a touch higher than over the comparable year-earlier period.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market is rebounding strongly.  Private nonfarm payrolls rose275,000 in May, after an increase of 325,000 in April.  Employment gains havebeen widespread; in May the six-month diffusion index of employment changesmoved up to 70.7, its highest level since April 2000.
1  Notably, after three and
one-half years of decline, manufacturers have added jobs in each of the past fourmonths.  Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers rose0.3 percent in May and now stands 2.0 percent above its trough of last summer.
In the last Greenbook, we noted that the improvement in the labor market to that
point was mainly due to a reduction in layoffs.  The more recent improvement,however, also reflects an expansion in hiring.  The hiring rate from the JobOpenings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) shot up to 3.5 percent in March,and, despite reversing some of that rise in April, the hiring rate stands wellabove the lows of last year.  Similarly, the decline in the exhaustion rate forunemployment insurance since the turn of the year is consistent with strongerhiring pulling individuals back into jobs before their benefits run out.  TheJOLTS job openings rate has also edged up since the end of last year.  
Despite the large increases in employment over the past several months,
significant slack appears to remain in the labor market.  In the household survey,the unemployment rate, at 5.6 percent in May, and the labor force participationrate, at 65.9 percent in May, have exhibited little movement since the start of theyear.  Indeed, the employment-to-population ratio, the movement of whichreflects changes in both the unemployment rate and the labor force participationrate, is still close to the low it reached last year.  Moreover, the proportion ofindividuals working part-time for economic reasons has been roughly flat at a

National Federation of Independent Businesses that they have a hard-to-fillposition open is currently only at the upper end of the low range it has occupiedsince late 2001, a reading that suggests that workers are not appreciably hard tofind.  Household perceptions of the labor market, as reported in the ConferenceBoard survey, also support the view that the labor market has ample room forexpansion.  Survey respondents’ assessments of current labor market conditionswere about unchanged in May and remain below the level at the trough of therecent recession.  
Looking ahead, the level of initial claims through the middle of June continues
to point to a strong gain in employment; the four-week moving average for theweek ending June 12 was 343,000.  The hiring plans of small businesses, asreported by the National Federation of Independent Businesses survey, havebeen unchanged, on net, over the past several months, albeit at a level wellabove their trough.  Similarly, Manpower Inc.’s index of firms’ hiring plans forthe third quarter was unchanged at its highest level in three years.

3. To meet demand, John Deere, a maker of fa rm and construction machinery, is reportedly
planning to forgo its usual summer shutdown period,  and, similarly, Caterpillar is not planning to
temporarily idle any of its plants this summer.quarter.  However, this apparent acceleration reflects, in part, a large decline last
quarter in non-employee hours, which are volatile.  An alternative productivitymeasure, using the rate of increase in hours of all employees, rose at an annualrate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter, about the same rate as in 2003:Q4. 
Industrial Production
Total industrial production rose about 1 percent in both April and May, anoticeable step-up from the average monthly pace of 1/2 percent recordedduring the first quarter.  IP in the second quarter is on track to post a fourthconsecutive quarter of accelerating production.  In the past two months, outputat utilities surged, reflecting a turn in the weather from unusually mild in Marchto unseasonably warm in May, and manufacturing production excluding motorvehicles expanded sharply.  Motor vehicle assemblies were little changed inApril; in May they fell 450,000 units and subtracted 0.2 percentage point fromthe change in manufacturing output.  
Production in high-tech manufacturing industries rose smartly in May.  The
output of semiconductors and computers continued to post solid gains, and theproduction of communications equipment rose nearly 3-1/2 percent, more thanerasing the declines of the preceding three months.
Production gains elsewhere have been broad-based.  The pace of output of
consumer nondurables and business supplies, which had generally laggedproduction increases in other market groups, picked up in recent months, and theproduction of business equipment, which rose nearly 12 percent (annual rate) inthe first quarter, climbed again in April and May.
3  Materials output continued
the expansion that started in the second half of last year. 
For June, the limited available weekly data on physical output are down a bit on
net.  Although the production of iron, steel products, and coal has risen in thefirst half of this month, electricity generation has reversed some of the rise inMay.  More importantly, motor vehicle assemblies appear to have eased back inJune to 11-3/4 million units (annual rate), putting the average rate for the secondquarter at 12.0 million units.  Preliminary third-quarter schedules call for a12.1 million unit rate.  Despite robust sales in May, inventories of light trucksremain uncomfortably high, and as a result some automakers have extendedsummer downtime at a few plants by one week.

Indicators of production in high-tech industries remain positive.  Intel’s upward
revision to its second-quarter revenue guidance suggests solid near-termincreases in semiconductor output, and, according to Gartner, a consulting andresearch firm, semiconductor vendors are reporting strong orders.  Utilizationrates among semiconductor producers remain above 90 percent; despite adoubling of bookings for semiconductor manufacturing equipment relative to ayear ago, industry contacts are concerned about looming capacity constraints.Indeed, the latest Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing surveylisted several types of semiconductors as up in price, and semiconductors werenoted as being in short supply.  CIO Magazine’s diffusion indexes for futurespending on computer hardware and on networking equipment have continuedto rise, and orders as reported in the M3 for nondefense communicationsequipment surged in April.
Other forward-looking indicators for near-term manufacturing activity are
consistent with continued production increases.  The ISM new orders diffusionindex remained relatively high in May, and available regional indexes in Junepoint to further solid gains.  Smoothing through the substantial volatility in thestaff’s series on real adjusted durable goods orders, the three-month movingaverage increased a solid 1.3 percent in April.  
The recent sharp turnaround in manufacturing production has boosted the
factory operating rate to 76.4 percent in May.  Although the utilization rate hasrisen rapidly in the past six months, it remains 3-1/2 percentage points below its1977-2003 average.  The slack suggested by this measure stands in contrast tothe impression given by the ISM’s index of supplier delivery performance,which indicates widespread increases in lead times.  A similar gap between thetwo series opened up in the 1982-84 period, when the supplier deliveries indexshot up before the factory operating rate turned up.  In both cases, the gap

4.  The Federal Reserve’s capacity measure abstracts from these short-run constraints by
asking respondents to the Survey of Plant Capacity to assume that the requisite labor andmaterials are available. emerged when manufacturing began to rebound from a protracted and
substantial downturn and likely reflects short-run constraints of labor andmaterials on hand due to the cumulative declines in manufacturing employmentand inventories.
4   Indeed, similar cyclical considerations are likely behind the
significantly higher utilization rates found in the ISM’s recent SemiannualEconomic Forecast; consistent with our interpretation, manufacturers reportedthat they planned to relieve these pressures by working existing personnellonger hours and hiring more workers.  
Another factor contributing to lengthening supplier delivery lead times may be
tight capacity in the trucking industry.  Industry contacts and reports in theBeige Book indicate widespread driver shortages and a relatively low stock ofmedium and heavy trucks.  The Bureau of Transportation’s transportation indexfor freight volume has risen at an annual rate of 12 percent in the six monthsending in March (latest observation available).

Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles climbed 1.4 million units in May to an annual rate of17.8 million units, a blip-up that follows a sales pace of less than 16-1/2 millionunits in the first four months of the year.  More aggressive marketing tactics canaccount for only a small portion of the jump in sales in May.  Incentives on lightvehicles did move up after having been flat for several months, but the dollarvalue of the increase was modest.  In addition, fleet sales explain only130,000 units of the rise in sales.  This month, incentives have edged down, andautomakers expect light vehicle sales to drop back, with projections rangingfrom 16.0 to 16.4 million units. 
Our industry contacts have told us that high gasoline prices do not appear to
have significantly affected consumer behavior to date.  Despite their lower fuelefficiency, light trucks have increased their share of light vehicle sales, on net,in the past two months.  Although the market share of the sports utility segmenthas slipped this year, the decline follows a rapid increase in 2003, and the recentpullback is not out of line with historical variation in shares.  In the past threemonths, the number of respondents to the Michigan Survey of ConsumerSentiment who cited rising gasoline prices as a reason that motor vehicle buyingconditions are poor has risen from a negligible fraction to 8 percent. Nonetheless, personal finances and general economic conditions, rather thanconcerns about rising fuel costs, continue to be the dominant reported factorsaffecting consumers’ views of buying conditions.
Consumer Spending
Real personal consumption expenditures appear to have slowed a bit in thecurrent quarter.  In particular, purchases of goods excluding cars and trucksdeclined 0.3 percent in April.  Despite a large nominal increase in this categoryin May, we estimate that real spending was flat, as gasoline and food pricesincreased sharply. 
Real outlays on services moved up in April, the most recent month for which
data are available.  Spending on energy services increased in April with a returnto more normal temperatures from an unseasonably mild March; atypicallywarm weather in May likely pushed up spending further in this category. Expenditures on non-energy services, which rose briskly again in April, wereboosted largely by outlays for medical and brokerage services.
The economic fundamentals underlying consumption still look strong.  Gains in
equity values and house prices over the past year have boosted the net worth ofhouseholds.  Moreover, despite higher energy prices, real disposable personalincome has been rising rapidly so far this year, benefiting from an improvedlabor market and last year's tax cut.  With disposable income advancing faster

5. In its preliminary report on first-quarter  GDP, the BEA revised up its estimate of the
saving rate 0.2 percentage point in 2003:Q4 and 0.3 percentage point in 2004:Q1 because of
upward revisions to wages and salaries.than personal outlays since the end of last year, the saving rate has moved up
this year, reaching 2.4 percent in April.5
Consumer confidence also remains at favorable levels.  The Michigan SurveyResearch Center's index of consumer sentiment jumped in early June, more thanreversing its decline in the previous month, and the Conference Board index ofconsumer confidence held steady in May (the most recent reading).  The levelsof both indexes are well above their lows of early 2003.
Housing Markets
The pace of new homebuilding remained elevated in April and May.  Newsingle-family homes were started at annual rates of 1.62 million units in Apriland 1.64 million units in May, near the high end of the very strong recent rangeof activity.  Issuance of new permits to build single-family homes (adjusted foractivity in areas where permits are not required) was roughly in line with startslast month, suggesting that starts remained elevated in June.
In the more-volatile multifamily sector, starts fell about 10 percent in May to an
annual rate of 327,000 units, but the pace of new permit issuance points to arebound in starts this month.  Indeed, construction activity in this sector hasbeen surprisingly resilient in the past several months despite a vacancy rate formultifamily units that reached a record high of 11.4 percent in the first quarter. Low interest rates may have helped maintain the profitability of apartmentbuildings despite the higher vacancy rates.
Home sales remained strong in April, and prices continued to rise at a rapid rate. 
Sales of existing homes increased to an annual rate of 6.64 million units inApril, only a bit below the record pace set last September.  The average price ofan existing home sold in April was 9.8 percent higher than a year before, and therepeat-sales price index (which is less affected by the composition of homessold) was up 7.7 percent during the year ending last quarter.  In the muchsmaller market for new homes, sales dropped back in April from March’s recordlevel but remained elevated.  The average price of a new home sold in April was14 percent higher than a year before, and the quality-adjusted price index fornew homes (which controls for changes in some of the characteristics of homessold) was up 5.8 percent during the year ending in the first quarter. 
The recent run-up in mortgage rates has yet to have a noticeable effect on
housing activity.  The average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages in thefirst half of June was almost 85 basis points above the near-record low seen in

6. Many real estate practitioners think that an increase in mortgage rates that follows a long
decline in rates spurs many “fence sitters” to jump into the market.  While there is someevidence for a short-lived effect on the sale of existing homes, we cannot find a fence-sitter
effect for the construction or sale of new homes.  March; over the same period, the average rate for one-year adjustable-rate
mortgages rose about 65 basis points.  Housing activity normally lags changesin mortgage rates by one to two months.  Moreover, the recent jump in ratesmay be prompting some shoppers to bring forward their purchases to avoidpotentially higher rates later on.
6  Nonetheless, the most recent data from the
Mortgage Bankers Association—our most timely indicator of housing demand—show that purchase applications moved down a bit in the first half of June,which suggests that home-buying activity may ease this summer. 
Equipment and Software
Real outlays for equipment and software rose at an annual rate of 10 percent inthe first quarter and seem poised for a more rapid gain in the current quarter. Spending on transportation equipment, which dropped last quarter, appearslikely to make a strong showing, and business expenditures on other equipmentlook to be advancing at the same brisk pace as observed over the past year. More generally, the current business environment is favorable for capitalinvestment:  Business output is rising, co rporate coffers are flush with liquid
assets, financing costs are low, and the looming expiration of the partialexpensing tax provision gives firms an additional incentive to invest before theend of the year.  Surveys of business leaders and anecdotes from our industrycontacts also point to continued vigorous demand.
The recent orders and shipments data indicate that firms are investing in high-
tech equipment at a rapid clip.  In April, nominal shipments of computers andcommunications equipment jumped, and orders in both categories registeredsubstantial increases.  Favorable revenue guidance from major software vendorsis also consistent with buoyant activity in the high-tech sector.
Business spending on motor vehicles and aircraft seems likely to rebound in the
current quarter after dropping sharply in the first quarter.  Sales of light vehiclesto businesses appear to have moved up in the second quarter; this should offset adip in sales of medium and heavy trucks in April and May that is itself likely tobe temporary.  Tight capacity in the transportation industry and accelerateddepreciation schedules have stimulated a rise in orders for medium and heavytrucks to near record levels in April and May.  Real outlays on aircraft slumpedin the first quarter as airlines purchased fewer planes from foreignmanufacturers, but April trade data point to a bounceback in imports for thecurrent quarter.  The increase in imports will likely more than offset a decline indomestic shipments.

Nominal business spending on nonresidential structures posted its thirdconsecutive monthly increase in April but has yet to break out of the fairlynarrow range it has occupied for about a year and a half.  The recentperformance of the major types of construction has been mixed.  Nominalspending on office buildings and manufacturing structures fell in April, whileoutlays for commercial buildings—which include wholesale and retailestablishments—communications structures, and various other types ofbuildings moved up.

Other indicators of nonresidential construction also vary across sectors. Conditions in the office sector remain soft but show some signs of stabilizing. The office vacancy rate flattened out at a high level in the first quarter; rentscontinued to fall, albeit at a slower rate; and property values eked out modestincreases.  In the retail sector, low vacancy rates accompanied gains in rents andproperty values in the first quarter, but the rate of increase for property valuesmoved off the lofty levels seen late last year. An increase in the number ofnatural gas drilling rigs in operation through early June suggests that spendingon drilling and mining structures has likely risen in the past few months.   Incontrast, the vacancy rate for industrial space edged up further in the firstquarter. 
Business Inventories  
The pace of inventory accumulation has remained modest.  Although the bookvalue of manufacturing and trade inventories rose at an annual rate of$82 billion in the first quarter, more than half of that increase reflected risinginventory valuations.  A large gap between book-value and real measures ofinventory investment occurs when the prices of crude and manufactured goodsswing rapidly; in this case, a jump in the price of oil and a run-up in the pricesof intermediate materials explain the relatively large adjustment to the book-value data last quarter.  In April, the book value of stocks of manufacturing andtrade businesses rose at about the first-quarter pace, but we believe that most ofthis increase was also price related.

8. Specifically, we estimate that the effective tax rate, on a liability basis, fell from
10.7 percent in 2002 to 9.7 percent in 2003, less th an the 1.3 percentage-point drop that would
have been the result of the 2003 tax cut, all else being equal. Non-auto inventory-sales ratios appear to be below their trend levels.  In
addition, the staff’s flow-of-goods system, which measures inventories ofvarious products wherever held, indicates that days’ supply of all but a handfulof goods are below trend.  The ISM diffu sion index of customers’ inventories
slipped further in May to its lowest level since the inception of the index inmid-1995; almost one-third of respondents to the survey indicated that they feltthat their customers’ stocks were too low, while only a handful felt that theywere too high. 
Federal Government
The budget outlook is a bit less gloomy than it was earlier this year becausereceipts appear to have firmed somewhat in recent months.  The CongressionalBudget Office stated that fiscal 2004 receipts may be $30 billion to $40 billionhigher than it anticipated in March, while incoming data on outlays remainconsistent with the earlier forecast.
Receipts in April and May were little changed from a year earlier.  The revenue
effects of last year’s tax-cut legislation seem to have been offset by highertaxable incomes and an upside surprise in the average effective tax rate appliedto those incomes.
8  Corporate income tax receipts have been brisk so far this
year, and daily data for June indicate another double-digit increase in paymentsthis month.
Outlays, adjusted for payment timing shifts, rose 5-1/2 percent in April and May
relative to a year earlier.  Medicaid continued to post large year-over-yearincreases that reflect the temporary step-up in the federal matching rate enactedlast year to funnel more money to the states.  Payments should fall back in thethird quarter when the increase in the matching rate expires.  In contrast, year-over-year increases in defense spending slowed markedly.
The House passed the conference agreement of the Congressional Budget
Resolution, but Senate action on this year’s resolution appears unlikely. Appropriations committees in both houses are working with the conferenceagreement’s fiscal 2005 discretionary cap of $821 billion, which excludes anysupplemental funding for Iraq and is consistent with the President’s Februarybudget proposal.  In late May, the Administration requested $25 billion in newbudget authority for Iraq and stated that additional funds will be requested at alater date.

The Senate passed a corporate tax bill that, among its 273 provisions, repeals the
exclusion for extraterritorial income that was declared in violation of WorldTrade Organization rules.  It also temporarily lowers the taxes paid onrepatriated earnings and reduces the top effective tax rate to 32 percent onincome derived from domestic production activities.  It is roughly budgetneutral.  A similar bill passed by the House is not budget neutral, in large partbecause it also lowers corporate income taxes for nondomestic productionactivities (but not the top rate) and provides $10 billion to tobacco growers.  TheSenate leadership hopes to have a conference agreement before the Augustrecess, but the significant differences between the two bills may not be workedout by then.
State and Local Governments
Most information received from state and local governments in recent weekscontinues to point to strengthening in the sector after three years of malaise. Employment rose, on average, during April and May, although the increase wasbelow the gains recorded in the previous two quarters.  Construction advancedstrongly in March and April; outlays for highways, streets, and bridges wereespecially large.
With the fiscal year ending on June 30 in all but four states, most states have
passed fiscal 2005 budgets.  The number of states that have had to deal withbudget shortfalls this year is smaller than in recent years, as are the projectedgaps.  Much of the good fiscal news reflects stronger revenue collections thanoriginally forecast.  Enacted and proposed strategies to patch prospectiveshortfalls are similar to those of recent years and include spending cuts(Michigan), tax hikes (Virginia, Alabama), and borrowing from reserve funds(Iowa) and from the market (New York).
Prices and Labor Costs
Overall consumer price inflation has picked up this year, driven by a surge inenergy prices and a rebound from unusually small increases in prices elsewhere. In May, energy prices registered another large increase, but core price inflationmoderated.  The twelve-month change in the consumer price index was3.1 percent in May, 1 percentage point above the rate posted for the precedingtwelve-month period. 
After a pause in April, the CPI for energy rose 4.6 percent in May.  As has been
the case since the turn of the year, most of the surge in energy prices was drivenby a rise in crude oil costs.  But the markup of retail prices over crude costs alsoincreased because of strong demand that has kept inventories relatively low andbecause of the costs of adjusting to some states’ new requirements onreformulated gasoline.  More recently, the available survey data for June showdeclines in retail gasoline prices that are roughly in line with the recent drop-offin crude oil prices.

9. The final report on first-quarter GDP—to be issued after Greenbook publication—will
contain revisions to PCE prices.  A potentially important source of revision will be the BEA’s
incorporation of the source data for imputed banking services, a volatile component ofnonmarket PCE prices that can cause significant swings in core PCE prices.Consumer food prices jumped 0.9 percent in May, after having risen only
0.1 percent per month, on average, in the preceding four months.  Increaseswere widespread but were particularly marked for dairy products and meats. Over the twelve months ending in May, the CPI for food rose 4.1 percent, thelargest such increase since December 1996 and up considerably from the1.7 percent rise posted in the previous twelve-month period.  Aside from dairyproducts, where output has been constrained by herd reductions over the pastfew years, there have been no major disruptions in farm supplies.  Becauseexports of livestock and poultry have been held back by health concerns, thisprice surge likely reflects strong domestic consumer demand.  
Excluding food and energy, consumer prices increased 0.2 percentage point in
May, a smaller increase than in the preceding two months.  In particular, the rateof inflation for a wide range of  services slowed last month.  So far this year, thepace of core inflation has outstripped the rate in the second half of last year.  Inpart, this acceleration is due to the pass-through of higher energy and importcosts into core consumer prices, but it also likely reflects payback for unusuallymodest increases or outright price declines in several categories.  The twelve-month change in the core CPI was 1.7 percent, 0.1 percentage point above theyear-earlier increase.
The CPI data suggest that core PCE prices increased about 0.1 percent in May,
bringing the twelve-month inflation rate by that measure to 1.4 percent, also just0.1 percentage point above the rate observed a year earlier.
9  Excluding the
categories in which prices are not based on market transactions does not changethe picture:  Market-based core PCE inflation has risen roughly in line with theincrease in both core CPI and core PCE inflation over the past year.
Despite a slight decline in commodity prices in the past several weeks, led by
considerable drops in prices for steel scrap and plywood, most of the sharp run-up in commodities prices since 2002 remains in place.   Since the end of April,the Journal of Commerce industrial commodities price index, which includesenergy commodities, has fallen 5.3 percent, while the Commodities ResearchBureau index of spot industrial prices, which excludes energy prices, is down4.3 percent.  Nonetheless, these indexes are up 25.5 percent and 17.4 percent,respectively, over the past year. 
Core intermediate materials prices in the producer price index accelerated
substantially in 2002 and 2003 and have continued to ascend in recent months.

In May, core intermediate materials prices climbed 0.9 percent, marking the
fifth consecutive month of outsized increases. 
Short-run inflation expectations have edged higher in the past few months,
perhaps because of the pickup in actual inflation.  The median of year-ahead
inflation expectations from the Michigan survey was 3.4 percent in thepreliminary June release, up slightly from the figures reported in April and Mayand noticeably above the first-quarter average of 2.7 percent.  Median long-runinflation expectations moved up in the first half of June to 3.0 percent, but,assuming this increase is sustained for the full month of June, the second-quarter average would still remain within the range observed over the past fewyears. 
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of 4.6 percent last quarter, the same pace as in 2003. However, with moderate productivity increases in the past two quarters, unitlabor costs have turned up.  Although these data are fairly volatile and prone tolarge revisions, current data suggest that nonfarm business unit labor costs roseat an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the first quarter after having fallen 0.9 percentover the four quarters of 2003.  In April and May, increases in average hourlyearnings for production or nonsupervisory workers were a bit above the monthlygains posted in the first quarter and were well above the increase in the lastquarter of 2003.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Further signs of strengthening in economic activity, along with indications of apickup in inflation pressures, prompted a significant upward revision ininvestors’ expectations about the path of the federal funds rate.  Marketparticipants appear virtually certain of a quarter-point tightening at theupcoming meeting and anticipate roughly 200 basis points of cumulative policyfirming over the next year.  The upward revision to the anticipated path ofpolicy drove up the two-year Treasury yiel d about 1/2 percentage point and the
ten-year yield 20 basis points, producing a considerable flattening in the termstructure.  Readings based on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securitiessuggest that inflation compensation over the next five years moved upmoderately but remained relatively well anchored over intervals beyond thathorizon.  Broad stock prices edged higher as an improved earnings outlookapparently offset the effects of the rise in longer-term yields.  
Reflecting slowing mortgage refinanci ngs, household debt growth appears to
have moderated somewhat from the rapid first-quarter pace.  Borrowing bynonfinancial corporations has remained light as firms have continued to fundspending with strong profits and sizable holdings of cash.  
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields
The unexpectedly strong gains in nonfarm payrolls in April, reported a few daysafter the May FOMC meeting, caused investors to move forward the expecteddate of the onset of policy tightening to the June meeting, a view that wascemented by the subsequent employment release.  Investors also seemedespecially attuned to inflation data and to statements by Federal Reservepolicymakers for information on the pace and ultimate extent of tightening.  Onbalance, federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates moved up 25 to 45 basispoints over the intermeeting period.  Judging from options prices, investors see a25 basis point policy tightening as almost certain at the upcoming meeting.  Inrecent surveys, the preponderance of re spondents anticipate that the FOMC will
view risks to the outlook for both economic growth and inflation as balancedand that the FOMC will retain the “measured pace” language—or some variantthereof—in the announcement following the June meeting.  Futures quotesfurther out moved higher and suggest that market participants expect a series oftightenings that would put the federal funds rate at about 3 percent by the middleof next year, although the distribution of likely outcomes is fairly wide.  
Upward revisions to the expected policy path showed through to Treasury
yields.  On balance, yields on two- and ten-year nominal Treasury securitiesincreased about 45 and 20 basis points, respectively, over the intermeetingperiod.  Inflation compensation, as measured by the difference between nominalTreasury yields and their inflation-indexed counterparts, drifted higher in the
III-2
III-3
first half of the intermeeting period, partly in response to stronger-than-expected
incoming data and to record highs in oil prices.  Some of this rise was reversedwith the May CPI release and comments by FOMC members suggesting that theCommittee would tighten policy as required to contain inflation pressures.  Onnet, inflation compensation over the next five years rose about 15 basis pointsbut ticked up only a bit over the following five-year period. Stock Prices and Corporate Interest RatesBroad stock price indexes edged up, on net, over the intermeeting period, asgenerally favorable news about the economy was largely offset by the influenceof higher interest rates.  Stock prices dipped in early May in response to thejump in interest rates and to heightened inflation fears triggered by the Aprillabor market report and rising oil prices.  Later in the period, stock pricesreversed their earlier losses as oil prices receded and inflation fears easedsomewhat.
The spread of the forward earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 over a long-term
real Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity premium—was essentiallyunchanged over the intermeeting period.  Implied volatilities of theS&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 remained quite low.
Yields of investment- and speculative-grade bonds rose about 25 to 30 basis
points over the period and largely tracked the movements of comparable-maturity Treasuries.  On net, risk spreads on corporate bonds edged up just afew basis points.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality
Analysts’ earnings forecasts have been marked up on the heels of exceptionallystrong first-quarter earnings reports.  The revisions index for current andyear-ahead earnings for the month ending in mid-May, most of which occurredbefore the May FOMC meeting, jumped to its highest level in more than twodecades.  Revisions were also positive through mid-June, although they weremostly concentrated among petroleum firms.  Despite the positive revisions,analysts’ forecasts of second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms appearconservative and suggest that another spell of upward revisions is in the offing.
Corporate credit quality remains solid.  Nonfinancial corporations’ short-term
debt ratios remained low, and the ratio of interest-expense to cash flow droppedfurther in the first quarter.  Bond upgrades in the current quarter, measured asthe share of the par value of outstanding bonds, are on pace to exceed bonddowngrades for the first time since 1998.  C&I delinquency rates fell in the firstquarter, and the bond default rate remained near zero in April and May.
III-4
III-5
III-6
III-7
KMV’s expected year-ahead default rate has hovered at about its four-year low
in recent months, indicating that market-based measures of risk do not portend adecline in credit quality from the anticipated tightening of monetary policy. This outlook is consistent with the experience in the 1994 tightening episode,when the combination of higher interest rates and robust earnings had little neteffect on credit performance.  Indeed, bond rating changes and interest coverageratios continued to improve following the rise in rates in 1994.  More recently,firms that rely on floating rate debt, and thus are more vulnerable to rising rates,have tended to use derivatives to hedge their interest rate exposure. 
Business Finance
Investment- and speculative-grade bond issuance was sluggish in May and hasremained so in June, as higher interest rates have choked off the alreadydwindling flow of opportunistic issuance. With proceeds still being used torepay higher-rate debt, net bond issuance was negative in May and June. Short-term credit has continued the slow turnaround that began in the firstquarter, with outstanding commercial paper and C&I loans combined increasingin May.  Overall, nonfinancial corporate debt appears to have grown at a verysubdued pace in recent weeks, as earnings have continued to outpace spending,and many firms remain flush with cash. Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained muted in May and June. IPOs have continued to trickle out, but many have been priced under the initialfiling range, reflecting weak demand.  At the same time, share repurchases werelikely bolstered again by strong profits, and announcements of leveragedbuyouts and other cash-financed M&A deals have picked up.  As a result, netequity issuance will likely remain substantially negative in the second quarter.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial mortgage debt continued to expand at a rapid clip in the firstquarter, and debt growth is estimated to have remained brisk in the currentquarter.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by banks andinsurance companies are low and have been declining of late; CMBSdelinquency rates through May have also edged down.  CMBS spreads remainlow.  REIT equity prices moved up over the intermeeting period, reversingabout half of the sharp decline registered in the previous intermeeting period. The ratio of net operating income to price—often called the "cap rate”—oncommercial properties declined further in the first quarter to stand at a level lastseen in the early 1990s.  The spread of this ratio to the real perpetuity Treasuryyield—an indicator of the risk premium on commercial real estate assets—hasnarrowed considerably recently but remains well above that seen in the late1980s.
III-8
III-9
Household Finance
Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen about 85 basispoints from the lows reached in the first quarter and have dampened refinancingactivity.  The further drop in refinancing applications this month indicates thatrefinancings will continue to moderate.  At the same time, purchase originationshave only edged off, suggesting that mortgage debt growth in the second quarterwill not be far below the rapid 12-1/2 percent pace in the first quarter. Consumer credit expanded at a 6 percent rate in the first quarter and is expectedto remain fairly brisk. 
On balance, recent indicators suggest some improvement in household credit
quality.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans at commercial banks declined inthe first quarter and those on securitized credit card pools fell again in April. Delinquencies on auto loans at captive finance companies ticked up in April butremain low by historical standards.  In addition, estimated bankruptcy filingswere lower in the second quarter from the same period last year.  
The combination of flat stock prices and strong income growth in the current
quarter suggests a slight decline in the ratio of net household worth todisposable income.  Bond mutual funds registered outflows in May, and flowsinto equity mutual funds were slightly negative as well, as householdsapparently shifted funds into other savings instruments such as money marketmutual funds.  Data for the first half of June indicate that households moved outof money market mutual funds as inflows to equity funds were renewed andoutflows from bond funds moderated.       
State and Local Government Finance
Gross municipal bond issuance remained rapid in May and in June to date, asstates and municipalities continued to raise substantial amounts of funds for newcapital projects.  Although advance refundings were fairly strong in April andMay, they remained well below the level in March, when interest rates werelower.  Short-term issuance in recent months has been very light, consistent withreports of improved fiscal positions of states and municipalities.
Yield ratios on longer-term general obligations were unchanged over the
intermeeting period and remain somewhat elevated.  Revenue bond spreadsticked down, and municipal bond upgrades have continued to outpacedowngrades since early February.
Treasury and Agency Finance
The Treasury borrowed less in the first quarter than it had projected earlier, andit revised down its estimated borrowing needs for the second quarter in responseto higher-than-expected tax receipts.  Treasury auctions over the intermeeting
III-10
III-11
III-12
III-13
period were generally well received.  Strong indirect bidding suggests that
foreign official institutions continued to purchase large amounts of the issues,even though reported intervention in the foreign exchange market has ground toa halt.  
In its May quarterly refunding statement, the Treasury announced that it would
issue TIPS at two new maturity points—five and twenty years.  These securitieswill be auctioned semiannually, with the first auction of the twenty-year securityscheduled for July and that of the five-year security for October.  The Treasuryalso noted that it is considering eliminating the reopenings of the nominal ten-year note in light of the new TIPS issuance and smaller-than-anticipatedborrowing needs.
Net borrowing by the housing GSEs continued to be quite light.   Agency
spreads widened early in the intermeeting period, concurrent with a widening ofswap spreads; nonetheless, these spreads remained well within their historicalrange.  In regulatory developments, Fannie Mae reached an agreement with theSEC regarding its accounting for manufactured housing loans and aircraft leasesthat allowed the company to avoid any restatement of past earnings asdemanded by OFHEO.  Fannie agreed to adopt stricter accounting rules forfuture statements.  To account for losses associated with this change, FannieMae will take a charge of up to $260 million in the second quarter.
Money and Bank Credit
The growth of M2 stepped up to an annual rate of 13 percent in May followingstrong gains in March and April.  Last month’s acceleration was driven largelyby a surge in retail money market funds, which rose at a 12-1/2 percent rate aftera year and a half of consecutive declines.  The rise likely reflects a combinationof large deposits of income tax refunds  and a reallocation of funds away from
the equity market.  Currency growth picked up to a 5-1/2 percent rate, wellabove the pace earlier in the year and apparently supported by increaseddomestic demand.  Preliminary data for the first half of June show a sharpslowing in M2 growth to around an estimated 3 percent annual rate. 
The growth of bank credit fell in May to an annual rate of 4 percent as bank’s
holdings of securities contracted and loan growth slowed.  The deceleration inloans was concentrated mainly in real estate credits and partly reflected heavysecuritizations.  Consumer loans on banks’ books expanded at just under a4 percent pace, but originations fell for the second consecutive month, reflectingweakness in credit card lending.  C&I loans fell again in May, albeit at a slowerpace than earlier in the year.
III-14
III-15
Asset quality at domestic commercial banks improved in the first quarter of
2004 as delinquency rates continued to trend lower across all major loancategories.  Data from the Federal Reserve’s May Survey of Terms of BusinessLending indicate that the spread over estimated funding costs for all C&I loansticked down in the second quarter.  Adjusted for the effects of changes in loancomposition, this spread was about unchanged at a fairly low level.

U.S. International Transactions
Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. international trade deficit in April jumped to $48.3 billion, a new
record high. 
The value of exported goods and services decreased 1.5 percent in April,
reflecting a 2.2 percent drop in the exports of goods.  The fall in exported goodswas widespread, with notable decreases in capital goods (particularly aircraft),industrial supplies, and agricultural products.  Exports of consumer goods andautomotive products also edged down.  Exports of services, in contrast,increased in April.
The value of imported goods and services ticked up 0.2 percent in April from
March’s strong level, as a large decline in the value of imported petroleum wasoffset by a rise in imports of non-oil goods.  The fall in the value of importedpetroleum resulted from a decline in volume.  Within imports of non-oil goods,notable increases were registered in capital goods, consumer goods, andindustrial supplies.  Imports of services edged up in April. 
The April trade release also included revisions to historical data back to 1992. 
The trade deficit in goods and services in 2004:Q1 is now $548 billion at anannual rate, $22 billion larger than published previously.  The larger deficit inthe first quarter reflects upward revisions to imports caused by a differenttreatment of insurance services and a new seasonal adjustment procedure forpetroleum.  For 2003, the trade deficit now stands at $497 billion, about $6billion larger than previously published.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Non-oil imports.   In May, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of
core goods rose 0.4 percent.  As in previous months, the price increases wereconcentrated in the commodity-intensive categories, particularly non-oilindustrial supplies.  The price index for industrial supplies rose 2.1 percent inboth April and May, largely reflecting higher prices for imported unfinishedmetals.  Prices for foods, feeds and beverages edged down 0.3 percent in May,the first decrease in eight months.  Prices of capital goods (excluding computersand semiconductors) edged up 0.1 percent.  In contrast, prices for automotiveproducts were unchanged, and prices of consumer goods fell 0.1 percent. Whereas import prices for computers ticked down 0.1 percent, import prices forsemiconductors rose 0.8 percent.
The average level of imported core goods prices in April and May was 
4.3 percent at an annual rate above the first-quarter level.  The rise wasconcentrated in non-oil industrial supplies and, to a lesser extent, foods, feedsand beverages.
Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 10.3 percent in May, and the spot price
of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil also rose about 10 percent,averaging $40.29 per barrel.  The spot price has edged down in June in responseto rising oil inventories and reports of increased production from OPEC,particularly from Saudi Arabia.  However, strong world oil demand driven byincreased economic activity, geopolitical events in the Middle East, andconcerns about the reliability of oil supplies from Venezuela and Nigeriacontinue to keep upward pressure on oil prices.
Exports.  In May, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods
increased 0.3 percent.  Rising 0.9 percent in May, prices for nonagriculturalindustrial supplies (particularly petroleum products, but also iron and chemicals)contributed most of the increase.  After increasing 2.7 percent in April, the priceindex for agricultural products rose only 0.5 percent in May, reflecting moremoderate increases in prices for soybeans and corn.  Prices for all other majorcategories of exports were unchanged. 
The average level of exported core goods prices in April and May was
6.9 percent at an annual rate above the first-quarter level.  Agricultural productsand industrial supplies were the main contributors to this quarterly increase.
Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $580 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of
2004, up from $508 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003 (revised).  Much of thechange was driven by a widening of the trade deficit on goods and services.

also contributed to the widening of the deficit.
The deficit on goods and services widened $46 billion in the first quarter as a
$74 billion increase in imported goods was only partially offset by a $28 billionincrease in exported goods.  The increase in the value of imported goods largelyreflected strong increases in petroleum, industrial supplies, capital goods, andconsumer goods.  The increase in the value of exported goods was concentratedin industrial supplies and capital goods.  Growth in imports and exports ofservices offset each other, with each increasing about $6 billion.  
The surplus on net investment income fell $14 billion in the first quarter, as a $2
billion rise in receipts was swamped by a $16 billion rise in payments.  Thesizable increase in payments was driven by an $11 billion increase in directinvestment payments.  The modest rise in receipts was a result of a $6 billionincrease in portfolio income, which was partially offset by declines ingovernment and direct investment receipts. 
Net unilateral transfers to foreigners rose $12.1 billion, as a result of an increase
in U.S. government grants. 
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) remained very strong in April at $43 billion,led by unusually high net purchases of agency securities (line 4b).  Demand forTreasuries (line 4a) and corporate debt securities (line 4c) were below their
IV-7
recent elevated norms, while acquisitions of equities (line 4d), which included a
merger-related stock swap, rebounded from net sales in March.  For the firstfour months of the year, private foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities are on apace well above that of the previous two years.  
Net foreign official inflows (line 1) were extremely large in the first quarter,
primarily because of Japanese intervention activity.  These inflows abatedsignificantly in April as Japanese intervention activity apparently ended.  Partialdata from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) show additionalinflows of $25 billion in May and a further $2 billion inflow through June 22.   
         .
The data presented above were affected by revisions included in BEA's June 18
balance of payments release.  These revisions had the effect of decreasingrecorded net private inflows into U.S. debt securities while increasing recordedofficial inflows.  For the first four months of the year, private inflows werereduced by $36 billion (agencies by $21 billion), while official inflows wereincreased by $8 billion.  These changes were made based on portfolio surveyresults and to account for official flows that are mistakenly recorded as privateflows.
At $17 billion, U.S. investors acquired foreign securities (line 5) at an unusually
brisk pace in April, led by net purchases of foreign equities (line 5b) andmerger-related stock swap activity (line 5c).  April also saw U.S. investorscontinue their well-established trend of modest net sales of foreign debtsecurities (line 5a).  Activity during the first quarter was similar to that seen inApril but at a more subdued pace, with net acquisitions of foreign equitiesexceeding net sales of foreign debt securities.  Although U.S. investors havebeen consistently reducing their holdings of foreign debt securities, through thefirst four months of the year U.S. investors have been net purchasers ofEuropean debt securities ($12 billion) while selling primarily Asian debtsecurities ($15 billion). 
The banking sector (line 3) recorded essentially offsetting flows in April
following moderate net outflows in the first quarter.
The recently released balance of payments data for the first quarter show that
U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) remained relatively steady at $57 billionwhile foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7) increased modestlyto $18 billion.  The direct investment data have been revised such that for 2003estimated U.S. direct investment abroad was increased by almost $20 billionwhile estimated foreign direct investment in the United Stated was reduced by
IV-8
over $40 billion.  The disparity between these direct investment flows is mainly
attributable to differing levels of reinvested earnings in the U.S. and abroadrather than to differences in new cross-border acquisitions.  
The statistical discrepancy was negative for the second consecutive quarter,
indicating some combination of underreporting of the current account deficit oroverreporting of net capital inflows.
IV-9
IV-10
Foreign Exchange Markets
The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index,
declined 1½ percent, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  At the beginningof the period, the dollar rallied following the release of the robust April U.S.employment report, which led market participants to move up their projectedpath of FOMC tightening.  The dollar did not sustain these gains, however, asthe U.S. trade deficit reached a record monthly high in April and the difficultiesin Iraq eroded some of the positive sentiment towards the dollar.  On a bilateralbasis, the dollar depreciated 1½ percent, on balance, against the euro, yen, andCanadian dollar.  The U.S. dollar fell by a larger amount against the currenciesof two countries that tightened monetary policy over the period – Switzerlandand the United Kingdom – depreciating 3¾ percent against the franc and2½ percent vis-à-vis sterling. 
Short-term interest rates rose 40 basis points in the United Kingdom, as the
Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee raised its policy rate 25 basispoints on May 6 and again on June 10, lifting the rate to 4.5 percent.  U.K.economic data were quite strong, with retail sales growing robustly and theunemployment rate falling to 2.8 percent, its lowest level since 1975.  Inexplaining its policy actions, the Bank of England also expressed concern overthe boom in housing prices.  Swiss short-term rates, which have risen 20 basispoints on net since the last FOMC meeting, began increasing in early June aheadof the Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy meeting on June 17.  At that
IV-11
meeting the SNB tightened monetary policy, raising the top of its target range
for three-month Swiss franc Libor by 25 ba sis points, to 1 percent, and stated
that it would now aim to keep the rate close to the center of its 0 to 1 percenttarget range.
Amid further signs that the global economic expansion will be sustained,
long-term interest rates rose about 20 basis points in Europe and almost 40 basispoints in Japan and Canada over the intermeeting period.  Japan reportedeconomic growth of 5.6 percent in the first quarter, above market expectations. Sanguine data on Japanese manufacturing activity, labor market, and corporateprofits led the Bank of Japan to upgrade its assessment of the economic outlookin its latest monthly report.  Market participants noted that the BOJ removed theword “gradual” from its description of the recovery.  Canadian economic datawere also strong, as the April and May labor market reports showedmuch-larger-than-expected gains in employment and the unemployment ratedeclined from 7.5 percent to 7.2 percent.  Headline inflation in Canada was alsoabove market expectations.
Major equity indexes were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period,
IV-12
as higher interest rates and concerns over the run-up in oil prices offset
expectations of robust economic growth.  Fluctuations over the period weregenerally subdued in the major stock markets, with the exception of Japan,where share prices fell sharply in early May following statements by Chineseauthorities that they would take action to slow their economy.  However,Japanese share prices subsequently recovered most of that decline.     Higher oil prices and rising global interest rates also weighed on equity prices inthe emerging markets.  Asian share prices had their sharpest one-day declinesince September 2001 on May 10 in reaction to the spike in global interest ratesafter the release of the U.S. employment report for April.  The prospect oftighter monetary policy in China damped sentiment, most notably in Indonesiaand Korea, where stock market indexes fell 11 and 15 percent, respectively onnet.  Amid the decline in share prices, the Indonesian rupiah depreciated 8percent relative to the dollar, leading the Indonesian central bank to intervene tostem the currency’s decline.
In Latin America, the Brazilian real depreciated 5½ percent against the dollar
over the period, despite a report showing that the Brazilian economy grew at a6.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter.  Market participants again pointed tooil prices and global interest rates, as well as some political difficulties for theLula administration, to explain the weakness of the currency.  Share prices inArgentina fell 11 percent over the period as several leading firms reportedlower-than-expected first-quarter earnings.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Growth in the major foreign industrial economies was solid in the first quarter. 
Japanese output rose 6.1 percent, led by a large increase in personalconsumption.  Indicators for the second quarter continue to be strong.  RealGDP in the United Kingdom expanded 2.5 percent in the first quarter, boostedby strong increases in consumption, government expenditure, and investment. The euro area posted a 2.3 percent rise in GDP in the first quarter.  Domesticdemand was led by strong household consumption expenditure, althoughindicators for the second quarter are somewhat mixed.  Canadian real GDP grew2.4 percent, as robust final domestic demand offset  a dramatic slowdown in therate of inventory accumulation.  Indicators of growth in the second quarter havebeen favorable.
Consumer price inflation has moved up a bit in the second quarter mainly as a
result of higher energy prices.  Twelve-month headline inflation in Canadaincreased to 2.5 percent.  Inflation in the euro area also rose to 2.5 percent inMay, well above the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling.  In the United Kingdom inflationrose somewhat, but remained below the Bank of England’s 2 percent inflationtarget.  Slight CPI deflation persisted in Japan. 
In the United Kingdom, the Monetary Policy Committee increased its policy
rate 25 basis points in June, the fourth such hike since last November.  Monetarypolicy in the euro area, Japan, and Canada remained on hold. 
In Japan , real GDP continued its recent strong growth, rising 6.1 percent in the
first quarter, led by personal consumption, which rose 4 percent. Business fixedinvestment advanced 7 percent, while government investment continued tocontract sharply.  A large increase in i nventories contributed 2 percentage points
to growth.  Exports soared 17 percent, boosted by buoyant growth in emergingAsia (especially China).  The gain in exports outpaced a 12 percent increase inimports, and net exports added 1 percentage point to growth.  Nominal GDProse 4.2 percent, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of increase.  The GDPdeflator fell 2.5 percent below its year-ago level. 
Indicators suggest that activity continued to expand strongly in the second
quarter.  Real exports increased a further 2.7 percent in May on a monthly basisfollowing a strong increase in April.  Real imports fell in May after rising theprevious two months, but were up 5.6 percent from May 2003, reflecting soliddomestic demand.  Household expenditures surged 5.8 percent in April from theprevious month, registering the largest monthly gain on record, and measures ofconsumer confidence continued to rise.  New car registrations moved down inApril and May following a jump in the first quarter, but remained at relatively

Japanese banks continued to make progress in reducing bad-debt levels.  As of
March 2004, Japan’s four “mega” banks classified 5 percent of total outstandingloans as “non-performing”, down from 7 percent in the previous year.  Mostlarge Japanese banks also reported substantial net profits and improvedregulatory capital ratios for the fiscal year that ended in March.  However, theincrease in reported profits largely reflected realized gains on equity portfolioholdings, a one-time tax rebate from the Tokyo metropolitan government, andreduced credit costs.  Core operating earnings remained flat, suggesting thatJapanese banks have not yet begun to improve operating performance.

Indicators of economic activity for the second quarter are somewhat mixed. 
Euro-area industrial production rose modestly in April.  Retail sales reboundedin April, increasing 1.3 percent after falling in both February and March. Survey measures for May indicate a slightly less rosy picture.  The German IFObusiness climate index fell in May, leaving its level well below the first quarteraverage.  The European Commission’s confidence survey also showed declinesin both consumer and industrial confidence.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation jumped to 2.5 percent in May, moving
well above the ECB’s 2 percent target ceiling.  Core inflation, excluding energy,food, alcohol, and tobacco remained at 1.9 percent in May.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  expanded 2.5 percent in the first quarter,
marked by strong increases in consumption, government expenditure, andinvestment.  These increases were partly offset by a 1.7 percentage pointnegative arithmetic contribution from net exports, as exports contracted sharply.

production and manufacturing output expanded in April, and Maymanufacturing PMI ticked up further.  Business confidence rose appreciably inMay.  Retail sales grew at a brisk pace in May. 
According to the two leading private surveys, housing price inflation has picked
up in recent months, with the average twelve-month rise at around 20 percent inMay.  Household net mortgage and consumer borrowing remained elevated inApril.

The labor market continued to be tight, as both the official-claims-based and the
labor-force-survey measures of the unemployment rate remained near theirlowest points since 1975.  The twelve-month CPI inflation rate rose to 1.5percent in May, still well below the Bank of England’s 2 percent target.
On June 10, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised the official repo rate
another 25 basis points to 4.5 percent.  This tightening is the fourth 25-basis-point increase since November.  The MPC’s statement noted that strongconsumption, investment, and a buoyant housing market have all supportedgrowth at, or above, trend.  The statement cited a “small and diminishing marginof spare capacity” and the continued build-up of inflationary pressures asmotivation for the hike.

In Canada , real GDP grew 2.4 percent in first quarter, as robust domestic
demand offset the effects of a dramatic slowdown in the rate of inventoryaccumulation.  Investment was supported by the continued strength ofresidential construction, while consumption surged.  A sharp increase inmachinery and equipment shipments pushed up export growth, whereas a largedecrease in automotive imports restrained overall import growth.
Indicators for the second quarter have been favorable.  Employment increased
rapidly in both April and May, with hours worked increasing at a near recordrate in May.  Average housing starts in April and May were 6.5 percent abovethe first-quarter average.  Exports shot 8 percent above their first-quarteraverage in April, while imports increased 3 percent.  Manufacturing shipmentsrose for the fifth consecutive month in April, while new orders jumped 2.4percent.  In May, a composite index of leading indicators recorded its strongestincrease in two years.

In May, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation increased to 2.5 percent
from 1.6 percent in April.  The increase was largely due to a 30 percent year-over-year increase in the price of gasoline.  Twelve-month core inflation,excluding food, energy, and indirect taxes, edged up only slightly to 1.3 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
Economic growth in the developing economies generally has remained robust,
supported by strong demand from the United States and a buoyant high-techsector.  There have been recent indications, however, that policy tightening maybe slowing the expansion of the Chinese economy, which itself has been asignificant source of demand for the other Asian economies.  In Latin America,the Mexican economy appears to be firing on all cylinders, while growth inBrazil has occurred despite weak domestic demand.  Across the developingeconomies, inflation has remained moderate despite increases in energy prices. 
There are clear signs that the Chinese economy is slowing from the blistering
pace it has maintained since the end of the SARS epidemic last year. Twelve-month growth in investment, industrial production, the money supply(M2), lending, and imports all decelerated in May, indicating that theadministrative and quantitative measures taken by the government are havingthe desired effect.  Because the deceleration in activity has not been too sharpand because retail sales and exports have continued to post very strong gains,most analysts think that the Chinese economy is on course for a soft landing.
Price data provide additional evidence that the Chinese economy is cooling. 
One measure of producer prices fell in May, the first month-to-month decline inalmost a year.  Overall consumer prices were up 4.4 percent over the sameperiod, but the lion’s share of that increase came from food prices, which rosealmost 12 percent due to supply shocks; non-food consumer prices were up lessthan ½ percent in May from a year ago.

The Hong Kong economy grew a bit more than 4 percent in the first quarter. 
Booming tourism from China boosted retail sales and consumer confidence inrecent months, and trade volumes (an important indicator for the entrepôteconomy) remain near record highs.  The unemployment rate has fallen morethan 1½ percentage points below its peak last year during the SARS epidemic. Economic growth has put upward pressure on consumer prices, which have beenrising on a monthly basis for several quarters now, although they are still downfrom a year ago.

Incoming data for Korea  point to moderation in economic activity.  GDP rose
3.2 percent in the first quarter, following a torrid 11.3 percent pace in the fourthquarter.  Growth was entirely concentrated in the trade and government sectors;private consumption and investment declined.  Indicators for the second quartershow a similar pattern.  Retail sales for April and business and consumerconfidence for April and May remained low.  Industrial production rose1.1 percent in April, supported by growth in the export-related industries. Exports and imports continued to be strong and the trade balance remained highat an annual rate of $39 billion in April.  Inflation in April and May held nearthe first-quarter average of 3.3 percent.  The Korean stock market index hasdeclined markedly recently, in part reflecting concerns about weak domesticdemand and fears of a hard landing in China.  Markets reacted little to thereinstatement of President Roh on May 14 immediately following the KoreanSupreme Court's ruling overturning his impeachment.

In the ASEAN  economies, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia recorded
very strong growth in the first quarter, supported by both external demand anddomestic consumption.  Activity in Malaysia and Thailand also continued togrow, but at rates that disappointed expectations.  In the case of Malaysia, thispartly reflected a change in the quarterly pattern, with fourth-quarter growthbeing revised substantially upwards.  For Thailand, the slowing of growthreflects the adverse effect of higher oil prices, weakness in the agriculturesector, and political unrest in the southern states.  Recent data on industrialproduction are generally encouraging, with the exception of the Philippines. Spurred by demand for electronics and high-tech products, exports haveremained buoyant through much of the region.  There is some evidence ofincreased inflation pressures in the region.
In political developments, President Arroyo was officially declared the winner
of the Philippine elections held in mid-May, although the margin of victory wasslim.  The Indonesian parliamentary elections resulted in a defeat for PresidentMegawati’s party.  This leaves the field wide open for the presidential electionsto be held on July 5, which is a source of considerable uncertainty that isweighing on financial markets.  Indonesia’s central bank took measures in earlyJune to drain excess liquidity, including an increase in reserve requirements, inan attempt to stem the slide of the Indonesian rupiah.

In Mexico, GDP growth continued at a robust pace of more than 5 percent in the
first quarter, and recent indicators suggest that growth remained strong in thecurrent quarter.  Industrial production rose 1.3 percent in April and exportspicked up sharply, as the manufacturing sector continued to be buoyed bydemand from the United States.  Construction activity strengthened in April aswell, consistent with a pickup in investment spending.  Labor market conditionshave begun to improve–the rise in maquiladora employment that began last fallhas accelerated, and the national unemployment rate edged down inApril–contributing to a considerable increase in retail sales in the first quarter.
The Bank of Mexico has left its monetary stance unchanged since tightening
policy on April 27, but short-term market interest rates have moved upsomewhat.  Mexican twelve-month consumer price inflation edged up to4.3 percent in May, and inflation expectations and one-year wage settlementsremain just above 4 percent, the upper end of the 2 to 4 percent band for theBank of Mexico’s inflation target.  High oil prices boosted the Mexican publicsector fiscal surplus to a record high during the first four months of this year,and the government has increased transfers to the states for infrastructurespending, implying greater fiscal stimulus even as the government deficitremains on target.

In Brazil , real GDP grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter after rising a revised
5.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  The first-quarter increase largely reflected arise in net exports, while growth in domestic demand was weak.  Industrialproduction declined 1.4 percent in the first quarter, on average, but rose sharplyin March and edged up further in April.  Other indicators, such as capital goodsproduction, also point to expansion in industrial activity in April.  Althoughurban unemployment has remained high, employment growth has been solid,particularly in the agricultural sector.  Twelve-month headline inflationcontinued to fall, but monthly inflation picked up in May and is widely expectedto rise further in June and July as a result of mid-June hikes in fuel prices.
Declines in Brazilian asset prices, including the depreciation of the real, since
early April prompted the central bank to leave its policy rate unchanged at16 percent at its June 15-16 meeting.  The policy rate was cut from 26½ percentto 16½ percent over the second half of 2003, but concerns about inflation haveprompted the central bank to slow the pace of interest rate declines.  Surveymeasures of average twelve-month ahead expected inflation have moved upfrom 5½ percent in early May to over 6 percent in mid-June.  The Braziliangovernment has not auctioned any fixed-rate domestic debt since late April and

has resorted to its usual practice of shortening the maturity structure of the
domestic debt in times of financial stress.

The Argentine  economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter.  However, recent
data suggest that the ongoing economic recovery could be adversely affected bythe country’s energy problems.  Industrial production fell 4 percent in April,following a sharp increase in the first quarter that was apparently the result offirms’ anticipation of energy price increases and potential energy shortagesduring the winter months of the southern hemisphere.  Capacity pressures in theenergy sector are a result of limited investment over the past few years becauseof utility price controls and general economic disruption.  Argentina has so farresponded to the energy crisis by importing electricity from Brazil, natural gasfrom Bolivia, and fuel oil from Venezuela; by cutting natural gas exports toChile; and by taxing exports of hydrocarbon products to finance the creation of astate-run energy company.  Despite this, Argentina has continued to run sizabletrade surpluses, and twelve-month consumer price inflation remained low inApril, at just over 4 percent.
Although Argentina has met all quantitative targets agreed with the IMF with
comfortable margins, it has lagged behind in other areas, such as reform of thefederal-provincial fiscal structure, ba nk compensation, and debt restructuring. 
In early June, the Argentine government unveiled a new debt restructuring planthat is somewhat more favorable to creditors than the original proposal last year.

The most significant concession by the Argentine government is the offer to
recognize most, if not all, of the roughly $20 billion in past-due interest that hasaccrued since the December 2001 default.  The new offer would result in anet-present-value reduction of the defaulted debt of about 75 percent.  Theoriginal proposal implied a reduction of about 90 percent in net present valueterms.  The offer would also include “growth coupons” on the new bonds, whichwould result in higher interest payments if GDP growth were to exceed certainthresholds.

In Venezuela , despite political uncertainties, activity this year has expanded,
fueled by expansionary fiscal policies.  It was announced that President HugoChavez will face a recall referendum on August 15, ending months of disputesover whether the opposition had collected enough valid signatures to force thereferendum.  There are strong concerns that Chavez will manage to delay thereferendum, which by law must be held before August 19 or it will be too closeto the 2006 end of Chavez’s term.  In addition, opinion polls do not give clearsignals on whether there is sufficient popular support for a regime change.  Pooreconomic performance under Chavez led to a failed coup attempt in 2002 and todebilitating national strikes later that year; activity has not fully recovered sincethen.  Oil production is still believed to be about 15 percent below pre-strikelevels.
