1. According to our contact at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the agency does not
have an explanation for the decline in average w eekly hours last month.  In particular, the BLS
could not find evidence that hours were depressed by former President Reagan’s funeral, which
took place during the survey reference week.Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
Although economic activity in the late spring appears to have been weaker than
we had expected as of the last Greenbook, the few indications available for thesecond half are consistent with a resumption of stronger activity.  Initial claimsfor unemployment insurance have remained in a range consistent withsubstantial gains in jobs, sales of autos and light trucks rebounded in July, homesales and permits have remained robust, and orders and shipments of nondefensecapital goods rose smartly in June.  Meanwhile, core consumer price inflationhas moderated substantially in recent months, although higher energy pricescontinue to boost inflation.
Labor Market Developments
Employment gains slowed substantially in June following large increases in the
March-May period.  The stepdown in private nonfarm payroll gains waswidespread, and most major industries posted increases less than half the size ofthose in the preceding three months.  In addition, the average workweek ofproduction or nonsupervisory workers dipped 0.2 hour in June, to 33.6 hours,pushing aggregate hours down 0.6 percent.
1  Even so, for the second quarter as a
whole, aggregate hours rose at an annual rate of 2.0 percent, as the averagemonthly increase in employment was nearly 230,000.
According to the household survey, the labor market situation was little changed
in June.  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.6 percent, about the samelevel it has held since the start of the year.  The labor force participation rateticked up 0.1 percentage point, to 66.0 percent, with rates for all age groupsexcept teenagers showing small increases.  The employment-population ratio,which reflects changes in both the unemployment rate and the labor forceparticipation rate, edged up, although it remained within the low range seensince early last year.
Other indicators point to a more positive tone in the labor market.  Since the 
June reference week, the four-week moving average of initial claims forunemployment insurance has fluctuated in a range just below 350,000, a paceconsistent with solid employment gains.  The number of job losers unemployedless than five weeks as a percent of household employment, another measurethat serves as a proxy for layoffs, edged down in June.  And layoffannouncements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., declinedin both June and July. The four-week moving average of insured unemploymentis down a bit from its level during the June survey week.

2.   These figures represent our best estimate of the productivity data to be reported in the
BLS Productivity and Cost release on August 10.  At that time the BLS will release revisedproductivity estimates for 2001:Q1 through 2004:Q1 that reflect both the annual revisions to theNIPA (see the appendix) and changes to its method for calculating some of the components ofhours.  Because of the change in methodology, the hours data will be revised back to 1947, butthe effects of these revisions on both the level a nd the rate of growth of productivity are expected
to be small. Labor Output per Hour

Small-business hiring plans edged up in June and stand at a level well above last
year’s trough, according to the July report from the National Federation ofIndependent Businesses.  In addition, according to both the Conference Boardand Michigan surveys, consumers in July continued by a wide margin to expectthe labor market to improve over coming months.
Using the incoming NIPA data, we now estimate that productivity in the
nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the firstquarter and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters ending inthe second quarter of 2004, productivity rose an estimated 4.5 percent, about thesame as in the previous four quarters.
2  Looking back further, the revised
productivity data now show a slightly more muted dip in productivity in 2001,followed by a slightly weaker recovery in 2002, but the level of output per hourat the end of last year was nearly unchanged from the previous estimate.

Industrial Production
Production fell 0.3 percent in June after having risen rapidly in April and May. 
The recent dip in industrial activity does not appear to have extended beyondJune; indeed, the available near-term indicators point to an increase inproduction in July.  Motor vehicle assemblies are on track to increase from theslow pace in June, and the decline in output among other industries for whichwe have weekly production data is mostly attributable to unseasonably coolweather in July that reduced electricity generation.  Elsewhere, manufacturingorders appear to be well maintained and are consistent with solid near-termincreases in production.  The available new orders diffusion indexes from theInstitute for Supply Management (ISM) and the various regional surveys allmoved up in July, and although the staff's series on real adjusted durable goodsorders has dropped back in recent months, it remains at a high level.
In June, the output of utilities and motor vehicles and parts posted significant
declines, which together reduced the change in total IP about 0.4 percentagepoint.  The output at utilities dropped as temperatures returned to more-normallevels after an unseasonably warm May.  Motor vehicle and parts productionslipped about 2-1/2 percent for a second month in June as automakers scaledback assemblies in response to an elevated level of truck inventories.
Elsewhere in the industrial sector, manufacturing production excluding motor
vehicles and parts, which makes up three-fourths of total IP, edged up0.1 percent in June after having risen by about 0.7 percent per month since thebeginning of the year.  For the second quarter as a whole, this component of IProse at an annual rate of nearly 9 percent, the largest gain in seven years.
Production of high-technology goods continued to advance at a solid clip in the
second quarter.  The gains were concentrated in the output of computers andsemiconductors and related equipment, which increased between 35 percent and40 percent (annual rate); utilization rates in these two industries now standaround 20 percentage points above the lows reached in the last business-cycledownturn.  In contrast, utilization rates for manufacturers of communicationsequipment, who eked out only a small increase in production last quarter,remain stubbornly low.
Looking ahead, unit shipments of personal computers edged down during the
second quarter, but research analysts at Gartner are projecting a stronger-than-normal back-to-school season in the third quarter and a sizable pickup in thepace of replacements of aging PCs.  The midpoint of Intel’s third-quarterrevenue guidance is consistent with another solid increase in worldwideshipments of microprocessor units (MPUs), the high-value semiconductor chipsused in personal computers and servers.  But that increase in MPU shipmentsmay not translate into markedly higher production in the near term because

3. Intel attributes the recent increases in inventories to unexpectedly high productivity of
newly installed chip fabrication equipment, inte ntional inventory building in anticipation of a
greater-than-usual back-to-school increase in computer sales this year, and weaker-than-
anticipated second-quarter demand.
4. Because the MPUs that Intel has slated for production one year from now (about the lead
time needed for new semiconductor manufacturing equipment) are physically larger than thecurrently produced chips (because of the inclusion of multiple processors on a single chip), Intel
must significantly retool a number of fabrication facilities.
5. A recent conversation with representativ es from the Institute for Supply Management
(ISM) confirmed our explanation for the widely  reported increase in the gap between the ISM
and FRB measures of capacity utilization in Apr il.  Specifically, the significant increase in the
ISM utilization rate apparently reflected a subs tantial share of respondents taking the sharply
lower level of post-recession employment into account when assessing their operating rates. Incontrast, the FRB measure, which abstracts from labor and considers only the plants and
equipment in place and ready to operate, rose by a smaller amount.Intel’s inventories of MPUs have risen significantly during the past three
quarters.3 
For the semiconductor industry more broadly, the contributions of MPUs to the
change in overall semiconductor production have been noticeably less than inthe late 1990s, while contributions of non-MPU chips, particularly those used inconsumer electronics, such as cell phones, have accounted for a greater share ofproduction gains.  Moreover, high utilization rates among chip manufacturersand expectations of future capacity needs have kept orders and shipments ofsemiconductor manufacturing equipment at their highest levels in three years.
4
Production excluding energy, high-tech, and motor vehicles and parts, about70 percent of total IP, increased in all major market groups during the secondquarter; in June, only the output of consumer goods declined.  Businessequipment production moved up in June and rose at double-digit rates in boththe first and second quarters.  The output of defense and space equipment, whichfell in the first quarter, rose nearly 12 percent in the second quarter.  Theproduction of business and construction supplies was unchanged in June, butthis pause came on the heels of several months of solidly increasing output. Nondurable materials production was also unchanged in June, while the outputof durable materials posted another increase.
In June, capacity utilization for total industry was 77.2 percent, 3.2 percentage
points above its cyclical low in June 2003 but still 3.9 percentage points belowits 1972–2003 average.
5  The operating rates for downstream industries were
farther below their long-run averages than those for upstream industries. Indeed, rates for a few significant upstream industries—including iron oremining, organic chemicals, pulp and paperboard, petroleum refining, and
semiconductors—exceed 90 percent and are well above historical averages.

According to anecdotal reports, bottlenecks have emerged in the transportation
sector.  Truck production has been below replacement needs since mid-2000except for a brief period in 2002.  As a consequence, the fleet has agedconsiderably, and capacity is quite tight; moreover, federal rules that restrict thenumber of hours a driver can be on the road have only exacerbated the situation. The combination of tight capacity along with higher diesel fuel prices and drivershortages has encouraged many large trucking companies to increase their use ofrailroads to ship truck trailers.  So far this year, the substitution of rail fortrucking, together with rising imports and exports, has significantly raised thevolume of intermodal traffic—the containers and truck trailers shipped byrail—and has caused some considerable delays, especially at Union Pacific.
Motor Vehicles
Light vehicle sales rebounded to an annual rate of 17.2 million units in July after
having dropped off sharply in June.  General Motors accounted for more than60 percent of the overall increase, and confidential data indicate that almost allof the gain in that company’s sales was in retail.  According to the latest reportfrom J.D. Powers and Associates, the average incentive per vehicle rose from$2,330 to $2,400 over the first four weeks of July.  Ford and GM, in particular,recently introduced enhanced deals on their large light-truck models. Manufacturers will probably continue to offer substantial discounts on their2004 model-year lineup to clear out stocks in advance of the arrival of 2005model-year vehicles late in the third quarter.  However, despite the rise inincentives, the Michigan survey reports that car-buying attitudes have dimmedbecause respondents are concerned about financing rates.
Business demand for motor vehicles has remained firm.  So far this year, both
fleet sales of light vehicles and sales of medium and heavy trucks have come inabove the average for 2003.  In light of the current tight freight situation and therecent move by haulers to replace their aging fleets, demand should retain somemomentum.  Industry contacts report that producers of medium and heavy trucksexpect solid sales in the second half of 2004.  Indeed, in July, the three-monthmoving average of medium and heavy truck orders remained high, signalingcontinued strength in demand.  
Total motor vehicle production in the second quarter was 11.8 million units,
more than 500,000 million units below the first-quarter pace and the lowest levelin a year.  Nonetheless, inventories remained elevated at 78 days’ supply for thesecond quarter.  Stocks of light trucks, at 2.2 million units, account for all of theexcess inventory.  With strong sales in July, inventories were pared back to 73days’ supply.  The latest schedules from automakers show that the rate forthird-quarter assemblies will be about the same as the second-quarter rate, anindication that producers need solid sales to further reduce their inventoryoverhang.

6. In the 2004 annual revision, the BEA re vised the personal saving rate noticeably
downward beginning in mid-2002, largely because of  substantial downward revisions to personal
income from assets and transfer payments.  For the first quarter of 2004, the saving rate is now
1.0 percentage point lower than previously published.Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending slowed sharply in the second quarter, increasing at anannual rate of just 1.0 percent after having advanced 4.1 percent in the firstquarter.  Although outlays for services continued to expand at a solid rate in thesecond quarter, expenditures for goods declined sharply.  The sluggish rise inspending was accompanied by a slight deceleration in real disposable personalincome—held back by rising food and energy prices—and a decline in equityvalues.
Total real personal consumption expenditures slumped 0.9 percent in June.  As
noted above, sales of cars and trucks dropped sharply to their lowest levels sinceFebruary 2003.  At the same time, spending on other goods declined 1/4 percentas expenditures on food fell for a third consecutive month, outlays for appareldropped, and spending in most other goods categories was also weak.  Someretailers have attributed the moderation in spending to unseasonably cool andwet weather in June.  Expenditures on services also slowed in June as spendingon household electricity and gas moderated.
Recent indicators provide some evidence that spending may have perked up in
July.  As noted above, purchases of light motor vehicles bounced up.  Inaddition, sales at the largest chain stores are reported to have been brisk.  Andthe July readings of consumer sentiment from both the Michigan SurveyResearch Center and the Conference Board increased and are consistent withgains in spending. 
Real disposable income was unchanged in June, damped by higher energy prices
and lower wage and salary disbursements.  Real disposable income rose at anannual rate of 2.9 percent for the second quarter as a whole.  Nonetheless, thegain in household income outpaced the increase in consumer spending lastquarter and boosted the personal saving rate 0.5 percentage point, to1.7 percent.
6  Although a lackluster stock market has kept increases in household
wealth below the pace of income growth this year, the ratio of household wealth
to income remains well above its historical average.
Housing Markets
Although housing construction dipped in June, permits and sales remained
robust, and recent indicators point to solid demand in July.  New single-familyhomes were started at an annual rate of 1.49 million units in June, aconsiderably slower pace than in April and May.  However, a substantial

7. The staff’s second-quarter estimate of the increase in spending on equipment and software
is about 0.3 percentage point higher than the BEA’s advance estimate.  The upward revision is
based on revised June data for shipments of capital goods and new information about aircraft
expenditures, which became available after the NIPA report. increase in the permit backlog in June points to a rebound in starts in July.  The
multifamily sector exhibited a similar pattern:  Starts declined in June, but thepermit backlog rose, a sign that a bounceback in July is likely.    
Home sales remained strong in June.  Sales of existing homes increased
2 percent, to an annual rate of 6.95 million units, the highest pace on record.  Inaddition, new homes sold at an annual rate of 1.33 million units in June, just atouch lower than the record high posted in May.  
Recent indicators suggest that housing demand will hold up reasonably well in
the near term.  Although the four-week moving average of mortgageapplications to purchase homes has trended down since mid-May, the recentlevels are still high by historical standards.  And the thirty-year fixed mortgagerate, which has averaged 6.0 percent since the beginning of July, remainsrelatively low.  Moreover, consumers’ homebuying attitudes in July remainedwithin the favorable range that has persisted for the past couple of years.
Home prices have continued to rise rapidly.  In June, the average price of
existing homes sold was up almost 10 percent from the year-earlier level.  Theaverage price of a new home advanced 9-1/2 percent during the twelve monthsended in June, and the constant-quality price index for new homes, whichcontrols for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, andother readily measurable attributes, was 8-1/4 percent higher than it was a yearearlier, the fastest rate of increase in more than twenty years.
Equipment and Software
Real business spending on equipment and software is estimated to have
increased at an annual rate of 10.2 percent in the second quarter, a little abovethe 8.0 percent pace posted in the first quarter.
7  The second-quarter pickup was
largely the result of a bounceback in spending on transportation equipment. After having risen at a robust rate for several quarters, real outlays forequipment excluding transportation items rose at a more moderate rate lastquarter.  The deceleration in spending was most pronounced for non-high-techequipment.  Still, fundamentals continue to send strong signals about investmentprospects in general:  Business output is expanding, financing costs remain low,and the corporate sector has accumulated a large cushion of liquid assets.
In the high-tech sector, real outlays increased at an annual rate of 20.4 percent
in the second quarter after having risen around 14-1/2 percent in the first

available for the BEA’s advance release; the BEA reported a 5-1/2 percent rate of increase.quarter.  Gains in real spending on computers and peripherals accelerated from
their sluggish first-quarter pace amid reports of strong replacement demand forPCs.  Outlays for communications equipment skyrocketed in the second quarter,posting a 37-1/2 percent advance.  The BEA’s outsized figure reportedly isbased on source data from the International Trade Commission that point to asurge in imports of telecommunications equipment in April and May.  However,in May and June, declines in orders for communications gear, which reversed asizable portion of their earlier gains, suggested some renewed softness inshipments of this equipment in the near term.  Software investment slowedconsiderably in the second quarter.  Large firms like Microsoft and Oraclereported impressive gains in sales, but a host of smaller firms announceddisappointing earnings figures.  The smaller companies were surprised by last-minute deferrals of corporate outlays by customers that appeared to be waitingfor a shakeout among the major players in the industry before making theirpurchases.
In the transportation category, business spending on motor vehicles was flat in
the second quarter, while real aircraft investment is estimated to have increasedmoderately.  Aircraft expenditures continue to linger at levels far below thepeaks recorded a few years ago. 
Real spending on equipment excluding high-tech and transportation rose at an
annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, down sharply from the11.6 percent pace posted in the previous quarter.  Nominal orders and shipmentsin this broad category fell in both April and May before turning up noticeably inJune.  Even with the recent weakness, the increase in the backlog of orders eachmonth since February bodes well for this category in the current quarter.  Inearly July, steel-plate producers reported increased demand from manufacturersof farm equipment, ships, and railroad cars.  Moreover, the surveys ofmanufacturers by the Philadelphia and New York Federal Reserve Banks andthe most recent reading from the ISM pointed to a pickup in activity in July andsuggested that the second-quarter weakness in demand for capital equipment isunlikely to persist. 
Nonresidential Construction
We estimate that real business investment in nonresidential structures rose at an
annual rate of 7 percent in the second quarter but remained at a depressed level.

9. The “other” category includes religious, e ducational, lodging, amusement, recreation,

10. The BEA’s second-quarter estimate of  nonfarm inventory investment—$44.9 billion
(annual rate)—incorporated preliminary book-valu e data on inventories held by manufacturers of
durable goods in June.  Data on inventor ies held by manufacturers of nondurable goods,
wholesalers, and retailers in June were not av ailable in time for the advance report.  The most
recent Census figure on nondurable inventories differed little from the one that the BEApencilled in.other types of buildings more than offset a sizable decline in the power-
generation component.9
Recent indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential structures sectorpaint a mixed picture.  Although conditions in the office sector remain soft, theymay be bottoming out.  The office vacancy rate edged down in the secondquarter but remained elevated.  Office rents continued to decline in the firstquarter but did so less rapidly than during the previous year; property valuesposted a small increase in the first quarter after showing little change last  year. The vacancy rate for industrial space also ticked down in the second quarter.  Inthe retail sector, the vacancy rate also moved down in the second quarter; onbalance, vacancy rates for retail properties have been relatively low since thelate 1990s.  Retail property values recorded a small increase early this year afterposting more robust advances last year.  The upward trend in the number ofnatural gas drilling rigs in July suggested that spending on drilling and miningstructures is continuing to increase at a robust pace.  
Business Inventories 
With the June data on manufacturers’ inventory investment now in hand, we
estimate that real nonfarm inventories excluding finished motor vehicles rose atan annual rate of about $34 billion in the second quarter after a small rise in thefirst quarter.
10  The change in nonfarm inventory investment is estimated to have
boosted the change in real GDP by 0.4 percentage point in the second quarterafter having contributed 1.1 percentage poi nts in the first quarter.  Inventory
investment has been somewhat subdued relative to recent small decreases insales, and both book-value and NIPA inventory-sales ratios edged up butremained at fairly low levels.
According to the staff’s flow-of-goods system, days’ supply of inventories
edged up in June, largely as a result of the upswing in stocks of motor vehicles. Apart from motor vehicles and parts, only the inventories of paper andcommunications equipment appear elevated; in marked contrast to other goods,the days’ supply of communications equipment has fallen more than 17 percentsince early 2002 and now stands at its lowest level since April 2001.

Federal Government
The federal unified budget deficit appears to have stabilized in recent months as
the inflow of receipts has picked up.  In June, buoyant corporate income taxpayments caused receipts to jump 11 percent above the level posted a yearearlier.  Outlays, adjusted for financial transactions and payment timing shifts,were boosted by higher interest payments on the debt and rose 5-3/4 percentrelative to the year-earlier level.  Among non-interest outlays, Medicaid outlayssurged in June; some states may have accelerated 
payments in order to take
advantage of the temporarily higher reimbursement rates from the federal
government that expired at the end of that month.  Year-over-year increases indefense spending have recently begun to wane:  In June, defense outlays wereonly 7 percent above their level a year earlier; over the previous twelve months,they typically had shown annual increases of about 14 percent.  Daily data forJuly and early August suggest some acceleration again in the current quarter.
The Congress has made little progress on budget-related legislation.  The Senate
has managed to pass only one of the thirteen regular appropriations bills,compared with an average over the past decade of six bills passed before thesummer recess.  The defense appropriations bill cleared both houses andincludes a 7 percent increase in budget authority for programs outside the waron terrorism, along with a $25 billion downpayment for continued operations inIraq.  Neither corporate tax reform nor the extension of expiring individualincome tax provisions has seen much progress, in part because of persistentwrangling over PAYGO.
The Administration now projects a fiscal 2004 unified budget deficit of
$445 billion, compared with a $375 billion deficit in fiscal 2003.  TheAdministration projects that the deficit will decline to $331 billion next year,largely reflecting the end of the partial-expensing tax provision, the cyclicalimprovement in the economy, an assumed falloff in spending on operations inIraq, and an increase in the effective tax rate.  These factors lead to some furtherimprovement in the deficit in 2006 and little change thereafter.
State and Local Governments  
The staff estimates that real spending by state and local governments has risenat an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter, the largest increase sincethe first quarter of 2002.  Essentially all of the strength was the result of a surgein construction spending, which began in March.  Meanwhile, employment fella little in the second quarter after having risen during the previous six months.
Most signs point to overall improvement in state and local financial conditions. 
Standard and Poor’s upgraded three times as many state and local credits in thesecond quarter as it downgraded.  Many states report that revenues have come inhigher than expected in recent months, and general fund spending has been held

11. Forty-four states reported budget data.  Anal ysts at NCSL expect the aggregate year-end
balance to be revised down when information is available from the remaining states (California,Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, and North Carolina).in check.  An infusion of federal aid from the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2003 also bolstered general fund accounts during fiscal2004, which ended June 30 in forty-six states.  According to a preliminaryreport from the National Conference of  State Legislatures (NCSL), ending
general fund balances for fiscal 2004 rose to 5.4 percent of expenditures from3.7 percent at the end of fiscal 2003; this was the first increase since 2000.

Even so, many legislators remain wary about developments in fiscal 2005.  Inparticular, according to NCSL, outlays for Medicaid are expected to increasemore than 13 percent this fiscal year despite the many cost-containmentmeasures that were put into effect during the past three years.
Prices and Labor Costs   
Core CPI inflation has moderated substantially in recent months.  However, sizable increases in food and energy prices have continued to push up overallconsumer price inflation.
Consumer energy prices rose 2.6 percent in June after advancing 4.6 percent in
the previous month.  Although the gains were broad-based, in part because ofthe pass-through of high crude oil costs, the increases in gasoline prices wereespecially large.  The strength of demand for gasoline over the past year,combined with stagnant gasoline imports through June, left inventories quitelean in the second quarter.  In addition, higher production costs associated withhigher U.S. refinery utilization rates pushed up pump prices relative to crude oilprices through mid-July.  Since then, gasoline imports have begun to rise,bringing wholesale mark-ups down, and retail prices have continued to decline. Among other energy products, natural gas markets softened a bit in July.  ByJuly 23, inventories of natural gas had risen to a level 3.1 percent above theirlong-run average for this time of the year.  As a result, the spot price of naturalgas at Henry Hub finished the month a touch below its level at the end of June.
Consumer prices for food rose 0.2 percent in June, well below the 0.9 percent
spike posted in May.  Prices for dairy products advanced rapidly during the three months ending in June because herd reductions over the past couple ofyears hampered dairy farmers’ ability to meet the recent surge in demand.  Anextraordinary jump of 6.8 percent in May was followed by a 1.7 percentadvance in June, even though dairies increased milk supplies by boosting thefeed rates of their cows.  Crop reports so far this season point to bumperharvests for corn and soybeans, and grain prices have fallen in response.  Thisdevelopment has encouraged producers of meats and poultry, which use cornand soybeans as feed, to raise their output a bit.  As a result, increases in

consumer prices for meats and poultry also moderated in June.  Similarly,
increases in prices for food away from home, which also had ticked up in May,eased back in June to 0.2 percent.   Over the twelve months ending in June, foodprices rose 3.7 percent, a pickup of 1-1/2 percentage points from the precedingyear.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased just 0.1 percent in June after a
0.2 percent rise in May and larger increases in March and April.  The recentmoderation reduced the three-month change to an annual rate of 2.3 percent, asubstantial deceleration from the nearly 3 percent rate posted over the first threemonths of the year.  The slowing in core prices reflected a return to outrightprice declines for durable goods as well as smaller price increases for a varietyof services.  Over the past twelve months, prices of core goods and services rose1.9 percent, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the preceding year.
Core PCE price inflation, which did not pick up as much as its CPI counterpart
in February and March of this year, has also decelerated less than the CPI inrecent months.  The core PCE price index rose 0.1 percent in June, and thetwelve-month change was 1.5 percent.  This increase represents only a0.1 percentage point step-up from the twelve-month change a year earlier, alittle smaller than the 0.3 percentage point rise in core CPI inflation.  Themarket-based component of the core PCE price index increased 0.2 percent inJune, a bit more than the core CPI; however, over the past twelve months, themarket-based core PCE price index accelerated 0.4 percentage point.
The BEA’s recent annual revision made a large change to non-market-based
core PCE prices.  The level of nonmarket price inflation was boosted in 2002,and thus the index decelerated 0.4 percentage point in June, on a twelve-monthbasis.  This is a dramatic revision from the 0.8 percentage point increase in thetwelve-month change previously reported for May of this year relative to May2003.
The prices of goods purchased by businesses decelerated in June.  In particular,
capital equipment prices, which rose just 0.2 percent, were damped by sizabledeclines in prices of high-tech equipment.  Core intermediate materials pricesalso slowed in June, posting the smallest monthly increase yet this year. Likewise, commodity prices were little changed in June after having increasedfor several months.
More recently, however, commodity prices have resumed their rapid increases. 
The JOC industrials index rose 6.5 percent over the four weeks of July and wasup 3.8 percent from the July average during the first week of August.  Thebiggest increase has been in petroleum and metals prices, especially steel scrap. Demand for steel plate has been strong in recent weeks; in addition, the normal

seasonal drop-off in auto production has reduced the “cutouts” portion of steel-
scrap supplies .  Because strong demand from China and Korea had already
eroded steel-scrap inventories over the past year, the price response wasespecially sharp.  The Commodity Research Bureau price index, which excludesenergy and forest products, also rose in July.  
Inflation expectations receded in July, according to the Michigan Survey. 
Median year-ahead expected inflation dropped to 3.0 percent, 0.3 percentagepoint below the median in May and June.  Median expected inflation over thenext five to ten years also ticked down last month; at 2.8 percent, it is stillwithin the narrow range observed over the past two years.  
The information on labor costs released since the June Greenbook suggests little
movement in the overall rate of change in hourly compensation so far this year. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) for hourly compensation in private industryrose at an annual rate of 4.0 percent over the three months ending in June—similar to the average pace over the preceding year and a half.  In recentquarters, the rise in the wage and salary component of the index has moderated,but that slowing has been offset by sizable run-ups in benefits costs.
Over the three months ending in June, ECI wages and salaries rose at an annual
rate of 2.2 percent and held the twelve-month change in this component to2.6 percent.  In contrast, benefit costs, which jumped at an annual rate of10.9 percent over the first three months of the year, climbed 7.1 percent in theMarch-to-June period.  The year-over-year change in ECI benefits stood at7.3 percent in June—the fastest pace in twenty years.  The recent acceleration inbenefit costs stems largely from the ongoing rapid increases in costs forretirement and savings that employers are incurring as they replenish theirdefined-benefit pension reserves that had been depleted by the earlier slump inthe stock market.  At the same time, employer costs for health care havecontinued to rise rapidly, although the increase of 8.1 percent over the twelvemonths ending in June was down slightly from the double-digit increase postedover the preceding twelve-month period.      Based on the NIPA data on employee compensation for the second quarter of2004, the staff estimates that the BLS Productivity and Cost release for thesecond quarter will show an increase of 4.4 percent (annual rate) incompensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector after a rise of 4.2 percentin the first quarter.  With productivity estimated to have slowed in the secondquarter, we believe that unit labor costs increased faster last quarter than in thefirst quarter.

Appendix
Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts
The annual revision of the national inco me and product accounts (NIPA), released on
July 30, affected data back to 2001.  The revision allows the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis (BEA) to incorporate more-compr ehensive source data, including data from
tax records and from economic surveys.  From 2000:Q4 to 2004:Q1, the average annualrate of increase of real GDP is unchanged at 2.5 percent, and revisions to year-to-year
growth rates were small.  Nevertheless, the portrait of the business cycle changed inimportant ways.  The 2001 downturn and the s ubsequent recovery are both milder than
previously estimated.  In the previously published estimates, real GDP peaked in the
fourth quarter of 2000 and then decreased in each of the next three quarters; in therevised estimates, real GDP decreased in th e first quarter of 2001 but increased in the
second before decreasing again in the third quarter.  The cumulative decline in real
GDP during these three quarters is now estimated to have been 0.4 percent, well belowthe average 2.3 percent drop in real GDP during post-1955 recessions.  From the thirdquarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2004, the revised estimates show that real GDPincreased at an average annual rate of 3. 3 percent, compared with the previously
estimated rate of 3.4 percent.
For 2001, the largest contributor to the upward revision to real GDP was state and local
consumption and investment, but most other components also contributed.  For 2002,the largest contributors to the downward revisions were spending on equipment and
software and personal consum ption expenditures (PCE).  For 2003, the slight upward
revision was attributable to small and mostly  offsetting revisions to many components. 
The revised estimate of real GDP in the first quarter of 2004 reflected the BEA’s
introduction of an improved methodology for accounting for the production of light
trucks.  The new procedure uses unit production data as well as FRB seasonal factorsand is similar to the BEA’s methodology for automobiles.  The new figures now showthat real gross motor vehicle output increased at  an annual rate of 8.8 percent in the first
quarter rather than declining 8.2 percent as reported earlier; the revised estimate isbroadly consistent with our estimate that  industrial production of new motor vehicles
increased at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the first quarter.  
The revisions to real GDP imply little change to the trend increase in output per hour in
the nonfarm business sector in recent years.  However, we expect that the Bureau of
Labor Statistics will show a new pattern of productivity changes when it releases its
revised data on August 10.  Measured from f ourth quarter to fourth quarter, the NIPA
data imply an upward revision to the growth rate of labor productivity of 0.2 percentage
point in 2001, a downward revision of 0.6 percentage point in 2002, and an upward
revision of 0.2 percentage point in 2003.
The annual NIPA revision also included new estimates of income-related measures. 
Gross domestic income (GDI) was revised down in 2001 and revised up in 2002 and2003.  These revisions, combined with tho se for GDP, changed the pattern of the
statistical discrepancy (GDP-GDI)—most noticeably, it is now estimated to have begunnarrowing in 2001 and has remained in positive territory since 2002:Q3.  Among thecomponents of personal income, the BEA’s es timates of private wages and salaries, a
major source of revisions in previous annua l revisions, were little changed.  However, 
II-A-2
II-A-3
other components of personal income were revi sed substantially.  In particular, the BEA
revised up its estimate of employer contri butions to defined-benefit pension plans,
which boosted supplements to wages a nd salaries in 2002 and 2003; and it revised
down personal income receipts on assets in 2002 and 2003 (principally, interest anddividends).  Because personal tax paymen ts were little revised, the revisions in
disposable personal income (DPI) mimic the changes in personal income; by the end of
2003, the level of current-dollar DPI is $56.6 billion less than previously estimated. Taken together, the revisions to DPI and PCE added 0.1 percentage point to the
personal saving rate in 2001 but cut it s ubstantially in 2002 and 2003.  Corporate
economic profits were revised down in all th ree years as upward revisions in before-tax
profits were more than offset by dow nward revisions in capital consumption
allowances.  As a result, the profit share as a percent of GNP (excluding FederalReserve Banks) was revised down in all three years.    
Overall, our view of core inflation over the past several years is little affected by the
new data.  Core PCE prices now decelerate slightly less from 2001 to 2003.  Morerecently, the level of core inflation is a little higher than before, and its turning point
occurs one quarter earlier.

Domestic Financial Developments
Overview
Over the intermeeting period, the market’s expected path for the federal funds
rate shifted down and longer-term interest rates declined somewhat in responseto weaker-than-expected economic data releases.  Still, market participants arevirtually certain that the FOMC will raise the federal funds rate 25 basis pointsat the August meeting and have priced in 75 basis points of tightening betweennow and year-end.  Stock prices declined over the intermeeting period, whilerisk spreads on corporate bonds were little changed.
Corporate debt growth has picked up recently on the strength of short-term
financing.  Household debt growth has sl owed from its double-digit pace in the
first quarter but has remained relatively brisk.
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields
The FOMC’s decision to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at the
June meeting was widely anticipated.  However, the accompanyingstatement—which characterized recent inflation as partly the result of transitoryfactors and retained language indicating that the pace of policy tightening couldbe measured—led investors to expect a more gradual pace of tightening.  Thatshift in the expected policy path was subsequently reinforced by economic datareleases that were softer, on net, than the market had expected, although thegenerally favorable economic outlook conveyed in the Chairman’s monetarypolicy testimony provided some offset.  Over the intermeeting period, federalfunds and Eurodollar futures rates declined on net by 20 to 40 basis pointsbeyond the very near term.  Options prices suggest that the declines reflectedreduced odds on particularly rapid increases in the funds rate.  Marketparticipants now expect the funds rate to reach about 2 percent by the end of thisyear and 3-1/4 percent by the end of 2005.  A recent survey suggests that marketparticipants also anticipate that at the August meeting the FOMC will continue
to view risks to the outlook for both economic growth and inflation as balancedand will retain the “measured pace” language—or some variant.
Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasuries moved down with
the change in policy expectations over the intermeeting period, declining 15 to25 basis points on net.  Similar decreases in yields on inflation-indexed Treasurysecurities decreased a bit less, leaving inflation compensation down slightly. Implied volatilities of Treasury bond prices increased a bit over the intermeetingperiod.
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates
Despite generally strong earnings reports for the second quarter, major stock
price indexes fell 3 to 9 percent on net over the intermeeting period, with theNasdaq index leading the decline.  Market participants had apparently expected
III-2
III-3
even stronger second-quarter results and were disappointed by the cautious
revenue outlooks from some major companies.  Steadily rising oil prices alsocontributed to the declines in stock prices.
Even as stock prices broke through their 2004 lows, expected and realized
volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 remained muted.  At thesame time, the twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio for firms in the S&P500 ticked up, and its spread over a long-run Treasury yield, a rough measure ofthe equity premium, widened a bit further.
Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined roughly
in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasuries over the intermeetingperiod.  As a result, risk spreads have changed little, as expectations of more-moderate earnings growth evidently have not shaken the view that corporatecredit quality will remain strong.  Risk spreads on commercial paper haveremained low.
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality
Based on results for the 400 firms in the S&P 500 that have already reported
second-quarter earnings, operating earnings per share for the S&P 500 areestimated to have risen about 25 percent from four quarters earlier.  Althoughmore than two-thirds of the reports exceeded consensus estimates, this fractionwas below that posted in recent quarters.  In addition, analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead corporate earnings have hardly budged of late after several months ofstrong upward revisions.
Credit quality of nonfinancial firms has remained strong.  Among the recent
news on credit quality, upgrades outpaced downgrades in the second quarter--thefirst net upgrade since 1998--and the bond default rate has remained very low. A forecast of aggregate year-ahead default rates based on the KMV model alsohas changed little in recent months, holding at its lowest level since the late1990s.  Expected default rates have dropped substantially for the vast majority offirms but have remained elevated for a troubled minority. 
Business Finance
Gross bond issuance has slowed in recent months.  Given the steady pace of
bond retirements, net bond issuance was close to zero in the second quarter andwas negative in July, as nonfinancial firms continued to rely on robust earnings,shorter-term debt, and ample cash assets to fund their investments.
In contrast, short-term debt has continued its turnaround.  Net issuance of
commercial paper has been robust in recent months, reportedly boosted byincreased merger activity.  C&I loans on banks’ books were about unchanged in
III-4
III-5
III-6
III-7
the second quarter after thirteen consecutive quarterly declines and appear to
have expanded in July.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer OpinionSurvey, banks continued to ease lending terms and standards, and nearly half ofthe responding banks, on net, reported stronger demand for C&I loans over thepast three months.  Banks pointed to ri sing accounts receivable, inventories, and
capital expenditures among their loan customers as factors contributing toincreased loan demand.  With the rebound in short-term credit, total net debtfinancing for nonfinancial firms picked up in July from its weak second-quarterpace.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms has been sluggish in recent
months.  The pace of IPOs has risen, but most deals have been small, and nearlyhalf were sold at prices below their filing ranges.  At the same time, equityretirements appeared to have picked up in the second quarter, leaving net equityissuance more firmly negative.  Completions of cash-financed mergers totaled$7 billion at a monthly rate, a 50 percent increase over the first-quarter volume,and a spate of new deals announced in July indicates that merger completionswill remain elevated.  Stock repurchases are estimated to have been robust againin the second quarter; they have been buoyed by ample corporate profits andcash holdings and will be boosted a bit over the next couple of years byMicrosoft’s recently expanded share repurchase program.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have grown at a robust 9 percent pace
in the second quarter, a view based largely on the strength of CMBS issuance,which totaled a near-record $25 billion.  CMBS deals completed in July, alongwith those now in the pipeline, indicate continued strength in the current quarter. CMBS credit quality has remained solid, as delinquency rates on CMBS issuesedged down again in June, and CMBS spreads have remained low.  REIT equityprices rose slightly over the intermeeting period, remaining well above theirsecond-quarter lows.  The ratio of net operating income to price on commercialproperties fell in the second quarter, and its spread over the real long-runTreasury rate narrowed further, a move consistent with declining risk premiumson commercial real estate assets.
Household Finance
Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages declined about 25 basis points
over the intermeeting period, and the spread between rates on fixed- andadjustable-rate mortgages narrowed a bit.  However, at around 190 basis points,this spread remains relatively wide and has likely continued to fuel ARMoriginations, which have been climbing sharply since the beginning of the year. Although the growth rates of mortgage and consumer credit are estimated to
III-8
III-9
III-10
III-11
have slowed somewhat in the second quarter, household debt growth has
remained strong.
Household credit quality continues to be solid.  The financial obligations ratio is
estimated to have ticked down further in the second quarter, as a decline in theaverage interest rate on household debt more than offset an increase in the ratioof debt to disposable income.  In addition, delinquency rates on securitizedcredit card pools, as well as those on auto loans at captive finance companies,stayed at relatively low levels in the second quarter.  A more up-to-date measure,household bankruptcy filings, has consistently been a shade lower than its year-ago levels but has remained somewhat elevated. 
Growth in household wealth appears to have stalled.  The combination of lower
stock prices and the likely continued sl owing of house price appreciation suggest
that the ratio of household net worth to disposable income was about unchangedin the second quarter.  Despite the lackluster performance of stock prices, flowsinto equity mutual funds were strong in July, albeit at a slower pace than earlierin the year.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed in July, as new capital
issuance dropped back from a very rapid pace in June.  The issuance of short-term debt jumped in June, as it typically does, to cover budget shortfalls at theend of the fiscal year; but it rose only to about half its year-ago pace, as fiscalpositions of states and municipalities have improved.  
Yields on highly rated municipal bonds declined roughly in line with Treasuries
over the intermeeting period, and measures of municipal bond credit qualityimproved.  The spread between yields on BBB-rated and AAA-rated municipalbonds declined to its lowest level since 2001, and upgrades of municipal bondscontinued to outpace downgrades.
Treasury and GSE Finance
The federal budget situation showed continued signs of improvement over the
intermeeting period.  The $19 billion surplus for June exceeded consensusexpectations.  Market participants expect favorable year-over-year comparisonsof budget data in July and August because of improving receipts and the adverseeffect of the 2003 fiscal stimulus package on last year’s monthly budgetnumbers.  In its midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasury retained thereopenings of ten-year nominal securities but indicated it might trim auctionsizes for coupon securities if the budget situation continues to improve.
III-12
III-13
Over the intermeeting period, the GSEs weathered a slew of negative news about
their earnings, accounting practices, and regulatory compliance.  In addition,investors shrugged off Fannie Mae’s decision in mid-July to break with itspreviously announced calendar of benchmark debt issuance.  Indeed, yieldspreads on GSE-issued bonds relative to comparable-maturity Treasuriesnarrowed substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period, and their stockprices outperformed broad equity market indexes.
Money and Bank Credit
The growth of M2 slowed sharply in June to about a 1-1/2 percent pace, and the
aggregate is estimated to have contracted slightly in July.  The deceleration wasdue mainly to weaker liquid deposit growth, which likely reflected a moderationin mortgage refinancing activity.  In addition, retail money market fund assetsresumed their more-than-two-year downward trend in June and July.  Theslowdown in M2 would have been even more pronounced if not for a spike incurrency demand from Russia and Iraq.
While real estate lending at banks has slowed of late, the growth rates of
business and consumer loans (adjusted for securitization) have picked up. Excluding the effects of sizable litigation-related provisions at two large bankingfirms, second-quarter net income at large bank holding companies remained verystrong.  Loan-loss provisions continued to decline, reflecting furtherimprovements in asset quality.

Appendix
July 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
The July 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and
households over the past three months.  In a ddition, the survey queried banks about the
extent to which the recent developments in  the bond markets have affected their C&I
lending patterns.  Responses were received from fifty domestic and nineteen foreign
banking institutions.
Both domestic banks and U.S. branches a nd agencies of foreign banks further eased
lending standards and terms for C&I loans over the past three months.  A small netfraction of domestic institutions also re ported an easing of lending standards for
commercial real estate loans, while standards fo r this type of loan at foreign institutions
were essentially unchanged.  In July, the ne t proportion of domestic banks that reported
stronger demand for C&I loans was a bit higher th an in April.  But a considerably larger
net fraction of domestic banks reported st ronger demand for commercial real estate
loans compared with the April survey.  Foreign respondents indicated a sharp
turnaround in C&I loan demand over the past three months; in contrast, demand forcommercial real estate loans at these ins titutions was reportedly unchanged over the
survey period.  In the household sector, a notable net fraction of domestic banks
reported an easing of credit standards on resi dential mortgage loans.  The demand for
this type of loan was about unchanged, on net, whereas demand for consumer loans of
all types reportedly deteriorated over the past three months.
Lending to Businesses
In the July survey, both domestic and fore ign institutions reported a further net easing
of credit standards on C&I loans.  On net,  about one-fourth of domestic banks indicated
that they had eased standards for large a nd middle-market business borrowers over the
past three months, roughly the same net percenta ge as in the April survey.  In contrast,
only 4 percent of domestic institutions, on ne t, eased their lending standards for small
firms, a notable decline from the 20 percent net easing reported in April.  The netpercentage of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having eased
their lending standards for C&I loans rose from 30 percent in April to 42 percent in the
current survey.
Domestic and foreign respondents also indicated that they had eased a number of
lending terms on business loans over the past three months.  On net, 45 percent ofdomestic commercial banks reported that they  had lowered spreads of loan rates over
their cost of funds for large and middle-market firms, and more than one-fourth, on net,reported having done so for small firms.  Among foreign institutions, more than one-
half of respondents, on net,  reported having narrowed spreads on their C&I loans over
the past three months.  In addition, sizable  net fractions of both domestic and foreign
institutions reported that they had eased cove nants on C&I loans, especially for loans to
large and middle-market firms. As in the April survey, domestic and foreignrespondents indicated that they had eased terms on credit lines, both by increasing thesize of credit lines and by reducing their cost.  
III-A-2
About 90 percent of domestic and almost 70 percent of foreign respondents cited more
aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important
reason for easing lending standards and terms over the previous three months.  Inaddition, about three-fourths of domestic and foreign institutions pointed to a more
favorable economic outlook as a reason for easing their business lending policies. Domestic institutions also frequently pointed to improvement in industry-specificproblems and increased tolerance for risk as reasons for their move toward a less
stringent lending posture.  A small number of domestic banks that tightened their 
business lending standards or terms over the p ast three months generally cited a reduced
tolerance for risk or a worsening of industry-specific problems.
 
C&I loan demand.   On net, one-third of domestic banks reported an increase in
demand for C&I loans from large and middle- market borrowers over the past three
months, a slightly higher net percentage than  in the April survey; about 45 percent also
reported stronger loan demand from small firms.  In addition, almost one-half ofdomestic respondents reported an increase in inquiries from potential businessborrowers over the same period, about th e same fraction as in the April survey. 
Domestic respondents that experienced stronger loan demand pointed to theirborrowers’ increased financing needs for accounts receivable and inventories as well asfor investment in plant and equipment.  In the current survey, demand for businessloans was also stronger at branches and ag encies of foreign banks, which in April
reported a weakening in demand.  More th an one-fourth of these institutions reported
stronger demand in July, most frequently attributing it to an increase in customer needsfor M&A financing.  These survey results ar e consistent with bank credit data, which
show a notable pickup in the growth of C&I loans in recent months. 
In light of the sharp decline in net bond issuance in the second quarter, a special
question on business financing asked banks about  the extent to which developments in
the bond market had affected their C&I le nding.  Although only 12 percent of domestic
banks reported a moderate reduc tion in loan paydowns, more than one-fifth of foreign
respondents noted that the decline in bond i ssuance caused a moderate or a substantial
reduction in the paydowns of C&I loans.
Commercial real estate lending.   On net, 8 percent of domestic banks reported that
they had eased lending standards on commercia l real estate loans over the past three
months, about the same net proportion as in the April survey.  The net percentage ofdomestic banks that experienced an increase in  demand for this type of loan moved up
from 20 percent in April to 32 percent in July.  In contrast, demand for commercial realestate loans at foreign institutions was repor tedly unchanged, on net, over the past three
months.
Lending to Households
The net proportion of banks indicating increased willingness to make consumer
installment loans declined to 8 percent in  July from 17 percent in the April survey. 
Standards for approving applications for cred it cards and other consumer loans, as well
as most terms on these loans, were unchanged, on net, in the July survey.  Demand forconsumer loans of all types reportedly slack ened over the past three months: On net, 
III-A-3
15 percent of banks experienced weaker cons umer loan demand in the current survey,
compared with 22 percent of institutions, on net, that reported stronger demand in April.
In the current survey, 9 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had eased
credit standards on residential mortgage loans, about the same net percentage as in
April.  Reported demand for residential real  estate loans was about unchanged, on net.

U.S. International Transactions
Trade in Goods and Services
The U.S. international trade deficit shrank to $46.0 billion in May from
$48.1 billion in April (revised).
In May, the value of exports of goods and services increased 2.9 percent to a
record high, with exports of goods more than accounting for the entire rise, asexports of services edged down slightly.  The increase in the value of exportedgoods was driven by increases in capital goods and industrial supplies.  Exportsof agricultural and automotive products also edged up, whereas exports ofconsumer goods dropped a bit.  At an annual rate, the average value of exportedgoods and services in April and May was about 16 percent above thefirst-quarter level.  The increase was widespread with all major trade categoriesregistering increases, particularly industrial supplies, capital goods, andservices.
The value of imports of goods and services rose 0.4 percent in May, as an
increase in imports of goods more than offset a slight decrease in services. Within goods, imports of industrial supplies and automotive products showedthe largest increases.  Imports of capital goods and foods also edged up.  Importsof consumer goods, however, fell.  Oil imports were little changed as anincrease in price offset a decrease in volume.  At an annual rate, the averagevalue of imported goods and services in April and May was about 15 percentabove the first quarter level.  The rise was widespread across most majorcategories of trade with the main exception of oil, which fell.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Non-oil imports.  In June, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of
core goods remained unchanged from their May levels, following seven
consecutive monthly increases.  After dropping 0.4 percent in May, prices ofimported foods fell another 0.5 percent in June.  After two months of largeincreases, prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies ticked down 0.1 percent. Prices of imported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) alsoedged down 0.1 percent, whereas prices of imported consumer goods wereunchanged.  Import prices of automotive products rose 0.2 percent.  Prices ofimported computers and semiconductors decreased 0.1 percent.  
In the second quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of imported core goods
increased 3.5 percent at an annual rate.  Much of this increase was concentratedin the commodity-intensive categories of industrial supplies and foods, feedsand beverages. 
Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil edged down 1 percent in June after surging
nearly 10 percent in May.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude oil averaged $38 per barrel in June, but rose steadily in July to averagemore than $40 per barrel for the month.  On August 4, the spot price of WTIclosed at $42.83 per barrel.  Recent oil price increases have been driven in partby concerns about oil production in Russia, where authorities have seized themain production assets of Yukos, Russia’s largest oil company.  Reports suggestthat, to pay Yukos’ tax bill, these assets may be sold, which may bankrupt thecompany and could lead to supply disruptions.  In addition, strong world oildemand, violence in the Middle East, and doubts about the reliability of oilsupplies from Nigeria and Venezuela continue to keep upward pressure on oilprices.
Exports.   In June, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods
fell 0.6 percent, following nine consecutive monthly increases.  Falling 4.6
percent in June, prices for exported agricultural products (particularly soybeans)accounted for most of the decline.  Prices of exported industrial supplies alsocontributed to the decline, falling 0.6 percent.  Prices of exported capital goods(excluding computers and semiconductors) rose 0.2 percent in June.  Prices ofexported semiconductors fell 0.6 percent.  Prices for all other major categoriesof exports were unchanged. 
In the second quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of exported core goods
increased 6.0 percent at an annual rate.  Agricultural products and industrialsupplies were the main contributors to this quarterly increase.

U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) weakened in May.  After averaging over$40 billion per month in the first four months of the year, private foreign inflowsinto U.S. securities in May totaled only $22 billion.  Most of the decline in Mayowed to a shift in equities (line 4d) from net purchases to net sales.  Demand foragency securities (line 4b) and corporate debt securities (line 4c) remainedrobust but not spectacular.  Private foreign purchases of Treasury securities (line4a) remained weak; these purchases, after totaling $66 billion in the first quarter,amounted to a combined $6 billion in April and May. 
Net foreign official inflows (line 1) remained brisk at $18 billion in May, though
far below the white-hot pace of the first quarter, as Japan has not intervened inforeign exchange markets since March.  Partial data from the Federal ReserveBank of New York (FRBNY) suggest a further slowing, as monthly inflows
averaged $12 billion in June and July.                     .
U.S. investors acquired on net virtually no foreign securities (line 5) in May,
following unusually large acquisitions of $17 billion in April.  In what hasbecome the norm, U.S. investors purchased foreign equities and sold foreignbonds. 
The banking sector (line 3) recorded sizeable inflows in May, bringing year-to-
date flows to near balance.

Foreign Financial Markets
On net, the dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value against major foreign
currencies was little changed over the intermeeting period.  The dollar was alsolittle changed on balance against the currencies of our other important tradingpartners, as modest gains against a number of emerging Asian currencies wereoffset by losses against several Latin American currencies.    
The dollar fluctuated during the period, depreciating in response to the lower-
than-expected June U.S. employment and core CPI data reports early in theperiod, and appreciating in reaction to Chairman Greenspan’s semi-annualtestimony to Congress on July 20-21, which market participants interpreted asgenerally reflective of a positive outlook for the U.S. economy, as well asstronger U.S. consumer confidence and manufacturing surveys.  U.S. economicdata late in the period were more mixed, leading to a slight retracement in thedollar, but this loss was limited by several weaker-than-expected data releases ina number of foreign industrial economies. 
On balance, the dollar was mixed against major foreign currencies, appreciating 
3 percent against the yen, depreciating 2 percent against the Canadian dollar,and changing little on balance against sterling and the euro.  The yenexperienced a bout of broad-based weakness early in the period.  Analysts
IV-9
ascribed this weakness, in part, to commentary by Japanese officials that
reinforced the view that there would be no urgency to tighten monetary policy. In addition, investors expressed concerns about the duration of a slowdown inChina and its effects on the Japanese economy.  Economic data from Canadaduring the intermeeting period generally met or exceeded expectations, helpingto support the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.   
The European Central Bank left its policy rate unchanged at two meetings this
intermeeting period, as had been expected.  After the Bank of England decidedto leave its policy rate unchanged at its meeting in early July (as had also beenexpected), short-term sterling interest rates increased in response to stronger-than-expected U.K. retail sales data and the release of the minutes from theprevious meeting, which revealed that policymakers believed the British labormarket was tightening and that the economy had little spare capacity.  The Bankof England increased its policy rate 25 basis points, to 4.75 percent, at theAugust 5
th meeting.  Short-sterling rates declined modestly and sterling
depreciated slightly after the announcement, as market participants reportedlyinterpreted the BoE statement as indicating a less rapid pace of future rateincreases.  
IV-10
Market measures of the expected near-term path for monetary policy in other
foreign industrial economies were generally little changed on net, while (exceptfor Japan) such measures at farther horizons generally shifted down. Movements in long-term European and Canadian yields during the period oftenfollowed movements in U.S. yields, with Canadian yields showing net declinesin line with U.S. yields and European yields declining less.  In addition to weakU.S. data, market analysis attributed the net declines in global yields to investorconcerns about the effect of record oil prices on global economic activity.       
Equity indexes in most foreign industrial countries registered losses this period,
weighed down early in the period by the weak U.S. data and later by oil priceincreases and concerns about a softening outlook for the technology sector. Equity prices in Canada, an oil exporter, declined only modestly.  Technologyshares significantly underperformed broader indexes following disappointingearnings news from several major global technology and telecom corporations. 
Brazilian asset prices saw solid gains this period, with the Brazilian real up 2
percent, Brazil’s EMBI+ spread down about 60 basis points, and Brazil’s equityindex up about 7 percent.  Analysts attributed these gains in part to severalstronger-than-expected domestic data releases.  In addition, the Brazilian real
was supported following the release of the minutes of the July 20
th policy
meeting of Brazil’s central bank; market participants interpreted the minutes asindicating that policymakers have ruled out further interest rate cuts and thatthey would even consider undertaking rate hikes if inflation keeps accelerating. Mexican spreads also declined this period (although more modestly than theBrazilian spread) and the Mexican peso appreciated modestly against the dollar. The Mexican central bank decided to tighten monetary policy on July 23, citinginflation risks.  The Mexican stock market decreased slightly on balance.   
Emerging Asian equity prices were mixed; share prices in Korea and Taiwan
were weighed down by global declines in technology shares.  Russian equityprices declined sharply on balance over the period, led by a 40 percent declinein the share price of Yukos, the large Russian oil producer engaged in a disputewith the government over payment of back taxes.  A minor banking crisisexpanded slightly in Russia early in the intermeeting period when two majorbanks experienced significant deposit outflows.  The crisis appears to havesubsided, however, following government efforts to support liquidity and extenddeposit insurance to a broader category of banks.  On net, Russia’s EMBI+spread rose about 20 basis points over the period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Available data indicate that the major foreign industrial economies continued to
grow at a solid pace in recent months.  In Japan, gains in exports and householdexpenditures strengthened the expansion, while surveys of business andconsumer confidence were also favorable.  Indicators of economic activity inthe euro area suggest moderating growth in the second quarter.  Domesticdemand remained weak in Germany and strong in France.  In the UnitedKingdom, real GDP accelerated in the second quarter according to thepreliminary release.  Economic activity grew at a solid pace in Canada, led by asurge in investment.
High energy prices have contributed to maintaining consumer price inflation
elevated.  In Canada, headline inflation was unchanged at 2.5 percent.  Inflationin the euro area remained well above the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling.  In the UnitedKingdom, inflation edged up to 1.6 percent, but remained below the Bank ofEngland’s 2 percent inflation target.  Slight deflation persisted in Japan.
On August 5, in the United Kingdom, the Monetary Policy Committee increased
its policy rate 25 basis points to 4.75 percent, while, in the euro area, theEuropean Central Bank announced no change.
In Japan , recent indicators suggest that economic activity continued to expand
strongly.  Real exports surged 5 percent during the second quarter, while realimports were up about 3 percent.  Workers’ household expenditures fell in Junebut rose more than 3 percent during the second quarter and measures ofconsumer confidence continued to move up.  New car registrations bouncedback in July following a drop in the second quarter.  Industrial production fell1.3 percent in June, but was up sharply for the second quarter as a whole.  Theall-industries index of output rose 1.7 percent in April and May on averagecompared with the first-quarter average.  Core machinery orders, a leadingindicator of business fixed investment, fell 2.1 percent in May.  Despite themonthly decline, average orders for April and May were more than 9 percentabove the first-quarter average.
Labor market conditions continued to improve and consumer price deflation
remained mild.  While the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.6 percent inJune, employment increased during the second quarter and thejob-offers-to-applicants ratio moved up to 0.82 in June, an eleven-year high. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food butinclude energy) were flat in July from the previous month and were down 0.1percent from a year earlier.  Higher commodity prices helped to push wholesale
IV-13
prices up to 1.4 percent in June on an annual basis, the largest twelve-month rate
of increase since 1997.

The Bank of Japan's Tankan index of business conditions rose in June, with the
level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment among firms of allsizes and across all industries increasing to 0 from -5 in March.  The closelywatched index for large manufacturers improved from 12 to 22 over the sameperiod.  The June strengthening of the aggregate index was broadly based, with
increases for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers across all firm sizes.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won 49 seats in the Upper House
election on July 11, losing only one of its 50 contested seat.  The results left theruling coalition with control of 139 seats, more than the 122 seats needed tosecure a majority.  Following the results, Prime Minister Koizumi announced
IV-14
that he will stay in office and disclosed plans to reshuffle his cabinet in
September.
Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group and UFJ Financial Group announced in July
their intention to merge operations by September 2005.  If completed, themerger would create the world's largest financial firm by assets.  However,merger negotiations have been put on hold as UFJ appeals a Tokyo DistrictCourt injunction against the merger.  The court ruled that the new merger wouldbreach an earlier agreement for UFJ to sell its trust assets to Sumitomo Trust &Banking.
Indicators suggests that growth in the euro area has edged down from its first-
quarter pace of 2.3 percent.  Industrial production increased in April and May,led by German production of capital goods.  In Germany, over the same period,merchandise exports continued to grow at a rapid pace but imports also movedup, suggesting some moderation in the contribution of net exports to GDPgrowth from the very high first-quarter rate.  Euro-area retail sales dropped inMay but bounced back in June.  In Germany, June’s retail sales remained below the first-quarter average, pointing to continued weakness in domesticdemand.  In contrast, French consumption of manufactured goods surged inJune, indicating that household demand in France has remained solid.
The European Commission’s surveys of industrial and consumer confidence
were unchanged in July.  In Germany, the IFO business climate index fell inJune to a nine-month low, recovered somewhat in July but was still below boththe first and the second-quarter averages.  According to market research groupGfK, German consumer confidence was weaker than expected in July and is setto drop in August.  In France, conversely, the INSEE business confidence indexrose in July to a three-year high, confirming the strength of the French recovery.

The labor market remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate
unchanged at 9 percent in June .  Meanwhile, recent wage agreements in
Germany and France have seen labor unions accepting wage moderation andincreased working-time flexibility in exchange for no job cuts.
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area was unchanged at 2.4
percent in July, well above the ECB’s 2 percent target ceiling.  The rise ininflation since the first quarter was mainly the result of a surge in energy andadministered prices.  The ECB is closely monitoring price developments forsecond-round effects of these increases.  In June, core inflation, excludingenergy, food, alcohol, and tobacco edged up to 2.0 percent.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom  expanded 3.8 percent in the second quarter
according to the preliminary estimate.  Estimated output in the service sectorincreased at around the same pace as overall activity.  Despite declining in June,
IV-16
industrial production rose at a pace  roughly consistent with the initial estimate
in the second quarter.
Limited indicators for July point to somewhat slower growth on balance in the
third quarter.  The manufacturing PMI rose to its highest level since October1994 and consumer confidence inched up.  In contrast, business confidencedipped somewhat below the average level during the first half of the year. Services PMI ticked down for the third consecutive month, but continues toindicate strong expansion.  One of the leading surveys of retail sales suggeststhe pace of sales dropped.

According to the two leading private surveys, housing prices rose 21 percent in
the twelve months ending in July.  Household net mortgage and consumerborrowing remained elevated in June.
The labor market continued to be tight, as both the official-claims-based and the
labor-force-survey measures of the unemployment rate remained near theirlowest points since 1975.  The twelve-month consumer price inflation rate roseto 1.6 percent in June, still well below the Bank of England’s 2 percent target.
On July 22, the Bank of England announced upcoming changes to its operations
in money markets aimed at reducing volatility in overnight sterling interestrates.  The Bank plans to introduce standing lending and borrowing facilitieswith rates 25 basis points above and below the official repo rate.  Commercialbanks will be able to choose a positive average target level for the reservebalances that they will hold during the month-long maintenance period, and theBank will start paying interest (equal to the repo rate) on those balances.  TheBank will reduce the number of open market operations from up to four a day toonce a week, and change the maturity of the operations to one week.  The Bankintends to release further details in a consultative paper this fall, before enactingthe change.
In Canada , monthly GDP growth moved up to 0.3 percent in May from 0.1
percent in April, suggesting that the expansion continued in the second quarter. Growth was especially strong in the mining and oil and gas extraction sectorsdue to rising energy prices.  The end of public-sector labor disputes in May alsoled to a rebound in activity in education service.  Real exports increased 4.5percent on average in April and May from the first-quarter average, whilestrong domestic demand fueled an almost 6 percent jump in real imports overthe same period.  Imports of machinery and equipment were particularly strong,indicating a steep rise in business fixed investment.  Housing starts reached a
14-year high in the second quarter, showing the continued strength ofresidential investment.  In contrast, retail and wholesale trade continued to
shrink in May.   Employment increased steadily throughout the quarter, with
construction exhibiting large gains.

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In emerging Asia, buoyant external demand has continued to support robust
economic performance, although Chinese growth has slowed significantlyfollowing policy measures taken to temper the pace of investment.  Economicactivity in Latin America has remained fairly strong, boosted by manufacturingexports to the United States, particularly in Mexico, and by a pickup in domesticdemand in Brazil and Argentina.  Increases in energy and food prices havecontributed to a further rise in inflation across the developing world, butinflation rates are still moderate.
Real GDP growth in China slowed to just under 3 percent in the second quarter,
considerably lower than the double-digit pace maintained since the end of theSARS epidemic last year.  Chinese authorities’ efforts to slow investmentappear to have been effective; after soaring in the first quarter, investment wasroughly flat in the second quarter.  Money and loan growth have also beenchecked.  Indicators of personal consumption, however, show a pickup; growthof retail sales is now hovering around 15 percent on a twelve-month basis. Exports and imports so far have been surprisingly unaffected by the investmentslowdown, with twelve-month growth rates approaching 50 percent in recentmonths.
Inflation has moved up recently, with consumer prices rising 5 percent over the
twelve months ending in June.  However, excluding food prices, consumerprices have been nearly flat.  There are also signs that recent increases in rawmaterial and producer prices have flattened out.

Taiwan’s economy was supported by further growth in global high-tech
demand in the second quarter.  Indicators of production of high-tech goodscontinued to move upward, and orders for these goods reached record levels inrecent months.  Imports of electronic components and higher oil prices pushedthe trade balance into deficit in June, but for the second quarter as a whole thetrade surplus increased slightly, propelled by high-tech exports.  Drivenprimarily by the recent rise in energy prices, consumer price inflation hasstepped up but remains relatively low.

Incoming data for Korea  were mixed.  Indicators for domestic demand
suggested an improvement in sales, but consumer and business confidenceremained weak.  Industrial production fell in June as manufacturers of computerchips scaled back output after a surge earlier in the quarter.  The unemploymentrate has edged up to 3½ percent in recent months.  Inflation has also picked up,reflecting higher prices of oil and other commodities.  The trade and currentaccount surpluses moved lower in June but remained at high levels.  The Koreanparliament approved a stimulus package of more than $1½ billion in July, inpart directed toward increasing funding for small and medium-sized firms.

Incoming data from the ASEAN countries suggest continuing strength of
economic activity, fueled largely by external demand.  According to theadvance GDP release, Singapore’s economy is estimated to have grown 9percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, following three quarters ofdouble-digit growth.  For industrial production, the monthly pattern has beenvolatile, but average output levels available so far during the second quarter aresignificantly above their first-quarter averages, with the exception of Thailand. Indications are that ASEAN exports continued to rise in the second quarter but,in some cases, such as Thailand which is one of the more oil-dependenteconomies in the region, imports also have been increasing rapidly.  Inflationhas continued to increase in the region but generally remains moderate.  Asubstantial part of the acceleration in consumer prices is accounted for by risingfood prices, but other categories such as transport and communications, utilities,and services have also contributed.
Indonesia’s first-ever elections to directly elect a president were held in early

In Mexico, recent economic indicators have been generally consistent with a
continuation of robust economic growth led by manufacturing exports to theUnited States.  Industrial production declined in May following two very strongmonths, but the April-May average stood more than 1½ percent above the first-quarter average.  Exports rose at a quarterly rate of about 5½ percent in thesecond quarter, the fastest pace in more than four years, reflecting increases inboth oil and non-oil exports.  Second-quarter imports were up nearly 6 percent;imports of both consumer goods and capital goods accelerated, suggesting apickup in Mexican domestic demand.  Consistent with that, retail sales rosemore than ½ percent in May, with the April-May average up 1¼ percent fromthe first quarter. 
The Bank of Mexico (BOM) tightened monetary policy on July 23, raising the
"corto" (the daily amount that it shorts the interbank market) to 41 million pesosfrom 37 million pesos; one-month interest rates rose 45 basis points followingthe move.  The central bank cited rising inflation expectations and a recentincrease in core inflation (to above 3½ percent) as reasons for the policytightening.  In addition, in recent months, headline inflation has been running abit above the upper end of the BOM’s 2-4 percent target range.  The BOM hasnoted that the rise in inflation comes against the background of a rebound inMexican consumer and investment spending.

In Brazil , data releases pointed to continued expansion in economic activity
over the second quarter.  Average industrial production in April and May wasnearly 2½ percent above its first-quarter average.  The unemployment ratedeclined to about 11½ percent in June.  Although growth continued to be fueledlargely by net exports, there has been increasing evidence of a recovery indomestic demand.  The twelve-month increase in consumer prices was morethan 6 percent in June, above the 5½ percent mid-point of the inflation target forthis year.  In part, the most recent rise in inflation reflects hikes in domesticprices of energy and other government-regulated prices.  This has resulted in anincrease in one-year ahead expectations of inflation, but longer-termexpectations have moved up only a little.  Despite very high real interest rates,concerns about inflation prompted the central bank to maintain its policy rate at16 percent in its late July meeting; the rate has been at this level since April.

In Argentina , recent data releases suggest that the economic recovery has
continued, albeit at a more moderate pace.  Industrial production fell sharply inApril from a very high level in March, but picked up again in May.  Recentperformance suggests that the economy has not yet been severely affected bystructural problems in the country’s energy sector.  Twelve-month consumerprice inflation increased in recent months, to about 5 percent.  Argentina hascontinued to run sizable trade surpluses.  
Although Argentina has met all the quantitative targets outlined in its IMF
program by comfortable margins, performance has lagged in other areas, such asdebt restructuring, reform of federal-provincial fiscal relations, and bankcompensation. Given Argentina’s lack of progress in these key areas, the IMFmission that visited Buenos Aires in June has not yet recommended approval ofthe third review under the current program.  It is likely that Argentina will askfor waivers for these incomplete reforms, and the negotiation process with theIMF could prove to be protracted.

In Venezuela , the upcoming August 15 referendum on whether President
Chavez should be recalled remains on center stage.  Polls indicate that Chavez’spopularity has risen in recent months; analysts attribute this result to a fiscalexpansion financed by the oil boom. Monthly inflation declined to about1 percent in July, bringing the twelve-month change to nearly 22 percent.  Oilproduction is still believed to be about 15 percent below the level prevailingbefore a disruptive national strike in late 2002.

In Russia , real GDP increased at a robust pace of more than 6½ percent in the
first quarter.  More recent indicators of production have also been strong. Consumer price inflation decreased slightly to about 10 percent in the secondquarter.  The recent liquidity problems of Russian banks appear to havesubsided with the  passage of a supplementary deposit insurance arrangement. However, the tax-evasion dispute between the Kremlin and Yukos, a major oilcompany, has intensified, roiling world oil markets.  The authorities have seizedkey production facilities of Yukos, and the trials of two major shareholders havebegun.
