Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
Overview
The economic expansion appears to have regained some vigor after having
slowed in late spring.  The August labor market report showed a small upturn inhiring, and other indicators suggest a pickup in the pace of production and salesover the past couple of months.  Consumer spending rose sharply in July andappears to have held steady in August, and housing starts bounced back in Julyafter having dipped in June.  Orders and shipments of capital goods remained ona solid uptrend through July despite some softening in demand for high-techequipment.  Core price inflation moderated in June and July, and overallinflation in July was further damped by a decline in energy prices.
Labor Market Developments
The labor market continued to improve in August, with private payrolls rising
120,000 and the unemployment rate ticking down to 5.4 percent—nearly 1 percentage point below its recent peak in June 2003.  In addition, the payrollfigures for June and July were revised up, and as a result the deceleration inhiring no longer seems as abrupt as it appeared a month ago.  Still, privateemployers have added only 97,000 jobs per month on average over the pastthree months, a pace well below the 293,000 jobs per month over the threemonths ending in May.  In addition, survey evidence and the low level of thelabor force participation rate both suggest that households remain concernedabout a lack of employment opportunities.
Manufacturing employment rose again in August, as producers of durable goods
continued to post gains.  Employment also increased last month in construction,financial activities, and both business and nonbusiness services.   However,payrolls in the retail trade and information sectors fell again last month; joblosses in these industries in July and August largely reversed the gains of thesecond quarter.
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers was 33.8 hours
in August, unchanged from the upward-revised July level and a touch higherthan the average workweek in the second quarter.  Consequently, even with therelatively modest payroll gains in recent months, the level of aggregate hours ofproduction or nonsupervisory workers in August stood 0.8 percent above thesecond-quarter average (not at an annual rate).
In addition to the unemployment rate, a number of other indicators suggest that
significant slack remains in the labor market.  The employment-population ratio,which combines the unemployment rate and the participation rate, is up only alittle from its relatively low level in mid-2003.  In addition, the number ofpersons working part-time for economic reasons as a share of total employmenthas remained elevated.

1. For the week ending September 4, the four-week moving average of initial claims was
339,000.  Recent volatility in initial claims is due in  part to the effects of Hurricane Charley and
the difficulty in seasonally adjusting the initial claims series at the end of summer and the start ofthe school year. 
2. The staff estimates that upward revisions to  business inventory investment and net exports
will raise the growth of output in the nonfarm busin ess sector in the second quarter to an annual
rate of approximately 4 percent, compared with an increase of 3-1/2 percent in the most recent
BLS release.Survey evidence suggests that households perceive that the labor market
remains soft.  According to the Conference Board, households’ appraisals ofcurrent employment conditions have recovered a little from the low levels of lastyear but still are only at the levels that prevailed in 1994 and 1995.  However,households have become more optimistic that labor market conditions willimprove over the next twelve months, according to both the Michigan andConference Board surveys. 
Meanwhile, layoffs have continued to run substantially below their cyclical
peaks, but the pickup in hiring is still modest.  The four-week moving averageof initial claims for unemployment insurance has changed little, on net, in thepast several months, and layoff announcements have fluctuated within a narrowrange well below their highs of a few years ago.
1  Similarly, the Job Openings
and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) shows that the separations rate has stayedat a low level since falling sharply in 2001.  However, since the spring, theJOLTS hiring rate has been only a little above its average of the past two years. In addition, the JOLTS job openings rate has come up from the lows of 2003 butremains well below the levels of 2001.  On a more positive note, both theManpower survey and the National Federation of Independent Businessessurvey of small businesses indicate a net improvement in hiring plans over thepast year (not shown).
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that output per hour in the nonfarm
business sector increased at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the second quarterand has risen 4-1/2 percent over the past year; based on more-recent data, weexpect productivity growth in the second quarter to be revised up to an annualrate of 3 percent.
2  The BLS estimates that output per hour in the nonfinancial
corporate sector rose at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in the second quarter and4 percent over the past year.

Industrial Production
Total industrial output has increased moderately so far in the third quarter after a
drop in June.3  In August, industrial production was 5.2 percent above its year-
earlier level and a bit above the cyclical peak reached in 2000.  Within total IP,manufacturing output rose 0.9 percent in July and 0.5 percent in August.
4  In
contrast, the output of electric utilities declined significantly in each of thesemonths for weather-related reasons.
The increases in manufacturing production since the end of the second quarter
have been widespread.  The output of motor vehicles and parts jumped inAugust as assemblies rose from an annual rate of 11-1/2 million units in Juneand July to 12 million units in August.  In the high-tech sector, computerproduction continued to expand in August—albeit less rapidly than earlier in theyear—and the output of communications equipment posted its fourthconsecutive monthly increase.  However, production of semiconductor chips isnow estimated to have risen only modestly in June and July, and the increase inAugust was well below the pace earlier in the year as bloated inventories at Intellikely took a toll on production.
Production in other market groups (that is, excluding high-tech and motor
vehicles) has increased, on balance, in recent months.  The output of business

5. The manufacturing purchasing managers surveyed by the Institute for Supply
Management have noted rising prices for frei ght transportation in every month since March.equipment, which had risen sharply over the first half of the year, surged in July;
it fell back in August but was still appreciably above its second-quarter average. Elsewhere, the output of durable consumer goods has been soft in recentmonths, while the production of construction supplies, business supplies, andmaterials have all moved up, as is consistent with expanding production indownstream industries.
Despite the relatively steady rise in industrial production over the past year, the
industrial sector as a whole continues to exhibit considerable slack.  The overallcapacity utilization rate, at 77.3 percent in August, is still 3.8 percentage pointsbelow its 1972–2003 average.  But conditions vary considerably across theindustrial sector.  The rate of capacity utilization for industries in the finishedgoods stage of processing has come up from the record lows reached inmid-2003 but is still more than 4 percentage points below its long-run average. In contrast, the utilization rates among industries in the earlier stages ofprocessing are closer to their long-run averages, and the rates in somesignificant crude and primary processing industries—iron ore mining, organicchemicals, pulp and paperboard, and petroleum refining—exceeded 90 percentlast month and are well above historical averages.  Outside the industrial sector,anecdotal information continues to indicate tight capacity for truck and railshipping, which is not expected to abate in the near term.
5
The near-term indicators of high-tech manufacturing activity suggest thatconditions in this sector have softened somewhat.  In particular, Intel sharplylowered the midpoint of its revenue guidance for the third quarter as a result ofboth a weaker outlook for demand and an inventory correction by its customers. Intel and others in the industry have suggested that the back-to-school season forpersonal computers (PCs) has been softer than anticipated; Intel has alsoindicated that the slackening in demand for its products is worldwide andconcentrated in the consumer segment.  Gartner, an IT research and analysiscompany, expects unit shipments of servers to be flat in the third quarter, andalthough it has revised down its forecast for third-quarter unit shipments ofdesktop and mobile PCs, it still expects a pickup relative to the second quarter.
The forward-looking indicators of ma nufacturing production and reports from
the staff’s industry contacts have generally been positive.  Preliminary datasuggest that electricity generation for early September was up significantlyrelative to the previous month, and motor vehicle assemblies apparently areholding close to the elevated August pace.  The new orders diffusion index fromthe Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is useful for forecastingnear-term changes in industrial production, declined in August but remained

well above 50; more recently, the new orde rs diffusion index in the Empire State
survey turned back up in September.  And although the staff’s series on realadjusted durable goods orders has slipped since the spring, it was still at a highlevel in July.
Motor Vehicles
Sales of light vehicles fell in August to an annual rate of 16.5 million units after
having surged to 17.2 million units in July.  Taken together, the average pace ofsales in July and August was nearly 1/2 million units above that in the first halfof the year, an increase likely reflecting some strengthening in demand as wellas a further sweetening of incentives.  The latest report from J.D. Power andAssociates showed that the average incentive per vehicle was $183 larger inAugust than in the second quarter.  Industry contacts anticipate that sales inSeptember will be at an annual rate of about 17 million units (confidential).
Business-sector demand for motor vehicles remains strong.  Sales of medium
and heavy trucks climbed in July and August to their highest levels in fouryears, and industry contacts expect sales of these vehicles to remain vigorousover the remainder of the year.  Indeed, orders for medium and heavy truckshave been at an annual rate of about 600,000 units since the spring, nearly50 percent above the pace for 2003 as a whole.  Fleet sales of light vehiclesdeclined about 200,000 units in August, but their pace so far this year is stillabove the average of 2003.  
Despite the relatively robust pace of sales in recent months, inventories of light
vehicles (especially trucks) have remained high, and at the end of August, days’supply stood at 78.  The automakers have scheduled production in the fourthquarter at a 12.2 million annual rate; however, given the elevated level ofinventories, an underbuild would not be surprising.
Consumer Spending
After a slowdown in the spring, consumer spending appears on track to
accelerate in the current quarter.  Real PCE rose sharply in July, and theavailable data suggest that spending held fairly steady in August.  Althoughsales of light vehicles dropped back last month from July’s heady pace, nominalspending in the control category of retail sales—which excludes auto dealersand building material and supply stores—increased 0.2 percent.  Afteraccounting for the staff’s projection of price changes, we estimate that realspending on goods excluding cars and trucks rose 0.2 percent in August afterhaving jumped 0.9 percent in July.  Real expenditures on services moved up0.2 percent in July, according to the latest available data.  
Real disposable income has increased at a sluggish rate so far this year.  On the
basis of unemployment insurance tax records for the first quarter and labormarket data for the second quarter, the BEA now estimates that real DPI rose at

6. The drop in transfer payments primarily  reflected the BEA’s assessment that the
expiration on June 30 of the temporary increase in  the federal share of Medicaid costs that went
into effect during 2003 would result in a sharp drop in payments to individuals in July. 
7. New home sales are recorded when a contr act is signed, which generally occurs before
the sale is closed.  In contrast, most sale s of existing homes are recorded at closing. an annual rate of just under 2-1/2 percent in the first half of the year,
1/2 percentage point below its earlier estimates.  In July, real DPI inched up just0.1 percent as increases in compensation were largely offset by declines inproprietors’ income and transfer payments.
6  As a result of the revisions to
income, the personal saving rate was marked down over the first half of theyear, and it fell to 0.6 percent in July.  Household net worth has been risingabout in line with income so far this year, although the lagged effects of thesubstantial increase in wealth in 2003 should be providing support to consumerspending.  Consumer sentiment has exhibited relatively small movements inrecent months after having moved up in the first half of the year.
Housing Markets
Housing activity rebounded in July after a dip in June.  Starts of new single-
family homes bounced back to an annual rate of 1.65 million units, the same asin May.  Permit issuance—adjusted for activity in areas where permits are notrequired—stayed at a high level in July, and the backlog of permits increased;these data suggest that single-family starts were probably strong in August. Indicators of activity in the multifamily sector followed much the same contour,with starts recovering in July from a June stumble and with the permit backlogrising.  
Home sales remained robust in July, although sales of both existing and new
homes were below the monthly peaks of earlier this year.  Sales of existinghomes in July were about 3-1/2 percent above the average pace during the firsthalf of the year.  Sales of new homes, which tend to lead sales of existing homesby a month or two, set a record in May but then fell sharply in the following twomonths.
7  Although sales of new homes in July were below their average in the
first half of the year, they were about 3-1/2 percent above the pace for 2003 as awhole.  
Recent indicators suggest that housing demand will stay relatively brisk in the
near term.  Rates on thirty-year conventional mortgages, which had risen above6 percent in the spring, have receded over the past couple of months and nowstand at 5.83 percent, around the middle of the low range that has prevailedsince early 2003.  In addition, the four-week moving average of mortgageapplications to purchase homes moved up sharply in early September.  Andalthough consumers’ home-buying attitudes have deteriorated a bit of late, theyare still in the favorable range that has persisted for the past couple of years.

8. The repeat-transactions price index, which is sometimes referred to as a "repeat sales"
price index, is based on repeated observations of  the value of a home, either through sales prices
or appraisals.Home prices have continued to rise rapidly.  In July, the average prices of both
new and existing homes sold were about 10 percent higher than a year earlier. Measures that are less affected by changes in the composition of homes soldhave also registered large increases.  For example, in the second quarter, therepeat-transactions price index for existing homes was 10 percent higher than ayear earlier, and the constant-quality price index for new homes was
8-1/4 percent higher.
8  As has been true for some time, the largest increases in
home prices over the past year generally have been in cities near the  East and
West coasts.
Equipment and Software
Real business outlays for equipment and software increased at an annual rate of
13-1/2 percent in the second quarter, and the data in hand point to anothersizable advance in the current quarter.  Although high-tech spending seems tohave decelerated, outlays for transportation equipment are rising briskly, andspending on other capital goods is on track for a significant increase this quarter. In general, investment in equipment and software has been supported by thecontinued gains in business output, low financing costs, ongoing price declinesfor high-tech capital, and the corporate sector’s large cushion of liquid assets. 
In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of both computing and
communications equipment rose in July, but the increases reversed only part ofthe declines in these series over the preceding two months.  Orders for high-techequipment have also been on the soft side in recent months; several bellwethercompanies—including Intel, Cisco, and Hewlett-Packard—have become lessoptimistic about their near-term sales prospects.  In contrast, orders andshipments of capital goods outside of high-tech moved up substantially in Juneand July, particularly in the machinery sector.  Orders have exceeded shipmentsin this broad category for six consecutive months, and the resulting upwardtrend in unfilled orders shows no signs of abating.
As noted, a sizable ramp-up in outlays for medium and heavy trucks appears to
be under way this quarter, partly in response to high levels of freight demandand a faster pace of replacement of aging fleets.  Business spending on aircraft,while still far below its peak of a few years ago, rose in the second quarter, andJuly data on shipments by domestic producers of aircraft suggest that the aircraftcomponent of equipment and software investment is holding up in the currentquarter.

Nonresidential Construction
In broad terms, real business investment in nonresidential structures has
remained around the depressed levels that have prevailed since the steep declinein 2001 and 2002.  However, the most recent data may be hinting that someimprovement is starting to take hold.  Real nonresidential construction spendingrose at an annual rate of 7 percent in the second quarter and apparently increasedfurther in July.
Indicators of market conditions for nonresidential structures continued to be
mixed in the second quarter.  In the office sector, the vacancy rate was only alittle below its recent peak, and rents continued to decline, although propertyvalues have inched up recently.  The vacancy rate for industrial space also remained near its high.  Conditions were brighter in the retail sector:  Thevacancy rate stayed low, and rents and property values both rose further.  Spending on drilling and mining structures likely has continued to increase at arobust pace in the current quarter, mainly because of the continued uptrend inthe number of natural gas drilling rigs in operation.
Business Inventories
We now estimate that real nonfarm NIPA inventories excluding motor vehicles
increased at an annual rate of $48 billion in the second quarter, and the data forJuly suggest that inventory rebuilding is continuing apace in the current quarter. Led by accumulations at aircraft manufact urers and at producers of petroleum
and coal products, the book value of manufacturing inventories rose at an annualrate of $45 billion in July; given the rise in oil prices, the nominal figures for thelatter category likely overstate real inventory investment.  The book value ofwholesale and retail trade inventories excluding motor vehicles increased at anannual rate of $41 billion in July, although these gains were also likely inflatedby price movements in the petroleum sector.
Some of the stockbuilding in recent months may have been the unintended
consequence of slower-than-expected sales.  Nevertheless, the recentaccumulation may not have been entirely unwelcome.  In particular,manufacturers likely built stocks, especially at earlier stages of processing, tokeep up with the ongoing rise in factory production.  And although the ISM’sindex of customer inventories rose dramatically in August, the percentage ofpurchasing managers who reported that their customers’ inventories were toolow continued to exceed the percentage that characterized them as too high. 
According to the staff’s flow-of-goods system, days’ supply of inventories
edged down in July.  Among industry groups, the inventories of motor vehiclesand paper remain elevated.  Inventories of communications equipment alsoremained high, although days’ supply has fallen nearly 20 percent since early2002.

Federal Government Sector
The federal budget picture continues to show modest improvement.  Adjusted
for payment-timing shifts, the federal budget recorded a deficit of $111 billionin July and August combined, $11 billion lower than for the same period lastyear.  Receipts were about 14 percent above their year-earlier level.  While mostof the increase relative to a year ago can be traced to the drain on revenue lastJuly and August from the mail-out of individual-income-tax rebate checks, othertax receipts did increase robustly over the past year.  Withheld and FICA taxes,which were unaffected by the rebate checks, were 6 percent higher in July andAugust than in the same period last year.
Outlays in July and August, adjusted for payment-timing shifts, were
7-1/2 percent over year-earlier levels.  Defense spending once again posted largeincreases—averaging 14 percent over the year-earlier level—after a brief lull inJune.  Outlays for net interest and Medicare also rose sharply.  Nevertheless,Medicaid spending in July and August fell below year-earlier levels with theexpiration on June 30 of the temporary increase in the federal matching rate.  
According to the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) midyear update of the
budget outlook, the federal budget will post a deficit of $422 billion in fiscalyear 2004, about $56 billion lower than projected last January.  Nevertheless,the CBO’s longer-term baseline deficit outlook has deteriorated a bit, with thecumulative deficit from 2005 to 2014 now projected to equal 1.5 percent ofnominal GDP, compared with 1.3 percent of GDP in last January’s projection. However, much of the deterioration in the outlook since January is the result ofthe rules governing the way in which the CBO puts together its baselineprojections; under these rules, the CBO is required to assume that the budgetauthority for discretionary spending will increase with inflation throughout theforecast period.  Thus, the recently passed Department of DefenseAppropriations Act, which provided an additional $28 billion for spending inIraq in 2004, boosted the CBO’s projection of defense spending through 2014. 
State and Local Government Sector
Indicators of spending by state and local governments have been positive in
recent months.  Employment was up 18,000 in August, about the same as inJuly.  Nominal construction spending edged up in July after having risen at a5 percent quarterly rate in the second quarter, the largest quarterly advance sincethe second quarter of 2001.  All major categories of state and local constructionspending have posted solid gains in recent months.
The improvement in aggregate spending by the sector is consistent with reports
of strengthening fiscal positions among the states.  Revenue collections in thefinal months of the last fiscal year (which ended on June 30 in all but a fewstates) came in strong.  As a result, many states ended fiscal 2004 with higher-than-expected balances and were able to begin rebuilding rainy-day funds.  All

states except Kentucky have enacted fi scal 2005 budgets.  State officials appear
to be generally upbeat about the prospects for the current year, although somehave expressed concern about budgets in 2006 and beyond in light of anticipatedincreases in Medicaid caseloads, school enrollments, and prison populations. 
Many cities are still dealing with serious fiscal problems.  According to a survey
soon to be released by the National League of Cities, the percentage of citiesreporting deteriorating fiscal conditions remained high in fiscal 2004, andofficials in more than half of the reporting cities think that their fiscal situationswill remain strained in 2005.  Although these governments are benefiting fromthe boom in real estate values, they remain under pressure from rapidly risinghealth-care and pension costs, increased spending on public safety, and markeddeclines in state aid.  In fiscal 2004, many cities raised or instituted new feesand charges and cut spending on services. 
Prices and Labor Costs
The overall CPI edged down 0.1 percent in July as energy prices fell and the
core component rose just 0.1 percent for a second month.  Over the twelvemonths ending in July, the overall CPI rose 3 percent, nearly 1 percentage pointfaster than over the preceding year.  The acceleration in part reflected a sharperincrease in energy prices, but food prices also rose more rapidly, and the twelve-month change in the core CPI moved up from 1-1/2 percent in July 2003 to1-3/4 percent in July 2004.
Retail energy prices fell nearly 2 percent in July after large increases in a
number of earlier months; a drop of 4-1/4 percent in gasoline prices led thedecline.  As summer began, gasoline inventories were quite lean by historicalstandards, but during the summer, lower demand and increased imports pushedinventories above the levels usually seen at that time of year.  The resultingdownward pressure on margins led gasoline prices to fall even as crude oilprices moved higher.  Available survey evidence points to an additional smalldecline in the CPI for gasoline in August.  Retail prices apparently continued tofall through early September, though the declines lagged the drop in crude oilprices since mid-August and thus resulted in a small uptick in margins.  Withinventories of natural gas remaining high through August, the spot price fornatural gas at Henry Hub fell sharply last month.  This week, Hurricane Ivancaused a temporary shutdown of oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and spotnatural gas prices rose 13 percent on September 14.  However, the level of spotnatural gas prices remains below the August average.
Consumer food prices rose 0.3 percent in July after an increase of 0.2 percent in
June.  Prices for meats and poultry have moved up sharply for several months,although recent large declines in the spot prices for livestock and poultry shouldhelp to reverse some of these increases.  Retail dairy prices had also acceleratedin the spring, but suppliers subsequently boosted milk production and, as a

result, dairy prices declined 0.6 percent in July.  Food away from home—which
accounts for about 40 percent of the CPI for food—rose 0.4 percent in July aftersmaller increases in May and June.  Over the twelve months ending in July,consumer food prices rose 4 percent, compared with a year-earlier rate ofincrease of about 2 percent.  The main effect of the recent hurricanes on food-related products has been damage to the citrus crop in Florida, where groves oforanges used for juice apparently were hard hit; futures prices for frozenconcentrated orange juice are up more than 20 percent since just before the firststorm.
Excluding food and energy, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent in July after a similar
increase in June.  On a three-month-change basis, core CPI inflation stood at anannual rate of 1-1/2 percent in July, down from 3-1/4 percent over the threemonths ending in April.  Both goods and services contributed to thismoderation:  Core commodity prices declined at an annual rate of 1 percent overthe three months ending in July after increasing 1-1/2 percent over the precedingthree-month period, and core services prices rose 2-1/2 percent after climbing4 percent during the earlier period.  We had interpreted the sharp step-up in coreinflation earlier this year as partly reflecting the pass-through of higher energyand import costs into core consumer prices and partly as payback for 2003’sunusually modest price increases.  While, on our estimates, the contribution ofthese pass-through effects is only just starting to crest, the moderation ininflation evident in the recent data suggests that much of the payback from theunusually modest increases last year is complete.
Core PCE prices were flat in July.  These prices rose 1-1/2 percent over the
twelve months ending in July, an acceleration of 1/4 percentage point relative tothe preceding year.  Both the market-based and nonmarket components of thecore PCE price index rose 1-1/2 percent over the past twelve months; for themarket-based index, this increase represented a small pickup from a year ago,while core nonmarket price inflation was little changed.
The PPI for core finished goods edged down 0.1 percent in August after a
0.1 percent increase in July.  Over the year ending in August, the core PPIincreased 1-1/2 percent, about 1 percentage point faster than the year-earlierincrease, as both core consumer and capital goods prices accelerated.  At theearlier stages of processing, the prices for core intermediate materials—led bylarge increases for building materials, chemicals, and nitrogenates—rose1 percent in August.  Prices for core crude materials increased 4-1/2 percent lastmonth and are up more than 32 percent over the past year, in large part becauseof a surge in prices for iron and steel scrap (although spot prices for scrap haveeased a little in recent weeks).  Since the PPI’s reporting date, commodity priceshave moved up again, with the CRB spot industrials index (which excludesenergy items) rising more than 5 percent over the past five weeks.

Inflation expectations as measured by the Michigan survey edged lower in
August.  Median year-ahead expected inflation was 2.8 percent last month,down 0.2 percentage point from July and similar to its first-quarter readings. Median expected inflation over the next five to ten years ticked down0.1 percentage point, to 2.7 percent; this series has remained in a relativelynarrow range over the past several years.
On labor costs, the BLS reported that hourly compensation in the nonfarm
business sector rose at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent in the second quarter; thisrate was considerably higher than the downward-revised first-quarter pace butwas in line with the average rate of increase seen over the preceding fourquarters.  After factoring in the anticipated revision to productivity growth, weestimate that unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 1-1/4 percent in the secondquarter and almost reversed their first-quarter decline.  (The published datashowed an increase of 1-3/4 percent in unit labor costs in the second quarter.) Taking a longer perspective, unit labor costs have edged lower over the pastseveral years, and with prices in the nonfarm business sector increasing at a slow,but steady, rate, the markup of prices over unit labor costs has risen to a levelsignificantly above the long-term average.  The markup in the nonfinancialcorporate sector has not risen as rapidly and is currently only little above itshistorical mean.
Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose
0.3 percent in August, a pace in line with the average rate of increase over thepast several months but well above the very low readings over much of 2003.  Asa result, the twelve-month change in this series has moved back up since the startof the year and stood at 2-1/4 percent in August.
Recent indicators suggest that health insurance costs are continuing to rise
rapidly, although some slowing from the outsized increases of the past few yearsappears to be in train.  The Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Benefitsconducted annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Researchand Educational Trust (HRET) showed that health insurance premiumsincreased 11-1/4 percent, on average, between the spring of 2003 and the springof 2004 after having risen about 14 percent over the preceding year.  For 2005,premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program are expected torise a bit less than 8 percent, compared with an increase of 9-1/2 percent in2004.  Earlier this year, the California Public Employees Retirement Systemannounced that its premiums (for non-Medicare enrollees) would go up about10 percent, on average, in 2005 after having risen 16-1/2 percent in 2004.

FOMC
1. This review focuses on the period since the last FOMC meeting, as is standard practice
for the Greenbook.  Accordingly, the effects of the employment report for July, which was
released on the Friday between the August Greenbook publication date and the August FOMCmeeting, are omitted from the discussion that follows.  Nonetheless, we would note that, on therelease of the report, the market’s expected path for the federal funds rate  flattened substantially,
and intermediate- and longer-term yields fell as much  as 1/4 percentage point.  In addition, broad
stock price indexes fell about 3 percent between the Greenbook publication date and the FOMC
meeting.    Domestic Financial Developments
Overview1
Near-term policy expectations firmed over the intermeeting period, as investors
apparently placed greater weight on the relatively optimistic August FOMCannouncement, comments by Federal Reserve officials expressing confidence inthe economic outlook, and the reassuring August employment report than onother economic data that came in on the soft side of expectations.  Federal fundsfutures rates now suggest that market participants are nearly certain of a 25 basispoint tightening at the September FOMC meeting.  At the same time, theanticipated path of policy further ahead edged lower as investors apparentlymarked down their outlook for inflation.  Longer-term Treasury yields dropped with the lower path for policy expectations beyond the middle of next year. Corporate risk spreads narrowed over the intermeeting period, and broad equityprice indexes posted solid gains.
Corporate borrowing has strengthened somewhat in recent months from its
fairly sluggish first-half pace.  Household debt growth stayed robust in thesecond quarter, although it was a bit below the first quarter’s double-digit pace,and low mortgage rates suggest that household borrowing has remained strongin the current quarter.  Growth in M2 has ebbed in recent months, a decreasereflecting in part the typical widening of opportunity cost that accompaniesrising short-term market rates.
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates
The FOMC’s decision at the August meeting to increase the funds rate target by
25 basis points, maintain a balanced assessment of risk, and retain the "measured
pace" language was widely anticipated, but investors reportedly viewed the tone
of the accompanying statement as optimistic and marked up their expectations
for the path of policy.  The employment report released earlier this month and aseries of comments from Federal Reserve officials expressing confidence about 
the economic expansion helped to solidify the view that the economy was likely 
emerging from a “soft patch,” even though the economic data releases over the intermeeting period were seen as mixed.  At the same time, subdued readings on 
core price inflation and comments by the Chairman suggesting that inflation 
pressures were well contained appeared to ease concerns about the inflation outlook.  The estimated path for the funds rate implied by futures contracts
III-2
III-3
moved up slightly through the first quarter of next year but shifted down
somewhat at longer horizons:  Investors now expect the funds rate to reachalmost 2 percent by the end of this year and about 2-3/4 percent by the end of2005.  All of the respondents to the New York Fed’s Primary Dealer Surveyanticipate a 25 basis point hike accompanied by a statement of balanced risks togrowth and inflation at the upcoming FOMC meeting.
The Treasury yield curve flattened in line with the shallower slope of the funds
rate path and, given the decline in implied volatilities on bond futures, perhapslower term premiums.  The two-year Treasury yield edged up 2 basis points andthe ten-year yield fell 14 basis points.  TIPS yields were unchanged at the short
end and declined less than nominal yields further out, reducing inflationcompensation 12 basis points over the next five years and 6 basis points over thesubsequent five years. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell a touch more than those on
comparable-maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting period.  Yieldson speculative-grade bonds fell about 30 basis points, narrowing risk spreadssomewhat.  Conditions in commercial paper markets remained accommodative.
Stock Prices, Earnings, and Credit Quality
Broad stock price indexes were up about 6 percent, on net, over the intermeeting
period, in part because of a pullback of oil prices from their recent peaks,leaving stock prices still shy of  recent highs in late June.  The rise in stockprices brought the twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firmsdown a touch, and its spread over a real long-run Treasury yield, a roughmeasure of the equity premium, narrowed a bit.  Implied volatility on both theNasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indexes touched eight-year lows.
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms rose 25 percent over the four
quarters ended in the second quarter.  Analysts’ forecasts in August of year-ahead corporate earnings were little changed from their July levels, whichmarked the end of an unusually long run of sizable upward revisions.  Augustyear-ahead forecasts imply a considerable slowdown in earnings growth overthe next few quarters, albeit to a pace that is still relatively strong.
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve.  The ratio of
interest expense to cash flow declined further in the second quarter, dropping toits lowest level in more than two decades.  Net upgrades of corporate bondsturned positive in the second quarter, the first positive quarterly reading since1998, and in July, upgrades outpaced downgrades by an even wider margin. Delinquencies on C&I loans continued to decline in the second quarter, and thesix-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds held steady in August at a
III-4
III-5
III-6
III-7
very low level.  The forecast of aggregate year-ahead default rates based on the
KMV model also stayed relatively low in July. 
Business Finance
On net, debt growth of nonfinancial firms in recent months has been above the
pace of the first half of the year.  Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firmsjumped in early August as bond yields dropped substantially.  A few firmsissued bonds to pay down commercial paper, prompting a small decline incommercial paper in August; most of the decline was reversed early this month. C&I loans expanded briskly in July and August after a moderate gain in thesecond quarter—the first quarterly increase in more than three years.  Responsesto the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in August indicated that,adjusted for loan characteristics, the average spread of C&I loan rates wasessentially unchanged from the narrow reading in the May survey.
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms has been sluggish in recent
months.  Seasoned equity offerings in August were at the lower end of theirrecent range, and initial public offerings were minimal apart from Google’shighly anticipated debut.  In contrast to the slow pace of gross public issuance,second-quarter equity retirements picked up on the strength of continued robustcorporate profits and ample cash on firms’ balance sheets.  Both cash-financedmergers and share repurchases increased in the second quarter and will likely beeven stronger in the third quarter given the recent pace of announcements.  As aresult, net equity issuance is estimated to have dropped in the second quarter andis likely to come in even more negative in the current quarter. 
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial mortgage debt expanded at a rapid annual rate of 11-1/2 percent in
the second quarter, and the available information points to continued strength inthe third quarter.  Meanwhile, credit quality remained favorable, with thedelinquency rate on commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)maintaining its downward trend in July and the delinquency rates on commercialmortgages held by banks and insurance companies remaining at low levels inthe second quarter.  CMBS spreads have stayed low, and REIT equity priceshave now fully reversed their spring decline.
Household Finance
Interest rates on adjustable-rate and thirty-year fixed-rate home mortgages fell
slightly over the intermeeting period.  With rates at attractive levels andmortgage applications well maintained, it appears likely that mortgage debtgrowth will remain robust through the current quarter.  While still relativelyhigh, the spread between rates on fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages hasdeclined about 10 basis points since the last FOMC and more than 60 basis

III-11
points since its recent high in May.  Accordingly, the ARM share of originations
has likely continued to decline after its tick down in July.
The ratio of households’ financial obligations to their disposable income edged
down further in the second quarter.  This ratio had declined 2/3 percentage pointsince the end of 2002, in part because of slow growth in rent payments relativeto income.  The relative slowing of rent payments suggests some easing offinancial pressure for renters, who tend to have more burdensome financialobligations than other households.  Indeed, the estimated financial obligationsratio for renters declined by 2 percentage points since the end of 2002.   
Measures of household credit quality held steady over the intermeeting period. 
Delinquency rates on auto loans at captive finance companies remained low inJuly, while those on consumer loans and residential mortgages at commercialbanks were little changed during the second quarter.  Estimated year-to-datehousehold bankruptcy filings were nearly 5 percent lower than they were overthe same period last year, but they remained somewhat elevated compared withthe pace in previous years.
Modest gains in stock prices, brisk house-price appreciation, and moderate
income growth resulted in an essentially unchanged ratio of household net worthto disposable income over the second quarter.  The only available indicator ofhousehold net worth for the third quarter is stock prices, which are at about thesame level as they were at the end of the second quarter.
Aggregate estimated inflows to capital market mutual funds were tepid in
August and slightly off July’s pace.  Sharp increases in flows to bond funds inAugust were balanced by declines in flows to equity funds.
State and Local Government Finance
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was moderate in July and August,
holding at a level considerably below the elevated pace seen over the precedingfew years.  Short-term debt issuance rose in August, but the bulk of the increasecame from a single $6.6 billion issue by the state of Texas, which typicallyissues short-term bonds in late summer to cover funding needs at the start of itsfiscal year until tax revenues arrive in January.  Aside from this deal, the level ofshort-term issuance remained low, reflecting the improved budget situations inmany states.  
Municipal bond credit quality continued to strengthen.  Upgrades of municipal
bonds again outpaced downgrades in August and early September, as they havesince February.  In particular, S&P upgraded California’s general obligation

III-13
2. In July, the composition of bank credit was affected by a $30 billion reclassification; two
institutions reclassified the seller’s interest portion of securitized credit card loans from other
securities to consumer loans.bonds from BBB to A.  Risk spreads of BBB-rated municipal bond yields over
AAA yields were little changed and remained near multiyear lows.
Treasury and GSE Finance
After a somewhat larger-than-anticipated monthly federal budget surplus in
June, the deficits for July and August were close to market expectations.  TheTreasury’s midquarter refunding was reportedly well received by investors, andthe continuing solid level of indirect bidding indicated that foreign demand for
Treasury securities remained strong.
The level of federal debt again has begun to approach its statutory limit, and
current staff estimates suggest that the ceiling will be reached by the middle ofOctober.  If, as expected, the Congress fails to raise the debt limit by then, theTreasury will likely be forced to employ accounting maneuvers similar to thoseused in past years to keep debt under the limit for a few weeks.
Despite uncertainty about the outcomes of ongoing investigations into their
accounting practices, the spreads of yields of Fannie Mae and Freddie Macbonds over comparable Treasury securities were little changed over theintermeeting period.  Their stock prices rose slightly more than those ofcommercial banks. 
Money and Bank Credit
Growth in M2 was essentially flat over July and August, a sharp deceleration
from the rapid growth in the second quarter.  This slowing apparently resultedfrom increases in the opportunity cost of M2 with the move to tighter monetarypolicy and the lingering effects of the late-spring dropoff in mortgagerefinancing.  In particular, retail money funds and liquid deposits, whose rates ofreturn are slow to adjust to increases in market rates, posted minimal growth oroutright declines.  In contrast, small time deposits, whose rates of return adjustmore promptly, posted positive growth in July for the first time in more than twoyears and strengthened further in August.
After stalling in July, bank credit increased at an annual rate of almost 4 percent
in August as a contraction in banks’ securities holdings was more than offset bymoderate loan growth.
2  C&I loans originated by banks grew for the third
consecutive month.  Real estate loan growth slowed from its second-quarterpace, partly reflecting securitizations.  Consumer loans adjusted forsecuritizations edged down.

U.S. International Transactions
Trade in Goods and Services
Since the August Greenbook, trade data were released for June and July.  In
June, the U.S. international trade deficit reached a record high of $55.0 billion,(revised down from a preliminary estimate of $55.8 billion).  The trade deficitshrank to $50.1 billion in July, but was still much larger than May’s deficit.  
In June, the value of exports of goods and services decreased 3.9 percent, with
exports of goods accounting for the entire fall, as exports of services edged up. The decrease in the value of exported goods was widespread.  The largestdeclines occurred in capital goods, industrial supplies, and agricultural products. Within capital goods, aircraft and “other” capital goods showed the steepestdeclines, though computers and semiconductors also fell.  Overall, for thesecond quarter, the value of exported goods and services was about 12½ percentat an annual rate above its first quarter level.  The quarterly increase wasconcentrated in services, industrial supplies, and capital goods.  Exports ofautomotive products and consumer goods also rose, but exports of agriculturalproducts fell. 
After the sharp fall in June, the value of exports of goods and services partially
recovered in July, increasing 3.0 percent.  Exports of goods more than accountedfor the entire rise, as exports of services edged down slightly.  The increase inthe value of exported goods was driven by increases in capital goods(particularly aircraft), industrial supplies, and automotive products.  Exports ofagricultural products also increased.  However, the category of automotiveproducts was the only one for which July’s recovery was sufficient to result inexports being greater than May’s value.  For the fourth consecutive month,exports of consumer goods declined.

IV-3

The value of imports of goods and services rose 2.9 percent in June, as imports
of goods surged and imports of services rose modestly.  Within goods, thelargest increases were in imports of petroleum (mostly from higher quantity, butalso from higher prices), capital goods, and non-oil industrial supplies.  Importsof consumer goods and of foods, feeds and beverages edged down.  Imports ofautomotive products (particularly from non-NAFTA partners) fell more sharply. At an annual rate, the value of imported goods and services in the second quarterwas nearly 21 percent above its first quarter level.  The quarterly rise was drivenlargely by increases in imports of non-oil industrial supplies, capital goods, andconsumer goods. 
Following the sizable increase in June, the value of imports of goods and
services fell 1.4 percent in July, with declines in both imports of goods andservices.  Within the major categories of goods, only imports of automotiveproducts increased in July.  Imports of foods and consumer goods had thesharpest percentage declines.  Imports of capital goods and industrial suppliesalso edged downward.  In July, the value of oil imports fell as a sharp decline involume was reinforced with a small decline in price.
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods
Since the August Greenbook, price data for traded goods were released for July
and August. 
Non-oil imports.  
In July, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods were unchanged, but pricesof core goods increased 0.1 percent.  Prices of imported core goods rose slightlyfaster than in June, but still below the rates of increase seen earlier in the year.  The largest contribution to core import prices came from prices of importedcapital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors), which, after havingbeen about flat throughout most of this year, rose 0.4 percent in July (mostlyfrom higher prices for imported industrial and service machinery).  Prices ofimported foods also increased 0.4 percent in July.  Import prices for consumergoods and automotive products saw little change in July.  Prices of importedcomputers and semiconductors continued to decline in July.  
In August, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods
increased 0.4 and 0.5 percent, respectively.  Prices of imported core goodspicked up noticeably from July and rose at the fastest monthly rate since April.After increasing only 0.2 percent in July, prices of imported non-oil industrialsupplies contributed the most to the acceleration, rising 2.0 percent in August,largely reflecting a surge in lumber prices.  Import prices of capital goods(excluding computer and semiconductors) rose 0.2 percent in August, thesecond consecutive month of price increases.  Prices of imported foods, 
IV-5
IV-6
following a strong July, edged up just 0.1 percent in August.  Import prices of
computers continued to decline in August, whereas prices of importedsemiconductors edged up 0.1 percent.  Import prices for consumer goods andautomotive products were unchanged in August.  
Overall, the average level of imported core goods prices in July and August was
2¼ percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter level.  This rate ofincrease is much smaller than the increases in the first and second quarters.  InJuly and August, the rise was concentrated in non-oil industrial supplies and, toa lesser extent, capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors), andfoods. 
Oil.  After increasing 2 percent in July, the BLS price of imported oil rose
nearly 10 percent in August, in line with the average monthly increase in thespot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil.  The spot price of WTIsurged to a record high of $48.70 per barrel in mid-August amid concerns aboutthe availability of supply to meet surprisingly strong demand.  Since then, thespot price of WTI has dropped back to about $44 per barrel, but remainsvolatile.  Factors influencing oil prices include ongoing violence in Iraq,uncertainty about future oil production and exports by Yukos in Russia, recentdeclines in U.S. crude oil inventories, and storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Exports.   
In July, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods rose 0.5 and0.6 percent, respectively.  Rising 1.9 percent in July, prices for exported non-agricultural industrial supplies (particularly steel and iron products) contributedto most of the increase.  Export prices of consumer goods also contributed,rising 0.5 percent.  These increases more than offset a 1.0 percent drop in theprice of agricultural exports, the second consecutive month of price declines. Prices of exported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors)ticked up 0.1 percent.  Export prices of computers fell 0.5 percent, whereasexport prices of semiconductors increase 0.1 percent. 
In August, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods retraced
their increases in July, falling 0.5 and 0.6 percent, respectively.  The fall inexport prices is entirely attributable to a fall in the prices of U.S. agriculturalexports, particularly soybeans and corn.  Following strong increases in July,prices of exported non-agricultural industrial supplies rose 0.8 percent inAugust.  Export prices of consumer goods and capital goods (excludingcomputers and semiconductors) each rose 0.2 percent.  In August, prices ofexported automotive products ticked up 0.1 percent.  Export prices of computersfell 0.1 percent, whereas export prices of semiconductors were unchanged.

netThe average level of exported core goods prices in July and August was about
unchanged from the second-quarter level, which is a considerable step-downfrom the price increases that occurred earlier this year.  A decline in prices ofexported agricultural products offset moderate increases in industrial suppliesand small increases in other categories.
Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $665 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter
of 2004, up from $589 billion in the first quarter of 2004 (revised).  The changewas driven by a widening of the trade deficit on goods and services and a fall inthe surplus on investment income. 
The deficit on goods and services widened $47 billion in the second quarter, as
an $80 billion increase in imports was only partially offset by a $33 billionincrease in exports.  The increase in the value of imported goods largelyreflected strong increases in industrial supplies, capital goods, and consumergoods.  Imports of services rose $4 billion.  The value of exported goodsincreased $22 billion, with much of the increase concentrated in industrialsupplies, capital goods and consumer goods.  Exports of services moved up$11 billion. 
The surplus on net investment income fell $38 billion in the second quarter, as a
$13 billion rise in receipts was swamped by a $52 billion rise in payments.  Thesizable increase in payments reflects a $27 billion increase in direct investmentpayments and a $24 billion increase in portfolio payments.  The rise in receipts
IV-8
was a result of a $10 billion increase in portfolio income and a $4 billion
increase in direct investment receipts. 
Net unilateral transfers to foreigners fell $9 billion as a result of a $11 billion
decline in U.S. government grants being only partially offset by a $2 billionincrease in private remittances.  The decline in government grants follows a$12 billion increase in U.S. government grants in the first quarter. 
U.S. International Financial Transactions
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S.
International Transactions table) remained very strong in July.  Inflows weredriven by foreign purchases of corporate bonds (line 4c), which continued at anelevated pace, and Treasury securities (line 4a), which remained robust.  Privatepurchases of agency bonds (line 4b) and equities (line 4d) moved up from theirmodest levels of recent quarters.  Euro-area countries increased their holdings ofU.S. securities in July, while private inflows from Japan, which picked upsubstantially in the second quarter, remained elevated.
Net foreign official inflows (line 1) slowed to $13 billion in July, following
monthly averages of roughly $25 billion in the second quarter and $43 billion inthe first quarter.      .  Totalholdings at the FRBNY increased for August, and averaging this increase withthe inflows recorded for July yields a significant inflow, similar to the rate of thesecond quarter. 
U.S. acquisition of foreign securities picked up a bit in July (line 5).  The
increase was primarily driven by U.S. investors’ demand for equities (line 5b),but U.S. investors bought foreign bonds (line 5a) for the second consecutivemonth as well.  
The banking sector (line 3), which is volatile, recorded modest outflows in July.The recently released balance of payments data for the second quarter show that
U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) moved up to nearly $61 billion whileforeign direct investment in the United States (line 7) jumped up to $32 billion. The disparity between these flows is mainly attributable to differing levels ofreinvested earnings in the U.S. and abroad rather than difference in new cross-border acquisitions.  
The statistical discrepancy was positive for the second consecutive quarter,
indicating some combination of overreporting of the current account deficit orunderreporting of net capital inflows.

Foreign Financial Markets
The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value changed little, on net, over the
intermeeting period.  The dollar depreciated in mid-August following the releaseof data showing a much larger than expected trade deficit for June, but laterretraced much of that decline.  Although the price of the NYMEX front-monthcrude oil futures contract fluctuated widely over the period, reaching an intradaypeak near $50 per barrel on August 20, oil prices did not appear to besystematically associated with exchange rate movements.  
On a bilateral basis, the dollar appreciated more than 3 percent on balance
versus sterling, as the Bank of England held its policy stance unchanged andmarket participants scaled back expectations for future tightening.  The dollardepreciated about ¾ percent against the Canadian dollar.  The Bank of Canadaraised its main policy rate 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent, on September 8,citing concerns about inflation arising in part from oil prices.  The dollarappreciated 1 percent against the euro and Swiss franc, and depreciated about¾ percent vis-a-vis the yen.  
Movements in short-term spot interest rates in foreign industrial countries were,
with the exception of Canada, generally modest over the period.  Marketmeasures of expected future short-term interest rates declined moderately forsterling, in part on reports showing a slowdown in the rate of increase of 
IV-11
housing prices.  Implied rates rose slightly for the euro; several ECB Governing
Council members expressed concerns about the potential impact of rising oilprices on inflation.  However, in the absence of salient economic news, ten-yearbenchmark yields for the United Kingdom and the euro area were little changedon net.  In Japan, benchmark yields and money market futures rates for 2005 and2006 declined on new concerns about the strength of the current economicrecovery, as GDP and machinery orders data came in well below marketexpectations.  Japan’s benchmark equity index nevertheless rose about 2percent.  Equity prices rose about 5 percent in the euro area and the UnitedKingdom.
Asset prices rose substantially over the period in a number of emerging-market
countries.  The Brazilian real appreciated 4 percent against the dollar and
Brazil’s EMBI+ spread over Treasuries fell about 90 basis points.  These pricemovements appeared to be driven in part by renewed optimism about thegovernment’s ability to implement fiscal reforms following a favorable decisionby Brazil’s supreme court regarding the government’s authority to tax pensionsof public sector employees.  The Mexican peso depreciated about 1¼ percent onbalance versus the dollar, but equity prices in Mexico rose almost 8 percent. 
IV-12
There was little market reaction to news in mid-August that a referendum to
recall Venezuela’s President Chavez had failed by a wide margin.  In emerging Asia, equity prices, led by the technology sector, rose sharply in a number ofcountries, more than reversing the declines registered in the previous intermeeting period.  Prices appeared to be also supported by abating concernsabout the likelihood of a hard landing for China’s economy and by themoderation in crude oil prices in late August.  Stock prices rose about 9 percenton net in Taiwan and close to 14 percent in Korea.  Korean financial assets werealso supported by an unexpected 25-basis-point cut in the Bank of Korea’spolicy rate on August 12.  In Russia, equity prices were up about 12 percent andthe sovereign yield spread over Treasuries declined slightly, despite a series ofterrorist attacks and continued uncertainty over the future of Yukos, Russia’s topoil producer.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries
Economic activity in the major foreign industrial economies continued to
expand in the second quarter, though growth slowed in Japan and the euro area. Indicators for the third quarter have been mixed.  In Japan, growth stepped downappreciably in the second quarter, and recent readings on activity have been soft. Growth in the euro area slowed a bit in the second quarter, with domesticdemand remaining sluggish, and indicators for July and August suggest acontinued lackluster recovery.  Real GDP accelerated in Canada, largelyreflecting a boom in exports.  In the United Kingdom, domestic demandcontinued to expand briskly.
Driven by the sharp rise in energy costs, headline rates of consumer price
inflation have moved up sharply since the first quarter, before weakening a bitrecently.  In Canada, headline inflation eased to 2.3 percent in July.  Inflation inthe euro area is edging down gradually but remains above the ECB’s 2 percentceiling.  In the United Kingdom, inflation inched down to 1.3 percent in August,well below the Bank of England’s 2 percent inflation target.  Slight deflationpersisted in Japan.
On September 8, the Bank of Canada raised its key policy interest rate 25 basis
points to 2.25 percent. 
In Japan , revised estimates show that real GDP rose 1.3 percent during the
second quarter.  Personal consumption advanced about 2½ percent, and businessfixed investment rose 5 percent.  However, growth was depressed by a steepdrop in government investment, which plunged 25 percent.  In addition, adeceleration in inventory accumulation subtracted 1 percentage point from
growth.  Exports surged 15 percent, outpacing an 8 percent increase in imports,and net exports added about 1 percentage point to growth.  Nominal GDPdeclined 2.1 percent, following four consecutive quarters of increases.  TheGDP deflator fell 2.7 percent below its year-ago level.
Indicators suggest an anemic start to the third quarter.  Industrial production was
flat in July, after falling sharply in June.  Data on consumer spending weremixed; household expenditures fell for a third straight month in July, thoughnew car registrations rebounded in July and August.  Real exports fell roughly1½ percent in July, and real imports were down about 3 percent.  Coremachinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, dropped
about 11 percent in July from the previous month.  
The unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent in July, with employment retracing
only some of the steep losses recorded in June.  Conversely, the

job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of employment, moved up to
0.83 in July, marking an eleven-year high.  Nominal wages continued to fallthrough July, depressed by cuts in summer bonuses.  Consumer price deflationremained mild.  Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which excludefresh food but include energy) were unchanged in August from the previousmonth and were down 0.2 percent from a year earlier.  Higher commodity priceshelped to push wholesale prices up 1.7 percent in August compared with thesame month a year ago, the largest twelve-month increase since 1991.
The government has begun the budget process for FY2005.  It aims to keep
overall spending fairly close to the FY2004 level.  Debt-servicing costs willlikely increase, but the government hopes to cut discretionary spending 2percent.  Spending on public works is slated for a reduction of about 3 percent.

Euro-area  real GDP rose 2.1 percent in the second quarter, slightly below the
first-quarter pace.  Growth in total domestic demand slowed to 0.6 percent.  Netexports accounted for most of the GDP growth, with a surge in exportsoutpacing a large increase in imports.  Growth among the major membercountries was varied.  German GDP accelerated slightly, but domestic demandmade a negative contribution to growth.  Growth in France remained robust, andwas almost entirely attributable to domestic demand.  Italian real GDP rose 1.1percent. 
Early indicators of activity for the third quarter have been generally positive. 
Euro-area retail sales rose 0.4 percent in July, with most member countriesshowing an increase.  After falling sharply in June, German orders ofmanufacturing goods increased 3 percent in July, returning to near their May

followed a similar pattern, increasing 1.6 percent in July.  
In contrast, third-quarter sentiment indicators have been somewhat
disappointing.  The German IFO business climate index resumed its downwardtrend in July.  The IFO index peaked in January and has fallen considerablysince.  The current conditions component of the survey has been more robustand has risen over the course of the year.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI fellto 53.9 in August, marking its lowest level since March.
Labor market conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the
unemployment rate unchanged at 9 percent in July.  The German unemploymentrate increased slightly to 10.6 percent in July and remained at that level inAugust.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area remained at 2.3 percent
in August, still above the ECB’s 2 percent target ceiling.  The pickup ininflation since the first quarter has been mainly the result of a surge in energyand administered prices.  The ECB is closely monitoring price developments forsecond-round effects of these increases.  In June, core inflation, excludingenergy and processed food, edged down to 2.1 percent.
Real GDP in the United Kingdom  expanded 3.8 percent in the second quarter,
led by substantial rises in consumption, investment, and government spending. These increases were partly offset by a small negative contribution frominventories.
Limited indicators point to somewhat slower growth in the third quarter.  The

edged down in July, though one of the leading surveys of retail sales suggeststhat sales moved up a touch in August.
According to the two main private surveys, the monthly increase in housing
prices dropped sharply, and perhaps even turned slightly negative in August. Household net mortgage and consumer borrowing slowed in July, though to astill rapid rate.
The labor market continued to be tight, as the official-claims-based measure of
the unemployment rate remained near its lowest points since 1975 and the labor-force-survey measure stayed close to its nadir.  The twelve-month rate ofconsumer price inflation edged down to 1.3 percent in August, well below theBank of England’s 2 percent target.

In Canada , real GDP accelerated to 4.3 percent in the second quarter, as a
broad-based surge in exports more than offset a slowing of final domesticdemand.  Exports of machinery, equipment, and forestry products wereespecially strong, and net exports contributed 3.4 percentage points to growth. Domestic demand was depressed by a deceleration in both residentialinvestment and personal consumption.
Indicators for the third quarter suggest some slowing in activity.  Average
housing starts in July and August were 1.1 percent below the second-quarteraverage, pulling back from a fourteen-year high.  Total employment wasroughly unchanged in August, and the unemployment rate held steady at 7.2percent.  The trade surplus narrowed in July as rising imports outpaced exports. The growth in the composite index of leading indicators moderated in July aftervery strong increases in the second quarter.  New manufacturing orderscontinued to move up in July.

In July, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation eased to 2.3 percent
from 2.5 percent in June.  The decrease reflected a moderation of the year-over-year rise in the price of gasoline, as twelve-month core inflation, excludingfood, energy, and indirect taxes, moved up to 1.5 percent.
On September 8, the Bank of Canada increased the targeted overnight rate (its
key policy rate) and the Bank Rate 25 basis points each, to 2.25 percent and 2.5percent, respectively.  The move was the Bank’s first since the end of an easingcycle in April.  The Bank stated that its decision was based onstronger-than-expected growth in the first half of the year, particularly in theexternal sector, that brought the economy close to full capacity.  The increasewas also characterized as needed to “avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures.” The statement added that headline inflation “has remained above expectations,primarily because oil prices have been persistently higher than the Bank hadassumed.”

Economic Situation in Other Countries
In emerging Asia, the pace of economic performance has varied markedly across
countries in recent months.  While Hong Kong enjoyed strong growth, Chinaregistered mixed indicators; activity in Taiwan and Korea slowed.  Economicperformance in Latin America remained robust, particularly in Mexico andBrazil.  Inflation in the developing world moved upward, mainly as a result ofincreases in energy and food prices, but the level of inflation remainedmoderate.
Recent indicators of Chinese economic performance have been mixed. 
Administrative and quantitative measures to control investment and banklending remain in place, and lending has contracted in the last two months. Money supply growth has also slowed and industrial production has cooled atad.  However, investment surged in July, after decelerating for several months,and import growth has slowed only modestly.  Exports continue to rise at abreakneck pace.  Inflation inched up further, with consumer prices rising5.3 percent in the twelve months ending in July.  However, excluding foodprices, consumer prices have been little changed over that period.

quarter, supported by strong exports and tourism.  Private consumption alsomoved up, in line with recent increases in consumer confidence.

Real GDP in Taiwan fell 4.5 percent in the second quarter, as consumption
spending contracted in the wake of the confusion surrounding the Marchpresidential election results.  While overall production fell in July, indicators ofhigh-tech production were down only sli ghtly, and new export orders for high-
tech goods reached record highs in June and July.  Twelve-month consumerprice inflation rose 2.5 percent in August on the back of increases in food andenergy prices.

For Korea , data since the last Greenbook have been relatively weak.  GDP
growth continued to decelerate in the second quarter, with output up just2.3 percent at an annual rate.  Industrial production for July was roughlyunchanged after a sizable drop in June, reflecting further poor performance inthe automobile and high-tech sectors.  Output in the services industries alsodeclined in July from a year earlier.  The unemployment rate ticked up in Julyand consumer price inflation climbed in July and August as a result of higherfood and oil prices.  The trade balance soared in July but indications are forsome moderation in August.  In response to the anemic economic performance,the Bank of Korea lowered its target interest rate 25 basis points to 3.50 percentin mid-August and the government recently announced a series of stimulusmeasures, including a 1 percent reduction in income taxes starting in 2005.

Incoming data from the ASEAN countries suggest that economic activity
continued to grow, but performance varied.  In Singapore, real GDP rose nearly12 percent in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digitgrowth, on the back of strong performance in electronics.  Industrial productionwas volatile, growing 3 percent in July after a 3½ percent decline in June. Second-quarter real GDP growth increased to 8 percent in Malaysia and to5½ percent in Indonesia, while growth was about 3 percent in the Philippinesand Thailand.  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore continued to record largetrade balances in the second quarter, while in Thailand the balance shifted todeficit.  Average monthly inflation over July-August moderated relative to thesecond quarter, apparently as the effects of earlier oil price and food priceincreases wane, although twelve-month inflation continued to rise.

In Mexico , GDP expanded at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the
third consecutive quarter of growth near or above 5 percent.  Other recentindicators of economic activity have been mixed.  Industrial production roseabout 1 percent in July after declining in May and June.  In contrast, Mexicanexports decreased in July for the second month in a row, with manufacturingexports particularly weak.  Imports of intermediate goods (which are mostly forassembly and re-export) also fell in July.  Imports of consumer and capitalgoods remained at high levels in July, consistent with continued strength indomestic demand; however, retail sales data showed a 1½ percent decline inJune.  Government spending also has supported domestic demand; high oilprices have boosted government revenues, and part of that has been allocated toincreased infrastructure spending and transfers to the states.
The Bank of Mexico tightened monetary policy on August 27.  The move came
after data from the first half of Augus t showed twelve-month inflation rising to
nearly 5 percent, well above the 2 to 4 percent target.  The Bank said that,although largely due to temporary factors, the rise in inflation "contributed tothe perception that it will be difficult to reach the target established for thisyear."  The Bank is apparently concerned about surveys showing that the rise ininflation has fed into an increase in inflation expectations.

In Brazil , real GDP rose 6 percent in the second quarter, supported by strength
in private consumption.  Data releases for the third quarter point to continuedexpansion; July industrial production was up 0.5 percent and August vehiclesales reached record highs for the month.  Brazil also continued to record sizabletrade surpluses, reflecting strong export growth.  Monthly consumer priceinflation has been rising since the first quarter and reached 0.9 percent in July,driven in part by increases in domestic prices of energy and government-regulated prices.  Twelve-month inflation reached 7.2 percent in August, wellabove the 5½ percent midpoint inflation target for end-2004.  
The Brazilian central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 16 percent
in its late August meeting; the rate has been at this level since April.  Robustgrowth has quelled concerns that monetary policy has been too tight.  Brazil’sEMBI+ spreads decreased about 90 basis points, apparently driven in part byrenewed optimism about the government’s ability to implement fiscal reformfollowing a mid-August decision by the supreme court that allows thegovernment to tax the pensions of retired civil servants.

In Argentina , recent data releases continue to point to a moderation in the pace
of economic recovery.  Industrial production fell slightly in July, following asoft performance in previous months.  The energy shortages earlier in the yearappear to have had a moderate impact on economic activity.  Twelve-monthconsumer price inflation increased in recent months, and now stands at about 5percent.  The country has continued to run sizable trade surpluses.
In mid-August, Argentina announced that the delayed third review of its
agreement with the IMF would be rescheduled to December or January, after thecountry restructures its debt with private creditors.  Argentine authorities arguedthat this postponement would ensure that talks between the IMF and Argentinawould not interfere with the accord that  the country aims to reach with its
private creditors.  The Argentine government stated that it would continuemaking its scheduled payments to the IMF of about $2 billion for the rest of thisyear.  The IMF will not make its scheduled disbursements, since they areconditional on the approval of program reviews.

In Venezuela , President Hugo Chavez survived the August 15 recall
referendum, winning 58 percent of the popular vote.  This result will enable himto complete his term, which expires at the end of 2006.  The vote culminatednearly a year of efforts by the opposition to remove Chavez by peaceful meansafter a failed coup attempt and national strikes in 2002.  Chavez’s victory seemsto have quelled concerns about political instability.  Oil production is still about15 percent below the level prevailing before the national strike in late 2002,when Chavez fired much of the national oil company’s skilled personnel.

Recent data from Russia suggest waning growth in the third quarter.  Industrial
production declined 0.3 percent in July, due in part to the inability of some firmsto access credit during this summer’s bank runs, and early indicators suggestthat August production was also weak.  Twelve-month inflation increased tomore than 11 percent in August, raising concerns that Russia will fail to meet itsyear-end 10 percent inflation target.
In the oil sector, the Kremlin-Yukos standoff continued.  In August, the Justice
Ministry contracted with a private firm to assess the value of Yukos’ main oilproduction facility, increasing the possibility  of a transparent auction of Yukos’
assets.  Russian courts froze more of Yukos’ accounts in early September,prompting the company to warn that it may be forced to cease operations. Despite this warning, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia would increaseits oil output this year.
