Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Overview 
Overall economic activity continues to incr ease at a moderate pace despite headwinds 
caused in large part by the sharp rise in oil prices.  Consumer and business fixed 
investment spending posted solid gains in the third quarter.  Furtherm ore, activity in the 
housing sector remains strong.  Aside fr om the hurricane-related disruptions, 
manufacturing production continues to expand but  at a pace well below that registered in 
the first half of the year.  Likewise, the la bor market has seen four months of subpar 
hiring, after the surge in employment gain s this spring.  Consumer price inflation 
continues to be moderate despite surging oil prices. 
 
Labor Market Developments 
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 59,000  in September, the fourth consecutive 
month of sluggish job gains.  Over this period, private payrolls  increased only 77,000 per 
month on average, well below the 293,000 av erage increase posted from March through 
May.1  The workweek stood at 33.8 hours throughout  the third quarter; th is slight increase 
relative to the second-qu arter level contributed to a gain of 3.2 percent at an annual rate 
in aggregate hours of private production and nonsupervisory workers.  The four 
hurricanes that hit the southeas tern states had little net effect on the aggregate labor-
market data for August and September, accord ing to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate held at 5.4 percent in September, and the 
labor force participation rate edged down to 65.9 percent, about the same level as at the 
beginning of this year.  The employme nt-population ratio, which combines the 
unemployment rate and the par ticipation rate, fell for a second month in September and, 
at 62.3 percent, stands well below its year 2000  peak and a little be low its level in the 
mid-1990s.  In addition, the number of persons  working part-time for economic reasons 
as a share of total employment, although dow n from its recent peak, remained high in 
September.  On balance, we interpret thes e recent indicators from the household survey 
as suggesting that some measurable slack remains in the labor market. 
 Other labor market indicators have shown mi xed signals over the last few months.  The 
four-week moving average of initial clai ms for unemployment insurance was 343,000 in 
the week ending October 23.  Th e level of initial claims was elevated in October by the 
aftereffects of the hurricanes; abstracting fr om this distortion, initial claims have 
remained in a narrow range around 340,000 since the start of the year.  Households’ perceptions of the job market, as measured in the Conference Board Survey, dimmed in 
October.  Moreover, households’ expectations of labor market condi tions deteriorated a 
bit in October, according to the Conference Board Survey, and have been flat since August, according to the Michigan Survey.  
                                                
 
1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary estimate  of the benchmark revision to the level of payroll 
employment in March 2004 is an upward revision of 236,000, or 0.2 percent, a bit smaller than the average 
absolute revision seen over the past decade.

On a brighter note, fewer i ndividuals exhausted their unemp loyment insurance benefits 
without finding a job in Sept ember, and the number of exhaustees was well below its 
elevated levels of a year ago.  Layoff announ cements plunged in Oct ober to their lowest 
level since 2000.  In addition, the job openings series in th e JOLTS survey edged up over 
the summer, although it declined slightly in August.  Fina lly, the Manpower survey of 
firms’ hiring plans for the f ourth quarter remained at its recent high, and the more volatile 
NFIB survey edged up in October, retracing some of its September drop.   
 
Industrial Production 
Industrial production in Septembe r was restrained by the spate of hurricanes that occurred 
that month.  Total production was up just 0.1 pe rcent as a surge in out put at utilities was 
nearly offset by a drop in manufacturing out put.  The limited data we have in hand 
suggest that IP increased in October, and most near-term i ndicators suggest that activity 
in the manufacturing sector will expand at a moderate pace in coming months.    
 
Although the exact magnitude of the effect of the hurricanes is difficult to determine, we 
believe that the change in total IP in Sept ember was reduced roughly ½ percentage point.  
Sharp declines in oil and gas extraction, petroleum refi ning, and organic chemical 
production are directly attributab le to shutdowns in the aff ected areas.  Other industries 
for which a sizable share of shipments originates from hurricane-affected areas, such as textile products, also saw outsized production de clines.  Utilization rates for many of the 
affected industries––especially continuous processing industries such as petroleum 
refining––were high before the hurricanes hit, limiting their capability to make up 
production losses.
2  In addition, damages to infras tructure have further limited the 
recovery of energy produci ng industries in October.  
 Weekly data for October suggest that elec tricity generation move d up last month, likely 
in part because of a rebound in electricity sa les in areas that had hurricane-related power 
outages in September.  In addition, the latest  data indicate that motor vehicle assemblies 
rose to an annual rate of 12.2 million units last month, nearly ½ million units above the 
pace in September.  Accordingly, the production of motor vehicles and parts is expected 
to directly contribute more than  0.1 percentage point to the cha nge in total IP in October.  
Excluding electricity and motor vehicles, output in industries for which we have weekly 
physical product data—principally, crude oi l and refinery products, iron and steel, 
appliances, meat products, and lumber and pl ywood—was changed little in October.   
 The output of high-technology products decelera ted sharply in the third quarter, because 
of slower production of semiconductors.  Indeed, capacity utilization for the 
semiconductor industry fell to a level more than  5 percentage points be low the rate in the 
second quarter.  Furthermore, industry cont acts report that demand for semiconductors 
was weaker than expected last quarter.  With  sales weak, Intel reports  that inventories are 
still above desired levels, and it hopes to trim the excess in th e fourth quarter by slowing  
                                                
 
2 Continuous processing industries employ small workforces, and thus their hurricane-related production 
cutbacks likely had little effect on the aggregate labor market data for August and September.

output growth.  Indeed, Intel’s latest earnings forecast for the fourth quarter is consistent 
with only small increases in real se miconductor output.  Still, semiconductor 
manufacturers plan to increas e capacity, as evidenced by an  increase in the book-to-bill 
ratio in September of the producers of semiconductor equipment.    
 Production of computers and co mmunications equipment posted solid gains in the third 
quarter, but the forward-looking indicators of activity are mi xed.  In September, orders 
for computer equipment rose, but orde rs for communications equipment fell. 
Gartner’s forecast of fourth-quarter PC sale s is consistent with a moderate gain in 
production.  Gartner reports that  consumer demand has been sluggish, and they expect 
the holiday shopping season to be a disappointing one, in part because PCs are currently lacking any new "must-have" features.  CIO Magazine  diffusion indexes for future 
spending on computer hardware and on networ king equipment moved up in October after 
having fallen in the previous month.   Outside of transportation and high-tech, produc tion of business equipment jumped at an 
annual rate of 11 percent in the third quarter, about the same pace as in the second quarter.  Within business equipment, gains were especially pronounced for electrical 
equipment and farm, construction, and semiconductor machinery.  The output of consumer goods was up a bit in the third quart er, as a decrease in consumer durables was 
more than offset by a gain in consumer nondur ables.  Construction supplies and business 
supplies both posted moderate increases.  The forward-looking indicators of near-ter m production suggest that activity in the 
industrial sector will continue  to expand at a moderate pace in coming months.  For 
example, the ISM index of new orders in Oc tober was changed little from its elevated 
level in the prior month, and the index of  new export orders moved up.  The various 
regional diffusion indexes of new orders, some  of which are availa ble through October, 
also point to further gains.  Smoothing thr ough the substantial volat ility in the staff’s 
series on real adjusted durable goods orders , the three-month moving average moved up 
0.6 percent in September.  
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of new autos and light trucks rose in  September to an an nual rate of 17.4 million 
units, fueled by a jump in incentives near the close of the month.  For the third quarter as 
a whole, sales were at a 17.1 million unit rate, about ½ million units stronger than the 
pace in the first and second quarters.  We estimate that the more generous level of 
consumer incentives, which moved up $260 per vehicle on average in the third quarter, 
explains about half the gain.  Incentives fell back in October, and industry contacts 
report, on a confidential basis, that the pace of  light vehicle sales last month will likely 
come in between 16½ and 17 million units.  
The Michigan SRC index for motor-vehicle- buying conditions rose in September and in 
October―an increase supported by the perception of low prices among survey 
respondents.  High gasoline prices rema in a concern, though the percentage of

 Because of the relatively strong sales of li ght motor vehicles in recent months, days’ 
supply fell in the third quarter to about 73 da ys, although this level was slightly above the 
target range of manufacturers.   Motor vehicle production decl ined in September, but the 
latest estimates for October indicate that assemblies jump ed to an annual rate of 
12.2 million units last month, nearly ½ million units above the pace in September.  For 
the fourth quarter as a whole, the automake rs’ production schedules call for a step-up in 
the average pace of assemblies from their thir d-quarter level.  However, General Motors 
announced plans to take advantage of the winter holiday shutdown by closing several 
plants for an additional week in the firs t quarter of 2005 in order to address any 
remaining inventory overhang.  
Consumer Spending 
Real consumer spending rebounded strongly in the third quarter , rising at an annual rate 
of 4.6 percent after having advanced only 1.6 percent in the second quarter.  Excluding 
motor vehicles, outlays increased at a 3.5 pe rcent pace in the third quarter, after a 
2.0 percent rise in the second quarter.      
 Total real PCE moved up 0.5 percent in Septem ber.  Outlays for motor vehicles ramped 
up last month, as did purchases of other goods .  Spending on services jumped, in part 
because outlays for electricity were boosted by unseasonably warm weather.

Real disposable personal income increased 1.4 percent in the third quarter, down from the 
2.4 percent pace of the second quarter.  The hu rricanes had a slightly negative effect on 
income in the third quarter:  The boost fr om additional insurance payouts from firms 
nearly offset the loss of rental and proprieto rs’ income because of damage to uninsured 
property.  Even excluding hurricane effects, re ntal and proprietors’ income declined in 
the third quarter.  In contrast , real wage and salary disbur sements stepped up last quarter 
as a result of a larger increase in hours work ed and an easing of c onsumer energy prices.  
Government transfer payments were flat in  the third quarter, held  back by the BEA’s 
assumption that the expiration on June 30 of th e temporary increase in the federal share 
of Medicaid costs enacted in 2003 would re sult in a sharp drop in payments to 
individuals.  
 On net, the gain in income fell short of the increase in total spending in the third quarter, 
and the personal saving rate dropped to 0.4 per cent.  Meanwhile, lowe r equity prices and 
rising house prices have combined to hold the ratio of household wealth to income nearly 
unchanged this year.  Both the Michigan SRC’s index of consum er sentiment and the Conference Board’s 
index of consumer confidence moved down in October, damped by deteriorating 
assessments of expected economic conditions .  The levels of the indexes are roughly 
consistent with the current confi guration of economic fundamentals. 
 
Housing Markets  
Starts of single-family homes fell to an a nnual rate of 1.54 million units in September, 
well below the average of the previous three months.  However, permit issuance—
adjusted for activity in areas where perm its are not required—remained strong at 
1.60 million units.  In addition, the permit back log rose substantially, suggesting that 
starts likely bounced back in October against a backdrop of relatively favorable mortgage 
rates.
3  In the multifamily sector, starts ro se to an annual rate of 360,000 units in 
September, somewhat higher than the average pace earlier this year.  Permit issuance for 
multifamily units also was strong, and the backlog of permits inched up. 
 Home sales remained robust in September.  Sales of existing homes rose 3 percent in 
September, to an annual rate of 6.75 million un its, while sales of new homes were at an 
annual rate of 1.21 million units for the month of September.  Both sales figures for 
September were somewhat above the average du ring the first eight months of this year, 
though slightly below the record highs posted this last spring.  Recent indicators point to 
continued strong housing demand in the near term.  Rates on thirty-year conventional 
mortgages turned up briefly last spring but have since reversed most of the earlier 
increase; the most recent read ing, at 5.64 percent, is about 24 basis points less than the 
average since the beginning of  2004.  Partly in response to the drop in mortgage rates  
                                                
 
3 The hurricanes that made landfall in the Gulf regi on in September—Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne—do not 
appear to be responsible for the dec line in starts in that month:  The largest declines in September starts 
were in the West and Northeast; starts in  the South were essentially unchanged.

during the past few months, the four-week m oving average of mortgage applications to 
purchase homes has risen substantially over the same period.  However, the Michigan 
Survey’s gauge of homebuying attitudes dropped in October to the lowest level since 
early 2003, in part because respondents saw less  investment potential  in homes and less 
reason to buy in advance of  rising mortgage rates. 
 
Prices of existing homes have continued to pos t substantial increases, but the most recent 
data suggest some moderation in prices of new homes.  The average price of existing 
homes purchased in September was up 9½ percent from a year earlier, similar to the year-
over-year readings over the past few months.  The twelve-month change in the average 
price of new homes averaged 11¾ percent fr om June through August but was essentially 
unchanged in September.4  The constant-quality price index for new homes, which 
controls for changes in the geographic compos ition of sales, home size, and a few other 
readily measurable attributes, was up 6¼ percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, 
but down about 2 percentage points from  the average pace earlier this year. 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real outlays for equipment and software are es timated to have expanded at an annual rate 
of 15 percent in the third quarter, after a similar-sized gain in the second quarter.5  The 
brisk third-quarter pace was consistent w ith the relatively favorable underlying 
fundamentals of capital spending:  Business outp ut continues to post so lid gains, the user 
cost of capital is low, and corporate co ffers are flush with liquid assets.   
 
The partial-expensing provision of the curren t tax code should be encouraging businesses 
to accelerate capital expenditures in order to take advantage of the tax incentive before it 
expires at the end of the year .  To date, the evidence suggests that the law is having an 
effect, although the magnitude of the effect is uncertain.  The most recent anecdotes  
provide mixed signals about the strength of th e effect:  Although onl y about 12 percent of 
the respondents to a special question in the Empire State Manufacturing Survey thought 
partial expensing was encouraging more capit al expenditures, about  one-fourth of the 
respondents to the Philadelphia Fed’s Bu siness Outlook Survey gave a favorable 
response to a similarly worded question.  Furt her, about half of the respondents to a 
NABE survey question indicated that the impe nding expiration of the partial-expensing 
provision was having a small effect on the timi ng of capital expenditures, while another 
10 percent indicated that it was having a significant effect.   
 Data on purchases of capital goods also lend su pport to the view that partial expensing 
may be having some effect.  The tax provision allows firms to boost the percentage of the 
cost of a capital good that can be written off in th e first year of service.  This provision is 
                                                
 
4 The twelve-month change in the average price of new homes in September was held down, in part, by a 
jump in the average price of new homes in the previous September. 
5 The staff’s third-quarter estimate  of the increase in spending on equipment and software is about 
0.2 percentage points more than the BEA’s advance estimate.  The upward revision is based on revised 
September data for shipments of capital goods, which became available after the NIPA report. 
II-18 
relatively advantageous for equipment that ordinarily would be depreciated slowly.  
Indeed, nominal shipments of longer-lived  equipment—which includes industrial and 
metalworking machinery as well as electri cal, medical, and certain transportation 
equipment—accelerated of late, jumping at an  annual rate of 15 percent in the third 
quarter, while shipments of shorter-lived equipment—such as computers and 
communications equipment—rose only modes tly by previous standards.  Of course, 
because other factors besides partial expensing are also a ffecting business investment 
decisions, comparisons of this sort do not provide definitive  evidence about the 
magnitude of the partial-expensing effect.         More broadly, real outlays for non-high-tech, non-transportation equipment soared in the 
third quarter; the 21 percent (annual rate) ga in was the largest increase in a decade.  
Although, as noted above, the category’s strong pe rformance is probably in part the result 
of the partial-expensing tax pr ovision, other forces are also likely driving investment in 
this category.  Nominal shipments of farm  machinery and constr uction machinery have 
recently been boosted by the vigorous pace of real activity in the agriculture and residential construction sectors.   Likewise, shipments of oilfield machinery have probably 
benefited from high oil prices, and shipment s of rail equipment are likely rising in 
response to high levels of freight demand.  Orders of non-high-te ch, non-transportation 
equipment have been above shipments for nearly a year, a tre nd that bodes well for 
spending in this category in coming months.  Real business spending on transportation equipm ent rose at an annual rate of 29 percent 
in the third quarter despite a sharp drop in  domestic deliveries of aircraft.  Business-
sector demand for motor vehicles remains st rong.  In particular, sales of medium and 
heavy trucks moved up to an annual rate of  almost 450,000 units in September, a level 
not seen since July 2000.  Orders for these trucks ticked down in September but remained 
near record levels.  Industry sources report th at the surge in orders for heavy trucks this 
year reflects an overall rise in freight sh ipping as well as some pent-up demand for 
equipment replacement after three years of w eak purchases.  Truck manufacturers also 
report that the partial-expensing provision may be prompting some trucking firms to 
accelerate the pace of purchases this quarter.    Real outlays for high-tech equipment and software expanded at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent in the third quarter, a step-down fr om the second-quarter pace.  The high-tech 
slowdown last quarter reflected a sharp decel eration in real spending for computers, 
software, and communications equipment.

Nonresidential Construction   
We estimate that real business investment in  nonresidential structures, which had turned 
up in the second quarter, posted a sm all decline in the third quarter.7  Spending for 
commercial structures, which include retail buildings and warehouses, advanced briskly 
in both the second and the third quarters.  Vacan cy rates for retail buildings remained low 
through the third quarter, and both rents and prop erty values continued to rise.  Property 
values for warehouses also have trended up dur ing the past few years,  but rents turned up 
only recently.  In contrast to spending fo r commercial structures, spending for office 
buildings has remained weak.  The vacancy  rate for office buildings has receded 
somewhat during the past two quarters but rema ins at a high level; o ffice rents have been 
declining for some time, although property values recently posted a small increase.  
Similarly, although outlays for manufacturing st ructures increased in  the third quarter, 
they remain depressed compared with th e levels seen in 2000 and 2001.  Spending on 
drilling and mining structures has risen smar tly in recent quarters on the strength of a 
rising number of natural gas drilling rigs in op eration; the number of  petroleum rigs has 
been flat since the beginning of 2002.   
 
Business Inventories 
We estimate that real holdings of nonfarm i nventories excluding fini shed motor vehicles 
increased at an annual rate of $68 billi on in the third quarter after a $42 billion 
accumulation in the second quarter. 8  The jump in non-auto stockbuilding is estimated to 
have contributed 1 percentage point to the ch ange in real GDP last quarter.  The solid 
pace of stockbuilding in the third quarter was accompanied  by rising sales; accordingly, 
both book-value ratios and NIPA inventories-sales ra tios held fairly stead y at low levels.   
 
Data from the staff’s flow-of- goods inventory system indicate th at overall days’ supply of 
inventories edged down to a record low in  September.  Only a few industry groups, 
including motor vehicles, semiconductors, paper, and chemicals excluding pharmaceuticals, were estimated to have been holding elevated inventories.   
 
Federal Government Sector 
Since mid-September, two major tax bills and three appropriations bills have cleared the 
Congress and have been signed into law by the President.  In addition, the final Monthly 
Treasury Statement for fiscal 2004 has been releas ed.  For the fiscal year as a whole, the 
unified budget deficit was $413 billion, or about  3½ percent of GDP, the largest share of 
GDP since 1993.   
                                                
 
7 In the advance GDP estimate, which was released befo re the September construction data were available, 
the BEA estimated that real outlays for nonresidential structures incr eased at an annual rate of 1¼ percent 
in the third quarter.  However, the September construction data were weaker than the BEA had assumed, 
and the level of spending was revise d down in the previous two months.  The most recent data indicate that 
real outlays for nonresidential structures declined at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the third quarter. 
8 Our third-quarter estimate is $2 billion less than the figure published by the BEA because we have 
incorporated data on book-value inventories held by manufacturers; these data were not available in time for the BEA’s advance report.

For the month of September alone, the fede ral unified budget record ed a surplus, as it 
typically does.9  Receipts in September rose 8 percent relative to the year-earlier level.  
Corporate income tax payments were strong be cause of a sizable gain in taxable profits 
over the period as well as an increase in the e ffective tax rate.  For fiscal year 2004 as a 
whole, receipts rose 5½ percent, only a bit sl ower than the rise in nominal GDP.  Recent 
tax cuts are estimated to have held down th at figure 5 percentage points, and receipts 
were 16¼ percent of GDP, near the bottom of  the range that has prevailed during the 
postwar period.  
 Outlays in September, adjusted for payment tim ing shifts and financial transactions, rose 
only 1 percent over the year-ear lier level; this is a sharp step-down from the pace of 
spending growth seen earlier in the year a nd reflects a combination of economic and war-
related developments, policy actions, and one -time accounting changes.  For the fiscal 
year as a whole, total outlay s rose about 6 percent.  Outla ys for defense, Medicare, and 
Medicaid posted relatively large increases; outl ays for debt service rose at a slow pace; 
and outlays for income security actually fell, largely as a result of declining payments of 
unemployment benefits.  In fiscal 2004, outla ys were 20 percent of GDP, about the same 
proportion as in the pr eceding fiscal year. 
 
In late September, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 was enacted.  The key 
provisions extend marriage penalty relief, th e $1,000 child tax credit, and the expanded 
10 percent individual income tax bracket through 2010.  The act also extends AMT relief 
and several expiring tax provi sions, including the research  and experimentation tax 
credit, through 2005.  The official ten-year over all budget cost of this bill is estimated to 
be nearly $150 billion.    In late October, the American  Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was si gned into law.  It contains 
a smorgasbord of provisions that on bala nce were scored by the Joint Committee on 
Taxation as revenue-neutral over ten years.  Its main purpose is to repeal the exclusion 
from U.S. taxable income of a certain percenta ge of income from the sale of domestically 
produced goods abroad—so-called extrater ritorial income—that the World Trade 
Organization had ruled an illega l export subsidy.  To compensate firms for this loss of tax 
benefits, the legislation provi des broad-based tax relief for domestic manufacturing firms 
and U.S. multinationals.  Key provisions incl ude a phased-in reduction of 3 percentage 
points in the effective tax rate on the profits  of domestic manufacturers, broadly defined, 
whether or not they are exporters; an exte nsion of small-busine ss expensing provisions 
for two more years; a one-time, substantial re duction in the tax rate  on repatriated foreign 
earnings, which is estimated to induce a capit al inflow of about $150 billion next year; 
several tax breaks for the energy industry; and an extension of certain customs user fees.  
 Only four of the thirteen regular appropria tions bills for fiscal 2005 have cleared the 
Congress and been signed by the Presiden t.  Among those signed are the military 
construction bill that includes $14½ billion in disaster aid for victims of hurricanes and  
                                                
 
9 In September, estimated payments are due from both individuals and corporations.

for ranchers and farmers affected by drought  conditions.  Congressional leaders have 
indicated that their goal is to combine the remaining appropriations bills into a single 
omnibus bill that would be enacted when th e Congress reconvenes af ter the election.  In 
addition, the Congress will have to pass an incr ease in the debt ceiling because the legal 
limit has been reached. 
 
State and Local Governments  
Real expenditures by state a nd local governments are estimated by the BEA to have 
fallen at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter after having risen nearly 
2 percent in the second quarter.  The enti re decline was in co nstruction spending.  
Moreover, data on construction received afte r the GDP report suggest  that construction 
spending in the third quarter will be revised down.  Much of the weakness in the third 
quarter was in construction of highways and streets. 
 
The election results for most of the citizen in itiatives or legislative referenda affecting 
taxes went in favor of higher taxes.  Five of the seven m easures to raise taxes passed.  
However, all of these measures , including the three cigarette ta x hikes, will likely have a 
relatively minor effect on revenue collections.  Both measures that sought to reduce or 
limit taxes failed.  
Prices 
Consumer prices have continued to rise at a moderate pace.  The overall CPI increased 
0.2 percent in September and rose at an a nnual rate of just ½ percent over the June- 
September period, the result of a dip in c onsumer energy prices.  During the twelve 
months ending in September, consumer prices  advanced 2½ percent, about ¼ percentage 
point more than in the preceding year.  The core CPI moved up 0.3 percent in September.  
Over the twelve months ending in September,  core prices increased 2 percent, about 
¾ percentage point more than in the preceding year.  Core PCE prices were flat in August 
and rose 0.1 percent in September.  The co re PCE price index increased 1½ percent 
during the twelve months ending in Septembe r, ½ percentage point more than in the 
preceding year.   
 Consumer energy prices fell 0.4 percent in September, the third consecutive monthly 
decline in this index, as gasoline margins plummeted from their levels at midyear.  
However, the continued ascent of oil prices is now showing through to gasoline prices.  
The downward pressure on gasoline markups ov er the summer, due in part to weak 
vacation driving, disappeared in mid-September,  as gasoline inventories declined from 
plentiful to normal because of refinery shut downs related to Hurricane Ivan.  Surveys of 
wholesale and retail gasoline pric es point to a shar p upturn in prices in October.  The 
refinery shutdowns also led inventories of fu el oil to be drawn down to very low levels, 
and, as a result, heating oil markups have rise n.  Moreover, the increasing prices for fuel 
oil have spurred some industria l users to switch to natural ga s, and this switch has pushed 
up natural gas prices considerab ly.  Over the twelve months ending in September, energy 
prices in the CPI rose nearly  7 percent after having climbed 15 percent in the year-earlier 
twelve-month period.  The year-over-year ju mps in the PPIs for finished and crude 
II-28 
energy prices are even larger than the rise in the CPI for energy ―9 percent and 
20 percent, respectively.   
 Consumer food prices were flat in September and inched up 0.1 percent in August.  After 
large gains earlier in the year , prices for meats and poultry ha ve increased at a moderate 
pace in recent months, and prices for dairy products have declined.  Between September 
2003 and September 2004, food prices rose 3¼ pe rcent after their 2½ percent increase in 
the previous twelve months.  Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.3 pe rcent in September after a 0.1 percent 
uptick in August.  September’s increase was le d by a 3 percent spurt in  the price index for 
lodging away from home and a 2 percent jump in  used-car prices.  After its spike in the 
spring, the annualized three-mont h change in the core CPI ha s held below 2 percent since 
July.  Since September 2003, the year-over-year  change in the core CPI picked up from 
1¼ percent to 2 percent.  Core PCE prices increased 1½ percent in the twelve months ending in September, about 
½ percentage point less than the rise in the core CPI.  The ½ percentage point 
acceleration in core PCE prices compared w ith the year ending in September 2003 is a 
touch less than the acceleration observed in the core CPI.  The acceleration that occurred 
in prices for shelter, particularly lodging away from home, receives less weight in the 
PCE price index.  Broader measures of inflation, which had picked  up in the first two quarters of this year 
as energy prices ratcheted up, eased in the th ird quarter.  Over the most recent four 
quarters, GDP prices rose 2¼ percent, about  ½ percentage point more than in the 
preceding four quarters.  Excluding food and energy, GDP prices increased 2 percent in 
the past four quarters, also ½ percentage  point more than in the previous year. 
 Expectations of near-term inflation, as m easured by the Michigan Survey, rose in 
October:  Specifically, median year-ahead  expected inflation reached 3.1 percent, 
compared with 2.8 percent in September.  This  pickup is consistent with the increase in 
consumer energy prices in Oct ober.  Median expected infla tion over the next five to ten 
years, at 2.8 percent, remained  within the relatively narro w range observed in the past 
several years.  Recent readings on the core finished-goods PPI have also been moderate.  Over the three 
months ending in September, this index has increased at an average annual rate of 
1.1 percent, substantially below its pace in the first half of the year.  At ea rlier stages of 
processing, core intermediate materials ha ve continued to ex perience large price 
increases (¾ percent in September) fueled by rising energy costs, higher import prices, 
and the firming in capacity utilization during th e first half of the year.  Prices for core 
crude materials declined 2½ percent in Septem ber but remain 25 percent higher than they 
were a year earlier.  Since the PPI’s Septembe r reporting date, prices for steel scrap have 
jumped again, although prices for lumber and plywood have tumbled.  The CRB spot

industrials index (which excl udes energy prices) has fallen 1½ percent since the last 
Greenbook. 
 
Labor Costs 
The information on labor costs released  since the September Greenbook points to 
continued moderate gains in hourly compensa tion in the third quart er.  The employment 
cost index (ECI) in private i ndustry rose at an annual rate of 3½ pe rcent over the three 
months ending in September—slightly less than  the average pace over the past two years.  
Wages and salaries increased at  an annual rate of 3½ percen t, somewhat above the pace 
of the past few quarters but close to th e average in 2003.  Benefit costs moved up 
4 percent over the thre e months ending in September, th e smallest increase in benefit 
costs in the last couple of y ears and well below the surge in the first three months of the 
year, which resulted from a substantial r un-up in retirement and savings costs as 
employers replenished defined-benefit pensi on reserves.  Although h ealth insurance costs 
continue to increase rapidly, the most recent  twelve-month increase, at 7¼ percent, was 
2¾ percentage points below the year-earlier increase and lower than any twelve-month 
period in the past four years.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Investors paid particular a ttention to higher oil prices, comments by Federal Reserve 
officials, and mixed economic data during the intermeeting period. While high oil prices 
seemed to prompt concerns about the near-ter m prospects for inflation and, at least at 
times, the outlook for economic activity, they di d not appear to fundamentally shake the 
market’s view that the economy remains on a path of moderate grow th.  On net, policy 
expectations for the near future firmed some what and short-term no minal Treasury yields 
moved higher, but longer-term yields were li ttle changed.  Equity prices, which were 
buffeted by fluctuations in the oil market, ed ged up on balance.  Co rporate risk spreads 
were little changed for investment-grade  bonds but moved down somewhat for lower-
rated debt.  
 Merger-related corporate borrowing picked  up over the intermeeting period, but 
corporate debt growth otherwise remained te pid.  Household debt growth, although not as 
robust as it was earlier this year, appears to have remained elevated, mostly because of 
mortgage borrowing.  M2 growth has genera lly been sluggish in recent months.   
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision by the FOMC to raise the target  federal funds rate 25 basis points at the 
September meeting had been widely anticipated, and the accompanying statement 
reportedly was also in line w ith expectations.  The release of the minutes of the August 
FOMC meeting two days late r boosted the expected pace of  monetary policy tightening, 
as investors reportedly focused on the statem ent that “significant cumulative policy 
tightening likely would be needed” to ach ieve the Committee’s objectives.  Those 
expectations, however, were subsequently  damped by the weaker-than-expected 
September payroll data.  On net, near-term policy expectations firmed somewhat over the 
intermeeting period, in part because comment s by Federal Reserve officials suggested 
that the economic expansion was likely to remain on track.  Quotes on federal funds 
futures imply that investors currently place a probability of more than 80 percent on a 
hike of 25 basis points at the November m eeting and smaller odds on a tightening at the 
December meeting.  Further out, policy expectat ions changed little, on net, as the higher 
oil prices and the mixed data releases did not  appear to fundamentally alter investors’ 
economic outlook.    The Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat  over the intermeeting period, as the two-
year yield rose 17 basis points and the ten-year yield was about unchanged.  TIPS 
inflation compensation over the ne xt five years climbed more than 35 basis points, partly 
in response to rising oil prices  and to higher-than-expected re adings on core PPI and core 
CPI for September.  In addition, the size of  the October five-year TIPS auction, which 
was smaller than some market participants had reportedly expected, weighed on the five-
year TIPS yield, thereby boosti ng near-term measured infla tion compensation somewhat.  
In contrast, inflation compensation over the fi ve years starting five years hence was little 
changed.

Corporate Yields, Risk Spreads, and Stock Prices 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  moved about in line with those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, leaving risk 
spreads about unchanged.  Yields on specu lative-grade bonds declined more than  
30 basis points and risk spreads on those securities narrowed, reflecting continued 
improvements in credit quality.  The spread  of top-rated commercial paper over lower-
quality CP issues remained low, as the market has thus far shown little evidence of year-
end pressures.  Broad equity indexes, which were buffeted by oil price fluctuations over the intermeeting 
period, posted a small gain on net.  Technology st ocks rose somewhat more, but stocks of 
insurance companies fell shar ply after the announcement of an investigation by the New 
York State attorney general into business practices by some  brokers and insurers.  The 
gap between the twelve-month forward earni ngs-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the 
synthetic long-run real Treas ury yield, a rough measure of the equity premium, was 
virtually unchanged over the intermeeting pe riod at a relatively hi gh level.  Implied 
volatility of equity prices has risen sli ghtly in recent weeks but remains low. 
 Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Earnings reports, on balance, had little di scernible effect on st ock prices.  Based on 
results from about 80 percent of S&P 500 firms,  earnings per share in the third quarter 
are now expected to be about 15 percent higher than they were a year earlier; this growth 
rate implies that earnings are about unch anged from those of the second quarter on a 
seasonally adjusted basis.  Analysts’ revisi ons to year-ahead earnings were modestly 
positive for the S&P 500 as a whole, as they  were boosted by sizable upward revisions 
for energy firms.  For firms outside the en ergy sector, the revisions were slightly 
negative, a result consistent with the t ypical pattern of downward adjustments by 
analysts.   
 The credit quality of nonfinancial firms c ontinued to improve, and corporate balance 
sheets remained strong.  Net upgrades of co rporate bonds were sharply positive in the 
third quarter, confirming the break from a long trend of net downgrades.  Earnings 
reports of large bank holding companies sugge st that delinquency rates on C&I loans 
continued to decline in the third quarter.  Indeed, according to the most recent Senior 
Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks largely expect that business loan quality will remain good or perhaps even improve somewhat over the next year.
  The six-month trailing 
default rate on corporate bonds remained very lo w.  The expected year-ahead default rate 
derived from Moody’s KMV Corporation was li ttle changed at the relatively low level 
registered throughout 2004.   
 
Business Finance 
Commercial paper issuance surged in Octobe r, boosted nearly $15 billion by Cingular’s 
short-term borrowing to complete its acqui sition of AT&T Wire less.  Excluding the 
financing of that merger, which also account ed for a significant fraction of net issuance 
of bonds by nonfinancial corporations, corporat e borrowing has remained muted since the

last FOMC meeting, as firms have apparently continued to rely on th eir ample profits and 
liquid assets.  C&I loans advanced again, posting a small increase in October after 
moving up more strongly in the third quarter. 
 Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was sluggish in October.  Seasoned 
equity offerings were down, in part because of the reduced demand for deleveraging by energy firms, which had previously been signif icant issuers.  In contrast, initial public 
offerings in October maintained their improve d third-quarter pace, reflecting a few large 
deals as well as an increased number of sma ller offerings.  Meanwhile, equity retirements 
from both merger-related activities and shar e repurchases have accelerated notably, and 
net equity issuance is estimated to have droppe d further into negative territory in the third 
quarter.  The newly passed corporate tax bi ll, which provides incentives for firms to 
repatriate profits earned overseas , could prompt a further increas e in equity retirements in 
coming quarters.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing activity related to commercial real estate remains strong, as the debt increased 
at an estimated 10 percent a nnual rate in the third quarter .  Judging from the heavy 
calendar of commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issues, growth in 
commercial real estate debt is likely to remain elevated in the current quarter. 
 
Investment-grade CMBS yields tracked thos e on Treasuries and sw aps closely over the 
intermeeting period, leaving spr eads little changed at low levels.  Credit quality has 
continued to improve, as delinquency rates on CMBS fell again in September.  The cap 
rate—the ratio of net operating income to pr operty prices—declined further in the third 
quarter.  The spread of this ra tio over the real perpetuity Tr easury yield, a measure of the 
risk premium on commercial real estate a ssets, has narrowed sharply from the peak 
reached in 2001.   
Household Finance 
Mortgage rates declined modes tly over the intermeeting period to the lowest levels since 
April.  Available information suggests that household mortgage debt rose in the third 
quarter at an annual rate of  around 10 percent, down slightly from the robust 12 percent 
pace in the first half of the year. 
 Consumer credit is estimated to have increased  at an annual rate of about 5 percent in the 
third quarter, around the average pace of the past two years.  Hous eholds have probably 
continued to pay down high-interest-rate cons umer loans with some of the proceeds of 
cash-out mortgage refinancings, although the tempo of such transactions has moderated 
substantially in recent quar ters. Growth in consumer debt may have been held down 
recently by increases in consumer loan interest  rates, particularly those offered by auto 
finance companies on new automobiles. 
 
Household credit quality generally remains solid.  Delinquencies on credit card loans in 
securitized pools moved down further in August, while those on loans for new

automobiles at captive finance companies were little changed.  Weekly household 
bankruptcy filings continue to come in around 5 percent lower than they were last year 
but remain elevated when compared  with levels of earlier years. 
 
Working from data for new and existing home sales, we estimate that OFHEO’s repeat-transactions index of home pri ces will show an annualized rise  of roughly 7 percent in the 
third quarter.  Such a reading, along with slig htly lower stock prices , would suggest that 
the ratio of household assets to disposable income was about unchanged over the third 
quarter.  Mutual fund flows remained tepid in September and October, a development 
roughly consistent with our models that link flows to asset returns. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance  
The federal government’s debt reached the statutory ceiling of $7.4 trillion on October 
14.  As in past debt-limit episodes, the Tr easury suspended issuance of state and local 
government series (SLGS) securities and began using other extraordinary financing 
devices to continue to fund government ope rations.  These maneuvers should allow the 
Treasury to operate until the Congress returns from recess in mid-November and can take 
action to raise the debt ceili ng.  The Treasury’s auction schedu le is not expected to be 
interrupted, and the debt-ceili ng announcement has reportedly ha d little effect on yields 
on Treasury securities.  Treasury auctions du ring the intermeeting period continued to 
attract strong demand from indirect bidders—a rough pr oxy for demand from foreign 
official institutions.   
 Early in the intermeeting period, OFHEO rel eased a report critical of Fannie Mae’s 
accounting practices, earnings management, and in ternal controls.  Shortly thereafter, the 
Justice Department and the SEC opened furthe r investigations of Fannie Mae.  Fannie 
Mae’s equity price declined sharply afte r these announcements, but investors were 
subsequently reassured somewhat by the agreement between Fannie Mae and OFHEO 
that addressed some of the regulator’s conc erns, by the testimony of Fannie Mae’s chief 
executive officer at a House committee heari ng, and by the SEC chairman’s remarks that 
the controversy surrounding Fannie Mae’s a ccounting practices was “not black and 
white.”  On net, over the intermeeting peri od, Fannie Mae’s stock pr ice declined about 
6 percent.  The spillover to  Freddie Mac’s stock price was minimal, and spreads on 
agency senior debt changed little. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds for new capital projects picked up in 
October, about matching the robust pace in the fi rst half of the year.  Short-term issuance 
dropped back in October after having been boosted in the third quarter by the borrowing 
needs of Texas and California; the weaker pa ce in October is consistent with a broader 
trend of lessened reliance on such borrowing because of the improved budget conditions 
in many states. 
 
The credit quality of municipal bonds contin ued to improve over the intermeeting period, 
as upgrades of municipal bonds far outpaced  downgrades.  Longer-term municipal bond

Money and Bank Credit 
Growth in M2 has generally been sluggish in recent months, in keeping with rising 
opportunity costs in the wake of the recent policy tightenings and a moderate pace of 
advance in nominal income.  Growth in September was boosted some by an uptick in 
mortgage refinancing, but th is effect has since waned. 
 
Bank credit expanded robustly in Septembe r but likely decelerated significantly in 
October, a result of runoffs in both securi ties holdings and the vol atile “other loans” 
category.  Business loans are on track for a sixth consecutive mont h of expansion in 
October and conditions in that market appear  generally favorable.  Evidence from the 
latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey indicates that, on balance, domestic 
commercial banks continue to see stronger de mand for C&I loans from customers of all 
sizes.  Also, as has been the case for some tim e, the latest survey evidence shows that 
banks have continued to ease standard s and terms for these loans on net.

Appendix  
 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The October 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also contained additional questions 
on recent changes in the degree of competiti on from alternative sources of funds in the 
commercial and industrial (C& I) loan market and on banks = outlook for business loan 
credit quality over the next year.  This appendix is based on responses received from fifty-six domestic and twenty  foreign banking institutions. 
 Both domestic banks and U.S. branches a nd agencies of foreign banks further eased 
lending standards and terms for C&I loans over the past three months.  Banks that eased 
standards or terms reported having done so  in response to increased competition from 
other U.S. banks as well as from a wide range of alternative sources of business credit.  
A sizable net fraction of domestic and fore ign institutions also reported an easing of 
lending standards for commercial real estate lo ans.  On balance, domestic and foreign 
banks reported stronger demand for both C& I and commercial real estate loans.  
Standards and terms on loans to households we re little changed.  Demand for residential 
mortgages and consumer loans reportedly declined, on net.    
C&I lending  
In the October survey, both domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign 
banks reported a further net easing of credit standards on C&I loans.  More than one-
fifth of domestic banks, on ne t, reported having eased their lending standards for large 
and middle-market firms, about the same fraction as in the July survey.  A similar 
percentage of these institutions also indicated that they had eased their lending standards for small firms, a noticeable increase from the 4 percent net easing in the 
previous survey.  The share of U.S. br anches and agencies of foreign banks that 
reported easier lending standards for C&I lo ans was 35 percent, little changed from the 
July survey.  Both domestic and foreign institutions indi cated that they had continued easing many 
lending terms on C&I loans over the past three months.  On net, about 50 percent of domestic banks reported that th ey had narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of 
funds for large and middle-market borrowers , and nearly 40 percent had done so for 
small firms, up from about 30 percent in each case in the July survey.  More than half of 
the foreign institutions reported narrower sp reads on their C&I loans in the latest 
survey. In addition, roughly one-third of both domestic and foreign respondents 
indicated that they had eased terms on cred it lines by reducing the costs of these lines 
and increasing their maximum size.  Almost all domestic and all foreign responde nts cited more aggressive competition from 
other banks or nonbank lenders as the most  important reason for easing their lending 
standards and terms over the previous three months.  About three-quarters of domestic 
banks that had eased their lending posture also  cited a more favorable or less uncertain 
economic outlook as a reason.  Foreign institu tions, on balance, were not as optimistic 
about the economy, but 60 percent, on net, pointed to an increased tolerance for risk as a reason for easing.  The few domestic banks that tightened standards or terms over the 
 III-A-2   
 
 
past three months said they were motivated to do so by a worsening of industry-specific 
problems or reduced tolerance for risk.    Because respondent banks have consistently re ported that they have eased standards or 
terms in response to increased competition from other sources of business credit, this 
survey included two special questions on the nature of this competition.  Forty-two 
domestic respondents and fifteen foreign respondents indicating that they had 
experienced increased competition from other sources of credit this year reported that the greatest increases came from the U.S. commercial banking sector.  For domestic institutions, and especially for the largest commercial banks in the sample, the second-
most-cited competitor was investment banks.  At foreign institutions, the second biggest 
increase in competitive pressure came from other foreign banks.  Both domestic and foreign institutions also indicated increased  competitive pressure from a wide range of 
other sources of business credit.  The majority of those respondents expressing an opinion indicated that the increased competitiv e pressure reflected a permanent, rather 
than a temporary, change in the structure of  the C&I loan market.  However, one-half of 
domestic respondents and about one-third of  foreign bank respondents felt that the 
nature of this shift was not clear at this point.  An additional question asked banks about th eir outlook for the credit quality of business 
loans over the next year.  A majority of the domestic and foreign respondents indicated that loan quality is likely to stabilize around current levels if economic activity progresses in line with consensus forecasts.  On  net, the remaining domestic and foreign 
banks indicated that loan quality would likely continue to improve.  On net, 25 percent of domestic instituti ons reported an increase in demand for C&I 
loans from large and middle-market firms, and 24 percent reported an increase in demand from small firms, smaller fractions than in the July survey.  In addition, 37 percent, on net, reported an increase in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers.  In contrast, only 5 percent of foreign respondents, on net, indicated that 
demand for C&I loans was stronger, while the number of inquiries from potential borrowers at these institutions decreased.   As was the case in previous surveys, most of the domestic respondents that had experienced stronger loan demand c ited as an important reason borrowers = increased 
financing needs for accounts receivable and inventories as well as for investment in plant and equipment. Moreover, almost tw o-thirds of domestic respondents indicated 
that customer borrowing had shifted to th eir banks from other banks or nonbank sources 
of credit because these other sources had become  less attractive.  On the other hand, a 
large majority of the domestic banks that reported weaker demand pointed to borrowers 
leaving their banks for more attractive sources of credit as an important reason.  Additionally, these banks indicated that their customers’ investment activity had declined and that internally  generated funds had increased. 
 
Commercial real estate lending   
Almost one-fifth of domestic banks, on net,  reported an easing of lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the past  three months, double the fraction in the 
previous two surveys.  The net percentage of domestic banks that had experienced an 
 III-A-3   
 
 
increase in demand for this type of loan w as about unchanged from July at 23 percent in 
October.  In addition, 15 percent of fo reign institutions, on net, reported stronger 
demand for commercial real estate loans over the past three months. 
 
Lending to Households 
In the October survey, credit standards on resi dential mortgage loans and other loans to 
consumers were little changed, on net, at  domestic banks. Terms on credit card and 
other consumer loans were also little change d, on net, but a modest fraction of banks 
reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.  Demand for 
residential mortgages and consumer loans c ontinued to weaken.  About 23 percent of 
banks, on net, reported weaker demand for mortgages to purchase homes, compared with 8 percent in July.  Nearly a third of domestic respondents reported weaker demand 
for consumer loans, up from 12 percent in the previous survey.

In August, the value of exported goods a nd services ticked up 0.1 percent following a 
robust 3 percent rise in July.  A decline in ag ricultural exports was la rgely offset by a rise 
in exports of consumer goods, particularly pharmaceuticals, and automotive products.  Exports of capital goods edged up as declines in high-tech goo ds were offset by stronger 
exports of civilian aircraft a nd other capital goods.  Exports of  services edged up slightly.  
At an annual rate, the average value of expor ted goods and services in July and August 
was about 5 percent above the second-quart er level.  The increase was widespread, 
except for exports of agricultural products  and consumer goods, both of which fell. 
 The value of imported goods and services jumped 2.5 percent in August, following a 
1.1 percent fall in July.  A larg e increase in the value of impo rted oil contributed slightly 
less than half of the gain, reflecting both hi gher prices and quantitie s.  Imports of non-oil 
goods also moved higher, led by an increase in industrial supplies.  Imports of capital 
goods edged down entirely on account of decreased imports of aircraft.  Imports of computers and semiconductors were essentia lly unchanged.  Services imports were 
boosted by a one-time payment for the righ ts to broadcast the 2004 Summer Olympic 
Games.  At an annual rate, the average value of imported goods and se rvices in July and 
August was about 10 percent above the second- quarter level.  The rise was fairly 
widespread, with the main exception being consumer goods, which declined.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In September, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core 
goods both increased 0.1 percent.  Foods, feed s and beverages had the largest increase, 
rising 0.8 percent, led by higher vegetabl e prices.  Automotive products increased 
0.3 percent, the larges t monthly increase in this categ ory since October 2003.  After 
increasing a revised 1.7 percent in August, the prices of import ed non-oil industrial 
supplies rose a modest 0.1 percent.  The pric es of capital goods and consumer goods were 
unchanged in September.  Import prices of both computers and semiconductors declined 
in September, falling 0.1 and 0.3 percent, respectively.   
 
For the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, th e prices of imported core goods increased 
2¼ percent at an annual rate.  The rise was concentrated in non-oil indus trial supplies 
and, to a lesser extent, capital goods (e xcluding computers and semiconductors) and 
foods.  
Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil rose 0.6 per cent in September.  In the second half of 
September, the spot price of West Texas In termediate (WTI) crude  oil, a light, sweet 
crude, climbed sharply as the extent of hurricane damage to U.S. oil production and 
pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico became evident.  The spot price of WTI 
averaged $53 per barrel in October, a nominal record, but the prices of heavier, more sour 
(greater sulfur content) types of crude oil did not increase as  much as that of WTI.  The 
sweet-sour price spread has widened consider ably because production of sweet crude in 
the Gulf of Mexico remains diminished, re finers faced with limited capacity prefer 
sweeter crude, and because much of OPEC’s in creased production is sour.  Oil prices in 
general remain elevated because of strong world oil demand and concerns about future 
supply, particularly from Iraq, Nigeria, and Russia.  Supply concerns are heightened 
because of low inventories, particularly of heating oil, and meager OPEC spare 
production capacity.  After reaching record nom inal dollar prices in October, the spot 
price of WTI has edged down recently and, as  of November 2, stood at $49.63 per barrel. 
 Exports.   In September, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods 
increased 0.4 and 0.5 percent, respectiv ely, a partial recovery from August =s declines.  
Much of September =s increase was due to a 0.7 percent in crease in industrial supplies that 
IV-6 
reflected higher prices for chemicals.  In addition, after falling 8.5 percent in August, the 
prices of agricultural expo rts increased 1.6 percent.  E xport prices of consumer goods, 
automotive products, and capital goods (e xcluding computers and semiconductors) 
showed little change.  Export prices of  computers and semiconductors fell 0.1 and 
0.3 percent, respectively.  
 
In the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, th e prices of exported core goods increased 
2¼ percent at an annual rate.  A sharp decline in prices of exported agricultural products 
offset much of the moderate increase in prices of industrial supplies and small increases 
in other categories. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) slowed to $26 billion in August from the strong $59 billion inflow 
recorded in July.  For the two months taken together, private inflow s continued at about 
the same rate as in the first half of the y ear.  The slowdown in private inflows in August 
primarily reflected a shift from sizable net purchases to modest net sales of both Treasury 
securities (line 4a) and equiti es (line 4d); for both types of securities, modest purchases 
from Asia were more than offset by sale s through European and Caribbean financial 
centers.  Private foreign demand for agency  and corporate bonds (lines 4b and 4c) 
remained strong.  Net foreign official inflows ( line 1) were a robust $29 billion in August, reflecting sizable 
inflows from Japan, China, and Thailand, wh ich were only partially offset by outflows 
from Norway and Taiwan.  Partial data on confidential custody holdings at FRBNY 
indicate that foreign official  inflows slowed in September and October, bringing official 
inflows for the third quarter to about $50 bill ion, a further moderation from the blistering 
pace recorded in the first quarter of the year.       U.S. net purchases of foreign securities (lin e 5) eased a bit to $4 billion in August from 
the $17 billion outflow recorded in July.  U.S.  investors made modest net purchases of 
foreign bonds (line 5a) and acquired equities , primarily through a merger-related stock-
swap (line 5c).  A series break in reported  data on U.S. net purchases of foreign bonds 
makes it difficult to compare the net purchas es in recent months with the net sales 
recorded in previous quarte rs.  Reported U.S. net sales of foreign bonds in 2003 have 
been revised down from $36 billion to the currently recorded $24 billion, and further 
revisions are expected. 
IV-7 
 
The volatile banking sector (lin e 3) recorded a moderate inflow of $13 billion in August, 
about offsetting the outflow recorded in July.   When the August TIC data were publicly released on October 18, financial market participants appeared to interpret the data  as showing weakness in foreign private 
inflows.  TIC data for September are expected  in the first week of November and should 
provide more perspective on the trend in financia l flows.  These data will be included in a 
Greenbook supplement.

On net, the dollar’s trade-weighted exchange  value against the major foreign currencies 
fell 4½ percent over the intermeeting period.  The staff’s major currencies index is now at 
its lowest level since mid-1995.  The dollar depr eciated against the currencies of several 
emerging Asian economies, leading the dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value to slip 
½ percent versus our other important trading partners.                   The dollar moved down in respons e to several weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data 
releases, particularly the em ployment report for September (released on October 8).  The 
dollar was also pressured by concerns over the financing of the U.S. current account 
deficit.  This issue attracted greater prominence following the releases in mid-October of data showing a larger-than- expected U.S. trade defic it for August and of Treasury 
International Capital data for the same mont h, which showed a decline from the previous 
month in private net foreign purchases of U.S.  securities.  The increase in the price of 
crude oil was also viewed by some market participants as a negative influence on the 
dollar.        
On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated against all of the cu rrencies in the major 
currencies index.  The sharpest declines were  7 percent against the Australian dollar and

greater-than-expected Chinese economic growth in the third quarter.  A 4 percent rise in 
the dollar price of gold, a major Australian expo rt, also supported th e Australian dollar.  
Robust Canadian economic data, includi ng a stronger-than-expected purchasing 
manager’s report for September, as well as a rate hike by the Bank of Canada, provided a 
boost to the Canadian currency, which reached a 12- year high against the U.S. dollar.     
 
Despite generally lackluster Japanese ec onomic data, the dollar slipped 3¼ percent 
relative to yen over the intermeeting period.  With the yen within striking range of a 
multi-year high against the dollar, Japanese financial officials began to express concern over the move and left the door open for “tak ing action” should the yen continue to 
appreciate.  The dollar al so depreciated 4¼ percent vis-à-vis the euro.  
                      Three-month interest rates for the major indus trial countries were little changed over the 
period for the countries that did not change monetary policy.  In addition to the FOMC, 
the other central bank to adjust  its stance was the Bank of Ca nada, which raised its key  
policy interest rate 25 basis points, to 2.50 percent, on October 19.  The BOC cited a need 
to reduce stimulus to keep inflation within target.  Despite concerns in the currency 
IV-11 
market that higher oil prices would weigh mo re heavily on the U.S. economy than on the 
economies of our major trading partne rs, implied rates on the December 2005 
three-month sterling and euro futures cont racts have fallen 20 and 30 basis points, 
respectively, since the Septembe r FOMC meeting, in contrast to little net change in the 
comparable dollar rate.  In  addition, European bellwethe r bond yields declined over 
10 basis points over the period, compared to a modest increase, on ba lance, in the yield 
on the ten-year U.S. Treasury note.   
 The rise in oil prices weighed on the share prices of firms mo st sensitive to energy prices. 
In Europe and Japan, automotive-sector sub-indexes fell 5 to 6 percent over the 
intermeeting period.  Companies in other he avy-manufacturing industries also felt a 
strong negative impact from the higher ener gy prices.  For the euro-area, losses in the 
shares of energy-sensitive firms were offset  by gains in the technology sector, leaving the 
Euro Stoxx index slightly higher, on balance.  Sharp price declines over the period in the 
S&P 500 insurance and pharmaceutical sub-i ndexes were not matched overseas, as 
market participants deemed the stumbles of  several underperforming U.S. companies to 
be firm specific.  In emerging Asia, the People’s Bank of China raised its one-year lending rate 27 basis 
points, to 5.58 percent, on Oc tober 29.  This was the first time this rate had been 
increased since 1995.  The 12-month Chinese yu an non-deliverable forward contract now 
prices a 3½ percent apprecia tion versus the dollar, up from a 3 percent implied 
appreciation at the beginning of the peri od.  The Korean won and Singapore dollar each 
reached four-year highs against the dollar,  appreciating 3 percent and 1½ percent, 
respectively, over the period.  The Taiwan dollar also rose 1¼ percent against the dollar.  
Market participants report that, for the past se veral years, the financial authorities of these 
countries have intervened to keep the streng th of their currencies  in check.  As their 
export competitiveness vis-à-vis Japan has been a long-standing concern, the 3¼ percent 
appreciation of the yen agai nst the dollar may have led these authorities to be less 
aggressive in their intervention operations.  Higher energy prices weighed heavily on the 
share prices of oil-importing emerging Asian economies.  In contra st, share prices in 
Indonesia, an oil exporter, rose 8 percent.   The rise in the price of  oil also helped the 
Russian economy, as share prices rose 6 pe rcent and Russia’s EMBI+ spread narrowed 
40 basis points over the period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Indicators of economic activity in the ma jor foreign industrial economies generally 
suggest a third-quarter slowdown in growt h.  While labor conditions continued to 
gradually improve in Japan, monthly meas ures of industrial production and household 
expenditure have either been flat or have fallen.  Similarl y, in the euro area the most 
recent data on industrial produc tion and retail sales were bot h below their second-quarter 
levels.  The preliminary estimate of third- quarter GDP for the United Kingdom showed 
growth falling to less than half  of its second-quarter rate.  Incoming data for Canada have 
been better, with retail sales and employm ent both posting gains.  Real merchandise 
export growth slowed from second-quarter rate s in all of the major foreign industrial 
countries, while import growth remained near  second-quarter rates in all countries but 
Canada.   
         Headline rates of consumer price inflation have edged down from their recent peaks.  
Inflation in the euro area slowed to 2.1 pe rcent in September, while Canadian inflation 
fell to 1.9 percent, and inflation in the Un ited Kingdom fell to 1.1 percent.  Slight 
deflation persisted in Japan despit e rising oil and commodity prices. 
 On October 19, the Bank of Canada raised its  key policy interest ra te 25 basis points to 
2.5 percent.   In Japan , indicators suggest anemic growth in the third quarter.  Industrial production 
fell 0.7 percent in September and was down 0.8 pe rcent for the third quarter as a whole.  
Workers’ household expenditures dropped nearly  4 percent in the third quarter.  Real 
exports were flat during the quarter, while re al imports rose about 2 percent.  Average 
core machinery orders for July and August were down 8.3 percent from the second-quarter average.  On a more positive note, the Bank of Japan’s Tankan index of business conditions posted a larger-than-expected gain in September, w ith the level of the aggregate diffusion index 
for business sentiment among firms of all size s and across all industries increasing to 2 
from 0 in June.  However, survey respondents project a slight declin e in the index, back 
to 0, for December.  The index for large manu facturers increased to 26, from 22 in June; 
the index is now at its highest level si nce 1991, although the comparison is complicated 
by a break in the series.  Improvements in  confidence among other firms were more 
modest.   
IV-14 
 
Labor conditions also continued to improve . The unemployment rate declined to 4.6 
percent in September.  The job-offers-to- applicants ratio, a leading indicator of 
employment, rose to an eleven-year high.  Nominal wages continued to fall through 
September.

Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo ar ea (which exclude fresh food but include 
energy) were unchanged in October from the previous month and were down 0.3 percent 
from a year earlier.  Higher commodity pr ices helped to push wholesale prices up 1.8 
percent in September compared with the sa me month a year ago, the largest twelve-
month increase since 1990.

In late October, the Bank of Japan (BOJ ) released its semi-annual "Outlook and Risk 
Assessment of the Economy and Prices."  The BOJ expects growth in FY2004 (April 
2004 to March 2005) to come in between 3.4 per cent and 3.7 percent, and to moderate to 
between 2.2 percent and 2.6 per cent in FY2005.  The report calls  for core consumer price 
inflation of -0.2 percent to -0.1 percent in FY2004.  Notably, inflation is projected to be 
between -0.1 percent and 0.2 percent in FY2005, with a median forecast of 0.1 percent.  
This forecast of positive inflation fulfills one condition for ending the Bank's quantitative easing policy.  However, the report noted th at "it is not certain whether or not the 
occasion will arise during FY2005 to change the present monetary policy framework," 
suggesting that an exit from quan titative easing is not imminent. 
 Indicators of third-quarter activity in the euro area  have generally been downbeat.   
Industrial production fell in August in each of the five largest member countries, causing 
the euro-area aggregate to register its bigge st decline since May 2003.  Euro-area retail 
sales also fell in August, led by sharp dec lines in Italy and Spain.  September data 
showing a decline in French consumption of  manufactured goods point toward further 
weakness in household demand.  Demand from the external sector appears to have 
weakened as well: euro-area export growth slowed in July and August from its second-
quarter rate, while import growth has remain ed high.  German manufacturing orders fell 
1.7 percent in August, led by a 2.1 percent decline in foreign orders.   Euro-area consumer confidence was flat and rema ined at a depressed level.  In contrast, 
business survey measures have been more positive .  While remaining below the long-
term average, surveys of euro-area busi ness confidence rose over the period and now 
stand at a level not seen since 2001.  After falling for several months, the German IFO 
survey of business conditions unexp ectedly ticked up in October.   
 Labor market conditions remain weak in th e euro area, with the unemployment rate 
unchanged at 9 percent in August.  The Germ an unemployment rate remained steady in 
October at 10.7 percent afte r rising slightly the previous month.  Although German 
employment rose slightly in July, the Ma npower Employment Outlook Survey found that 
only 5 percent of German employers plan to  increase staff in the fourth quarter.  
 Likely reflecting the recent r un-up in oil prices, the prelimin ary estimate of twelve-month 
consumer price inflation in the euro area jumped to 2.5 percent in October, after 
temporarily dipping to 2.1 pe rcent the previous month.  The ECB measure of twelve-
IV-16 
month core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed foods, was 2.1 percent in 
September and has remained at or near  this level for most of the year.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose a much lower-than-expected 1.5 percent in the 
third quarter, according to the preliminary es timate.  Industrial production is estimated to 
have tumbled around 4½ percent, offset by an es timated rise in service sector activity of 
just over 3 percent.  Growth in the “distribut ion, hotels and restaurant s” sector slowed to 
just under 3 percent from ove r 4½ percent, consistent wi th recent retail sales data. 
 Indicators for the fourth quart er hint at a pick-up in activ ity.  Business confidence, which 
has been especially volatile of  late, edged up in October, as  did consumer confidence.  
October's manufacturing PMI recovered somewhat  after several months  of declines and 
the services PMI rose strongly. The leading su rvey of retail sales rebounded in October, 
though it remained below its aver age level in recent years.

The labor market continued to be tight, as  the official-claims- based measure of the 
unemployment rate remained near its lowest  point since 1975 and the labor-force-survey 
measure stayed close to its nadir.  The twel ve-month rate of consumer price inflation 
edged down to 1.1 percent in September, well below the Bank of England’s 2 percent target.

In Canada , indicators for the third quarter have been positive.  Canadian real GDP by 
industry rose a stronger-than- expected 0.5 percent in Augus t.  Manufacturing activity 
recorded a 1 percent gain and industrial pr oduction moved up 0.9 percent.  Wholesale and 
retail trade also both advanced robustly.  Residential and non-res idential construction 
activity, in contrast, experience d their fifth-straight monthly declines.  In August, retail 
sales posted the strongest monthly increase since the first quarter.  Despite a second 
consecutive month of declini ng exports, the merchandise tr ade surplus rose in August, 
after narrowing in July, as imports declined sharply.

Total employment grew by a robust 43,000 in Se ptember, following two months of little 
change, and the unemployment rate eased to  7.1 percent.  Overall, third-quarter 
employment growth was in line with th e pace of the first half of the year. 
 In September, the twelve-mont h rate of headline CPI infla tion continued its recent easing, 
falling to  1.8 percent from 1.9 percent in August, as  gasoline prices declined moderately 
IV-19 
for the fourth consecutive month.   The twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding 
food, energy, and indirect taxes, held steady at 1.1 percent in September. 
 
On October 19, the Bank of Canada increased the target for the overnight rate, its key 
policy rate, 25 basis points to 2.5 percent.  Th e move follows a 25-basi s-point increase in 
September.  The Bank stated that because the economy is near full capacity, “further 
reduction of monetary stimulus will be required over time to keep inflation on target, with the pace depending on the Bank’s continui ng assessment of the prospects for factors 
that affect pressures on cap acity and, hence, inflation.”

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Indications from emerging market economies ar e mixed but generally point to a slowing 
of economic growth in the third quarter from the recent robust pace.  China was a notable exception, with real GDP growth rebounding sh arply in the third quarter.  Consumer 
prices in emerging market economies have ri sen on average in recent months, partly due 
to higher oil prices and to a le sser extent to hi gher food prices. 
 Chinese  real GDP growth surprised on the ups ide in the third quarter, rebounding to 
10.1 percent (staff estimate).  The rate of  investment growth, which led to the 
administrative tightening earlier this year, appear ed to pick up again slightly in the third 
quarter.  This is consistent with anecdotes  indicating that investors have found ways 
around the bank financing restrictions the government imposed.  Other indicators, 
however, point to slowing in the economy.  Money (M2) and loan growth have both decelerated significantly in recent months, and import growth has finally begun to taper 
off.  The slower pace of import growth c oupled with continued rapid export growth 
widened the trade surplus signifi cantly in the third quarter.  Twelve-month inflation eased 
slightly in September to 5.2 percent.  Food pr ice inflation has come down from its peak, 
as expected, but non-food prices have move d up recently and are now about 1 percent 
above their year-ago levels.  In response to falling real interest rates, at the end of 
October, the central bank raised the benc hmark one-year deposit and lending rates by 
27 basis points, the first incr ease in about ten years.

Indicators for the Hong Kong  economy remained positive in recent months, although 
less so than during the first half of this year.  Retail sales growth has slowed, after 
booming earlier this year, and the unemploymen t rate decreased a touch in the third 
quarter.  Trade volumes are reaching new record  highs almost every month, as trade with 
China and other Asian economies soars, although the pace of this growth has eased a bit.  
September consumer prices were up a little le ss than 1 percent on a twelve-month basis.

Recent indicators of Taiwanese  economic performance have been mixed.  Industrial 
production fell slightly in the third quarte r, and production of high-tech goods was 
roughly flat.  New orders data, however, point to higher production in the coming 
months.  The unemployment rate moved down a b it in the third quarter.  Both exports and 
imports rose rapidly in the quarter, and the trade surplus widened slightly.  Consumer 
prices are up about 3 percent over the last twelve months, but recent increases in oil 
prices have not yet completely passed  through to Taiwanese consumer prices.

Incoming data for Korea  show few signs of a pickup in the recent sluggish pace of 
activity.  Industrial production was little cha nged in the third quarter, despite a trade-
related jump in output in September.  Cons umer and business confidence remain at low 
levels, and recent indicators of  retail sales and service-sector demand have been mixed.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation was 3.8 percent in October, in part reflecting 
higher food and fuel prices, and core infla tion has been trending up.  Despite rising oil 
prices, the trade and current account surpluses remained at elevated levels in the third 
quarter.

In the ASEAN region, recent performance has been mixed.  In Singapore, real GDP 
declined 2.3 percent in the third quarter according to the advance release, following growth of 12 percent in the pr evious quarter.  Industrial pr oduction also fell in recent 
months, but the September PMI signaled  expansion of production going forward.  
Elsewhere in the region, recent data on indus trial production have been mixed.  Data and 
anecdotes from the region’s high-tech sector generally point to a moderation of growth.  
Recent trade data show the ASEAN economies running trade surpluses.  Consumer price inflation has generally risen across the region, partly in response to a 
jump in food prices in some countries.  The e ffects of the rise in fuel prices on consumer 
prices have been somewhat mitigated by government subsidies in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  The resu lting strain on the government budget has 
worsened already-serious fiscal problems in Indonesia and the Philippines.  With growth weakening, monetary policy has remained accommodative in bot h countries.  In contrast, 
the Thai central bank raised its policy rate  50 basis points in two moves since August to 
1.75 percent.

In Mexico , recent indications are that economic gr owth has stepped down a bit from the 
rapid first-half pace.  Industrial production wa s flat in August, and growth so far in the 
third quarter is below the growth rates in  the previous two quarters.  Similarly, 
manufacturing export growth slowed to a 1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, 
following average gains of 18 percent during the previous three quarters.  However, 
domestic demand appears to have offset some of the slowing in external demand.  Retail 
sales in July and August rose at an 8½ percen t annual rate, more than twice as fast as in 
the previous three quarte rs, and construction activity  strengthened further. 
 Consumer price inflation has c ontinued to increase.  Twelve -month inflation picked up to 
5.4 percent in the first half of October, we ll above the 2 to 4 per cent inflation target, 
driven largely by higher energy and food (primari ly vegetable) prices.  Core inflation has 
risen only to about 3-3/4 per cent, but the Bank of Mexico ha s expressed concern that the 
rise in headline inflation c ould feed into faster wage increases.  Consequently, the Bank 
of Mexico tightened monetary policy on Oc tober 22, the seventh tightening move this 
year.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook  have largely pointed to continuing 
expansion, although probably at a slower pace.   Industrial production rose in both July 
and August.  However, August retail sale s disappointed, with twelve-month growth 
slowing to 7.5 percent, and September vehi cle production declined.  Brazil has continued 
to record sizeable trade surp luses, reflecting strong export growth--over 22 percent on a 
twelve-month basis.  Inflation remains a significant concern; head line consumer price inflation was 6.7 percent 
over the twelve months ending in September,  well above the 2005 inflation target of 
5.1 percent that was set by the central bank in mid-September.  The central bank has 
raised its policy rate 75 basis points since Augus t in two moves.  The most recent change, 
a 50 basis point increase in mid-October, ex ceeded expectations, reflecting the central 
bank’s concerns that recent increases in domes tic fuel prices are feeding into longer-term 
inflation expectations.  Twelve-month-ahead in flation as measured by the central bank’s 
survey of forecasters has recently risen to over 6¼ percent.

In Argentina , the gradual economic recovery has continued.  Industrial production grew 
2 percent in the third quarter, after contracting in the previ ous quarter.  The country has 
continued to run sizable trad e surpluses.  Twelve-month c onsumer price inflation has 
increased in recent months, and now stands at just under 6 percent.    There have also been some notable political  and legal developments in recent weeks.  
First, in mid-October the federal governm ent announced that it had made progress in 
securing the support of provincia l governors for a reform of federal-provincial fiscal 
relations set to take place next year.  Second, in late October the country’s Supreme 
Court ruled that the forced conversion of dollar-denominated deposits into pesos at a 
disadvantageous exchange rate after the collapse of the curre ncy board in 2002 was legal.  
This decision is expected to reduce the thre at of thousands of lawsuits that has hovered 
over Argentina's banking system for more than two years.  Third, the Argentine government has made some progress on its debt restructuring,  including reaching 
agreements to ensure the participation of some  domestic holders of its defaulted debt and 
completing the regulatory requirements needed to conduct an exchange of defaulted debt 
issued in the United States.

In Venezuela , there have been few data releases  since the last Greenbook.  The policy 
environment continues to be poor and infla tion continues to be high, despite the fixed 
exchange rate in place since early 2003.  O il production is still about 15 percent below 
the level prevailing before the national strikes in late 2002.

Recent indicators for Russia  have been mixed.  Industria l production fell sharply in 
August and September and indicators of domes tic investment and construction have also 
slowed.  However, the unemployment rate ha s been declining recently.  Consumer price 
inflation jumped in the last two months, led by food prices.  Both import and export 
demand have been strong, and the A ugust trade balance stood at $85 billion. 
 There were a number of important developm ents in the ongoing tax case between the 
Kremlin and Yukos, the largest Russian oil expo rter.  On the basis of an appraisal of 
Yukos’ main production facility by an inde pendent accounting firm, government officials 
said that they plan on auctioning shares of  just over three-quarters of Yukos’ main 
production facility to settle Y ukos’ tax arrears.  It is not  clear whether the government 
will entertain bids from foreigners or whet her a state-owned company will ultimately take 
possession of the production unit.  Yukos hoped to avert the auction by making a 
$3.5 billion payment to settle the remainder of  its 2000 tax bill; however, on the same day 
as the payment, the Russian government serv ed Yukos with a $6.7 billion tax claim for 
2002.  Although a sale is increasingly likely, stat ements made by officials indicate that it 
would likely not take place this month.
