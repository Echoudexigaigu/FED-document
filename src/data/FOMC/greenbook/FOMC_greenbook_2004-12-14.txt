Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
 
Overview 
Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate rate.  Real consumer spending 
excluding motor vehicles has increased at a so lid pace in recent months, and shipments of 
capital goods have remained on a steep uptre nd.  Taken together, the employment gains 
in October and November indicate that the la bor market continues to improve gradually, 
and manufacturing producti on has—aside from hurricane -induced volatility—expanded 
at a modest pace in recent months.  Core consumer price inflation remains subdued, but 
overall consumer price inflation has been  boosted by higher energy price inflation.  
 
Labor Market Developments 
After posting a robust gain of 279,000 in Octobe r, private nonfarm payroll employment 
rose 104,000 last month.  Smoothing through the recent swings, the three-month moving average of monthly employment changes has moved up since the middle of the year and 
currently stands at 160,000.  
 
By industry, employment in retail trade turn ed down in November, as seasonal hiring was 
relatively weak.  In contrast, construction em ployment rose again last month after an 
outsized increase in October, when hiring was boosted by hurricane-rel ated repair work.  
Employment in professional and business se rvices, nonbusiness services, and financial 
services also experienced so lid gains in the past two months, while manufacturing jobs 
edged down.     Despite continued growth in employment, aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payro lls fell 0.2 percent in November, as the 
workweek edged down 0.1 hour, to 33.7 hours.   Aggregate hours last month stood 
0.3 percent above their third-quarter average.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.4 percent last month, while the labor force participation rate m oved up 0.2 percentage point, to 66.1 percent.  
The employment-population ratio, which combin es these two series, rose 0.2 percentage 
point in November, to 62.5 percent, a level still well below its peak in 2000 and a bit 
below its average level in the mid-1990s.  Th e number of persons working part-time for 
economic reasons as a share of total employme nt fell in November but remained close to 
the highs reached last year.  Although these indicators improved last month, they still 
suggest that some measurable sl ack remains in the labor market.

 Layoffs appear to have changed little of la te.  The four-week moving average of initial 
claims for unemployment insurance remained near 340,000 in recent weeks, close to the narrow range that has prevailed since the spri ng.  In addition, layoff announcements have 
been relatively flat, on balance, in recent months.    
Hiring indicators have been mixed in recent months.  The exhausti on rate—the share of 
individuals who exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits without finding a job—
has been trending down this year, while th e job openings rate published by the BLS has 
continued to move up, on net.  In contrast, th e BLS hires rate has moved sideways in the 
past few months after some improvement ear lier in the year, and the National Federation 
of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported th at, after some tightening early this year, 
vacancies have not recently become appreciably harder to fill.  Fina lly, the NFIB index of 
hiring plans and the Conference Board’s measure of individuals’ percep tions of jobs also 
have both been flat recently.   The staff estimates that output per hour in th e nonfarm business sector rose at an annual 
rate of 1.4 percent in the thir d quarter, about 0.4 percentage  point less than the published 
figure.

Industrial Production 
After smoothing through the effects of weat her-related disruptions, activity in the 
industrial sector has advanced at a moderate pace in recent months.  From July to 
October, industrial production (IP) m oved up, on average, 0.4 percent per month.2  
Production worker hours for November, coupled with the physical product data in hand, 
suggest that production expanded a little mo re slowly last month.  Although many 
manufacturing industries are still operating below capacit y, the overall factory operating 
rate continued to rebound; with the incr ease anticipated in November, it will have 
returned to about the level observed in early 2001.3 
 According to Ward's latest estimates, motor vehicle assemblies held steady in November 
at an annual rate of 12 mill ion units.  Schedules currently  call for production to move up 
a bit further in December and again in the firs t quarter of next year.  Given the current 
inventory situation, the scheduled producti on increase is a little puzzling, and an 
underbuild in the first quarte r of next year would be ne ither surprising nor unusual. 
 The production of high-tech goods advanced at a below-par pace in th e third quarter, with 
semiconductor production having been particular ly lackluster last quarter.  Further, 
semiconductor output increased only 1 percent in October, a pace well below the average 
monthly increase of about 3 pe rcent recorded over the past  ten years.  Accordingly, 
capacity utilization at semic onductor-making plants slipped fu rther, to 74 percent in 
October, a level more than 20 percentage poi nts below the recent peak in February.  
Much of the slowdown likely reflected effo rts by Intel and others to work down an 
undesired buildup of inventories that began last spring.  Ho wever, Intel has reported a 
noticeable acceleration in demand and a signifi cant reduction in inventories this quarter, 
both of which bode well for production in coming months.   
                                                
 
2 Although the exact magnitude of hu rricane-related effects is difficult to determine, we estimate that 
hurricanes held down the change in total IP by ½ percentage point in September and boosted it by ¼ percentage point in October. 
3 The IP annual revision, which w ill be released on December 22, is not expected to have a noticeable 
effect on the current utilization rates for manufactur ing.  However, updated source data for capacity at 
mines and utilities suggest that utilization rates will be revised up a bit for these categories.

 Apart from semiconductors, the rise in pr oduction of high-tech equipment has been 
uneven.  The production of communications equipment posted a small gain in October after having jumped at an annual rate of 23½ percent in the third quarter.  Moreover, 
available indicators suggest a guarded near-term outlook, with contacts at Cisco and 
elsewhere in the industry reporting that firm s are not yet investi ng heavily in next-
generation communications technologies.  Mean while, the output of computer equipment 
has recorded only modest gain s in recent months, although Gart ner’s latest forecast of 
unit PC sales suggests that production may now be accelera ting a little.  
 In the energy sector, production at utilitie s increased 0.7 percent in October after a 
weather-related jump of 5.3 percent in September.  However, weekly electricity 
generation data suggest that output at utilit ies fell in November.  Mining activity—which 
was pulled down in September by hurricane-relat ed shutdowns at oil rigs and refineries—
rebounded somewhat in October.  Available da ta suggest a further advance in November, 
though damage to pipelines in the Gulf of Mexi co is expected to continue to restrain 
mining output for several more months.    The output of business equipment expanded at  a solid pace in Oct ober, continuing the 
robust gains seen over the last three quarters.  The October rise owed largely to gains in 
industrial and other machinery.  In addition, materials output continued to advance in

October.  The production of construction and business supplies also rose briskly, and the 
available data for November suggest that out put in these categories was well maintained 
last month.    On balance, forward-looking indicators sugge st that manufacturing activity will continue 
to expand at a moderate pace in the near term.  The Institute for Supply Management’s diffusion index of new orders rose to 61.5 in  November, a level consistent with ongoing 
gains in manufacturing output.  The diffusi on indexes of new orders published by the 
Federal Reserve Banks also remain elevate d.  Moreover, announced layoffs within the 
manufacturing sector returned to the low end of the range that has prevailed since the 
beginning of the year.  In contrast, the thre e-month moving-average of  the staff’s series 
on real adjusted durable goods orders, which rose only 0.2 percent in October, points to 
smaller increases in production in coming m onths than would be suggested by the other 
indicators.   
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of new motor vehicles dropped to an annual rate of 16.3 million units in November, 
down from 16.9 million units in October a nd 17.5 million units in September.  
Automakers had boosted incentives significantly  in late September to help clear out 
2004-model vehicles.  Since then, however, as more 2005-model vehicles have entered 
the sales mix, the average incentive per light vehicle sold has fallen by about $550.  This 
decline in average incentives, combined w ith high gasoline prices, caused consumers’ 
perceptions of motor vehicle buying conditi ons to deteriorate sh arply in November, 
according to the Michigan Survey Research Center.    Looking ahead, some industry analysts have specu lated that elevated inventories of light 
vehicles will prompt the automakers to la unch a new round of incentives in December 
rather than cut back on production.  If this were  to occur, sales coul d surge near the close 
of the year.    
Consumer Spending 
Real PCE grew at a robust a nnual rate of 5 percent in th e third quarter, pushed up by a 
surge in motor vehicles purchases and solid gains in other categories.  Excluding motor 
vehicles, real PCE appears to be growing at a decent pace in the current quarter as well, 
with this component of consumption up 0.4 percent in October.  Real spending for 
durable goods excluding motor vehicles inched up in October, while real expenditures for 
nondurable goods rose at a moderate rate.  At  the same time, expenditures on services

continued to increase briskly.  More recen tly, anecdotal evidence and weekly data on 
chain store sales suggest that the holiday  shopping season got off to a somewhat 
disappointing start.  Real disposable income advanced just 0.2 percent in October.  Although nominal wages 
and salaries posted another sizable increase, real earnings were held back by a jump in 
energy prices.  Rent and proprietors’ income , which had been rest rained in the third 
quarter by uninsured losses from the hu rricanes, rebounded str ongly in October.  
Nevertheless, the personal saving rate fell to 0.2 percent in October, down from its 
meager 0.5 percent level in the third quarter.
4  The drop in the saving rate probably 
reflects, at least in part, th e rise in the ratio of househol d wealth to income since the 
beginning of the year.  And recent increases in stock prices and ongoing gains in house 
prices have likely provided continuing s upport to consumption spending this quarter. 
 The Michigan SRC’s index of consumer se ntiment edged up in November, lifted by a 
slightly more favorable outlook for curre nt and expected conditions.  Although the 
Conference Board’s index of consumer conf idence has drifted downward recently, both 
sentiment measures remain roughly c onsistent with solid spending gains. 
 
Housing Markets 
Starts of single-family homes rebounded to  an annual rate of 1.65 million units in 
October, a bit above the third-quarter av erage.  However, the signal about housing 
activity from the October data on permits was not as strong:  The number of permits issued—after adjusting for activity in ar eas where they are not required—slipped in 
October and was noticeably below the level of starts.  Multifamily starts climbed to an annual rate of 382,000 units in October, al so above the third-quarter average. 
 Home sales remained near record levels in October, and recent indicators suggest that 
demand will remain at an elevated level in the near term.  Mortga ge rates remain quite 
low by historical standards.  In addition, although the four-week moving average of the 
Mortgage Bankers Associati on index of mortgage appli cations for home purchase—
which trended up from July to early Novemb er—has edged down recently, it remains at a 
very high level.  In contrast, the Michigan  Survey’s index of homebuying sentiment has 
drifted lower, on balance,  in recent months.   
                                                
 
4 Later this month, Microsoft will make a one-time dividend payment of $11 billion, which will 
provide a substantial boost to personal income; however, the resulting decrease in the value of Microsoft 
equity should have a largely offsetting effect on consumer spending.

Home prices continue to rise rapidly a nd by one prominent measure have accelerated 
sharply of late.  The repeat-t ransactions price i ndex for existing homes, which partly 
controls for the composition of homes sold, so ared 13 percent in the third quarter from a 
year earlier, more than twice as much as the comparable reading from last year.  The 
repeat-transactions price index is based both on actual prices of existing homes that are 
sold and on the appraised values of homes fo r which the primary mortgage is refinanced.5  
A version of the index that excludes the appr aised values from refinancings—which are 
not sales prices—was up 10¼ pe rcent in the third quarter fr om a year earlier and shows a 
smoother acceleration in recent years.  Nevertheless, both indexes indicate that home prices have increased significantly in recen t years, with the cumu lative increases since 
the early 1990s being broadly similar.  For new homes, the constant-quality price index—
which controls for changes in the geographi c composition of sales, home size, and a few 
other readily measurable at tributes—moved up 6¼ percent in  the third quarter from a 
year earlier.   
Equipment and Software 
Real outlays for equipment and software are es timated to have advan ced at a brisk annual 
rate of 17¼ percent in the thir d quarter.  The growth of investment spending appears to 
have slowed in the current quarter, but the ga ins in most categories remain quite robust; 
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose considerably in October.  
In addition, the underlying fundamentals rema in sound.  Growth of business output has 
been solid, the user cost of capital has re mained low—held down by low interest rates 
and, through year-end, by the partial-expens ing tax provision—and th e corporate sector 
retains an ample stock of liquid assets.  An ecdotal reports are also consistent with 
ongoing expansion in business spending.   Spending on high-tech gear appear s poised to post a solid rise in the current quarter, after 
a more modest gain in the third quarter.  Although nominal shipme nts of domestically 
produced communications equipment have been relatively flat, on net, in recent months, 
shipments of computers jumped at a monthly ra te of more than 8 percent in October on 
top of a nearly 3 percent increase in September.

5 The repeat-transactions price index is based on a sample of mortgages and therefore excludes home 
purchases not financed by a mortgage.  The sample also excludes subprime, jumbo, adjustable-rate, and FHA- or VA-guaranteed mortgages.   
6 Real business spending on communications equipment edged lower in the third quarter, while 
industrial production of communications equipment increased sharply.  For computers, real business 
investment rose more rapidly than did industrial production.  In both cases, demand for imported equipment 
II-20 
Business investment in transportation equipm ent—which rose smartly in the previous 
two quarters—is likely to be held down this  quarter by a retreat in spending for light 
vehicles.  In contrast, medium and heavy truck sales rose in October to an annual rate of 
more than 450,000 units, and orders continue to run well ahead of sales; sales have 
moved up notably since the begi nning of this year as demand for freight services has 
remained elevated.  Although real business spending on aircraft remains well below its 
peak of a few years ago, October data on nom inal shipments of aircraft by domestic 
producers suggest continue d firming in this component of investment.  
 Outside of the high-tech and transportation se ctors, spending appear s to have continued 
to expand at a robust pace, with real inve stment in this category having jumped 
19½ percent in the third quarter after a sizable gain in the fi rst half of the year.  In 
addition, nominal shipments moved up a good bit further in October.  Some portion of 
the recent strength appears likely to reflect the incentive to invest before the partial-
expensing tax provision expires at the end of this year.  As noted in the November 
Greenbook, investment in the types of equipmen t in this category be nefits especially 
from the tax incentive because the associated  equipment tends to depreciate slowly.  
 
Nonresidential Construction 
Real outlays on nonresidential st ructures were about flat, on net, during the first three 
quarters of the year, and nominal spending slipped a bit in October.
7  Nevertheless, other 
indicators of market conditions show, on balan ce, some signs of improvement.  For retail 
buildings, property values and rents have b een rising, and vacancy rates have remained 
low; for warehouses, property values also have been appreciating, and rents recently turned up.  In contrast, office rents have gene rally been declining for four years, and the 
vacancy rate, although down a bit recently, rema ins high.  The vacancy rate for industrial 
structures also remains high by historical standards.  Inve stment in drilling and mining 
structures has ramped up in recent quarters in  response to elevated prices for natural gas.  
The number of rigs drilling for natural gas moved up further in the past few months, 
suggesting that investment continued to  increase at the end of the year.   
                                                                                                                                                
 
was an important factor:  Imports of communications equipment dropped sharply in the third quarter, while 
imports of computers and peripherals continued to rise briskly.  
7 Nominal outlays have risen considerably faster than real spending this year, reflecting sizable price 
increases in this sector.

Business Inventories 
Real nonfarm inventories excludi ng finished motor vehicles e xpanded at an annual rate of 
about $52 billion in the third quarter.  The s cant data we have for October are largely 
confined to the manufacturing sector and suggest that invent ories were accumulating at a 
moderate pace early this qua rter.  In particular, the book value of manufacturers’ 
inventories rose at an annual rate of about  $26 billion in October, led by another sizable 
rise in inventories at prim ary metals producers and a re sumption of stockbuilding by 
computer manufacturers.  Ho wever, manufacturers’ shipments also rose, and the 
inventory-shipments ratio held steady.  Data from the staff’s flow-o f-goods inventory system indicat e that inventories increased 
in October after having declined in Sept ember and that overall days’ supply of 
inventories edged down further.  Nonetheless, inventories are estimated to have remained 
elevated relative to consumption for a few products, including motor vehicles, 
semiconductors, paper, and chemicals excluding pharmaceuticals.   
Federal Government Sector 
After a series of continuing resolutions, the Congress recently completed its work on 
regular budget appropriations for fiscal 2005, passing an omnibus spending bill covering 
most discretionary outlays.  The omnibus package excluded appropriations for defense 
and homeland security, which had been enacte d earlier.  Budget authority for the areas 
covered by the omnibus bill is slated to increas e about 1 percent from the level in fiscal 
2004, which would keep funding for all discretio nary categories at the level proposed by 
the President early this year.    After adjusting for shifts in the timing of  payments, the federal government posted a 
deficit of $63 billion in Oct ober, about the same as the deficit a year earlier.  On an 
adjusted basis, both outlays and receipts were close to their year-earlier levels.  Daily data 
through November point to a lull in the pace of military spending in the fourth quarter 
after a year of rapid growth.    
State and Local Governments 
Recent indicators are consistent with a mode rate strengthening of spending by state and 
local governments.  Employment rose 5,000 in N ovember after even larger gains in the 
preceding two months.  Nominal outlays for co nstruction projects rose at a solid monthly 
rate of 1½ percent in October, pushing the leve l of outlays back into the elevated range 
seen earlier in the year.  The level of ac tivity had dipped in August and September,

particularly for highway construction; it wa s likely held down, in part, by the hurricanes 
that hit the southeastern st ates in those months.   
 The fiscal stance of state governments continue s to show signs of improvement.  A recent 
survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures on budget conditions through the 
first four months of the fiscal year indi cates that revenue inflows are continuing to 
strengthen, a reading consis tent with other reports.
8  In particular, almost all the states 
reported that revenues for fiscal 2005 are comi ng in at or above target, and only a handful 
of states are reporting shortf alls in their general fund budgets.  However, the states 
continue to face pressures from Medicaid, the expiration of temporary tax increases, and 
the need to restore depleted reserve funds , and consequently many state governments are 
concerned that fiscal difficulties could reemerge in fiscal 2006.   
 
Prices 
Overall consumer prices jumped  0.6 percent in October, as hurricane damage contributed 
to higher prices of food and energy.  Octobe r’s increase boosted th e twelve-month change 
in the CPI to 3¼ percent, up fr om 2 percent in the year-earlie r period.  In contrast, core 
consumer prices continued to increase at a more modest rate; the core CPI rose 0.2 percent in October, leaving the twelve-mont h change at 2 percent, about ¾ percentage 
point more than in the preceding year.
 9  The core PCE price index increased 1½ percent 
during the twelve months ending in October, only ¼ percentage point more than in the 
preceding year.  In part, the smaller acceleration in core PCE prices reflects differences in 
measured medical services inflation and a deceleration in nonmarket prices that are 
included in the PCE index but not in the CPI.10 
 Consumer energy prices move d up 4.2 percent in October, more than reversing the 
declines of the previous three months.  The October increase was driven in large part by 
refinery outages and a surge in the prices of  petroleum and petroleum products associated 
with production losses in the wa ke of Hurricane Ivan.  Gasoline inventories, which were 
plentiful before the storm, fell to normal levels, and wholesale markups jumped in  
                                                
 
8 The survey is scheduled to be released on Decembe r 9, 2004.  It is confid ential until its release.   
9 Even if core inflation in November and December increases at the same average monthly rate as over 
the past twelve months, the twelve-month change in the core CPI would rise ¼ percentage point from its October level, as the unusually low inflation readings  from the end of 2003 drop  out of the most recent 
twelve-month window. 
10 Over the past year, PCE medical services prices have decelerated, while the CPI for medical services 
has accelerated.  PCE medical services prices are base d on PPIs rather than CPIs, and medical services 
have a much larger weight in PCE than in the CPI.

October.  Survey data suggest that retail ga soline prices declined in November, likely in 
response to the $5 to $6 per barrel fall in spot  prices of crude oil between late October 
and mid-November.  In the past week, gasolin e margins have spiked again as a further 
large fall in crude oil prices has not yet been passed through to retail prices.  Retail prices 
of heating oil, which account for only a small part of energy costs, were more severely 
affected than were gasoline prices by th e hurricane-related outages because heating oil 
inventories were thinner than gasolin e inventories before the storm.   
 Consumer prices for natural gas increased 0.6 percent in October, likely because of 
increased demand owing to substitution away fr om high-priced fuel oil.  However, in 
early to mid-November, with gas storage caver ns near capacity, spot prices for natural 
gas fell, reversing the previous month’s rise .  Although these prices  have moved up again 
recently, the ample supplies suggest that prices of residential natural gas this winter are 
unlikely to spike as they did in February 2003.    Consumer food prices increased 0.6 percent in October, as da mage to fruit and vegetable 
crops from the four hurricanes that hit Fl orida in August and September boosted prices 
for these items.  The effects of the hurri canes were most pronounced for tomatoes and 
citrus, for which prices jumped 25 percent a nd 11 percent, respectively.  These prices 
should drop during the next few months as California citrus  and Florida tomato crops 
become available.  Over the twelve mont hs ending in October, food prices rose 
3½ percent, an acceleration of ½ percen tage point from a year earlier.   
 As indicated previously, the twelve-month change in the core CPI has picked up about 
¾ percentage point over the past year.  This  acceleration reflects a flattening of core 
goods prices after a decline of 2½ percent in th e year-earlier period.  In  contrast, the rate 
of increase in core servic es prices was little changed from a year ago.   
 According to the Michigan Survey, median expectations for inflation over the coming 
year returned to 2.8 percent in November , reversing the October uptick.  Median 
expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years edged down a tenth, to 
2.7 percent, and remained with in the narrow range reported ov er the past several years. 
 Price inflation for capital equipment has conti nued to trend upward si nce hitting a bottom  
in 2002.  In October, the PPI for capital eq uipment moved up 0.4 percent for the second 
consecutive month.  Over the past twelve m onths, capital equipment prices have risen

about 2 percent, compared with an increas e of only ½ percent during the year-earlier 
period.  The pickup has been widespread across most types of capital equipment. 
 Prices continue to rise rapidly at earlier st ages of processing.  Over the twelve months 
ending in October, the PPI for intermediate  materials excluding food and energy rose 
7¾ percent.  Nevertheless, the most recent r eading, a 0.3 percent increase in October, was 
a step down from jumps of 0.7 percent in Sept ember and 1 percent in August.  The recent 
increases in prices at this stage of processi ng seem broadly consistent with movements in 
energy costs, capacity utilization, and prices  of imported materials and supplies.  
Meanwhile, the index for core crude material s climbed 5½ percent in October, boosted by 
a run-up in metals prices.  Since the November Greenbook, the Journal of Commerce 
metals index has fallen 0.7 percent.  The CRB spot industrials index (which excludes 
energy) has risen 2.9 percent over this period.  
Labor Costs 
Average hourly earnings growth rose 0.1 pe rcent in November a nd about 2½ percent over 
the past twelve months, a pickup of ¼ percen tage point from the year-earlier period.  
Measures of overall compensation showed mode rate increases over th e year ending in the 
third quarter of 2004; compensation per hour ―as reported in the BLS Productivity and 
Costs release ―was up 4 percent, and the employme nt cost index was up 3¾ percent.
11  
The markup of prices over uni t labor costs remained somewhat elevated for both the 
nonfarm business sector and the nonf inancial corporate sector.   
 The incoming information on benefits pertains mainly to health insurance costs, which 
appear to be decelerating after the outsized increases of the past few years.  As noted in 
the November Greenbook, the twelve-month cha nge in the health insurance component 
of the ECI, which was running about 10 pe rcent in 2002 and 2003, dropped to 7¼ percent 
in September.  The results of the major surveys of employer-sponsored health plans 
spanned a wide range in 2004:  The latest  survey from Mercer Human Resources 
Consulting showed premiums rising only 7½ pe rcent this year, while other prominent 
surveys reported advances of more than 10 percent.  In general, however, the surveys 
confirmed that increases in health insuran ce costs in 2004 were smaller than those in 
2003, and they point to a further moderation in 2005.   
                                                
 
11 The latest Productivity and Costs release incorporated state unemployment insurance data for the 
second quarter, which indicated th at compensation per hour in the nonfa rm business sector increased about 
1 percentage point faster in that quarter than had been previously reported.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview1 
Expectations for the path of monetary polic y over the next several quarters edged a bit 
higher over the intermeeting period in response to comments by Fed officials that pointed 
to higher rates and to some worries about grea ter near-term inflationary pressure.  Short-
term Treasury yields rose somewhat, but ten-y ear Treasury yields were unchanged on net.  
Corporate bond spreads narrowed a bit further, and stock pri ces posted a moderate gain.  
Total net business borrowing ha s picked up in recent months, and household debt growth 
remained brisk last quarter.   
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision by the FOMC to raise the target  federal funds rate 25 basis points at the 
November meeting had been widely anticipat ed and the accompanying statement was in 
line with expectations.  Desp ite the weaker-than-expected employment report released on 
December 3, investors still expect a firmer pace of tightening over coming months owing 
to higher-than-expected infl ation data, remarks by the Chairman providing what was 
viewed to be an unusually stark warning of future rate increases, the ongoing depreciation 
of the dollar, and perhaps the beneficial e ffects of the drop in oil prices for economic 
growth.  Current quotes on federal funds future s suggest that investor s are nearly certain 
of a quarter-point tightening at the December meeting and expect tightening at two out of 
the first three meetings in 2005.  The upward revision in policy expectations s howed through to short- and intermediate-
term Treasury yields, with two- and five-y ear yields up about 15 and 10 basis points, 
respectively, over the period.  Ten-year Treasu ry yields finished th e period unchanged;  
yields had risen earlier in the period on specula tion about official in tervention in support 
of the dollar and reports that foreign official institutions were contemplating paring their 
holdings of Treasuries, but then had dropped sharply on the latest employment report.  
TIPS yields edged a bit lower, implying a bout a 10 basis point rise in inflation 
compensation over the next five years.  Mark et participants pointed to higher-than- 
                                                
 
1 This review focuses on the period since the last FOMC meeting, as is standard practice for the 
Greenbook.  Accordingly, th e effects of the employment report for October, which was released on the 
Friday between the November Greenbook publication date and the November FOMC meeting, are omitted from the discussion that follows.  Nonetheless, we would note that, on the re lease of that report, the 
market’s expected path for the federal funds rate steepened, and intermediate - and longer-term yields 
increased about 10 to 15 basis points.  In addition, broad stock price indexes increased about 3 percent 
between the Greenbook publication date and the FOMC meeting.

expected inflation releases and dollar depreciation as factors contributing to the rise.  In 
contrast, inflation compensation five to  ten years ahead wa s little changed.  
 
Corporate Yields and Risk Spreads 
Spreads on investment-grade and speculat ive-grade corporate bonds edged down about 
5 to 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  A decompositi on of the high-yield 
spread into the compensation for expected losses and the implied risk premium suggests 
that the compensation for risk has shrunk notab ly in the past coupl e of quarters and now 
has moved back down to the range of low valu es reached in the mid 1990s.  The spread 
of lower-quality commercial paper over top- rated CP issues rose only slightly as the 
maturity date of thirty-day issues crossed y ear-end, indicating that expectations of year-
end pressures remain muted. 
 
Stock Prices, Corporate Earnings, and Credit Quality 
Building on the sizable gains logged between  the close of last  month’s Greenbook and 
the FOMC meeting, broad stock price indexe s rose another 1 to  2 percent over the 
intermeeting period, in part from lower oil pr ices.  Implied volatility on both the Nasdaq 
100 and S&P 500 remained low.  The gap between the twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and the synt hetic long-run real Treasury yield, a rough 
measure of the equity premium, remained at a level close to its aver age over the past two 
decades.   November’s spate of third-quarter earnings repor ts from retailers essentially met investor 
expectations and brought the re porting season to a close.  S&P 500 operating earnings per 
share came in about 15 percent above results from four quarters earli er, implying a slight 
quarter-to-quarter gain.  Absent  hurricane effects, the four-quarter rise would have been a 
couple of percentage points higher.  Analysts continued to trim forecasts of year-ahead 
earnings for S&P 500 firms outside the energy se ctor, consistent with  the typical pattern 
of downward adjustments during peri ods of moderate economic growth. 
 The preliminary estimate of third-quar ter NIPA profits, a broader measure of 
profitability, showed an 8½ percent gain over the past year.  Excluding the BEA’s 
estimate of hurricane-related losses, NIPA profits increased 15 percent over the prior 
year, including a considerable rise be tween the second and third quarters. 
 
Nonfinancial corporate bonds experienced a sizable net rating downgrade in October, but 
more than half of the debt downgraded resulted from one large merger—the debt-

financed acquisition of AT&T Wirele ss by Cingular—and the pace of downgrades 
appears to have dropped back in November.  Other indicators suggest that nonfinancial 
firms continue to be in solid financial condi tion.  Nonfinancial corporations continued to 
build on their already hefty cash positions last  quarter.  In addition, Call Report data for 
the third quarter showed a fu rther decline in the delinquency rate on C&I loans, and the 
six-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds remained extremely low in October.  
The expected year-ahead default rate de rived from Moody’s KMV Corporation ticked 
down in October and likely has declined furt her since then in response to the rise in 
equity prices over November and early December.  
Business Finance 
Bank C&I lending was positive again in November, and gross issuance of bonds by 
nonfinancial corporations firmed to its st rongest monthly pace since March.  Borrowing 
in the speculative-grade categor y was particularly robust.  Low rates eviden tly continue 
to be a major factor, as the most popular use of proceeds reportedly was to pay down 
existing debt.  In the commercial paper market, much of the merger-related bridge financing that had boosted October issuance was paid down in November, as we had 
anticipated.  On balance, during October and November combined, net borrowing 
through bank loans, commercial paper, and bond s picked up from the third-quarter pace.  
 Gross public equity issuance continued at a moderate rate in November; initial public 
offerings have continued around the str onger pace since midy ear, while seasoned 
offerings remain off the earlier elevated pa ce observed when some firms were issuing 
equity to improve their balance sheets.  E quity retirements from both cash mergers and 
share repurchases accelerated markedly in the third quarter, placing net equity issuance even further in negative territory.  Retirem ents likely will remain high in the current 
quarter, in part because of Cingular’s acquisition of AT&T  Wireless.  Moreover, the 
anticipated repatriation of profits earned overs eas in response to the corporate tax law 
passed in October could well provide firms with cash to keep equity retirements elevated 
over the next few quarters.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial real estate debt e xpanded at an annual rate of 11 percent in the third quarter, 
and strong CMBS issuance in October and Nove mber points to rapid debt growth again 
this quarter.  The spreads of investment-g rade CMBS yields to comparable-maturity 
Treasuries have remained low.  The various measures of commercial mortgage

delinquency rates have either falle n this year or held at a lo w level, indicating that credit 
quality in this sector continues to be sound.  
Household Finance 
In the third quarter, household mortgage debt expanded at an annual ra te of 11 percent.  
With interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate  mortgages remaining low, mortgage debt 
growth is expected to stay strong in the curren t quarter.  Consumer credit increased at an 
annual rate of 6 percent in the third quarter  but slowed a bit to a 4 percent pace in 
October.  Although household debt has continued to expand  more rapidly than disposable income, 
a downdrift in other household obl igations has kept the financ ial obligations ratio about 
unchanged on net this year.  The ratio rema ins 1/2 percentage point below the peak 
reached two years ago.  Meanwhile, measures of household credit quality have continued 
to improve.  Delinquencies on credit card lo ans, consumer loans, and residential 
mortgages at commercial banks all declined in the third quarter, and those on auto loans 
at captive finance companies edged down in October.  Household bankruptcy filings over the year to date are 5 percent below the co mparable period from la st year, although this 
year’s filing rate remains high compared with earlier years. 
 A rapid rise in existing home prices in the third quarter more than offset a dip in the 
Wilshire 5000 stock price index, contributing to an uptick in the ratio of household assets 
to disposable income.  The gains in stock pr ices registered so fa r this quarter portend 
another increase in this ratio.  Mutual fund flows picked up in November, a move roughly 
consistent with their historical relationship to asset returns.  
Treasury and Agency Finance  
The statutory debt ceiling was raised in mid-November.  Market participants had 
anticipated this outcome, and the Treasury’s financing maneuvers during the preceding four weeks to fund government operations ha d little effect on yields.  November’s 
auction of ten-year notes was met with strong demand, and indirect bidders took up 
40 percent of the issues, sugge sting continued strong intere st from foreign official 
institutions.  With regard to the GSEs, Fannie Mae’s stock price moved down in the wake of the 
presidential election—sugges ting continued close scruti ny of its operations—and fell 
again after the company failed to produ ce a third-quarter accounting statement.

However, the price rebounded sharply on news  of an increase in the conforming loan 
limit to $359,650 in 2005.  Spreads on agency seni or debt have declined as GSE debt 
issuance has slowed in response to more lim ited growth of their mortgage portfolios. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed some in November from its robust 
pace in October to a rate below the average fo r the year to date.  A decline in refunding 
issues can be traced—at least in part—to the Treasury’s decision in mid-October to halt 
its SLGS program to avoid violating the debt ceiling.  The SLGS s window reopened in 
November, which could spur refundings in th e near term.  Short- term municipal debt 
offerings were relatively low last month, as is  consistent with a br oader trend of reduced 
reliance on short-term borrowing due to the im proved budget situations in many states.  
The credit quality of municipal bonds c ontinued to improve, with bond upgrades far 
outpacing downgrades in recent months. 
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 accelerated in November, but the average pace of M2 growth in recent months has 
been relatively slow.  In the quarter to da te, M2 has grown at around a 4½ percent annual 
rate—about as one would expect  in light of the moderate growth in nominal income, 
higher stock prices, and increas es in M2 opportunity cost associated with the recent 
monetary policy tightenings.  The growth of bank credit rebounded in Nove mber, with both s ecurities and loans 
registering notable gains.  Banks posted strong profits again in the th ird quarter, and asset 
quality continued to improve.  Preliminary da ta from the November Survey of Terms of 
Business Lending suggest that spreads on C& I loans rose from recent lows, partly 
because of wide spreads on a few large loans, some to finance acquisitions.

In September, the value of exports of goods and services increased 0.8 percent, matching 
August’s upwardly revised pace.  Exports of goods increased 1.4 percent, with a particularly strong contribution from agri cultural goods.  Exports of capital goods moved 
up as well, as both computers and semiconduc tors recovered from a weak August.  
Services exports declined slight ly, largely on account of a drop in travel-related services.  
Exports of goods and services in the third qua rter climbed 8.4 percent at an annual rate.  
The increase was widespread, except for agricultural products,  semiconductors, and 
telecommunications equipment, all of which fell,  on average, in the third quarter from the 
second quarter.  The value of imported goods fell 0.8 percent in  September, retracing some of August’s 
2.6 percent gain.  Imports of goods declined 0.4  percent, due to a fall in the value of 
imported oil; non-oil imports were little cha nged.  Imports of cap ital goods rose as 
increases in aircraft and othe r capital goods offset declines in high-tech goods.  Imports 
of consumer goods fell for the fifth month in a row, led by a marked decline in 
pharmaceuticals.  Services imports receded near ly 3 percent, as royalty and license fees 
retreated from their elevated August level.  For the third qua rter as a whole, imports of 
goods and services expanded 10.7 percent at an  annual rate.  Gains were widespread, 
with a few exceptions, notably consumer goods.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In October, the prices of U.S.  imports of non-oil goods and of core 
goods fell 0.2 and 0.1 percent, respectively.  Prices  for industrial supplies declined        
1.1 percent, mostly from lower prices for building materials.  For foods, feeds and 
beverages, prices declined 0.6 percent.  With  the start of the new model year, prices for 
automotive products rose 0.4 percent.  Prices for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semi-conductors) edged up 0.1 percent.  Prices  for imported consumer goods, which have 
not increased since February 2004, were uncha nged in October.  Import prices of 
computers continued to decline, whereas  prices for semiconductors edged up.   
 
For the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, the pri ces of imported core goods increased       
2.1 percent at an annual rate, in part due to a rise in prices of non-oil indust rial supplies. 
 Oil.  Oil prices have been extremely volatile  recently.  The BLS price of imported oil 
rose 11.7 percent in October.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a light, 
low-sulfur crude oil, averaged about $53 pe r barrel for the month, a nominal record, and 
$7 per barrel more than in September.  The rise in the spot price was largely due to 
hurricane damage to U.S. oil production a nd pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf of 
Mexico, which disproportionately affected  the supply of low-sulfur crude.  Since 
October, the spot price of WTI has fallen sharply, due in part  to rising oil inventories and 
the return of some Gulf of  Mexico production.  The spot price closed at $41.47 per barrel 
on December 7.  The prices of more sulfurous gr ades of crude oil, which did not increase 
as rapidly as WTI in October, have not fallen as much recently.  The price of imported oil 
tends to move more closely with the prices of  higher sulfur crude oils than with WTI. 
 
Exports.   In October, the prices of U.S. expor ts of total goods and of core goods both 
increased 0.7 percent.  Much of October’s increase was due to a 2.5 percent rise in 
industrial supplies that reflected  higher prices for chemicals and fuels.  The prices of 
agricultural exports fell 1.3 per cent and, since peaking in May, have declined 13 percent.  
In October, export prices of capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and 
automotive products increased 0.4 and 0.2 percen t, respectively.  Prices for consumer 
goods fell 0.1 percent.  As with imports, export prices of co mputers continued to decline, 
and prices for semiconductors rose. 
IV-6 
 
In the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, th e prices of exported core goods increased 
1¾ percent at an annual rate.  A sharp decline in prices of exported agricultural products 
offset much of the moderate in crease in prices of industria l supplies and smaller increases 
in some other categories.  
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
 
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) continued strong at $35 billio n in October.  For the first ten months of 
the year, private inflows into U.S. securi ties amounted to $395 billion, above the $373 
inflows recorded for all of 2003.    Private foreign investors’ purch ases of bonds continued at thei r robust level in October, 
with purchases of agency bonds (line 4b) near $16 billion and corporat e debt (line 4c) at 
about $15 billion.  After two months of consecu tive net sales, private foreign investors 
purchased almost $5 billion in U.S. equities  (line 4d).  For Treasuries (line 4a), the 
strength in private foreign purchases of the pa st few years that accelerated in the first half 
of this year has evaporated; following $96 billio n in net purchases in the first half of the 
year, net inflows totaled only $6 bi llion in the July-October period. 
 Net foreign official inflows ( line 1) moderated to about $17 billion in October, with a 
small outflow from China and sizable inflows from Norway and Russia.  For the first ten 
months of the year, foreign official infl ows were $282 billion, exceeding the $245 billion 
recorded for the year 2003.  Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
(FRBNY) report a large increase in official reserve assets in November,    
        . 
 U.S. investors made large net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) in October, 
following small net sales in September.  U.S.  investors primarily acquired foreign stocks 
(line 5a), but also made modest purchases of  foreign bonds (line 5a).  A series break in 
reported net purchases of foreign bonds makes it difficult to compare current transactions 
in foreign bonds with th e reported sales recorded in previous quarters.  
 The volatile banking sector (lin e 3) recorded an outflow of  $22 billion in October, 
bringing the cumulative outflow for 2004 to $57 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The trade-weighted index of the nominal exch ange value of the dollar against the major 
currencies declined 1¼ percen t on net since the November FOMC meeting.  The index 
would have fallen 2½ percent but for a large jump  very late in the period.  This decline 
came despite generally stronger-than-expect ed U.S. economic data and weaker-than-
expected economic data in Europe and Japan.  Market participants attributed the dollar’s 
decline to concern over the financing of the U.S. current account deficit.  Remarks made 
in the middle of November by Treasury Secr etary Snow and Chairman Greenspan were 
generally interpreted as indicat ing official tolerance for a d ecline in the dollar.  News 
reports suggested that the central banks of  Russia and China may replace (or may have 
already replaced) some of their dollar-denom inated assets with euros.  The dollar 
depreciated 4 percent on net ag ainst sterling and 2½ percent ag ainst the yen and the euro.  
In contrast, the dollar appreciat ed about 2¼ percent against th e Canadian dollar, in part 
on the release of the weaker-than-expected  Canadian employment report for November. 
                   Recent differences in economic performan ce between the United States and other 
industrial countries were clea rly evident in inte rest rate developments. Whereas long-
term Treasury yields were down 5 basis point s over the intermeeting period, comparable

yields on other countries’ government bonds ge nerally declined 15 to 30 basis points. 
Changes in short-term interest rates al so reflected the differences in economic 
performance, with the yield on the U.S. three-month Treasury bill rising 16 basis points versus declines or little change on net in yields of comparable European and Canadian 
sovereign debts.  As had been  widely expected, the Europ ean Central Bank, the Bank of 
Japan, and the Bank of Canada left their re spective monetary policy stances unchanged 
during the intermeeting period.                     Since the November FOMC meeting, broad sh are price indexes in most major industrial 
economies have changed little on net, as lo wer oil prices offset the effects of 
disappointing economic news a nd currency appreciations.   
 The dollar declined 1½ percent on a trade-weig hted basis against the currencies of our 
other important trading partners over th e intermeeting period, led by a 4¾ percent 
depreciation against the Korean  won.  The Bank of Korea cut its key policy interest rate 
25 basis points, to 3.25 percent, in a move that market participants interpreted as, in part, 
aiming at limiting the won’s appreciation ag ainst the dollar.  In addition, Korean 
monetary authorities were active in currency markets in an attempt to slow the won’s Financial Indicators in Major Industrial Countries

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Growth in most of the major foreign industria l countries slowed in the third quarter, with 
a downturn in external demand an important contributor.  Japanese GDP posted a small 
increase, as business investment moderated.  In the euro area, GDP decelerated despite a 
strong advance in domestic demand (including inventories).  Third- quarter GDP growth 
in the United Kingdom was half that of the second quarter, with business investment and 
inventory accumulation making negative cont ributions.  Canadian GDP growth also 
slowed, as a steep decline in  net exports offset solid underlying domestic demand.  Data 
for the fourth quarter suggest further slowi ng of activity in the ma jor foreign industrial 
countries, except in the United Kingdom,  where survey evidence points to an 
improvement in business activity.  Early indicato rs suggest that the f ourth quarter got off 
to a weak start in Japan and the euro area.   Labor markets in the foreign industrial 
economies have been mixed on balance duri ng the past few mont hs.  Unemployment 
rates have held steady in the euro area and the United Kingdom, but have recently turned up in Japan and Canada.  Headline rates of consumer price inflation ea sed in the third quarter before edging up 
slightly in October in the United Kingdom a nd Canada.  Inflation remains above the ECB 
ceiling rate in the euro area, while core cons umer prices continue to fall moderately in 
Japan. 
 
In Japan , newly published chain-weighted national acc ounts data show th at Japanese real 
GDP edged up 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Growth in personal 
consumption slowed a bit to 0.9 percent.  Business fixed investment rose 4.3 percent, 
while government investment dr opped about 8 percent.  Export growth slowed markedly 
and imports jumped.  As a result, net expor ts subtracted 0.4 percentage point from 
growth, marking the first negative contributi on from external demand in two years.  The 
GDP deflator fell 1.2 percent below its year-ear lier level.  The new data also show a 0.6 
percent contraction in real GDP in the second quarter, resulting from a plunge in 
government investment, which subtract ed 3.7 percentage points from growth . 
 
Indicators suggest continued anemic activity at  the start of the four th quarter.  Industrial 
production dropped 1.6 percent in Octobe r, depressed by ongoing weakness in 
electronics-related sectors.  Household expe nditures in October were 0.6 percent below 
their third-quarter average.  Real exports rose  2.5 percent in October, about the same pace 
as the rise in imports.  Core machinery orde rs, a leading indicator of business investment,

fell 1.9 percent in September, leaving orders for the third quarter down 8.4 percent from 
the second quarter.

Labor market conditions were mixed. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent in October, as  employment fell.  However, the job- offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading 
indicator of employment, rose to an eleven -year high.  Nominal wages continued to fall 
through October.  Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo ar ea (which exclude fresh food but include 
energy) ticked down in November from the previous month and were down 0.3 percent from a year earlier.  In contrast, the headlin e rate of inflation was boosted to 0.7 percent 
by spikes in food prices following a series of  typhoons and an earthquake in October.  
Higher commodity prices helped to push whol esale prices up in Oc tober to a level 1.9 
percent above a year ag o, the largest twelve-m onth increase since 1990.

Euro-area  GDP grew 1.2 percent in the third quarter, down from  an average rate of 2.3 
percent in the first half of the year.  Final domestic dema nd contributed 1.6 percentage 
points to growth, as private consumption and especially investment continued to rise.  
The negative contribution from net exports was a sizable 2.6 percentage points, as 
imports outpaced exports.  The decline in net exports was roughly offset by a surge in inventories.  The economic slowdown was concentrated in the two largest member countries, France 
and Germany.  French GDP rose only 0.3 pe rcent in the third quarter, its weakest 
performance since the second quarter of  2003.  Final domestic demand fell as both 
private consumption and investment declined.  Without a sizable build in inventories, 
French GDP would have contracted 2.4 percent.   German GDP growth was also primarily 
attributable to inventory accumulation.  Fina l domestic demand grew 1.6 percent, while 
net exports made a sizable negative contribution.   
The few available indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continue d weakness.  Survey

area economic sentiment fell in November to  a four-month low.  Among the components 
of the sentiment index, confidence in the servic es sector dropped.  In contrast, confidence 
in both the consumer and construction sect ors edged up.  After moving up modestly in 
October, the German IFO survey resume d its downward trend in November.   
 Labor market conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate 
unchanged at 8.9 percent in October.  The German unemployment rate edged up in November for the second consecutive month.  The EC survey indicates that neither firms 
nor consumers expect the labor market to  improve over the ne xt twelve months. 
 Twelve-month consumer price inflation in  the euro area receded to 2.2 percent in 
November, after surging to 2.4 percent in Oc tober.  The ECB measure of twelve-month 
core inflation, excluding ener gy and unprocessed foods, dipped to 2.0 percent in October,

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 1.8 percent in the thir d quarter, up slightly from 
the preliminary estimate but down from gr owth rates earlier this year.  Private 
consumption continued to expand at a moderate pace, and government spending rose strongly.  These increases were partially offset  by the first dip in fixed investment since 
the first quarter of 2003 and a negative c ontribution to growth from inventories.

On balance, indicators for the fourth quarter  hint at a pick-up in  activity.  Industrial 
production in October continued to slide, bu t November’s manufacturing PMI continued 
to improve.  Although business confidence dippe d in November after a relatively strong 
reading in October, it has been especially volatile of late.  Both consumer confidence and 
the services PMI edged up furthe r in November.  Retail sales slipped in October, and the 
two leading surveys of retail sales for N ovember were mixed, with the two surveys 
pointing in opposite directions.  
Over the four months ending in Novemb er, housing price growth has been muted, 
according to an average of the two leading private indexes.  Household net mortgage 
borrowing eased in October, after several m onths of steeper declines, remaining near 
levels seen during the first half of 2003.

The labor market continued to be tight, as  the official-claims- based measure of the 
unemployment rate remained near its lowest  point since 1975, and the labor-force-survey 
IV-18 
measure hit an all-time low.  The twelve-mont h rate of consumer price inflation edged up 
to 1.2 percent in October, still well belo w the Bank of England’s 2 percent target. 
 On December 2, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown presented the government’s Pre-Budget Report to Parliament.  While Brown reported that Public Sector Net 
Borrowing (PSNB) in the fiscal year  2003-2004 was £1.5 billion less than the £37.5 
billion projected in March's budget, he rais ed the forecast for 2004-05 £1 billion to £34 
billion (2.9 percent of GDP) and upped the 2005-06 forecast £2 billion to £33 billion (2.7 
percent of GDP).  The government kept its real GDP growth for ecast for 2005 at 3-3.5 
percent. 
 
In Canada , real GDP growth moderated to 3.2 percent in the third quarter .  Growth was 
bolstered by strong advances in  the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors.  Final 
domestic demand growth firmed to 3.3 pe rcent, led by consumption and business 
investment.  In contrast, net exports declin ed sharply as imports surged for the second 
consecutive quarter and exports  fell.  The pullback in e xports was widespread, with 
energy and automotive products the main sources of weakness.  The negative contribution to GDP growth from net exports wa s largely offset by a surge in inventories, 
however.

Indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued m oderation of production.  The 
composite index of leading indicators rose agai n in October, its nint h monthly rise this 
year, but more gradually than the year-to-date  average.  The number of building permits 
IV-19 
issued in October increased for the first time in four months, due entirely to a gain in 
residential permits.  Consistent with this, hous ing starts rose in N ovember for the first 
time in four months, leaving hous ing starts so far in the four th quarter moderately below 
their strong third-quarter average.   The purchasing manager’s index also rose in 
November.  In November, total employment was virt ually unchanged, a disappointing outcome 
following two months of strong job gains.  The labor market has been quite volatile so far 
in the second half of the year, following a solid second quarter.  The unemployment rate 
moved up to 7.3 percent in November as  the labor force continued to expand.  
 In October, the twelve-month ra te of headline CPI inflation jumped to 2.3 percent, after 
registering just under 2 percen t the previous two months, as gasoline prices spiked up 
following four months of decline.  The twel ve-month rate of core inflation, excluding 
food, energy, and indirect taxes, however, inched below 1 per cent in October.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Real GDP growth moderated in the third quarter on average in Latin America and 
emerging Asia, despite a rebound in China.  More recent data releases have been mixed.  Consumer price inflation in many emerging market economies remains elevated relative 
to 2003 levels, partly due to higher oil prices.  
  The latest indicators for China  have been mixed but are generally consistent with some 
deceleration in the Chinese economy in the four th quarter.  Staff estimates indicate that 
investment contracted slightly in Oct ober, the third monthly contraction since 
administrative measures aimed at slowing invest ment were put in place in April.  Growth 
in industrial production and lendi ng were up a touch in October, but remained well below 
growth recorded before April’s tightening.  Among the indicators, imports appear to be 
the outlier.  After slowing fo r several months, imports of both final and intermediate 
goods rose sharply in October.  The rise in  imports swamped that of exports, shrinking 
the trade surplus, although it remains sizeable nonetheless.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation slowed significan tly in October to 4.3 percent, as the past year’s food price 
increases have started to unw ind.  Non-food prices edged up further to 1 percent above 
their year-earlier levels.

Real GDP in Hong Kong  grew at a surprisingly strong ra te of almost 8 percent in the 
third quarter.  Services exports led the way, rising at an annual rate of more than 
30 percent in the quarter.  Personal consum ption, which soared in the second quarter, 
contracted some in the third quarter, but rema ined well above its firs t-quarter level.  The 
unemployment rate fell slightly in October.   The merchandise trade deficit shrank in

Real GDP in Taiwan  grew 4.5 percent in the third qua rter, and second- quarter growth 
was revised upward from a small decline to ve ry modest growth.  Personal consumption 
rebounded in the third quarter, as consumer confidence returned w ith the resolution of 
uncertainty surrounding the Taiwanese presiden tial election.  Industrial production fell in 
October.  Production of high-tech goods has now fallen for three consecutive months, but 
new orders for these goods, which have been  sluggish, rose in October.  Taiwan 
registered trade deficits in October and November, as exports slumped and imports 
continued to rise.  Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in November fr om a year earlier.

Data for Korea  indicate that economic performance remains sluggish.  Real GDP rose 
2.6 percent in the third quarter, following an  equally lackluster second quarter, with 
declines in both consumption and investme nt and only a small increase in exports.  
Industrial production dropped near ly 1 percent in October, wi th losses concentrated in 
industries servicing domestic consumption.  The October trade surplus narrowed from its 
high September level, held down by rising impor ts of oil and travel-related services.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation dec lined to 3.3 percent in November, reflecting 
declines in agricultural prices .  Partly in respons e to the ongoing weakness, as well as to 
counter upward pressure on the currency, the Ba nk of Korea lowered its target interest 
rate for the second time since August.  Th e government is also discussing further 
stimulus measures.

In the ASEAN  region, third-quarter real GDP gr owth declined in Indonesia and 
Malaysia, became negative in Singapore, but was surprisingly strong in Thailand and the 
Philippines.  Monthly indicators and anecdotal evidence indicate that the adverse effects 
of high oil prices and less rapid expansion in global demand for high-tech products have 
weighed on activity in parts of the region.  October i ndustrial producti on declined 
1.2 percent in Malaysia, and was flat in Th ailand.  In Singapore, however, the volatile 
industrial production index rose sharply in Oc tober after declines in the previous two 
months, and the October PMI was up.  Indonesi a, Malaysia, and Si ngapore continued to 
record sizeable trade surpluses.   Across the region, consumer price inflation continues to remain elevated relative to rates 
during 2003, likely due to the effects of the hi gher world and domestic prices of fuel.  
Although governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand subsidize domestic energy 
prices to varying extents, the Malaysian a nd Thai governments have lately allowed some 
increases in domestic prices of fuels.

In Mexico , GDP growth slowed to a 2.6 percent pace in the third quarter, about half that 
in the previous three quarters.  The impetus for growth has shifted somewhat, with U.S. 
demand for Mexican products moderating and Mexican domestic demand remaining 
robust.  Following rapid first- half growth, manufacturing expo rts stagnated in the third 
quarter and declined in October to their lowest level since Janua ry.  In contrast, indicators 
of consumption and investment spending have remained strong.  Retail sales rose at an 
11 percent annual rate in the third quarter, and construction activity was robust.  In 
addition, high oil revenues have financed  increased government spending, providing a 
significant stimulus to the economy.  The Bank of Mexico tightened policy for th e eighth time this year on November 26, 
saying that it aimed to prevent this year’s rise in inflation from feeding into higher 
inflation expectations and wage increases.  The 28-day CETES rate has risen 240 basis 
points on net since end-2003 to 8.3 percent.  The Mexican Congress in mid-November 
approved a budget bill for 2005 with  a deficit target of 0.2 percent of GDP, only slightly 
lower than the 2004 target, de spite the higher oil price assumption built into the budget.

In Brazil , real GDP growth slowed to 4.2 per cent in the third quarter, while second 
quarter growth was revised down to 5.5 per cent.  Third-quarter growth was led by a 
12 percent rise (annual ra te) in industrial out put.  On the demand side, investment grew 
30 percent, the most rapid rate in ten year s, while private cons umption continued to 
exhibit robust growth.  In contrast to the prev ious two quarters, the external sector made a 
negative arithmetic contribution to growth, as real import grow th rose sharply while real 
export growth declined.  Monthly indicator s have given hints that economic activity 
slowed further more recently.  Industrial output  growth paused in September, and vehicle 
production and sales declined in October.  Brazil continued to post sizeable trade 
surpluses and is on track for a record trade surplus for the year.  Inflation rose in October, pre ssured by hikes in domestic prices of fuel, raising twelve-
month inflation to nearly 7 pe rcent.  Concern over the effect s of rises in fuel prices on 
inflation and inflation expecta tions prompted the central bank in mid-November to raise 
its policy rate another 50 basis points to 17.25 percent.  The increase was the third in 
three months and brought the cumulative rate hike since September to 125 basis points.  
Given the overall good economic and fiscal perf ormance over the past year, officials have 
indicated that Brazil will probably not rene w its IMF program when it expires in March 
2005.

In Argentina , the economic recovery appears to ha ve continued in the third quarter.  
Industrial production grew 2 percen t in the third quarter, after contracting in the previous 
quarter.  However, October i ndustrial production was flat.  Th e trade surplus was nearly 
$14 billion in October; nominal exports this year have b een supported by higher 
commodities prices.  Twelve-month consumer pr ice inflation has risen in recent months 
and was 5.5 percent for November. 
 
In late November, the bank managing the Argentine government’s proposed bond 
exchange in the United States withdrew from  the deal, and Italian regulators delayed the 
launch of the debt exchange in Italy until at l east mid-December.  In light of these events, 
the Argentine government rescheduled the la unch date from late November to mid-
January.  Also in late November, the Ar gentine Congress approved the government's 
budget for 2005.  The budget aims for a federal primary surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP and a consolidated primary surplus of 3.6 pe rcent, below the 4 percent that has been 
demanded by the IMF.

In Venezuela , real GDP declined nearly 1 percent in the third quarter according to staff 
estimates, after soaring in the previous two quarters.  On December 3, Finance Minister 
Tobias Nobrega announced that the bolivar  would be devalued nearly 11 percent 
effective January 1, but retracted that stat ement later in the day.  Two days later, 
President Chavez replaced Nobrega with Nelson Merentes.  Capital controls are expected 
to limit speculative behavior  that would otherwise erode  central bank international 
reserves, which stand at $23 billion.  The bo livar was pegged to th e dollar in early 2003 
in a bid to reduce inflation.  Inflation has since fallen, but remains high, nearly 20 percent 
for the twelve months through November.  O il production is still estimated to be below 
the level prevailing before the national strikes of 2002.

In Russia , data releases were mixed.  In Oc tober, although industrial production and 
construction continued to contract, there we re hints of improvement in business fixed 
investment.  The trade surplus widened furthe r in September.  Consumer price inflation 
continued to rise in November , reflecting higher food prices.  
 The tax dispute between the Russian govern ment and the Russian oil company Yukos 
intensified in recent weeks, as authorities  raised their tax cl aims on Yukos to around 
$25 billion and set the auc tion of Yuganskneftegaz,
 Yukos’ main production facility, for 
December 19, and as top company officials fled Russia.  Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly in Russia with close tie s to the government, is widely  expected to bid for the 
facility.  To forestall future government intervention in remaining Yukos assets, an 
extraordinary shareholders’ meeting will be  held on December 20 to consider whether 
Yukos should be put into formal bankruptcy  proceedings and possibly even liquidated. 
Yukos currently produces 1.75 million b/d of  oil (Yuganskneftegaz produces 1 million 
b/d), and analysts are concerne d that production could decline in  the near future due to a 
lack of funds for maintenance.
