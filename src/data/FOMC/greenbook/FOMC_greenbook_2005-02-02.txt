Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Overview 
The economy appears to have expanded at a solid pace in the fi nal quarter of 2004.  
Household spending rose at a brisk pace, and residential construction activity remained at a high level.  Growth of demand in the business sector was strong as well:  Outlays 
for equipment and software posted another robust increase, and inventory accumulation 
appears to have been rapid.  The industrial sector registered broa d-based increases in 
production.  At the same time, private payrol ls have expanded at a moderate rate, and 
slack in the labor market appears to be dissi pating only slowly.  Core consumer prices 
have increased at a steady but modest pace in  recent months.  The overall CPI, however, 
has been buffeted by sizable movements in energy prices.  
Labor Market Developments 
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 181,00 0 per month, on average, in the fourth 
quarter, a significant step-up from 93,000 in the third quarter and on par with average 
monthly increases for 2004 as a whole.  B oosted by these employment gains, aggregate 
hours of production or nonsupervisory work ers increased at an  annual rate of 
2.1 percent last quarter.  Meanwhile, measur es of labor market slack were little 
changed.    In December, private nonfarm payrolls rose 128,000, a gain similar to November’s.  By industry, manufacturing employment edge d up 3,000 last month, and the related 
industries of wholesale trade (17,000) and te mporary help services (9,000) added jobs 
as well.  Seasonally adjusted employment fe ll in retail trade (-20,000), as holiday hiring 
was below the seasonal norm.  But job gains elsewhere in the serv ices-producing sector 
were widespread, with solid advances in he alth care services (36,000), professional and 
technical services (29,000), and financial activities (14,000).  Average weekly hours of 
production or nonsupervisory workers bounced back 0.1 hour last month to their October level of 33.8 hours.    In the household survey, the unemployment rate  held steady at 5.4 percent in December, 
and the labor force participation rate ticke d down to 66.0 percent after having increased 
in October and November.
1  The employment-population ratio, which combines these 
two measures, was 62.4 percent in December, equa l to its third-quarter  average and still  
                                                 
1 With December’s employment report, the BLS revise d seasonal factors for labor force series going 
back to January 2000.  The resulting revisions to the unemployment rate and the labor force participation 
rate were small.

only a bit above the lows reached in the middle of 2003.  Mirroring this pattern, the 
percent of employed individuals working part -time for economic reasons (an alternative 
indicator of labor market slack) has only edged down from its 2003 highs. 
  Other labor market indicators point to con tinued moderate gains in employment early 
this year.  The four-week moving average of  initial claims for unemployment insurance 
was 341,000 for the week ending January 15 and has fluctuated within a narrow range 
centered on 340,000 since last spring.  Acco rding to the Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover Survey, the rate of hires in the pr ivate sector jumped in November to its 
highest level since January 2001, and, despit e moving down in November, the rate of 
job openings remained above the average level seen in the first half of 2004.  
Employers’ net hiring plans are approaching pre-recession peaks, according to indexes 
from both Manpower Inc. and the Nationa l Federation of Independent Businesses 
(NFIB).  Although individuals’ expectations of future labor mark et conditions as 
gauged by the Conference Board and the Michig an Survey have changed little, on net, 
over the past year, they remain well above their cyclical lows.   Recent surveys also show that, to date, firm s and workers have noticed only a moderate 
amount of tightening in the labor market.  Although the share of small businesses 
finding positions to be hard to fill ticked up last month according to the NFIB, it has increased only modestly from the low point  reached in 2003 and remains below levels 
prevailing in the mid-1990s. The view from the opposite end of the labor market is 
similar, according to the Conference Board, as  individuals believe that jobs are still 
relatively difficult to find.    
Industrial Production 
The pace of expansion in the industrial sector  picked up in the fourth quarter, and gains 
were broadly based across industries.  Total IP  rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, a 
step-up from the more subdued third-quarter rate and just a bit less than the average 
quarterly increase for 2004.  Manufacturing outpu t also rose at a 4.1 percent rate in the 
fourth quarter—which was about the same pace as that of the previous quarter, and the 
5 percent increase for th e year as a whole was the larges t increase since 1999.  Output at 
mines declined in the fourth quarter, larg ely the result of a dr op in natural gas 
extraction, while utilities output rose at a rapid clip.  The ra te of capacity utilization

 Overall, the production of high- tech goods rose at an annua l rate of 14 percent in the 
fourth quarter, a pace somewhat slower than that seen earlier in the year.  
Semiconductor manufacturers posted strong ga ins in December.  Moreover, stronger-
than-expected sales in the four th quarter have helped Intel eliminate much of its excess 
inventories, and the company’s strong earni ngs forecast for the first quarter, coupled 
with its plans to press ahead with the rele ase of next-generation chips for both laptops 
and high-end servers, suggests so lid gains in real semiconducto r output in the near term.  
The production of computers also moved up respectably in December, and output of communications equipment edged up follo wing larger increases in October and 
November.    Forward-looking indicators of activity for the high-tech indus tries are mostly consistent 
with moderate production gain s in coming months.  Industr y contacts were notably 
optimistic about the outlook for servers, and they cited several f actors that suggest 
sustained production increases in 2005, in cluding a shift in demand toward  
more-expensive models, the arrival of new high-end products from IBM, and the onset 
of a server-replacement cycle.  Reinforcing th is outlook, Gartner reported that PC sales 
rose in the fourth quarter.  CIO Magazine  diffusion indexes for future spending on 
computer hardware and on networking equipment edged down in December for the second consecutive month, but the levels of these indexes remain elevated. 
 
In transportation equipment, motor vehicle assemblies rose 200,000 units in the fourth 
quarter of 2004 to an annual rate of 12.0 m illion units; the increase contributed to a 
jump of 14½ percent in the out put of motor vehicles and part s.  Over the four quarters 
of 2004, motor vehicles and parts rose 2½ percen t.  The output of m ilitary aircraft and  
                                                
 
2 In the annual revision of industrial production, cap acity, and capacity utilization that was published in 
December, the rate of capacity utilization was revised up  nearly 1 percentage point in recent quarters.  The 
higher utilization rates were concentrated among el ectric and gas utilities, mining, and high-technology 
industries.  Overall changes to total IP were small; the rise in output in 2002 is now shown to have been slightly stronger than previously reported, and the increases in 2003 and 2004 are somewhat smaller.  Recent production increases for high-technology industri es are now estimated to have been lower than 
previously estimated.

equipment, which continued to climb briskly, was up more than 12 percent in 2004.  In 
contrast, commercial aircraft production was up only slightly from its year-ago level. 
 Excluding high-tech, transportation, and ener gy, production of business equipment rose 
noticeably less in the fourth quarter than it did in the third, as the production of 
industrial and other equipment flattened after sharp increas es earlier in the year.  
Production of both construction and business su pplies as well as of materials also 
decelerated somewhat in the fourth quarter.   In contrast, production of consumer goods 
accelerated a bit—though to a still-moderate rate—with most of th e greater strength in 
the production of durables.    Most of the forward-looking indicators of pr oduction, as well as reports from the staff’s 
industry contacts, suggest that activity in the industrial sector will expand at a moderate 
pace in coming months.  For example, the IS M diffusion index of new orders moved up 
in December.  The various regional diffusi on indexes of new orders, some of which 
now extend through January, moved down but were  still at levels s uggestive of further 
gains in production.  Finally, the limited w eekly data we have in hand suggest that 
manufacturing IP will increase moderately in January.   In the ISM’s Semiannual Economic forecast that was released in December, the number of manufacturing purchasing ma nagers indicating that their companies plan to increase 
capital expenditures in 2005 exceeded the num ber indicating a pla nned decrease.  If 
historical norms hold true, this diffu sion index—coupled with the still-low 
manufacturing operating rate of 77.8 percen t in December—would be consistent with 
an increase in nominal capital spending by manufacturers in 2005 of  about 5½ percent, 
a shade higher than the forecast for 2 004.  As a result, we now estimate that 
manufacturing capacity in 2005 will increase ar ound 1½ percent, a rate slightly faster 
than the 1¼ percent pace seen in 2004. 
 
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of light vehicles surged 2 million un its in December to an annual rate of 18.3 
million units, the highest monthly sales rate since October 2001.  For the fourth quarter 
as a whole, light-vehicle sales were up about 100,000 units.  The December jump in 
sales occurred even though the average valu e of incentives dec lined for a fourth 
consecutive month; indeed, from Septembe r through December, the average value fell 
more than $450.  According to industry reports, sales were boosted by a pickup in 
advertising and other inducements that do not  show up in our incen tive series.  Also,

much of the decline in the average value of incentives appears to reflect a shift in sales 
from more heavily discounted 2004 model-y ear vehicles to new 2005 models, rather 
than reductions in effective pr ices on individual vehicles.3   
 Over the first half of Janua ry, the overall average value of incentives per vehicle has 
changed little:  Incentives on 2005 models have  increased, but with lower inventories of 
2004 models, incentives have been cut back for these vehicles.
 4  The Michigan SRC 
index of car-buying attitudes dipped in early Janu ary, in part a result of less-favorable 
views on interest rates.  In December, total motor vehicle production was 12.1 million units (annual rate), up from a rate of 11.9 million units in November.  Despite the surge in sales in December 
and the modest increase in  production last month, inventories held by domestic 
producers remained high through year-end, especi ally for light trucks.  Days’ supply of 
total light vehicles last quarter was about unchanged from the third-quarter level and 
stood at about 73 days.  Nevert heless, manufacturers’ asse mbly plans for January call 
for a further step-up in total motor vehicl e production to a pace of 12.5 million units.   
                                                
 
3Seasonal adjustment is able to mitigate only a small part of this mix shift b ecause of irregularities in 
the series’ seasonal pattern. 
4 Incentives on 2004 models still remained above those on 2005 models over the first half of January.

For the first quarter as a w hole, production schedules ar e at an annual rate of 12.4 
million units.        
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending expanded briskly last quarter, supported by rising wealth, solid 
increases in income, and an upbeat mood am ong consumers.  In the retail control 
category of goods—which excludes auto de alers and building material and supply 
stores—nominal spending increased 0.3 pe rcent in December after having risen 
0.4 percent in November.  Factoring in the re levant measure of prices, which declined 
in both November and December as gasoline prices dropped, we estimate that real spending in the control category advanced at a rapid clip at the end of the year—enough 
to bring the quarterly increase in real PCE for goods excluding moto r vehicles and parts 
to an estimated 4¾ percent.  Real outlays  on consumer services rose 0.3 percent in 
November, close to the strong gains posted in September and October. 
 Real disposable personal income moved up at an average annual rate of about 
2½ percent in the first three qua rters of the year and conti nued that pace of advance in 
October and November.  (Although complete income data for December are not yet 
available, wages and salaries apparently  posted a moderate increase last month.
5)  Still, 
the increase in consumer spending outstri pped income gains through November, and the 
personal saving rate slid to ¼ percent, down ¼ percentage point from the third quarter 
and a full percentage point from a year earl ier.  Meanwhile, the ratio of household net 
wealth to income was boosted significantly last year by increasing housing and equity 
values.    According to surveys by both the Michigan SRC and the Conference Board, consumer sentiment remained favorable in January.  The levels of both indexes are consistent with 
continuing solid gains in consum er spending early this year. 
 
Housing Markets 
Starts of single-family homes rebounded in December to an annual rate of 1.68 million 
units, an increase that more than reversed a sharp decline in Novemb er.  For the fourth  
                                                
 
5 The BEA’s advance estimate of the increase in r eal disposable income in December, which will be 
published next week, is likely to be boosted 3.3 percentage points (on a monthly, not annual, basis) by Microsoft’s dividend payout.  Howe ver, the accompanying decline in th e company’s stock price seems to 
have had a largely offsetting effect on household financial resources.  Thus, the net effect on personal 
consumption should be small.

quarter as a whole, single-family starts averaged 1.61 million units, about the same as 
the average during the first three quarters of the year.  Moreover, because the backlog of 
permits for single-family homes remained high in December, starts likely have 
remained at a high level in January.6  Multifamily starts in December came in at an 
annual rate of 326,000 units, about the same as  in November.  The average reading in 
those two months was about 7 percent lowe r than the average during the first ten 
months of 2004.  However, the rise in the backlog of permits fo r multifamily homes in 
both November and December points to  a rebound in starts in January. 
  The most recent data on home sales weakened  some.  Sales of existing homes slipped 
3¼ percent in December to an annual rate of 6.69 million units; still, this sales pace was 
slightly more than the average pace duri ng the January-November period.  New home 
sales fell 12 percent in November (the most recent observation) to an annual rate of 1.13 
million units, about 6 percent lower than the average pace during the first ten months of 
2004.  However, key indicators of demand have  remained favorable .  The thirty-year 
fixed-rate mortgage rate ha s changed little, on balance, since August, averaging about 
5¾ percent.  Similarly, the one -year adjustable mortgage ra te has changed little since 
last May, averaging about 4.1 percent over th at period.  The four-week moving average 
of the Mortgage Bankers Association index of  mortgage applications for home purchase 
has declined during the past few weeks, and the most recent reading is near the low end 
of the range seen during the past year.  The Michigan Survey’s index of homebuying 
sentiment in December and early January was so mewhat higher than the levels seen last 
fall.       Home prices have continued to rise rapidl y.  The average price of existing homes was 
up 8.2 percent in December from a year earl ier.  The twelve-month change in the 
average price of new homes has fluctuated wi dely of late, but the average for October 
and November (the most recent observations ) was about 8 percent higher than in the 
same period in the previous year.
7  The repeat-transactions price index for existing 
homes, which measures the value of the same  units over time, rose 13 percent in the  
                                                 
6 By definition, the change in the backlog equals permits minus starts minus permit cancellations.  The 
level of permits—after adjusting for activity in areas  where permits are not required—was lower than the 
level of starts last month; in itself, this figur e pulled down the permit backlog.  However, permit 
cancellations in December were negative, which booste d the backlog.  Negative cancellations may result 
from errors in the data.  
7 The twelve-month change in the average price of  new homes was 16½ percent in October and close 
to zero in November.

third quarter from a year earlier.8  The constant-quality price index for new homes—
which controls for changes in the geographi c composition of sales, home size, and a few 
other readily measurable attr ibutes—was up 6¼ percent in th e third quarter from a year 
earlier.    
Equipment and Software 
Business outlays for equipment and software look  to have increased at a solid pace last 
quarter, though not as briskly as the 18 per cent (annual rate) gain re corded in the third 
quarter.  It appears that stronger growth in business purchases of high-tech gear in the 
fourth quarter was more than offset by a significant deceleration in spending on 
transportation and other equipment.  Neve rtheless, underlying fundamentals remain 
consistent with robust growth in investme nt demand:  Business output continues to 
expand, firms remain flush with cash, and a lthough the partial-expe nsing tax provision 
has now expired, the cost of capital remains fa vorable because of low interest rates.  
Furthermore, anecdotal reports, business surv eys, and our business contacts offer an 
optimistic reading on near-term capital spending plans.  In the high-tech sector, nominal shipment s of computing equipment dropped 4 percent 
in November (not at an annual rate), but this decline reversed only a fraction of the 
sizable gain posted in the previous mont h, and orders for computers moved up in 
November.  Coupled with ongoing steep declines  in computer prices, real outlays for 
computing equipment are poised for an appr eciable increase in the fourth quarter.  
Shipments of communications equipment, whic h have been inching up since last spring, 
increased further in November, and the backlog of orders fell.  Coupl ed with higher net 
imports of communications gear through Nove mber and falling prices, the latest data 
suggest that real spending on communications equipment also  increased modestly in the 
fourth quarter.   Business spending on light motor vehicles likel y fell in the fourth quarter despite an 
estimated uptick in December.
9  In contrast, sales of medi um and heavy trucks rose in 
the fourth quarter, and purchases in Decembe r were up more than 14 percent.  Orders  
                                                 
8 A version of the index that excludes the appraised values of refinanced properties—which are not 
sales prices—was up 10 percent in the third quarter  from a year earlier and shows a smoother acceleration 
in recent years. 
9 Staff estimates suggest that light-vehicle fleet sales to businesses jumped ½ million units at an annual 
rate in December.  The BEA splits light-vehicle sales between businesse s and consumers on the basis of 
data on vehicle registrations, which it obtains from R.L.  Polk with a lag.  Thus, at this juncture, it is 
impossible to determine for certain the strength of business light-vehicle demand in December.

for heavy (class 8) trucks have been partic ularly strong.  Backlogs for these vehicles 
climbed steadily throughout 2004 and in December were at their highest level since late 1999.  Business purchases of aircraft likely incr eased moderately in the fourth quarter.  
Smoothing through the lumpiness in the m onthly data, shipments of aircraft by 
domestic producers in October and November  were about unchanged from the previous 
quarter, but imports of jets strengthened.  Outside of high-tech and transportation, no minal shipments of nondefense capital goods 
fell in November, retracing the gains posted in September and October.  Orders in this 
category ticked up after having seesawed in the preceding two months.  As noted in previous Greenbooks, the partial-expensing tax provision provided an especially strong 
incentive to purchase the types of equipmen t included in this category because such 
equipment is treated as deprec iating slowly.  We had originally expected investment in 
this sector to surge most dramatically just before y ear-end, but the available data 
suggest that the surge may have occurred so mewhat earlier.  However, distinguishing 
the effect of the tax provision from the in fluence of other fact ors and the inherent 
volatility in the data is quite difficult.  
Nonresidential Construction 
Real outlays for nonresidentia l structures have edged down, on balance, in recent 
months.  Spending on commercial  structures posted robust ga ins through August of last 
year but has slipped since then.  Real constr uction of office buildings  has been declining 
since last spring, and the vacancy rate, although down some recently, remains high.  
Real construction of manufacturing structures  has been essentially flat—at a very low 
level—since the latter part of  2002, and the recent data show  no evidence of an upturn.  
Investment in drilling and mi ning structures trended up thro ugh the first three quarters 
of last year in response to higher prices fo r natural gas, and the further rise in the 
number of rigs drilling for natural gas thr ough year-end points to another increase in 
this sector’s investment in the fourth quarter.   
 
Business Inventories 
The book value of manufacturing and trade inve ntories excluding motor vehicles surged 
in October and November.  Given the observe d changes in prices, these data imply a 
sizable contribution from real non-auto inve ntory investment to the fourth-quarter 
increase in real GDP.  I nventory accumulation was wide spread among manufacturers, 
wholesalers, and retailers, as well as acro ss stages of production.  Inventory-sales ratios 
have been about flat since the middle of last  year after having fallen considerably over

the previous three years.  But even with th e recent spurt of stockbuilding, the fraction of 
purchasing managers in the ISM survey who viewed customers’ i nventories as too high 
in December was only a bit above the third- quarter reading and well below the fraction 
who viewed those inventories as too low.  Data from the staff’s flow-of- goods inventory system indicate that inventories fell back 
in December after having moved up in the previous two months.  Inventories are 
estimated to have remained elevated re lative to consumption for a few products, 
including motor vehicles, semiconductors, pa per, leather and allied products, and 
chemicals excluding pharmaceuticals.  None theless, the aggregate days’ supply of 
inventories continued to edge down in December. 
 
Federal Government Sector  
Recent data point to some improvement in  the budget outlook.  According to the 
Monthly Treasury Statement, the federal gov ernment recorded a $3 billion deficit in 
December, down considerably from the $18 billion deficit posted in December 2003. 
The budget deficit over the twelve months  ending in December was $401 billion, 
similar to the level recorded over the comp arable period a year earlier but below the 
levels recorded last spring.  Although outlays have been increasing strongly, receipts have been rising even more 
rapidly.  Receipts in December jumped 15½ percent above the level posted a year 
earlier:  Corporate income tax collections surged, and individual income and payroll 
taxes rose despite the damping effects of last year =s tax cuts.   
 Outlays, adjusted for financial transactions  and payment timing shifts, rose 7½ percent 
in December over year-earlier levels, similar to the pace seen over the past two years.  
Defense spending was 10 percent higher in Dece mber than a year ago, while growth in 
Medicare and Medicaid last year was subdue d.  Other spending has been relatively 
strong over the past few months, with larg e increases posted in education grants, 
disaster relief, and international affairs.  CBO’s just-released Economic and Budget Ou tlook report shows a ba seline deficit for 
fiscal 2005 of $368 billion, falling to $295 billio n in fiscal 2006.  Because of scoring 
conventions, these baseline figures exclude th e budget effects of future appropriations 
for the war in Iraq and future extensions of  expiring tax provisions.  CBO estimates that 
the budget deficit including these programs w ould be nearly $400 billion in both fiscal

2005 and 2006, essentially the same as the $412 b illion deficit recorded in fiscal 2004.  
Both the baseline and adjusted baseline deficits improve over the 2007-2015 period as 
outlays are projected to declin e as a share of GDP over time. 
 
State and Local Governments 
Spending by state and local governments appear s to be rising.  Employment in this 
sector has now increased for six consecutive  months, and the quarterly gains during the 
second half of 2004 were the la rgest since the end of 2001.  While much of the recent 
strength has been at educati onal establishments, steady incr eases were reported outside 
of education as well.  Following a large dr op in August, state and local outlays for 
construction rose steadily through November to  bring the level of spending back near 
the elevated range seen  earlier last year. 
 Most legislatures reconven e in January, and governors ar e making their state-of-the-
state speeches and introducing budget proposals for fiscal 2006 (which begins July 1 for 
all but four states).  Revenue growth has strengthened over the past year in most states.  
However, even with tax bases expected to re main strong, some states  will still have to 
deal with lingering fiscal diffi culties, such as depleted re serve funds, the expiration of 
temporary tax hikes, and rising Medicaid costs.  In addition, with anti-tax sentiment still 
strong, legislatures are unlikely to enact significant tax increas e during the upcoming 
legislative cycle.  A number of key states  still have severely  strained budgetary 
situations.  One example is California, wh ere the governor conti nues to promise that 
taxes will not be raised; the state is likely once again to borrow in financial markets and 
to restrain some spending programs.  Mean while, the situation in New York is not as 
grim as once expected:  A $1 billion surp lus is now being forecast for fiscal 2005, 
which ends March 31 for that state, and receipts  in fiscal 2006 are expected to be higher 
than previously thought.    
Prices 
The overall consumer price index declin ed 0.1 percent in December—following a 
0.2 percent increase in November—as consumer prices for oil products fell and prices 
for food held steady.  Over the twelve mont hs ending in December, the CPI increased 
3.3 percent, up nearly 1½ percen tage points from the year-earli er period.  About half of 
the past year’s CPI acceleration was the direct  result of a sharp increase in consumer 
energy prices, but core consumer price inflat ion also picked up 1 percentage point.   
 
Following October’s sharp increase, the CPI for energy edged up only a bit in

November and fell 1.8 percent in December.  Consumer prices of motor fuel fell 
markedly last month, as spot prices for crude oil declined ab out $5 per barrel in 
December and plentiful inventories restrained  markups of retail gasoline prices over 
crude oil costs.  Retail gaso line prices continued to d ecline through mid-January in 
response to December’s drop in crude oil costs.   However, with crude oil prices moving 
back up in January, retail gasoline prices  began to rise again around mid-month.  The 
CPI for natural gas moved up somewhat furt her in December after November’s large 
increase despite an ample level of inventories.  Consumer food prices increased 0.2 per cent in November and were unchanged in 
December.  The deceleration in December refl ected a decline in the CPI for fresh fruits 
and vegetables following the earlier massive  price increases caused by the hurricane 
damage to crops in Florida.  Over the tw elve months ending in December, overall food 
prices rose 2.7 percent, n early 1 percentage point less than over the preceding year. 
 Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 per cent in both November and December.  
The twelve-month change in core consumer  prices was 2.2 percent in December, up 
from the extraordinarily low 1.1 percent rate posted in Dece mber 2003.  The increase in 
core consumer price inflation over the past  year was concentrated in goods prices, 
which moved up 0.6 percent in 2004 after dropping 2½ percent in 2003 and 1½ percent 
in 2002.  Although much of the pickup in core  goods inflation occurred as higher costs 
for imports, energy, and core intermediate ma terials were passed through to consumer 
goods prices, some of the pickup appears to refl ect transitory factors that are not readily 
explainable:  In particular, prices of new and especially used mo tor vehicles accelerated 
last year after their plunge in 2003.  In contrast , core services prices  rose 2.8 percent in 
2004, up just ¼ percentage point from the rate  posted in 2003 and noticeably lower than 
the increases in the three previous years.     The core PCE price index has accelerated by mu ch less than the core CPI over the past 
year.  In particular, core PCE prices increased 1½ per cent over the twelve months 
ending in November (the last availabl e observation), an acceleration of only 
¼ percentage point from the preceding year.    The difference in the acceleration in the co re CPI and the core PCE price index stems 
from several factors.  Medical services pric es accounted for much of the difference. In 
November, the twelve-month change in th e CPI for medical services was about 
1 percentage point higher th an the year-earlier increase;  in contrast, PCE medical

services decelerated nearly 1 percentage point over this period.  So me of this divergence 
likely reflects the narrower scope of CPI medical services:  PCE medical services 
include some components (for example, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and 
non-market prices) that ar e not covered in the CPI.10  In addition, the PCE medical 
services prices are mostly derived from s ource data other the CPIs—in particular, the 
PCE medical services prices depend h eavily on the producer price indexes. 
 Another part of the differential acceleration in the core CPI and core PCE price index 
arises from the inclusion of non-market prices  (other than those in  medical services) in 
the PCE price index.  In particular, the non-market category for imputed financial 
service charges declined sharply over the twelve months ending in November after 
having changed little over the preceding twelve-month pe riod.  Excluding all non-
market-based components, the core PCE pri ce index moved more closely in line with 
the core CPI (accelerating ¾ percentage point  to a 1.7 percent increase over the twelve 
months ending in November).    According to this month’s preliminary release of the Michigan Survey, median expectations for inflation over the coming year edged down to 2.9 percent in early 
January.  Median expectations for infla tion over the next five to ten years—at 
2.8 percent—were unchanged and remained w ithin the narrow range reported over the 
past several years.  The PPI for capital equipment edged up 0.1 percent in December, the smallest monthly increase since July.  Over the twelve mont hs ending in December, however, prices of 
capital equipment rose 2½ percent, compared  with an increase of only ¾ percent over 
2003 and a decline in 2002.   The PPI for core intermediate materials rose 0.5 percent in December, following slightly smaller increases in October and November.  Although these figures are down 
from the outsized increases in the first thr ee quarters, core intermediate prices stood 
8¼ percent above their year-ear lier level in December, compar ed with a 2 percent rise 
over the twelve months of 2003.  The pickup in these prices reflects rising capacity 
utilization, higher prices for imported indus trial materials, a nd the continued pass-
through of the earlier incr eases in energy prices. 
                                                
 
10 Because of this difference in scop e, medical care has a much larger weight in the PCE index than in 
the CPI.

Prices of core crude materials fell 1.7 percent in December, on the heels of large 
increases in October and November.  Decembe r’s drop in crude materials prices partly 
owed to a sharp decline in the index for iron and steel scrap.  Spot prices of steel scrap 
continued to decline through late January, although at a somewhat more modest pace.  
Since the December Greenbook, the Journal of  Commerce metals index has declined 
1¼ percent.  Over the same period, the CRB spot industrials index (which excludes 
energy) has declined 1 percent, and the JO C industrial index (which includes energy 
products) also has declined about 1 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
The market’s anticipated path for the federa l funds rate shifted up over the intermeeting 
period, prompted by the December FOMC mi nutes—which suggested greater-than-
expected concern about infl ation on the part of policymakers—and by economic data 
releases and statements by Federal Reserve offi cials that were viewed  as consistent with 
continued gradual policy tightening.  Short-  and intermediate-term Treasury yields 
moved up in line with the revision to po licy expectations, but yields on 10-year 
Treasuries were about unchanged.  Stock prices declined ov er the intermeeting period 
against the backdrop of increases in oil pr ices, lackluster earn ings reports, and 
expectations of more-rapid pol icy tightening.  Indicators of  corporate credit quality 
continued to be strong, and cor porate risk spreads stayed quite  narrow.  As of late last 
year, borrowing by households remained r obust and that of businesses quickened. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision at the December FOMC meeting to  hike the funds rate target 25 basis points 
was largely anticipated, and the response in financial markets that day was limited.  
However, market participants reportedly read the minutes of the December meeting, 
released on January 4, as expressing more  widespread concern among FOMC members 
about inflation risks than had previously been anticipated.  This rein terpretation led to an 
upward revision in the anticipated pace of m onetary policy tightening.  Incoming data on 
economic activity, on balance, did not dent these expectations of firmer  monetary policy.  
Interest rate futures contracts almost fully price in an increase of  25 basis points in the 
target rate at the upcoming FOMC meeti ng and place very high odds on quarter-point 
hikes at each of the two subsequent meetings.  The expected federal funds rate at the end 
of this year rose about 20 basis points, to  3.4 percent, consistent  with quarter-point 
firmings at half of the FOMC meetings over the year.  Uncertainty about the future path 
of policy, judging from implied volatilities on Eurodollars and swaps, has edged down. 
 
Consistent with these revisions to short-te rm policy expectations, the yield on two-year 
Treasury securities rose about ¼ percentage  point over the intermeeting period, with the 
largest daily move coming on the heels of the release of the mi nutes.  In contrast, the ten-
year Treasury yield was little changed, on net, implying that longer-horizon one-year 
forward rates declined.  A la rge portion of the drop in fo rward rates was apparently 
attributable to decreases in real rates,  as inflation compensation—measured by the 
difference between the yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities and 
adjusted for the effect of the TIPS indexa tion lag—was about unchanged, on net, at both 
the five-year and five-year-ahead horizons.  Longer-term yields may have been held

down by several factors, including some reducti on in market participants’ expectations of 
longer-run economic growth, owing to higher oil futures prices; a decline in term 
premiums that may have stemmed from subdue d interest rate volat ility; and speculation 
about foreign official purchases of Treas uries prompted by the dollar’s depreciation 
against some Asian currencies.   
 
Corporate Rates and Spreads 
Yields on corporate bonds moved roughly in line with those on comparable-maturity 
Treasuries over the intermeeting period, leav ing spreads near the bottom end of their 
range over the past fifteen years.  These spre ads are at about the same levels as in 1995 
and 1996, a period—similar to th e current one—that followed a sharp improvement in 
corporate credit quality and prof itability.  The yield spread between thirty-day A2/P2 and 
A1/P1 commercial paper, which rose in la te December on year-end pressures and light 
trading, has since reversed  some of its decline. 
 
Stock Prices, Earnings, and Credit Quality 
Broad stock price indexes we re down 2½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
with steeper declines recorded for the shar es of technology companies and small firms.  
Share prices, which had continued to climb after the December FOMC  meeting, fell on 
net in early January because of increases in  oil prices and expect ations of more-rapid 
monetary policy tightening.  Shar e prices slid further on the in itial wave of fourth-quarter 
earnings reports and the accompanying cautious  guidance provided by some firms that 
left investors somewhat disappointed.  With stock prices lower, the forward earnings-
price ratio ticked higher over the period.  Th e gap between the earnings-price ratio and 
the long-run real Treasury yield is now at about its average leve l over the past two 
decades.  Actual and implied volatiliti es on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 
remained near their ten-year lows. 
 With reports from about 150 companies in the S&P 500 now in hand, and on the basis of 
analysts’ latest estimates for the rest, ear nings per share in the fourth quarter are 
estimated to have increased about 16 percen t from a year earlier,  down from the even 
larger four-quarter gains experi enced in the first half of the year.  Reflecting the softer 
earnings outlook contained in fourth-quarter re ports, analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead 
earnings for S&P 500 firms were marked down in mid-January, a divergence from the 
recent pattern.

Measures of business credit qua lity continue to show that nonfinancial firms are in good 
shape.  These firms retain hefty cash reserves, according to balance sheet data for the 
third quarter.  Although the value of bond dow ngrades rose in the fourth quarter and 
swamped the value of upgrades, about half of  the value of the downgrades resulted from 
idiosyncratic factors related to two mergers rather than broad industry or macroeconomic 
trends.  The six-month trailing bond default rate  ticked up in December but remained at a 
low level, and the aggregate expected defau lt rate based on KMV data continued to edge 
down, reaching a level not seen since mid-1998.  
Business Finance 
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporat ions in December and January to date 
came in just a bit below the strong pace of October and November.  Issuance of 
speculative-grade bonds remained robust in D ecember, with reports indicating that the 
proceeds increasingly went to finance merger s, but offering of these bonds have dropped 
back a bit so far this year .  C&I loan growth strengthened in December and moved up 
further in the first half of January, consistent with reports of stronger demand and less-
restrictive lending standards and terms in th e Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  
Commercial paper dropped a bit, on net, in December and January, as some large firms 
paid down their outstandings at year-end.  Overall, net debt fi nancing by nonfinancial 
firms from C&I loans, commerci al paper, and bonds moved up in the fourth quarter to its 
highest quarterly rate in 2004 and appears to  have remained strong early this year. 
 
Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms increase d in December as initial public offerings 
picked up, but it has slowed in January.  Sh are repurchases, fueled  by strong profits and 
liquid balance sheets, are estimated to have ri sen to a record pace in the fourth quarter.  
At the same time, cash-financed mergers jumped to their highest pace in more than seven years, with Cingular’s cash acquisition of AT &T Wireless accounting fo r half the total.  
The anticipated repatriation of profits earne d overseas could keep equity retirements 
elevated over the coming year.  The Treasury Department announced in mid-January that 
repatriated profits could not be  used directly for share repur chases, but it noted that the 
use of funds freed up by repatriated profits would not be restricted. 
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt appe ars to have risen at a strong 9½ percent annual rate in the 
fourth quarter, and respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that 
demand for these loans has increased, on net, over the past three months.  The CMBS 
calendar suggests that issuance will slow in th e current quarter from its record pace in the

fourth quarter, but it will remain solid.  De spite abundant supply, CMBS spreads over the 
ten-year Treasury yield are still narrow.  Delinquency rates on loans backing CMBS have 
fallen almost 1 percentage point on net si nce their peak in late 2003, and delinquency 
rates on commercial mortgages on the books of banks and life insurance companies 
remain quite low. 
 
Household Finance 
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates change d little, on net, over the intermeeting period 
and have stayed in a narrow range around 5¾ pe rcent since last fall.  Low mortgage rates 
in the fourth quarter likely contributed to strong growth in home mortgage debt.  In 
contrast, the growth rate of consumer credit is estimated to have remained subdued, held 
down perhaps by the funding of household expe nditures with equity extracted from 
homes:  Although cash-out mortgage refinanc ing has recently been running well below 
the spectacular rates seen in 2002 and 2003, home  equity loans from all types of lenders 
increased at a record rate of 27 percent over the year ending in the third quarter. 
 
Measures of household credit quality have  continued to improve.  Delinquencies on 
credit card loans in securitized pools dec lined again in November , while those on auto 
loans at captive finance companies remained  low.  Household bankruptcy filings have 
continued to trend lower.  The ratio of net worth to disposable personal in come is estimated to have increased in the 
fourth quarter, reflecting the solid rise in stoc k prices and the staff’s estimate of a further 
increase in home prices based on data on the average prices of existing homes sold 
through November.  Inflows into equity mutu al funds picked up in the fourth quarter, 
consistent with the rise in stock returns that quarter.  
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury conducted auctions of two- and five-year notes and te n- and twenty-year 
TIPS over the intermeeting period.  Indirect bi dding, which partly re flects demand from 
foreign official institutions, took up a bit less than 40 percent of the issues, slightly below 
the average share over the past year.  Treasury securities held on behalf of foreign official 
institutions at the FRBNY c ontinued to grow robustly. 
 
Early in the intermeeting period, the SEC announ ced that it had determined that Fannie 
Mae had violated accounting rules.  The CEO and CFO subsequently announced that they 
would leave the firm.  In late December, Fanni e Mae placed $5 billion in preferred stock

and, in mid-January, cut its dividend on co mmon stock in half, in response to the 
OFHEO’s determination that it was “significantly undercapitalized.”   Fannie Mae’s 
stock price fell sharply on news of the dividend cu t.  In contrast to the hit to stock prices, 
agency debt spreads declined  slightly, apparently reflect ing reduced issuance and, as 
indicated by custody holdings at the FRBN Y over the period, continued strong demand 
for agency securities from fo reign official institutions. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds in December about matched the robust pace 
for last year as a whole.  Roughly three- quarters of the issuan ce was for new capital 
projects, most of which were related to education, housing, and transportation.  Advance 
refundings also continued to be robust, as states and municipalitie s continued to take 
advantage of low long-term interest rates.   The volume of short-term issuance was 
comparatively light in December, a development consistent with the improved budget 
situations in many states.  Cr edit quality has also showed improvement in recent months, 
with upgrades of municipal bonds far outpa cing downgrades.  The ratio of municipal 
bond yields to comparable Treasury yields  was little changed over the intermeeting 
period. 
 
Money and Bank Credit  
Based on partial data for January, M2 growth  appears to have remained moderate in 
recent months, owing primarily to rising oppor tunity costs associated with monetary 
policy tightening.  Growth of liquid deposits has been much slower than it was in the first 
half of 2004, likely as a result of higher short- term interest rates.  By contrast, increasing 
rates have contributed to a pickup in the gr owth of small time deposits, whose yields 
closely track market rates.  Currency was about  flat in December, depressed in part by 
significant reflows of currency from overseas.  Although growth of total bank credit slowed in December, most loan categories still 
expanded smartly.  C&I loans posted their sixt h consecutive month of positive growth in 
December.  Real estate loans continued to e xpand at a solid pace, although home equity 
lending at banks decelerated sharply in December,  perhaps owing in part to the effects of 
higher short-term interest rates.  Data for ear ly January suggest further gains in most loan 
categories.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The January 2005 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.  The survey contained a special question on the reasons why nonbank investors have increased their participation in the commerc ial and industrial (C&I) loan market recently. 
In addition, the survey asked ba nks about changes over the past year in their terms on commercial 
real estate loans.  Finally, banks were aske d why the share of industry assets accounted for by 
residential real estate loans has increased over th e past three years.  This appendix is based on 
responses from fifty-five domestic banks  and twenty foreign institutions. 
 As was the case throughout 2004, domestic a nd foreign banks reported in the January 2005 
survey that they had eased lending standards and terms for C&I loans and commercial real estate 
loans.  Demand for C&I loans increased, on net, at domestic banks but was unchanged at foreign 
institutions.  Demand for commercial real estate lo ans rose, on net, at both domestic and foreign 
banks in recent months.  A small number of  domestic banks eased st andards on residential 
mortgages over the past three months, while sta ndards and terms for cons umer loans were about 
unchanged, on balance.  Relatively large fracti ons of domestic banks re ported weaker demand for 
both residential mortgages and consumer loans.  
C&I Lending  
In the January survey, domestic banks reported a further net easing of lending standards on C&I 
loans.  One-fourth of domestic banks, on net, re ported having eased their standards for large and 
middle-market firms over the past three months, about the same fraction as in recent surveys.  
Thirteen percent of these institutions also indicat ed that they had eased their lending standards for 
small firms, down from nearly 20 percent in the Oc tober survey.  The share of U.S. branches and 
agencies of foreign banks that reported easier le nding standards for C&I loans was 20 percent, a 
noticeable decline from the 35 percent net easing in the previous survey. 
 
Both domestic and foreign institutions indicated  that they had continued easing lending terms on 
C&I loans over the past three months.  On net,  almost 50 percent of domestic banks trimmed 
spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for large and middle-market borrowers, about the 
same fraction as in the previous survey.  About  one-fourth did so for small firms, down from 
nearly 40 percent in the October survey.  More than half of foreign in stitutions reported having 
reduced spreads on their C&I loans in the January su rvey.  In addition, large fractions of domestic 
and foreign respondents indicated that they had eased other terms by increasing the maximum size of loans, loosening covenant restrictions, or reducing the costs of credit lines.  One bank 
commented that loan maturities had lengthened mark edly, a claim consistent with both the Survey 
of Terms of Business Lending and data from LoanPricing Corporation.    
III-A-2 
Almost all domestic and foreign respondents th at had eased their lending standards and terms 
over the past three months cited more aggr essive competition from other banks or nonbank 
lenders as the most important reason.  Large frac tions of domestic banks also pointed to a more 
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook and a higher tolerance for risk as reasons for their 
move toward a less stringent lending posture.  More than half of fo reign respondents cited 
increased liquidity in the secondary mark et for these loans as a reason for easing. 
 
In recent surveys, respondent banks have repor ted that they had eased standards or terms in 
response to increased competition from other sour ces of business credit.  This survey included a 
special question on why nonbank lenders have b ecome more aggressive competitors.  The most 
important reason, according to domestic banks, was that nonbanks have become more attracted to 
the senior status of loans in bankruptcy and rest ructuring proceedings.  Increased liquidity in the 
secondary market was the main reason cited by foreign institutions and a close second among the 
reasons given by domestic banks.  Domestic banks also pointed to the trend toward market-based 
pricing as a reason they considered important.  On net, about 45 percent of domestic institutions  reported an increase in demand for C&I loans 
from large and middle-market firms, up from about 25 percent in the October survey.  Almost 
30 percent, on net, indicated that demand from smal l firms had increased, about the same as in the 
previous survey.  In addition, nearly 50 percen t of domestic banks, on net, reported an increase in 
the number of inquiries from potential business borrowe rs, a larger fraction than in the October 
survey.  In contrast, foreign institutions repor ted that demand for C&I loans was unchanged over 
the past three months, although the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers at these institutions rose, on net.  Consistent with the growth of inventories seen la te in 2004, greater need for inventory financing 
was the most-often-cited reason for increased demand for C&I loans at domestic banks.  The second most important reason for increased demand noted in the January survey was an increase 
in merger and acquisition activity.  As was the cas e in previous surveys, large fractions of the 
respondents experiencing stronger loan demand also pointed to their borrowers = increased 
financing needs for accounts receivable and fo r investment in plant and equipment. 
 
Commercial Real Estate Lending   
About one-fourth of domestic banks reported a net easing of lending standards on commercial 
real estate loans over the past three months, a slight ly larger fraction than in the October survey.  
The net percentage of domestic banks that reported increased demand for such loans was 
16 percent, a modest decline from the 23 percent in the previous survey.  Of the thirteen foreign 
institutions in the survey that are active in the co mmercial real estate market, one indicated that it 
had eased standards, and two indicated that demand had increased. 
 
III-A-3 
For several years, the January su rvey has asked banks to report th e changes over the past twelve 
months in various commercial real estate loan te rms.  Almost half of the domestic and foreign 
respondents indicated that they had reduced spread s on loans over the past year, compared with a 
small fraction that reported having tightened spreads in the January 2004 survey.  About 
25 percent of domestic banks also indicated that they had increased the maximum size of loan 
that they were willing to extend last year, a bit mo re than had done so during 2003.  In addition, a 
modest fraction of domestic banks had eased limits on loan maturity over the past twelve months.  
By contrast, most foreign institutions reported that  they had kept non-price loan terms unchanged, 
but one indicated that it had tightened several terms considerably.  Domestic banks that had eased terms on commercial real estate loans gave reasons  very similar to those provided by banks that 
had eased terms on C&I loans: more competition from other lenders (bot h bank and nonbank), 
improved conditions in the commercial real est ate market, and a more favorable economic 
outlook.  
Lending to Households 
A few domestic banks, on net, eased credit standard s on residential mortgage loans over the past 
three months.  Nearly 30 percent of banks, on net, reported weaker demand for mortgages to 
purchase homes, about the same as in the October surv ey.   Nevertheless, over the past three years 
the share of residential real estate loans in banks ’ portfolios has risen noti ceably.  In response to a 
special question asking for the reasons behind this  growth, about 75 percent of the banks noted 
that the share of new originations that were adjustable-rate loans, which are better suited to 
holding in banks’ portfolios, increased over this pe riod.  About two-thirds of the banks said that 
strong demand for residential mortgages had s upported returns on them, thereby making such 
loans more profitable to hold.  Half of the banks  indicated that a widening of the spread between 
yields on residential mortgages and those on mortgage-backed securities had increased the 
attractiveness of the underlying loans.  About one-quarter of the banks said their mortgage 
holdings had increased because a larger share of  their originations did not conform to the 
standards set by the housing-related government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  However, three-
quarters of the banks that had reduced sales of mortgages to GSEs claimed that their capital was 
sufficient to support that growth, while a few banks reported limiting acquisitions of other assets 
as a result of the retained mortgages.  Although standards and terms on credit card and other consumer loans were about unchanged, 
12 percent of the respondents indicated that thei r willingness to make consumer installment loans 
had increased.  On net, 27 percent of domestic  respondents reported weaker demand for consumer 
loans in the January survey, about th e same as in the previous survey.

In November, the value of exports of goods and services plunged 2.3 percent, the first 
monthly decline since June.  Exports of goods fell 3.8 percent in a broadly based retreat.  
Exports of capital goods fell particularly steepl y, in part due to a decline in the volatile 
category of aircraft, but also  due to falls in exports of computers, semiconductors, 
telecommunications products, a nd other capital goods.  Services  exports rose 1.4 percent, 
largely due to an increase in travel-related serv ices.  At an annual rate, the average value 
of exported goods and services in October a nd November was about ½ percent above the 
third-quarter level.  Declines in exports of capital goods and automotive products were 
offset by increases in services, agricultu ral goods, industrial supplies, and consumer 
goods.  The value of imported goods and services rose 1.3 percent in November, a pace less than half that recorded in October.  Imports of goods rose just over 1 pe rcent, with the gain 
more than accounted for by an increase in th e value of imported oil,  as non-oil imports 
edged down.  A fall in industrial supplies le d the overall decline in non-oil imports, 
although auto imports also fell steeply.  Impor ts in the broad category of capital goods 
fell a bit, but the aggregate number masked strong gains in othe r capital goods and 
telecommunications products, which were offset  by a steep decline in imports of aircraft,

as well as in computers and semiconductors .  Imports of consumer goods and foods 
increased, and services imports rose about 2 pe rcent.  At an annual rate, the average value 
of imported goods and services in October and November was almost 19 percent above 
the second-quarter level.  A surge in oil impor ts fueled about half of the gain, with the 
remainder stemming importantly from gains in  consumer goods and, to a lesser extent, 
capital goods.  Imports of automotive products fell. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In December, the prices of U.S. im ports of non-oil goods and of core 
goods rose 0.5 and 0.6 percent, respectively.  Within core goods, prices for every major 
category increased.  The largest contribution came from industrial supplies, whose prices 
rose 1.3 percent, mostly because of higher pr ices for building materials and metals.  For 
foods, feeds and beverages, prices increas ed 1.0 percent.  Foll owing a 0.3 percent 
increase in November, prices for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) rose 0.5 percent.  Prices for imported consumer goods, which had not 
increased from February through October, rose 0.3 percent in December, the second 
consecutive monthly increase.  Import prices of computer s and semiconductors declined 
in December. 
 
The average level of prices of imported core  goods in the fourth quarter was 4.5 percent 
at an annual rate above the th ird-quarter level.  The main contributions to the increase 
were from non-oil industrial supplies and foods.  Both automotive products and, to a 
lesser extent, capital goods (excluding com puters and semiconductors) also experienced 
price gains. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil fell 11.5 pe rcent in December.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (W TI), a light, low-sulfur cr ude oil, fell 10.6 percent in 
December—averaging about $43.30 per barrel.  Si nce late December, the spot price has 
retraced much of the decline, due in pa rt to decreased production by OPEC, supply 
disruptions in Norway and Canada, and incr eased violence in Iraq in the run-up to 
elections on January 30.  In addition, str ong world oil demand continues to provide 
upward pressure on prices.  The spot pr ice of WTI closed at $49.45 per barrel on 
January 25. 
 
IV-6 
Exports.  In December, the prices of U.S. exports  of total goods and of core goods both 
increased 0.2 percent.  Much of December’s rise was due to higher prices for capital 
goods (excluding computers and semiconducto rs) and consumer goods, which increased 
0.2 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.  After climbing 2.5 percent in October and 
0.9 percent in November, prices for industr ial supplies were unchanged in December.  
For both computers and semiconduc tors, export prices fell.  
 
The average level of prices of exported core  goods in the fourth quarter was 4.9 percent 
at an annual rate above the thir d-quarter level.  A large incr ease in prices for industrial 
supplies more than offset a large decline in th e prices for exported agricultural products.  
Additional positive contributions came from both capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and automotive products.  Expo rt prices for consumer goods increased 
slightly. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) picked up sharply to $58 bi llion in November of last year, only a bit 
below the near-record monthly inflows record ed in April and June and well above the 
monthly average registered for the first ten months of 2004.  Private inflows into U.S. 
securities through November amounted to $435 billion, above the $369 inflows recorded 
for all of 2003.    The pickup in private foreign inflows in November was widespread across asset 
categories.  Foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasuries (line 4a) and equities (line 
4d) recovered following considerable weakness since the summer.  Purchases of agency 
bonds (line 4b) were strong for the second consecutive month;  purchases in October and 
November accounted for nearly half of all agency bonds acquired by private foreigners through the first eleven months  of 2004.  Private purchases of corporate debt (line 4c) 
remained strong.    Net foreign official inflows ( line 1) slowed a bit to $20 billion in November, with sizable 
inflows recorded for Japan, China, and Korea of fset in part by an outflow recorded for 
Norway.  Foreign official inflows for the year through November amounted to 
$331 billion, compared with $245 billion reco rded for 2003.  Partial data from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) indicate moderate further increases in 
IV-7 
official reserve assets in December and th rough mid-January, primarily reflecting further 
increases in holdings for China.  However, the increase in China’s reserves held at 
FRBNY in the fourth quarter is well below the estimates that have circulated in financial 
markets of the increase in China’s total reserve holdings over this period. 
 U.S. investors made large net purchases of fo reign securities (line 5) in November.  For 
the second month in row, U.S. investors prim arily acquired foreign stocks (line 5a), but 
also made modest purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a).  A series break in reported net 
purchases of foreign bonds makes it difficult to compare current transactions in foreign bonds with the sales recorded  in previous quarters.  
 The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a very small ne t inflow in November and a 
cumulative outflow of $10 billion fo r the first eleven months of 2004. 
 Balance of payments data indicate roughly offsetting direct inve stment inflows and 
outflows in both the second and third quarters.  U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) 
remained strong, in part reflecting retained ear nings in advance of th e partial tax holiday 
in effect this year.  Foreign direct investment  in the United States (line 7) also picked up 
in the third quarter.    The statistical discrepancy was positive in the third quarter and for th e first three quarters 
of 2004 taken together, indicating some comb ination of overreporting of the current 
account deficit or underreporting of net capital inflows.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The exchange value of the dollar against majo r foreign currencies wa s volatile during the 
intermeeting period, but ended th e period little changed on a tr ade-weighted basis.  The 
dollar’s bilateral moves were mixed, falli ng 2¼ and ½ percent against the yen and 
Canadian dollar, respectivel y, but rising 2 to 3 percent against the major European 
currencies.  The nominal broad index of the dollar declined slightly on net.                   After depreciating against a broad range of currencies in the last  weeks of December 
amid light trading conditions typical for the end of the calendar year, the dollar surprised 
many currency analysts in the first week of the new year by appreciating sharply.  There 
was little consensus among market  participants about the fact ors driving the gains in the 
dollar.  Following the release of the December FOMC minutes and stronger-than-
expected U.S. factory orders data, discussions  centered on expected further increases in 
U.S. short-term interest rates and the rela tive strength of the U.S. economic outlook vis-à-
vis Europe and Japan as positive factors for the dollar.  However, the release of the much larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for November prompted a pause in the reported 
dominance of these factors in shaping market  sentiment and at least temporarily halted 
the prevailing upward trend in the dollar.  Comments by Treasury Secretary Snow in 
mid-January, which were initially interpreted as signaling an increas ed willingness by the

Administration to engage in intervention operations, prompt ed the dollar to appreciate 
briefly.  However the dollar subsequently more  than reversed these gains after Secretary 
Snow corrected this interpre tation and reiterated the govern ment’s belief in the free 
market determination of exchange rates.  Th e dollar was supported la te in the period, in 
part, by comments by Federal Reserve officials which market participants interpreted as 
implying a somewhat faster rate of intere st rate increases in the United States.  
 
The dollar’s relative weakness against the yen and Canadian dollar were due in part to 
currency-specific factors.  The yen was suppor ted early and again late in the period by 
evidence of strengthening capital expenditure s by Japanese firms.  The yen was also 
marginally supported agains t the dollar following comments by a high ranking ECB 
official who suggested that th e euro had already adjusted fu lly against the dollar and that 
any further correction in the latter currency’s exchange va lue should be borne by Asian 
currencies.  The Canadian dollar was suppor ted against the dollar by news of stronger-
than-expected Canadian job growth and an unexpected increase in the Canadian trade 
surplus for November.  As had been wide ly expected, policymakers at the Bank of 
Canada decided to leave their policy rate  unchanged at 2.5 percent on January 25.

Policy makers in the euro area and the Unite d Kingdom also left their respective policy 
rates unchanged in decisions this period and Japan did not change its targ et range for 
reserves.  Net movements in foreign-currency short-term interest rates were 
correspondingly small, as were movement s in most foreign industrial economy 
benchmark government bond yields.  Expectations  for future monetary policy in Europe 
and Japan changed little on net, and conti nue to suggest little  likelihood of policy 
tightening at least through the first half of 2005, and measures of inflati on expectations in 
these currency regions remain low.   Major equity indexes in Europe saw mode st gains while Japanese equity prices 
outperformed global markets, led by price gains in shares of machinery and real estate 
firms.  The rise in oil prices had little repor ted effect on foreign equity prices and implied 
volatilities on equity indexes re main at historical lows.   
 On balance, the index of the dollar’s value against our other importa nt trading partners 
fell about ¾ percent this period.  The dolla r depreciated a further 2½ and 2 percent, 
respectively, against the Korean won and Ta iwan dollar despite re ports of heightened 
dollar purchases by monetary au thorities in these countries .  The expected amount of 
appreciation of the Chinese reminbi agains t the dollar over the next twelve months 
implied by forward contracts fluctuated duri ng the period amid conf licting statements by 
Chinese officials regarding the timing of a pot ential change in China’s currency peg.  At 
the end of the period, these rates implied a 5 percent appreciation in the currency.  
The tsunamis in the Indian O cean had little discernable eff ect on asset valuations in 
Indonesia and Thailand, where stock markets regi stered net gains of about 10 percent.  
Indeed, the currencies of these countries ha ve appreciated modes tly against the dollar 
since the December FOMC meeting, supported in part by the inflow of financial aid 
following the disaster.  In Latin America, the Brazil real appreciated over 3 percent against the dollar on net.  
The central bank of Brazil increased its polic y rate a total of 100 basis points in two 
decisions on December 15 and January 19.  Equi ty prices in Brazil and Mexico saw their 
first substantial declines in several months as U.S. markets declined in early January.  
Although the Mexican stock market quickly more than reversed those losses, the 
Brazilian equity market did not and ended the intermeeting period 3 percent lower on net.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Indicators of economic activity in the ma jor foreign industrial economies generally 
remained soft in the fourth quarter.  Wh ile labor conditions c ontinued to improve 
gradually in Japan, measures of industrial  production, business confidence and household 
expenditures have all fallen.  Euro-area data  on balance remained sluggish:  the latest 
readings on overall industri al production and retail sales in the euro area have both 
declined.  Fourth-quarter GDP in the Unite d Kingdom expanded str ongly, with a brisk 
rise in the service sector.  Likewise, indicators of Canadian domestic demand remained 
robust, but exports continued to slide, and GDP by industry was unchanged again in 
October.    Headline rates of consumer price inflation fini shed the fourth quarter up a tad in the euro 
area and the United Kingdom, but down a bit in  Canada.  Inflation remains a bit above 
the ECB ceiling rate in the euro area.  Defl ation in Japanese core consumer prices 
increased slightly.  In Japan , recent readings on economic activity have  been weak.  On average, industrial 
production for October and November was down 0.6 percent from the th ird-quarter level, 
depressed by weakness in electronics-related s ectors.  The all-indus tries index of output 
rebounded in November, but remained on track for a decline in the fourth quarter.  
Household expenditures were down nearly 2 percent in October and November on 
average compared with the thir d-quarter average, and new car registrations in the fourth 
quarter were roughly flat.  Real exports were about flat in the fourth quarter, but imports 
increased, implying another negative contribut ion to growth from net exports.  In 
particular, imports of vegetables rose marked ly following a series of typhoons in Japan.  
On a more promising note, core machiner y orders, a leading indicator of business 
investment, surged nearly 20 percent in N ovember from the previous month, following 
several months of declines.  The Bank of Japan’s Tankan index of busine ss conditions posted a slight decline in 
December, with the level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment among 
firms of all sizes and across a ll industries slipping to 1 from 2 in September.  Survey 
respondents project a further dec line in the index, to -3, fo r March.  The index for large 
manufacturers decreased to 22, fr om 26 in September, marking th e first fall in two years.   
 
IV-14 
Labor market conditions continued their gra dual improvement, but deflation worsened a 
little.  The unemployment rate declin ed to 4.5 percent in November, although 
employment fell.  The job-offers-to-applican ts ratio, a leading indicator of employment, 
rose to a fresh twelve-year high.  Averag e nominal wages continued to fall through 
November, dragged down by an increase in the share of part-time workers in the 
workforce.  Core consumer goods prices in  the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but 
include energy) ticked down in December from the previous month and were down 0.4 
percent from a year earlier.  Wholesale pr ice inflation eased a little in December.

Japan’s Cabinet approved the fiscal budge t for FY2005 (April 2005-March 2006) in late 
December.  Expenditures will rise slightly re lative to FY2004’s initial budget.  Additional 
expenditures on social security and a 5 percent rise in debt-servicing costs will be largely 
offset by cuts in most other categories, in cluding public works spe nding, which is slated 
to decline 3.6 percent.  Tax revenues are projected to rise 5.4 percent, on the back of a 
recovering economy and the phasing out of past ta x cuts, marking the first increase in tax 
revenues in four years.  The budget will re quire ¥34.2 trillion in new bond issuance for 
IV-15 
FY2005, about ¥2.2 trillion less than in FY2004.  A ll told, fiscal policy is expected to 
have a somewhat contractionary effect on GDP this year. 
 Incoming data for the euro area appear to signal a limited pickup in growth from the 
third quarter.  French consumption of manu factured products rose in both October and 
November to a level roughly 2 percent above  the September level, consistent with a 
resurgence in household demand in the fourth qua rter after the third quarter’s decline.  
German economic activity remained weak:  based on an official preliminary estimate of 2004 annual GDP growth, German GDP in the four th quarter appears to have grown at a 
0.6 percent annual rate, only sligh tly above the 0.4 percent rate  in the third quarter.  GDP 
expenditure components are not yet availabl e, but merchandise export data suggest 
renewed German export growth afte r the third quarter’s decline.

The preliminary estimate of twelve-month consum er price inflation in the euro area rose 
to 2.4 percent in December.  The ECB measure of twelve-month core inflation, excluding 
energy and unprocessed foods, rose back to 2 percent in December.  Labor market 
conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 8.9 
percent in November.  The harmonized unemployment rate in Germany rose to 10 
percent in December. 
 
IV-16 
Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose a much higher-than-expected 3 percent (s.a.a.r.) 
in the fourth quarter, according to the prel iminary estimate.  In contrast, industrial 
production is estimated to have fallen nearly 2½ percent.  A fall in oil and gas extraction 
was mainly responsible for the contraction in production.  The service sector, which 
accounts for around 72 percent of the economy, grew  more than 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter.  Construction expanded just over 3 percent. 
 Increases in house prices slow ed sharply over the last seve ral months of 2004, with house 
prices remaining almost flat over the fourth  quarter.  Household net mortgage borrowing 
in November fell about 8 per cent from its October level and is now about 20 percent 
below its 2003 peak.

The labor market continued to be tight; the official-claims-based measure of the 
unemployment rate remained near its lowest  point since 1975, and the labor-force-survey 
IV-17 
measure stayed near its all-time low.  The tw elve-month rate of consumer price inflation 
edged up in December, but stayed below the Bank of England’s 2 percent target. 
   In Canada , external demand continued to weaken in the fourth quarter.  In November, 
merchandise exports fell for the fifth c onsecutive month, and import growth paused 
following strong gains the previous several mo nths.  The manufacturing sector, which is 
heavily export-oriented, has s een a mixed performance, with shipments up but new orders 
down in November .  Weakness in manufacturing was a le ading cause of the zero growth 
in GDP by industry recorded in October.  The sector may have rebounded somewhat in December, however, as a leading indicator of  new orders jumped 1 percent, the largest 
rise in this indicator in six months.

In contrast, domestic demand seems to ha ve remained healthy throughout the fourth 
quarter.  Housing starts in December con tinued their year-long vigor, marking 2004 as 
the strongest year for new home construction since 1987.   Although retail sales slipped a 
bit in November, the dip came on the heels of a blistering advance in October, as gains in 
personal income supported consumer spendi ng through much of 2004.   The composite 
index of leading indicators turned up 0.2 pe rcent in December, after being unchanged in 
November, which had marked the end of a four-month deceleration in the indicator.

The labor market rebounded in December, afte r a dip in November, as total employment 
posted a strong gain, and the unemployment rate fell to 7 percent, it s lowest point since 
May 2001.  In 2004, total employment grew 1.4 pe rcent, with most of the gains in full-
time employment.  
 
In December, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation dipped, as gasoline prices 
continued to decline.  The tw elve-month rate of core infl ation, excluding the eight most 
volatile components, held steady at 1.5 percent in December.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
After having slowed in the past few quarter s, incoming data on economic activity in the 
fourth quarter suggest that real GDP grow th edged up in Latin America and emerging 
Asia on average.  Consumer price inflation in many emerging market economies rose last 
year, partly due to higher oil prices.   The Chinese  economy continues to expand at a robust pace.  Real GDP grew 
11.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the f ourth quarter, despite a steep fall in investment spending 
(staff estimate), as retail sa les growth remained strong a nd the trade surplus widened.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation droppe d sharply to 3.2 per cent in the fourth 
quarter, reflecting continued declines in food prices.

In Taiwan, both production and exports fell in the fourth quarter.  However, forward-
looking indicators are more positive, as orders  for high-tech exports hit a new high in the 
fourth quarter.  In addition, strong gains in imports of both consumer and capital goods 
suggest that domestic demand remained r obust in the fourth quarter.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation stayed around 1½ percent in December.

Incoming indicators for economic activity in Korea  suggest that growth will remain 
subdued in the fourth quarter and heavily dependent on external demand.  Both production and exports were up in  October and November rela tive to the third quarter, 
but retail sales fell and both consumer and business sentiment remained weak.  Activity 
IV-24 
in the service sector also has continued to contract.  Twelve-month consumer price 
inflation dropped to 3 percent in December fr om November’s 3.3 percent, the lowest rate 
since last March, largely as a result of lower fuel price inflation.  The Bank of Korea 
decided to keep interest rate s constant at its meeting on January 13, noting that domestic 
demand remains sluggish while export growth is steady.

In the ASEAN  region, recent performance has been  mixed. In Singapore, industrial 
production expanded 6.6 percent in the four th quarter. The strong fourth quarter 
performance was driven by a surge in the vol atile biomedical production in December. In 
Malaysia, where anecdotal evidence suggests that fourth-quarter domestic demand was 
relatively strong, industrial pr oduction was also up. Elsewh ere in the region, average 
production fell in the most recent months ava ilable. Trade data indicate that the ASEAN 
economies as a whole continued to  run a trade surplus in the final months of last year, 
although country-specific surpluses, with the exception of Singapore, have recently been 
declining, as weak global demand for high-tech  products appears to have been weighing 
down on export growth.  Consumer price inflation re mains elevated across th e region relative to 2003.  
Nonetheless, the monetary authorities have been  reluctant to increase interest rates, so as 
to avoid dampening domestic demand.  The ex ception is in Thaila nd where the central 
bank increased its benchmark interest rate 25 basis points to 2 percent in December, the 
third rate increase since August 2004.

On December 26, an earthquake off of th e coast of Indonesia generated a massive 
tsunami that killed over 200,000 people in the region.  While the ultimate economic 
effect of this disaster is no t yet fully known, it is generally expected that it will have a 
small impact for several reasons.  First, very few industrial plants in the ASEAN 
countries were affected.  Second, although the hu man toll is large in absolute terms, as a 
percent of the countries’ aggr egate population, it is not part icularly large.  Third, the 
negative effects of the disaster itself will be tempered by reconstruction activity and 
disaster financing relief.

 In Mexico , recent data releases suggest some pi ckup in economic activity after a soft 
performance in the third quarter.  Indust rial production edged up in November, and 
manufacturing exports registered  a solid performance in rece nt months as a result of 
growing demand from the United States.  In dicators of consumption and investment 
spending have continued to be strong, with a bo om in consumer credit fueling retail sales.  
High oil revenues have continued to allow gove rnment spending to provide a significant 
stimulus to the economy.  In an unexpected move intended to moderate  inflation expectations at a key round of 
year-end salary negotiations, in mid-Decembe r the Bank of Mexico tightened policy for 
the ninth time during 2004.  Consumer pric es stood at 5.2 percent for year-end 2004, 
outside the upper limit of the 2 to 4 percent inflation target, as a result of high food and 
energy prices.  However, inflation in D ecember edged down compared with November, 
and it appears to have begun to trend downwards as some food prices have begun to fall.  
In a further effort to cut prices, the gove rnment announced in December that it would 
IV-27 
reduce the price of some regulated goods, such  as domestic gas and electricity, and slash 
import tariffs on machinery and industrial equipment.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook  have pointed to a continued slowdown 
in economic activity over the fourth quarter fr om the robust growth seen over the first 
half of 2004.  Industrial produc tion, which had peaked in August, declined 0.4 percent in 
November.  Some analysts nonetheless pr edict a rebound in indus trial output in 
December, pointing in part to  robust December vehicle sales, which were up 20 percent 
on a twelve-month basis.    Inflation has been a major concern.  Decem ber headline consumer price inflation was 
0.8 percent (s.a.), bringing the twelve-mont h increase to 7.6 percent, well above the 
central bank’s 5.1 percent target for 2005.  A rise in inflation in recent months reflects, in 
part, hikes in domestic prices of fuel in October and November by Petrobras, the 
government-controlled oil firm, which had last ra ised prices in June.  Nevertheless, core 
inflation, which excludes energy and other admi nistered prices and food, has also been 
edging up, and ended 2004 at 7½ percent on a tw elve-month basis.  As expected, the 
central bank on January 19 raised  its policy rate 50 basis poi nts for the fifth consecutive 
IV-28 
month, to 18¼ percent.  The policy rate is  up 225 basis points since the central bank 
began tightening in September.

In Argentina , the economic recovery picked up steam in the third quarter, with real GDP 
growing at an annual rate of 12 percent, follo wing a weak second quart er.  Fourth-quarter 
indicators are consistent with  continued strong growth, althou gh at a more moderate pace.  
Industrial production in the fourth quarter was more than 2 percent above its third-quarter 
level, slightly less than its Q3 pace of increase.  The trade surplus was nearly $13 billion in November; nominal exports have r ecently been supported by higher commodities 
prices.  December consumer price inflati on was 2.0 percent (s.a.)  at a monthly rate, 
bringing the twelve-month increase to 6.2 pe rcent, just below the central bank’s 2004 
projection band of 7 to 11 percent.    After more than three years in default, the Argentine government launched its debt swap 
on January 14 with the goal of restructuri ng $82 billion in defaulted bonds.  The swap 
offer will remain open until February 25.  The government reached a prior agreement with local pension funds to restructure the defaulted paper they hold, ensuring a 
minimum acceptance of some 17 percent.

In Venezuela , the sparse information that is avai lable points to con tinued expansion in 
economic activity in the fourth quarter.  Gove rnment spending is estimated to have risen

In Russia , real GDP slid ½ percent in the thir d quarter, as the strong contribution by 
exports was not enough to offset surging im ports and declining investment.  While 
November indicators of economic activity were  quite strong across a range of sectors, 
industrial production was flat in December, br inging full-year growth to 6 percent.  
Consumer price inflation edged down to 0.7 pe rcent in December from 0.9 in November, 
although full-year inflation was 11.6 percent, well above the government’s 8-10 percent 
inflation projection.  The government auctioned Yukos’ key pr oduction facility, Yuganskneftegaz, on 
December 19.  Before the auction, Yukos’ ma nagement filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection in Houston.  The auction, however, took place as scheduled, and the winner 
was Baikal Finance Group, with a bid of  $9.4 billion dollars, above the $8.7 billion 
minimum price but less than the amount of Yuko s’ tax bill.  There was some uncertainty 
over the winner’s identity for several days until state-owned Rosneft, which is in the 
process of merging with Gazprom, pu rchased the financing group, effectively 
re-nationalizing the facility.  The bankruptcy filing severe ly complicated the Kremlin’s 
plan for merging Gazprom, Rosneft, and Y uganskneftegaz, with Ru ssian officials saying 
that the Gazprom-Rosneft merger will take place as sche duled, but without 
Yuganskneftegaz.
