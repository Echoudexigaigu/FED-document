Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Overview 
The economy appears to be expanding at a solid  pace this quarter.  Consumer spending is 
on track for another brisk gain, and residen tial construction expend itures continue to 
trend higher.  In addition, apart from moto r vehicle expenditures, spending on equipment 
and software appears to have entered 2005 with considerable th rust.  Industrial 
production increased moderately in January and February.  More broadly, firms across 
the economy continued to add employees at a steady pace early this year.  Both overall 
and core consumer prices moved up in January after no change in December. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
The labor market continued to improve in February.  Private nonfarm payroll 
employment rose 229,000 last month for the fi fth consecutive monthly increase of more 
than 100,000 jobs—the longest  such stretch since 1999.1  Job gains last month were 
widespread across industries.  Manufact uring employment moved up 20,000 after five 
straight months of decline.  Constructi on employment bounced back after having been 
held down by inclement weather in January, and retail trade registered a large increase as 
well.  Employment also rose br iskly in February in the servic es sector with gains in most 
services categories. 
 The workweek was revised down to 33.7 hours in December and is reported to have remained at that level through February.  S till, aggregate hours in creased 0.2 percent in 
February to a level 0.4 percent a bove the fourth-quarter average. 
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate  moved back up to its December level of 
5.4 percent, and the labor force participati on rate held steady at 65.8 percent.  The 
employment-population ratio, which combin es these two measures, fell back to 
62.3 percent in February, a level below its f ourth-quarter average but above the lows 
reached in the middle of 2003.
2  Smoothing through the recent fluctuations in the data, 
both the unemployment rate and the employ ment-population ratio suggest that while 
slack remains in the labor market, it is diminishing. 
                                                 
1 The January employment report included the annual benchmark revision to the payroll survey, which 
raised the level of total nonfarm payroll employment by  161,000 in December.  The revised data have been 
incorporated in the BLS measures of hours worked in the nonfarm bus iness sector, which are used in 
estimating productivity. 
2 In contrast to the increase in nonfarm payroll employment, household employment was about 
unchanged on net in January and February.  Over the past twelve months, payroll employment has risen 
2.4 million, and household employment has risen 1.8 million.

Most other labor market indicators appear to  support that impression.  The percentage of 
individuals working part time for economic r easons dropped sharply in  February and now 
stands 0.2 percentage point below its av erage level in 2004.  Similarly, both the 
percentage of firms with hard-to-fill positions (from a survey by the National Federation 
of Independent Businesses (NFIB)) and the pe rcentage of households believing jobs are 
plentiful rather than hard to get (from a survey by the Conference Board) have improved 
recently.  In addition, the help-wanted index ti cked up to a recent high in January, and job 
openings as measured in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) have 
moved up, on balance, over the past year.  Most measures of hiring and job separation point to continued solid employment growth 
in coming months.  The JOLTS hiring rate m oved up toward the end of last year, and 
both the Manpower and the NFIB measures of hiring plans have remained at relatively 
high levels.  In addition, initial claims for unemployment insurance have averaged 
313,000 over the past four weeks, well below the levels prevailing toward the end of last 
year.  In contrast, household expectations for the labor market as measured by both the 
Conference Board and the Michigan surveys we re somewhat less optimistic in February. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statisti cs reported that output per hour for all persons in the 
nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter; 
the staff’s current estimate is 2.8 percent.  Over the four quarters of 2004, we estimate 
that productivity rose a little under 3 percent, a deceleration from the outsized gain of 5½ 
percent in 2003 but close to the average rate of increase since 1995.

Industrial Production  
After increasing 0.1 percent in January, to tal industrial production (IP) moved up 
0.3 percent in February.  A surge in the production of motor vehicles and parts 
contributed importantly to the increase in tota l IP last month.  Mini ng output also edged 
up, but utilities output dropped for a s econd consecutive month as a result of 
unseasonably warm weather.   
 Manufacturing IP excluding motor vehicles e dged up just 0.1 percent in February.  But 
that modest increase came on the heels of four solid monthly gains, and the diffusion 
index of three-month percent changes for IP remained elevated, an indication that there 
has been fairly widespread improvement in the factory sector in recent months.  The 
manufacturing operating rate moved up fo r the fifth consecutive month, rising to 
78.5 percent, but was still 1.3 percenta ge points below its 1972-2004 average. 
Motor vehicle assemblies rose 700,000 in Febr uary to an annual rate of 12.6 million 
units.  In March, however, assemblies are schedu led to fall back to an annual rate of 
12.2 million units, a decline that would shave about 0.1 percentage point from the change in IP this month.  Elsewhere in transportati on, the output of commerci al aircraft expanded 
for the second consecutive month in February.  Boeing recently announced an increase in 
planned assemblies in 2006, a move that sugge sts that the level of production in this 
category should increase at a brisk pace throughout the year. 
 Overall production of high-tech goods rose 1½ percent in February.  Although the output 
of communications equipment jumped more than 2¼ percent for a second consecutive month, production increases for computers conti nued at the relatively sluggish pace of 
recent months.  Semiconductor output rose at a moderate clip in February after having 
accelerated noticeably in the previous three months.  The stepped-up gains for semiconductors coincide with reports from i ndustry contacts that the excess inventories 
that had accumulated last year at semiconduc tor manufacturers and the electronics firms 
that use their chips have been largely e liminated.  Although orders for semiconductor 
equipment have dropped lately, rising cap acity utilization rate s for semiconductor 
manufacturers could signal a recovery in  equipment sales later in the year.  
 Consistent with this interpre tation, Intel’s midquarter update to its earnings forecast for 
the first quarter points to a more rapid pace of real semiconductor output in coming 
months.  Intel, along with IBM and other manuf acturers, also has bullish plans to press 
ahead with the release of next-generation ch ips, especially for high-end servers.

Reinforcing this optimism, Gartner’s prelimin ary estimates point to a pickup in sales for 
both PCs and servers in the first quarter.   
 Nevertheless, many industry analysts remain  cautious about the high-tech outlook.  For 
semiconductors, our contact at the Semiconduc tor Industries Associ ation (SIA) expects 
nominal sales to increase at a rate in the hi gh single-digits in 2005, roughly half the long-
run historical average.  For com puters and communications equipment, CIO Magazine ’s 
diffusion indexes for future spending on computer hardware and on networking 
equipment have trended down in recent mont hs, although these indexes remain elevated.  
Echoing this view, Gartner’s IT Watch  for February predicts cautious business spending 
in 2005 on computers and co mmunications equipment. 
 The output of business equipment excludi ng high-tech, transp ortation, and energy 
production ticked down in February after havi ng posted large gains in the previous two 
months.  The production of both construction an d business supplies, as well as materials, 
also declined in February.  In contrast, the production of consumer goods increased as 
production of both durables and nondurables moved up.    Most of the forward-looking indicators of pr oduction, as well as reports from the staff’s 
industry contacts, suggest that activity in the i ndustrial sector will continue to expand at a 
moderate pace in the coming months.  For example, th e three-month mo ving average of 
the staff’s series on real adjusted durable goods orders advanced 1.8 percent in January.  
And although the diffusion index of new orders  as measured by the Institute for Supply 
Management has trended down from the high le vels in late 2003, it nevertheless remained 
elevated last month; in add ition, the index of new export or ders moved up.  Finally, the 
various regional diffusion indexes are still at levels that suggest further gains in 
production.  
Motor Vehicles   
Sales of light vehicles dropped sharply in the first two months of the year to an average 
annual rate of 16.3 million units, down nearly one million units from the average pace in 
the second half of last year.  The decline wa s concentrated in the retail sector, most 
notably in the sales of light trucks.  The au tomakers attributed some of the weakness in 
January and February to a payback from the unusually high sales rate in December.  In 
addition, part of the decline likely reflected the continued paring ba ck of incentives.  
Average incentives per vehicle have been  falling since October, and the level of 
incentives in early March was the lowest in a bout two years.  Confidential reports from

the automakers early this mont h suggest that they expect li ght vehicle sales to edge up 
slightly in March. 
 Consistent with the decline in incentives, consumers’ perceptions of buying conditions 
have become more negative.  The Michigan  SRC index of car-buying attitudes fell for a 
second month in February, and an increased fraction of respondents cited high prices as 
the reason for their worsened perceptions.  T hose views appear to be well grounded: The 
CPI for new vehicles has accelerated sharply, w ith an average monthly increase of nearly 
0.5 percent per month over the four  months ending in January.   
 Despite the slowdown in sales, motor ve hicle production picked up in January and 
February, and inventories rose sharply over this period.  The increase in stocks was 
particularly large for light trucks, for which days’ supply on dealer lots approached ninety 
days; days’ supply for autos also moved up but  only to about sixty days.  Automakers’ 
initial production schedules for the second quarter call for a sizable drop in total 
assemblies, to an annual rate of 11.8 million un its.  This drop, however, is concentrated in 
autos, while scheduled truck assemblies are a bi t above the rate in th e first quarter.  This 
production schedule presents something of a pu zzle because it implies that inventories of 
light trucks will remain high through the spring unless sales pick up noticeably.  One 
possible explanation is that with an increasi ng variety of light truck models, automakers 
are willing to tolerate higher levels of overall stocks.

Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending increased at an annual rate  of nearly 4¼ percent last quarter, and 
supported by strong income gains and rising wealth, it is on track for another solid 
advance in the current quarter.  Although hous ehold purchases of motor vehicles appear 
to be stepping down this quarter , other outlays have continued to  rise at a br isk pace.  In 
the retail control category of  goods—which excludes sales by auto dealers and building 
material and supply stores—nominal spendi ng increased 1.1 percent in January and 
0.6 percent in February.  The gains in recen t months have been widespread, but have 
been especially strong at el ectronics and appliance stores  and at clothing stores.  
Factoring in our projection of consumer prices, we estimate th at real spending in the PCE 
control category increased 0.9 percent in January and 0.3 percent in February.3  
Meanwhile, real outlays for consumer services  rose 0.2 percent in January (the latest 
available data), and the increases were broadly based.  
 The fundamental factors underl ying consumer spending are qu ite favorable.  Disposable 
personal income is now reported to have increas ed more rapidly in th e second half of last 
year than we estimated at the time of th e January Greenbook.  The increase reflects an 
upward revision to wages and salaries based on unemployment insurance tax records for 
the third quarter.  In recent months, a number of special  factors have buffeted personal 
income.  The Microsoft dividend payout provide d a large, temporary boost to income in 
December, and annual cost-of-living increases in  federal government salaries and transfer 
payments generated a small, permanent increas e in income in January (offset partly by 
annual increases in contributions to social  insurance programs).  Leaving aside these 
special factors, real disposable personal in come increased at an average annual rate of 
about 6½ percent in December and January, a rate noticeably higher than the 2¾ percent 
that prevailed over the first th ree quarters of 2004.  Regarding wealth, increases in equity 
prices and house values pushe d up the wealth-income ratio in  the fourth quarter to its 
highest level since early 2001.  The saving ra te was 3.6 percent in December (0.4 percent 
excluding the effect of the Mi crosoft dividend on income) and 1.0 percent in January, still 
low by historical standards.  
                                                
 
3 The difference in January growth  rates between real PCE control and nominal retail control cannot be 
explained by changes in prices (which were roughly flat in January for this category of goods).  It reflects 
instead an unusual divergence between nominal PCE control and retail control that is due to two factors:  
First, the BEA inserted a stepdown in the level of  PCE control between December and January to account 
for the fact that 2004 was a leap year and 2005 is no t; and second, there was an unusually large decline in 
“other motor vehicles,” a category of spending that is  included in the control category and available to the 
BEA but not to Board staff.

According to surveys by both the Michigan SRC and the Conference Board, consumer 
sentiment edged down in February, as the expectations components of both surveys 
weakened.  However, both indexes remain at levels consistent with  the continued solid 
gains in consumer spending that are suggested by the fundamentals.   
 
Housing Markets  
Starts of single-family homes rose slightly in February to an annual rate of almost 
1.8 million units.  During the first two months of  this year, single-family starts averaged 
1.77 million units, 9¼ percent higher than the aver age pace in the fourth quarter of last 
year.  The level of permits for single-family  homes (adjusted for activity in areas where 
permits are not required) wa s considerably lower than starts in both January and 
February, and the permit backlog declined in bo th months, an indicati on that starts likely 
will show a decline in March.  In the multifamily sector, starts rose 1.7 percent in 
February to an annual rate of 420,000 units.  The average level of multifamily starts in 
January and February was 17½ percent higher th an the fourth-quarter reading.  However, 
the permit backlog for multifamily starts decl ined during the past two months, suggesting 
that starts moderated in March. 
  Home sales fell in January, but other indica tors do not suggest a downshift in housing 
demand.  Sales of new homes were at an annual rate of 1.11 million units in January, nearly 10 percent less than the fourth-quarter level.  Sales of single-family existing homes 
edged down slightly in January, and their 5.94 million unit pace was just 1¾ percent less 
than the fourth-quarter average, the highest qu arterly level on record.  Builders’ ratings of 
new home sales during the first three months of  this year were at the high end of the 
elevated range that has prevailed during the past year and a half.  The thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rate stood at 5.85 percent on March 10, up only 11 basis points from the 
average during the fourth quarter  of last year; the one-year ad justable mortgage rate has 
increased about the same amount.  The mo st recent reading on the four-week moving 
average of the Mortgage Bankers Association index of mortgage a pplications for home 
purchase was in the middle of the range it has occupied during the past year and a half.     
 Home prices have continued to rise rapidl y.  The repeat-transactions price index for 
existing homes, which measures the change in the value of properties when they are sold 
or refinanced, rose 11¼ percent over the year  ending in the fourth quarter, a pace below 
the year-over-year reading in the previous quarter but well above the average pace during 
the past two years.  A version of the index that includes only home  purchase transactions 
was up 10 percent in the fourth quarter from the level of a year earlier.  The constant-

quality price index for new homes—which controls for changes in the geographic 
composition of sales, home size, and a few ot her readily measurable attributes—was up 
6.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, a pace similar to the average during 
the past couple of years. 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real business spending on equipment and softwa re (E&S) advanced at an annual rate of 
18 percent in the fourth quarter, according to our current estimate.4  The overall pace of 
E&S spending appears likely to step down in the current quarter, reflecting a decline in 
outlays for motor vehicles.  However, real  E&S spending excluding motor vehicles is on 
track to increase this quarter at a rate that is comparable  to the average rate over the 
previous year.  In addition, investment funda mentals are still accommodative:  Business 
output continues to expand at a brisk pace, fi rms hold large cushions of liquid assets, and 
the cost of capital remains attractive—despit e the expiration of the partial-expensing 
provision—because of low interest rates.  Moreover, anecdotal reports from the Beige 
Book, recent business surveys, and our industry contacts support a favorable outlook for nontransportation capital sp ending in the near term. 
 In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computing equipment accelerated in January, and shipments of communications g ear more than bounced back from their 
December drop.  High-tech orders look fairly  strong as well:  Bookings of computers 
decreased in January but reversed  only part of their previous  months’ advance, and orders 
for communications equipment jumped (although  the signaling conten t in this volatile 
series for future deliveries is quite weak).   The few available revenue projections from 
software vendors for the current quarter poin t to a smaller rise in business spending on 
software than in the fourth quarter.  Outsid e of high-tech, shipment s posted a sizable and 
broad-based increase in January, although the gains were most pronounced in the 
machinery sector.  In addition, the backlog of orders contin ued to increase, pointing to 
further gains in shipments in coming months.  After surging in the second half of last year, busine ss demand for transportation 
equipment appears to have fallen back in the current quarter.  Although fleet sales of light 
vehicles were up in January and February, the much larger retail component of light 
vehicle sales fell sharply over the same period, and we suspect that a portion of this  
                                                
 
4 The BEA’s preliminary estimate of the fourth-quarter increase in real business spending on 
equipment and software did not incorporate revised data on orders and shipments or on international trade 
for December.

decline will show up as reduced purchases by businesses.5  Elsewhere, medium and 
heavy truck sales continued their strong upward trajectory, and the level of new truck 
orders suggests that demand will remain robust in coming months.  Nominal shipments of 
aircraft fell back a bit in January.  Smoot hing through the monthly fluctuations in the 
data, however, domestic demand for aircraft appears to be firming a little after two years of weakness in the wake of  the September 11 attacks. 
 We had previously expected expenditures on equipment and software to decline this 
quarter as a consequence of the terminati on of the partial-expensing tax provision.  
Although a deceleration does seem to be under way, the expiration of partial expensing 
does not appear to be the dominant influence.   Indeed, much of th e apparent deceleration 
is in spending on light vehicles, which pr obably was not greatly affected by the tax 
incentive.  In addition, shipments of long-lived assets in the non-high-tech, 
nontransportation category—whose user co st was reduced the most by the tax 
incentive—moved up in January from their Decemb er level.  All told, if partial expensing 
boosted E&S spending in the second half of last year and depressed it in the current 
quarter, the size of the effect was mu ch smaller than we had anticipated. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Real construction of nonresident ial structures has been about flat in recent months at a 
depressed level.  Outlays in the power  and communications sector and in the 
manufacturing sector have been increasing sin ce the middle of last year.  However, real 
spending on commercial structures, which ha d moved up in the first half of 2004, has 
trended lower since then, even though the v acancy rate for retail buildings has edged 
down in recent quarters and remains at the lo w end of the range observed during the past 
few years.  Office construction has also sli pped further of late, in part because of 
continued high vacancy rates.  The number of  rigs drilling for natural gas edged up in 
January and February, pointing to another in crease in the drilling and mining component 
of outlays for nonresidential structures. 
 
Business Inventories  
We currently estimate that a pickup in real  inventory investment  contributed about 
¾ percentage point to the increase in real GDP  in the fourth quarter, and a similar-sized 
contribution seems possible this quarter.  For the manufacturi ng and trade sector 
excluding motor vehicles, which accounts for 85 percent of total inve ntory stocks, the  
                                                
 
5 On average over the past year, 70 percent of total light vehicle sales to businesses were classified as 
retail sales, and 30 percent were classified as fleet sales.

book value of inventories increased at an annua l rate of $140 billion in January after an 
average $108 billion accumulati on in the fourth quarter.  In January, manufacturers 
accumulated inventories at twice the rate of  the fourth quarter, while wholesalers and 
retailers excluding auto dealers about matc hed the fourth-quarter pace of inventory 
investment. 
 Despite rapid sales growth, the recent pace of  inventory investment has kept inventory-
sales ratios in all three major sectors about fl at since the middle of last year, rather than 
on the downward path that we think characterizes the long er-run trend.  Nevertheless, 
business surveys and reports from our industr y contacts provide littl e evidence that these 
accumulations are unwanted.  In the February  ISM Report on Business, the number of 
respondents stating that their customers’ inventories are too low increased from 
December to February, whereas the number of  respondents stating that they are too high 
decreased.  That said, data from the staff’ s flow-of-goods inventory system indicate that 
inventories remain elevated relative to c onsumption for a few products, including motor 
vehicles, food, and paper.  
Federal Government Sector  
The federal budget situation over the past two m onths is similar to that recorded during 
the same period last year, as both receipts and outlays have post ed large increases.  
According to the Monthly Treasury Statemen t, the federal government recorded a 
cumulative $105 billion deficit in January and February, an amount only a bit higher than 
the $98 billion deficit posted during the comparable months of 2004.    
 Receipts in January and February rose about  9¼ percent from year-earlier levels.  
Increases in income and payroll taxes, booste d in part by recent income gains, were 
sizable.  Individual refunds were  up only a little in January and February.  However, the 
refundable portions of the earned income a nd child tax credits, which are counted as 
outlays rather than as individual refunds, each posted large increases.  According to 
separate IRS data, the total of all these refunds through ear ly March was about 6 percent 
above year-earlier levels.  The average size of  refund checks issued thus far is about $200 
higher than it was last year, although the numbe r of tax returns certified for a refund is 
about 2 percent lower than it was last year.  However, the tax refund season is far from 
over; the total amount of refunds to date is le ss than half of the expected total for the 
entire season.   
 
II-26 
II-27 
Outlays in January and February, adjusted fo r financial transactions and payment timing 
shifts, rose 8½ percent from year-earlier levels.  Outlays increased in all major categories.  
Spending for national defense in January and Fe bruary rose about 5¼ percent, an increase 
consistent with developments in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Medicare spending posted a double-digit rate of increase , while Medicaid expenditure s, which had received a 
temporary increment between mid-2003 and mid-2004 under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, were little changed.  Spending in the “other” category 
picked up noticeably, largely because of variat ion in the timing of payments for programs 
such as the financing of foreign military sales.    President Bush has submitted to the Congress his budget for fiscal 2006.  The Administration expects that, if the Congre ss enacts the supplemental appropriation for 
spending in Iraq that was requested in late  February and the Pr esident’s other policy 
proposals, the unified deficit will reach $427 billion in fiscal 2005, up from $412 billion 
last fiscal year and higher than the CBO ’s most recent estimate of $394 billion.  Under 
these assumptions, the Administra tion projects that the defic it would be cut in half over 
the next five years, to a level of $207 bill ion in 2010.  However, the President’s budget 
submission excluded any significant funding for activities in Iraq and Afghanistan 
beyond that already in train and omitted any bud getary effect of the President’s proposal 
to add personal accounts to Social Security.  The President’s policy proposals that were 
included in the budget would have little effect on the deficit over the next five years, as 
small revenue losses would be offset by sm all spending cuts.  However, the proposals 
would increase the deficit significantly after 2010 because the Administration is 
proposing to extend the tax cuts that are due to expire then. 
 
State and Local Governments  
Recent indicators signal that state and local government finances are improving this year 
and that the sector’s spending is strengthe ning.  Employment rose 31,000 in February, 
with gains primarily at educational establ ishments.  The sector’s employment has now 
risen for eight consecutive months.  Sim ilarly, construction spending, which has been 
increasing since September, rose another 1.4 percent in nominal terms in January.  
Outlays for highways and streets have been  on an unusually steep upward trajectory; 
spending on educational facilities has also tre nded higher.  Together, these two categories 
account for about 60 percent of state and local construction. 
 
News on state finances during the current fiscal year continues to be encouraging; most 
states have reported strong re venue growth month after mont h.  However, many officials

remain concerned about fiscal 2006, which starts July 1 in all but four  states.  According 
to a new survey from the National Conference of  State Legislatures, nearly half the states 
reported that they are projecting budget gaps  in their general f und account for 2006 if no 
corrective budget actions are ta ken.  The prospective shortfalls range from a low of 
0.2 percent of expenditures in  West Virginia to a high of 15 percent in Alaska.  
California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New Yo rk are among the states anticipating large 
budget gaps. 
 
Prices and Labor Costs 
After having held steady in December, prices of consumer goods and services moved up 
in January.  Core consumer prices rose a touc h faster than overall prices, and the increase 
in the core was fairly widespread among commodities and services.  A decline in 
consumer energy prices held down the January  increase in the overa ll price indexes.  
However, gasoline and other energy prices turned  back up in February and early March.   
 
The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 0.2 percent in 
January.  During the twelve months that ende d in January, PCE pri ces rose 2.2 percent, 
boosted by a climb of almost 12 percent in en ergy prices.  PCE prices excluding food and 
energy moved up 0.3 percent in January after increases averaging 0.1 percent per month 
in the fourth quarter.  On a twelve-month basi s, the change in core PCE prices has been 
around 1½ percent sinc e last spring.   
 PCE energy prices fell 1.2 percen t in January, a decrease that  reflected the passthrough of 
the decline in crude oil prices late last year .  However, crude prices  have turned back up 
this year, and survey data suggest that season ally adjusted gasoline prices increased about 
2½ percent in February and will rise even mo re sharply in March.  Higher crude prices 
have also induced some substitution toward na tural gas by industrial users of heavy fuel 
oil, and this substitution has pushed up pri ces of natural gas a little despite ample 
inventories for this time of year.       PCE prices for food were flat in January, as they were held down by substantial declines 
in prices for fruits and vegetables.  Thes e prices continued to reverse their earlier, 
hurricane-related run-ups, but w holesale prices of fruits and vegetables suggest that this 
adjustment has now largely run its course.  
Within the core PCE price index, goods prices rose 0.4 percent in January.  Prices of new 
motor vehicles climbed appreciably, as sales incen tives fell further.  Price increases were

fairly widespread among other goods as well.  Prices of core consumer services moved 
up 0.2 percent in January, about in line with the average increase seen  over the previous 
few months.  The January uptick in core PCE inflation was apparent in both the market-
based and the non-market-based components of  the index.  On a twelve-month change 
basis, inflation in core PCE services has trended down consistently  for the past three 
years.  However, inflation in core PCE goods  prices has moved sharply higher since late 
2003 apparently as a result of higher import pr ices, the indirect e ffects of higher energy 
prices, and higher prices for core  intermediate materials.   
 
The twelve-month change in the core CPI was 2.3 percent over the year ending in 
January, a pickup of 1.2 percentage points from a year earlier.  The greater acceleration in 
the CPI compared with the PCE price index can be traced in large part to its different 
treatment of medical services.  The PCE medical services index includes some 
components (for example, Medicare and Medi caid reimbursements) that are not covered 
in the CPI.6  In addition, PCE medical services pr ices are mostly derived from producer 
price indexes rather than from the CPIs.  B ecause of these differences in scope and data 
sources, the CPI for medical services acceler ated 0.7 percentage point in the twelve 
months ending in January, while the PCE for medical services decelerated 1.6 percentage 
points. 
 
According to the final rel ease of the Michigan Survey for February, the median 
expectation for inflation over the next year was 2.9 percent, the same reading as in 
January and a little below its fourth-quarter average.  The median expectation for 
inflation over the next five to ten years was 2.8 percent, roughly the average reported 
over the past several years.  Regarding producer prices, the PPI for capital  equipment jumped 0.6 percent in January. 
The January increase brought the twelve-month change in prices for capital equipment to 
2.8 percent, almost 2 percentage  points greate r than the change in the preceding year.  
The PPI for core intermediate materials c limbed 0.8 percent in January after several 
months of somewhat smaller increases.  Th e January advance leaves these prices  
8½ percent higher than they we re a year earlier; rising pr ices for energy and imported 
materials and rising rates of  capacity utilization can e xplain much of that run-up, 
although the acceleration is larger than our m odels that incorporate these factors would 
predict.  
                                                
 
6 Because of this difference in scop e, medical care has a much larger weight in the PCE index than in 
the CPI.

Prices for core crude materials fell 2½ percent in January after a 1¼ percent decline in 
December.  However, prices for industrial me tals (aside from steel scrap) have been 
increasing in recent weeks, and the Journal of Commerce metals index is up 4¾ percent 
since the January Greenbook.  Among the othe r commodity indexes that exclude energy, 
the CRB spot industrials inde x has risen 4½ percent since the last Greenbook, and the 
CRB spot foodstuffs index has risen 3¼ percen t.  The JOC industrial index and the CRB 
futures index, both of which contain a subs tantial energy compone nt, have moved up 
4½ percent and 12 percent respectively. 
 
Average hourly earnings were flat in Februa ry after a 0.3 percent ga in in January.  They 
rose 2½ percent during the twelve months endi ng in February, about 1 percentage point 
faster than in the preceding year.   The BE A estimates that compensation per hour in the 
nonfarm business sector moved up 4.2 percent last  year, compared with an increase of 
5.3 percent in the preceding year. 7  The markup of prices over unit labor costs remained 
somewhat higher than the long-term norm fo r both the nonfarm business sector (through 
the fourth quarter) and the nonfinancial cor porate sector (through th e third quarter, the 
latest quarter for which data are available).

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
During the intermeeting period, investors focu sed on Federal Reserve statements that 
suggested continued tightening of monetary policy and on in coming data that pointed to 
sustained economic growth and the possible emergence of infl ationary pressure.  Market 
participants shifted up the anticipated path for the federal funds rate, and nominal 
Treasury yields rose sharply across the yiel d curve, accompanied by significant increases 
in inflation compensation.  Despite the higher interest rates and oil prices, stock prices 
edged up and spreads on corporate bonds narrowed, especially for speculative-grade 
firms.  In recent months, the pace of to tal net business borrowing has quickened, and 
household borrowing has remained brisk. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision at the February FOMC meeting to increase the federa l funds rate target 
25 basis points and to retain the “measured pa ce” language matched market expectations.  
However, investors marked up their policy expe ctations in the wake of several events, 
including higher-than-expected readings on inflation, increases in oil prices, and the 
Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, which was interpreted as indicating no imminent 
pause in monetary tightening.  The release of  the minutes of the February FOMC meeting 
the week after the monetary policy testim ony prompted little market reaction.  The 
market has now fully priced in 75 basis poi nts of cumulative tightening over the next 
three FOMC meetings.  Uncertainty about the future path of policy was about unchanged 
over the intermeeting period. 
 The yield on the two-year Treasury note  rose by about 50 basis points over the 
intermeeting period, while the ten-year yi eld increased 40 basis points.  Market 
expectations for faster inflati on likely contributed to the ri se in yields, especially at 
shorter maturities.  Five-year TIPS-based in flation compensation increased about 35 basis 
points amid the higher-than-expected infla tion data and rising oil prices; although 
inflation compensation over the subsequent five years only edge d up, the front-loaded 
rise still implies a 25 basis point increase over a ten-year period.  Upward pressures on 
the ten-year yield also may have been amplified by the Chairman’s remark in his 
semiannual testimony that the then-prevailing lo w level of long-term interest rates was a 
“conundrum.”    
Corporate Yields, Risk Spreads, and Stock Prices 
Broad equity price indexes rose on net by le ss than 1 percent over the intermeeting period 
after touching four-year highs in early March, as generally positive earnings news and a

continued flow of merger announcements offset  the effects of highe r long-term interest 
rates and oil prices.  Energy -related and basic materials st ocks posted especially large 
gains in response to the recent run-up in th e prices of oil and other commodities, while 
the remainder of the market edged down.  The gap between the trend-adjusted forward 
earnings-price ratio and the re al perpetuity Treasury yi eld was little changed and 
remained near its long-term average a nd well below its recent high in early 2003.1  Both 
implied and realized volati lities on the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have stayed near 
historical lows.   Yields on investment-grade bonds moved up a bit less than comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields over the intermeeting period a nd spreads fell a touch.  Spreads on high-
yield bonds narrowed considerably more—roughl y 50 basis points.  The implied risk 
premium for high-yield spreads based on the staff’s model of expected defaults and 
recoveries is now quite narrow and near levels  last seen in 1997.  The quality spread on 
commercial paper has remained low. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With fourth-quarter reports in hand from vi rtually all of the S&P 500 firms, earnings per 
share are estimated to have risen roughly 19 perc ent relative to a year earlier, a pace that 
continues the solid growth reco rded over the past few years.  Revisions to forecasts of 
year-ahead earnings were slightly positive on net in February and early March, a 
reflection of upward revisions for energy firms.   Net revisions excluding these firms were 
slightly negative and similar to their levels in recent months. 
 Credit quality for nonfinancial firms remains strong.  Aggregate cash  positions are still 
very large, although they appear to have tick ed down in the fourth quarter because of 
Microsoft’s special divide nd and Cingular’s cash-fina nced acquisition of AT&T 
Wireless.  The value of bond upgrades exceeded bond downgrades in January and 
February.  Meanwhile, the six-month trailing bond default rate, which edged up in recent 
months, remains at a modest level, and the C& I loan delinquency rate  continued to trend 
downward in the fourth quarter.  Firm-level es timates by KMV as of January indicate that 
the aggregate expected year-ahead default rate has remained low. 
                                                
 
1 The unadjusted  forward earnings-price ratio, which we have presented previously in the Greenbook 
as a rough estimate of the expected real return on the S&P 500, has a cy clical bias.  In particular, when 
twelve-month-ahead (forward) earnings are above trend, as in recent months, the ratio is biased upward, 
and vice versa when earnings are below trend.  The tr end-adjusted forward earnings-price ratio uses the 
estimated trend component of forward earnings per sh are in place of actual forward earnings per share to 
eliminate this cyclical bias.

Business Finance 
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial cor porations in February and early March 
maintained the relatively slow pace seen in January and was held down by limited 
offerings from investment-grade firms.  In contrast, speculative-grade issuance remained 
brisk, similar to the pace last year, and the share of issuance by the weaker firms in this 
group—those rated B minus and below—has pick ed up this year.  Nevertheless, in 
contrast to 1997 and the firs t half of 1998, speculative-grade issuers are reportedly still 
largely using the proceeds to refinance th eir existing debt—and thereby improve their 
balance sheets—rather than to  fund expansion.  With regard to shorter-term borrowing, 
commercial paper and C&I loans expanded furthe r in February, albeit at a more moderate 
pace than in January.  Overall, net debt fi nancing from these sources in the current 
quarter is on a somewhat stronger track th an it was in the se cond half of 2004, but it 
remains moderate.  Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms through mid-March stayed at the moderate pace 
recorded last year.  IPOs have accounted fo r the bulk of issuance this year, as seasoned 
offerings have continued to be muted by firms’ low leverage and ample cash.  
Completions of share repurchases, which we re fueled by strong pr ofits and substantial 
liquid assets, rose from an already elevated ra te to a record pace in  the fourth quarter.  
Cash-financed mergers jumped as well, in pa rt because of the merger of Cingular and 
AT&T Wireless.  For the first quarter, announ cements of share repurchases and merger 
activity have been strong but have not matche d the torrid pace of the fourth quarter.   
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt rose  at a 12½ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, and a 
full CMBS calendar suggests so lid growth in the current quarter.  Investment-grade 
CMBS spreads over the ten-year Treasury yi eld are still narrow.  Delinquency rates on 
loans backing CMBS have fallen almost 1 percen tage point on net since their peak in late 
2003, and those on commercial mortgages on the books of banks and life insurance 
companies remain quite low.  The ratio of net operating income to property prices—an 
indicator of the rate of return on commercial real estate—declined further in the fourth 
quarter.  The spread of this ratio over the r eal perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough measure 
of the risk premium on commercial real esta te assets, widened somewhat in the fourth 
quarter but remained in the lower part of  the range observed over the past decade.

quarter.  Although interest rate s on thirty-year fixed-rate mo rtgages have risen in recent 
weeks, they remain low and should contribute  to strong mortgage debt growth in the 
current quarter.  Consumer credit posted anothe r moderate gain in the fourth quarter and 
picked up a bit in January. 
 The household financial obligations ratio decl ined in the fourth quarter because an 
increase in required debt payments was more th an offset by a spike in disposable personal 
income stemming from Microsoft’s special dividend payment.  Without the Microsoft 
dividend, the financial obligations  ratio would have edged up to  its highest value in more 
than a year.  Even so, measures of house hold credit quality have remained strong.  At 
commercial banks, delinquency rates on cred it card loans were about unchanged, and 
rates on residential mortgages declined in the fourth quart er.  In addition, delinquency 
rates on auto loans at captive finance co mpanies remained low in January, and 
bankruptcy filings thus far in the year have continued to run below their year-ago levels.  
However, filings may surge in coming months if the bankruptcy bill now working its way 
through the Congress becomes law.

 The ratio of household net worth to disposable  personal income incr eased in the fourth 
quarter; the lift came from solid gains in both equity and house prices.  Although stock 
prices were little changed on net in January and February, equity mutual fund inflows in 
these months maintained the strong pace seen in the fourth quarter.  
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Treasury borrowing has continued to expand at a steady pace in recent months.  Indirect 
bidding at recent Treasury auctions—a rough proxy for demand from foreign official 
institutions—has remained generally strong.  Treasury securities he ld in custody at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) on behalf of foreign official institutions 
resumed their robust growth with an increa se of about $22 billion over the intermeeting 
period. 
 Fannie Mae’s stock price declined in respons e to both the revelation of more accounting 
irregularities at the company and Chairman Gr eenspan’s remarks about the desirability of  
                                                
 
2 This bill, which has been passed by the Senate but not yet by the House, would make it more difficult 
for households to discharge their debts through chapter 7 filings.  The tougher standards would take effect 
180 days after the President signs the bill and so coul d spur a rush to file in the intervening months.

the size of the housing GSEs’ investment portf olios.  However, credit spreads for the 
GSEs remain very low amid reduced issuan ce as well as continue d strong demand from 
foreign official institutions, as judged by FRBNY custody holdings. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds was rapid in Fe bruary.  Advance refundings 
were boosted by municipalities ta king advantage of a temporar y dip in long-term rates, 
while new capital issuance continued to be  supported by projects related to higher 
education.  In contrast, short-term issuan ce was muted, likely because of the stronger 
budget situation in many states.  Credit quality  continued to improve, as upgrades of 
municipal bonds far outpaced downgrades.  Municipal bond yields increased, and the 
ratio of long-term municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields was 
about unchanged in recent weeks.   
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 growth averaged about 2½ pe rcent at an annual rate over the first two months of the 
year, about half of the fourth -quarter pace.  The weaker growth was concentrated in 
liquid deposits, likely the result  of the higher opportunity co sts associated with holding 
such deposits.  In contrast, small time deposits , whose rates typically align more closely 
with market rates, expanded rapidly in January and February.  The ongoing runoff in 
money market funds also contributed to the slow M2 growth; inve stors evidently found 
bond and equity funds an attractive a lternative to money market funds. 
 
Bank credit growth has picked  up sharply this year to an  average annual rate of  
17 percent in January and February.  A jump  in holdings of securities, particularly 
agency-related mortgage-backed securities, a ccounted for a bit more  than half of the 
expansion.  Loan growth was also brisk, with  business and real esta te loans posting solid 
increases.

In January, the value of exports of goods and services increased 0.4 percent.  Exports of 
automotive products were strong, due to si zable growth in ex ports to non-NAFTA 
countries.  However, most ot her categories of goods exports  showed modest declines.  
Among capital goods, telecommunications equi pment was the only category that 
exhibited an increase, with computers, semi conductors, aircraft, and other capital goods 
all declining.  Exports of i ndustrial supplies fell slightly, while consumer goods retreated 
a bit from an extremely robust December. 
 
In December, the value of exports of goods and services jumped 3.2 percent after falling 
almost 1 percent in November.  The export figures for November were revised up more 
than $1.5 billion, largely on account of a correctio n to data provided by Statistics Canada, 
which are used to measure U.S. exports to Canada.  In the fourth quarter, exports of 
goods and services climbed 8¼ percent at an annual rate.  The increase was widespread, 
with the exception of expor ts of automotive products, which fell in the quarter. 
 The value of imported goods and services in creased 1.9 percent in January.  A large 
decline in the value of imported oil was more th an offset by a sharp increase in imports of 
non-oil goods.  Services imports also incr eased smartly.  The rise in non-oil goods

imports was widespread across categories, wi th notable increases in consumer goods and 
automotive products.  Within capital goods, de clines in the imports of computers, 
telecommunication equipment, and aircraft we re more than offset  by large gains in 
semiconductors and other capital goods. 
 The value of imported goods and services was little changed in December, as a large decline in the value of importe d oil offset an increase in non -oil imports.  In the fourth 
quarter, nominal imports of goods and servic es increased just ove r 20 percent at an 
annual rate, with the increase roughly split in half between oil and non-oil imports.  
Within non-oil imports, most broad categorie s recorded gains, w ith the exception of 
automotive products which fell.  
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In January, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core 
goods rose 0.2 and 0.4 percent, respectively.  Hi gher prices for capital goods (excluding 
computers and semiconductors) and consumer goods were the main contributors to the 
price increase.  For capital goods, the Janua ry price increase of 0.8 percent was the 
largest one-month change r ecorded since May 1995.  The price index for imported 
industrial supplies in creased only 0.1 percen t in January, held down by an 8.3 percent 
decline in natural gas prices.  Other categories of indus trial supplies had notable price 
increases; for example, prices of building ma terials and chemicals each rose by just over 
2 percent.  Prices for imported automotive products and foods, feeds and beverages fell 
0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively, in Janua ry.  Prices of imported computers 
fell 1.4 percent, whereas prices for semiconductors edged up.

Texas Intermediate crude rose 8.1 percent in  January, averaging about $46.80 per barrel.  
Although the average spot price in February was only about $1 per barrel higher, the spot 
price began to rise late in the month and closed on March 15 at $55.05 per barrel.  The 
increase in oil prices is a reaction in part to oil demand that is stronger than was 
previously anticipated and re marks by OPEC that imply the cartel is targeting a higher 
level of oil prices.  In add ition, concerns about future supp lies from Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, 
Venezuela, and Russia also continue to  support oil prices.  On March 16, OPEC 
announced a 500,000 barrel per day increase in its  production target, but  this had little 
IV-6 
immediate impact on prices.  Subsequently, o il prices surged to new record highs in 
intraday trading after the re lease of lower-than-expected  U.S. oil inventory data. 
 
Exports.  In January, the prices of U.S. expor ts of total goods and of core goods 
increased 0.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively.  Much of January’s rise was due to a 
1.5 percent increase in prices of  industrial supplies, reflecti ng higher prices for chemicals 
and petroleum products.  In addition, export prices of cap ital goods (excluding computers 
and semiconductors) and consumer goods rose 0.7 and 0.6 percent, respectively.  Prices 
for agricultural product s and automotive products both increased 0.3 percent.  For both 
computers and semiconductors, expo rt prices fell in January. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
Foreign private demand for U.S. securities ( line 4 of the Summary of  U.S. International 
Transactions table) continued strong in both December and January.  In each month there 
were substantial net acquisitions of agen cy (line 4b) and corporate (line 4c) debt 
securities, continuing recent trends.  January saw the hi ghest level of foreign net 
purchases of equities (line 4d) recorded in several years.  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. 
Treasuries (line 4a) were flat  in December but picked up sharply in January.  For the 
fourth quarter as a whole, net private infl ows were above the yearly average; for 2004, 
net purchases were the highest yet record ed and well above the 2003 level.  During 2004 
foreign investors acquired Treasur ies, corporate debt, and equiti es at about the same pace 
as the preceding year and return ed to acquiring agency debt af ter selling these securities 
during 2003.  
 Net foreign official inflows ( line 1) continued at about thei r yearly average in December 
at $30 billion, but fell to $19 billion in Janua ry.  
.  Net inflows during the fourth quarter remained high and 
in line with recent quarters; for the year, ne t official inflows were almost 50 percent 
larger than the previous year's record of $250 billion, owing in part to substantial first-
quarter inflows.  Partial data from the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York indicate a large 
increase in reserve assets during February and early March, w ith the largest inflows from 
China and Russia.   
 
U.S. investors acquired foreign equities (line 5b) at an unusually high rate in December 
before returning to more normal levels in January, while recorded net purchases of 

IV-7 
foreign debt securities (line 5a) in Decem ber were offset by net sales in January.  
Although net U.S. acquisitions of foreign secu rities (line 5) were well above average 
during the fourth quarter, for the year they were only slightly above those recorded in 
2003 and resulted almost entirely from in creased holdings of foreign equities.  
 
During both 2002 and 2003 net inflows from foreign official institutions  (primarily into 
securities) combined with foreign private pur chases of U.S. securities exceeded U.S. 
acquisitions of foreign securities by sligh tly over $500 billion.  For 2004, this same 
calculation results in a net inflow of over $700 billion.  The volatile banking sector (l ine 3) recorded a modest inflow in December and a 
substantial outflow of $68 billion in January.  For the year, the banking sector recorded a 
modest net outflow.   Full balance of payments data for the fourth quarter, including direct investment, will be released March 16 and included in the Greenbo ok Supplement.  U.S. direct investment 
abroad is expected to show a large increas e during the fourth quarter resulting from the 
re-incorporation in the United St ates of News Corporation Lt d. (Australia), the Rupert 
Murdoch controlled media conglomerate va lued at nearly $60 billion.  The re-
incorporation itself does not represent a net fi nancial inflow.  The positive entry that will 
appear in the direct investment account will be offset elsewhere, most likely by stock 
swaps reducing the value of U.S. portfolio assets abroad and increasing the value of 
foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign currencies 
declined 2.4 percent on net over the intermeeting peri od.  The dollar appreciated for 
several days following the Chairman’s speech on February 4, which many analysts interpreted as reflecting a redu ced level of concern about the large and rising U.S. current 
account deficit.  However, that move was quickly reversed.  The dollar’s subsequent 
decline appeared to be linked in part to ne ws stories and official statements, sometimes 
contradictory, about the intent of several Asian monetary auth orities, including Japan and 
Korea, to alter the currency composition of their foreign reserves.  Late in the period, 
renewed investor concerns about the financi ng burden associated with the U.S. current 
account deficit again appeared  to weigh on the dollar. 
                  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciate d against all other ma jor currencies over the 
period, with the exception of the Japanese yen.  The dollar depreciated 3 percent, on net, 
against the euro, despite lackluster economi c data in the euro area and a downward 
revision of the European Central Bank’s economic growth forecast for 2005.  A news report late in the period that the ECB’s Gove rning Council viewed its  current policy rate 
as “well below” its own estimate of a neutra l monetary policy stan ce boosted the euro’s 
exchange value.  The dollar also declined  2.3 percent versus sterling and 3.5 percent

against the Swiss franc.  In contrast, the dollar was little changed on net against the yen 
amid continued concerns about the pace of Japanese economic activity.  Sharp increases 
in the prices of crude oil, industrial metals, and some agricultural commodities over the period were thought to have also  contributed to the deprecia tion of the dollar against the 
Canadian and Australian currencies.                     Short-term interest rates were little change d on balance over the period in the euro area, 
Canada, and Japan.  Three-month rates rose  11 basis points in the United Kingdom, in 
part as the minutes of the February meeti ng of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy 
Committee showed some willingness to consider a rate increase.  Three-month Australian 
interest rates rose 36 basis points.  The Re serve Bank of Australia increased its main 
policy rate 25 basis points on March 2, to 5.50 percent, and the Reserve Bank of New 
Zealand also raised its polic y rate 25 basis points, to 6.75 percent, on March 10.  Both 
central banks cited concerns ove r inflationary pressures as a factor in their decisions.  
Ten-year sovereign yields rose substantially in all industrial countri es over the period, led 
by the United States, reflecting in part an uptic k in expected future inflation shown in the 
price of inflation-indexed bonds.  Benchmark no minal yields rose about 20 basis points in 
the United Kingdom, the euro area, and Japa n.  Headline equity indexes rose about 1 Financial Indicators in Major Industrial Countries

The dollar was little changed on a trade-weight ed basis against the cu rrencies of our other 
important trading partners, on balance over the period.  The dollar rose less than 1 
percent against the Mexican peso but, in c ontrast, appreciated 5.5 percent against the 
Brazilian real, as Brazil’s central bank sold financ ial derivatives designed to weaken its 
currency.  The dollar depreciated about 2 perc ent against the Korean won and the Taiwan 
dollar despite (unconfirmed) reports of in tervention activity by the respective central 
banks to dampen their currencies’ strength.  Equity prices generall y rose throughout Latin 
America and Asia, reflecting the perception that economic conditions are improving in a 
IV-12 
number of emerging market c ountries.  Brazil’s main equ ity index rose 13 percent, 
touching a record high, amid reports of large capital infl ows from foreign private 
investors.  Korean equity pr ices rose 8 percent, with sh ares of “old economy” firms 
outperforming those of the technology sector .  Latin American dollar-denominated bond 
spreads ended the period little changed, on net, after declining to multi-year lows in early 
March.  The spreads rose in the last days of the intermeeting period, reportedly amid 
concerns that higher U.S. Treas ury yields would make carry trades into emerging market 
bonds less attractive to in ternational investors.  Argentina’ s offer to exchange much of its 
defaulted sovereign debt for new issues wa s accepted by investors holding 76 percent of 
the eligible bonds, which was widely seen as a success for the Argentine government.  
The new bonds, to be formally issued on April 1, were trading on the when-issued market 
at a spread of about 550 basis points over Trea suries, compared with spreads in the 4000 
to 6000 basis point range for the old debt. 
IV-13 
Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Data on fourth-quarter GDP in the major fo reign economies confirm that a widespread 
decline in net exports led to a general slow down in the pace of economic activity in the 
second half of 2004.  Japanese output rose slig htly after two quarter s of contraction but 
growth was lackluster as imports surged a nd consumption remained weak.  The euro-area 
economy continued to lose steam as real GDP  fell in Germany and Italy.  In Canada, a 
decrease in exports for the second consecutive  quarter contributed to  a slowing of output 
growth.  The U.K economy, in contrast, expand ed at a robust rate, as strong domestic 
demand more than offset the negative contribution of net exports.  Leading indicators for the current quarter ar e generally positive, pointing to a broad 
pickup in growth.  Industrial production rose br iskly in Japan and continued to increase in 
the major euro-area economies.  Retail sales posted strong gains in Japan and the United 
Kingdom, and firmed in the euro area.  Consumer price inflation remained subdued.  In the euro area, the rate of change of the 
harmonized inflation index edged slightly a bove the ECB’s ceiling in February, following 
a substantial drop in January.  In the Un ited Kingdom and Canada, consumer prices 
continued rising at moderate rates.  Mild deflation persisted in Japan. 
 In Japan , revised data show that real GDP ro se 0.5 percent during the fourth quarter, 
following two consecutive quarters of negativ e growth.  Fourth-quarter growth was 
depressed by a 1 percent decline in persona l consumption.  Business fixed investment 
was roughly flat, while government investment fell almost 2 percent.  Exports accelerated 
from their anemic third-quarter pace, rising 5 percent, but were outpaced by a jump in 
imports.  As a result, net exports subtract ed 0.4 percentage point from growth.  An 
increase in inventories added nearly 1 per centage point to growth.  Nominal GDP rose 
0.1 percent from the previous quarter.  The GDP deflator was down 0.4 percent from its 
year-ago level, the smallest decline since 1998, as  the PCE deflator fell only a little from 
a year ago and the government consumpti on deflator rose nearly 1 percent. 
 A stream of positive data releases recently points to further strengthening in the first quarter.  Retail sales and household expenditu res posted near-record monthly gains in 
January.  Industrial production rose 2.5 percent in January, a nd inventories of high-tech 
goods eased back from recent highs.  The ma nufacturing PMI moved up in February.

Real exports rose 3 percent in January from th eir fourth-quarter aver age, but real imports 
also rose strongly.  Housing star ts also registered a strong st art to the first quarter.  In 
addition, measures of business confidence tu rned up in January and February, following 
several consecutive months of declines.  However, core machinery orders, a leading 
indicator of business investment, gave back so me of their fourth-quarter gains in January. 
 In February, the Diet  passed a FY2004 s upplementary budget allocating an extra ¥1.2 
trillion (0.2 percent of GDP) for public works projects related to damage caused by last 
October’s earthquake.  Labor market conditions continued to improve , but deflation persisted.  In January, the 
unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent and employment  surged.  The job-offers-to-
applicants ratio, a leading indi cator of employment, returned to the thirteen-year high hit 
in November.  Nominal wages continued to fall through December, dragged down by 
sharp cuts in winter bonuses in the services sector.  Core consumer goods prices in the 
Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but incl ude energy) rose 0.1 percent in February 
from the previous month, and were down 0.5 percent from a year earlier.  Wholesale 
price inflation eased markedly in the early months of this year.

Euro-area  real GDP continued to decelerate in the fourth quarter, rising just 0.6 percent.  
Net exports made a negative contribution for the second consecutive quarter as imports 
grew faster than exports.  Final domestic  demand rose 1.7 percent, supported by solid 
growth in consumption and especially in investment.  The change in inventories 
subtracted 0.4 percentage point  from growth.  At the country  level, the pace of economic 
activity continued to diverge: GDP rose r obustly in France and Spain, while it fell in 
Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.  Incoming data suggest a limited pickup in growth  in the first quarter.  Euro-area retail 
sales rose 0.3 percent in Ja nuary from the previous month.  In January, industrial 
production surged in Germany and continued to rise in France.  Euro-area manufacturing 
and services PMIs moved up a bit in January and February, on average, from the fourth-
quarter level.  In contrast, the European Co mmission’s index of business sentiment fell in 
February to its lowest level since March 2004.  The fall was widespread across all sectors 
of the economy, except for consumer confid ence that was flat.  In Germany, the IFO 
index rose in January but edged down in February.

Labor market conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate 
unchanged at 8.8 percent in January.  In Germany, the unemployment rate increased to 11.7 percent in February, a substantial jump  from the 10.8 percent rate recorded in 
December.  However, according to the Germ an Federal Statistical Office, the recent 
surge in measured unemployment is mostly attributable to the implementation of the 
Hartz IV laws, as welfare re cipients able to work now are counted as unemployed. 
 The twelve-month rate of consumer price infla tion in the euro area dropped to 1.9 percent 
in January but edged up to 2.1 percent, above the ECB’s ceiling, in February.  Prices of 
both manufactured goods and services contribut ed to the moderation of the headline 
inflation rate since last year.  Within manufactured goods, most of the moderation is 
explained by a favorable base effect as the sharp hike in tobacco prices in January 2004 
was not repeated in January of this year.  Similarly, in servic es, the effect of last year’s 
German health care reform fell out of the cal culation of inflation.  Energy prices edged 
down in January and February, on average, wi th respect to the fourth-quarter level.

House prices remained almost flat over the f ourth quarter.  However, since the beginning 
of this year, they have begun to rise again.  According to the Halifax index, house prices 
have increased around 6 percent at an annual rate over the three-month period ending in 
February.  Household net mortgage borrowing rose in both December and January but is 
still about 20 percen t below its 2003 peak. 
 
Business confidence has recovered solidly from its slump in the fourth quarter.  Consumer confidence, however, has remain ed unchanged at a level of zero, which 
separates positive from negative sentiment.  The PMI for both services and construction fell slightly in February while the PMI for manufacturing remained unchanged.  All three 
surveys continue to indicate expansion.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price infl ation stayed at 1.6 percent in January, well 
below the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target.  In its February Inflation Report,  the Bank 
of England forecast inflation, using market exp ectations for interest rates, to edge just 
above the target at a two-year horizon. 
 
In Canada , real GDP growth slowed to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter , as exports fell 
sharply for the second consecutive quarter.  Exports decreased in virtually all goods 
categories as the appreciation of the Canadian  dollar over the past tw o years seems to be 
exerting strong downward pressure on extern al demand.  Imports continued to grow 
strongly, and net exports subtract ed 4.7 percentage points from growth.  In contrast, final 
domestic demand continued to accelerate.  Bu siness investment growth reached its fastest 
pace of the year, while consumption also re gistered a healthy advance.  Inventory 
accumulation was large for the second consecutive quarter.

Domestic demand appears to have remained healthy in the early part of 2005.  Housing 
starts remained strong in January and Fe bruary.  The composite index of leading 
indicators rose again in Janua ry, the second consecutive monthly advance since growth in 
the index stalled in November.  The sub-inde x for retail trade con tinued to advance in 
January, although more slowly than  in the previous few months.  
 
The manufacturing sector, which is heavily export-oriented, was hard-hit during the third 
and fourth quarters of 2004.  However, indicators suggest a pickup at the turn of the year.

In January, both new orders and shipments su rged, as nearly ever y sub-sector posted

On February 23, the government released a new budget plan that  includes roughly C$42 
billion (about 3 percent of GD P) in new spending initiative s over the next five years and 
projects a surplus of C$4 b illion for 2005-2006.  Further new initiatives are expected to 
be consistent with budgets that are balanced or in surplus, with the goal of reducing the 
federal debt-to-GDP ratio, over the next ten year s, to 25 percent from the current level of 
41 percent.  
 The labor market was little changed thr ough the first two months of 2005, with the 
unemployment rate steady at 7 percent.  In addition, both total and manufacturing 
employment were flat, on averag e, in January and February.   
 In January, the twelve-month ra te of consumer price infla tion moderated to 2 percent, 
although gasoline prices moved up.   The twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding 
the eight most volatile components, also decl ined slightly in Ja nuary to 1.6 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data suggest that economic performan ce in emerging Asia has been mixed.  While 
Chinese industrial production fell and Ko rean growth remained subdued, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, and the ASEAN countries registered so me gains.  In Latin America, Mexico and 
Argentina experienced solid performances, while Brazilian indicators pointed to a 
slowdown in activity.  Consumer  prices in developing countr ies have remained stable, 
suggesting that higher oil prices have only had a modest impact on inflation. 
 Chinese  industrial production fell significantly in January, after a strong fourth quarter.  
Average imports for January and February were  down sharply from four th-quarter levels.  
Given the shifting of the Chinese New Year holiday between January and February in 
different years, seasonal adjustment of data  for the first few months of the year is 
difficult.  The contractions  in production and imports may reflect residual seasonal 
factors, or they could reflect  weakness in the Chinese ec onomy associated with slowing 
investment growth.  The contraction of imports  led to a big increase in the trade surplus 
for January.  Twelve-month consumer price in flation slowed in January, as food prices 
continued to decline, but rose to about 4 percent in February.

Taiwanese  real GDP grew just over 2 percent in th e fourth quarter.  Weak exports held 
down overall growth, but domestic demand was st rong.  Indicators of first-quarter growth 
have been mixed.  Industrial production was up in January.  The trade surplus is positive 
for the year to date, largely due to a dec line in imports of el ectronic components.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation is a li ttle less than 2 percent, about where it was

Economic growth in Korea  remains subdued, led primarily by the export sector.  
Production was up significantly in January, with particular strength in high-tech products 
such as semiconductors and communication e quipment, and exports were up further on 
average in January and February relative to the fourth quarter.  However, retail sales 
continued to trend down through January.  One br ight spot is the f act that both business 
and consumer sentiment has improved.  Also, credit card delinquency ratios have 
continued to decline, sugges ting that the restraint on spe nding from high consumer debt 
may be abating.  Twelve-month consumer pr ice inflation, both headline and core, was 
around 3¼ percent in February, within the gove rnment’s target range of 2.5-3.5 percent 
for core inflation.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries indicate that economic activity expanded at a 
solid pace in the fourth quarter.  The excepti on is the Philippines, where fourth-quarter 
growth was lowered by the adverse effects of natural disasters on the agricultural sector.  
The Singapore electronics PMI rose in January and February, after fall ing in the previous 
three months, suggesting expansion in economic activity going forward.  Recent trade data for the ASEAN economies have been mixed.  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore 
continued to run trade surpluses, although the surplus for Singapore decreased in January.  
In the Philippines and Thailand, th e trade balance turned negative. 
 Consumer price inflation remained elevat ed in Indonesia and the Philippines and 
moderate elsewhere in the region.  Nonethel ess, governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and 
Thailand have recently allowed more increases in  the domestic prices of subsidized fuel.

In Mexico , recent data releases point to a soli d pickup in economic activity.  Real GDP 
rose 5.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth qua rter, above market expectations.  Domestic 
demand was the main source of growth duri ng the quarter, as suggested by the strong 
performance in retail sales, services, and c onstruction activities, aided by increasing bank 
credit despite relatively high real interest rates.  Solid  manufacturing exports—mainly 
maquiladora  exports to the United States—also cont ributed to the strong fourth-quarter 
performance.  High oil revenues have conti nued to allow government spending to provide 
further stimulus to the economy.  In late February the Bank of Mexico tighten ed monetary policy for the eleventh time in 
the past year in an ongoing effort to tame inflation and signal its commitment to its 
inflation target.  Twelve-month inflation stood at 4.3 percent in February, down from 
5.2 percent at the end of 2004 but still above the target range of 2-4 percent.  This 
reduction in inflation suggests that the Bank of  Mexico's aggressive tightening stance is 
beginning to bear fruit, aided by d eclines of food and energy prices.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook have pointed to a slowdown.  Fourth-
quarter real GDP rose 1.7 per cent (a.r.), down from 4.4 percen t in the third quarter and 
from 6½ percent in the first half of 2004.  The fourth-quarter result was driven by a 
15 percent fall in investment that anal ysts believe was temporary and private 
consumption continued to show strength, growing 5½ percent.  Industrial production 
declined ½ percent in Janua ry, while average vehicle pr oduction over January-February 
was roughly flat, after having risen over 20 pe rcent in 2004.  Despite the appreciation of 
the real against the dollar during the past months, Brazil continue d to record a sizeable 
trade surplus.  Monthly CPI inflation declined from 0.8 per cent in December to 0.6 percent in February, 
bringing the twelve-month increase down to 7.4 percent.  Twelve-month-ahead expected 
inflation from the central bank’s survey has fallen from 6.3 percent la st October to about 
5½ percent.  Nevertheless, in mid-February, th e central bank raised its policy rate for the 
sixth consecutive month, to 18.75 percent.  The central bank has expressed concerns 
about the inflation outlook, in part becau se of sizeable incr eases in government-
administered fuels prices in late 2004.  The central bank has been aiming to reduce 
inflation to about 5 percent by the end of 2005.

In Argentina , the economic recovery continued in the third quarter, with real GDP and 
industrial production growing at annual rates of 12 and 11 percent, respectively.  Growth 
appears to have slowed somewhat in the four th quarter, as industrial production increased 
at an annual rate of 8.5 percen t.  The unemployment rate has steadily fallen over the past 
few years, reaching about 12 percent in the four th quarter, half of what it was at the peak 
of the 2001-02 financial crisis.  The trade surplus has narrowed in recent months.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation rose to  just over 8 percent in  February, slightly 
above the central bank’s unoffici al target range of 5 to 8 percent inflation for end-2005. 
 The government launched its long- awaited debt restructuring in mid-January.  The debt 
swap offer closed on February 25, and prelimin ary results indicate that private investors 
holding $62 billion out of a total $82 b illion in defaulted bonds accepted the 
government’s offer, for a global participation ra te of 76 percent.  Af ter the transaction is 
settled, Argentina’s total public debt is exp ected to fall by $67 billion to $125 billion 
(equivalent to about 72 percent of GDP), 37 percent of which will be denominated in 
Argentine pesos (up from just 3 percent in 2001).  It remains to be seen how the Argentine government with ultimately deal with the investors hol ding almost $20 billion 
in defaulted bonds who did not accept the government’s offer.

In Venezuela , on March 3 the government devalu ed the bolivar 10.7 percent.  
Venezuela's currency had been pegged to the do llar since early 2003 in an attempt to rein 
in inflation; however, inflation has remained very high, ending 2004 at nearly 20 percent.  
The devaluation had been expected since earl y December, when it was factored into the 
2005 budget that was approved by the Venezuelan  congress.  At that time, however, 
Finance Minister Tobias Nobr ega was removed after he announced that the devaluation 
would take place on January 1.  Venezuela has been maintaining capital controls, which 
have deterred speculativ e pressures on internat ional reserves.
