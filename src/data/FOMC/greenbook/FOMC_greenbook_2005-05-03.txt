Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Overview  
Economic activity appears to have softened of late after having posted sizable gains 
around the turn of the year.  Payroll employ ment increased only modestly in March, and 
manufacturing production has risen only a litt le, on balance, over the past couple of 
months.  On the expenditure side, consumer s seem to have turned cautious—perhaps 
partly because of higher energy prices—and housing starts slumped in March after a 
string of spectacular readings.  In addition, capital spending is entering the second quarter 
with less forward momentum than seemed likely a month ago.  Rising energy prices have pushed up headline inflation in recent months, and core inflation also moved up in the first quarter. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand has continued to increase, albeit  at a slow pace.  A rise of just 101,000 in 
private nonfarm payroll employment in Marc h left the three-mont h moving average at 
142,000, a level similar to the average monthl y gain in the second half of 2004.  The 
workweek, at 33.7 hours, was unchanged in March, but the increase in employment 
generated a small rise in aggr egate hours of production workers;  for the first quarter as a 
whole, these hours were 2 per cent (annual rate ) above their fourth- quarter level.   
 Slack in the labor market has continued to erode gradually.  In March, the unemployment 
rate moved back down to its January level of 5.2 percent.  Another measure of the 
prevalence of individuals searching for wo rk—the rate of insured unemployment—has 
also decreased this year and stands near it s level in early 1997.   Nevertheless, labor 
market conditions have still proven insufficien t to pull potential workers back into the 
labor force; the labor force participation rate  in March remained at its cyclical low of 
65.8 percent.  In addition, many job seekers have experienced long periods of search.  
Long-term unemployment is still high, a nd the exhaustion rate—the proportion of 
workers leaving the unemployment insurance (UI) rolls after having used their entire 
period of eligibility (usually twenty-s ix weeks)—remained elevated in March. 
 The four-week moving average of initial cl aims for UI was 323,000 in the week ending 
on April 23.  Although claims have risen from th e low levels observed in February, they 
are still below the range that prevailed in the fourth quarter of last  year.  Meanwhile, the 
JOLTS hiring rate moved down further in Fe bruary after a spike in late 2004, and the 
volatile series on hiring plans from the NFIB dropped sharply in March.  In contrast, the 
job openings rate from the JOLTS survey was unchanged in February at a level

somewhat above its late-2004 values, while th e help-wanted index fell back in March but 
reversed only a portion of its s purt earlier in the year.   
 Uptrends in the fraction of small firms w ith hard-to-fill positions and in households’ 
perceptions of job availabili ty are consistent with the gradual improvement in labor 
demand and with the slow erosion of slack implied by the decline in the unemployment 
rate.  However, in recent months, households seem to have become more pessimistic about future labor market conditions, and e xpected conditions in both the Michigan and 
Conference Board surveys are now at or below the low end of the range seen in the past 
two years. 
 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production continued to expand in early 2005, alth ough the pace of expansion 
has slowed in recent months.  Overall i ndustrial production increased 0.3 percent in 
March, but the rise largely reflected a surge in energy output.  Manufacturing output 
slipped 0.1 percent in March, and the data fo r both January and Fe bruary were revised 
down to show smaller increases  than previously reported.  For the first quarter as a 
whole, factory output rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent,  the slowest rate since the 
middle of 2003.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing edged down to 78.0 percent in 
March; that figure is 2.1 per centage points above its year -ago level but 1.8 percentage 
points below its 1972-2004 average.      Among the energy-producing industries, utilitie s output jumped 3.6 percent in March, as 
temperatures returned to seasonal norm s after two months of unseasonably warm 
weather.  Production also increased in Marc h for all major energy-mining categories.  
Available weekly data point to a decline in electricity generation in April; energy mining 
is up a touch.    Motor vehicle assemblies fell back in March to an annual rate of 12.0 million units after 
having moved up to a rate of 12.6 million units in February.  Assemblies are scheduled to 
fall another 600,000 units (annual rate) in Ap ril, and the lower production of motor 
vehicles and parts will likely shave nearly 0.2 percentage poin t from the change in April 
IP.  Elsewhere in transportation, production of  commercial aircraft jumped in March and

The output of high-tech industries rose a te pid 0.9 percent in Ma rch.  Still, production 
increased at an annual rate of 29 percent for the first quarter as a whole—the largest quarterly advance since the middle of 2000.  Mu ch of the first-quarter strength was in 
semiconductors, where gains were broadly ba sed across end-use categories.  However, 
Intel’s latest revenue forecast suggests that real semiconductor output will rise at a more 
moderate rate in the second quarter.  Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers appear cautious about the outlook for high-tech; orders for semiconductor-fabricating equipment continue to languish well below shipments.

decline several percentage points in 2005, though spendi ng in the United States is likely to increase.  In 
fact, Intel recently revised up the range of its planned capital spending in 2005 by $500 million, to between 
$5.4 billion and $5.8 billion; this projection is significantly higher than the $3.8 billion the company spent 
last year.

United States were soft in the first quarter,  although rest-of-world sales apparently were 
relatively strong.  Communications equipment output, despite falling in March, rose more 
than 24 percent at an annual rate for the quarter  as a whole.  Industry contacts, as well as 
company reports, suggest that major provide rs of telecommunications services are 
ramping up spending on communications equi pment, both to build wireless network 
infrastructure and to expand and upgrade br oadband-delivery cap abilities.  Looking 
ahead, the respondents to the recent NABE survey remain upbeat about spending plans 
for high-tech equipment.  CIO Magazine ’s diffusion index for future spending on 
computer hardware rose in March afte r having trended down for a few months. 
 Outside energy, transportation, and high-t ech products, production was mixed across 
market groups in the first quarter.  The output  of business equipment rose at an annual 
rate of more than 5 percent, in part because  of strong gains in mining, oil, and gas field 
machinery.  The production of defense and spa ce equipment surged nearly 10 percent.  
By contrast, the production of both durable a nd nondurable consumer goods was slow, as 
was the upstream output of both constr uction supplies and materials.   
 Outside the declines in motor vehicle assemblies and electricity generation, the other available weekly production data for April contri bute little to the change in IP.  The broad 
forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity have been mixed.  The diffusion 
index of new orders from the ISM in March wa s consistent with furt her moderate gains in 
IP, and the pop-up in new orders in April’s Philadelphia Fed survey was another positive sign.  However, the information from the Ne w York Fed's April su rvey and data through 
March for the staff’s measure of real adjusted  durable goods orders s uggest little , if any, 
increase in IP in the near term.  
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles have continued to run below the rapid pace of late 2004, although 
they have improved appreciably in the past  couple of months.  Indeed, after having 
dropped to an annual rate of 16¼ million units in January and February, sales increased 
to 16¾ million units in March, and confiden tial reports from our industry contacts 
suggest that they will rise furt her in April.  Incentives appear  to have contributed little to 
the pickup in sales.  Although some manuf acturers have announced programs to boost 
sales of last year’s models that are still in  stock, the average value of incentives through 
mid-April remained well below the levels of last fall.

II-13 
One puzzle is that the recent firming of sale s has occurred despite a dramatic worsening 
in consumers’ perceptions of buying conditions :  The Michigan SRC index of car-buying 
attitudes has fallen sharply in  the past few months, in part because of a drop in the 
fraction of respondents citing ei ther low prices or low inte rest rates as a reason for it 
being a good time to buy a vehicle.  The number of respondents who mentioned gas 
prices as the source of their pessimistic vi ew of buying conditions also jumped noticeably 
in April.3  
 Motor vehicle inventories shrank a bit in the first quarter.  However,  dealers’ stocks—
especially of light trucks—remain high by hist orical standards.  Th e automakers’ latest 
plans call for assemblies to drop from 12.2 milli on units (annual rate) in the first quarter 
to 11.8 million units in the second quarter.  Even if these plans are realized, however, 
inventories will likely remain high through th e summer, unless the pace of sales picks up. 
 
Consumer Spending  
Apart from a falloff in outlays on motor vehi cles, consumer spending appears to have 
posted a sizable gain in the first quarter.  Th at said, the first-quarter increase seems to 
have been largely the result of  a high level of spending early in the year.  In particular, 
retail sales in the categories that are include d in the BEA’s estimate of PCE control—that 
is, sales by establishments other than auto  dealers and building material and supply 
stores—were flat in March in nominal terms;  excluding gasoline stations, these sales fell 
0.6 percent.  The weakness was evident across a broad range of stores .  Factoring in our 
estimates of consumer prices, we estimate that real spending on PCE goods other than 
motor vehicles slumped 0.8 percent in Marc h after having risen 0.8 percent in January 
and 0.3 percent in February.
4 
 More recently, weekly data on chain store sale s suggest that retail spending has been 
decent so far in April, although consumer se ntiment declined further.  The Michigan 
SRC’s preliminary index of consumer sent iment and the Conference Board’s index of 
consumer confidence both fell in April for the third straight month.  The Michigan index 
is now below its average r eading in 2004, whereas the Conf erence Board index remains a 
bit above its average 2004 level. 
                                                
 
3 Although increases in prices for gasoline do not ap pear to have had an appreciable effect on total 
light-vehicle sales, we have recently seen a shift in demand away from large, light trucks (including vans, pickups, and sport-utility vehicles) and toward  smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
4 The BEA’s estimate of PCE in March and any revisions to the data for earlier months will be released 
on Friday and reported in  the Greenbook Supplement.

 Nevertheless, the fundamental factors underl ying consumer spending remain favorable, 
although somewhat less so than at the tim e of the last Greenbook.  Real wages and 
salaries appear to have risen at a solid rate last quarter.  The ratio of wealth to income 
was roughly unchanged last quarter and remained  high relative to its average level in 
recent years and to its long-run average.  Acco rding to the published data, the saving rate 
averaged ¾ percent in the firs t two months of the year, a fi gure consistent with the high 
wealth-to-income ratio and the low level of interest rates.

Housing  
The sharp drop in starts in March notwithst anding, housing activity retains considerable 
vigor.  Last month’s fall in single-family st arts—to an annual rate of 1.54 million units—
came on the heels of strong readings in Ja nuary and February, and the substantial 
increase in the permit backlog in March s uggests that starts will probably move up in 
April.6  The multifamily sector exhibited a similar pattern:  Starts fell in March, but the 
permit backlog rose, a sign that so me bounceback in April is likely. 
 Home sales stayed strong in March.  At an  annual rate of 6.04 m illion units, sales of 
single-family existing homes remained around th e ebullient levels prevailing since mid- 
                                                
 
 5 The Annual Benchmark Report for Retail Trade and Food Services, which was released on March 31, 
implies a downward revision to the level of consumer spending and an upward revision to the saving rate, all else being equal.  We estimate th at the upward revision to the first-qu arter saving rate from this source, 
in isolation, amounts to about ½ percentage point. 
6 The backlog increased both because the level of permits—adjusted for activity in areas where permits 
are not required—was slightly higher  than the level of starts and becau se of an apparent correction to a 
previous misclassification of permits.

2004.  In March, sales of new homes soared to  the highest level on record; for the first 
quarter as a whole, they averaged 1.30 million units at an annual rate, a pace more than 
8 percent above the total for 2004.  The performance of home prices in the firs t quarter was mixed.  The average price of 
existing homes was up 10 percent from a year  earlier, and the average price of new 
homes advanced 7¾ percent during the same period.  However, the constant-quality price index for new homes ―which controls for changes in  the geographic composition of 
sales, home size, and a few other readily measurable attributes ―was up only 4½ percent, 
compared with an average pace of about 7½ per cent in the second half of last year.  The 
repeat-transactions index for existing homes in the fourth quarter of last year (the most 
recent observation) was 11¼ percent higher than  it was a year earlier.        
 Recent indicators suggest that housing demand likely will hold at a reasonably high level 
in the near term.  In the last week of April,  the rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages 
was 5.78 percent, a figure about the same as that  at the end of last year and close to its 
average over the past two years.  The rate for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages has also 
changed little, on net, since the end of last ye ar.  After having dippe d in January, the four-
week moving average of mortgage applica tions to purchase homes has rebounded during 
the past couple of months, and the most recent  readings are only slightly lower than the 
record highs posted last fall.   
Equipment and Software  
Real investment in equipment and software ap pears to have posted a respectable gain in 
the first quarter, although spending seems to ha ve lost some steam since the turn of the 
year.  The weakness in shipments and orders  in March implies a less rosy near-term 
outlook than seemed likely a month ago, a lthough the fundamental s supporting capital 
spending remain favorable.  Indeed, business ou tput has been rising at a solid rate, and 
the user cost of capital has continued to declin e (albeit somewhat more slowly than it did 
several years ago).  In addition, even though real cash flow did not increase during 2004, 
it remains at a high level, and firms continue to hold an abundance of liquid assets.  The 
Beige Book and other survey evidence suggest  that businesses are fairly comfortable 
about the outlook.    In the high-tech sector, shipments of co mputers and communications equipment were 
down, on balance, in nominal terms in February  and March.  Nonetheles s, a big rise in

shipments in January and continued falling pr ices in this categor y support a substantial 
increase in real outlays for these type s of equipment in the first quarter.   
 After having surged in the s econd half of last year, busine ss purchases of motor vehicles 
appear to have moderated in early 2005.  As noted, sales of li ght vehicles dropped 
sharply in the first quarter, a nd some of the decline likely wi ll show up as lower business 
spending.  However, sales of medium and hea vy trucks rose further, on average, through 
March, and net new orders—though down from th eir highs in the fourth quarter—suggest 
that sales will remain robust in the months ah ead.  Order backlogs fo r these vehicles are 
still high as well.   Real business spending on non-high-tech, non- transportation equipment seems to have 
softened lately after an ex ceptionally strong performance ar ound the turn of the year.   
Shipments fell 1½ percent in March after ha ving dropped 3 percent in February.  The 
deceleration has been concentrated in constr uction, farm, and industr ial machinery, all of 
which had posted sizable increases in the sec ond half of 2004.  Orders for this broad 
category have also slackened over the past couple of mont hs but still are running above 
shipments.   
 
Nonresidential Construction 
Real construction of nonresidential structures  remains depressed.  Outlays in the power 
and communications sector and on manufacturing facilities have  picked up a bit recently.  
However, spending on commerci al structures has moved lower after an uptick in mid-
2004, and outlays for office buildings are still moribund despite some easing in the vacancy rate for that sector.  The number of  rigs drilling for natu ral gas continues on a 
steep upward trend even as pe troleum drilling remains soft. 
 
Business Inventories  
The book value of business inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of 
$108 billion, on average, in January and Februa ry, a rate similar to that in the fourth 
quarter.  Interpreting the book-valu e data is especially difficult  in periods when prices are 
rising rapidly, but we suspect th at real inventories have con tinued to expand briskly this 
year.  The book-value invent ory-sales ratios have gene rally edged up, and although the 
majority of purchasing managers in the ISM survey continue to think that customer 
inventories are too low, the number with that  view has decreased of late.  Information 
from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system indicates that inventor ies are mostly in

Federal Government Sector  
The incoming data do not point to any major change in the federa l budget situation.  
According to the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS ), both receipts and outlays have 
posted hefty increases in recent months, and th e deficit in the unified budget in March, at 
$71 billion, was about the same as it was a year earlier. 
 Outlays in March, adjusted for financial transactions and payment-timing shifts, were about 7 percent above their ye ar-earlier level.  Defense spending was 9 percent higher 
than it was last March, in line with the incr eases posted over the past year.  Outlays in 
other categories also rose roughl y in line with recent trends. 
 Adjusted receipts in March were about 12 pe rcent higher than they  were last year.  
Corporate income tax receipts, which incl uded final payments on 2004 tax liabilities, 
were up an impressive 43 percent.  Data fo r April—when the first quarterly payment on 
2005 liabilities is due for most firms—point  to another strong month for corporate 
collections.  According to the MTS , withheld individual income taxes and social insurance taxes rose 
moderately in March.  Information from the Daily Treasury Statements  through late April 
suggests that nonwithheld indivi dual and payroll taxes, whic h are largely final payments 
on 2004 individual income tax liabi lities, are up more than 25 percent this tax season over 
last.  This large increase reflects the fact that  final payments last year were held down by 
the effects of the 2003 tax bill.
7  Refunds (including the refu ndable portions of the EITC 
and the child credit, which are counted as out lays) are running only slightly higher than 
they did during last year’s filing season. 
 On the legislative front, the Senate and the House have passed budget resolutions for 
fiscal year 2006.  The plans from both cham bers call for a small increase in real 
appropriations for defense and little change  in funding for nondefense programs, in line 
with the President’s proposals.  The two budget resolutions contain different  
                                                
 
7 The 2003 tax bill was passed in the summer of 2003 but was made retroactive to January 1, 2003.  
Thus, some of the reductions in 2003 tax liability showed  up as lower final payments and higher refunds in 
the spring of 2004.

guidelines for mandatory spending and receip ts, but press reports suggest that the 
differences have been resolved.  
State and Local Governments   
State and local government spending remain s on a gradual uptrend.  Employment rose 
10,000 in March, with small advances in  both the education and non-education 
categories.  In addition, sizab le gains in spending on highways and bridges kept nominal 
construction expenditures moving up through February (the most recent data).  
 According to a mid-April report from the Na tional Conference of St ate Legislatures, the 
sector’s fiscal situation c ontinues to improve, although conditions remain uneven across 
the states.  Revenue flows appear to have qui ckened, and all but a few states reported that 
collections from major taxes in 2005 are comi ng in at or above projected levels.  About 
half of the states, however , are facing prospective budget gaps for fiscal 2006 as 
Medicaid costs continue to so ar and pressures to reverse ea rlier cuts to K-12 education 
remain intense. 
 
Prices   
Spurred by sharp increases in energy prices , consumer price infl ation turned up in 
February and March.  Consumer prices excludi ng food and energy have also been rising a 
bit more rapidly of late, with core PCE pr ices estimated to have increased 2½ percent 
(annual rate) in the past three months.
8  During the twelve months ending in March, core 
PCE prices rose an estimated 1.6 percent, a bout the same pace as in the preceding twelve-
month period.  Consumer energy prices posted large run-ups in February and March, as the jump in 
crude oil prices since the turn  of the year showed through to the retail level.  Retail 
gasoline prices climbed almost 8 percent in  March.  And although gasoline inventories 
are at the upper end of their historical range for this time of year and crude prices have 
eased slightly, survey data suggest that retail  gasoline margins have shot up in the past 
few weeks, thereby pushing consumer gasoline prices up further in April.  Higher prices 
of crude oil in recent months have also boos ted the cost of heavy fuel and induced some 
substitution toward natural gas by industrial users; this substituti on has lately pushed up 
the price of natural gas as well.

Prices for consumer foods rose 0.2 percent in March, as price increases for food away 
from home—which accounts for more than 40 percent of consumer  food expenditures—
moderated after having jumped in January and Fe bruary.  Overall, the rise in the CPI for 
food so far this year has decelerated to a modest annual rate of 1¼ percent after having 
risen at a 3½ percent rate over the final three months of 2004.   
 A rise of 0.4 percent in the core CPI in Ma rch boosted the three-month change to an 
annual rate of 3¼ percent.  Core goods prices  as measured in the CPI were flat for a 
second month in March, as a jump in apparel pr ices was offset by declines in prices of 
durable goods, especially motor vehicles.  Ho wever, prices of core consumer services 
rose 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percen t increase in February.  The large increase in services 
prices in March reflects a sharp jump in th e price of lodging away from home, which is 
sometimes erratic from month to month; sizab le increases were also recorded in the 
categories of air fares, me dical services , and tuition.  
 We estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.2 pe rcent in March—a rate considerably less 
than the core CPI.  One important reason fo r the difference is that  lodging away from 
home has a much lower weight in PCE prices  than it does in the CPI.  Taking a longer 
perspective, the estimated increase of 1.6 percen t in core PCE prices ov er the past year is 
only a touch above the year-over-year readings that have prevailed since last summer.  
Core goods prices, despite having remained fl at in February and March, have accelerated 
noticeably over the past year; the pickup a pparently reflects higher import prices, the 
indirect effect of higher energy prices, and higher prices for co re intermediate materials.  
The opposite picture is evident in the incomi ng data for core PCE services—the twelve-
month change has moved lower over the past ye ar despite the more-ra pid increases of the

 In the preliminary Michigan survey for April, households’ median expectation for 
inflation over the next year edged up one-t enth, to 3.3 percent, after a 0.3 percentage 
point jump in March.  This shift in near-term inflation expectations is consistent with the 
energy-induced pickup in headline inflation.  The preliminary April reading on longer- 
                                                
 
9 The twelve-month change in the PCE for core services has moved down during the past year, 
whereas its counterpart in the CPI has remained abou t flat.  This relative decline in the PCE measure 
reflects a reported deceleration in non -market services prices, a smaller we ight on housing services (whose 
prices have risen relatively rapidly of late), and the use of PPIs (which have been rising more slowly than 
the corresponding CPIs) to measure th e cost of many medical services.

term inflation expectations remained at the upp er end of the narrow range seen in the past 
few years.  A rise of 0.3 percent in the PPI for capital equipment in March more than reversed a 
0.2 percent decline in Fe bruary; last month, pric es for autos and light trucks slipped a bit 
further after February’s large decline, whereas prices for heavy trucks rose 0.4 percent 
and prices for other capital equipment rose 0.5 percent.  During the twelve months ending 
in March, the PPI for capital equipment increas ed 2¾ percent, a pickup of more than  
2 percentage points from the preceding year.    At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials rose a modest 
0.3 percent in March after larg er increases in January a nd February.  Between March 
2004 and March 2005, this index rose 7½ per cent, compared with an increase of 
3 percent over the preceding year.  Highe r inflation rates for energy and imported 
materials, as well as rising rates of capacity utilization, explain much of this acceleration.  
 Prices for industrial metals, though a bit off th eir recent peaks, have remained quite high 
so far this year.  The metals index in the Journal of Commerce  is down 1.8 percent since 
the March Greenbook.  Among the other commod ity indexes that exclude energy, the 
CRB spot industrials index ha s increased 0.9 percent since the last Greenbook, and the 
CRB spot foodstuffs index has fallen 1.3 percent.  The JOC industrial index and the CRB 
futures index, both of which contain a substa ntial energy component, have declined since 
the last Greenbook, although the futures index is up considerably since the beginning of 
this year.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
During the intermeeting period, policy expecta tions were shaped more by the weaker-
than-expected data on spending and production than by the upside surprises on prices.  
On net, market participants marked down the anticipated path for the federal funds rate, 
and nominal Treasury yields moved lower acro ss the curve.  Despite generally positive 
first-quarter earnings reports, eq uity prices declined  in response to indicators of economic 
weakness.  Credit spreads on corporate bonds widened, particularly for speculative-grade 
firms.  Business issuance of long-term debt has been subdued in recent months, but short-
term borrowing has continued to expand bris kly.  Household debt growth, though still 
strong, appears to be running at a rate a bit below that of the rapid pace of last year.    
        
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The FOMC’s decision to raise the target fede ral funds rate 25 basi s points at the March 
meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets.  However, the references in the 
statement to increasing inflation pressures a nd to more-evident pr icing power reportedly 
led market participants to ma rk up their expected path for the federal funds rate, as did 
the surprising jump in the CPI reported the next  day.  Despite another outsized increase in 
the CPI a month later, these changes to policy expectations  were more than reversed 
subsequently in response to the weaker-than- expected economic data  and the release of 
the minutes of the March FOMC meeting, wh ich suggested that the Committee saw less 
upside risk to inflation than investors ha d previously anticipa ted.  Although market 
participants seem virtually certa in of a quarter-point increase in the target funds rate at 
the upcoming meeting, the perceived chance of a pause at the June meeting has risen and 
now stands at about one in four.  Looking further ahead, in vestors have ratcheted down 
the expected level of the funds rate  nearly ¼ percentage point in 2006. 
 Nominal Treasury yields largely followed ch anges in policy expect ations:  Since the 
March FOMC meeting, the two-year yield m oved down about 10 basis points, while the 
five- and ten-year yields fell 25 and 30 basis points respectiv ely.  With inflation-indexed 
yields down by less, inflation compensation ov er the next five years declined 15 basis 
points, and inflation compensation over the su bsequent five years fell almost 20 basis 
points.   
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads  
Broad equity price indexes sank about 3½ per cent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
as weaker-than-expected economic data and a few high-profil e disappointments in 
earnings spooked investors.  Th e fall in stock prices was wide spread, with retail and basic

materials stocks posting particul arly large declines.  The ga p between the trend-adjusted 
forward earnings-price ratio and the real perp etuity Treasury yield widened a bit and now 
stands somewhat above its average level over the past two decades.  Implied volatilities 
on the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 moved up a bit from very low levels, likely a reflection of the greater uncerta inty about the economic outlook. 
 Troubles in the auto sector evid ently led investors to be more  wary about risk.  Yields on 
investment-grade corporate bonds declined less than those on comparable-maturity 
Treasuries, causing spreads on BBB-rated bonds to widen about 20 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on speculative-gra de bonds rose about 50 basis points, which 
pushed spreads up more than 60 basis points si nce the last FOMC meeting.  The sharp 
widening of credit spreads brought the staff’s estimate of the risk premium on high-yield 
bonds—which had recently narrowed to levels  last seen in 1997—back to more-typical 
territory.  In the commercial paper market, the quality spread, though narrow on average, 
has been somewhat volatile, in part because of the current thinness of the A2/P2 segment 
of the market.   
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
On the basis of reports from about 300 S&P 500 firms to date, earnings per share in the 
first quarter most likely rose more than 13 per cent from the year-earlier levels, or about 3 
percent from the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Although the majority of 
announcements beat analysts’ forecasts, retail  firms—which almost certainly experienced 
a disappointing first quarter in light of sagging sales—have ye t to report their earnings.  
The index of analysts’ revisions  to year-ahead earnings for ecasts was slightly above zero 
in mid-April because sharply lower year-ahead forecasts for Ford, GM, and IBM largely offset the still-rising fore cast for the energy sector. 
 Nonfinancial firms remain flush with cash, and credit quality in the se ctor continues to be 
strong on balance.  Solid credit quality of commercial loan portfo lios was reflected in 
reduced loan-loss provisions at a number of  large bank holding companies in the first 
quarter.  The pace of bond downgrades slowed c onsiderably in the first quarter, although 
the downgrade of GM in early April will result in a significant deterioration in this measure of corporate credit quality for the second quarter.  The six-month trailing default rate on bonds was little changed in March at a low level.  The aggregate expected year-
ahead default rate, which is based on KMV’ s firm-level estimates, remained low in 
March but is likely to edge up in April, given the decline in stock pr ices and the rise in 
equity volatility.

Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial  corporations remained s ubdued in March and April.  
Speculative-grade issuance has been anemic in  recent weeks as credit spreads in that 
segment of the market widened appreciably.  Net of retirements, bond issuance has been 
negligible recently, in part be cause issuers have continued to  use proceeds to refinance 
existing debt rather than to fund expansion.  By contrast, business loans and commercial 
paper continued to expand notably ov er the intermeeting period.     
 Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms dwindled to a trickle over the intermeeting period.  
However, filings with the SEC of impending IPOs remained plentiful, and issuance is 
expected to pick up after the first-quarter earnings reporting season.  Share repurchases in 
the first quarter are estimated to have riva led their torrid fourth-quarter pace, and 
although completions of cash-financed mergers retreated somewhat in the first quarter, 
new announcements pointed to robu st M&A activity going forward. 
 
Commercial Real Estate  
Supported in part by low interest rates, the expansion of commercial mortgage debt likely 
continued apace, as evidenced by heavy CMBS issuance in the first quarter and a full 
calendar of offerings going forward.  Investme nt-grade CMBS spreads widened slightly 
over the intermeeting period—about in line with the widening of spreads for investment-
grade corporate bonds—even as delinquency rates on loans backing CMBS declined 
further in March.  The ratio of net oper ating income to prices for commercial 
properties—an indicator of the rate of return in this sect or—slipped further in the first 
quarter.  However, the difference between this  ratio and the real Treasury perpetuity 
yield, a rough gauge of the risk premium on commercial real estate assets, was little 
changed in the first quarter, remaining in th e lower part of the range observed over the 
past decade.         
Household Finance  
The staff estimates that the growth of house hold mortgage debt moderated a bit in the 
first quarter.  In the absence of much actua l data on mortgage flows, this assessment 
reflects the less robust pace of house price appreciation recorded  in the fourth quarter and 
is consistent with the weakening of demand for residential mortgage loans over the past 
three months reported in the April Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey.  After topping  
6 percent in the second half of  March, interest rates on thir ty-year fixed-rate mortgages 
dropped about ¼ percentage point, which spurred a slight lift in refina ncing activity in the

first part of April.  Consumer credit con tinues to run moderately  above its year-earlier 
levels.  On April 20, the President signed into law bankruptcy reform legislation designed to 
reduce incentives for individuals to file fo r bankruptcy.  News of the legislation’s 
impending passage appeared to have sparked a surge of personal bankruptcy filings in March, which have continued apace in April.  Despite this surge, other measures of 
household credit quality, includ ing a variety of delinquency rates, have continued to 
improve modestly.  With broad stock price indexes down so far th is year, the ratio of household net worth to 
disposable personal income has likely edged lo wer.  Flows to domestic equity mutual 
funds softened in March and early April in  line with declines in equity prices. 
   
Treasury and Agency Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, th e Treasury auctioned five- and ten-year TIPS as well as 
two- and five-year nominal coupon securities.  The TIPS auctions were well received, but 
the demand for nominal securities was only lukewarm:  The bid-to-cover ratios and 
indirect bids—a proxy for demand for Treasurie s from foreign official institutions—were 
below recent averages, consistent with the ebbing of this demand suggested by the Treasury’s data on international capital flow s.  The same data, however, suggest that 
private foreign demand for Treasuries has stre ngthened appreciably in  recent months.  
Late in the period, investors took note of remarks by Treasury Secretary Snow that 
seemed to hint that the Treasury may be c onsidering reintroducing sales of thirty-year 
bonds.  Fannie Mae’s stock price ended the period down only slightly, on net, despite reports of 
further violations of accounting rules and Ch airman Greenspan’s and Secretary Snow’s 
remarks supporting limits on the size of the i nvestment portfolios of the housing GSEs.  
Freddie Mac’s share price, by contrast, decl ined more after the company’s delayed 2004 
earnings report showed a drop in net income of  41 percent.  Spreads of yields on GSEs’ 
senior unsecured debt relativ e to those on comparable-matur ity Treasuries have widened 
10 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.

State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds continued at a rapid pace in March and 
April.  Investments in transportation- and education-related projects fueled new capital 
issuance, and still-low interest  rates supported a spate of a dvance refunding issues.  In 
contrast, short-term issuance remained weak in the first quarter, likely a reflection of 
improving budget situations in many states.  The downgrade of a portion of Michigan’s debt —related to the difficulties of Ford and 
GM—cut into the ongoing improvement in ove rall municipal credit qua lity over the past 
several quarters.  This downgrade, which affected a multitude of small bonds issued by nearly every school district in  the state, accounts for almost all of the downgrades so far 
in 2005 but amounts to only about $2 billion of outstanding debt.  Long-term municipal 
bond yields edged down in recent weeks, and the ratio of these yields to comparable-
maturity Treasury yields was about unch anged over the interm eeting period.    
 
Money and Bank Credit 
The growth of M2 is estimated to have slow ed further in April from an already subdued 
first-quarter pace.  A contrac tion in liquid deposits—likely a consequence of their higher 
opportunity cost—accounted for the bulk of  deceleration.  In contrast, small time 
deposits, whose yields have kept pace with risi ng market interest rate s, continued to grow 
briskly.  The prolonged runoff of retail mone y market mutual funds appears to have 
slowed recently, as higher market intere st rates have shown through to money fund 
yields, boosting the relative attrac tiveness of this M2 component. 
 Bank credit growth slowed sharply in April, as banks’ holdings of securities contracted 
after outsized increases in the first quarter.  Loan growth also slowed but is estimated to 
have remained brisk, and C&I and real estate lo ans continued to regist er large gains.  The 
robust expansion in commercial lending is consistent with the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, which indicated a no ticeable increase in the demand for C&I and 
commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  A significant proportion of 
survey respondents also reported that, over th e same period, they have eased their lending 
standards and terms on these types of loans.

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The April 2005 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey contained special questions on the net changes in C&I lending standards and terms since 1996-97 and on the reasons for 
those changes.  This appendix reports the responses from fifty-four domestic banks and 
nineteen foreign banking institutions.  As has been the case since the beginning of 2004, notable fractions of banking institutions reported in the latest survey th at they had eased lending standards and terms 
for C&I loans over the past three months.  Banks that eased standards or terms once 
again reported having done so in large part because of increased competition from other sources of business credit.  A moderate net fraction of banks also reported having eased 
lending standards for commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  Standards on residential mortgages were a bout unchanged over the past three months, 
and a small net fraction of banks had eased standards for consumer loans.  On the 
demand side, domestic and, to a lesser degr ee, foreign banks reported an increase in 
demand for C&I loans and for commercial real  estate loans. Also, a noticeably smaller 
net fraction of domestic banks reported weak er demand for residential mortgages and 
consumer loans than had done so in the January survey.  In response to special questions on longer-t erm changes in lending standards and terms 
on C&I loans, domestic and foreign banks re ported that, on net, lending standards for 
C&I loans were somewhat tighter relative to 1996-97.  Both groups reported, however, 
that many terms for C&I loans are somewhat  easier, on net, than they had been in 1996 
and 1997, a period thought to have been characterized by relatively accommodative lending practices.  Banks whose lending standa rds or terms currently are tighter cited 
improved risk-management techniques as the primary influence on the evolution of their credit policies, whereas banks whose lending standards or terms currently are 
easier noted a significant increase in competition from other lenders as the primary reason.  
C&I Lending  
In the April survey, domestic banks as well as branches and agencies of foreign banks 
reported a further net easing of standards and terms on C&I loans.  On net, nearly one-
fourth of domestic banks reported easing thei r standards for large and middle-market 
firms over the past three months, about the same net percentage that has prevailed in 
recent surveys. About 70 percent of domestic and of foreign banks narrowed spreads of 
loan rates over their cost of funds for these borrowers in the three months ending with 
 III-A-2   
 
 
April, up substantially from 45 percent in the January survey and the largest shares 
reported since these questions were added to the survey in 1990.  A large share of the 
foreign branches and agencies, on net, also reported reduced premiums on riskier loans 
and lower fees on credit lines.  Many domestic respondents indicated that they had eased other terms for large and middle-market firms as well:  Of the respondents, 40 percent had reduced the costs of credit lin es, and about one-fourth had eased covenant 
restrictions, increased the maximum size of loans, or did both.  For small firms, nearly one-fourth of domestic banks had eased lending standards—up from 13 percent in 
January—and more than half had trimmed spreads, on net.  All the domestic institutions that had eased their lending standards and terms over the 
past three months cited more-aggressive  competition from other banks or nonbank 
lenders as a somewhat important or—much more commonly—a very important reason for doing so.  In addition, about half of those respondents cited a more-favorable or 
less-uncertain economic outlook as a reason for their move toward a less-stringent lending posture, although that figure was down from 60 percent in January.  A notable 
share of domestic respondents that had eased standards or terms also indicated that the change reflected a higher tolerance for risk and greater liquidity in the secondary market.  Branches and agencies of foreign banks that had eased lending terms also universally emphasized the importance of increased competition from other lenders, and half of the foreign respondents, on net, noted increased liquidity in secondary loan 
markets.  On net, 37 percent of domestic instituti ons—down from 45 percent in the January 
survey—reported an increase in demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market 
firms.  The same net fraction of domestic respondents also indicated that demand from small firms had increased—up a bit from the previous survey.  The domestic respondents experiencing stronger loan de mand most frequently pointed to their 
borrowers’ increased financing needs for inv estment in plant and equipment, accounts 
receivable, and inventory financing as sources of increased demand.  The survey results for foreign banks suggest that demand was somewhat stronger, on net, and the banks 
that reported an increase credited mainly merger and acquisition financing for the change.  About 40 percent of the domestic respondents, on net—down from nearly 50 percent in the 
January survey—reported that inquiries from potential business borrowers had increased over the past three months.  At foreign banks, about one-fifth of branches and agencies, on net—up from 10 percent in the previous survey—reported an increase in 
inquiries from potential business borrowers over the past three months.  
 III-A-3   
 
 
Longer-term changes in C&I lending conditions .  Notable fractions of respondents to 
this survey have been reporting an easing of standards or terms, on net, since the 
beginning of 2004, and other sources suggest that  C&I loan spreads have reached levels 
near those prevailing before lending terms began to tighten in 1998.  Against this 
background, respondent banks were asked to compare their current standards and terms 
on C&I loans with those that they offered on similar loans in 1996-97.    The results for lending standards point to a somewhat more-stringent lending posture.  
A small net fraction of domestic banks reporte d that their standards for loans to large 
and mid-sized firms were tighter than they had been in 1996 and 1997.  The fraction of domestic banks that viewed their current lending standards for loans to small firms as tighter than they had been in 1996 and 1997 was nearly equal to the fraction that indicated their standards were currently easier than they had been.  Notably, the largest 
banks in the sample reported tighter lending standards, on net, whereas smaller banks 
indicated that their standards were easier now than they were in 1996 and 1997.  At foreign banks, nearly half the branches and agencies characterized their lending 
standards as tighter than they were in 1996 and 1997, whereas only 16 percent characterized them as easier.     Both foreign and domestic banks reported that , on balance, pricing terms were currently 
easier than they were in 1996-97, but the net fractions reporting changes in nonprice terms were small.  Half of domestic banks, on net, reported that loan spreads for large 
and middle-market firms were narrower than they were in the earlier period, and about 
one-third, on net, noted that fees on credit lines were lower.  Smaller net percentages of 
foreign branches and agencies reported that pric ing terms were easier than they were in 
1996-97. Domestic banks suggested, on net,  that loan covenants and collateral 
requirements were little changed relative to conditions in 1996-97.  The net percentage 
of foreign banks that reported changes in loan covenants and collateral requirements 
was also small, although a few of those ins titutions indicated that they had eased these 
terms considerably over the period.  Not surprisingly, given the results of the mo st recent surveys, almost all the domestic 
banks and all the foreign banks that said that  their C&I loan standards and terms were 
easier now than earlier reported that comp etition from other banks  and nonbank lenders 
was a very important reason for the change.  A large majority also noted that improved measurement and management of risk had in creased their tolerance for risk.  At the 
same time, however, a substantial fraction of the domestic and foreign banks that 
reported tighter current lending standards or terms indicated that improved measurement and management of risk had reduced their tolerance for risk.  Almost half the domestic banks and two-thirds of the foreign banks that reported having tighter 
 III-A-4   
 
 
lending conditions now than in the earlier pe riod also noted increased concerns about 
corporate governance and financial reporting. 
Commercial Real Estate Lending   
Almost one-fourth of the domestic responde nts, on net, had eased lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the past three months, about the same fraction as in 
the January survey.   All but one of the tw elve foreign branches and agencies active in 
commercial real estate lending reported unchanged standards.  On net, 20 percent of the 
domestic respondents reported stronger demand for these loans in the April survey, nearly the same fraction as in the January surv ey.  One-third of the foreign banks noted 
that demand had increased somewhat over the past three months, up from 15 percent in January.  
Lending to Households 
Credit standards on residential mortgages were  largely unchanged, on net, in the April 
survey, in contrast to a small net easing of standards in January.  Though demand for residential mortgage loans reportedly weaken ed again over the past three months, the 
net fraction of banks reporting lower demand fell to 18 percent, compared with about 
25 percent in the past two surveys.    As has been the case since the middle of 2003, about 15 percent of the domestic respondents reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.  About 10 percent of banks, on net, indicated that they had eased standards on credit cards and non-credit-card consumer loans.  Terms on consumer loans changed at only a 
few banks, and the movements were mixed.  On net, banks indicated that demand for 
consumer loans weakened over the past thr ee months, but the fraction doing so declined 
to 20 percent from 26 percent in January and nearly 30 percent last October.

In February, as in January, the value of e xports of goods and services was flat.  Strong 
increases in exports of both industrial s upplies and consumer goods in February were 
offset by decreases in exports of automotive products and capital goods , with particularly 
sharp declines in exports of computers and telecommuni cations products.  Services 
exports were little changed from January.  Although exports of goods and services did 
not increase in January or February, they  maintained December’s strong level.  
Consequently, nominal exports in January and February combined were 7.6 percent (a.r.) 
above the fourth-quarter average.  The value of imported goods and services in creased 1.6 percent in February following 
1.8 percent growth in January.  The value of imported oil ju mped sharply, and imports of 
non-oil goods and services al so increased.  Among non-oil goods, imports of industrial 
supplies, consumer goods, and automotive prod ucts exhibited sizable gains, more than 
offsetting a large decrease in imports of capital goods.  Among consumer goods, imports 
of pharmaceuticals and cotton apparel were pa rticularly strong.  Within capital goods, 
imports of aircraft, semiconductors, and othe r capital goods fell sharply.  In January and 
February combined, imports of goods and servic es were more than 12 percent (a.r) above 
their fourth-quarter level.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In March, the prices of U.S. im ports of non-oil goods and of core 
goods rose 0.3 and 0.4 percent, respectively.  Th e material-intensive categories of foods, 
feeds, and beverages and non-o il industrial supplies were th e main contributors to the 
price increase.  Prices for non-oil industrial supplies rose 1.1 percent in March, mainly on 
higher prices for building materials, natura l gas, and chemicals.  Food prices rose 
3.4 percent, reflecting higher vegetable prices.  The cat egories of finished goods 
experienced either unchanged prices or pric e declines in March.  Prices for imported 
consumer goods fell 0.4 percent.  Within c onsumer goods, apparel prices fell 0.2 percent.  
For both capital goods (excl uding computers and semiconductors) and automotive 
products, prices were unchanged.  Prices fo r computers fell 0.7 percent in March, and 
those for semiconductors edged up. 
 The average level of imported core goods prices  in the first quarter was 5 percent at an 
annual rate above the fourth-quarter level.  A ll of the major categorie s, except automotive 
products, registered substantial price gains.  Du e to price increases in  the first two months 
of the quarter, the inflation rates for both capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and consumer goods moved noticeably higher. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil rose 10.6 pe rcent in March.  The spot price of West 
Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 13 pe rcent in March—averaging more than $54 per 
barrel.  The spot price rose to a new high of more than $57 per barrel on April 1, but has 
retraced those gains in response to a rise in  U.S. crude oil inventories, closing at 
$54.21 per barrel on April 26.  Oil prices remain  elevated due to continued strong oil 
demand and concerns about future supplies, pa rticularly from Iran, Ir aq, Nigeria, Russia, 
and Venezuela. 
 
Exports.  In March, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods rose 
0.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively.  As with imports, prices for material-intensive goods 
were the main contributors.  February’s 1 percent price decline fo r agricultural products 
was more than reversed by a 3.7 percent gain  in March, led by higher soybean prices.  
Prices for industrial supplies rose 1.2 percent,  as prices of fuels rose sharply.  Within 
finished goods, exported capital goods (exc luding computers and semiconductors) had 
IV-6 
the largest price increase in March at 0.2 percent.  Prices  for automotive products edged 
up, whereas prices for cons umer goods were unchanged.  Prices of both exported 
computers and semiconductors declined. 
 
The average level of exported core goods prices  in the first quarter was 6½ percent at an 
annual rate above the fourth-quarter level.   All categories had price increases, with 
industrial supplies having the largest gain. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) continue d strong in February, at a r ecord $67 billion.  There were 
substantial purchases of corporate bonds ( line 4c) and Treasury securities (line 4a), 
especially Treasury bonds.  Purchases of cor porate stocks (line 4d) also continued above 
their recent trend, but purchases of agency bonds (line 4b) moderated from high levels.  
Private inflows into U.S. securities in January and February combined are running 
roughly 50 percent above the rate recorded in 2004.    Net foreign official inflows (line 1) reversed to a slight outflow in February for the first 
time since April 2003.  Most of the $17 billi on swing from January to February was 
accounted for by notably smaller inflows fr om China and by outflows from Norway, 
where monthly data have been volatile.  Chin a's small net inflow reflected a significant 
decline in holdings of short-term securities th at was offset by an even larger increase in 
holdings of long-term securities.  The incr ease in holdings of long-term securities was 
only partially captured by the TIC system, with  the rest inferred from an increase in 
custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY).  (In general, the 
TIC system can only capture a subset of forei gn official transactions in U.S. assets, in 
large part because these transactions may involve intermediaries outside the United 
States.  Even when the TIC data are supplemented by confidential information on custody holdings at FRBNY, our measurement of thes e flows may be incomplete.)  Data from 
FRBNY indicate relatively small net inflows fr om China in March and the first half of  
April, and custody holdings for all countries indicate moderate net inflows for March and 
small net outflows thus far in April.   U.S. investors made large net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) in February.  
Consistent with recent monthl y data indicating substantial fl ows into world equity mutual 
funds, U.S. investors made large purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b).  The majority of 
IV-7 
these transactions were recorded with  the United Kingdom, and 20 percent were 
concentrated in Japan.   For the second month in row, U.S. investors sold a small amount 
of foreign bonds (line 5a).    The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a slight net in flow in February, reversing 
only a small part of the subs tantial outflow in January.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
On a trade-weighted basis, the exchange value of the dollar against major foreign 
currencies rose 2¼ percent on net this interm eeting period.  This increase largely reflects 
broad-based dollar appreciation in the week  following the March FOMC announcement.  
During April, the major currencies index was somewhat volatile but changed little on net 
as the dollar’s bilateral move ments against currencies in th e index were approximately 
offsetting; the dollar rose strongly agai nst the Canadian doll ar during April but 
depreciated against all other currencies in the index.  The nominal broad index of the 
dollar’s value rose 1 perc ent on balance over the intermeeting period.     
                  Early in the period, the dollar was supported by expectations that the FOMC might be 
more aggressive in raising rate s in an effort to counter infl ationary pressures, as well as 
by higher-than-expected U.S. price data whic h helped reinforce these views.  During 
April, however, data on economic activity in the United States as well as in the euro area, 
Canada, and Japan generally came in below expectations, and inte rest rates declined 
globally.  On balance, the dollar declined mode stly in April against all currencies in the 
major currencies index except the Canadian  dollar, as U.S. benchmark bond yields 
declined more than their foreign counterparts.

The dollar gained over 4 percent against th e Canadian dollar during the intermeeting 
period.  The decline in the Ca nadian dollar came amid a signi ficant downward shift in the 
expected path of short-term Canadian intere st rates.  Implied rates on Canadian dollar 
interest rate futures maturing later this year fell 30 to 40 basis points, exceeding the yield 
declines on comparable dollar, euro, and sterling instruments.  Following Canadian 
employment and GDP data that were somewhat  below expectations early in the period, 
the Bank of Canada revised down its for ecast for 2005 economic growth, suggesting to 
some investors that the Bank of Canada could put off further rate increases.  As had been 
widely expected, the Bank of Canada left it s policy rate unchanged at 2.5 percent at its 
meeting on April 12.  The Canadian dollar may also have been weighed down by political uncertainty associated with the possibility of  early national elections due to a financial 
scandal involving the ruling Liberal Party.  Statements by Bank of Canada Governor 
Dodge during the period referred to this polit ical uncertainty as a possible contributing 
factor to currency volatility.                                 Yields on benchmark bonds declined 17 basis poi nts in Japan and 25 to 29 basis points in

than had been expected, as well as disappointi ng U.S. data releases.  On the morning of 
April 28, the 10-year German government bond yield reached a new historic low of 3.40 
percent.  Inflation data from the euro area was,  in contrast, generall y a bit higher than had 
been expected, but elicited little change in  inflation compensation spreads for these 
countries.   Foreign three-month spot interest rates were little changed or dec lined slightly on net, 
reflecting relatively stable ne ar-term policy expectations.  As  had been widely expected, 
the European Central Bank and the Bank of England decided to leave their respective 
policy rates unchanged in meetings this period.  Euro yields declin ed slightly, however, 
after ECB President Trichet noted in a press conference following the ECB rate 
announcement that recent data from the euro area had been “mixed.”    Equity prices in Europe and Japan were ge nerally little changed to modestly higher 
through the first weeks of the pe riod, but declined sharply in the second half of April.  
Global share prices dropped in response to th e U.S. March retail sales data and then fell 
further following mixed earnings reports from th e technology sector.  Automobile sector 
shares underperformed on concerns over acc ounting issues and union negotiations at GM.  
The decline in broad European indexes was some what larger than that of U.S. markets.  
Japanese shares underperformed substant ially, reportedly weighed down by political 
tensions with China as well as weak domestic data.    The dollar’s value against our other important tr ading partners declined slightly on net, as 
a more than 7 percent depreciation in the dollar against the Brazilian real was nearly 
offset by modest gains against the currencie s of several emerging market economies in 
Asia.  The real rose against the dollar despite ev idence of a slowdown in domestic 
growth and a 9 percent decline in Brazil’s broad equity i ndex.  In contrast, the Brazilian 
EMBI+ spread increased a modest 15 basis points on net.  The gains in the real since 
mid-March coincide with several institutional factors, including a relaxation of some government restrictions on Brazil’s onshore currency market.  In addition, since 
March 17 Brazil’s central bank has not been offering hedging opportunities against future 
real appreciation through currency swaps, as it had been doing during February and early 
March.  The real was also supported against the do llar late in the period by an 
unexpected monetary policy tighten ing by Brazil’s central bank.

 Developments in Forei gn Industrial Countries 
 
Recent economic indicators suggest that economic growth in the major foreign economies slowed late in the first quarter fo llowing a pick up in the beginning of the 
year.  After rising briskly in Ja nuary, Japan’s industrial produc tion fell back some later in 
the quarter.  Similarly, the latest  data indicate that  the euro-area industr ial sector erased 
gains posted earlier in the year, while in the United Kingdom, industrial production 
continued to lose ground.  In contrast, the Canadian manufacturing sector showed signs 
of improvement relative to its poor performan ce in the second half of last year.   
 Demand indicators posted modest increases in the first quarter, with the gains generally 
waning as the quarter progressed.  Retail sa les in Japan and the United Kingdom receded 
somewhat recently from their stronger pace at th e start of the year a nd retail sales in the 
euro area firmed.    Consumer price inflation remained subdued ove rall. In the euro area, core inflation 
posted its slowest rate since early 2001, while  in Canada consumer prices continued 
rising at moderate rates.  Even though the inflation rate in the United Kingdom moved up 
recently, it continued to be slightly below th e Bank of England’s 2 percent target.  Mild 
deflation persisted in Japan.  In Japan , monthly indicators during the first qua rter have been volatile, mainly as a 
result of a shift in the Lunar New Year to Fe bruary this year from January last year.  
Averaging through this shift, the data suggest  some strengthening in economic activity in 
the first quarter.  Average i ndustrial production for the firs t quarter was up 1.7 percent 
from the fourth-quarter average, and inventor ies of high-tech goods have eased back from 
recent highs .  The all-industries index of output fo r January and February on average was 
up nearly 2 percent from the fourth-quarter average.  Wo rkers' household expenditures 
and retail sales fell in February and March but were still up for the first quarter as a whole 
due to a spike in January.  Real exports and im ports both rose slightly in the first quarter.  
Core machinery orders, a l eading indicator of busine ss investment, were roughly 
unchanged in January and February co mpared with the fourth quarter. 
 
The BOJ’s Tankan diffusion index of busine ss conditions for firms of all sizes and 
industries declined to -2 in March from 1 in December.  Survey respondents projected 
that the index would remain steady at this level in June.  The headline index for large 
manufacturers dropped to 14 in March from 22 in December, while indices for small- and 
IV-15 
medium-sized manufacturing firms fell slightly  less.  In contrast, confidence among firms 
in the non-manufacturing sector showed a small improvement.    
Labor markets have gradually improved, but  deflation continued.  In March, the 
unemployment rate fell to 4.5 pe rcent, returning to its lowe st level since late 1998.  The 
job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of  employment, remained at a thirteen-
year high in March.  Core consumer goods pric es in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh 
food but include energy) were unchanged in April from the previous month, and were 
down 0.5 percent from a year ea rlier.  Wholesale price infl ation ticked up to 1.4 percent 
in March.

Euro-area  economic indicators generall y point to a slowing of gr owth late in the first 
quarter after a pickup early in  the quarter.  Euro-area i ndustrial production declined 0.5 
percent in February, following gains in the pr evious two months.  I ndicators of business 
sentiment suggested a further weakening of activity in March.  The manufacturing PMI 
moved sharply lower in March, although the services PMI re mained steady.  The German 
IFO index fell in March and April, and the European Commission’s  index of euro-area 
business sentiment declined for the fourth consecutive month in March to the lowest level since December 2003.  The index of euro-area consumer sentiment turned lower as well 
in March, raising some concern that consum er spending, which supported GDP growth in 
the fourth quarter, could be slowing.  Eu ro-area retail sales gained 0.3 percent in 
February, the same as in the previous month, but French household consumption of 
manufactured products declined in February  following a strong gain in the previous 
month.

Labor market conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate 
rising a bit to 8.9 percent in February.  In Germany, the unemployment rate rose further 
to 12.0 percent in March, up from 10.8 percent in December.  However, according to the German Federal Statistical Office, the recent surge in measured unemployment is mostly 
attributable to the implementation of the Hartz IV laws, as welfare recipients able to work 
now are counted as unemployed. 
IV-17 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation in the euro area remained at 2.1 
percent in March.  The rate of core in flation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, 
held steady at 1.6 percent, the same as in Febr uary, which itself was the slowest rate since 
early 2001.    Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 2.2 percent in the firs t quarter, according to the 
preliminary estimate.  Service sector activity grew 3.3 percen t while industrial production 
fell slightly, both roughly in-line with their fourth-quarter pace.  Construction output 
grew by 2.6 percent, well below its fourth-qua rter growth rate of 4.7 percent.  Business 
confidence has recovered, on balance, from its  slump in the fourth quarter.  Consumer 
confidence, after remaining subdue d through the fourth quarter a nd first part of this year, 
increased above zero, its long-run average,  in March.  The PMI for services was 
unchanged over the first quarter, although manufacturing and construction PMIs fell 
slightly.    Depending on the survey consulted, house prices grew between 4 and 6 percent (a.r.) in 
the first quarter, slightly highe r than in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Consistent with the 
increase in house prices, household net mort gage borrowing rose somewhat faster over 
January and February than in the fourth quarter .  The growth rate of  mortgage lending is 
still well below its 2003 peak.  The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation jumped to 1.9 percent in March from 
1.6 percent in February, remaining just belo w the Bank of England’s 2 percent target.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation excl uding energy also incr eased sharply to 1.5 
percent in March, from 1.2 percent in February.  In its February Inflation Report,  the 
Bank of England forecast inflation, using market expectations for interest rates, to edge 
just above the target at a two-year horizon. 
 The U.K. labor market remains very tight.  Over the twelve months ending in March, earnings grew 5.6 percent for the whole econo my and rose 7.2 percent in the private 
services sector.  Producer input prices have  also accelerated, growing nearly 12 percent 
on a twelve-month basis in March.

In Canada , incoming data point to a pickup in gr owth in the first quarter, after a 
deceleration in the fourth quarter.  In January, GDP by industry advanced 2.8 percent 
(a.r.), lifted by surges in manu facturing and retail trade.  
 The manufacturing sector, which is heavily export-oriented and wa s hard hit during the 
third and fourth quarters of 2004, turned up in January and February.  Manufacturing 
output was buoyed by solid demand for machin ery and equipment, suggesting sustained 
momentum from the fourth-quarter’s strong growth in business investment.  Through the 
first two months, manufacturing shipments, ne w orders, and unfilled orders all rose on 
balance.  In addition, the ma nufacturing sub-index in the composite index of leading 
indicators suggests that manu facturing new orders may have surged again in March. 
 In February, the merchandise trade balan ce rebounded sharply, as  exports across all 
major categories increased and imports declin ed slightly.  The recovery follows steep 
IV-19 
declines in the trade balance during the prev ious two months.  In addition, while overall 
imports fell, imports of machinery and equi pment continued their recent strength, as 
businesses seem to be taking advantage of the stronger currency to add to capacity.  
 Retail sales surged for the second consecutive month in February, and the composite 
index of leading indicators advanced  for the fourth straight month  in March.  Housing 
starts remained strong in the first quarte r, despite coming off a 17-year high in 2004.

Total employment was essentially unchanged in March, but the unemployment rate edged 
down to 6.9 percent as fewer indi viduals were looking for work.   The manufacturing 
sector, which has shed about 2 percent of its workforce since the middle of 2004, also 
saw virtually no change in employment in  March, although it posted a sizable drop in 
employment overall in the first quarter.   In March, the twelve-month ra te of consumer price inflat ion moved up to 2.3 percent, 
largely due to higher gasoline prices.   The twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding 
the eight most volatile components, also edged up in March to 1.9 percent, from 1.8 
percent in February.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data from the emerging market economie s have been mixed and on average point 
to a moderation of growth in the first quarter.  The economies of China, Hong Kong, 
Korea, Mexico, and Argentina have all show n signs of strength, while the economies of 
Brazil, the ASEAN countries, and India appe ar to have moderated.  Consumer price 
inflation has moved up in general since the last Greenbook, reflecting higher oil prices.  
Several countries have responde d with monetary tightening. 
 Chinese  real GDP surged 14 percent in the first quarter, led by strong growth in exports 
and investment.  The first-quart er growth figure is surprising in light of numerous other 
indicators that point to slowing, including industrial production, imports, the money 
supply, and bank lending.  Moreover, consumer  price inflation moved down a bit in the 
first quarter, to less than 3 percent.  The re surgence of investment  growth, after three 
quarters of weak performance, implies that additional tightening measures may be needed 
in order to bring investment onto a more su stainable growth path.  The trade surplus 
widened significantly in the fi rst quarter, as exports continue d to soar and import growth 
slowed considerably.

Consumer prices have picked up in recent months due to higher oil and gas prices.

In Korea , incoming data suggest a modest improve ment in domestic demand.  Real GDP 
expanded 3.8 percent in the fourth quarte r, boosted by exports, inventory accumulation, 
and the strongest growth in private consumpti on in more than two years.  In the first 
quarter, industrial production rose  1 percent, while retail sales and indicators of consumer 
confidence and business expecta tions moved up noticeably.  Av eraging over the first two 
IV-25 
months of the year, the current account surp lus has roughly matched that of the fourth 
quarter, as the effects of the rising value of the won in foreign exchange markets and high 
fuel prices have been offset by strong external demand.  Both  headline and core 
consumer prices were unchanged in March, leaving twelve-month co re inflation within 
the government’s target range of 2.5-3.5 percent.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries suggest that economic growth generally 
moderated in the first quarter.  In Singapore,  the advance estimate of first-quarter real 
GDP (unofficial) indicates a decline of al most 6 percent, mostly due to a sharp 
contraction in the volatile biom edical sector.  However, a strong electronic s PMI reading 
for the first quarter is more encouragi ng.  Elsewhere in the region, recent data on 
industrial production have been mixed.  While production fell in Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand, it was up in Ma laysia.  Recent data show the ASEAN 
economies continuing, on average, to run trad e surpluses.  The exception is Thailand, 
where higher oil prices have contributed to consecutive monthly trade deficits. 
 Consumer price inflation remained elevated  across the region, partly reflecting higher 
energy prices and the reduction of oil subsid ies in some countries. Citing concerns over 
higher inflation, the central banks in the Phil ippines and Indonesia ra ised interest rates 
25 basis points in early April following a simila r rate increase by the Thai central bank in 
March.

In India , economic growth appears to be modera ting.  After surging almost 20 percent 
(a.r.) in the third quarter, real GDP was flat in the f ourth quarter, and industrial 
production in the first two months of this ye ar was slightly below the fourth-quarter 
average.  The trade deficit widened further in the first quarter.  Infl ation continues to be 
above market expectations, and the Indian cen tral bank raised its benchmark short-term 
interest rate to 5 percent in  late April.  The Indian gove rnment transitioned to a long-
awaited VAT tax regime at the beginning of April.  The tax, adopted by two-thirds of 
India’s states, is intended to promote growth  by streamlining the tax system, reducing the 
incidence of evasion, and unifying tax polic ies across states.  Ev en with this tax, 
however, the government’s proposed budget for the current fiscal year fails to reduce the 
deficit to levels required by Indian law.

In Mexico , recent data releases point to a cont inued healthy pace of economic activity.  
The country’s index of overall economic ac tivity (a monthly proxy for real GDP) rose 
6.2 percent in February from its year-earlier level, on the back of solid performances of 
the service and industrial s ectors.  Average industria l production for January and 
February was up 1 percent from the four th-quarter average, boosted by strong 
maquiladora production.  Domestic demand has c ontinued to be an important source of 
growth, aided by increasing bank credit despite relatively high real interest rates. 
 In late March, the Bank of Mexico tightened monetary policy for the twelfth time in the 
past year in an ongoing effort to tame inflation and signal its  commitment to its inflation 
target.  The rate on 28-day pe so-denominated bills, the Cete s, currently stands at about 
9.6 percent, up from about 5 percent when  tightening began early last year.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation stood at 4.4 percent in the first quarter, down 
from 5.3 percent at the end of the fourth qua rter of 2004, but still a bove the target range 
of 2-4 percent.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook  point to a softening of activity.  
Industrial production declined 1.2 percent in February, brin ging the January-February 
average slightly below its fourth-quarter level.   February retail sale s were weak, and auto 
IV-29 
sales were down in the first quarter.  The exte rnal sector was the bright spot, as the trade 
surplus grew in the first quarter, with nomina l exports up nearly 25 pe rcent at an annual 
rate.  Headline consumer price inflati on was 0.6 percent in March, bringing the 
twelve-month increase to about 7½ percent,  well above the central bank’s target of 
5 percent for 2005.  Monthly core inflation, wh ich excludes food and administered prices, 
has also been high, but slowed in March.  Since mid-March, the central bank has raised its policy rate, the Selic, 75 basis points, to 
19.5 percent in a bid to reduce inflation.  The latest hike of 25 basis points on April 20 
surprised analysts, who had expected an end of  the tightening that began last fall.  The 
central bank’s tight monetary  policy has been increasingly controversial and is partly 
responsible for efforts by some to remove Central Bank President Mereilles from his 
post.

In Argentina , the economic recovery continued in th e fourth quarter of last year, with 
real GDP expanding at an annual rate of ove r 11 percent.  In the first quarter of 2005, 
industrial production con tinued to expand briskly, with the first-quarter average 3 percent 
above its fourth-quarter level.  The unemploy ment rate has steadily fallen over the past 
few years, reaching about 12 percent in the four th quarter, half of what it was at the peak 
of the 2001-02 financial crisis.  Food pri ce increases pushed twelve-month consumer 
price inflation to over 9 percent in March, above the upper end of the central bank’s 
unofficial target range of 5-8 percent for 2005.

The final settlement of the Argentine governme nt’s February debt exchange, originally 
scheduled for April 1, has been delayed in re sponse to legal action pursued by a group of 
bondholders who did not accept the swap offer and who seek to freeze assets in the 
United States owned by the Argentine govern ment.  The case is currently pending a 
decision in U.S. courts.  It remains to be seen how the Argentine government will 
ultimately deal with investors holding almost  $20 billion (about 25 percent) in defaulted 
bonds who did not accept the government’s offer.

In Venezuela , there have been few data rele ases since the last Greenbook.  
Unemployment declined in the first quarte r but remained high, and monthly inflation 
jumped to 1.2 percent in March (n.s.a.) in the wake of the March devaluation of the 
bolivar.  Fiscal policy continue s to be expansionary, supporte d by the high price of oil.  
International reserves stood at  about $26 billion in mid-Apr il, up a little since end-2004.  
Oil production is still estimated to be belo w the level prevailing before the national 
strikes of 2002.
