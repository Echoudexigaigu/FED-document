Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Overview 
Although the data have been uneven, the econo my appears to have been expanding at a 
moderate pace in recent months .  Manufacturing production posted a solid gain in May.  
Consumer spending is on track for another mode rate gain in the current quarter, and the 
housing market remains strong:  Home sales ha ve been brisk, and residential construction 
activity remained at a high level in May.  Labor demand continued to expand, albeit 
erratically, in April and May, and the unemployment rate edge d down further.  Core CPI 
inflation slowed in April and May.  
 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor demand has increased at a moderate p ace, on balance, in recent months.  Private 
nonfarm payrolls rose 73,000 in May follo wing an increase of 261,000 in April; the 
average monthly gain of 153,000 jobs over the past three months is on par with the 
average for the six months before that .  Among major industries, construction, 
transportation and utilities, and nonbusiness serv ices have been expandi ng payrolls in line 
with their recent trends, while hiring in fina ncial activities and prof essional and business 
services has slowed a bit.  Th e manufacturing sector has poste d further small job losses.   
 The average workweek of production or nons upervisory workers moved up 0.1 hour in 
April to 33.8 hours and remained at that hi gher level in May.  After having surged 
0.6 percent in April, aggregate hours of produc tion or nonsupervisory workers rose just 
0.1 percent in May to reach its highest level since March 2001. 
 The unemployment rate dipped to 5.1 percent in May and now stands ¼ percentage point 
below its average in the four th quarter of 2004.  Meanwhile, the labor force participation 
rate moved up, to 66.1 percent.  The increase  in participation between March and May 
suggests that the labor market has strengthe ned enough to attract some individuals back 
into the workforce.  Indeed, the percen tage of household employment made up of 
individuals unemployed less than five weeks w ho are new entrants and reentrants to the 
labor market has moved up noticeably over the past several months.   
 Other indicators of labor market  activity also imply that sl ack is diminishing gradually.  
The share of individuals working part-time for economic reasons has drifted lower since 
the fourth quarter of 2004.  The four-week moving average of new claims for unemployment insurance, at 335,000 in the we ek ending June 11, remains in the narrow 
range that has prevailed since the start of the year.  The exhaustion rate—the proportion 
of workers leaving the unemployment insuran ce rolls after using thei r entire period of

eligibility—edged down in May and has fallen by approximately ½ percentage point over 
the past year.  In May, 23 percent of fi rms reporting to the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses said that they ha d a hard-to-fill positi on, down 1 percentage 
point from February and Marc h, but 1 percentage point above  the average reading in the 
second half of last year.  Households’ asse ssments of job availability rose gradually 
through the first quarter and have remained n ear their recent high si nce then.  Similarly, 
job openings as a percent of private employment, as measured by the JOLTS, rose from 
2.5 percent last summer to 2.8 percent in Fe bruary, and the reading has remained steady 
in recent months.  At the same time, the help wanted index is currently above the level posted at the end of last year, although it reced ed a bit in April and May from February’s 
recent high.  Looking ahead, hiring plans of small businesse s popped up in May from their depressed 
levels in March and April.  Meanwhile, the th ird-quarter net hiring plans of participants 
in the Manpower survey are unchanged at the relatively high leve l that has prevailed 
during the first half of the year.  Coinciding with the relatively positive hiring indicators, households’ views of the future have brighten ed a touch in recent  weeks.  Household 
expectations of the labor market, as measur ed by the Michigan survey, bounced back to 
first-quarter levels in June following weak readings in April a nd May.  The Conference 
Board measure of expected labor market condit ions also improved a bit in the most recent 
reading for May but has moved little on balance in recent months.

We now estimate that productivity  in the nonfarm business sector  rose at an annual rate 
of 3.5 percent in the first quarter, followi ng an increase of 2.3 pe rcent in the fourth 
quarter.  Over the four quarters ending in  2005:Q1, productivity in creased 2.7 percent by 
our estimate—half the blistering pace record ed during the preceding four quarters but 
close to the average rate of increase since 1995.  We also estimate that output per hour in 
the nonfinancial corporate sector  rose 3 percent in the first quarter to a level 5 percent 
higher than a year earlier—the latter rate is only a shade below the 5.1 percent increase 
recorded over the four quarters ending in 2004:Q1.1 
 
Industrial Production 
Industrial production increased 0.4 percent in May after having  declined 0.3 percent in 
April.  The increase in May was led by a ga in of 0.6 percent in manufacturing output.  
Production in mining edged up 0.1 percent last month, while the output of utilities fell 
0.7 percent.  Excluding motor vehicles a nd parts, manufacturing production expanded 
0.6 percent in May after having advanced li ttle during the preceding three months. 
 The production of motor vehicles and part s was unchanged in May after a cumulative 
decline of 5.1 percent in March and April.  Manufacturers con tinued their efforts to work 
off inventories of light truc ks by holding down light vehicle assemblies in May to an 
annual rate of 11.0 million units, the slowest pace since October 2001.  However, despite the lower assembly rates recently, days’ s upply edged down to only 71 days in May from 
an average of 74 days in the first quarter.  The pace of assemblies of medium and heavy 
trucks has also come down in recent months, but this decline is from a level in January 
that was the highest since February 1980.
2  For June, total motor vehicle assemblies are 
set at an 11.9 million unit pace reflecting a sizable step-up in light truck production.  
Third-quarter schedules currently point to a pace of 11.8 million units. 
                                                 
1 Output for the nonfinancial corp orate sector, used in construction of the output per hour measure 
shown in the table, is measured on the income side of the national accounts, while output in the nonfarm business sector is measured on the product side of the accounts.  
2 Moreover, at a recent symposium, an industry expert from the Americas Commercial Transportation 
Research Company sugg ested that the recent slackening in produc tion reflected, at least in part, delayed 
delivery of selected parts and that replacem ent demand for heavy trucks was still strong.

Elsewhere in the transporta tion sector, production has been  buoyant.  The IP index for 
commercial aircraft jumped at an annual rate of 25 percent in the first quarter, and robust 
output gains in April and May have put th e industry on track for another significant 
increase in the second quarter.  
. 
 In the high-tech sector, recent news about  semiconductor production has been mostly 
positive.  Shipments of semiconductors in the first four months of the year exceeded industry expectations, and the Semiconducto r Industry Association (SIA) raised its 
forecast of worldwide nominal shipments for 2005 from no change to an increase of 
6 percent.
3  Nonetheless, this forecast, coming on the heels of the solid output gains early 
in the year, actually implies some decline in the rate of increase in the near-term.  
Similarly, although Intel upgraded its revenue guidance for the second quarter, that guidance still shows some slowing in the seasonally adjusted rate of increase relative to the first quarter.  Orders for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which are heavily 
influenced by the introduction of each new ge neration of semiconductor chips, have been  
                                                
 
3 Other outside forecasts of semic onductor shipments have been revise d up similarly in recent weeks.

about flat in recent months; moreover, industr y observers have suggested that orders will 
fall a bit further in 2005 and 2006 befo re picking up again in 2007 and 2008. 
 Elsewhere in the tech sector, computer pr oduction has been increas ing roughly 1 percent 
per month, a pace that is well below the average gain in the latter ha lf of the 1990s.  Unit 
sales of personal computers (PCs) moved down in the first quarter, while the latest 
outlook from Gartner suggests th at unit sales may edge up in the second quarter.  Within 
total PC sales, the increase in desktop sales continues to lag the more rapid sales pace for mobile PCs, of which fewer are domestically produced.  Unit sales of computer servers 
continue to trend up steadily, but some industry reports suggest these gains may start 
slowing.  Indeed, diffusion indexes of future  business spending plans for computers and 
data networking equipment, though volatile, ha ve edged down over the past year.  In 
contrast, the production of co mmunications equipment, which has trended up since its 
trough in late 2002, may receive some added im petus from the continued rollout of new 
products designed for telecommunications se rvice providers and other enterprises.
4 
 Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts,  and high-tech products, production gains 
were widespread in May.  The output of equipment—both for business and for defense 
and space—has continued to trend upward, and the production of consumer goods, which had been moving sideways of late, increased  ½ percent in May.  Among upstream market 
groups, the combined output of business and construction supplies in creased at an annual 
rate of 4.6 percent in the first quarter and has been rising in the second quarter.  In 
contrast, the output of material s designated for further proce ssing in the industrial sector 
increased in May but has been little cha nged, on balance, since October 2004.  Within 
this grouping, the production of  iron and steel was curtai led sharply in April, as 
inventories at steel service centers continue d to rise in response  to relatively flat 
shipments.  Overall, the manufacturing u tilization rate in May, at 78.2 percent, was 1.6 percentage 
points below its 1972-2004 average.

4 Examples include equipment that better handles the complex routing requirements of voice traffic 
over the Internet and products that bundle functions su ch as data, security, and voice handling into a single 
piece of equipment. 
5 Industries whose utilization rates remain below their long-run averages include, among others, 
textiles and apparel; converted paper product; printing and related support activities; fabricated metal 
product; furniture and related product; and communications equipment.  Industries with above-average 
rates of utilization include motor vehicles and part s as well as several upstream industries such as

between February and May, it has risen fairly  steadily over the past two years.  In 
contrast, the Institute for Supply Management  (ISM) supplier delive ries diffusion index 
has fallen sharply; this index had jumped in  2004 in response to tight conditions in the 
freight transportation sector.  The recent behavior of these two series resembles the 
experience of the early 1980s.    Recent indicators of industrial activity have been mixed but are generally consistent with 
modest near-term gains.  Thus far in June , the available weekly indicators of production 
have been positive:  The pace of motor vehicle assemblies has picked up; electricity generation has risen because of unseasonably wa rm weather in June (following a cooler-
than-usual May); and other weekly physical pr oduct data, with the exception of that for 
steel, have risen, on balance, relative to May.  Looking ahead, indicators of new orders 
activity have been less upbeat .  Although the new orders diffusion index from the New 
York Fed’s Empire State Survey in June part ly reversed its recent string of declines, the 
Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey posted a sizable drop after having edged 
down in May; that said, both se ries were above 50 in June.  In addition, the three-month 
moving average of the staff’s series on real  adjusted durable goods  orders was unchanged 
in March and April.  
Motor Vehicles 
Light vehicle sales fell 800,000 units in May to an annual rate of 16.6 million units.  
Nonetheless, the average pace of sales in Ap ril and May still exceed ed the first-quarter 
average, despite the fact that incentives were  a little less rich, on av erage, over the period  
than they were in the first quarter.  Conf idential reports from vehicle manufacturers 
suggest that sales are rebounding in June primarily in respons e to temporary price cuts by 
General Motors (GM).  To clear out inventories of its 2005 model- year vehicles, GM made its generous 
employee discount on new vehicle purchases available to the ge neral public through 
July 5.
6  The price cut, which may be combined  with other incentives , shaves 17 percent 
                                                 
petroleum and coal products; pulp, paper, and paperboard; and cement and concrete product.   
In addition, the publication of industrial production for May included updated estimates of industrial 
capacity for 2005.  The increase in total industrial capac ity from the fourth quarter of 2004 to the fourth 
quarter of 2005 was revised down 0.1 percentage point, to 1.2 percent; manufacturing was revised down similarly, to 1.4 percent. 
6 The offer applies to all 2005 mode l-year cars (except the Corvette) and to most light trucks.  The 
price cut is not included in J.D. Power’s estimat e of incentives, which includes only cash rebates and 
interest subvention.

from GM’s suggested retail pri ces of the targeted vehicles.7  Information from J.D. Power 
and Associates through June 12 suggests that the program appears to have significantly  
boosted sales of GM’s sport utility vehicl es and pickups.  Perhaps because other 
manufacturers expect GM’s unusually large pric e cut to be short-lived, they have not yet 
moved aggressively to compete by enriching their own incentives. 
 After an abrupt drop in April, the market sh are of domestically produced vehicles edged 
up to 80.3 percent in May but remained below its level a year earlier.  That modest 
slippage masks a more serious erosion of market share for the Big Three nameplates, 
particularly GM, whose market share has tumbled 1.5 percentage points since May 2004.

Consumer Spending 
Real personal consumption expenditures are on tr ack to increase at a moderate pace in the 
current quarter, albeit at a bit less than the 3½ percent (annual ra te) rate posted  in the first 
quarter.  Purchases of motor vehicles have mo re than recovered from their decline in the 
first quarter.  At the same time, however, real  outlays for goods excluding cars and trucks 
seem to have decelerated this quarter ag ainst a backdrop of somewhat lackluster 
fundamentals.  Nominal retail sales at the control group of stores, which excludes automotive dealers and 
building materials and supply stores, fell last month, as did spending at  most categories of 
retail outlets.  Howeve r, with prices of non-auto cons umer goods having fallen in May, 
we estimate that real spending on goods excl uding cars and trucks was unchanged after a 
jump of 0.6 percent in the prev ious month.  Real spending on services was flat in April, 
the most recent month for which data are available.  Expenditures on energy services 
dropped because of cooler-than-normal temp eratures; outlays for non-energy services 
were also tepid.    As a result of rising energy prices and only moderate improvements in the labor market, 
the rate of increase in real disposable income  slowed this spring after strong gains (even 
abstracting from the extraordinarily large di vidend payment by Microsoft) in late 2004 
                                                
 
7 Because vehicle prices tend to drop over a model- year’s selling season, the impact of GM’s program 
on the actual transactions price of GM ve hicles is less than the employee discount. 
8 Domestic market share excludes foreign-produced vehicles (such as Saab, which is sold by GM). 
9 The manufacturers other than the Big Three with light vehicle production capacity in the U.S. are 
BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota.

and early this year.  With spending outpaci ng income thus far this year, the personal 
saving rate has moved down, to only ½ percent in April (its most recent reading).  The 
stock market has been about flat , on net, since the st art of the year, but house prices have  
continued to appreciate ra pidly; we estimate that ove rall household net worth has 
increased roughly in line with income over the course of the fi rst two quarters.  
 The Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC)  index of consumer sentiment rebounded in 
early June after having declined noticeably in April and May.  The Conference Board 
index of consumer confidence moved up in May (the most recent reading).  Both indexes 
appear to have been held down in April by the jump in energy prices but have moved 
back up recently as gasoline prices fell for a time.  
Housing 
Activity in the housing sector remains strong.  Si ngle-family starts were at an annual rate 
of 1.70 million units in May, in line with thei r first-quarter average and about 5 percent 
above the average pace last year.  Permits for single-family homes—after adjusting for 
activity in areas where permits are not requ ired—were issued at an annual rate of 
1.65 million units in May, a little above the firs t-quarter pace, and the backlog of unused 
permits edged down.  Starts of multifamily  dwellings fell to an annual pace of 
305,000 units in May, a rate well below the aver age pace over the past year.  Altogether, 
the permits data suggest that total starts ma y decline slightly in June but remain at a 
robust level.     Sales of both new and existing homes climbed to record highs in April.  Sales of single-
family existing homes were at an annual ra te of 6.28 million units in April, while new 
homes sold at a 1.32 million unit pace.  Housing demand is undoubtedly receiving considerable support from favorable fina ncing conditions.  The thirty-year fixed 
mortgage rate has declined in recent weeks, and the mid-June level of 5.6 percent is at the 
low end of the range observed since the spring of 2004.  In addition, the one-year 
adjustable mortgage rate has risen only about  35 basis points during the past year.  The 
four-week moving average of mo rtgage applications to purchase homes has been at an 
elevated level in recent weeks, suggesting that  home sales will remain strong in June and 
July.  Prices of existing homes continue to increas e rapidly, while prices of new homes appear 
to have decelerated.  In the market for ex isting homes, the OFHEO purchase-only repeat-

excludes appraisals from refi nancings—was 10¼ percent higher in the first quarter than a 
year earlier, continuing the steep climb that  has prevailed since la te 2003.  The average 
sales price of existing homes has shown a simila r pattern.  In contrast , in the market for  
new homes, the constant-quality price i ndex—which controls for changes in the 
geographic composition of sales, home si ze, and a few other readily measurable 
attributes—was up about 4½ percent in the firs t quarter from a year  earlier, noticeably 
slower than the gain of more than 7½ per cent during the previous four-quarter period.  
Average sales prices of new ho mes have also decelerated.  
  
Equipment and Software 
After having climbed at a heady annual rate of  18 percent in the sec ond half of last year, 
real outlays for equipment and software incr eased at a more-moderate  7 percent pace in 
the first quarter.  Although business purchase s of high-tech goods surged last quarter, 
spending on transportation equipment and ot her equipment fell back following large 
gains in 2004.  Available data for the current quarter suggest that equipment and software 
expenditures will likely register another moderate increase.  More broadly, the 
fundamentals remain supportive of business investment:  The user cost of capital is low, 
business output is rising briskly, and corpor ate balance sheets are healthy.  In addition, 
surveys of business leaders indicate that capital spending sentiment remains relatively favorable.  Real business spending on transportation equi pment stumbled in the first quarter.  
Although we expect a rebound in deliveries of  aircraft to domestic purchasers in the 
current quarter, investment in motor vehicles appears set for another quarterly decline.  
Business purchases of light ve hicles are estimated to have  edged down in May, and sales 
of medium and heavy trucks also declined.  Net new orders for medi um and heavy trucks 
ticked up in May but have moved lower, on bala nce, since the turn of the year—signaling 
that demand may ease a bit further in coming months, albeit from an elevated level.  
Order backlogs are still at high levels, and industry reports point to rising prices as 
evidence that overall demand (p articularly for class-8 h eavy trucks) remains strong.

 Real outlays for high-tech equipment and soft ware increased at a robust annual rate of 
28 percent in the first quarter, but the recen t orders and shipments data paint a mixed 
picture of spending in this category in th e current quarter.  Nominal shipments of 
computers rose 6 percent in Ap ril, and orders leaped 16 perc ent.  Coupled with ongoing

rapid price declines, real sp ending for computers is poised to increase appreciably this 
quarter.  In contrast, a plunge of 11 percen t in shipments of communications equipment 
and a drop of 4 percent in orders in April suggest that real outla ys in this category 
arelikely to fall in the curren t quarter.  Although most large so ftware vendors have not yet 
released earnings updates for the second qua rter, surveys of CIOs indicate that 
replacement purchases of software should continue to support strong gains in real 
spending.  Real outlays for non-high-tech, nontransportation equipment declined at an annual rate of 
2 percent in the first quarter.  The source of th is weakness is unclear.  Indeed, some of the 
softness in the first quarter occurred in sub categories such as construction machinery and 
mining and oilfield machinery, in which fi nal users clearly face favorable economic 
conditions.  The first-quarter decline may have  reflected, in part, the expiration of the 
partial-expensing allowances  at the end of 2004, or it may have represented a pause 
following a spurt in spending that  was unrelated to partial expe nsing.  In either case, the 
downturn appears to have been short lived:  Shipments of non-high-tech, 
nontransportation equipment rose 1.6 percent in April, and the le vel of new orders 
remained well above the level of shipments.  
Nonresidential Construction  
Real outlays for construction of  nonresidential structures have remained at a low level so 
far this year.  Although spending on commerc ial structures has moved up in recent 
months, outlays for office buildings have rema ined at a depressed level despite a small 
decline in the elevated vacancy rate for that sector.  In addition, spending for manufacturing structures still is less than half the level seen in 1999 despite some uptrend 
over the past year, and other construction ha s continued to fall.  The number of rigs 
drilling for natural gas still is moving up, but  drilling for petroleum has remained weak. 
 
Business Inventories  
The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles 
increased at an annual rate of $100 billion in the first quar ter.  However, the pace of 
stockbuilding cooled off some in April—firm s added about $41 billion in book value to 
their inventories in that month.  The large build up of inventories in the first quarter raised 
inventory-sales ratios a little from their very lo w levels of last year.  In the manufacturing 
sector, respondents to the ISM survey repor t that they now view their customers’ 
inventory positions as roughly appropriate after having seen them as too lean last year.  
Data from the staff's flow-o f-goods inventory system indicat e that inventories declined

for a second month in April and that da ys’ supply edged down.  Apart from the high 
levels of stocks at motor vehicle dealer s and steel service centers noted earlier, 
inventories appear elevated re lative to consumption only for paper and, to a lesser degree, 
for food and chemicals (excluding pharmaceuticals).  
Federal Government Sector  
According to recent monthly Treasury statem ents, individual and corporate income tax 
receipts have surged over the past few m onths.  In response, the Congressional Budget 
Office reduced its projection for the baseline  unified deficit (adjusted for spending on 
Iraq) in the current fiscal year  from around $400 billion as of the beginning of the year to 
roughly $350 billion currently.  Receipts during the April-May tax season, wh ich were nearly 30 percent higher than 
year-earlier levels, were boosted by a jump in  individual nonwithheld  income taxes that 
mostly reflected final payments on 2004 income  tax liability.  Roughly one-third to one-
half of the surge in individual nonwithheld ta xes (net of refunds) reflected a recovery 
from the temporarily depressed level last year  associated with the effects of the 2003 tax 
bill.
11  In addition, individual withheld and FI CA taxes increased at  a robust pace during 
the first five months of this year.  On the corporate side, income taxes were up markedly 
during the April-May period relative to year -earlier levels because  of the strength in 
corporate income and, likely to a lesser exte nt, the expiration of the partial-expensing 
provision at the end of last y ear.  Further, daily data fo r June indicate a substantial 
increase in corporate declarations relative to last year’s level.  Outlays, after adjusting for financial transac tions and payment timing shifts, have picked 
up a bit of late, outpacing their increase of about 6½ percent in the year ending this May.  
Net interest and Medicare continued to post sizable gains.  In contrast, the pace of 
defense spending has cooled off a bit recently.  
                                                
 
11 The 2003 tax act was passed in midyear but was made retroactive to the beginning of 2003.  
However, because tax withholding rate s were lowered to their new permanen t levels in July of that year, 
the reduction in liability exceeded the reduction in withhe ld taxes in 2003.  Thus, some of the reduction in 
2003 liability showed up as lower final payments and higher refunds during the tax season in 2004.  In addition to the effects of the 2003 tax act, this year’s  surge in net final payments likely reflects a host of 
other factors that could include faster gains in labor and capital income, higher capital gains realizations, 
and a shift in the distribution of taxable income toward the higher end.  Given the available data, their 
relative contributions are difficult to quantify. 
II-28 
II-29 
State and Local Governments   
Recent indicators suggest that the fiscal situation of state and local governments 
continues to improve and th at real spending is back on a gradual uptrend.  Although 
nominal construction spending has continued to  trend up recently, rapid increases in the 
costs of construction have held down real outla ys in recent quarters.  In April, nominal 
construction spending rose 0.2 percent (monthl y rate) to a level 1.1 percent above its 
first-quarter average, a performance consistent  with a modest real gain this quarter.  
Much of the April increase was in outlays for public safety and sewer facilities, while outlays for highways have fallen back from  highs reported during the first quarter.  
Hiring by state and local governments has been  on an upward path for almost a year; 
however, the April-May average rise of 12,000 was toward the low end of the range seen 
since last summer.  
 Meanwhile, recent reports corroborate earlie r signs of strengthening state government 
finances.  Tax collections have been quite st rong this spring, and personal income tax 
collections in April and May appear to have  been coming in above expectations in many 
states.  In addition, most states seem likely to  finish the current fi scal year, which ends 
June 30 in all but four states, with so lid surpluses in their general fund accounts.
12   This 
would follow a year of rising balances:  Th e National Conference of  State Legislatures 
recently reported that aggregate general fund year-end balances—which include both 
cash on hand and rainy-day funds—rose in fiscal 2004 for the first time since 2000.  However,  even with relatively strong collectio ns in hand, some states  still have concerns 
about Medicaid and about the need to restor e funding to programs that were pared back 
earlier in the decade.  
Prices   
As energy prices reversed part of their earlier run-up, consumer  prices were about 
unchanged in May after having posting large in creases in the previous few months.  
Excluding food and energy, the rise in infl ation in the first part of the year ―noted in the 
April Greenbook ―appears to have moderated a touch in April and May.  Despite the 
moderation, core PCE prices are still estimated to have increas ed at an annual rate of 
2.5 percent in the three months ending in May; they are up 1 .8 percent since May of last 
year, a little above the rise of 1.5 percent in the compar able period one year earlier.

The CPI for energy fell 2 percent in May, as a dip in crude oil prices showed through to 
the retail level.  However, with crude o il prices having rebounded since the end of May, 
survey data suggest that reta il gasoline prices have risen— even though margins appear to 
have fallen back.  The high price of crude oil has induced some substitution toward natural gas by industrial users, which has pus hed up the consumer price of natural gas as 
well.  All told, consumer energy prices rose  10 percent during the twelve months through 
May.    Food prices in the CPI edged up 0.1 percent in  May after an increas e of 0.7 percent in 
April that included a pop in the index for fr uits and vegetables.  Following the drought in 
2002 and a supply-restricting rebu ilding of beef and dairy herd s, food prices have been 
increasing faster than core prices.  Still, f ood prices have decelerated over the past year, 
rising 2½ percent in the twelve months ending in May compared with a rise of 4 percent 
in the previous year.  The CPI excluding food and energy was unchange d in April and increased 0.1 percent in 
May after having risen 0.4 percent in March.  The recent volatility has resulted mainly 
from significant swings in the prices of  lodging away from home and apparel—two 
regular contributors of month-to-month vari ability.  Over the three-month period, the 
core CPI increased at an a nnual rate of 2.2 percent.   
 We estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.3 percent in May following an increase of 
0.1 percent in April.
14  Price inflation for core goods has been steady at a moderate annual 
rate of about ¾ percent in the past few m onths.  This leveling-off follows a noticeable 
acceleration in core goods prices in 2004 that likely reflected the rise in import, energy, 
and core intermediate materials prices.  At the same time, PCE prices for core consumer 
services have accelerated a bit in the past few months, but the year-over-year increase in 
May was about the same in the preceding year.  Inflation expectations appear to  have drifted down in the past two months.  The Michigan 
SRC’s preliminary report for June showed that  median year-ahead inflation expectations 
fell from 3.3 percent in April to 3.1 percent in early June, a decline that is generally  
                                                
 
14 Our expectation for core PCE price inflation in Ma y (0.3 percent) is above the published increase in 
the core CPI (0.1 percent).  Roundin g accounts for nearly half of the difference and weighting accounts for 
the remainder—in particular, the PCE index has a lower weight for lodging away from home, which fell 
sharply in May, and a higher weight for medical care services, which posted a relatively large increase in 
May.

consistent with the energy-induced movements in headline consumer price inflation.  In 
the June preliminary release, five-to-ten y ear median inflation expectations moved down 
to 2.7 percent, a reading in the lower part of the narrow range obser ved in the past few 
years.  Broader measures of inflation have picked up over the past year.  In the four quarters 
through the first quarter of 2005, GDP prices increased 2½ pe rcent, ¾ percentage point 
more than in the year-earlier period.  Excluding food and energy, GDP prices also 
increased 2½ percent over the past year, 1 pe rcentage point more th an in the previous 
year.  In broad terms, the cost pressures fr om higher energy and ma terials prices, along 
with rising demand, have shown through to a pickup in prices of capital goods and 
structures as well as in core PCE.  The PPI for capital equipment rose 0.1 percent in May after an advance of 0.2 percent in 
April.  The increase in these prices over th e twelve months ending in May, at 2½ percent, 
was noticeably faster than the 1¼ percent rate  of the preceding twelve months.  Turning 
to earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials continues to 
decelerate after having posted outsized in creases in 2004.  The three-month moving 
average has tumbled to a ¾ percent rate, well  below the 6¾ percent rate over the three 
months ending in February.  Commodities pri ces have receded slightly since the April 
Greenbook—the CRB spot industrials  index is down 1½ percent,  and the JOC industrials 
index is down 5 percent.  However, on balan ce, commodity prices have remained at an 
elevated level since the beginning of 2004.   
Labor Costs 
We estimate that compensation per hour in th e nonfarm business sector increased at an 
annual rate of 6¼ percent last quarter af ter a substantially upward-revised pace of 
10¼ percent in the final quarter of 2004.  Over the most recent four quarters, this measure 
of compensation per hour appears to have incr eased 7 percent.  Un it labor costs in the 
nonfarm business sector climbed at an annual ra te of 7¾ percent in the fourth quarter and 
at an estimated 2¾ percent rate in the first quarter.

15 Unit labor costs for the nonfinanci al corporate sector show significantly less revision than do unit 
labor costs for the nonfarm business sector.  This is in part because output for the nonfinancial corporate 
sector, used in construction of the unit labor costs m easure shown in the table, is based on income data, 
which was revised upward in the fourth quarter; data from the product side of the accounts that are used to 
construct GDP and to derive nonfarm business output were not revised.

The upward revision to fourth-quarter comp ensation, which was unusually large, reflects 
the benchmarking of private wages and salari es to the newly ava ilable fourth-quarter 
unemployment insurance tax record s.  We suspect that the jump  in the fourth quarter was 
caused, in part, by a one-time burst of st ock-option exercises and sizable year-end 
bonuses.  Confidential industry de tail shows that the upward re visions were concentrated 
in industries in which stock options a nd bonuses might be more common; four 
industries—finance and insurance, manage ment of companies and enterprises, 
information, and professional and technical se rvices—accounted for nearly half of the 
revision to wages and salaries.  Using data  currently available,  the staff’s rough and 
preliminary estimates of stock-option exerci ses for 2004 suggest a step-up in exercises 
compared with 2003, and, given the pattern  of stock price increases during 2004, 
exercises were likely concentrated in the f ourth quarter.  Also, some firms may have 
accelerated the vesting date of options to th e fourth quarter in response to the December 
2004 revision to accounting standards that woul d have required firms to start expensing 
options in 2005.16  In addition, the employment co st index (ECI) of bonuses for 
nonproduction workers rose sharply in the fi rst quarter of 2005, wh ich could reflect 
bonuses paid in late December after the survey date for the ECI.  In any event, an initial 
indication as to the persisten ce of the fourth-quarter bulge will become available at the 
end of August when the wage and salary  data for the first quarter of 2005 are 
benchmarked.    By comparison, gauges of hourly compensation aside from the measures in the Productivity and Cost release ha ve been subdued; in particular, the ECI, which does not 
include stock options, rose only 3½ percent over the four quarters ending in the first 
quarter.  Similarly, average hourly earni ngs for production or nonsupervisory workers 
have increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percen t in the past six months , essentially the same 
pace as in the preceding six-month period.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Developments in financial markets over th e intermeeting period suggest that investors 
have become more confident that the economy remains on a solid growth track with subdued inflation.  Market participants are virt ually certain of a 25 ba sis point increase in 
the target federal funds rate at the upco ming FOMC meeting and have marked up the 
expected path for policy through early next year.  Beyond that point , policy expectations 
have shifted down a bit.  Longer-term nomina l Treasury yields have declined, on net, 
while real yields on TIPS have edged up, l eaving inflation compensation lower.  Stock 
prices have posted solid ga ins.  Investment-grade co rporate spreads are largely 
unchanged, while speculative-grade spreads are down, on net, as concerns regarding the 
effects of the auto-sector downgrades in early  May subsequently subsided.  The growth 
of business debt has been moderate this quart er, while that of house holds appears to have 
remained brisk.    
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Investors largely anticipated the FOMC’s d ecision at its May mee ting to increase the 
target federal funds rate 25 basis points and to  retain the “measured pace” language in the 
statement.  The effect on financial markets of both the initially rele ased statement and the 
corrected version was limited.  The minutes of  the May meeting reportedly also contained 
few surprises for market participants, a nd subsequent comments by Federal Reserve 
officials over the intermeeting period had mixed effects on mone tary policy expectations.  
Investors evidently read economic data releas es as consistent with continued moderate 
expansion and subdued inflationary pressures.   According to futures quotes, market 
participants are virtually certain  of a 25 basis point hike in th e target federal funds rate at 
the upcoming FOMC meeting, and they place ve ry high odds on another such increase at 
the August meeting.  The expected path of the federal funds rate through the early part of 
next year edged a bit higher, but policy  expectations beyond that horizon declined 
somewhat.    Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securiti es increased almost 10 basis points.  In 
contrast, yields on ten-year nominal Treasury securities, which fell for a time to levels 
last observed early this year before back ing up, ended the period down almost 15 basis 
points, on net.  With the rise in shorter-term rates and the decrease in longer-dated yields, 
the term structure continued to flatten, although it still ma intains a moderate positive 
slope.  Despite the rise in far-dated oil fu tures prices since the last FOMC meeting, 
five-year TIPS inflation compensation adjust ed for the lag in indexation dropped about

20 basis points amid benign readings on core PPI and CPI.  Inflation compensation over 
the subsequent five years also declined around 20 basis points.  
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Incoming economic news buoyed stock prices ov er the intermeeting period, as investors 
apparently shrugged off the large rise in oi l prices.  Broad equity indexes rose about 
5 percent, on net, while shares of technology and retail companies, as well as those of 
small firms, recorded even larger increases.  The gap between the trend-adjusted twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio a nd the real long-run perpetuity Treasury 
yield—a rough measure of the equity premium—widened furthe r to a level last observed 
in early 2003.  Actual and implied volatili ties on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 
returned to historical lows after ha ving edged higher earlier this year. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  moved about in line with those on 
comparable-maturity Treasuries, leaving spread s on these securities little changed.  Credit 
spreads on speculative-grade bonds widened in the aftermath of Standard and Poor’s 
downgrade of General Motors and Ford debt in early May, but cred it quality concerns 
eased in recent weeks, and junk bond spreads finished the period a bout 25 basis points 
lower, on net.  However, these spreads rema in substantially above the low levels they 
reached in early March as concerns in the auto sector earlier this spring apparently 
prompted investors to mark up expectat ions of default and to demand greater 
compensation for bearing risk.  The yield sp read between thirty-day A2/P2 and A1/P1 
commercial paper remained low over the intermeeting period. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
The first-quarter reporting s eason drew to a close in earl y May, when retailers’ reports 
modestly surpassed investors’ expectations .  All told, operating earnings per share for 
S&P 500 firms came in about 13 percent above  results from four quarters earlier.  
Analysts’ estimates of year-ahead earn ings for S&P 500 firms were again about 
unchanged from mid-May to mid-June, with  upward revisions for the energy sector 
offsetting slight downward revisi ons for other firms.      
 
Measures of credit quality for nonfinancial firms outside of the au to sector remained 
strong.  Aggregate cash positions of nonfinancial corporations are still very large, despite 
a downtick in the first quar ter associated with con tinued rapid M&A and share 
repurchase activity.  The apprec iable rise in bond downgrades in April and May primarily 
reflected troubles in the auto sector, and co rporate bond defaults remained minimal.  The

aggregate expected year-ahead default rate  based on firm-level estimates from KMV 
continued to be low in May.  
Business Finance 
Gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corpor ations was subdued in April and May but 
has picked up in recent weeks, albeit to mode rate levels, as interest rates have declined 
and credit spreads narrowed.  C&I lending at banks has remained robust in the 
intermeeting period, with demand for bank loan s reportedly supported by a few firms that 
pulled or downsized their bond offerings in the aftermath of the General Motors and Ford 
debt downgrades.  Commercial paper outsta nding has also continued to expand.  On 
balance, net borrowing through bank loans, commercial paper, and bonds picked up during April and May compared with its first-quarter pace.  During the intermeeting period, equity issuan ce by nonfinancial firms remained at the 
muted pace recorded in April, but filings w ith the SEC regarding future IPOs stayed 
plentiful amid some postponed offerings.  Equ ity retirements appear  to have accelerated 
this quarter from an already rapid pace, as strong profits and liquid balance sheets 
continued to bolster cash-fina nced M&A deals and share repurchases.  As a result, net 
equity issuance has likely moved further into negative territory.  
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt expanded rapidly in the fi rst quarter, and actual and 
anticipated CMBS issuance suggest a further strong gain in the second quarter.  The 
spreads on AAA-rated CMBS over Treasuries he ld steady over the intermeeting period, 
while those on BBB-rated issues rose somewhat further.  Th e widening of spreads since 
the beginning of this year appears more re lated to abundant supply than to increased 
credit quality concerns.  Delinquency rates on CMBS have continued to recede, and those 
on commercial mortgages held by banks and insurance companies remain quite low. 
 
Household Finance 
Household debt increased at a robust pace in the first quarter, led by a further rapid gain 
in mortgage debt.  Brisk increases in pr ices of existing homes through early spring 
suggest that the growth of mortgage debt is  likely to have stayed  strong in the current 
quarter.  Rates on both fixed-rate and adjust able-rate mortgages remain low, but the 
substantial rise in short-term interest ra tes has shown through to rates on home equity 
lines of credit, damping the growth of bo rrowing under these lines.  Year-over-year

growth of consumer credit through April rema ined near the moderate pace registered 
since early 2003.  The ratio of financial obligations to disposab le income ticked up in the first quarter after 
having been held down in the fourth quarter by the surge of income associated with the 
special dividend payment by Microsoft.  From  a slightly longer-term perspective, the 
financial obligations ratio has edged up, on net,  from its low last summer, as rapid debt 
growth has boosted debt service payments fast er than income.  Bankruptcy filings have 
fallen slightly in recent weeks but remain elev ated, as individuals rush  to file before the 
new bankruptcy law takes effect this fall.  Th e latest data on other measures suggest that 
household credit quality has improved or held  steady—delinquency rates on credit cards, 
auto loans, and residential mortgages have rema ined low or have continued to decline.   
 Large increases in house prices have conti nued to support household wealth, as the ratio 
of net worth to income was about unchanged in  the first quarter desp ite a decline in stock 
prices.  The recent rebound in equity prices suggests that net worth will increase in the 
current quarter.  Compared with April’s rela tively sluggish pace, net flows into long-term 
mutual funds rebounded some in May, reflecti ng a slight increase for domestic equity 
funds and a large rise for bond funds. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury announced at its May mid-quart er refunding that it was considering 
reintroducing the thir ty-year nominal bond in February 2006.  This development 
reportedly took market participants somewhat  by surprise—perhaps especially given the 
recent improvement in the federal budget outlook—and the announcement pushed the yield on the current on-the-r un thirty-year bond, which matu res in 2031, 14 basis points 
higher.  Auctions of nominal Treasury coupon securities that took place during the 
intermeeting period were reasonably well re ceived.  Bid-to-cover ratios were about 
average, and foreign demand, as indicated by investor-class allotments, remained at 
robust levels.  Data from the Treasury Inte rnational Capital Syst em showed that net 
purchases of Treasury securities by foreign offi cial institutions rebounded in April after a 
drop the month before, while purchases by pr ivate foreign investors moderated from a 
record reading in March.           The House Financial Services Committee approv ed legislation that would create a new 
regulator for Fannie Mae and Fr eddie Mac.  The legislation was generally viewed as 
favorable for the GSEs, with only modest chan ges in their regulator y oversight and no

significant changes in their bus iness operations or in their relationship to the federal 
government.  Equity prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac moved up over the 
intermeeting period, and spreads of GSE senior  unsecured debt over comparable Treasury 
securities narrowed.  
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross municipal bond issuance moved up in Ma y and the first half  of June, with 
education-related projects accounting for the bulk of the new-capital issuance.  Advance 
refundings also have been elevated, as states  and municipalities have  continued to take 
advantage of low long-term interest rates.   With regard to cred it quality, Standard and 
Poor’s downgraded a large number of munici pal issues in Michigan, a rating action 
related to the difficulti es of Ford and General Motors.  However, the dollar amount of the 
downgraded debt was small.  Apart from these actions, upgrades of municipal bonds 
continued to outpace downgrades.  Yields on long-term general obligation bonds ticked 
down over the intermeeting period, but by less than comparable Treasuries, perhaps 
reflecting the recent strong pace of issuance.          
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 contracted slightly in Ap ril and May.  The weakness can be  attributed to increases in 
the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets.  M2 velocity—the ratio of nominal GDP to 
M2—is somewhat lower than would be expected  on the basis of its hi storical relationship 
with opportunity cost, perhaps in part because the lower level of long- term interest rates 
does not offer much inducement to move out of M2 assets.    Within M2, small time deposits continued to  expand briskly during April and May, while 
liquid deposits ran off.  The divergent trends re flect in part the more rapid adjustment of 
rates paid on small time deposits to rising sh ort-term market yields than rates paid on 
liquid assets.  Currency growth continued to be weak relativ e to historical trends.   
 Bank credit decelerated sharply in April and May from the rapi d gains posted in the first 
quarter as both securities and loan growth fe ll.  Consumer loans ran off, and the growth 
of real estate loans weakened considerably, in part because of securitizations.  Business 
lending remained strong, and results from the most recent Survey of Terms of Business 
Lending, conducted during the week of May 2, indicate that spreads of rates on C&I 
loans over banks’ estimated funding costs ha d edged a bit lower since the February 
survey.  Meanwhile, spreads on leveraged s yndicated loans moved somewhat higher in 
May but remained at fairly low levels.

In April, the value of exports of goods and services increased a r obust 3 percent, after 
increasing 1.6 percent in March.  In both months the increase in exports was widely 
dispersed across major product categories.  E xports of capital goods were particularly 
strong in both April and March, led by robus t exports of aircraft.  Exports of both 
computers and semiconductors also turned up noticeably in April, following slight 
increases in March.  After declining in March, exports of industrial supplies jumped up in 
April.  Exports of consumer goods declined in  both months, while exports of automotive 
products declined a bit in March before moving up in April.   Services exports were about 
flat in April after increasing strongly in March.  Accounti ng for March data exports of 
goods and services in the first quarter cl imbed over 12 percent at an annual rate. 
 The value of imported goods and services jumped  just over 4 percent in  April, more than 
offsetting a 3 percent decline in  March.  In April, imports of capital goods and industrial 
supplies snapped back sharply after falling in March, while imports of consumer goods 
and automotive products reversed some, but not  all, of their steep March declines.  
Imports of petroleum, aircraft, and se rvices all increased in both months.  
Notwithstanding the March declin e, in the first quarter, im ports of goods and services 
rose 10 percent at an annual rate, with incr eases in imports of non-oil goods and services 
more than offsetting a decrease in the value of oil imports.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In May, the prices of U.S. impo rts of non-oil goods and of core goods 
both fell 0.3 percent.  The main contributi on to the price decline came from non-oil 
industrial supplies.  After increasing 2.1 per cent in April, the pr ice index for non-oil 
industrial supplies fell 1.5 pe rcent in May, mainly on lower prices for natural gas and 
building materials.  Food prices rose 0.3 percent in May, which partially offset the 
previous month’s 0.4 percent dec line.  After large price incr eases earlier in the year, the 
finished goods categories had only small pr ice movements in May.  Prices for both 
consumer goods and capital goods (excludi ng computers and semiconductors) edged up 
0.1 percent.  (Within consumer goods, appare l prices fell 0.2 percent.)  Prices for 
imported automotive products fell 0.1 percent.  Prices for computer s declined 0.3 percent 
in May, and prices for semiconductors were unchanged.    The average level of imported core goods pric es in April and May was 2½ percent at an 
annual rate above the first-quarter level.  The main contributors to the overall price 
increase were foods and non-oil industrial supplies, with both categories having price 
increases of over 8 percent (a.r.).  In Apr il and May, the average price for capital goods 
(excluding computers and semiconductors) incr eased 2¾ percent (a.r.) compared to the 
previous quarter, a much slow er rate of increase than obser ved in the first quarter, and 
prices for consumer goods increased only slightly.   
 Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil fell 6.5 perc ent in May.  Similarl y, the spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell  6 percent in May—averaging around $50 per 
barrel.  The spot price fell in  the middle of the month as crude oil inventories in the 
United States climbed to above-average leve ls, but edged back up on renewed concerns 
of strong world oil demand and limited spare pr oduction capacity.  Thus far in June, the 
spot price has averaged more than $55 per barrel, closing at $58.90 per barrel on June 21.  
The increase in the spot price in June reflects continued strong world oil demand, 
amplified concerns about future supplies from  Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia, 
and limited spare production capacity in OPEC  to offset a significant supply disruption. 
 Exports.   In May, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods both fell 
0.1 percent.  A 2 percent increa se in prices for agricultural products only partially offset 
the 1.1 percent fall in prices of non-agricultural i ndustrial supplies.  Prices for the 
finished goods categories were little cha nged.  Exported automotive products saw the 
largest price increase at 0.1 percent.  Prices of exporte d computers and semiconductors 
declined slightly.

The average level of exported core goods pr ices in April and May was 5 percent at an 
annual rate above the first-quarter level.  During these months, prices for agricultural 
products and non-agricultural i ndustrial supplies were up ove r 15 percent and 9 percent, 
respectively.  Prices for capital goods (e xcluding computers and semiconductors) and 
consumer goods were both up about 1½ percent.   
Current Account  
The U.S. current account deficit was $780 billi on (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter of 2005, up 
from $753 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 (revised).  Most  of the change owed to an 
increase in unilateral transfers, but a wide r trade deficit on goods and services also 
contributed.  The positive ba lance on net investment in come increased slightly. 
  The negative balance on unila teral transfers widened $19 bi llion (became more negative) 
in the first quarter, mostly as a result of larger governme nt grants.  The deficit on goods 
and services widened $10 billion, as a $45 bil lion increase in imports was only partially 
offset by a $35 billion increase in exports.  A la rger deficit in goods was partly offset by a 
larger surplus on services.  Th e surplus on net investment income rose $2 billion in the 
first quarter, as payments declined a bit mo re than receipts.  For both payments and 
receipts, a large decline in the direct investment compone nt was almost offset by a 
similarly large increase in  interest and dividends.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities remained very strong in the first quarter of 
2005 but weakened in April (line 4 of the Su mmary of U.S. Intern ational Transactions 
table).  Most of the slowdown in private in flows from March to April reflects notably 
weaker net purchases of Treasury securities  (line 4a), which dropped back from their 
record monthly high in March.  A swing from  net purchases to net sales by Caribbean 
banking centers more than accounted for this decline.  Private purchases of corporate 
equities (line 4d) were relati vely strong at the beginning of the year, but have been weak 
for the past three months, and private forei gn investors sold agen cy bonds (line 4b) for 
the third consecutive month.  Private inflows in to corporate bonds (line 4c) eased a bit in 
April from the very strong inflows recorded  in recent months; on balance, average net 
purchases of corporate bonds this year ha ve been just a bit weaker than in 2004.  
 Net foreign official flows (lin e 1) picked up from weak inflows in February and March to 
$39 billion in April, the largest monthly o fficial inflow since June 2004.  Activity by 
Norway, which actively manages its oil f und, has accounted for much of the recent 
monthly swings in official flows.  Inflow s from most Asian countries have been well 
below those of the second half of last year , and for the first four months of 2005, foreign 
official inflows have amounted to $65 billion, well below the pace of th e past two years.  
However, inflows from China have remained re latively strong so far this year.  Partial 
data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for May and the first half of June 
indicate sizable official infl ows, primarily reflecting furthe r increases in holdings for 
China.     U.S. investors acquired on net $8 billion in fore ign securities in Apr il (line 5), bringing 
total acquisitions of foreign securities this year to $47 billion, comp ared with $32 billion 
for the first four months of 2004.  U.S. purch ases of foreign bonds (line 5a) edged up in 
April, but purchases of stocks  (line 5b) were notably weak er than in recent months, 
consistent with a recent slowdown in  inflows to global mutual funds. 
 The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a large net outflow in April, in large part 
reflecting repurchase activity concentrated in Caribbean banking centers.  For the year to 
date, the banking sector has recorded a net outflow of $66 billion.   
Since the last Greenbook, we have received pre liminary Balance of Payments data for the 
first quarter.  Direct investment flows were r oughly offsetting in the quarter.  U.S. direct 
IV-8 
investment abroad (line 6) returned to a more normal outflow of $32 billion, reflecting a 
moderate pace of new equity investment and reinvested earnings.  This followed a surge in the fourth quarter that was influenced by both the re-incorporation in the United States 
of News Corporation Ltd. (Aus tralia) and anticipati on of the partial tax holiday.  Inflows 
from foreign direct investment in the United St ates (line 7) continued at their recent trend 
rate.    With the first quarter Balance of Payments release, BEA also provided annual revisions 
to its estimates of financial transactions.  BEA revised upward its estimates of foreign 
official inflows in 2003 and 2004 to account fo r increased official holdings of Treasury 
and agency bonds as identified in the June 2003 and June 2004 surveys of foreign holdings of U.S. securities.  These revisions increased estimated foreign official inflows 
by roughly $30 billion in each year.  There were roughly offsetting downward revisions 
to private inflows.  BEA also made signifi cant revisions to its estimates of U.S. net 
acquisitions of foreign securities in 2 002 and 2003.  The new estimates incorporate 
results from the December 2003 survey of U.S.  holdings of foreign securities, which 
measured higher than expected holdings esp ecially of foreign bonds.  BEA now estimates 
that for 2002 and 2003 combined, U.S. invest ors purchased on net $73 billion in foreign 
bonds over the two-year period.  This compares  with the previous estimate of $49 billion 
in net sales—a revision of $122 billion.      The revised international tran sactions accounts continue to  show negative statistical 
discrepancies in 2002 and 2003, indicating th at net financial inflows exceeded the 
reported current account deficit.  Howeve r, in the new estimates the combined 
discrepancy for the two years is smaller.  For 2004, the statistical discrepancy was 
increased to a positive $85 bill ion.  The statistical discrepancy in the first quarter of 2005 
was a positive $34 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The trade-weighted index of the nominal exch ange value of the dollar against the major 
currencies has risen 3 percent on net sin ce the May FOMC mee ting, with the dollar 
appreciating sharply against most major foreign currencie s.  The dollar appreciated 
6½ percent against the euro, with much of  the movement occurring after the clear 
rejections of the European Union’s constitution by French and Dutch voters.  Several weaker-than-expected economic data releases  in the euro area and comments by some 
ECB officials that appeared to signal a willingness to consider  an interest rate cut also 
weighed on the euro.  The dollar appreciated about 3½ against sterling and the yen amid 
some weaker-than-expected economic data rele ases in the United Kingdom and Japan.  In 
contrast, the dollar depreciated 1½ percent against the Canadian dollar, which was 
supported by stronger-than-expected Cana dian economic data releases, including 
employment and trade data.  Mark et participants also interpreted the increase in Canadian 
government’s fiscal spending plans as o ffering further support to economic growth. 
                  Recent differences in economic performan ce between the United States and several 
European countries were reflected  in developments in short-term interest rates.  Whereas 
U.S. dollar three-month deposit rates rose 25 basis points over the intermeeting period, 
comparable euro and sterling interest rates declined slightly.  As had been widely

expected, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the Bank of England, and 
the Bank of Canada all left their respective monetary polic y stances unchanged during the 
intermeeting period.  Although the BOJ did not cha nge its official monetary stance at its 
meeting on May 20, it stated that it may allow banks’ current accounts held at the BOJ to fall below its target range of ¥30 to ¥35 trilli on in cases of exceptionally weak liquidity 
demand.  At the June 8-9 meeting of the Ba nk of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, 
two members voted for a rate cut.  Yields  on ten-year government  bonds declined 20 to 
25 basis points in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Despite 
strong economic growth in Canada, the yiel d on the ten-year Canadian government bond 
declined 35 basis points.                       Equity price indexes in major industrial countries rose 3½ to 8 percent over the 
intermeeting period, in part on declines in nomin al interest rates and as well as on several 
positive earnings announcements from firms in Europe and the United States.  Share prices in the euro area were also likely supported by the decline in the real effective 
exchange value of the euro.

The dollar was little changed on balance on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of our other important trading partners.  Speculation about how and when China may 
abandon the renminbi’s peg to the dollar conti nued to be a focus of market participants’ 
discussions.  The expected rates of apprecia tion of the renminbi (RMB) against the dollar 
three- and twelve-months ahead remained at  relatively elevated levels over the 
intermeeting period, at 1½ and 5 percent, respectively.  On May 18, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System began to include eight additional non-RMB foreign currency pairs.  Market participants viewed this st ep as a precursor to moving toward a more 
flexible Chinese exchange rate regime.  Also on that day, the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority announced a new trading band of 7.75-7.85 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, 
IV-13 
imposing a limit to appreciation of the currency  for the first time in many years.  (The 
Hong Kong dollar’s peg was, before then, one-sided: the Hong K ong dollar was allowed 
to appreciate relative to the stated peg, but not to deprecia te.)  Market participants 
reported that the move was likely designed to reduce expectations that Hong Kong’s 
currency board arrangement woul d be affected by any future change in China’s exchange 
rate regime.   
 
The Brazilian real appreciated about 6 percent on balance against the dollar, and Brazil’s 
EMBI+ spread over Treasuries declined about 50 basis points.  The central bank of Brazil 
raised the policy rate another 25 basis points in May, to 19.75 per cent, but in June it left 
the policy rate unchanged in response to signs of falling inflation and weakening 
economic activity. Brazilian financial indicators  rose early in the intermeeting period, but 
declined somewhat in late May and early Ju ne following reports of corruption allegations 
regarding members of the Lula administration.  Financial indicators rebounded in 
mid-June as concerns about the corru ption allegations were alleviated.

the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
GDP growth in most major foreign industrial economies picked up slightly in the first quarter.  Both Germany and Japan posted uncha racteristically large increases; real GDP 
grew 4.2 and 4.9 percent, respectively.  In the United Kingdom and France, however, 
growth slowed, while the Ita lian economy contracted for th e second consecutive quarter.  
Recent economic indicators for the major fore ign economies in the second quarter have 
been mixed.  Indicators for Japan and Canada  have been strong, while indicators for the 
United Kingdom and the euro area have been weak.   Consumer price inflation remained subdued overa ll, despite recent incr eases in oil prices. 
In the euro area, 12-month inflation edged down to 1.9 percent in April.  In Canada, 
consumer prices continued risi ng at moderate rates.  Even though the inflation rate in the 
United Kingdom moved up earlier in the year, it continued to be slightly below the Bank 
of England’s 2-percent target.  M ild deflation persisted in Japan. 
 In Japan , first-quarter growth jumped markedly to  4.9 percent at an a nnual rate.  Private 
consumption grew 4.6 percent, fueled in pa rt by a further decline in household saving 
rates.  Private investment rose 7.1 percent after minimal growth in the previous two 
quarters.  Although high-tech i nventories continued to declin e gradually, stocks in other 
sectors have risen over the last two quarters, and overall inventory in vestment contributed 
1.1 percentage points to GDP gr owth. Net exports continued to  make a slight negative 
contribution to growth.  Indicators of second-quarter act ivity have so far been positiv e. After falling in February 
and March, industrial production rose 1.9 percen t in April.  Real spending by households 
rose 1 percent on the month in April, matche d by a similar rise in retail sales, and 
consumer sentiment rose in May to its highe st level in nearly a year.  Labor markets 
continued to improve gradually.  In April, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent, 
marking its lowest level since late 1998.  Th e job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading 
indicator of employment, rose to 0.94, matchi ng highs not seen in twelve years.  The 
external sector continued to make negative contributions:  Real exports of goods rose 0.4 
percent in April while real impor ts of goods rose 1.1 percent.

Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo ar ea (which exclude fresh food but include 
energy) rose one tenth of a percentage point  in May from the previous month and were 
down 0.4 percent from a year earlier.  Wholesale price inflation ticked down to 1.8 
percent in May.  While continuing to state th at it would maintain its policy of quantitative 
easing until deflation ends, the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) Policy Board in late May decided to allow temporary breaks below the target range for banks’ balances with the BOJ if 
banks’ demand for funds was too weak to satis fy the target.  The balance of reserve 
accounts fell below the ¥30 trillion lower end of the target range in early June but 
reversed these declines subsequently.

GDP growth in the  euro area  picked up in the first quarter to a 2 percent pace.  Net 
exports rebounded sharply to co ntribute 2.2 percentage points to GDP, as imports fell and 
exports firmed.  Domestic demand made a sl ight negative contribu tion to growth, as 
contractions in investment and government spen ding more than offset a moderate rise in 
household consumption.  Among individual coun tries, Italian GDP contracted for the 
second straight quarter.  In c ontrast, German GDP growth rose to more than a 4 percent 
pace, but that gain was exaggerated by in adequate adjustment for working days. 
 Indicators for the second qua rter generally have poin ted to economic weakness, 
especially in the industrial sector.  The European Commission’s measure of euro-area 
economic sentiment fell in May to its lowest le vel in more than a year and a half.  The 
euro-area manufacturing PMI declined in Ma y to 48.7, its lowest le vel in nearly two 
years and below the 50 threshold for growth.  In  contrast, the PMI for the services sector 
picked up a bit in May and has fluctuated  around 53 during the past nine months, 
indicating positive growth.  The continued buoyancy of the consumer sector has been 
called into question by a decline in consumer  confidence and the 1.2 percent decline in 
euro-area retail sales in April.

Labor markets conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 8.9 percent in April.  In Germany, the national definition of the unemployment rate was 11.8 percent in May, down a bit from 12 percent in March. 
 Euro-area twelve-month consumer price inflati on inched down to 1.9 percent in May, just 
below the ECB ceiling, from 2.1 percent in Apri l.  Core inflation, excluding energy and 
unprocessed food, was up a bit to 1.5 percen t but remained below the first quarter-
average.  In April and May, on average, en ergy prices were up more than 1½ percent 
from March.  French and Dutch voters reject ed the EU constitu tional treaty in recent referendums.  
Nearly 55 percent of French voters voted “no” on May 29, and n early 62 percent of 
Dutch voters followed suit on June 1.  The future  of this treaty is now very uncertain.  
Nine countries, accounting for nearly half of  the EU population, have already ratified the 
constitutional treaty, although only one – Sp ain – did so by referendum.  Several EU 
countries, including the United Ki ngdom, have put plans for c onstitutional referendums

economic effect of the rejections.  In the medium term, however, the rejection of the 
Constitution could make it more difficult for member states to agree on EU affairs and hinder structural reforms that the EU Co mmission has promoted in recent years. 
 Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 2 percent at an annua l rate in the first quarter, 
slightly lower than the preliminary estimat e.  Total domestic demand growth slowed 
sharply in the first quarter to a paltry 0.6 percent rate.  Consumption growth improved 
over the fourth quarter but remained quite w eak.  Investment surprised on the downside, 
actually contracting 0.1 percent.   Imports fell more than exports, leading to a large 
positive contribution from net exports.  House prices were essentially unchanged in April and May, marking a slowdown from the first quar ter.  Consistent with the deceleration in 
house prices, household net mortgage borrowing weakened somewhat in April, staying 
well below its 2003 peak.  Business confidence has fallen considerably sinc e the end of the first quarter.  Consumer 
confidence, after increasing at the end of the first quarter, fell back below its long-run 
average in April and May.  The PMI for manufacturing fell below 50 in April and 
dropped further in May, signaling a possible c ontraction in manufacturing.  The PMI for

In Canada, real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the first quarter , a slight acceleration from the 
previous quarter.  The sharp divergence between net external demand, which made a 
negative contribution to GDP growth and domestic demand, which expanded strongly, 
continued for the third quarter in a row.  Following two quarters of declines, exports 
rebounded to post a 5.9 percent advance.  Howe ver, a much larger surge in imports 
caused net exports to subtract  1.7 percentage points from growth.  Personal consumption 
and business investment, especially of mach inery and equipment, continued their strong 
growth. 
 
Indicators for the second quart er suggest further strengtheni ng of economic activity.  The 
merchandise trade surplus ticked up in April as  exports rose and im ports fell slightly.  
Housing starts dipped a bit in May, but sti ll remain solid.  Manufacturing shipments and 
new orders each perked up in April following a weak finish in the first quarter.  Retail 
sales surged in April, continuing their first- quarter strength.  In May, the composite index 
of leading indicators continue d its recent solid  advances.  
 
IV-21 
Employment growth was quite strong in both April and May, with the notable exception 
of the manufacturing sector, which continue s to shed jobs.  The unemployment rate 
continued to edge down in the first two mont hs of the second quarter, reaching a five-
year low of 6.8 percent.  In April, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation edged up to 2.4 percent, while 
the twelve-month rate of core inflati on, which excludes the eight most volatile 
components from the overall price index, moved down slightly to 1.7 percent.  In May, as part of a deal to help keep th e minority Liberal government in place, the 
government announced roughly C$10 billion of additional spending in 2005 and 2006.  The new spending is targeted mostly for health care and other social programs.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Indicators have varied across the devel oping economies but, on balance, point to 
moderation in economic performance.  In Asia, some ASEAN c ountries are showing 
signs of a sharp pickup from a weak first qua rter, while performance has disappointed in 
Korea and recent data suggest some slowing in China’s extraordinary pace of growth.  
For the major Latin American economies, tight er monetary policy ha s contributed to a 
step-down in growth.  With the notable except ion of China and Mexico, inflation rates in 
most of the emerging economies have held st eady or risen from their levels last year. 
 Indicators from China  point to strong growth, albeit o ff the blistering pace of the first 
quarter.  The trade balance has widened signifi cantly in recent months; exports continued 
to grow rapidly while imports slowed consid erably.  The weakness in imports has been 
widespread across categories and is likely due to the effects of last year’s measures to 
rein in investment growth as well as to the increased domestic production of certain 
imported goods.  Imports of steel, for example,  have slowed as domestic steel production 
has soared in response to significant investment in st eel manufacturing capacity.  
Industrial production was flat in May after surg ing in April.  Investment growth remains 
robust, though below its first-quarter pace, a nd the Chinese PMI fell in May but stayed in 
expansionary territory.  Consum er price inflation remained lo w, as declining food prices 
have offset modest increases in non-food prices.

Taiwanese  real GDP grew just over 2½ percent (a.r .) in the first quarter.  Export growth 
was strong enough to offset a large negative cont ribution from the change in inventories.  
Industrial production rose in Ap ril after contracting, on averag e, in each of the last two 
quarters.  Orders for electronic goods rebounded in April following a weak first quarter.  
Consumer price inflation was up from the first quarter, largely due to increases in food 
prices.

Data for Korea  have generally weakened.  Real GDP  rose only 1.4 percent (a.r.) in the 
first quarter.  Output was boos ted by consumption and a notab le increase in net exports 
but held down by a sharp inventory runoff a nd a drop in investment.  Indicators for the 
second quarter are mixed.  Recent sales a nd confidence surveys were up from first-
quarter levels but industrial production fell in  April and the current account registered a 
deficit as export growth moderated and forei gners received sizable investment income.  
Consumer price inflation remained with in the government’s target range of 
2.5-3.5 percent and the unemployment rate was basically unchanged.

In the ASEAN  region, first-quarter performance was mixed.  Real GDP growth increased 
in Malaysia and the Philippines, moderated in  Indonesia, and turned  negative in Thailand 
and Singapore.  Domestic factors, including a recovery in the Philippine agriculture 
sector and the effects of the tsunami in  Thailand, contributed to the divergent 
performance.  More recently, for a number  of countries, April industrial production was 
up from the first-quarter average.   The ASEAN economies continued, on average, to  run trade surpluses.  The exception is 
Thailand where the effect of higher oil prices on imports ha s contributed to large trade 
deficits so far this year.  Aside from Singapore, consumer price inflat ion remained elevated across the region, 
reflecting higher food and energy prices and the eff ect of reductions in oil subsidies in 
some countries.  The Thai central bank con tinued tightening moneta ry policy by raising 
interest rates 25 basis points to 2.50 percent on Ju ne 9, the fifth rate increase since August 
2004.

Recent indicators for India  have been generally positive.  Industrial production surged in 
March before pausing in April.  Although c onsumer price inflation has risen recently, 
growth in the more-watched wholesale price index remains well below the fourth-quarter 
pace.  Export growth is up but has been outpaced by surging imports, and the current 
account deficit has expanded.  The Reserve Bank  of India surprised market participants 
by increasing a key target rate 25 basis point s at its late April me eting, citing concerns 
over higher oil and other commodity prices.

In Mexico , recent data suggest a moderation in ec onomic activity.  First-quarter real GDP 
grew 1.7 percent at an annual ra te, down from 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting 
weaker U.S. demand for Mexican manufacturing exports and higher Mexican real interest 
rates.  Fewer working days in the first quart er–as the Easter holidays fell in March this 
year compared with April in 2004–also contributed to the soft economic performance.  Production remained sluggish in April.  After tightening monetary policy a dozen times from early 2004 to March 2005, the Bank of Mexico has left its monetary stance unchange d so far in the second quarter.  The rate 
on 28-day peso-denominated bills is now a bout 9.6 percent, up from about 5 percent 
when tightening began.  Twelve-month consum er prices rose 4.6 percent in May, below 
the 5.3 percent registered at the end of last y ear, but still above the target range of 2 to 
4 percent.  Core inflation (not shown) has been trending down, however.

In Brazil , data releases since the April Greenboo k have pointed to continued weakening 
in economic activity.  Real GDP growth was up only 1.3 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, 
with private consumption d eclining over 2 percent and investment dropping for the 
second consecutive quarter.  The export sector  was the only bright spot.  In April, 
industrial production held steady, but output of  capital goods decline d.  Both headline 
inflation and core inflation (e xcluding food and administered  prices) slowed in May, and 
the median expected inflation for twelve m onths ahead declined to about 5 percent. 
 After a surprise 25 basis point rate hike in  May, the Brazilian central bank has left its 
policy rate, the Selic, unchanged at 19¾ pe rcent in response to the weaker economy.  
Scandals involving members of Lula’s political  coalition have dominated the headlines in 
recent weeks.  Although Lula has not been impl icated, the crisis is eroding his previously 
high level of popular support and raising so me concerns about the future of the 
government’s reform efforts.

The economic recovery in Argentina  appears to be maturing.  Real GDP rose at an 
annual rate of just 2 percent in  the first quarter as constructi on in part took a respite from 
the heady pace of expansion of  late last year.  The unemp loyment rate moved up in the 
first quarter after having fallen re latively steadily to about half  of its crisis peak.  More 
recently, industrial production ticked down in  April following previous strong gains.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation was 8½ percent in May as a result of a jump in 
food prices earlier in the y ear.  Inflation remains above the upper end of the central 
bank’s unofficial target range of 5-8 percent for 2005.  The final settlement of Argentina’s debt ex change was completed in early June.  On 
June 1, Standard & Poor’s changed Argentin a’s long-term soverei gn credit rating from 
selective default to B-.  Argentina’s access to  international capital markets may partially 
depend on the fate of Argentina’s hold-out investors, accounting for almost $20 billion 
(about 25 percent) in defaulted bonds, and on the outcome of upcomi ng negotiations with 
the IMF over a new loan program.

In Venezuela , preliminary estimates point to strong real GDP growth in the first quarter, 
supported by oil revenue-financed government  spending.  Inflation has continued to be 
high, with the monthly CPI rising 2.6 percen t in May, driven by pass-through from the 
March devaluation of the bolivar as well as by expansionary fiscal policies.  International 
reserves edged up to $28 billion in mid-June.  Oil production is widely believed to have 
declined in recent months, reflecting numer ous problems at the government oil firm and 
the government’s continued hostili ty toward private investors.
