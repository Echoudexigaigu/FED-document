Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Overview  
Led by strong growth in final sales, economic  activity expanded at  a solid pace in the 
second quarter.  In particular, net exports surged and residential investment posted 
another robust gain.  Consumer spending and business investment rose at moderate rates 
last quarter.  However, ma nufacturing output decelerated a good bit, and the pace of 
inventory investment dropped cons iderably.  In the past few months, the labor market has 
continued to improve gradually.  On average,  payrolls have expande d a bit more rapidly 
than we estimate is necessary to absorb ne t new entrants into the workforce, and the 
unemployment rate has edged down to 5 perc ent.  Meanwhile, core consumer price 
inflation has moderated in recent months. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
The labor market continues to make steady pr ogress:  Private payroll employment rose 
144,000 in June, bringing the average gain for the first half of th e year to 172,000 jobs 
per month, roughly on par with the average m onthly increase last year.  Hiring in the 
services industries and in construction remained strong in June, but manufacturing employment declined further.  Aggregate hour s of production workers rose at an annual 
rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter, a b it faster than in the first quarter.  More 
recently, the four-week moving average of init ial claims for unemployment insurance has 
fallen to 317,000 in the week ending July 30, noticeably below the mid-June readings. 
 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in 
June, to 5.0 percent, and the labor force part icipation rate dropped back 0.1 percentage 
point, to 66.0 percent.  The unemployment rate  currently stands about where it was in 
mid-1997, when we judge the labor market to ha ve been roughly in equilibrium.  Several 
other indicators are also appr oximately in line with their 1997 average levels.  The share 
of persons working part-time for economic reasons, the short-te rm quit rate—which 
provides a measure of workers’ perceptions  of the relative abunda nce of alternative 
employment—new hiring plans (as measured by the Manpower survey), and the rate of 
insured unemployment have all moved back to the favorable levels of  eight years ago.   
 
However, other indicators of labor market conditions are a bit w eaker than their 1997 
levels.  According to the National Federa tion of Independent Business survey, the 
fraction of firms with a position described as  hard-to-fill remains visibly below where it 
was eight years ago, an indication that sma ller firms face few shortages of workers.  
Households’ perceptions of job availability are also below the average level in 1997.  In 
addition, many job seekers continue to experien ce long periods of job search.  Despite

dropping lately, long-term unemployment is still high, and the exhaustion rate—the 
proportion of workers leaving the unemployme nt insurance (UI) rolls after having used 
their entire period of eligibil ity (usually twenty-six weeks)—remains somewhat elevated.  
Finally, the number of mont hly layoff announcements, which should move down as labor 
market conditions improve, has not yet reached  the low levels of the mid-1990s.  On 
balance, these indicators suggest that the unemployment rate may be understating, if only 
a little, the amount of slack that  remains in the labor market. 
 
Based on the latest National Income and Produc t Accounts (NIPA) data, we now estimate 
that productivity in the nonfarm business sector  increased at an annua l rate of 3¼ percent 
in the first quarter and 2 per cent in the second quarter.  Ov er the four quarters ending in 
the second quarter of 2005, productivity rose an  estimated 2¼ percent, a considerable 
step-down from the comparable pe riod four quarters earlier.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production climbed 0.9 percent in June, led by a weather-related jump of 
5.3 percent in the output of utilities.  Manuf acturing production advanced at a solid pace 
in both May and June.  However, these gains followed small declines in the preceding 
two months.  As a result, factory production rose at an annual rate of only 1½ percent in 
the second quarter, partly reflecting a slow ing pace of inventory investment.  Still, 
indicators for July suggest that the improved pace of activity in the late spring continued 
last month.

The second-quarter deceleration in manufact uring production was due , in part, to a 
contraction in motor vehicle output, as both medium and heavy truck assemblies and light 
vehicle production moved lower.  Light vehicl e assemblies fell to an annual rate of  
11.1 million units in April and May—well belo w their first-quarter pace—as producers 
worked off elevated light truck inventories.   In June, assemblies rebounded to a rate of 
11.7 million units, and they are estimated to have remained at that rate in July.  For the 
third quarter as a whole, manu facturers’ schedules call for light vehicle production at an 
annual rate of 11.8 million units.

In the high-tech sector, the pace of production growth has been only lukewarm of late.  In 
June, the output of high-technology products ed ged up 0.2 percent, the smallest increase 
since December 2003 and well below the l onger-run (1972–2004) average monthly gain 
of 1.6 percent (not at an annua l rate).  For the second quarter as a whole, the output of 
communications equipment posted a moderate increase, and computer production rose at 
an annual rate of 15 percent—a relatively modest gain by the standards of that sector but 
well above the meager 2004 increase.  Noneth eless, anecdotal evidence on high-tech 
production has been positive.  Recent industr y reports point to strengthening business 
demand for communications equipment, which bodes well for domestic production 
because U.S. manufacturers specia lize more in products geared toward business use.  In

networking equipment and computer  hardware popped up in July. 
 
Upstream from computers and communications equipment, the production of 
semiconductors has been sluggish.  Output in creased just 0.8 percen t in June, capping a 
sharp deceleration for the second quarter as a whole.  Going forward, Intel’s third-quarter 
guidance is consistent with accelerati ng production of micropr ocessors and flash 
memory, which make up almost one-fourth  of industry semiconductor production.  
Moreover, the increased usage of the latest  generation of semiconductor chips (such as 
dual-core microprocessors) may boost production in coming months.1   
 
Elsewhere, industrial production showed mixe d results in the sec ond quarter.  The index 
for business equipment rose at a annual rate of 9.7 percent, and the index for defense and 
space equipment shot up at a rate of nearly 17 percent.  In contrast, the output of consumer goods slowed to a 1.7 percent gai n, and the output of bus iness and construction 
supplies rose more modestly than in the fi rst quarter.  Materials output, which accounts 
for about one-fourth of total industrial pr oduction, declined at an annual rate of 
3.3 percent in the second quarter; drops in the production of paper and steel—industries 
in which inventories remain elevated rela tive to consumption—more than accounted for 
the decline.   
 
The available weekly output data suggest une ven production growth in July.  Total motor 
vehicle assemblies edged up, electricity generation increased a littl e further after an 
enormous rise in June, and lumber production appears to have rebounded from its drop in 
June.  However, the output of crude oil was held down by the recent hurricane activity in 
the Gulf of Mexico.  Among the forward-look ing indicators, the staff’s series on real 
adjusted durable goods orders rose marked ly in June, and the Institute for Supply 
Management’s new orders diffusion index m oved higher in July.  The regional indexes 
such as the Empire State Survey and th e Philadelphia Business Outlook Survey also 
improved in July.  Taken together, these series are consistent with solid near-term gains in manufacturing output.

Motor Vehicles  
After dipping in the first quarter, sales of light vehicles rebounded in the second quarter 
to an annual rate of 17.2 million units.  In Jul y, sales of light vehicles surged further to 
20.6 million units.  The jump in July sales re flected the extension of General Motors’ 
(GM) employee-discount program and the intr oduction of similar programs by Ford and 
Chrysler.2  These programs have proven to be immensely popular even though the Big 
Three automakers seem to have offset some  of the cost of the new programs by cutting 
back on incentives that traditionall y have been used to fuel sales. 3  Industry contacts 
suggest that customers may be responding positively to the programs’ fixed, “no haggle” 
pricing.  According to the Michigan Survey, the July  sales increase—which was 
concentrated in light trucks—may also have benefited to some extent from diminished concerns about gasoline pri ces.  Overall, the Michigan index of car-buying conditions 
jumped in July to its most favor able level since last December. 
 
Reflecting the elevated pace of sales, inventor ies of light vehicles fell in June and are 
estimated to have declined again in July  to their lowest level since early 2002.4  
Inventories appear to be part icularly lean at GM, which reported that—excluding periods 
affected by strikes—its stock of light vehicles may be at  the lowest level since 1975. 
 
Consumer Spending  
After having posted sizable gain s in the second half of last year, real consumer spending 
expanded at a more moderate pace in the firs t half of this year.  Excluding the wide 
swings in motor vehicles purchases, consumer ou tlays rose at an annual rate of more than 
4 percent in the first quarter before deceler ating to a 3 percent pace in the second. The 
moderation was consistent with the temper ate fundamentals underlying consumption in 
the first half.  More recentl y, both stock prices and consum er confidence have moved up 
from their levels earlier this year. 
                                                 
2 In early June, GM introduced its employee-disc ount program, which allowed the general public to 
purchase vehicles at the same prices as those offered to GM employees.  Chrysler and Ford followed with 
similar programs in July.  GM and Chrysler consumer s can also take advantage of cash rebates or reduced-
rate financing.  In the Ford program, the employee-discount price is in lieu of cash rebates or reduced-rate 
financing.  In June and July all three promotions covered most 2005 model-year vehicles.  GM and Ford 
have extended their programs through September 6.  Chrysler has reported plans to continue its program until its stock of 2005 model-year vehicles is exhausted. 
3 J.D. Power and Associates reports that the value of  incentives fell sharply in June and again in July.  
The employee price programs represent a price cut an d are not captured in these incentive series, which 
include only cash rebates and reduced-rate financing.  
4 Estimates of light vehicle inventories in July are based on actual reported sales and estimated light 
vehicle production from Ward’s Communications.

The monthly pattern of consumer spending was uneven in the sec ond quarter.  After 
increasing solidly in April, total real pe rsonal consumption expe nditures edged down in 
May and then jumped 1.1 percent in June.5   Sales of cars and truc ks rose sharply in June, 
and outlays for a broad range of other goods  also surged, putting spending on a strong 
trajectory going into the current quarter.  Expenditures on services expanded at a solid 
pace again in June as unseasonably warm  weather boosted electricity usage.   
 
Going forward, the most recent indicators suggest that spending in July rose at a good clip.  Purchases of motor vehicles climbed to a dizzying pace, and sales at the largest 
chain stores are reported to ha ve been brisk.  In addition, th e July readings of consumer 
sentiment from both the Michigan Survey a nd the Conference Board remained at levels 
consistent with healthy spending gains. 
 
Real disposable personal income rose 0.5 per cent in June but moved up at an annual rate 
of just 1.4 percent for the second quarter as a whole.  Although nominal wages and 
salaries posted a moderate rise last quarter, real income was held back by the jump in 
energy prices.  With increases in spending out pacing gains in dispos able personal income 
in recent months, the personal saving rate is es timated to have fallen to close to zero last 
quarter.  Household wealth appears to have increased roughly in line with income in the 
first half of the year , leaving the wealth-to-income ra tio nearly unchanged.  Movements 
in stock prices since June should have a mo re favorable effect on consumer demand.   
 
Housing  
Activity in the residential construction sect or has remained quite  robust.  New single-
family homes were started at an annual rate  of 1.67 million units in June, well above last 
year’s pace and only a little below the average ra te over the first half of this year.  After 
having dipped in May, starts of multifam ily units rebounded to an annual rate of 
337,000 units in June.  The permits data fo r both sectors sugges t that residential 
construction will remain solid in the near  term.  Permit issuance for single-family 
homes—after adjusting for activity in ar eas where they are not required—rose to 
1.68 million units in June.  Moreover, the backlog of unused permits for single-family units increased substantially.   
                                                 
5 The BEA estimates that real PCE rose 0.8 percen t in June.  Because registration data are not yet 
available, this estimate includes the BEA’s assumption about the share of motor vehicles sold to consumers 
rather than to businesses.  Based on our discussions with automakers, we believe this assumption is too low 
and does not adequately reflect the popularity of GM’s employee-discount program with consumers.  The 
alternative assumption that we have used boosts PCE growth in the second quarter but has an offsetting 
effect on the growth rate of business investment.

Home sales remained strong in June.  Sales of single-family existing homes rose 
2½ percent in June to an annual rate of 6.37 million units, well above last year’s average 
level.  New home sales also continued to incr ease briskly, jumping 4 pe rcent in June to an 
annual rate of 1.37 million units.  Housing demand continues to receive a boost from low long-term mortgage rates.  Rates on thirty -year fixed-rate mortgages stood at about 
5.8 percent in early August.  However, rates for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages have 
continued to move up gradually—increasing ro ughly 40 basis points so far this year.  
Available indicators suggest that home sales will continue at a good clip in July.  The 
pending home sales index—which provides ad vance information about existing home 
sales in the near term—edged up in June, a nd the four-week moving average of mortgage 
applications for purchase remained in an elevated range. 
 
Prices of existing homes have continued to  climb sharply, while the rate of price 
appreciation for new homes has shown some  signs of moderating.  The average sales 
price of existing homes in June was 9½ percen t higher than that of a year earlier, about 
the same pace of appreciation as twelve months ago.  In the new-home market, the constant-quality price index—which controls for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, and a few other readily measurable attributes—was up 6¾ percent in 
the second quarter from the level of a year earlier, down somewhat from the 9¼ percent 
increase four quarters earlier.  Recent sales of new-home sales have been more heavily 
weighted toward houses priced below the medi an, and, as a result, the average price of 
new homes has decelerated noticeably mo re than the constant-quality index. 
 
Equipment and Software   
Business spending on equipment and software has been expanding at solid, if unspectacular, rates.  We now estimate that  real outlays on equipment and software 
increased at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter, about the same as the first-
quarter pace.  Although outlays for transpor tation equipment s hot up last quarter, 
spending growth outside of this volatile cate gory was markedly slower than earlier in the 
year.  Nonetheless, fundamentals remain conducive to gains in  capital spending:  
Business output continues to expand, fina ncing conditions remain favorable, and 
although increases in corporate cash flow have tapered off over the past year, many firms 
still are holding ample stockpiles of liquid assets.  Moreover, according to survey 
evidence, businesses are optimis tic about the near-term outlook. 
 
In the high-tech sector, real business spending slowed to an annual rate of 15 percent in 
the second quarter from the 26 percent pace in the first quarter, despite another

appreciable increase in real outlays for com puters and peripherals la st quarter.  Spending 
on communications equipment rose at a subdue d pace in the second quarter following a 
large first-quarter gain.  Similarly, incr eases in software spending stepped down 
substantially last qu arter.  However, revenue guida nce from major software vendors 
bodes well for future spending in this category. 
 
Real outlays on transportation equipment jump ed in the second quarter.  Real business 
purchases of light vehicles soared, led by increased demand for high-e nd light trucks.  In 
contrast, real spending for medium and heavy trucks was little changed last quarter.  Still, 
new orders for medium and heavy rigs shot up in June and rose further in July.  Elsewhere in the transportation sector, real business outlays fo r aircraft increased in the 
second quarter—albeit from their lowest leve l in a decade—and domestic orders of 
aircraft picked up in May and June for the first time in a year.  
 
Investment spending on non-high-tech, non transportation equipment declined at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quart er, with the downturn concentrated in the 
machinery category.  Nonetheless, new orders  outstripped shipments again in June, and 
the backlog of unfilled orders rose for the seventeenth consecutive month.  Furthermore, the positive July readings on orders and shipments from the surveys of manufacturers by 
the ISM and the Philadelphia and New York Re serve Banks point to near-term gains in 
this sector. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Although conditions in nonresidential propert y markets seem to be firming a bit, 
spending on nonresidential cons truction remains at low levels.  The vacancy rate for 
industrial buildings began heading down ear ly last year, but even so, outlays on 
manufacturing structures have fallen in the pa st couple of months and have been roughly 
flat since the end of last year.  Spending in other categories has also been uninspiring 
over the past few quarters.  Outlays for commercial buildings have been about flat even though retail vacancy rates continue to be low.  Office construction remains at a 
depressed level despite a downw ard-trending vacancy rate, while outlays in the “other” 
category have been edging down for some ti me.  In the drilling and mining sector, 
expenditures resumed an upward traj ectory in the second quarter.   
 
Business Inventories 
With June data for manufacturing inventor y investment in hand, we now estimate that 
real nonfarm inventories edged down slightly in  the second quarter after having increased

at a rate of $62 billion in the first quarter.  This sharp swing in the pace of real inventory 
investment is estimated to have subtracted 2¼ percentage points from the change in real 
GDP in the second quarter.  While stronger-than -expected sales of li ght vehicles in the 
second quarter contributed to the drop in i nventory investment, the step-down may also 
suggest that efforts that businesses unde rtook to rebuild stocks during 2004 and early 
2005 are largely complete.  Indeed, by the e nd of the second quarter, except for a few 
sectors with sizable overhangs (such as steel and paper), businesse s seemed reasonably 
content with inventory levels.  This view is apparent in recent surveys, which suggest that 
an increasing number of firms are satisfied  with both their own and their customers’ 
inventory positions.   
 
Data from the staff’s flow-o f-goods inventory system are ro ughly consistent with the 
NIPA data.  Inventories declined in May and June, and days’ supply edged down for a 
third straight month.  Inventories appear el evated relative to consumption only for paper 
and, to a lesser degree, for food and for steel held by metal service centers.   
 
Federal Government Sector  
The federal budget picture has improved marked ly in recent months as a result of 
exceptional strength in receipts.   Indeed, al though outlays have continued to rise at the 
relatively rapid pace of the past few years, the deficit in the un ified budget narrowed to 
about $336 billion over the twelve months e nding in June, roughly $100 billion less than 
the twelve-month deficit over th e preceding twelve-month period. 
 
In June, federal tax receipts were nearly 10 percent above their ye ar-earlier level.  
Individual nonwithheld taxes, which are mainly quarterly declarations for tax liability in 
2005, continued to soar, as did corporate income  taxes.  The surge in  corporate receipts 
this year has likely been driven by strong gr owth in economic profits as well as by the 
expiration of the bonus depreciation  provision at the end of 2004.   
 
Outlays in June were 9 percent above thei r year-earlier level and reflected sizable 
increases in net interest pa yments, Medicare spending, and defense expenditures.  Data 
from Daily Treasury Statements for payments to defense vendors in July are consistent 
with further gains in real de fense outlays this quarter.  
 
According to the Mid-Session Review, the Administration now estimates that the budget 
deficit will come in at $333 billion in fiscal  2005, nearly $100 billi on less than had been 
anticipated in February.  The Administrati on has also lowered its projections for

subsequent years and expects the deficit to  fall below $200 billion by 2008.  One reason 
for the downward revision to the longer-run deficit projection is that the Administration 
assumes that much of the surprising streng th in tax collections this spring will be 
permanent; in addition, it has revised up the projected path for the tax base.  In contrast, changes to policy assumptions—in particular, the inclusion of a defense supplemental for 
fiscal 2006 and the phase-in of Social Secu rity personal accounts starting in 2009—tend 
to boost the deficit.  Similarly, the C ongressional Budget Office has reduced its 
projection for the 2005 deficit to the neighborho od of $325 billion; it wi ll release updated 
budget projections in mid-August.

Before leaving on August recess, Congress passed several pieces of legislation.  These include an energy bill that provides tax incentives to the energy sector over the next decade.  In addition, after ten temporary extensions of the surface transportation law that 
had expired two years ago, Congress approve d a six-year highway and mass transit 
reauthorization bill.  The fiscal effects of these two bills are quite similar to what had been assumed in the President’s budget. 
 
II-27 
State and Local Government Sector 
We now estimate that real spending on cons umption and gross inve stment by state and 
local governments rose at an annual rate of  3¼ percent in the se cond quarter after an 
upward revised increase of 1½ perc ent in the first quarter.  The rate of increase in real 
spending also was revised up in 2004.  In the se cond quarter, much of the increase was in 
construction expenditures; spendi ng on consumption items rose at a rate of a bit less than 
1 percent in real terms last quarter, simila r to the average pace over the preceding year. 6  
 
The pickup in aggregate spending by the sector is consistent with reports of strengthening 
fiscal positions among the states.  Income and sales tax collections apparently were quite 
robust this spring, and many states seem to ha ve ended fiscal 2005 (which closed on June 
30 in all but four stat es) with higher balances in thei r operating accounts than they had 
anticipated a few months earlier.   
 
Prices  
The news about recent inflation developments has been favorable.7  The PCE price index 
was flat in June for a second consecutive mont h, bringing the increase for the past three 
months to 1.9 percent (annual rate), 1.5 percentage points be low the rate of the preceding 
three months.  Although a deceleration in ener gy price inflation c ontributed significantly 
to this moderation, increases in the core PCE price index have also slowed markedly in 
the past couple of months. 
 
PCE prices for energy fell 0.6 percent in June after a 2.4 percent decline in May.  Over 
the twelve months ending in June, the pr ice index for energy rose 7.6 percent, a 
considerable slowdown compared with the 18 percent increase posted twelve months earlier.  Crude oil prices have rebounded subs tantially since mid-June, and survey data 
point to sharp price increa ses for gasoline in July. 
 
The food component of the PCE price i ndex was unchanged in June for a second 
consecutive month.  Prices of fruits and ve getables reversed earlier run-ups—which had 
reflected very tight supplies during the transi tion from the winter harvest to the spring  
                                                 
6 The second-quarter estimate for the growth in r eal spending by state and local governments is 
¾ percentage point higher than the BEA’s advance estimate.  The revision is based on monthly 
construction data, which became ava ilable after the NIPA release.  
7 Although core PCE price inflation over the four quarters of 2004 was revised up 0.6 percentage point 
to 2.2 percent in the NIPA annual revision, the revision largely occurred in nonmarket components, which 
have decelerated considerably in the first half of 2005.  Market-based co re PCE prices were little revised.  
See the appendix for more detail on the effect of the NIPA annual revision.

harvest—and these price declines  offset price increases in other food categories.  During 
the twelve months ending in June, food prices rose 2.1 percent, about 1 percentage point 
less than during the preceding year.  Mo re recently, wholesale meat prices fell 
substantially after a judicial ruling on July 15 that allowed the resumption of imports of 
young Canadian cattle into the United States; this  change will likely help restrain retail 
consumer food prices by a small amount in the months ahead.   
 
Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index ro se at an annual rate of 1½ percent in 
the three months ending in June after having posted significantly larger increases earlier in the year.  Much of the recent slowdown has been in core goods prices, which had been 
pushed up noticeably by higher prices for imports, energy, and core intermediate 
materials last year.  Prices of core servi ces have also decelerated recently, though much 
less than the slowing in goods prices.  Th e market-based components of core PCE 
inflation also have moderated of late, rising at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the three 
months ending in June, down from a 2½ per cent rate during the preceding three months.  
During the twelve months ending in June, overall core PCE pri ces rose just under 
2 percent, a shade less than the upward -revised increase of one year earlier. 
 
Most broader measures of inflation have decelerated a bit during the past year.  In the 
four quarters ending last quarter, GDP prices decelerated about ½ percentage point from 
the year-earlier pace.  Excl uding food and energy items, GDP  price inflation has been 
about steady near 2½ percent as a slowdown in  investment price in flation about offset 
faster price increases fo r government purchases.   
 
Survey measures of inflation expectations have been mixed in recent months.  After 
having hovered around 3¼ percent from Ma rch through June, median year-ahead 
inflation expectations as measured by the Mi chigan Survey moved down to 3 percent in 
July.  By contrast, median five- to ten-year inflation expectati ons ticked up a tenth in July 
to 2.9 percent but still remained in the narro w range observed over the past few years.  
 
At earlier stages of processi ng, the producer price index for core intermediate materials 
fell 0.2 percent in June after declining 0.3 percent in May.  During the three months 
ending in June, core intermediate materials declined at an annual rate of 1¼ percent—a 
striking turnaround from the 6½ pe rcent rate of increase that was posted in the first three 
months of this year.  Outside of energy, co mmodity prices have also been relatively 
subdued lately.  Although the Journal of Commerce industria ls index, which includes a 
substantial energy component, has edged up r ecently, the Commodity Research Bureau

spot industrials index, which excludes energy it ems, has fallen 2.4 percent.  Nonetheless, 
both measures of commodity prices have remain ed at an elevated level since the end of 
2003. 
 
Labor Costs 
Over the three months ending in June, th e Employment Cost Index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation in private industr y rose at an annual rate of  just 2½ percent, a second 
consecutive reading of meager compensation ga ins.  As of the end of June, the twelve-
month increase in the ECI was 3¼ percent,  ¾ percentage point less than in the 
comparable period twelve months earlier.   
 
Over the twelve months ending in June, th e wages and salaries component of the ECI 
rose 2½ percent, roughly the same increase as over the previous year.  However, benefit 
costs rose 5 percent during th e twelve months ending in June, a slowdown of almost 
2½ percentage points relative to the rate of the preceding year.  Much of the slowdown in 
benefit costs was due to smaller increases in contributions to retirement and saving 
programs; many companies likely have benefited from the rebound in equity prices over 
the past two years and therefor e have less need to make up for earlier losses sustained by 
their defined-benefit pension plans.  In addi tion, increases in costs for health insurance, 
which had slowed to the 7 percent to 8 percent range in recent quarters,  eased further in 
the June report, and the twelve-month cha nge stood at 6¼ percent, well below the 
double-digit increases of a few years ago.   
 
Using the most recent NIPA data, the staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 3½ percent in  the second quarter.  
This pace is down sharply from increases of 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, in the 
preceding two quarters, when a year-end burst of bonuses and exercises of stock options 
apparently pushed up this measure of comp ensation considerably.  Unit labor costs are 
estimated to have risen at a 1½ percent rate  in the second quarter, far below the outsized 
increases posted in recent quarters.

II-A-1                                                      Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 
 
The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 29, 
affected data back to the beginning of 2002.   The revision allowed the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA) to incorporate more-comprehensi ve source data, including data from tax records 
and economic surveys, and to make methodologi cal changes.  Although this year’s revision 
mainly reflected the incorporation of new source data, BEA also made two noteworthy changes to their methods.  First, it began using the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services Survey as the source 
for data on investment in computer softwa re and for several components of PCE services.
1  
Second, it improved its estimates of the pri ce of implicit services of commercial banks.2   
 
On a four-quarter change basis, real GDP grow th was revised down 0.4 percentage point in both 
2002 and 2003 and 0.1 percentage point in 2004.  Much of the downward revision was 
concentrated in personal consum ption expenditures and investment in equipment and software.  
The downward revision to the change in real PC E was primarily due to updated information from 
two Census Bureau surveys:  The Service Annua l Survey and the American Housing Survey.  
The largest source of downward revision to the change in real E&S was shipments data on high-tech equipment from the Census Bureau’s A nnual Survey of Manufactures.  In the nonfarm 
business sector, we estimate that the four-quarter ch ange in real output per hour will be revised 
down 0.6 percentage point in 2002, 0.5 percentage  point in 2003, and 0.2 percentage point in 
2004.   
 
The BEA also revised its price indexes.  The av erage change in the GDP price index was revised 
up 0.2 percentage point per year from the fourth quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2004.  
Core PCE inflation was also revised up about 0.2 percentage point per year during the same 
period, with most of the upward revision occurring in 2004.  Most of the revision to core PCE inflation was due to changes in two nonmarket pi eces: medical insurance and implicit services of 
financial institutions other than commercial banks.  The index for core market-based PCE prices was little revised. 
 
On the income side of the accounts, the growth rate of gross domestic income was revised down 
in each of the open years and in the first quarter of this year.  The revisions to gross domestic 
income were, on average, larger than those to GDP, and in the first quarter of 2005, the revised 
statistical discrepancy was closer to zero than pr eviously reported.  The growth rate of real 
disposable personal income was, on balance, revised  down, mainly in 2004 and the first quarter of

other transportation services, and refuse collection.

implicit services of commercial banks but did not have a large net effect on these series.

2005.  Because personal outlays were revised down even more in 2002 and 2003 (largely because 
of downward–revised personal c onsumption expenditures), the pe rsonal saving rate was revised 
up 0.6 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 0.7 percentage point in the fourth 
quarter of 2003.  However, the personal saving rate was revised up only 0.1 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2004, and it was revised down 0. 2 percentage point in the first quarter of this 
year.   
 
Corporate economic profits were revised up in 2002 and most of 2003 (in large part to reflect new 
data from the Internal Revenue Service).  However, profits were revised down in 2004, 
principally because the BEA made a special adjustment to account for the apparent increase in stock-option exercises in late 2004.  The BE A used footnotes from corporations’ financial 
statements to make its estimate of the effect of these exercises.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Developments in financial markets over th e intermeeting period suggest that investors 
have become more confident of prospects for solid economic growth.  Market participants are now virtually certain of a quarter-point incr ease in the target federal 
funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting, a nd they have marked up the expected path 
of policy thereafter.  Yields on nominal Tr easury coupon securities  rose substantially, 
primarily reflecting higher real yields; in flation compensation based on TIPS yields was 
about unchanged.  Favorable corporate earnings reports for the second quarter lifted stock 
prices, credit spreads on specu lative-grade bonds narrowed cons iderably, and measures of 
corporate credit quality remained strong.  Busi ness debt expanded at a moderate pace in 
the second quarter and in July, and early indi cators suggest that household debt growth 
likely eased in the second quarter from the first quarter’s brisk pace.  
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The FOMC’s decision at its June meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis 
points and the accompanying statement were about  in line with investors’ expectations 
and prompted only a limited market reaction.  Subsequent economic data releases and 
corporate earnings reports supporting an outl ook for strong economic growth led market 
participants to raise their expected path for the fede ral funds rate.  On net over the 
intermeeting period, the expected policy path shifted up about 35 basis points, to a touch 
above 4 percent by year-end 2005, and up roughly 45 basis points, to nearly 4¼ percent, by the end of next year.  Surveys suggest that investors are certain of  a quarter-point hike 
in the target federal funds rate at the A ugust meeting and believe that the FOMC will 
make only modest changes to the accompanying policy statement. 
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities at two-  and ten-year maturiti es have risen about 
40 basis points and 30 basis points, respectivel y, since the June FOMC  meeting, which is 
consistent with changes in policy expectati ons.  The July 7 terrorist attacks in London 
prompted a transitory safe-haven rally in the Treasury market, but yields returned to pre-
attack levels the next day.  Yields rose on July 21 after the Chinese government 
unexpectedly announced a revalu ation of the yuan, although much of the increase was 
reversed over the following days on indications  that further revaluations would not be 
forthcoming in the near term.  Inflation-inde xed Treasury yields move d up about in line 
with nominal yields over the intermeeting pe riod, leaving inflation compensation little 
changed on net.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates  
Corporate earnings reports that generally b eat forecasts and the largely positive economic 
news lifted stock prices over the intermee ting period, with major equity indexes rising 
3 to 7¼ percent.  The trend-adjusted twelve -month forward earnings-price ratio was little 
changed at around 5½ percent and remains in the narrow range registered since early 
2004.  The spread between this measure and th e real perpetuity Tr easury yield—a rough 
gauge of the equity risk premium—held st eady over the intermeeting period at a level 
above its average over the past two decades.  Implied volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 
and S&P 500 remained at historically low levels.  Spreads on BBB-rated bonds were down about 10 basis points.  Speculative-grade bond 
yields declined, and their credit spreads narro wed nearly 60 basis point s.  Currently, these 
spreads are only about 40 basis points above the very low levels touche d earlier this year.  
Quality spreads on commercial paper remained low.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality  
Reports from about 400 of the S&P 500 firms indicate that second-qua rter earnings per 
share likely increased about 13 percent from  four quarters earlier, and gains were 
registered broadly across sectors.  That increase implies a 3 percent advance from the first quarter to the second quart er (seasonally adjusted quarterly  rate).  Analysts’ forecasts 
of year-ahead earnings for the S&P 500 firm s were revised upward between mid-June 
and mid-July; the increase mainly reflected positive revisions to forecasts for energy 
firms.  Excluding these firms, revisions were , on balance, a touch negative and about in 
the range seen since mid-2004.  Overall, the financial position of nonfinancial firms continue s to be strong, with firms 
still holding large stocks of li quid assets.  The dollar volume of corporate bonds that were 
downgraded increased in the second quarter, la rgely reflecting the downgrades of General 
Motors and Ford debt; among other firms,  ratings upgrades about kept pace with 
downgrades.  In June, both the realized si x-month trailing defau lt rate on bonds and the 
expected year-ahead default rate based on KM V’s firm-level estimates remained low.  
 
Business Finance  
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in June and July from the 
lackluster figures posted in  April and May, but hefty re tirements have left net bond 
issuance only slightly positive in the past couple of months.  Short-term borrowing in 
July was robust:  Commercial paper outs tanding rebounded after large quarter-end

paydowns that had damped second-quarter growth, and bank loans to businesses 
advanced briskly.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices, U.S. banks, on net, eased st andards further on C&I loans over the past 
three months even as demand for loans con tinued to firm.  On balance, net business 
borrowing through bank loans, commercial paper, and bonds in July stepped up from the moderate pace recorded in the fi rst two quarters of this year. 
 Gross public equity issuance was sluggish in the second quarter and remained so in July, 
although new registrations with the Securi ties and Exchange Commission suggest a 
pickup in IPOs in coming months.  The outsized first-quarter figures for equity 
retirements appear to have been surpassed in the second quarter, as strong profits and 
large cash positions continued to bolster cash-financed mergers and share repurchases.  Hence, net equity issuance probably dropped ev en further into nega tive territory last 
quarter.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Growth of commercial mortga ge debt likely maintained a double-digit pace in the second 
quarter, as the issuance of co mmercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) set a record; 
the calendar of offerings suggests another larg e volume in the current quarter.  Spreads 
on BBB-rated CMBS widened in the second quarter  and in July and we re likely pressured 
higher by the heavy issuance.  Delinquency rates on CMBS declin ed further in June.  The 
ratio of net operating income to property pric es, an indicator of the rate of return on 
commercial real estate, edged dow n further in the second quarter .  Even so, the spread of 
this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasur y yield, a rough proxy fo r the risk premium on 
commercial real estate assets, widened somewh at in the second quarter but remained in 
the lower part of the range observed over the past decade. 
 
Household Finance 
Household debt is estimated to have expande d briskly in the second quarter but a bit less 
rapidly than earlier this year .  Mortgage debt growth likely eased a bit in the second 
quarter because of increases in mortgage rates and—based on pri ces of existing homes—
a possibly reduced pace of home price apprec iation.  Since the last FOMC meeting, rates 
on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen a bout in line with ten- year Treasury yields.  
Boosted by stronger retail sales in June, consumer credit grow th appears to have picked 
up from the tepid pace reco rded in April and May.

The ratio of financial obligations to dispos able personal income is estimated to have 
ticked up in the second quarter.  Bankruptcy  filings have fallen somewhat in recent 
weeks, but they remain high, as many households evidently have been filing before the new bankruptcy law takes effect in October.   Other indicators of household credit quality 
have held steady at favorable levels.   The small rise in stock prices in the second qua rter points to a slight increase in the ratio 
of household net worth to disposable pers onal income.  Net purchases of long-term 
mutual fund shares picked up in July from the second quarter pace, although net flows to 
domestic equity funds remained sluggish. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Consistent with the improvement in the fe deral budget in recent months, issuance of 
nominal Treasury securities has continued to  decline, and the qua ntity of twenty-year 
TIPS auctioned in July was below market proj ections.  Nonetheless, demand at auctions 
over the intermeeting period was lackluster, with  bid-to-cover ratios in  the lower half of 
recent ranges.  The proportion of issues aw arded to indirect bidders—a rough proxy for 
demand from foreign official  institutions—averaged a bit above the levels reported 
earlier this year.  An alte rnative indicator of foreign official demand, the value of 
Treasury securities held in custody at the Fe deral Reserve Bank of New York on behalf 
of foreign official instituti ons, increased over the intermee ting period at about the pace 
registered earlier in the year.    In the August mid-quarter re funding statement, the Treasury announced that it would 
reintroduce regular semi-annual issuance of a thirty-year no minal bond, with the auction 
calendar to be released in November.  Th e decision had been widely anticipated and 
prompted little market reaction.    The stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac declined 6 and 3 percent, respectively, 
amid investor concerns about legislati on that would likely re sult in smaller GSE 
investment portfolios.  Spreads of yields on GSE senior and subordi nated unsecured debt 
over those on comparable Treasury s ecurities were litt le changed.   
 
State and Local Government Finance  
In July, gross issuance of long-term muni cipal bonds to finan ce new capital projects 
exceeded the robust pace seen in the second quarter, and short-term issuance also edged 
up.  Credit quality in this sector has shown modest improvement this year, as rating

period, the ratio of municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields ticked 
down.  
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 accelerated to an annual rate  of 6 percent in June, an increase likely fueled by tax-
related flows and prepayments associated w ith mortgage refinanc ing activity, but M2 
slowed in July as these factors wane d.  Among the components of M2, small time 
deposits, whose rates of return adjust quickly to changes in market rates, continued to 
expand briskly in June and Jul y, while liquid deposits and re tail money funds were little 
changed, on balance.  Overall, M2 has grown somewhat faster this year than would be 
predicted by its historical re lationship with GDP and the oppor tunity cost of M2 assets; 
this growth perhaps has been boosted by the flattening of the yield curve.  
 Bank credit picked up a bit in July, after a d eceleration in June that reflected a runoff in 
securities holdings.  Real estate lending grew sharply last month, supported by robust 
activity in both the commercial and resident ial segments.  Consumer loans picked up 
from a moderate pace, perhaps with a boost fr om strong automobile sales.  C&I lending, 
which has been bolstered by leveraged buyout s and merger and ac quisition activity in 
recent months, was strong again in July.  By  contrast, other loans, which are quite 
volatile, declined sharply in Ju ly after expanding in June.

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The July 2005 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also queried banks about their current holdings and recent originations a nd securitizations of nontraditional mortgage 
products.  This appendix is based on r esponses from fifty-four domestic banking 
institutions and twenty U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Domestic commercial banks reported a furthe r easing of lending standards and terms for 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, in contrast, lending standards and terms for these types of loans were little changed over the same period.  On net, domestic banks experienced stronge r demand for C&I loans over the past three 
months, while foreign institutions indicated that demand for business loans was about unchanged.  Both domestic and foreign institutions reported stronger demand for 
commercial real estate loans, on balance, a nd a few respondents, on net, reported having 
eased standards on such loans.  A notable net fraction of domestic respondents reported 
stronger demand for loans to purchase homes over the past three months, while a small net percentage of banks also experienced  a strengthening in demand for consumer 
loans. On net, credit standards for residen tial mortgages and consumer loans were about 
unchanged in the July survey, but a significant proportion of respondents indicated increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.  In response to a set of special questions  on nontraditional mortga ge products, domestic 
banks generally reported that such loans accounted for less than a quarter of their 
residential mortgage originations and of the mortgages on their books.  More than one-
half of respondents, however, noted that th e share of mortgage originations accounted 
for by nontraditional mortgage products had been higher over the past twelve months 
than over the previous twelve-month period.  
C&I Lending  
In the July survey, domestic banks reported a further net easing of standards and terms 
for C&I loans.  About 15 percent of res pondents, on net, reported having eased their 
credit standards for loans to large and middle- market firms over the past three months, a 
slightly lower net fraction than in recent su rveys.  On balance, 50 percent of domestic 
banks indicated that they had reduced the co sts of credit lines for such firms in July, up 
from 40 percent in the April survey.  About 45 percent—a somewhat smaller net percentage than in the previous survey—re ported that they had narrowed spreads of

loan rates over their cost of funds.  Do mestic respondents also reported having eased 
other lending terms over the past three mont hs:  About one-fourth of banks, on net, 
increased the maximum size and the maximum maturity of credit lines they are willing to extend to large and middle-market firms.  In contrast, U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks—customers of which are likely to be larger firms—indicated that their 
lending standards and terms for C&I loans were little changed over the past three 
months.  For C&I loans to small firms, 11 pe rcent of domestic banks, on net, noted that 
they had eased their lending standards—dow n from about 20 percent in April—and 
about one-third of respondents reported having trimmed spreads of loan rates over their 
cost of funds.    As in recent surveys, almost all domestic banks that reported having eased their lending 
standards and terms in the July survey cited more-aggressive competition from other 
banks or nonbank lenders as an important reas on for having done so.  Large fractions of 
those respondents also cited an increased tolera nce for risk and a more favorable or less 
uncertain economic outlook as reasons for th eir move toward a less-stringent lending 
posture.  Demand for business loans reportedly strengthened over the past three months.  Forty percent of domestic banks saw stronger de mand for C&I loans from large and middle-
market firms, on balance—about the same shar e as in the April survey.  In contrast, 
foreign institutions reported that demand for C&I loans was about unchanged over the 
past three months.  About one-third of dom estic respondents also experienced stronger 
loan demand from small firms.  As was the case in the April survey, a large majority of 
the domestic respondents that saw stronge r loan demand pointed to borrowers’ 
increased financing needs for accounts receivable and inventories as well as for investment in plant and equipment as having driven the rise in demand.  A substantial fraction of domestic banks also pointed to a rise in merger and acquisition activity as 
having boosted demand for C&I loans.  Re garding future business, 27 percent of 
domestic and 15 percent of foreign respondent s, on net, indicated that inquiries from 
potential business borrowers had increased over the past three months, down from about 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the April survey.  
Commercial Real Estate Lending   
On net, 13 percent of domestic banks reported an easing of lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the past three months, about half the fraction that did so in the April survey.  All but one of th e thirteen foreign branches and agencies active 
in commercial real estate lending reported unc hanged standards on this type of loan.  
About one-fourth of domestic respondents, on net, experienced an increase in demand 
for commercial real estate loans over the past  three months, about the same share as in 
 III-A-5   
 
 
the April survey.  On net, 15 percent of fo reign institutions indicated that demand for 
this type of loan had increased, down from one-third in April.  
Households Lending 
About one-fifth of domestic institutions repor ted in the July survey that they had 
become more willing to make consumer installment loans over the previous three months, a somewhat larger share than in Ap ril.  However, standards and terms on credit 
card and non-credit-card consumer loans were reportedly little changed, on net, over the 
same period.  A modest net fraction of ba nks reported stronger demand for consumer 
loans in the July survey.  Credit standards on residential mortgage lo ans were reportedly unchanged in the July 
survey.  Demand for mortgages to purchase homes strengthened over the past three months:  One-fifth of domestic respondents,  on net, reporting stronger demand for such 
loans.  The July survey included a set of special  questions on banks’ current holdings and 
recent originations and securitizations of  residential mortgages that could be 
categorized as nontraditional mortgage produc ts.  These products include—but are not 
limited to—adjustable-rate mortgages with  multiple payment options, interest-only 
mortgages, and so-called “Alt-A” products , such as mortgages with limited income 
verification and mortgages secured by non-owner-occupied properties.
1 
 About one-third of domestic respondents indicated that the share of residential mortgages on their books that could be cl assified as nontraditional mortgage products 
was less than 5 percent, and another third re ported that the share of such products was 
between 5 percent and 15 percent.  These shares are roughly similar if the responses are weighted by the respondent banks’ dollar vol umes of residential mortgages outstanding 
at the end of the first quarter.  Only one  bank indicated that nontraditional mortgage 
products accounted for more than one-hal f of residential mortgages on its books. 
 About one-third of domestic respondents reporte d that over the past twelve months the 
share of their residential mortgage originations that could be categorized as nontraditional products had been less than 5 percent.  An additional 43 percent of 
respondents indicated that their share of nontraditional mortgage originations was between 5 percent and 25 percent over the sam e period.  Banks reporting shares in this

range accounted for about 75 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of the 
survey respondents at the end of the first quarter.  More than half of respondent banks indicated  that the share of nontraditional residential 
mortgage originations over the past twelve months was higher than it had been over the 
previous twelve-month period.  Twelve percen t of respondents noted that this share was 
substantially higher.  A large majority of respondents reported that their bank had securitized less than one-quarter of nontraditional mortgages originated over the past year.  These institutions accounted for about one-half of the residen tial mortgages on all respondents’ books.  In 
contrast, three large banks—which accounted for almost 40 percent of the respondents’ 
residential mortgages outstanding—indicated that the share of nontraditional mortgage originations that had been securitized exceeded  75 percent.  On balance, a majority of 
the banks indicated that they were less likely to securitize nontraditional mortgage products than traditional mortgages.  Ho wever, three large institutions—which 
accounted for more than 40 percent of the residential mortgages of the respondents—indicated that they were more likely to securitize nontraditional mortgage products.  Banks were also asked about the share of residential mortgages on their books used to 
finance purchases of second homes or homes for investment purposes.  A substantial majority of banks indicated that this shar e was less than 10 percent.  Most respondents 
also indicated that over the past year, the shar e of residential mortgage originations used 
to finance purchases of second homes or homes for investment purposes was less than  10 percent.  One-fourth of the respondents noted that the share of originations accounted for by such loans was moderately higher over the past twelve months relative 
to the previous twelve-month period.  Banks with larger mortgage portfolios were more 
likely to report an increase in this share.

In May, the value of exports of goods and serv ices increased slightly  from April’s strong 
level, as higher services e xports were partly offset by a moderation in exports of goods.  
Within goods, exports of agricultural pr oducts and consumer goods both increased 
sharply, while exports of industrial supplies increased at a moderate pace.  However, 
these gains were more than offset by weak er exports of both automotive products and 
capital equipment, as aircraft exports ste pped down from April’s elevated level.   
 The average value of exports in April and May increased 17½ percent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter.  Exports of capital goods showed  the strongest gai n, although exports of 
industrial supplies, agricultura l goods, and services also moved up markedly relative to 
the first quarter.  The value of imported goods and services de creased almost 1 percent in May, led by a 
sharp decline in the value of oil imports.  Imports of non- oil goods also decreased, with 
both industrial supplies and capital goods e xhibiting significant declines, more than 
offsetting a brisk increase in imports of auto motive products and a modest gain in imports 
of consumer goods.  Services im ports increased moderately.

On average, the value of imports  in April and May increased 8 percent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter, as an increase in the value of oil imports and higher imports of capital goods 
more than offset lower imports of automotive products and consumer goods.     
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In June, the prices of U.S. im ports of non-oil goods and of core goods 
both fell 0.4 percent, marking the second consecutive month of falling prices.  As in May, the main contribution to the price decline came from non-oil industrial supplies.  After 
increasing briskly in March and April, the price index for non-oil industrial supplies fell 
1.1 percent in May before declining another 1.1 percent in June, mainly on lower prices for natural gas and metals.  Food prices fell 1.7 percent in June, reflecting lower 
vegetable prices.  After larg e price increases ea rlier in the year, the finished goods 
categories had only small price movements in June.  Prices for both automotive products and capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) were unchanged in June.  
The price index for consumer goods fell 0.1 pe rcent.  Prices for computers increased 
0.1 percent in May, and prices for semiconductors fell 0.1 percent.    In the second quarter, NIPA core import prices  rose 2.1 percent at an  annual rate.  The 
main contributors to the overall price increa se were foods and non-oil industrial supplies, 
where large price increases in March and April were only partially undone in May and 
June.  In the second quarter, the import pri ce for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) increased about 2 percent, a mu ch slower rate of increase than in the 
first quarter.  Automotive produc ts and consumer goods saw only small price increases.   
 Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil rose 7.6 pe rcent in June.  The spot price of West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose more  sharply in June, up 13 percent to average 
nearly $56.50 per barrel.  The spot price rose  late in May from a bout $50 per barrel to 
over $60 per barrel in late June as storms in the Gulf of Mexico th reatened oil production 
and refining infrastructure.  In  July, the spot price averaged  $58.70 per barrel and closed 
at $60.87 per barrel on August 3.  This recent run-up owes, in part, to several production 
disruptions and delays as well as the death of King Fahd of Sa udi Arabia.  The prices of 
heavier grades of crude oil have  also increased, but not to as great an extent as the price 
of WTI.  In addition to ongoing concern a bout this hurricane season, oil prices remain 
elevated because of expected strong worl d oil demand going forward, concerns about 
future supplies from Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia, and limited spare 
production capacity in OPEC.  The price of th e far-dated futures contract (currently for 
delivery in December 2011) closed  at $59.19 per barrel on August 3.

Exports.   In June, the prices of U.S. exports  of total goods and of core goods were 
unchanged from May.  A 1.2 percent increase in prices for agricultural products offset a 
0.6 percent fall in prices of non-agricultural industrial supp lies and a 0.2 percent fall in 
the prices of exported consumer goods.  Export prices for both capital goods and 
automotive products rose 0.1 percent.  Pric es of exported comput ers fell 0.4 percent, 
whereas prices for semiconducto rs increased 0.3 percent.  
 In the second quarter, prices of core exports (on a NIPA basis) rose 4 percent at an annual 
rate.  Prices for agricultura l products and non-agri cultural industrial supplies increased 
briskly.  Prices for capital goods (excludi ng computers and semiconductors) rose 1¾ 
percent.  Prices for both automotive pr oducts and consumer goods increased only 
slightly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securi ties slowed for the f ourth consecutive month 
in May (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. Inte rnational Transactions table).  Although, on  
net, private foreigners purchased agency bonds (line 4b) for the first time in four months, 
these purchases were more than offset by declines in private purchases of Treasury 
securities (line 4a) and corporate stocks (lin e 4d).  Net purchases of  corporate bonds (line 
4c) remained fairly strong.  Foreign official inflows (line 1)  also slowed in May, after a si zeable inflow in April.  The 
easing is primarily attributed to countries other than the G10 a nd OPEC: Norway, which 
actively manages its oil fund, contributed sign ificantly to this sl owing.  Inflows from 
China have remained relatively strong so far this year.  Partial and confidential data on 
custody accounts at FRBNY indicate further siza ble foreign official inflows in June and 
July.    
 U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) continued at their recent pace in May.  Net 
purchases of stocks (line 5b) moved back to wards recent levels, while U.S. purchases of 
foreign bonds (line 5a) ticked up from April’s le vel.  However, it is difficult to know how 
much of this increase reflects larger purch ases and how much reflects more complete 
reporting, given the effects of the ongoing review  of the TIC data on net transactions in 
foreign bonds.    The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a large net infl ow in May, which more than 
offset the sizeable outflow in April.  For th e year to date, the banki ng sector has recorded 
a net outflow of less than $1 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The trade-weighted major currencies index of  the dollar declined sl ightly, 3/4 percent on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  The dollar ap preciated early in the period as short- and 
long-term dollar-denominated inte rest rates increased more th an those of other industrial 
currencies, buoyed by data reinforcing the view that economic growth in the United 
States would likely continue to outpace that of Europe and Japan.  However, the dollar 
later more than fully retraced these gains alt hough interest rate differentials registered no 
further changes.  Major equity indexes rose across the globe over the period, driven by a 
number of better-than-expected earnings re ports.  On July 21, China announced a major 
change to its exchange rate regime, incl uding an immediate 2.1 percent appreciation of 
the renminbi versus the dollar.  On a bilate ral basis, the dollar de preciated 1-3/4 percent 
on balance against the euro and 3/4 percent versus the Canadian dollar.  The dollar 
appreciated 1/2 percent versus  the yen and 1 percent agai nst sterling.  Much of the 
dollar’s movement versus sterling came in  reaction to weaker-than-expected U.K. 
economic data and preceded the terrorist bombings in London on July 7.

                  The three-month sterling spot interest rate declined 13 basis points  over the intermeeting 
period.  At the July 7 meeting of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee,  
four of the nine members voted for a cut in the repo rate, and, at the August 4 meeting, 
the MPC lowered the Bank’s repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent, citing a 
slowdown in the growth rate s of household spending and business investment.  Yields 
implied by sterling interest rate futures curren tly show that the mark et is assigning some 
probability to another 25-basis-point cut by the Bank of England by early next year.  
Three-month euro interest rates were lit tle changed on net; statements by several 
European Central Bank officials during the pe riod appeared to be tailored to quash 
market expectations of any m onetary easing in the euro area in the near term.  Ten-year 
sovereign yields rose about 20 basis point s in Europe and Japan, less than the 30 
basis-point increase in  the benchmark Treasury yield.  Ja panese yields were boosted by 
press reports that some members of the Ba nk of Japan’s Policy Board had expressed a 
belief that Japanese consumer prices would begin increasing by year’s end.  Headline 
equity indexes rose about 2 percent in Japan and about 4 percent in the euro area and the 
United Kingdom over the period.  Stock pr ices were boosted by many stronger-than-
expected earnings reports, pa rticularly in the energy sector, which continued to be 
supported by rising crude oil prices.  Financial Indicators in Major Industrial Countries

In emerging markets, the main event of th e period was the long-awaited change in 
China’s exchange rate regime, although the ultimate extent of the change remains 
uncertain.  On July 21, the Chinese author ities announced that th e renminbi would no 
longer be pegged to the dollar at  a rate near 8.28 yuan per dollar.   Instead, the authorities 
announced that they were moving to a “managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a ba sket of currencies.”  The exchange value 
of the renminbi against the dollar was m oved immediately to 8.11 yuan per dollar, a 
revaluation of  2.1 percent.  China’s announ cement raised some immediate speculation 
that the relatively small in itial step could soon be follo wed by further exchange rate 
moves, but on July 26 the People’s Bank of China issued a statement warning market 
IV-12 
participants not to expect a dditional substantial exchange ra te moves in the near term.  
Since July 21, the exchange rate, heavily managed by official Chinese institutions, has 
registered only very small fluctuations near 8.11 yuan per dollar.  The role of the 
currency basket in the management of the renm inbi exchange rate, as well as the basket’s 
composition, remains unclear for now.    China’s announcement was immediately follow ed by sizable movements in the exchange 
rates of a number of Asian currencies against the dollar, but these movements were largely retraced in the ensuing days.  Malaysia also ended it s formal peg of the ringgit to 
the dollar soon after China’s announcement.   On net over the period, the dollar 
depreciated about 2 percent against the Kor ean won and the Singapore dollar, and about 
1 percent versus the Malaysian ringgit.  The dollar was little changed against the Thai 
baht and Taiwan dollar.  Hong Kong did not change its exchange rate regime, and its 
currency only registered very small fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.  Equity prices rose substantially in a numb er of Asian markets over the period, led by a 10 percent 
increase in Korea.  In Latin America, the dollar depreciated about 1-1/2 percen t against the Mexican peso 
and the Brazilian real.  Brazilian asset prices experien ced much volatility early in the 
period on concerns that President Lula may become implicat ed in a growing bribes-for-
votes scandal in Brazil’s congre ss, but these concerns seemed to  abate late in the period.  
On net, equity prices rose 6 percent in Br azil, 8 percent in Mexi co, and 10 percent in 
Argentina.  The Argentine sovereign yield spr ead over Treasuries decl ined sharply due to 
the issuance of new debt replacing old defaulted securities.  Mexico’s EMBI+ spread declined 21 basis points from an  already very low level.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Growth in the foreign industrial economies appears to have turned down a bit in the 
second quarter, with the United Kingdom, Ja pan, and the euro area all showing evidence 
of slowing.  Japanese industri al production fell slightly on average in the second quarter.  
The preliminary GDP estimate for the United Kingdom indicates growth of 1.5 percent in 
the second quarter, as the pace of expa nsion in the construction, service, and 
manufacturing sectors slowed from the first qua rter rate.  In the euro area, the external 
sector exerted a drag on growth, as the trad e surplus through May was down relative to 
the first quarter.  In contrast, Canadian r eal GDP seems to have accelerated slightly, 
according to monthly GDP estimates.   Consumer price inflation remained subdued ove rall.  In the euro area, core inflation 
posted its slowest rate since early 2001 in J une, but headline inflation moved up to 2.2 
percent in July.  In Canada, consumer prices  continued rising at m oderate rates.  The 
inflation rate in the United Kingdom moved up to the Bank of England’s 2 percent target 
in June.  Mild deflation persisted in Japan.  In Japan , real workers’ household spending fell 1.4 percent in June, while retail sales 
rose 0.1 percent, following a 1.4 percent declin e in May.  In the second quarter, retail 
sales grew more than 3 percent from a year ago, the fastest rate of  growth since the mid-
1990s.  Tokyo department store sales were flat in June. 
 After falling 2.8 percent in May, industrial production increased by 1.5 percent in June. 
Investment indicators released since the last FOMC meeting were mixed.  Core 
machinery orders fell 6.7 percent in May, but  the Bank of Japan’s July Tankan index of 
private capital investment pl ans for large firms in all i ndustries projects expenditure 
growth of 9.4 percent in FY 2005, a substantial increase from the March survey.  Overall, 
firms view business conditions as improvi ng.  The Tankan diffusion index of business 
conditions for firms of all sizes and industrie s bounced back in June to its December 
level, after dipping in March.  The extern al sector continues to make negative 
contributions to growth:  real  exports of goods rose 1 percen t in June while real imports 
of goods rose 4 percent.    Japanese labor markets continue to gradua lly improve. The unemployment rate declined 
to 4.2 percent in June, the lowest level since 1998 and employment rose 30,000 in the 
second quarter, slightly faster than the firs t-quarter pace.  Total cash earnings (which 
IV-14 
include overtime pay and bonuses) rose 1.3 percent in June from one year ago, the 
biggest increase in two years.  Nationwide core consumer prices (which exclude fresh 
food but include energy) fell 0.2 percent in June from a year ago.

Data for the euro area  suggest that growth was weak  in the second quarter.  After 
providing considerable stimulus to  growth in the first quarter,  the external sector appears 
to have been a drag on growth in the s econd quarter; the euro area trade surplus was 
down in April and May relative to the first qua rter, as imports grew faster than exports.  
Euro-area retail sales rebounded in May and J une from a particularly weak showing in 
April, but retail sales for the second quarter as a whole were down 0.2 percent from the 
first quarter.  Euro-area industrial production declined  0.3 percent in May; however, recent 
improvement in business sentiment suggests th at industrial activity may be picking up.  
Driven by a rise in industrial confidence, the European Commission’s measure of euro-
area economic sentiment turned up in June after falling in May to its lo west level in more 
than a year and a half.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI moved back above the 50 
IV-15 
threshold for growth in July for the first time since March.  The PMI for the services 
sector remained around 53, near where it has been for much of the past year.  The 
German IFO index of manufacturing sentiment continued on a positive trend and rose significantly in July.  Labor markets conditions showed some improvement, with the euro-area unemployment rate edging down to 8.8 percent in May and re maining there in June.  In Germany, the 
national definition of the unemployment rate al so moved slightly lo wer to 11.6 percent in 
July.  Euro-area twelve-month consumer price inflati on rose to 2.2 percent in July, above the 
ECB ceiling.  In contrast, core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, slipped to 1.4 percent in June.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 1.5 percent (a.r.) in the second quarte r, according 
to the preliminary estimate.  Service sector output grew 2.4 percent while total output 
from the production industries fe ll 1.6 percent; both were slow er than their first-quarter 
paces.  Output of the construction sector co ntinued to slow, rising 1.6 percent compared 
with a rise of 2.6 percent in the first quarte r and of 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  
Large revisions to GDP going back almost two years also changed the outlook for household balance sheets.  The household savings rate is now thought to have hit a record 
low in 2004 as consumption was revised up and income was revised down in the first half 
of the year.    Early indicators for the thir d quarter indicate a slight improvement over second quarter 
activity.  After falling throughout the s econd quarter, business confidence rebounded 
strongly in July.  Consumer confidence also improved slightly in July.  The purchasing 
managers’ index for manufacturing in July retain ed most of June’s strong gains, and the 
PMI for services edged higher in July.

Month-to-month house price growth continues to  be just a bit above zero on average.  
According to the Nationwide Building Societ y index of house prices , the twelve-month 
change of house prices was 2.7 percent in July.  Household net borrowing for house 
purchase was stable in June at ₤11.5 billion. 
 Inflationary pressures seem to have picked  up a bit recently.  The twelve-month rate of 
consumer price inflation reached the Bank of  England’s 2 percent target in June.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation excl uding energy has risen considerably since 
early in the year, rising from 1.2 percent in  January to 1.6 percent in June.  Producer 
input price inflation has also risen, reaching 12 percent on a tw elve-month basis in June.   
 In Canada, incoming data for the second quarter suggest continued improvement in 
economic activity.  In May, GDP by industr y advanced 3.6 percent (a.r.), led by 
expansions in the utilities, energy, and oil ex traction sectors.  Manuf acturing activity also 
grew, although more slowly th an overall output.  Retail activity contracted in May, but 
this followed outsized gains during th e first four months of the year.

Other indicators for the second quarter were mixed.  Housing starts turned up again in 
June after a May lull; overal l, though slowing a bit compar ed to 2004, the housing sector 
continued to see elevated ac tivity in the first half of 2005.  The composite index of 
leading indicators continued its recent solid advance in June.  Retail sales turned down in 
May, following very strong advances the prev ious several months.  The manufacturing 
sector, after a bit of a pickup on balance the previous few mo nths, seemed to stall again 
in May, with shipments flat and new orders down.    
 The solid employment gains of the previous fe w months continued in June, with even the 
beleaguered manufacturing s ector adding jobs.  The une mployment rate edged down 
again, to 6.7 percent, matching a 30-year low also reached in mid-2000.  In June, the twelve-month rate of co nsumer price inflation was 1.7 percent , while the 
twelve-month rate of core inflation, excludi ng the eight most volatile components, came 
in at 1.5 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Indicators of economic activity across the developing economies have been mixed.  In 
Asia, a slowdown in Chinese growth in the second quarter was offset by acceleration in 
Korea and a rebound in Singapore.  In Latin Amer ica, growth continue s at about its prior 
rate.  With few exceptions, incoming inflation figures have surprised on the downside, perhaps reflecting little pass-th rough to date of higher crude  oil prices into regulated 
domestic energy prices across the developing countries and tighter monetary policy in 
Latin America.  The staff estimates that real GDP growth in China  slowed to 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the 
second quarter, based on the published four-quart er change of 9½ percent.  The staff’s 
GDP growth estimate is consistent with indi cators for investment growth which were 
lower in the second quarter, after a spike in the first quarter.  Export growth and 
consumer spending remained quite strong.  With import growth slumping, the trade surplus soared, exceeding an annual rate of  $100 billion in the second quarter.  Four-
quarter consumer price inflation was just 1.7 percent, almost ha lf of its first-quarter pace, 
partially reflecting declines in food prices.  Holdings of foreign exchange reserves 
exceeded $700 billion in June, but the pace of accumulation slowed from the first quarter.  
On July 22, China revalued the renminbi by about 2 percent ag ainst the dollar and 
announced it is moving to a managed float of the renminbi against an undisclosed basket 
of currencies.  There has been considerable attention paid to bids by Chinese companies 
to purchase U.S. companies over the past few months.  One of the most prominent bids, 
CNOOC's bid for Unocal, was dropped by CNOOC recently, citing U.S. political 
opposition.

Recent economic news out of Hong Kong  has been generally positive.  In the second 
quarter, unemployment fell to 5.7 percent and trade volumes, a good indicator of growth 
in the entrepôt economy, rose to new highs .  In part reflecting higher food prices, 
12-month consumer price inflation increased to  1.2 percent in June, the highest reading 
since 1998.

Indicators from Taiwan  suggest that growth strength ened in the second quarter.  
Industrial production rose 1 per cent, after dipping slightly in the first quarter, and the 
trade surplus widened a bit.  Unemployment  remained low.  Four-quarter headline 
consumer price inflation moved up in the second quarter, but ex cluding food and energy 
it was about zero.

Indicators for Korea  have shown considerable stre ngth since the June Greenbook.  GDP 
growth jumped to 5 percent in the sec ond quarter, due entirely to robust domestic 
demand.  Following the GDP release, the Ko rean government announced that it was 
withdrawing plans to introduce a fiscal stimulus plan for later this year.  Industrial 
production rose almost 2½ percent in June , boosted by strong consumer demand for 
durables.  Recent sales and confidence surveys remained elevated.  Signs of a stepdown 
in export growth are mounting, however.  The current account surplus for the second 
quarter was less than half of that registered in the previous quarter.  Consumer prices 
have decelerated in recent months and th e unemployment rate ticked up in June.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries suggest that ec onomic activity picked up in 
the second quarter.  In Singapore, the unoffici al advance estimate of  second-quarter real 
GDP indicates a surge of over 12 percent.  Elsewhere in the regi on, industrial production 
in recent months was up from the first-qua rter level on average in Philippines and 
Thailand, but was down in Malaysia.  Trade data show the ASEAN economies continue 
to run trade surpluses on average.  The ex ceptions are the Philippi nes and Thailand.  In 
Thailand, the trade deficit con tinued to widen because highe r oil prices increased the 
nominal import bill.  Aside from Singapore, headline consumer price inflation remained elevated across the 
region, reflecting higher food and energy prices .  Citing concerns over inflation, some 
countries have tightened monetary policy recen tly.  In mid-July, the Philippine central 
bank increased the reserve requirement 2 perc entage points, and the Thai central bank 
raised its key interest rate 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.  In Indonesia, the central bank 
authorities introduced a new one-m onth target interest rate, in itially set a bit higher than 
market-determined rates, in  line with their simultaneous  announcement of a “tight-
biased” monetary policy for the remainder of the year. 
 In the Philippines, the political situation has deteriorated following allegations that 
President Arroyo was involved in electoral fraud.   Partly reflecting th e political situation, 
Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch downgr aded their debt rating outlooks for the 
Philippines from stable to negative.

On July 22, Malaysia changed it s seven-year-old exchange ra te regime from a dollar peg 
to a managed float following China’s excha nge-rate announcement.  The central bank 
statement indicated that the objective will be to maintain a stable currency around its “fair 
value” against a trade-weighted index of trading partners’ currencies.  Since the 
announcement and through the end of July, the ringgit has appreciated nearly 1.3 percent.

In India , recent indicators have remained positiv e.  GDP rose 6.4 percent in the first 
quarter, boosted by robust consumer demand, and average industrial production in the 
first two months of the second quarter was 2½ percent above the fi rst-quarter level.  
Consumer prices decelerate d throughout the second quarter , although the effect of the 
partial lifting of fuel subsidies in mid-June has yet to  show through.  The trade deficit 
continued to widen in the second qu arter, reflecting surging imports.

In Mexico , recent data releases point to a mode rate pickup in economic activity from a 
weak performance in the first quarter.  Indus trial production was held down in March and 
April by sluggish U.S. demand for Mexican  manufacturing exports, but rose almost 
1 percent at a monthly rate in May and was up 3 percent from a year ago.  Similarly, the 
country’s index of economic activity (a mont hly proxy of real GDP) rose at a monthly 
rate of 0.8 percent in May and is  up 3.4 percent from a year ea rlier, mainly on the back of 
solid performance in the services sector.  In  addition, data for reta il sales and investment 
(not shown) suggest that do mestic demand has remained relatively unaffected by high 
real interest rates.  Mexico’s inflation outlook has improved in re cent months.  After tightening monetary 
policy a dozen times since early last year, th e Bank of Mexico has not changed its policy 
over the last four months, in line with recen t statements suggesting that its tightening 
cycle is over.  The rate on 28-day peso-de nominated bills has been stable at about 
9.6 percent for the past month, up almost 5 pe rcentage points since the tightening began.  
In June, twelve-month consumer inflation wa s 4.3 percent, down from the 5.2 percent 
registered last year, and within  striking distance of the 4 pe rcent upper limit of the central 
bank’s target range.  Core inflation was ev en lower at 3.4 percent in June and has 
continued trending down.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook have been generally positive.  Industrial 
production jumped in May, raising the April- May average 1¼ percent above its first-
quarter level.  Unemployment declined in  May to below 10 pe rcent and moved down 
further in June, partly reflec ting exits from the workforce.  With data available only 
through May, retail sales appear to have incr eased slightly in the second quarter.  
However, both consumer and business confiden ce declined in the second quarter.  The 
external sector remains a bri ght spot, with nominal exports  registering strong growth.  
Headline consumer prices were about unc hanged in June, bringing down the twelve-
month inflation rate to 7.3 per cent.  Part of this decline re flects a fall in food prices and 
the fact that Petrobras, the government oil firm, has not raised domestic prices of 
important fuels so far this year.  However, taken together with a decrease in wholesale 
price inflation in May and June, it may signa l that the sizeable appreciation of the real in 
recent months is finally passing through.   In June and July, the Brazilian central bank kept its policy rate, the Selic, on hold at 
19¾ percent.  In the minutes to the July m eeting, the central bank e xpressed concern that 
core inflation measures remain too high to be compatible with the inflation target.  
Political scandals continue to make headlines, as memb ers of the parties supporting 
President Lula have been accused of being bribed for their support for the administration’s legislation.  Although initiall y the impact appeared to be limited, it is 
now beginning to affect the Presiden t’s popularity and financial markets.

The economic recovery in Argentina  appears to be maturing.  The unemployment rate 
has fallen relatively steadily to about half of its level at the pe ak of the crisis.  In the first 
quarter, real GDP rose at an annual rate of just 2 percent as construction took a respite 
from its earlier heady pace of expansion.  In  the second quarter, i ndustrial production rose 
1.5 percent, about the same rate as in the first quarter, despite reports of energy shortages.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation was over 9 percent in Jul y, partly reflecting a 
jump in food prices earlier in the year.  Inflation remains above the upper end of the 
central bank’s unofficial targ et range of 5-8 percent fo r 2005, but under the government’s 
unofficial upper bound of 10.5 percent.  Since the completion of the debt swap, Ar gentina has held several successful local 
auctions for long-term bonds.  In face valu e terms, the government has placed $3 billion 
of inflation-indexed peso-denominated bonds.  Foreign participation in these auctions has 
reportedly been significant.  Subsequentl y, Argentina announced it will no longer auction 
inflation-indexed peso-denominated bonds, pr eferring instead dolla r-denominated bonds.  
In the latest auction, dollar-denominated bonds with a face value of almost $0.5 billion 
were placed.  Another $0.5 billion was so ld to the Venezuelan government in an 
off-market transaction.  However, Argentin a’s eventual access to international capital 
markets will largely depend on the outcome of  ongoing negotiations wi th the IMF over a 
new program.

In Venezuela , preliminary estimates point  to real GDP growth of 25 percent (a.r.) in the 
first quarter, supported by oil revenue-financed government spending.  Inflation eased a 
bit in the second quarter, but remains hi gh, boosted by the March devaluation of the 
bolivar as well as by expansionary fiscal po licies.  Oil production remains constrained by 
numerous problems at the government oil firm  and the government’s continued hostility 
toward private investors.  In  addition, profits from the stat e-owned firm are being used 
for social programs rather than maintenan ce and investment, raising concerns about 
future production.  In July, President Chavez succeeded in amending the central bank law 
so that the state oil company is no longer obligated to sell its dollar inflows to the central 
bank.  Moreover, the central bank was forced to make a one-time transfer of $6 billion 
out of its nearly $29 billion of international reserves to a ne w fund that can potentially be 
tapped to pay for imports, to invest in social or infrastructure projects with high import 
content, or to service external  debt.  Some portion of future oil revenues is also expected 
to be added to the fund, thus increasing Ch avez’s ability to fund social programs.
