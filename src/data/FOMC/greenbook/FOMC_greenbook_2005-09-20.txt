II-1                                                 Overview 
On August 29, Hurricane Katrina struck th e Gulf Coast.  Clearly, the economic 
dislocation in that region has been enormous.  For example, press reports indicate that an 
unprecedented number of initial claims for unemp loyment insurance have been filed in 
the Gulf states.  Anecdotal information and the very few hard statistical indicators of 
macroeconomic conditions outside the Gulf stat es have been mixed but do not point to a 
significant curtailment in overall activity at l east thus far.  Automobile industry analysts 
expect sales to fall in September, but the anticipated drop is pr obably just a further 
undoing of the discount-induced surge in July.  Reports from chain stores do not point to 
any sharp break in sales since the storm.  In addition, a substantial dose of fiscal stimulus, 
some of which will have an immediate effect, has been appropriated.  
 
Before the storm, economic activity appeared to have been on a solid trajectory.  The 
August labor market report showed another moderate increase in payroll employment, 
and other indicators suggested further gain s in production and sale s over the July-August 
period.  Housing activity remained strong through the summer.  Consumer spending seems to have exhibited considerable vigor in the face of rapidly rising energy prices.  
Business investment, however, appeared to ha ve lost a bit of steam, as orders and 
shipments were again on the soft side in July.  Core price inflation remained in check through July.  However, consumer energy co sts had risen dramatically even before 
Hurricane Katrina hit; they rose further in the wake of the storm and have retraced only a 
portion of that rise.  
 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand continued to expand at a moderate pace through mid-August.1  Private 
nonfarm payrolls rose 154,000 last month, and the level of employment in July was 
revised up slightly.  The average increase over the three months ending in August was 
174,000, a rate on par with the gains seen sinc e the fourth quarter of last year.  
Employment increases were widespread am ong industries last month, with construction 
posting a noticeable advance.  Among the weak er performers, hiring at wholesalers and 
providers of temporary help services wa s quite modest, while manufacturing jobs 
continued to trend down.  The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers was unchanged in August, at 33.7 hour s, and aggregate hours in this category 
rose 0.1 percent, to a level ½ percent (not an annual rate) above the average level in the second quarter.   
 
The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level since August 2001, and the labor force participation rate edged up further, to 66.2 percent.  The  
 
1 Because Hurricane Katrin a reached the Gulf Coast two weeks after the reference week for the August 
employment report, the August figures were not affected.  In 2004, 1.8 million persons were on nonfarm 
payrolls in the counties in Alabama, Louisiana, and Missi ssippi that were hit the hardest by the storm, equal 
to a bit less than 1½ percent of total employment.  This area also accounts for about 1½ percent of the 
nation’s housing units, 1½ percent of retail sales, an d nearly 2 percent of manufacturers’ shipments.

higher participation rate and lower unemployment rate combined to raise the 
employment-population ratio to 62.9 percent—th e highest reading in three years.  All 
told, these figures suggest that some slack  remains in the labor market, but that it 
continues to diminish gradually. 
 
The first reading on initial claims for unemplo yment insurance in th e post-Katrina period 
showed that filings were near ly unchanged in the week ending September 3.  The Bureau 
of Labor Statistics estima tes that about 10,000 individuals  reported disaster-related 
claims in that week, both in the hurricane- affected states and in neighboring states 
housing evacuees.  However, despite these filings, Louisiana and Mississippi reported 
low numbers of claims, likely because claims offices were closed and because individuals 
were evacuating and unable to file.   
 
The August readings for other labor market  indicators were mixed but generally 
consistent with a gradual improvement in cu rrent labor market conditions; they contained 
no signs of widespread tightness.  On th e one hand, layoff announcements fell back in 
August to their lowest level si nce April after having jumped in early summer.  Likewise, 
the share of firms reporting to the National Federation of Independent Businesses that 
they had a hard-to-fill position moved up last month to its highest level since February, 
although it remained well below the elevated leve ls seen in the late 1990s.  On the other 
hand, the job opening rate (as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover 
Survey) has not changed much this year afte r having risen appreciably in 2004, while the 
Help Wanted Index has remained at the low levels that have been evident throughout the 
expansion.  Alternative measures of households’ perceptions of j ob prospects are also 
sending conflicting signals:  While the Conf erence Board’s measure of job availability 
has edged up in recent months, the downward movement of late in the number of job 
leavers in the household survey who had b een unemployed less than five weeks as a 
percentage of household employment suggests that workers have become less willing to leave a job before finding another.  
 
Among the more forward-looking indicators, th e hiring plans of small businesses popped 
up in August, although the three-month movi ng average remained below the levels 
around the start of the year.  At the same time, net hiring plans of participants in the Manpower survey remained at the positive le vel that has been reported since the middle 
of 2004.  Household expectations of the labo r market as measured by the Conference 
Board have been flat since May, while the r ecent results from the Michigan Survey point 
to some deterioration. 
 
Industrial Production  
Total industrial production eked out a gain of 0.1 percent in  August even though 
Hurricane Katrina sharply curtailed production in the Gulf Coast region during the last 
three days of the month.  Manufacturing output  climbed 0.3 percent, mainly because of 
higher production of motor vehicles and parts.  The output of mines decreased 
0.6 percent, and the output of utilities fell 0.5 percent.

Although the exact magnitude of the effect of the hurricane on total IP is difficult to 
determine, we estimate that the change in total IP in August was likely reduced about 
0.3 percentage point.  So far in September,  the disruptions in the Gulf region have 
continued to restrain IP significantly, although many of th e affected industries have 
already made substantial progr ess toward recovery.  In pa rticular, whereas more than 
95 percent of Gulf Coast oil production and about 90 percent of Gulf Coast natural gas 
extraction were shut down on August 30, the De partment of the In terior’s Minerals 
Management Service estimates that only  56 percent of crude oil production and 
37 percent of natural gas extraction in the Gulf  remained shut-in as of September 13.  In 
addition, the Department of Energy reports that the number of shut-down refineries has 
fallen from nine immediately after the storm to  five currently, and the number that were 
operating at reduced rates has fa llen sharply as well.  Nonethel ess, utilization rates in the 
petroleum refining industry were high before th e hurricane hit; thus, the industry’s ability 
to make up lost production will be limited ev en after all refineries are again fully 
operational. 
 
Outside the energy sector, Ka trina has restrain ed production in basic chemicals, 
shipbuilding, food processing, fertilizer, pul p and papermills, nonferrous foundries, and 
fabricated structural steel; all of these industries have a sizab le share of factory shipments 
that originate in the affected area.  Although flooding, power outages, and damaged 
infrastructure continue to impair the ability  of some plants to ramp up production, others 
have restored production near ly to pre-hurricane levels.2  
 
Elsewhere, motor vehicle production rebounde d 400,000 units in August to an annual rate 
of 12.2 million units, and industry schedules suggest that assemblies will continue at about that pace in September.  Accordingly, the production of motor vehicles and parts directly contributed about ¼ percentage point to the change in tota l IP in August and will 
likely be a neutral influence in September.  Inventories of light vehicles were little 
changed in August after having fallen sharply in July and were equi valent to sixty-one 
days’ supply at the end of the month when ev aluated at the August sales pace.  Initial 
assembly plans for the fourth quarter call for production to tota l an annual rate of 
12.1 million units. 
 
The IP index for commercial aircraft rose  further in August after posting robust gains 
throughout most of this year.  However, Boei ng’s machinists union initiated a strike on 
September 2 that led the company to cease production of all commercial aircraft.3  
Industry analysts anticipate  that it will continue for more than a month.   
                                                 
2 For example, according to Chemical Market Asso ciates, Inc. (CMAI) all ten chlorine production 
facilities in the affected region—rep resenting about 27 percent of domestic capacity—are now producing, 
whereas six of the ten were offline on September 6. 
3 Output in the commercial aircraft industry, of which Boeing represents more than 90 percent, 
currently accounts for 0.8 percent of total industrial production.

In the high-tech sector, the pace of production has picked up somewhat in recent months 
after having slowed in the second quarter.  In August,  high-tech output moved up 
1.5 percent after an in crease of 2.3 percent in July.  Th e recent acceleration has been 
driven by communications equipment a nd semiconductors.  Production gains for 
computers continue to average about 1 perc ent per month, well below the average pace in 
the latter half of the 1990s.    
 
Industry reports paint a favorable picture of  the near-term prospects for communications 
equipment and semiconductors.  Our contac t at Cisco was decidedly upbeat about 
business conditions in the near term, citi ng continued strong replacement demand.  In 
addition, the CIO Magazine  diffusion index of future spending for data networking 
equipment moved up again in August (although the index for future spending on computer hardware fell back after having s purted up in July).  As for semiconductors, 
Intel’s mid-quarter update to its  revenue guidance for the third quarter is consistent with 
the accelerating production of microprocessors and flash memory.  However, in the 
computer industry, the latest outlook from Ga rtner suggests that unit sales of personal 
computers have slowed in the third quarter. 
 
Outside of transportation, high-tech, and energy, production was uneven in August.  The 
output of defense and space equipment continued to trend upward.  In contrast, the production of consumer goods decreased 0.4 per cent in August, a decline driven by a

drop in the production of nondurable consumer  goods; a dropback in the production of 
farm machinery, which had spiked in July, pulled down the index for business equipment.  
Among upstream market groups, the output of construction supplies rose 0.7 percent in 
August.  The output of materials designated fo r further processing in the industrial sector 
was unchanged in August and has moved down, on balance, from its year-ago level.  Within this group, however, the production of  iron and steel jumped 4.3 percent in 
August after having been restrain ed earlier in the year while steel service centers worked 
off excess inventories. 
 
The forward-looking indicators of  industrial activity were mixed in August but generally 
remained consistent with modest near -term gains.  The Institute for Supply 
Management’s new orders diffusion index decreased in August but remained above 50 for the twenty-eighth consecutive month.  Although the new orders  diffusion index from 
the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey pl unged in August, the Philadelphia Fed’s new-
orders diffusion index moved up solidly, and most other regional indexes continue to 
point to near-term production increases.  Th e three-month moving av erage of the staff’s 
series on real adjusted durabl e goods orders ticked up in July. 
 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles fell to an annual  rate of 16.7 million units in August—well below 
the near-record pace of 20.7 m illion units in July but roughly in line with the average 
pace for the first half of the year.  According to confidentia l data, a jump in fleet sales 
helped to support total sales in August in the face of a steep plunge in retail sales, which 
covers both consumer purchases and leases.  The weakness in the retail segment may 
have reflected in part the limited availability of some GM models as  well as the payback 
that typically follows a surge in sales.  The automakers have informed us on a confidential basis that they expect light vehicl e sales to fall in a range of 15¼ million to 
16½ million units in September. 
 
Although the employee discounts were  initially scheduled to e xpire at the end of July, 
they have been extended a few times and are now set to expire on October 3 (September 
30 at GM).  GM has added its 2006 model-year  large SUVs and full-sized pickups to the 
promotion, although the cash-back  incentives offered on these models are smaller than 
those on the 2005 models.4  Ford had included some 2006 models in its employee-
discount program in July and August but limited the promotion to 2005 models in September.  Employee pricing at Chrysl er applies only to 2005 models.  The 
manufacturers have continued to partially o ffset the employee discounts by scaling back 
their cash rebates and reduced-r ate financing offers.  Indeed, the average value of  
                                                 
4Both GM and Ford have been struggling to shore up the sales of large and mid-sized SUVs, which 
have been slipping all year as a result of not only hi gh gasoline prices but also the aging line-up of the 
companies’ models in this market segment.  GM plans to redesign some of its large SUVs and pickups over 
the winter shutdown and to debut its 2007 models in early 2006.  Even with the redesigns, recent 
statements by GM official s indicate that the automaker is scaling back its outlook for SUV sales in the 
coming years.

incentives per light vehicle sold, which ex cludes the employee-discount programs, fell 
$242 in August and stood nearly $600 below the le vels that prevailed in the first half of 
the year.  Nevertheless, according to th e Michigan Survey for August (which was 
released on August 26), consumers continued to perceive that car prices are low and that 
car-buying conditions are favorable.  Surpri singly, only 8 percent of respondents at the 
time of the August survey cited high gaso line prices as a reason not to buy a car, 
compared with a high of 18 percent in April. 
   
Consumer Spending  
Real consumer spending rose briskly during the summer, the result of the surge in 
purchases of motor vehicles and moderate  increases in spending on other goods and 
services.  The combination of strong overall  spending growth and tepid gains in real 
income has put downward pressure on the saving  rate in recent months, and, according to 
the published data, it fell to negative 0.6 percent in July.5   
 
In the retail control cate gory of goods—which excludes sales by auto dealers and 
building material and supply stores—nomin al spending rose 1 percent in August.  
Factoring in our projection for consumer pr ices, we estimate that real spending on PCE 
goods excluding autos and trucks jumped near ly 1½ percent in June , was up a little in 
July, and rose 0.2 percent in August.  Real out lays for services rose 0.4 percent in June 
and 0.2 percent in July (the  latest available data).  
 
Real disposable income was unchanged in July after having risen at an annual rate of just 
2 percent in the second quarter.  The increa se in nominal wages and salaries in July 
outpaced the rise in prices, but other compone nts of income declined sharply in real 
terms.  Moreover, steep increases in energy prices will continue to damp real income 
gains in August and September.  The ratio of household wealth to income continued to 
inch up in the second quarter because of an in crease in stock prices and another jump in 
home prices.  The August reports on consumer  sentiment from the Michigan Survey and 
the Conference Board—which were completed before the hurricane struck the Gulf 
Coast—moved in opposite directions, but the leve ls of both series were consistent with 
solid increases in spending. 
 
Housing  
Residential construction continued at a r obust pace through midyear.  Starts of new 
single-family homes in July were at an a nnual rate of 1.71 million units, slightly above 
their average level in the first half of the year, while new permit issuance and the backlog 
of unused permits were at record levels.  In the multifamily sector, starts dipped to an annual rate of 331,000 units, but permits remained strong. 
 
                                                 
5 The BEA has apparently assumed that the share of new truck purchases going to consumers fell in 
July even though fleet, retail, and l ease data suggest that the consumers’  share likely incr eased.  Combining 
this with our expectation of an upward revision to spe nding based on the retail sales report, we estimate that 
the saving rate fell to negative 1 percent in July.

Home sales also remained elevated through Ju ly.  New home sales climbed 6½ percent to 
an annual rate of 1.41 million units.  Although inventories of new homes for sale have 
risen this year, the months’ supply (evaluated  at July’s sales pace) was still below the 
readings in the first half of the year and well short of historical norms.  Sales of existing 
single-family homes slipped 2½ percent in July from the record-setting level in June, but 
they remained at a lofty annual rate of 6.24 million units.  Inventories of existing homes 
moved up further and equaled 4.6 months’ supp ly at July’s pace —at the high end of 
recent readings but a good bit below the historical average.  
 
Demand for housing continues to be supporte d by low long-term mortgage rates—the 
thirty-year fixed rate is still hovering around 5¾ pe rcent, as it has since late last year.  
Rates for one-year adjustable-rate mortgage s have increased roughly 30 basis points so 
far this year but have stayed well below their levels of a few years ago.   Most near-term 
indicators of sales activity—such as the i ndex of mortgage app lications for purchase 
through early September and the July pe nding home sales index—remained at high 
levels.  In contrast, the inde x of builders’ ratings for new home sales slipped noticeably in 
August and was at the lower end of readings registered over recent years; however, this 
index has not tracked home sales or construc tion very closely in the past six years. 
 
Prices of existing homes continued to increa se rapidly during the first half of 2005, while 
the rate of price appreciati on for new homes moderated so mewhat.  The purchase-only 
version of the OFHEO price index, which cont rols for differences in quality by tracking 
repeat sales of the same houses over time, was 11 percent higher in the second quarter 
than it had been a year earlier.   The constant-quality price index for new homes—which controls for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, and other readily measurable attributes—was up 6¾ percent in the second quarter from its year-ago level, at the lower end of the range of the past year  and a half.  The average price of new homes 
decelerated markedly over the summer; some of the slowing was likely the result of a 
compositional shift. 
 
Equipment and Software 
Although real outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the second quarter, business spending does not appear to have had much forward momentum at midyear.  The softness in shipments and orders  in July implies a less rosy near-term 
outlook than seemed likely a month ago, even though the fundamentals still appear quite positive.  In particular, business output cont inues to expand at a rapid clip, financing 
conditions remain favorable, and firms still hold large stocks of liquid assets.  Furthermore, for the most part, anecdotal reports and business surveys provide ongoing 
evidence of business optimism, although c oncerns about energy-related costs are 
increasing (as reported in the late st reading of the ISM survey). 
 
In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computers edged up 0.5 percent in July 
after two months of declines.  Although falling prices imply that real  purchases continue 
to rise, the increase in real out lays on computers and peripherals this quarter is likely to 
fall far short of the nearly 40 percent annual ra te that was registere d, on average, in the

first half of the year.  In contrast, orders and shipment s of communications equipment 
have been running at reasonably high levels since May and point to a sizable gain in real 
outlays in this category in the current quarter. 
 
In the transportation sector, business spending on new mo tor vehicles was brisk over the 
summer.  Fleet sales rose sharply in August, in part perhaps because the manufacturers 
accelerated some deliveries to businesses in the face of soft retail demand.  Sales of 
medium and heavy trucks were robust in Ju ly and August after having weakened a bit 
earlier in the year, and new orders for these vehicles stayed high.  Demand for trucks is 
likely to remain elevated into 2006, as some customers will likely try to buy ahead of the new EPA regulations on truck engines that w ill take effect in January 2007.  Elsewhere, 
business spending on aircraft continued to be  restrained by excess capacity in the U.S. 
airline industry and stratospheric fuel costs. 
 
Investment spending on non-hi gh-tech, nontransportation eq uipment edged down in the 
second quarter, and the incoming data suggest that  the softness persisted into the summer.   
Nominal shipments in this broad category fell 0.5 percent in July after having been essentially flat over the preceding few months, and orders decreased in July as well.  Some of this softness appears to be rela ted to the second-quarter slowdown in the 
manufacturing sector—the primary customer for this type of equipment.  However, order 
backlogs have continued to rise, suggesting that shipments should turn back up in coming 
months. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Conditions in nonresidential property markets ha ve improved incrementally this year, but 
real spending on nonresidential structures has yet to gain traction.  The vacancy rate for 
office buildings drifted down during the tw o years ending in the second quarter of 2005, 
but construction in this sector  was about flat through July.  Real spending on commercial 
buildings has also been moving sideways desp ite the continued low vacancy rate in this 
sector.  In addition, real c onstruction outlays in the manu facturing sector have been 
sluggish recently after having in creased late last year.   
 
Outlays on drilling and mining structures moved up sharply in the second quarter.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas continued to climb over the summer and, according to initial estimates from Baker Hughes, remained high th rough early September.  After 
some weakness last spring, the number of rigs  drilling for crude oil also rose over the 
summer and is estimated to have held fairly  steady post-Katrina.  The Baker Hughes data, 
however, consider rigs to be operating unless they are officia lly confirmed to be lost or 
significantly damaged; thus, they may not yet fully reflect hurricane -related disruptions. 
 
Business Inventories  
Investment in real nonfarm inventories exclud ing motor vehicles slowed markedly in the 
second quarter, and partial data suggest that real stockbuilding rema ined subdued in July. 
The book value of manufacturing stocks rose at an annual rate of $28 billion in July, 
compared with an increase of just $1 billion in the second quarter.  However, much of the

July increase was in the petroleum sector and was likely related to the run-up in oil 
prices.  In the wholesale trade sector excl uding motor vehicles, inventories fell $4 billion 
at an annual rate in July after having posted a $12 billion gain in the second quarter.   
 
The slower rate of inventory investment that  emerged in the spring and appears to have 
continued into the summer suggests that firms have substantially completed the 
stockbuilding that seemed warranted  in light of the low ratios of inventories to sales that 
prevailed earlier.  Survey results from the ISM for August are supportive of that view.  
Information from the staff’s flow-of-goods i nventory system for July also indicates 
that—with the exceptions of paper and, to a lesser degree, food—inventories were well 
aligned with consumption. 
 
Federal Government Sector  
The Monthly Treasury Statements for July and August were broadly consistent with the 
summer budget projections from the Congressi onal Budget Office (CBO) and the Office 
of Management and Budget (O MB); these projections indicat ed that the unified deficit 
for fiscal 2005 would be in the area of $330 billion to $335 billion.  The President has 
signed into law two bills containing a combin ed $62 billion for hurricane relief.  These 
emergency appropriations are not expected to have much effect on the deficit in fiscal 
2005, which ends on September 30, but will a dd significantly to the deficit in 2006.  
 
In the July-August period, unified federal tax receipts were about 9 percent above their 
year-earlier level.  Most of this increase reflects growth in wage s and salaries and the 
associated bracket creep.  Outlays in the July-August period were roughly 5 percent 
above their year-earlier leve l, with especially large increases for Medicare and 
agriculture.  Defense spending was 6 percent above its year-e arlier level, about in line 
with its recent trend. 
 
The CBO released its midyear budget update  on August 15.  As expected, the CBO 
revised down its estimate of the baseline deficit for fiscal 2005.  Although the CBO 
projected larger baseline defi cits over fiscal 2006-15 in August than it did in March, the 
revision largely reflected the incorporation of the supplemental a ppropriations enacted 
during the spring and the statut ory requirement that the CBO  extrapolate forward that 
additional spending.  Otherwise, the CBO’s outlook for the baselin e budget over the next 
few years was a little better than it ha d appeared in March, while the underlying budget 
picture for subsequent years was little ch anged.  The petering out of the near-term 
improvement in the budget reflected the CBO ’s assessment that the recent positive tax 
surprise was largely the result of transitory factors.       
 
In early September, the President signed an emergency supplemental appropriation of 
$10.5 billion to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.   A few days later,  a second bill totaling 
$52 billion in aid was enacted.  In terms of  regular appropriations for fiscal 2006, the 
President has signed only two of the twelve standard appropriations bills; however, the Congress has made considerable progress on the remaining bills, s uggesting that their 
enactment will not likely drag on long in the new fiscal year.

State and Local Government Sector  
Indicators of state and local activity have been mixed in r ecent months.  After having 
climbed for four months, nominal constructi on put-in-place fell in June and July to a 
level 1 percent below the second-quarter aver age.  Much of the weakness was in the 
education and highway components, each of which accounts for almost 30 percent of the 
sector’s construction.  Meanwhile, state a nd local employment rose 16,000 in August 
after a 42,000 gain in July.   
 
The National Conference of State Legislatures has released its annual report on the fiscal 
status of state governments.6  Roughly two-thirds of the states reported that their general 
fund balances plus rainy day funds at the e nd of fiscal 2005 were equal to more than 
5 percent of general fund expe nditures—the level that many analysts view as sufficient 
when evaluating a state’s fiscal condition.  These results are a good deal better than the 
states had anticipated a year earlier when they first fo rmulated their 2005 budgets.  Much 
of the improvement was the result of higher revenues than originally projected.  Some states used the unanticipated revenues for supplemental appropriations, and some 
deposited them into their rainy day funds  or left them in their general funds. 
                                                 
6 Data were collected from forty-si x states for fiscal 2005, which ended on June 30 in most states.

Prices 
Core consumer price inflation has remained moderate, with the core PCE price index up 
0.1 percent in July and just 1.2 percent at an annual rate over the three months ending in 
July.  However, a surge in energy prices has pushed up overall consumer price inflation 
considerably.  PCE energy prices jumped 4.0 percent in July, and survey evidence on 
gasoline prices points to enormous increases over the August–September period.  Over the twelve months ending in July, overall PCE prices rose 2.5 percen t, and the year-over-
year change is likely to rise going forward. 
 
The PCE price index for energy rose 15 percent during the year ending in July, nearly the 
same as the increase posted over the year ending in July 2004.  Energy prices were on 
track for a further large increase in August even prior to Hurrican e Katrina.  Gasoline 
prices were rising especially rapidly, reflecting both the ongoi ng rise in crude oil prices 
and a sharp run-up in margins that came about as  a fire at one refinery and the closing of 
others for maintenance cut production and le d to a sharp drawdown in inventories.  
Gasoline prices rose further in the wake  of the hurricane; indeed, the Oil Price 
Information Service reports that retail regul ar gasoline prices peaked on September 2 at 
$3.04 per gallon—44 cents higher than on August 26 (before Katrina struck).  They have 
since declined about 11 cents per gallon, and al though gasoline inventories have fallen to 
historically low levels, pre ssure on prices should ease a b it further in coming weeks as 
more domestic production is restored and additional imports of gasoline arrive.  
Nevertheless, survey data in hand suggest th at the gasoline component of the CPI will 
have risen 8 percent in August and is likely to rise at roughly twice that rate in 
September.  Futures quotes, which have dr opped since peaking on September 1, point to 
declines in gasoline prices in Novemb er and December—but, seasonally adjusted, 
gasoline margins are not expected to retu rn to their pre-hur ricane levels.   
 
Natural gas prices have also moved up sharpl y in recent weeks as some industrial users 
have substituted away from refined products and as production has been restrained by 
damage to facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.  In contrast to the situation for gasoline, 
inventories of natural gas were  at comfortable levels prio r to the hurricane and remain 
sufficient for the time being, and onshore natura l gas pipelines in the path of Katrina 
appear to have survived with little damage.  However, a si gnificant amount of natural gas 
production remains offline, and several natural ga s processing plants in  Louisiana are still 
shut down.  Recent natural gas futures prices suggest that production losses may keep natural gas prices high through the coming winter. 
 
The food component of the PCE price index ro se 0.2 percent in July after having shown 
no change for the two preceding months.  Duri ng the twelve months ending in July, food 
prices rose 2 percent, well below their in crease during the preced ing year.  Expanding 
production of meats and poultry contributed to this slowdown, and increased supplies 
should continue to restrain increases in c onsumer food prices in the months ahead.  
Although growing conditions appeared mediocre earlier this year, recent field surveys of 
this year’s corn and soybean crops have been  positive.  Prices dipped a little in the

immediate aftermath of the hurricane, but th e declines were mostly retraced when it 
became clear that crop exporting facilities were relatively undamaged. 
 
Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index rose 0.1 percent in July after having 
been unchanged in June.  For the three months ending in July, core PC E prices rose at an 
annual rate of 1¼ percent, ½ percentage point  less than the increase in the preceding three 
months.  While inflation in core services has been fairly stable of late, price increases for 
core goods have slowed.  This slowdown par tly reflected a sizable drop in motor vehicle 
prices caused by the employee-discount  pricing programs among the Big Three 
automakers.  The discounts are expected to  be removed around the end of September, 
which should be reflected in the PCE price index in October and November.  During the 
twelve months ending in July, overall core PCE prices rose 1¾ pe rcent, a touch below 
their pace a year earlier. 
 
As measured by the Michigan Survey, shor t-run inflation expectations edged up to 
3.1 percent in August but remained a shade belo w the levels of last spring.  Median long-
run inflation expectations inched back down to 2.8 percent in August—a level near the center of the narrow range observed over the past few years.  
 
At earlier stages of processing, commodity prices have been mixed since the August 
Greenbook, with prices of metals and energy-related commodities increasing 
significantly but with prices of other commodities mostly d eclining.  Steel scrap prices 
have risen 63 percent in the past month and a half, back to the elevated levels seen during 
2004; according to trade reports, this increase reflects a slower flow of scrap steel into 
dealers’ yards as well as a pickup in export demand along the U.S. East and (prior to the hurricane) Gulf coasts.  The Journal of Co mmerce index of industrial commodities prices, 
which includes a substantial energy component , has jumped nearly 11 percent in recent 
weeks, while the Commodity Research Bur eau spot industrials index, which excludes 
energy items, has increased only 1¼ percent.  The considerable increases in prices for metal and energy commodities have not yet s hown through to intermediate goods.  In the 
producer price index, core intermediate ma terials edged down 0.1 percent in August, 
continuing the declines seen in each of the th ree previous months.  Over the past twelve 
months, core intermediate prices have risen 3¼ percent, a good bit less than the increase 
over the preceding year.   
 
Labor Costs 
The staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm busine ss sector increased 
at an annual rate of 4½ percen t in the second quarter.  Noneth eless, because of the faster 
increases reported during the pr eceding three quarters, the year-over-year increase in 
hourly compensation stood at 6½ percent in th e second quarter, and th e rise in unit labor 
costs was 4¼ percent—both mark a significant st ep-up from the pace of a year earlier.  
Contributing to that acceleration was the 10 percent (annual rate) surge in hourly 
compensation in the final quarter of last year.  Part of the end-of-year jump was 
apparently the result of a temporary burst  of bonuses and stock option exercises.  
However, the recent estimate of compensation for the first quarter, which reflects the

newly available employer unemployment insurance tax records, suggests that more of the 
surge could  be permanent than we had earlier reckoned.   
 
Other gauges of labor costs do not show a comparable pickup.  In particular, the 
Employment Cost Index (ECI) rose at an annua l rate of only 2½ percen t in the first half 
of the year.  The twelve-month change in  ECI compensation, which excludes stock 
options, was 3¼ percent in June—down from 4 percent a year earlier.  Over the past 
twelve months, average hourly earnings rose 2¾ percent, ju st ½ percentage point more 
than the increase posted over th e preceding twelve months.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Over the intermeeting period, market interest  rates dropped appreciably in response to 
Hurricane Katrina, rising en ergy prices, and some weaker -than-anticipated economic 
data.  Futures quotes indicate that market pa rticipants now attach  about a one-in-four 
chance to a pause in monetary tightening at  the September meeting and have marked 
down the expected path of the federal funds rate thereafter.   Nominal Treasury yields 
declined in line with these changed policy exp ectations.  TIPS yields fell notably as well, 
and the configuration of yields implies a rise  in inflation compensation for the next few 
years but no change further out.  Stock prices  edged higher, credit spreads on investment-
grade corporate bonds were little changed, and spreads for lower-tier bonds widened 
modestly.  Business debt con tinued to expand at a moderate  pace in August.  Household 
borrowing remained strong through the second quar ter, as low interest rates and another 
large increase in house prices continued to support robust growth of mortgage debt. 
 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The decision by the FOMC to raise the target  federal funds rate 25 basis points at the 
August meeting had been widely anticipated, as was the content of the accompanying 
statement.  Early in the intermeeting peri od, policy expectations for next spring and 
beyond drifted down in response to incoming data that ran on the soft side of 
expectations and concerns about  the effects of rising oil pr ices.  The devastation from 
Hurricane Katrina and the associated spike in  energy prices (especially for gasoline and 
other refined products) substant ially reduced near- and longe r-term policy expectations.  
Against the backdrop of these effects of Katrin a, expectations were scaled back further 
after the release of the August FOMC minutes, as market par ticipants reportedly focused 
on the Committee’s view that “elevated energy prices were seen as likely to be a 
significant drag on consumption.”  More recentl y, the expected policy path has reversed 
some of the earlier decline, as the wors t-case scenarios about damages to industrial 
infrastructure from Hurricane Katrina have not  materialized, prices of oil and gasoline 
have fallen back, and speeches by Federal Rese rve officials have mentioned the need for 
continued vigilance against inflation.  J udging from federal funds  futures, investors 
currently place about a one-in-four chance on a pause in monetary tightening at the 
September meeting and expect a federal funds ra te slightly below 4 percent in the middle 
of next year—down 30 basis points sin ce the August meeting—with virtually no 
additional tightening later.  Un certainty about the future path  of policy rose significantly 
over this period, mainly af ter the hurricane.

III-3 
Treasury yields fell 25 to 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, largely on the 
revision in policy expectations.  Inflation co mpensation as derived from indexed nominal 
Treasury debt over the next five  years rose slightly amid rising energy prices.  However, 
inflation compensation over the subseque nt five years was little changed. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Overall, the response of stock prices to ec onomic data and hurricane-related news has 
been quite muted.  Broad equity index leve ls were up a bit over the intermeeting period, 
apparently supported by lower in terest rates, which helped offset concerns that rising 
energy prices might reduce economic growth.  Shares of Allstate, an insurer with 
significant exposure to losses in the Gulf Coast states, fell ab out 10 percent, but a broader 
index of domestic property and casualty insu rers was down only 2 percent.  Implied 
volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 remained low, readings consistent with 
a low level of perceived macroeconomic risk  in the near term.  The trend-adjusted 
twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio, a m easure of expected long-run real equity 
returns, remained near 5½ percent, where it has been hovering for several years.  The 
spread between this measure and the real pe rpetuity Treasury yield—a  rough gauge of the 
equity risk premium—widened a touch further.    Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fe ll nearly as much as those on comparable-
maturity Treasuries, and their spreads were up just a few basis points over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on speculative-g rade bonds were little changed, implying a 
modest rise in credit spreads.  Risk spreads on commercial paper remained low. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Aside from the notable disappointment of Wal- Mart’s quarterly report, the final batch of 
second-quarter earnings re ports—including those from many other retailers—brought 
predominantly good news to investors.  With essentially complete data on second-quarter 
earnings in hand, earnings per sh are for the S&P 500 are estimated to have grown nearly 
14 percent over the preceding year, a bit mo re than had been projected in the August 
Greenbook.  The BEA’s preliminary estimate of  second-quarter corporate profits also 
came in on the high side of the staff’s proj ection.  Reflecting the positive second-quarter 
news, analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead ear nings for S&P 500 firms were revised up about 
1 percent in mid-August.  Upward revisions were notable for firms in the energy sector. 
 
Credit quality of nonfinancial firms remained strong.  Corporate balance sheets continued 
to show relatively high levels of liquid a ssets, even after some drawdown in those

balances over the first half of the year.  Downgrades of corporate debt outpaced upgrades 
in July and August, but the bulk of downgraded  debt again came from the auto sector, as 
Moody’s further lowered their ratings on Ford a nd GM debt.  Both the realized six-month 
trailing bond default rate and the forecast of the aggregate year-ahead default rate based 
on KMV’s model have dropped to very low leve ls.  However, with two major airlines 
tottering on the brink of bankruptcy, a ri se in the default rate seems likely. 
 
Business Finance 
Nonfinancial firms continued to issue bonds in  August at the modera te pace of the past 
several months.  Speculative-grade issues accoun ted for about one-third of the proceeds.  
However, substantial retirements have kept net bond issuance tepid so far in the third 
quarter.  In contrast, bank loans continued to expand briskly during the first two months 
of this quarter and commercial paper rose so mewhat as well, leaving net debt financing 
near the moderate pace seen over the past year.  After a sluggish July, gross pub lic equity issuance pi cked up smartly in August, propelled 
by a surge in initial public offerings—twenty- two nonfinancial issues  from a variety of 
industries—which were, by and large, enthus iastically received.  New registrations 
continued apace, suggesting that IPO issuance will remain brisk this autumn so long as stock prices do not move lower.  At the same  time, secondary offerings remained scarce, 
likely reflecting the healthy stat e of corporate balance sheets. 
 Equity retirements, bolstered by strong prof its and ample cash positions, are estimated to 
have soared in the second quarter.  Share re purchases are set to hit a record once again, 
while completions of cash-financed mergers al so increased in the second quarter.  Early 
indications are that retirements will continue  to be elevated in the current quarter.  
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt rose  at an annual rate of near ly 14 percent in the second 
quarter, and recent issuance and the calenda r of offerings of commercial-mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) suggest continued strength in the third quarter.  Spreads on 
AAA-rated issues remain low, and, in recen t weeks, spreads on BBB-rated issues have 
partly retraced the run-up th at occurred earlier this year.  While some analysts have 
expressed concern about lower underwriti ng standards and a thinner buffer from 
subordinated tranches, the underlying market  fundamentals are solid.  Delinquency rates 
on commercial mortgages and CMBS have cont inued to trend down, and data on vacancy 
rates and rents point to a further recovery  in real estate market conditions.

Household Finance 
Growth of household debt cont inued at a brisk pace in the second quarter, again led by a 
substantial rise in mortgage debt.  Over th e year ending in the s econd quarter, mortgage 
debt increased 13 percent, a rise fueled by low mortgage rates and rapid house price 
appreciation.  Early and incomplete data in dicate continued robust mortgage borrowing in 
the third quarter.  The thirty -year fixed mortgage rate de clined over the intermeeting 
period to 5.7 percent, near the middle of the range seen over the past year.  In contrast to 
mortgage debt, consumer credit has continue d to expand only moderately, with the July 
figure just 4½ percent above its year-earlier level.  Grow th of overall household debt 
outpaced that of disposable income in the second quarter and caused the financial 
obligations ratio to edge up.    Although bankruptcy filings have increased over  the past few weeks, this upturn likely 
reflects the beginning of another surge in filin gs before mid-October, when the widely 
publicized bankruptcy reform le gislation that was passed last  spring takes effect.  Other 
data point to improving household credit qual ity conditions, with most delinquency rates 
remaining low or falling.    Large increases in home prices continued to boost household wealth  through the middle 
of this year.  OFHEO’s repeat-transactions house price index rose at  an annual rate of 
13½ percent in the second quarter.  The st rength in home price appreciation was 
distributed widely, with twen ty-five states experiencing doub le-digit percentage increases 
on a year-over-year basis.  The net rise in st ock prices over the past couple of months 
suggests that net worth is continuing to grow relative to income in th e current quarter.   
Net purchases of long-term mu tual fund shares remained fairly brisk in August, with 
flows tilted toward international e quity funds and high-grade bond funds. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Last month, the Congressional Budget Office lowe red its estimate of the fiscal year 2005 
federal budget deficit to about $331 billion from its March estim ate of $365 billion.  
Much of the reduction reflected higher tax reve nues.  The estimates were released before 
Hurricane Katrina, however, which has thus  far spurred more than $60 billion in 
appropriations.  Foreign official purchases of Treasuries do not appear to have changed substantially since 
China’s currency revaluation in July.  Indirect bidder partic ipation in Treasury auctions,

institutions, was below average in the five-y ear Treasury note auction that occurred the 
day after the August FOMC meeting but substant ially above average in auctions later in 
the intermeeting period.  An a lternative indicator of forei gn official demand—the value 
of Treasury securities held in  custody on behalf of foreign official institutions at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York—increased at  about the pace seen earlier in the year. 
 Over the intermeeting period, the stock prices  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell about 
12 percent and 6 percent, re spectively, partly because of announcements by Fannie Mae 
that it would miss deadlines for filing earnings  results with the SEC and by Freddie Mac 
that its 2005 first-half earni ngs were down 60 percent from a year earlier.  However, 
agency debt spreads rose only s lightly over the intermeeting period. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
In August, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds to finance capital projects 
continued at a robust pace, while issuance for advance refunding edged down from the 
exceptional rate seen earlier this year.  Short-term issuance of municipal bonds was 
bumped up in August by a single large deal.  The credit quality of municipal bonds held 
steady, with rating upgrades on municipal bonds just outpacing downgrades so far this 
year.  The ratio of municipal bond yields to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, an 
alternative measure of credit quality, was little changed on net after Hurricane Katrina.  
The rating agencies have put about $9 billion in obligations from po lities in the affected 
areas—a tiny fraction of the overall m unicipal market—on watch for possible 
downgrades as they wait for further information.  
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 growth picked up to a moderate 5 percen t pace in August.  Staff estimates suggest 
only a modest contribution to August growth from special factors, such as mortgage 
prepayments and foreign demand for U.S. dollars .  So far, reporting difficulties resulting 
from Hurricane Katrina have made money stoc k data only slightly more prone to later 
revisions.  Also, some temporary compos itional changes may occur if affected 
households shift into cash, as has happened after past natural disasters.   In the aggregate, 
though, effects on both data quality and the grow th of major components of M2 seem to 
have been quite small.  Growth of bank credit surged to an annual rate of 12½ per cent in August, with loans 
accounting for the bulk of the increase.  Gr owth in mortgage loans to households was 
very strong, and consumer credit expanded mode rately.  Lending to businesses, through 
III-16 
C&I loans and commercial mortgages, remained robust.  Loan growth in August was also 
boosted by a rebound in the volatile “other loans”  component.  As with M2, the hurricane 
may affect the accuracy of the bank credit da ta and bank credit growth going forward, but 
the effects are likely to be small in the aggregate.  Data from the August Survey of Terms of  Business Lending (STBL) indicate that the 
average spread of rates on C&I loans over Eu rodollar and swap yields adjusted for non-
price loan characteristics ro se 10 basis points from May, a gain driven mostly by an 
increase in the spread on high-risk loans a nd loans secured by collateral.  The adjusted 
STBL results are broadly consistent with recent movements in spreads on BB-rated 
syndicated loan tranches at banks, which have  also moved up from historical lows in 
recent months.

In July, the value of exports of goods a nd services increased 0.4 percent following a 
0.1 percent increase in June.  The increase in July wa s largely driven by higher 
merchandise exports, as services export s remained almost unchanged.  All major 
categories of merchandise posted modest gain s in July, with agri cultural goods providing 
the largest contributi on.  Within capital goods, strong expor ts of aircraft, semiconductors, 
and computers offset a decline in exports  of other capital goods (particularly 
telecommunication products).   
 
The value of imported goods and services decr eased 0.7 percent in July, after a rise of 
2.1 percent in June.  The value of oil imports increased strongly in both months; in July, 
however, the increase was more than offset by a decline in imports of both services and 
non-oil goods.  Within non-oil goods, a mode st increase in imports of automotive 
products in July was more than offset by declin es in imports of all ot her major categories.  
The decline in consumer goods in large part reflected a dr op in the volatile 
pharmaceutical category.  Within capital goods, the declines in July were widespread 
following equally widespr ead gains in June.

With the July trade data release, services exports and imports were revised for the 
January to June period.  The revisions for se rvices imports were fairly minor, whereas 
those for exports were more substantive.  Compared with the previously published data, 
the value of services exports was revised dow n $5 billion at an annual rate in the first 
quarter and $12.5 billion in the second quarter.   
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.    In August, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and core goods 
were both flat.  A small increase in the price index for non-oil industrial supplies was 
offset by small declines in the price inde xes for most other categories of imports.  
Following an increase of 0.4 percent in July, prices of non-oil indus trial supplies climbed 
an additional 0.2 percent in Augus t, with the increases in both  months primarily the result 
of higher natural gas prices.  Consumer goods  prices fell 0.2 percen t, with the decline 
widespread across consumption categories.   The prices of imported capital goods 
(excluding computers and semiconductors) fell 0.1 percent.  In August, prices for 
computers were flat, whereas prices of  semiconductors increased 0.5 percent. 
 The average level of core import prices in July and August was 0.75 percent at an annual 
rate below the second quarter average, as prices  in all sub-categories posted declines with 
the exception of automotive pr oducts.  The main contributors to the overall price decline 
were foods and non-oil industrial supplies,  which fell 6¼ percent and 1¼ percent, 
respectively.  Oil.  The BLS price of imported oil rose 7.1 per cent in August.  The spot price of West 
Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose 10.7 percent that month to average $65 per 
barrel.  The spot price climbed above $60 pe r barrel in the last week of July and 
continued climbing throughout the month to pe ak at $69.82 per barrel on August 30, in 
the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Before Katrina, the increase in the spot price reflected supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, India, Ecuador, 
and Africa, as well as heightened concerns about supplies from the Middle East.  Since 
its peak, the spot price has edged back down to close at $63.12 on September 13, as 
reduced crude oil demand due to shuttered refine ries and releases from strategic reserves 
have placed downward pressure on prices.

Exports.   In August, the price i ndex of U.S. exports of to tal goods fell 0.1 percent, 
whereas the prices of core goods increased 0.1 percent.  The increase in core export 
prices was primarily driven by a 0.3 percent increase in the prices  of non-agricultural 
industrial supplies, which more than offset a 0.6 percent fall in  the prices of agricultural 
exports.  The rise in the core  index was also supported by a 0.1 increase in the prices of 
capital goods (excluding computers and se miconductors).  The price indexes for 
automotive products and consumer goods were  unchanged.  In August, the prices of 
semiconductors fell 3.9 percent, whereas the prices of computer s rose 0.9 percent. 
 
The average level of prices in July and A ugust was 0.75 percent at an annual rate above 
the second quarter average, as a decline in consumer goods prices was more than offset by higher prices in all other sub-categories. The main contributors to the overall price 
increase were agricultural a nd industrial supplies prices, which climbed 4 percent and 
1 percent, respectively.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. secu rities were relativel y weak in the second 
quarter, but rebounded in July (line 4 of the Su mmary of U.S. International Transactions 
table).  A large part of the July upswing is at tributed to private fo reigners’ net purchases 
of Treasury securities, after ne t sales in June (line 4a).  In addition, private foreign net 
purchases of agency bonds, which had been w eak throughout the first half of this year, 
were near a record level in July (line 4b).  Private foreign net purchases of corporate 
bonds (line 4c) were robust in  the second quarter and remain ed strong in July, while net 
purchases of corporate stocks (line 4d) moved up slightly in July from their subdued pace 
of the second quarter.  Foreign official inflows (line 1)  were strong in both the second  quarter and in July after a 
subdued first quarter, with strong inflows from  countries outside of the G10 and OPEC.  
China has accounted for the bulk of official in flows to date this y ear, and Norway, which 
actively manages its oil fund, has contributed significantly to the monthly swings in these 
flows.  Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at FRBNY suggest further 
sizable foreign official inflows in August, but  these inflows stalled in the first weeks of 
September.    
 U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5)  picked up a bit in the second quarter and in 
July.  Net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b) slowed from their first-quarter pace, but 
U.S. purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) moved up from early in the year.  Given the ongoing review of the TIC data on net transa ctions in foreign bonds, however, it is 
difficult to know how much of  the recent increase in bond fl ows reflects larger purchases 
and how much reflects more complete reporting.    The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a modest inflow  in July.  For the year to 
date, the banking sector has recorded a net outflow of $37 billion.

Year to date, private foreign inflows into U. S. securities are a robust $318 billion – a pace 
running slightly ahead of last year’s record private inflows.  Howe ver, foreign official 
inflows so far this year are only $136 billion, well below the record inflows of the last 
two years.  Taken together, foreign official and private inflows are running below last 
year’s level.  In addition, U. S. acquisitions of foreign secu rities have been running at a 
pace above that of last year.  Offsetting thes e reductions in net portfolio inflows is a 
smaller net direct investment outflow in th e first quarter relative to the sizable net 
outflows recorded last year.  Second quarter direct investment data will be published 
September 16 and discussed in the Supplement.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The major currencies index of the dollar declined 1¼ percen t on net over the intermeeting 
period.  Much of this decline occurred in la te August, when short- and long-term dollar-
denominated interest rates generally fell mo re than those of other major industrial 
economies.  Energy prices rose sharply in la te August and early September following the 
landfall of Hurricane Katrina, but reversed some or all of these increases late in the inter-meeting period.  Major equity indexes rose  modestly across the globe over the period, 
driven by some better-than-expe cted earnings reports, the co ntinued declines in global 
interest rates, and the declines in energy prices towards the end for the intermeeting period.                     The dollar appreciated ½ percent on balance against the euro, but depreciated 2½ percent 
against the Canadian dollar and sterling and ¾ percent versus the yen.  The dollar 
depreciated broadly in late August, as mark et participants re-adjusted their relative 
growth and interest rate expectations of th e United States versus those of other major 
economies following the release of  U.S. manufacturing sector da ta that were weaker than 
had been expected.

                   Short-term Canadian dollar interest rates rose 16 basis points dur ing the intermeeting 
period.  On September 7 the Bank of Canada ra ised its policy rate by 25 basis points, to 
2.75 percent, in its first moneta ry policy adjustment in nearly  a year.  Yields implied by 
sterling interest rate futures cu rrently show that the market is pricing in the likelihood of 
an additional 25-basis-point cut by the Bank of  England by early next  year, but the staff 
forecast projects that the Bank of Engla nd’s policy will remain steady through 2007.  
Three-month euro interest rates were uncha nged on net; statements by European Central 
Bank President Trichet during the period highlight ed inflation risks, but were interpreted 
as indicating that the current stance of monetary policy was ap propriate in the near term.  
Ten-year sovereign yields were  little changed in Japan but  fell about 25 basis points in 
the euro area, largely in line with the dr op in the benchmark Treasury yield.  Headline 
equity indexes rose about 9 percent in Japa n but were nearly unchanged in Europe.  The 
outperformance of Japanese equities was le d by the banking sector, following several 
positive earnings reports and signs that banking profitability was in a sustained period of 
improvement.

In emerging markets, market participants co ntinued to focus on the evolution of China’s 
new exchange rate regime.  Since the 2.1 perc ent revaluation of the renminbi against the 
dollar on July 21, there have been only minimal daily fluctuations of the renminbi against 
the dollar.  Given this fact, there are only limited signs that the new renminbi 
management is based on minimizing changes in a trade-weighted index of the renminbi.  
Market participants have reduced their expe ctations for additional renminbi appreciation 
against the dollar, and 12-month NDF prices currently indicate onl y about 3 percent  
further renminbi appreciation.   
IV-13 
On net over the period, the dollar appreciated about 2½ percent agains t the Taiwan dollar, 
2 percent against the Indonesian rupiah, and 1 percent against the Korean won.  A few 
emerging Asian equity indexes also declined on balance as market participants focused 
on these countries’ dependence on imported en ergy. The Indonesian rupiah depreciated 
sharply early during the peri od, but recovered somewhat fo llowing a series of central 
bank monetary policy tightening measures desi gned to counter market concerns over the 
unsustainability of domestic energy price subsidies.  
 The dollar appreciated 1½ percent against th e Mexican peso and ½ percent against the 
Brazilian real.  Brazilian asset prices continued to be buffeted by market concerns over 
political corruption allegations  regarding the Lula administ ration.  Equity prices rose 
about 4 percent in Mexico and almost 9 percent in Brazil.  Market participants pointed to 
higher global commodity prices  as supporting these indexes,  especially Mexican share 
prices.  Mexico and Brazil’s EMBI+ spr eads were little changed on balance.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Growth in the foreign industrial countries rose on average in the second quarter, but 
performance across the different economies was mixed.  Japanese real GDP growth 
remained robust but moderated from exceptional performance in the first quarter as firms 
corrected rising inventory positions and house hold consumption returned toward more 
sustainable rates of growth.  German real GDP was stagnant while French real GDP rose 
only tepidly in the wake of a reversal in final domestic demand, leading overall growth in 
the euro area to slow.  Real GDP growth  in the United Kingdom improved slightly, 
although private consumption remained subdued.  Canadian real GDP picked up strongly 
as net exports rose after se veral quarters of decline.  
 Rising energy prices have recently caused some  increase in consumer price inflation, but 
inflation remains generally well contained despite this.  Mild deflation persists in Japan.  
In the euro area, core infla tion remained at its lowest ra te since early 2001, but energy 
prices have kept headline infl ation slightly above the ECB’s target ceiling of 2 percent.  
The inflation rate in the Un ited Kingdom moved above the Bank of England’s 2 percent 
target in July, driven by rising costs for se rvices.  Headline inflation in Canada also 
picked up in July, but core inflation remains moderate. 
 In Japan , real GDP grew 3.3 percent at an annual rate in the second qu arter.  Gross fixed 
investment rose 10.9 percent and private consum ption rose 2.4 percen t, but the rise in 
final demand was partly offset by a negative contribution from invent ories as firms began 
to rein in inventory levels that had built up over the previous six months.  Net exports 
made a larger-than-expected positive c ontribution to GDP growth following three 
quarters of negative contribution, perhaps partly driven by the rise in the dollar relative to 
the yen over the first half of the year; e xports rose 12.1 percent, while imports rose 
6 percent.    Monthly indicators point to a weak start to the third quarter.  Real workers’ household 
spending fell 4.2 percent and retail sales fell 2.2 percent in July, led by sharp declines in 
monthly automobile sales.  Industrial production fell 1.1 percent in July, although a 
survey of Japanese firms projects gains in August and September.  The purchasing 
manager’s index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to 53.8 in August to mark the first decline 
since December.  The nominal trade surplus fe ll in July as increases in oil and other 
commodity prices sent imports  higher, although in real term s exports held steady while 
imports declined. 
IV-15 
Japanese labor markets continue to gradua lly improve.  The unemployment rate edged 
back up to 4.4 percent in July from its seven- year low of 4.2 percent in June, but this was 
due to a rise in labor forc e participation.   Nominal wages were up 0.3 percent from a 
year ago in July, marking the fourth consecu tive month of wage in flation on a year-over-
year basis.    Nationwide core consumer prices (which ex clude fresh food but include energy) fell 
0.2 percent in July from a year ago. The GDP deflator fell 0.7 percent below its year-ago 
level in the second quarter.  Monetary po licy was unchanged.  The balance of reserve 
accounts again fell temporarily below the Bank of Japan’s fl oor of ¥30 trillion, for three 
days in early August, but has since returned  to within the Bank’s target range of  
¥30-35 trillion.  The BOJ continues to state that it will maintain its po licy of quantitative 
easing until deflation ends.     The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) scor ed a major victory in the September 11 
elections for the Lower House of Parliame nt, winning its first outright majority in 
15 years.  Prime Minister Koizumi is expect ed to reintroduce his bills to privatize the 
postal savings system later this month.  A lthough the bills were defeated by the Upper 
House in August, the electoral victory for Koizumi and his allies within the LDP is 
expected to ensure that the bills will now pass both houses of Parliament by the end of 
the year.

Real GDP growth in the  euro area  slowed to 1.2 percent in th e second quarter after being 
revised downward 0.5 percentage point to 1.4 pe rcent in the first qua rter.  The slowdown 
in the second quarter was mainly the result of a dip in private consumption, which shrank 
for the first time in more than three year s, by 0.1 percent.  The contribution of final 
domestic demand remained positive, how ever, as rising investment and public 
expenditures more than offset the fall in consumption.  After providing considerable 
stimulus to growth in the first quarter, the external sector contri buted only 0.2 percentage 
points to second-quarter GDP growth, as exports rose only marginally faster than 
imports.  Inventories increased by a large amou nt, adding 0.7 percenta ge points to overall 
growth.  Indicators for the current quarter suggest that the pace of economic activity is picking up.    
In July, industrial production grew at a robust pace in Germany, although it fell 
unexpectedly in France.  Industrial orders have improved in recent months, with euro-
area orders up 3.7 percent in June and German orders also up 3.7 percent in July.  Euro-
area retail sales dipped a bit in July, howe ver, indicating that households’ demand has 
remained weak. 
IV-17 
Euro-area economic sentiment improved in August for the third consecutive month, 
recording the highest reading since Febr uary.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI 
remained above the 50 threshold for growth in August after posting a considerable gain in 
July.  The PMI for the services sector rema ined near the 53 mark, where it has been for 
much of the year.  In Germany, the IFO index of manufacturing sentiment edged down in August but remained well-above the second-quarter level.  Labor market conditions continued to show  some improvement, with the euro-area 
unemployment rate edging down to 8.6 percent in  July.  In spite of the surge in energy 
prices, twelve-month consumer price infla tion fell to 2.1 percent in August.  Core 
inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, has fallen sin ce the start of the year 
and was unchanged at 1.4 percent in July.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 1.9 percent in the second quarter, revised up 
from a preliminary estimate of 1.5 percent.  A rise in expenditures on durable goods led 
consumption to grow 0.9 percent, slightly be tter than its first quarter pace.  Fixed 
investment rose 6.2 percent and net exports contributed 2.2 percentage points to growth, 
but real GDP was held down by a negativ e contribution from inventories.   
 Early indicators for the third quarter point to continued moderate growth.  After falling 
throughout the second quarter, business c onfidence rebounded str ongly in July and 
remained in positive territory in August.  The PMI for manufacturing squeaked above the 
50 mark in August, while the PMI for servi ces remained near its  2005 average of 55. 
 Month-to-month house price growth continues to be just slight ly positive.  According to 
the Nationwide Building Society index of house prices, the twelve-month change of 
house prices was 2.4 percent in August.  Household net borrowing for house purchase 
remained stable in August at ₤11.6 billion. 
 Inflationary pressures have increased recentl y.  The twelve-month rate of consumer price 
inflation surpassed the Bank of England’s 2 percent target in July and continued to 
accelerate to 2.4 percent in August.  Twelve -month inflation excluding energy fell one 
tenth of a percentage point to 1.8 percent in  August.  The labor market in the United 
IV-19 
Kingdom remains tight, as the unemployment rate continues to be near record lows.  The 
twelve-month growth rate of unit labor co sts rose from 2.8 to 4.1 percent in July.

Activity in Canada  accelerated in the second quarte r.  Real GDP grew 3.2 percent 
following downwardly-revised growth of 2.1 per cent in the first quarter.  The stronger-
than-expected outcome masked the reversal  of a recent pattern of high growth in 
domestic demand coupled with soft net exte rnal demand.  Final domestic demand growth 
slowed from its first-quarter surge, as  consumption rose 2.4 percent and business 
investment advanced 4.2 percent.  Expor ts edged up moderately, while imports, 
following four straight quarters of strong ga ins, fell 3.5 percent, causing net exports to 
contribute 1.8  percentage points to growth.   
 Early indicators for the third quarter suggest continued streng th.  The composite index of 
leading indicators continued its recent string of solid advances in July.  After surprisingly 
strong growth throughout the year, housing star ts, despite a decline in August, remain 
elevated.  Moderate job gains continued in July and August, with the unemployment rate 
holding near a 30-year low of 6.8 percent.  The real merchandise trade balance expanded 
in July, with volumes in most export categor ies up from the previous month and most 
import categories recording declines.   
 
In July, the twelve-month rate of consum er price inflation moved up to 2 percent , largely 
due to upward pressure from gas prices.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, 
excluding the eight most volatile  components, slipped to 1.5 pe rcent.  In response to the 
higher headline inflation, the Bank of Canada  raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 
2.75 percent in September.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Second-quarter growth in the emerging ma rket economies picked up on average after 
slowing in the first quarter, although there was considerable variation across countries.  
More recently, performance has remained mixe d.  In Asia, a second-quarter slowdown in 
China was more than offset by a reb ound in Singapore and Thailand and by a 
Disneyland-related surge in ac tivity in Hong Kong.  Growth was also solid in Korea and 
India.  In Latin America, Mexican real GDP declined, while growth in Brazil was 
surprisingly strong.  Data releases for Ju ly have been mixed in emerging market 
economies.  The rise in interna tional oil prices has contributed to an increase in inflation, 
but the impact has varied wide ly, reflecting in part varying degrees of oil intensity and 
controls on domestic fuels prices.  Recent data from China  point to growth at a more moderate pace than over the past 
several years, mainly as a result of slowi ng investment, which declined in July for the 
first time this year.  Imports also fell in  July before snapping back in August.  The 
average rate of industrial produc tion growth over the past several months is about half of 
last year’s pace.  The PMI came down in A ugust, although it remained in expansionary 
territory.  On the other hand, in July and A ugust, retail sales con tinued to grow at a 
double-digit pace and exports continued to soar.  For 2005 through August, the trade surplus was about $70 billion, more than doubl e the surplus for all of 2004.  Consumer 
price inflation moved down in August as food pr ice inflation fell to be low 1 percent.  The 
authorities have been raising domestic prices of  fuels, but to date th ose hikes have lagged 
increases in world prices of fuels.

Second quarter real GDP grew an  astounding 12½ percent (a.r.) in Hong Kong , driven by 
a surge in activity related to preparations fo r the opening of Disneyland.  July exports and 
imports both fell from their very high June le vels, and the resulting trade deficit was little 
changed from the previous month.  Consum er price inflation inched up in July.

Taiwanese  real GDP grew about 3¼ percent in th e second quarter.  Exports made the 
largest contribution to overall growth, but personal consumption and investment spending 
were both up.  Industrial produc tion fell sharply in July, reve rsing part of June’s large 
gain, but the output of high-t ech components rose.  The aver age trade surplus over July 
and August was little changed fr om its second-quarter level.   Consumer price inflation 
jumped in August due to higher fuels prices  and typhoon-related increases in food prices.

Recent indicators for Korea  have remained positive.  Revised data for second-quarter 
GDP growth confirmed the preliminary estimate  of 5 percent.  Industrial production rose 
1.3 percent in July following a strong performa nce in June.  Recent sales and confidence 
surveys are holding at high levels.  Exports re mained elevated, and the trade surplus rose 
despite strong oil imports.  Consumer pri ce inflation decelerated further in August, 
although the fuel component registered sizeable gains.  Housing prices in selected areas 
rose sharply, prompting the government in  August to announce hikes in property and 
capital gains taxes and measures aimed at increasing housing supply.

In the ASEAN region, performance varied in the second quarter.  Real GDP rebounded in 
Singapore and Thailand from first-quarter declines and accelerated in the Philippines, but stagnated in Indonesia and Ma laysia following strong first- quarter growth.  Domestic 
factors contributed to the di vergent performance, including a resurgence of output in 
Singapore’s volatile biomedical sector and, in Thailand, a rec overy from the tsunami and 
a drought.  More recently, July industri al production was down in Thailand and 
Singapore from the very strong se cond quarter, and fell in Malaysia as well.  In July, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore continued to record high trad e surpluses, while 
Thailand reversed a string of large deficits as a result of plummeting imports.  With the 
exception of Singapore, consumer price inflati on continued to be el evated, reflecting the 
higher price of oil, and in some countries, a reduction in fuel s ubsidies and higher food 
prices.     Since the last Greenbook, monetary policie s have been tightened in Thailand and 
Indonesia.  On September 8, Thailand’s central  bank raised its policy rate 50 basis points 
to 3.25 percent.  Indonesia’s central bank tig htened policy in late August and early 
September in response to strong downward pressures on the rupiah and stock prices, 
which raised the prospect that the country ma y be entering a financial crisis.  Analysts 
have been concerned about rising inflati on, a weaker-than-expected Q2 GDP, and the 
fiscal burden from fuel subsidies, given Indone sia’s high level of public  debt.  Since late 
August, the Indonesian central bank’s target for the one-month interest rate has risen 
from 8.75 percent to 10 percent, which has helped stabilize a sset prices, and the 
government has given indications that fuel s ubsidies will be reduced in coming months.

In India , incoming data point to c ontinued robust growth.  In dustrial production was up 
3½ percent in the second quarter before a weat her-related decline in July, and indicators 
of consumer demand are strong.  Twelve-mont h consumer price inflation turned up in 
July, however, and the government raised gasoli ne and diesel prices by 7 percent in early 
September, the second such increase this year .  The relatively slow  rate of pass-through 
of oil prices has resulted in losses at I ndia’s state-owned oil companies and reduced 
government revenues.  Rising oil pric es are also boosting imports.

In Mexico , recent data releases poin t to a weaker-than-expected pace of expansion in 
economic activity.  Real GDP fell 1.7 percent (a .r.) in the second quarter.  The slowdown 
was concentrated in manufacturing, particul arly the auto sector, reflecting weak U.S 
demand for Mexican manufactures.  In addition, high real interest rates appear to have 
IV-31 
begun to weigh on domestic demand.  There was also an unexpected decline in 
agricultural production.  July industrial produc tion and export performance were weaker 
than expected.  Aggressive monetary policy ti ghtening by the Bank of Mexico  (BOM) from early 2004 to 
March 2005 appears to have been effectiv e in reducing inflation.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation was 3.9 percent in August, down from the 5.3 percent registered 
at the end of last year and w ithin the upper limit of the target  range of 2 to 4 percent.  
Furthermore, twelve-month core inflation ha s continued to trend down, to 3.3 percent in 
August.  High international oil prices have  not passed through to domestic inflation 
because of controls on fuels prices.  The slowing economy and improved inflation prospects led the BOM to begin easing policy in late August.  The rate on 28-day peso-
denominated bills, a widely used measure of the monetary policy stance, has fallen from 
9.6 in early August to 9.4 in early September.

In Brazil , real GDP was up 5¾ percent in the second quarter, following a weak first 
quarter.  Growth was led by a 20 percent jump in investment, which did not quite reverse 
the previous two successive quarters of sh arp declines.  Private consumption was up 
3¾ percent, supported by recove ring real incomes and a ra pid expansion of consumer 
IV-32 
credit, despite extremely high nom inal and real interest rates.   On the production side, the 
extractive sector soared 75 per cent (a.r.), reflecting rapid incr eases in output of petroleum 
and other commodities, while manufacturing out put jumped nearly 8 percent.  July 
industrial production, however, plummeted 2½ percent and the decline was broadly 
based.  Consumer price inflation was only 0.2 percent in August, bringing twelve-month 
inflation down to 6 percent.  The fall in infl ation reflects in part a decline in food prices 
and the continued pass-through fr om the appreciation of the real earlier this year.  In 
addition, government-controlled Petrobras had not changed domestic prices of gasoline 
and diesel fuel in 2005 until September 9, when the company raised prices of gasoline and diesel fuel at its refinery gates by about 15 percent. 
  In mid-August, the central bank kept its policy  rate on hold for the third straight month.  
The monetary policy committee’s minutes, how ever, removed language suggesting that 
interest rates would remain at current rates for a “suffi ciently long time” to contain 
inflation, raising expectations that the po licy rate will be cut at the mid-September 
meeting.  Political scandals that involve memb ers of Lula’s party and administration have 
continued to dominate the congressional ag enda, dashing hopes of  progress on economic 
reforms before the October 2006 presidential election.

In Argentina , the pace of the economic recovery from the 2001-02 financial crisis 
appears to have accelerated in  the second quarter, after a sl owdown in the first quarter.  
Although industrial production growth slowed in the second quarter, the monthly index 
IV-33 
of economic activity, which has closely tracked real GDP growth in recent years, jumped 
7 percent, up from 4¾ percent in the fi rst quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price 
inflation has moved up this year, reaching al most 10 percent in August, well above the 
central bank’s informal target range of 5- 8 percent for the end of 2005.  The central bank 
has continued to intervene to st em upward pressures on the peso. 
 In mid-August, an IMF mission to Buenos Aires was cancelled shortly before it was 
scheduled to take place.  Indications are th at the mission will o ccur after the October 
Congressional elections to give time for the Argentine Congress to pass a 2006 budget.  
The Fund has been pressing for tighter fiscal  and monetary policies, more progress on 
banking and utility sector reforms, and a normalization of relations with holdout 
creditors

In Venezuela , real GDP soared 23 percent (a.r.) in  the second quarter according to staff 
estimates, reflecting a 30 percent increase in non-petroleum activity.  Activity was 
boosted by expansionary policie s that have been supported by the high price of oil.  
Petroleum sector activity was up a relatively  tepid 3 percent.  The oil sector’s Q2 
performance is consistent with anecdotal ev idence that oil production and investment 
have been constrained by the Chavez governme nt’s hostile approach to private investors, 
by management problems at the government oil firm, PdVSA, and by the government’s 
transfer of PdVSA profits to social development funds.
