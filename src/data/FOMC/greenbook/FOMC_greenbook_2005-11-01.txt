II-1                                                 Overview 
Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast on September 24, barely four weeks after Hurricane 
Katrina.  These storms caused consider able damage and disr uption, and although the 
overall magnitudes of their im mediate effect and aftermath are still uncertain, they 
undoubtedly depressed economic activity in Sept ember and October.  The energy sector 
was most clearly affected, as the hurricanes  severely curtailed oil and natural gas 
extraction and petroleum refining in the Gulf  region.  Despite progress in bringing the 
Gulf’s energy production capacity back on line, a significant porti on of that capacity 
remains shut in, and recovery is expected to continue for some time.  Energy prices 
jumped sharply in the wake of each hurri cane, and while the ongoing restoration of 
energy production capacity has brought ener gy prices down from their post-hurricane 
peaks, they generally remain at lofty levels.   
 
The limited information currently available suggests that economic activity outside of the 
Gulf region, at least so far, appears to have been well maintained.  Hiring in September in 
the areas unaffected by the hurricanes was reported to be in line with  its moderate pace of 
expansion over the preceding year, and, exclud ing the estimated eff ects of the hurricanes 
and the Boeing strike on production, industrial output increased briskly last month.  In addition, residential construction remained  buoyant.  Consumer spending, however, 
showed some signs of weakness.  Although sp ending appears to have been strong for the 
third quarter as a whole, it was particularly soft in September, and consumer confidence 
has slumped noticeably since August.  Desp ite the huge increase in consumer energy 
costs, core price inflation was stil l restrained through September.   
 
Energy Sector  
Hurricane Rita caused further disruption to en ergy production in the Gulf area, which had 
not yet fully recovered from Hu rricane Katrina.  Immediatel y after the second hurricane, 
essentially all crude oil extraction, more than  three-quarters of natural gas extraction, and 
about two-thirds of petroleum refining in the Gulf region was shut in.1  The energy 
production lost in the Gulf area limited total domestic crude oil production and petroleum 
refining to about 70 percent of  their pre-Katrina levels, wh ile total domestic natural gas 
production stood at about 85 percent of its pre-hurricane level.  
 
Activity in October is still below pre-hurrican e levels, although progress has been made 
in bringing shutdown energy facilities back on line.  As of October 24, total domestic crude oil production was running at about 80 percent of its pr e-Katrina level, and natural 
gas production remained below 90 pe rcent of its pr e-hurricane rate.
2  Full recovery is not 
expected until the spring of next year.  Meanwhile, four Gulf area refineries remain idle,  
 
1 The Gulf region accounts for near ly 30 percent of U.S. crude oil extraction, about 20 percent of 
natural gas extraction, and 47 percent of domestic refining capacity. 
2 A few platforms were evacuated as a precautionary  measure prior to Hurricane Wilma’s entry into 
the Gulf.  However, thes e shutdowns, which account for little additional shut-in production, should be 
temporary.

and another six are in the pro cess of restarting or are operating at reduced rates, keeping 
domestic refining output below 90 percent of its pre-Katrina level.  Some refinery 
outages are expected to last  until the end of the year. 
 
While Hurricane Katrina had trimmed a bit off industrial production at the end of August, 
the hurricanes caused the IP index for oil and natural gas extraction and refining to 
plummet 11 percent in September.  Alt hough the level of production in the energy 
industries remains below pre-hurri cane levels, the industries’ recoveries are expected to 
provide a small boost to the rate of change in energy IP in October. 
 
Following the hurricanes, rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of 
gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset some of the output losses in 
refined products.  In addition, to address the low level of gaso line inventories and 
more-immediate retail demands, domestic refiners sharply increased the share of gasoline 
in their output of total refined product.3  These developments helped to boost gasoline 
inventories a bit, although th ey still hover near their low pre-hurricane levels.  At the 
same time, inventories of heating oil and othe r refined products (such as diesel fuel and 
jet fuel) have declined from their high pre- hurricane levels as a result of shutdown 
production and the shift in the refining mix.  In contrast, as the Gulf’s natural gas 
production capacity has recovered, inventor ies of natural gas have continued to 
accumulate, and their current le vel is a little above average for this time of year.   
 
Wholesale gasoline prices spiked soon after R ita’s landfall but have since declined to pre-
hurricane levels.  Retail prices  for regular gasoline have de clined more than 30 cents per 
gallon from their post-Rita peak.  Although retail gasoline prices and margins are down 
from their recent highs, they remain above le vels seen before the hurricanes.  Prices for 
heating oil are signifi cantly above their pre-Katrina peak.  The shift in the refining mix, 
and concerns about supply for the winter, have  resulted in heating oil prices falling back 
only modestly as refining capacity has come back on line.  Rising spot prices for natural gas soared further with the hurricanes and remain at elevated levels, even though the inventory situation for natural gas appears co mfortable at the moment.  Indeed, because 
of limited capability to import natural gas, conc erns about the adequacy of inventories for 
the peak winter heating season have intensifie d as some capacity in the Gulf is expected 
to remain shut in through the end of the winter.   
 
Labor Market Developments 
The rise in employment in September was held down by job losses associated with 
Hurricane Katrina.  Private nonf arm payrolls fell 66,000 in Sept ember, whereas the level  
                                                 
3 By mid-October, gasoline’s share of  total refining output was about 55 percent, significantly above its 
usual 49 percent share for October.

of private employment in  August was revised up 51,000.4,5   Although the BLS did not 
publish a precise figure on hurrica ne-related job losses, it stated that employment in the 
areas unaffected by the hurricane appeared to increase in line with the average pace over 
the twelve months ending in August.  On the basis of this information, we estimate that 
Hurricane Katrina held down employment by approximately 220,000 in September.6  
However, measuring the change in employme nt stemming from such a major disruption 
is difficult and is associated with a wide band of uncertainty. 
 
The largest employment loss in September occurred in the leisure and hospitality 
category, an industry particularly hard hit by Hurricane Katrina.  Employment in retail 
trade also registered a sharp decline, mu ch of which was likely the consequence of 
hurricane disruptions and higher energy prices .  In manufacturing, only the ship and boat 
building category experienced job losses that appeared to be related directly to the hurricane.  Elsewhere in manufacturing, and in  industries such as natural resources and 
health services, establishments in the storm- affected region, particularly large ones, had 
apparently either reopened, continued to pa y their idle employees, or relocated such 
employees.  Also, the marked increase in the demand for workers in temporary help services may have reflected in pa rt the hiring of relief workers. 
 
The workweek remained at 33.7 hours in September, and aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined 0.2 percent,  an indication of only a small hurricane-
related effect.  For the third quarter as a w hole, aggregate hours increased at an annual 
rate of 1.7 percent after a rise of 2.8 percent in the s econd quarter.   
 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage point in 
September to 5.1 percent, largely because of an increase in the number of newly 
unemployed.  Although the BLS did not estimate the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the unemployment rate, part of the increase may be attributable to the hur ricane.  In contrast, 
the participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent in September.  While some  individuals 
displaced by Hurricane Katrina ma y have reported themselves as being out of the labor  
                                                 
4 Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf two weeks before th e reference period for the September survey.  In 
response, the BLS made unprecedented changes in ho w it processed the establishment survey data.  In 
areas that FEMA deemed flooded or hit by catastrophic or extensive damage, the BLS imputed zero 
employment for nonresponding establishments rather than following its usual procedure of imputing the 
change according to the reports of similar establishmen ts.  Furthermore, the BLS included data from firms 
in the New Orleans, Gulfport-Biloxi, and Pascagula metropolitan areas that reported zero employment 
rather than following its usual procedure of assuming that  these were firm terminations that were offset by 
startups.  Finally, the BLS reweighted the data in  the hardest-hit counties, where underreporting was a 
problem.  Hurricane Rita made landfall after the reference period for the September survey. 
5 The BLS announced that its preliminary benchm ark revision estimate wo uld reduce total nonfarm 
payroll employment in the March 2005 reference month by 191,000, or 0.1 percent, a fairly small revision. 
6 In addition, employment counts in September were depressed by 22,500 because of the strikes at 
Boeing and Northwest Airlines.  The Boeing strike ended on September 29, and the 18,300 employees who 
were on strike will reappear on payrolls in October.   However, the 4,200 mechanics at Northwest Airlines 
who went on strike on August 20 have not yet returned to work.

force, the number of individuals reporting that they had a job but were not at work 
because of bad weather increased tremendously last month to a seasonally adjusted level 
of 408,000, the highest level since the hurricane-aff ected September reading of last year.   
Initial claims for unemployment insurance are indicative of substantial job losses 
associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  As of the week ending October 15, the Employment and Training Administration ( ETA) estimates that nearly 480,000 of the 
claims filed since early September ha ve been related to the hurricanes.
7  Alternatively, 
the cumulative effects of the hurricanes can  be measured by the increase in insured 
unemployment, which, as of the week e nding October 8, stood about 300,000 above its 
pre-Katrina level.  However, job losses associated with the hurricanes appear to be subsiding.  In the most recent reporti ng week, 355,000 new claims were filed––well 
below the peak of the surge after the hurrica nes and almost back to its pre-hurricane 
range. 
 
Most other indicators of current labor market  activity appear to have been unaffected by 
the hurricanes—at least so far––and remain generally consistent with moderately 
improving labor market conditions.  The e xhaustion rate moved down in September, 
retracing its August rise.  After falling sharply in June, the pe rcentage of the labor force 
unemployed more than twenty-six weeks ha s moved up gradually over the past several 
months, but still remains below the May le vel.  Layoff announcements fell back in 
August from early summer highs and persisted at this lower level in September.  The 
share of firms reporting to the National Fe deration of Independent Businesses (NFIB) 
that they had a hard-to-fill position was little changed in September and remained close to 
its highest level this year.  However, household percepti ons of labor market conditions 
were a little less upbeat.  According to the Conference Board, household assessments of job availability were nearly unchanged in October after having fallen sharply in September to their lowest level since the end of last year.   
 
Forward-looking indicators of labor market  conditions paint a mixed picture, as 
households’ expectations are appa rently less optimistic than those of businesses.  The net 
hiring plans of small businesses reporting to  the NFIB were unchanged last month after 
having popped up in August, and the three-m onth moving average climbed to its highest 
level since February.  In c ontrast, households’ expected labor market conditions, as 
reported in both the Michigan and Conference Board surveys in September, fell back to their lowest levels in several years.  In  October, the preliminary reading from the 
Michigan survey suggests only a slight recovery in expectations, while expectations in 
the Conference Board survey worsened a bit further. 
 
Industrial Production  
The hurricanes and the strike at Boeing took thei r toll on industrial output in September.  
As a result, total IP fell 1.3 percent.  But,  excluding the effects of the hurricane-related  
                                                 
7 This estimate is also subject to some uncertainty .  In particular, the ETA simply tallies the reports 
filed by the state agencies, and diffe rent states may have used different  criteria to categorize claims as 
hurricane-related.

disturbances and the Boeing stri ke, industrial production is esti mated to have risen a brisk 
0.8 percent in September.  Our best estimate of the effects of the hurricanes in September 
is that the change in IP was reduced by a bout 1.7 percentage points , and the Boeing strike 
subtracted nearly another 0.5 percentage point .  For the third quarter as a whole, IP 
increased at an annual rate of just 1.3 pe rcent, about the same pace as in the second 
quarter, when output was restrained by a ma rked slowing in inventory accumulation.  
Excluding the hurricane and strike effects, the thir d-quarter rise in IP is estimated to have 
been at an annual rate of about 5.2 percent.  Besides the energy-producing industries, the hurricanes al so significantly affected 
chem
icals producers.  In particular, petroc hemical production, which is concentrated 
along the Gulf Coast near feedstocks, plunge d 20 percent in September.  As of 
October 17, facilities that account for roughly 12.5 percent of domestic petrochemical 
capacity remained closed.  Elsewhere, manufacturing output fe ll noticeably in the 
shipbuilding, food manufactur ing (including sugar, coffee,  seafood, and poultry), paper, 
and plywood industries.  The machinists’ strike at Boeing, which la sted from Septem
 ber 2 to September 29, 
caused the company to cease nearly all comm ercial aircraft production during the month.8  
Boeing expects to return pr oduction rapidly to pre-strike  levels—thereby contributing 
about ½ percentage point to the change in IP in October—and will likely boost output further in the coming months to make up for the production losses.  Elsewhere in 
transportation equipment, motor vehicle production climbed 300,000 units in September 
to an annual rate of 12.5 million units.  In the third quarter, automakers assembled vehicles at an annual rate of 12.2 million uni ts, a pace about ½ million units higher than 
assemblies in the second quarter.  Despite curr ent inventories of light  motor vehicles near 
a record low after the summer sell-off, the industry plans to begin the official 2006 model 
year with a production rate of 11.9 million units in the fourth quarter, about 300,000 units below the third-quarter pace.  High-tech output—led by strong gains in the production of semiconductors and communications equipm
ent—surged  3¾ percent in September.  In the third quarter, high-
tech output rose at an annual rate of 31 per cent, a significant acceler ation from the tepid 
second-quarter pace and the largest quarterly increase since the middle of 2000.  
Semiconductor production jumped 4.6 percent in September, and monthly output gains averaged almost 4 percent during the third quar ter.  Production gains in the industry were 
broad-based and were led by especially large increases for chips used in communications 
equipment and consumer electronics.  Intel’s revenue guidance for the fourth quarter  
                                                
 
8 Machinists at Boeing’s facilities in Long Beach, Ca lif., are covered by a diffe rent union contract and 
continued to produce new 717s, although they are regularly scheduled to deliver only one plane per month.  
The company reported that six 737s were delivered in September, but final delivery represents a fairly 
small share of the production of an aircraft.

suggests continued strength in real output of microprocesso rs, though the pace of 
production gains will likely slow a bit.  Although the monthly inde x for communications 
equipment has been volatile of late, pr oduction has expanded substantially—output 
jumped at an annual rate of nearly 30 per cent in the third quarter ––and industry reports 
support a bright outlook for this sector.  Computer producers remain the laggards among 
domestic high-tech manufacturers, as producti on gains are running be low the pace of the 
late 1990s.  However, recent data from Gart ner indicates that sales of PCs and servers 
were strong in the third quarter, and that strength is perhaps a forerunner of a larger step-
up in production in this category. 
 
In other market groups, output gains continue to be mixed.  Excludi ng the strike-related 
drop in aircraft production, the output of business equipment rose in September and was 
up at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent dur ing the third quarter.  In addition, the output 
of defense and space equipment jumped at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the 
third quarter despite the hurricanes’ disr uption to shipbuilding.  In contrast, the 
production of consumer goods, which had been weak over most of the year, only edged 
up in September.  The production of constructio n supplies rose slightly  in September, but 
output increased at an annua l rate of 3.3 percent for th e third quarter overall, and 
production should be supported in the future by the rebuilding in the Gulf region.  The 
output of business supplies edged down for a fourth consecutive month in September. 
 
Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity generally  point to solid production 
gains in the coming months.  The three-month moving average of the Board staff’s series 
on real adjusted durable goods orders rose about 1¾ percent in August, and the Institute 
for Supply Management’s new orders diffusion index jumped in September to its highest level in more than a year.  The first readings  for October from the regional surveys were 
also favorable; the new orders diffusion i ndexes from both the FRB New York and the 
FRB Philadelphia surveys rose smartly to levels  consistent with solid output gains in the 
months ahead. 
 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles declined more than 400,000 units in September to an annual rate of 16.3 million units.  General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler extended their employee discount 
programs through the end of September.  By most accounts, however, the pricing schemes, which had boosted sales to near-reco rd levels earlier in the summer, offered 
only modest support to sales in September, as they had been set to expire earlier and their potential effect had likely alre ady run much of its course.
9  In addition, inventories of the 
most popular GM and Ford 2005 models were nearly depleted at the beginning of September.  For the third quarter as a whole,  however, sales of light vehicles averaged 
17.9 million units, the highest pace recorded in almost four years.   
 
                                                 
9 September marked the fourth month of employee discount pricing at General Motors, and the third at 
Ford and Chrysler.

II-17 
Because employee discounts substituted fo r traditional consumer incentives in 
September, the average incentive per light  vehicle sold declined $66 last month.10  In 
October, incentives have fallen an additio nal $60 despite the expi ration of the employee 
discount programs.  Part of the recent decline reflects a sharp drop in September in the 
market share of large and mid-sized SUVs, wh ich carry larger cash-back rebates than do 
other market segments.  Going forward, statements by General Motors—the market leader in incentives—indicate that the auto maker intends to curtail incentives for the 
2006 model year.  GM’s commitment to pric ing with lower average incentives over the 
next several months is a t opic of industry speculation, and the transition could be 
challenged if sales are weak this fall.   
 
Although price discounts boosted consumers’ car buying attitudes this summer, high 
gasoline prices took a toll on consumer sen timent in September and October.  Motor 
vehicle buying conditions, as measured in the Michigan SRC index, fell sharply in 
September, and preliminary data for October indicate that the inde x has edged down a bit 
further this month.  The per centage of respondents who blamed high gasoline prices or 
gasoline shortages for the deterioration in vehicle buying conditions jumped to 20 percent 
in September and increased further to 24 percen t in October, a level not seen since July 
1979.   
 
Looking ahead, automakers anticipate that the pace of sales will cool considerably in the 
fourth quarter, partly as payback for the sa les this summer that were brought forward by 
the discount programs.  Press reports in Oct ober indicate that showroom traffic at auto 
dealerships has slumped, and our industry contac ts anticipate that sales of light vehicles 
in October will move down into the range of 14½ million to 15½ million units. 
 
Consumer Spending  
Real consumer spending appears to have increased at an annu al rate of about 3½ percent 
in the third quarter as a whole, although it slowed markedly in August and September 
after having risen substantially  earlier in the summer.  The recent slump in spending 
reflects in part the diminishing boost to light  vehicle sales from manufacturers’ employee 
discount programs.  However, spending on other goods and services has also been 
sluggish, likely as a consequence of the direct effects of th e dislocation of households by 
the hurricanes, stratospheric energy prices, and falling consumer confidence.  The 
personal saving rate has been below zero sin ce June and stood at negative ¾ percent in 
August, held down 0.3 percentage  point, according to the BEA, by the estimated effects 
on personal income of Hurricane Katrina.  
 
In the retail control category of goods, which excludes sa les by auto dealers and building 
material and supply stores, nominal spendi ng increased 1 percent in September—about 
the same as in August—and was led by an incr ease of 4 percent in spending at gasoline 
stations.  Retail sales at ga soline stations include items other than gasoline, such as  
                                                 
10 The employee discounts were measured as reductions in price and not as incentives by J.D. Power 
and Associates.

purchases at convenience stores , but a 4 percent increase is remarkably small in light of 
the 18 percent rise in gasoline prices last month.  Taking the retail sales data at face 
value, we estimate that real spending in PCE goods excluding motor vehicles fell 
0.8 percent in September after ha ving been unchanged in August.11   
 
Rising home prices have con tinued to boost household wealth , but equity prices have 
declined recently, and other fundamentals for consumer spending have also been a little 
less favorable because of factors related to the hurricanes.  Although nominal wages and 
salaries rose in August, real  disposable income fell ½ per cent, mostly because of steep 
increases in energy prices and Hurricane Katr ina’s hit to rental and proprietor’s income.12  
Increases in average hourly earnings suggest a further gain in  nominal wages and salaries 
in September, but sharply higher energy prices presumably held down real income last month.  Rising interest rates are also dampi ng the rise in consumer spending.  Consumer 
sentiment in October, as measured by both the preliminary reading of the Michigan 
Survey and the Conference Board, dropped a little further after having plunged in September.  Consumer sentiment appears to have weakened even more than underlying fundamentals would suggest and is likely put ting some downward pressure on spending. 
 
Housing Markets  
Residential construction has continued at a robust pace.  New single-family homes were 
started at an annual rate of 1.75 million units in  September, a bit above their average level 
in the first half of the year.  New adjusted permit issuance jumped in September to a new 
high of 1.75 million units, while the backlog of unused permits was still near record levels.  In the multifamily sector, starts in August and September remained at the average 
pace seen since 2001.  Permits for these units in the past two months were a bit lower 
than in the first half of the year but remained strong in comparison with previous years.  
 
New home sales in August fell 9.9 percent from Ju ly’s elevated level to an annual rate of 
1.24 million units. The stock of new homes for sale moved up in August and represented 
4.7 months of supply at August’s sales pace.   Although months’ supply is now at the 
upper end of the range it has occupied since 1996, it remains low by historical norms.  
Sales of existing sing le-family homes rose 0.6 percent in September after having risen 
1¾ percent in August.  Inventories of existi ng homes for sale moved up in September and  
                                                 
11 Because Department of Energy data indicate that nominal gasoline sales increased 15 percent in 
September, this estimate was constructed by using the BEA’s standard methodology, which allocates most 
of the apparent relative weakness in retail sales at gasoline stations to other expenditure categories. 
12 The BEA’s hurricane-related adjustments to personal income in August, which include a $92 billion 
decrease in rental income and a $6 billion reduction in proprietors’ income, were partly offset by a 
$72 billion increase in transfer paym ents. The decreases in rental and proprietors’ income stem from 
estimated uninsured losses in housing and proprietorships, and the increase in transfer payments reflects 
estimated business payments for insured losses outsid e these two categories.  The BEA’s estimates of the 
effects of Hurricane Katrina on personal income are preliminary because insurance data are still not 
available.

equaled 4.7 months’ supply at September’s p ace—also at the high end of recent readings 
but a good bit below the hi storical average.  
 
Other recent indicators of homebuying activity have been mixed.  Although they remain 
low historically, both the thir ty-year fixed mortgage rate a nd the one-year adjustable rate 
have moved up a bit in recent months and are now about 40 and 75 basis points, 
respectively, above the levels  seen at the beginning of the year.  The Michigan SRC 
index of homebuying attitudes fell sharply in Se ptember and October to its lowest level 
since October 2000.  In contrast, the Mortgage  Bankers Association’s index of mortgage 
applications for home purcha ses remained elevated through early October.  The average 
price of existing homes sold in September was 10 percent higher than it was a year 
earlier, about the same increase as in the previous twelve-month period.  However, the 
average price of new homes has decelerated markedly over the past couple of months.  
 
Equipment and Software  
Real outlays for equipment and software appe ar to have been sluggish last summer.  
Nevertheless, a broad-based pi ckup in orders and shipment s of nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft in August may be pointi ng to a firming that would bring capital 
spending into better al ignment with relatively solid investment fundamentals—namely, 
continued expansion in business sales, a declin ing cost of capital, and corporate balance 
sheets that are flush with cash.  Surveys of ex ecutive sentiment currently square well with 
these fundamentals:  Although business leaders have expressed some misgivings about the overall macroeconomic environment, their stated capital spending intentions point to 
increasing investment. 
 
In the high-tech sector, recent orders and shipments data for computers, on net, point to moderate real spending gains.  Similarly, ea rnings reports from major software vendors 
have shown solid, though unspectacular, growth.  Real outlays for communications equipment likely expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, a development consistent 
with industry reports that telecom service prov iders had planned solid increases in capital 
spending for the second half of this year. 
 
Outside of a sharp strike-related drop in  aircraft investment, business spending on 
transportation has been well maintained.  Do mestic automakers, which account for the 
bulk of fleet sales, appear to have taken advantage of the pause in retail sales in August 
and September to speed up deliveries of light vehicles to businesses.   Sales of medium 
and heavy trucks were also st rong in September; in particul ar, the recent strength in sales 
of class 8 trucks, according to industry sources, may reflect some pull-forward in demand before new EPA regulations on engines take effect in 2007.  
 
Real business outlays for non-high-tech, non-tr ansportation equipment appear to have 
remained soft over the summer after having de clined modestly in the second quarter.  The 
most recent data, however, suggest that sp ending growth may be regaining traction ; 
August shipments of non-high- tech, non-transportation equipm ent advanced 1.4 percent,

and orders moved up 1.9 percent. Moreover, af ter having floundered ea rlier in the year, 
imports of this type of equipment rose 3.4 percent in August. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Although vacancy rates for nonres idential properties have con tinued to edge down, they 
remain elevated for office and industria l properties, and real spending on new 
construction has yet to markedly improve.  Th e vacancy rate for office buildings stood at 
12½ percent in the third quarter, about 2 perc entage points below its peak in the first 
quarter of 2004.  Construction in this sector, however, remains at a low level.  Spending 
on commercial buildings has also held stea dy at a low level since the middle of 2002, 
despite persistently high occupancy rates for th ese types of structures .  Furthermore, real 
construction outlays in the manufacturing se ctor dipped during the summer after having 
increased late last year.  
 
In contrast, in the drilling and mining sect or, the number of ga s rigs in operation 
continued to rise in September and, accordi ng to initial estimates from Baker Hughes, 
remained high in early October.  The number of rigs drilling for cr ude oil rose over the 
summer after some weakness last spring and is estimated to have held fairly steady after 
the recent hurricanes.  The Baker Hughes data , however, consider rigs to be operating 
unless officially confirmed lost or significantl y damaged; thus, the data may not yet fully 
reflect hurricane-re lated disruptions.13  
 
Business Inventories  
Business investment in real nonfarm inventories was relatively subdued over the summer.  
The book value of stocks held by the manuf acturing and trade sectors, excluding motor 
vehicles, increased in July and August at annual rates of $36 billion and $42 billion 
respectively.  However, a portion of the accu mulation was in the petroleum sector and 
probably related to the run-up in oil prices. 
 
Although inventory-to-sales ratios moved down some in July and August, businesses did not appear dissatisfied with th eir level of stocks.  For exam ple, September survey results 
from the ISM indicate that respondents vi ewed their customers’ current inventory 
situation as reasonably well aligned with dema nd.  Information from the staff’s flow-of-
goods inventory system suggests that inventory-consumption ratios rose in September.  
Excluding motor vehicles, however, much of the increase was concentrated in the 
chemicals and aerospace industries, in whic h hurricane- and strike-related shutdowns 
markedly decreased consumption.  Elsewher e—with the exception of paper—inventories 
remained well aligned with consumption. 
 
Federal Sector 
As a result of an exceptionally strong increa se in tax receipts in September, the fiscal 
2005 budget closed with a deficit of $319 b illion.  As recently as August, the  
                                                 
13 Less than 15 percent of active drilling rigs are locat ed in areas affected by the hurricanes.  Reports 
suggest that only a fraction of rigs in these areas were damaged.

Congressional Budget Office had projected a de ficit of $331 billion for the fiscal year.  
Legislative initiatives, particul arly spending for hurricane disa ster relief, continue to put 
some upward pressure on the deficit outlook. 
 
Tax receipts in September stood 18½ percent a bove the year-earlier le vel (after adjusting 
for payment timing shifts), boosted by a jump  of 46 percent in corporate income tax 
collections.14  September is an important month for corporate tax collections because of 
the quarterly tax filing deadlin e of September 15, and payments last month were much 
larger than they were in earlier quarters.  A portion of the surge in corporate receipts may 
reflect one-time payments on repa triated corporate foreign earnings.15  Nonetheless, 
quarterly payments for nonwithheld personal income and social insurance taxes were 
23 percent higher than they were a year earlier, also a larger increase than the one seen in 
earlier quarterly payments. 
 
Outlays in September, adjusted for shifts in payment timing, rose 12 percent from a year 
earlier, a significantly larger increase than fo r the fiscal year as a whole.  The acceleration 
in spending reflected an increase in outlays for disaster relief, Medicare, and defense.  
Disaster relief spending in September by th e Department of Homeland Security totaled 
$4 billion, an amount about $3½ billion higher than such spending in September 2004. 
 
For the fiscal year as a whole, receipts rose 14 percent, reaching 17½ percent of GDP, 
while outlays increased 7 percent, remaini ng around 20 percent of GDP.  As a result, the 
deficit fell from $413 billion in fiscal 2004 to $319 billion in fiscal 2005, or 2½ percent 
of GDP. 
 
The Congress continues to consider legislation related to hurricane relief.  In September, 
the Congress passed $62.6 billion in new budget authority for disaster relief, $2 billion in borrowing authority for the federal flood insu rance program, and $6 billon in tax cuts 
(over two years).
16  With regards to regular budget le gislation, little progress has been 
made on the annual appropriations bills and on th e two reconciliation bi lls to reduce taxes  
                                                 
14Last year’s receipts were held down by a tempor ary tax code provision that had allowed companies 
to delay payments of a portion of their corporate income taxes from September until October 
15 A provision in the American Jobs Creation Ac t of 2004, which allows a temporary, one-year 
deduction by corporations for earnings repatriated to U. S. parent firms from foreign subsidiaries, results in 
an effective tax rate of 5.25 percent on the repatriated earnings.  Th rough September, U.S. companies had 
announced plans to repatriate about $200 billion in foreign profits, which would yield about $10 billion in 
corporate tax revenue.  However, the timing of the paym ent of these taxes during the year is uncertain.   
16 In September, the Department of Energy sold 11 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve (at an average pri ce of $63.85 per barrel).  In addition, exchange agreements––which 
are in-kind loans of oil that are paid back with oil– –were reached for 13.2 mil lion barrels, although the 
amount was later reduced to 10.8 million barrels at the request of the contractors.  As of October 24, about 5½ million barrels of oil had been delivered from the sale agreements, and almost 9½ million barrels had been delivered from the exchange agreements.  Dama ge done by Hurricane Rita reduced the rate at which 
purchasers have been able to take delivery of the oil and process it, so delivery is planned to continue through November.

and mandatory spending.  The Congress pass ed a continuing resolution on September 30 
to fund government programs normally covered under the annual appropriations bills 
through November 18. 
 
State and Local Government Sector 
Indicators of state and local government sp ending have posted moderate increases in 
recent months against a backdrop of improving financial conditions.  State and local employment rose 32,000 in September despite layoffs in New Orleans as a result of the 
closure of its schools after Hurricane Katrina.   Employment gains over the three months 
ending in September averaged 38,000, a pace more  than twice the one seen over the past 
year.  Nominal construction spending is now  estimated to have risen 0.7 percent in 
August and 0.5 percent in July.  These data are consistent with a small gain for the third 
quarter in the NIPA measure of real state and local investment in structures. 
 
Census data indicate that tax revenues at the state and local levels increased markedly in 
the second quarter.  For the year ending in June, state taxes were 8 percent higher than 
they were the previous y ear, as individual income ta x revenues surged.  Local 
governments experienced a 6½ percent increase in  tax revenues, led by a sizable increase 
in property tax payments (which account for about 75 percent of local revenues).  With spending rising moderately and receipts robust,  state and local finances continued to 
improve.  The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that general fund 
balances of state governments for fiscal 2005, which in general closed in June, were 
higher than expected; the increas e reflects the surge in tax receipts.  The balances of the 
forty-six states included in the survey reached 7 percent of spending, somewhat above the average level seen over the past 20 years.
17  Looking toward fiscal 2006, these states have 
budgeted an increase of 5¾ percent in genera l fund spending.  According to the survey, 
new legislation is expected to boost revenues ½ percent on net, as increases in tobacco 
taxes outweigh small cuts to  personal income taxes. 
 
Prices  
Soaring energy prices boosted overall measur es of consumer price inflation during the 
past three months.  However, recent measures of core consumer price inflation have been 
much more restrained.  Although the aggreg ate CPI rose 1.2 percent in September—the 
largest monthly increase in 25 years—core cons umer prices rose just 0.1 percent for the 
fifth straight month.  The late st figures left the estimated twelve-month change in core 
PCE prices at 1.9 percent, essentially the same  as in the year-earlier period.  In contrast, 
we estimate that overall PCE prices increased  3.7 percent over the twelve months ending 
in September, compared with 2.4 percent a year earlier.18   
 
                                                 
17 Year-end balances are the sum of rainy day funds and cash-on-hand. 
18 The August figures for PCE prices in the table and charts correct a mistake in BEA’s published data 
for truck prices.  Core PCE prices were reported to have increased 0.2 percent in August, while the 
corrected figure rounds down to 0.1 percent.

II-36 
The CPI for energy rose 12 percent in Septembe r, after increases of  5 percent in August 
and 3.8 percent in July.  Motor fuel prices ju mped almost 18 percent in September, by far 
the largest monthly increase on record in that category.  The CPI for natural gas also 
increased considerably, although much of the sh arp run-up in spot prices has not yet been 
passed through to consumers, probably because of lags in rate adjustments by some state 
public utility commissions.  Over the twelve  months ending in September, the CPI for 
energy increased 35 percent, a jump far exce eding the approximate 7 percent rise posted 
over the previous twelve months. 
 
The food component of the CPI increased 0.3 pe rcent in September after no change in the 
previous month.  This pickup reflects pri ce increases for meats and vegetables, which 
reversed the previous month’s declines.  Compared with twelve months earlier, consumer 
food prices increased 2.5 percent,  down ¾ percentage point rela tive to the previous year.  
The hurricanes had little effect on food and agricultural markets.  However, favorable export prospects have lifted prices for wheat over the past few weeks, while unexpectedly 
strong harvest estimates have eroded the pri ces of corn and soybeans.  Transportation 
disruptions associated with the hurricanes were  short-lived and do not appear to have had 
any lasting effect on crop prices, al though barge rates remain elevated. 
 
Excluding food and energy, consumer prices  have been quiescent.  Prices of 
transportation services––which are especially energy intensive––have increased noticeably over the past year after having held steady during 2004.  In September, however, the only hint of a pass-through of hi gher fuel prices to the core CPI was an 
increase of 1.1 percent in the CPI category for delivery services.  Pric es for airfares and 
other intercity transportation were reported to have declined  for a second month despite 
sharp increases in the prices  of jet fuel and diesel. 
 
PCE prices of core consumer goods are estimated to have ch anged little over the twelve 
months ending in September and to have declined at an annual rate  of about 1 percent 
from three months earlier.  Some of this r ecent softness reflects the automakers’ discount 
pricing schemes, which have now expired.  We estimate that PCE prices of core services 
rose about 2¾ percent between September 2004 and September 2005; the figure is about 
½ percentage point less than the year- earlier reading and reflects a noticeable 
deceleration in shelter prices.  On balance, core PCE prices have increased an estimated 
1.9 percent over the twelve months ending in September, little changed from the 
2.0 percent increase over the previous year.   
 
Inflation expectations have moved higher, pres umably in response to rising energy prices.  
As measured by the preliminary October rel ease of the Michigan SRC survey, median 
expectations for inflation over the coming year  rose to 4.6 percent––well above the 3 to 
3¼ percent readings that had prevailed over the spring and summer.  However, median 
expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years remained at 3.1 percent in early 
October, only a little above the average range re ported in recent years.  As noted in the 
financial section of Part II , rate spreads on CPI-indexed Treasury bonds as of October 24 
implied inflation compensation near 2.6 percen t over both the next five and ten years,

about the same as in mid-September and n ear the middle of the range observed over the 
past year. 
 
The PPI for capital equipment increased 0.3 pe rcent in September after having declined 
0.1 percent in August.  Over the twelve mont hs ending in September, capital equipment 
prices rose 2.3 percent, comp ared with an increase of 1.7 percent during the year-earlier 
period and little change over the two previous years.  This year’s pickup occurred mainly 
in the prices of heavy trucks and th e catchall category of  non-high-tech, non-
transportation capital equipment. 
 
Although Hurricane Katrina had little apparent e ffect on the core CPI or the core PPI for 
finished goods, it appears to have had a substa ntial effect on prices at earlier stages of 
processing.  Producer prices for core intermed iate materials rose 1.2 percent last month 
after four months of small de clines, with prices of industr ial chemicals, fertilizers, and 
plastics––all energy-intensive intermediate ma terials––picking up notably.  Also, prices 
for nearly all types of building materials in creased substantially; plywood prices rose 
14 percent, and prices of cement, concrete, a nd asphalt all rose about 1 percent.  Despite 
the September increase, prices of core inte rmediate materials moved up just 3½ percent 
from a year earlier, 4 percentage points less  than the increase over the preceding year.   
 
Movements in commodity prices have been  mixed since the September Greenbook.  Steel 
scrap prices have fallen noticeably, while spot  prices of copper and building materials 
have risen sharply.  Since the Septembe r Greenbook, the Journal of Commerce metals 
index has fallen 3.3 percent, while the CRB spot industrials index, which excludes 
energy, has picked up 1.1 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview  
Interest rates rose appreciably over the intermeeting period, reflecting an easing of 
investors’ concerns about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic activity, data 
releases that were on net a bit stronger th an the market had expected, and comments by 
Federal Reserve officials that were interprete d to suggest that more  substantial tightening 
would be necessary to contain inflation risk s.  The increase in nominal interest rates 
seemed to represent primarily a rise in the ma rket’s outlook for real rates, as measures of 
inflation compensation based on TIPS yields did not change materially, on net.  A few 
high-profile credit events—inc luding bankruptcy filings in th e airline and auto sectors 
and the revelation of fraud at a major deriva tives dealer—garnered c onsiderable attention 
in the press but apparently left  little imprint on market func tioning or asset prices more 
broadly.  Amid higher interest rates a nd cautious guidance from companies about 
expected earnings, stock prices fe ll about 3 percent over the period. 
 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields  
Short-term interest rates rose slightly following the announcement that the FOMC had 
raised the intended federal funds rate 25 basi s points at the September meeting; market 
participants had placed some odds on a pause in the tightening cycle.  Policy expectations 
rose further over the intermeeting period in resp onse to data releases that confirmed that 
the economy had been on a solid growth track  before the hurricanes and to signs that 
disruptions from Katrina were less severe than had been fear ed.  The market reaction to 
the incoming data likely was colored by comme nts from Federal Reserve officials that 
were seen as hawkish on inflation, although the fall in oil prices over the period may have 
tempered inflation fears somewhat.  Judgi ng from federal funds futures, investors 
currently place a 95 percent probability on a quarter-point tighteni ng at the November 
FOMC meeting and now expect a federal f unds rate of about 4½ percent by next 
summer—up from a bit over 4 percent just before the September meeting.  Uncertainty about the future path of policy implied by options on Eurodollar futures diminished over 
the period, but remains above the level of late August.  
 In line with the increase in near-term policy expectations, nominal Treasury yields rose 
30 to 45 basis points over the in termeeting period, with the largest increases at shorter 
maturities.  A good part of the rise in Treasur y yields occurred in the first half of the 
intermeeting period, with noticeable responses  to better-than-expect ed data on initial 
claims and from surveys of manufacturing activ ity.  TIPS yields rose about in line with 
their nominal counterparts.  As a result, in flation compensation over the next five years 
and five to ten years ahead was little change d, on net, as investors evidently viewed the

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock market indexes declined 2 to  4 percent over the intermeeting period in 
response to the rise in long-te rm interest rates and to some  concerns about profits going 
forward.  Energy stocks posted some of the larg est drops because of the fall in oil prices 
over the period.  Declines were also relatively  large for segments of the market that tend 
to be more sensitive to interest rates, such as small companies, utilities, and REITs.  The 
ratio of trend earnings to share prices fo r S&P 500 firms—a measure of expected long-
run real equity returns—has remained near  5½ percent, where it has hovered since early 
2004.  As a result, the rise in the long-run re al Treasury yield indicated a slight narrowing 
of the long-run real equity premium.    Implied volatilities for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose a bit over the intermeeting period, although these measures of equity market  risk remained relatively low.  As broad 
indexes of corporate yields increased about in  line with Treasuries, risk spreads on bonds 
were little changed.  Bankruptcies in the ai rline sector and the revelation of accounting 
fraud at Refco, a large derivatives broker, di d not appear to have any lasting effect on 
bond spreads; however, the bankruptcy filing of a major auto parts firm did lead to some 
increase in spreads in the auto sector.  Risk spreads on thirty-day commercial paper 
remained in a fairly low range.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
The third-quarter earnings season has been re latively uneventful to date, with the news 
about the third quarter, including insurance co mpanies’ reported losses from Katrina and 
Rita, coming in close to e xpectations.  With about 250 of the S&P 500 firms having 
reported, earnings per share for the S&P 500 are estimated to have come in nearly 
15 percent above the year-ago level, an incr ease boosted almost 7 percentage points by 
growth at energy firms.  At the same time,  forward-looking guidance has been cautious, 
and expectations for earnings in the year ahea d, outside of the energy sector, were revised 
down a bit through mid-October.  Outside the airline and auto sectors, fi rms’ credit quality—boosted by continued 
profitability, relatively low leverage, and high liquidity—r emained strong.  Ratings 
changes in the auto and airline sectors pus hed up the overall rate of bond downgrades in 
the third quarter; apart from th ese troubled sectors, bond downgrades have been modest.

The bond default rate moved up in September and is expected to tick up again in October 
on the filings of Delta and Northwest Airlines and major auto parts supplier Delphi.  The timing of these filings likely was pulled ahead in order to avoid changes in the 
bankruptcy code that took effect on Octobe r 17.  The expected one-year-ahead default 
rate based on estimates from KMV Corporation remains low.  
Business Finance 
Overall, the pace of net debt financing app ears to have been moderate over the past 
couple of months.  C&I lending has continued to be particul arly strong, consistent with 
reports from the Senior Loan  Officers Opinion Survey that standards and terms on these 
loans were eased somewhat furthe r over the past three months.
1  In contrast, commercial 
paper outstanding only edged up over the peri od, and bond issuance has been modest of 
late, as higher yields apparently ha ve discouraged new longer-term issues. 
 Boosted by a substantial seasoned offering fr om Google, gross public  equity issuance 
ended the third quarter rather strongly but has waned a bit in  October with the softening 
in the equity market.  Regist rations of new offers with the SEC have slowed after having 
surged in the middle of the year, an indicat ion that gross equity issuance will likely 
remain moderate into the winter.  Equity re tirements related to mergers ballooned in the 
third quarter because of strong merger activit y, including several large leveraged buyouts.  
Moreover, announcements suggest that share re purchases continued to be very robust in 
the third quarter.  Taken toge ther, gross equity issuance a nd retirements suggest that 
outstanding net equity decrea sed by more than $35 billi on per month during the third 
quarter—a pace that exceeds the rapid contrac tion of the late 1990s.  However, compared 
with firms in the late 1990s, firms current ly are less leveraged and have larger cash 
positions, mitigating concerns about a deterioration in credit quality. 
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt in the third quarter is estimated to be about 13 percent above 
its level of a year earlier.  Gross issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities 
(CMBS) was elevated in the third quarter, and the CMBS issuance calendar currently shows that a record volume of deals may close in the fourth quarter.  The surge in supply 
of late has been associated with a modest  increase in CMBS spreads.  In addition, 
concern about lax underwriting standards has le d at least one rating agency to increase 
the amount of credit support required to achie ve a given rating.  Nonetheless, market

indicators do not point to a broad incr ease in credit risk.  Delinquency rates on 
commercial mortgages at banks and on CMBS  have continued to trend down, and 
delinquencies on commercial mortgages at in surance companies remain low.  Data on 
vacancy rates and rents through the third quarter  point to continued improvement in real 
estate market conditions.    
Household Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the thirty-year fi xed mortgage rate in creased about 30 basis 
points to 6.1 percent, its highe st level since the summer of 2004.  Mortgage debt in the 
second quarter was 13 percent above its leve l a year earlier.  Although refinancing 
activity has tapered off recently in response to higher rates,  low rates thro ughout most of 
the summer suggest that grow th of mortgage debt likely remained strong in the third 
quarter.  In contrast, consumer credit ha s continued to expand only moderately:  The 
August figure was just 4 percent above its leve l of a year earlier.  Growth in overall 
household debt outpaced that of disposable  income in the second quarter, and the 
financial obligations ratio tic ked up again but remains below its peak reached earlier this 
decade.  Personal bankruptcy filings have surged to unpr ecedented levels.  Filings are estimated to 
have exceeded 500,000 in the week before the implementation of the much-publicized bankruptcy reforms on October 17.  This figur e included a large number of filings that 
had been made over the weekend just before the new law went into effect but may not 
have been processed by the courts until the following week.  Estimates of the number of filings after October 17 point to  a sharp drop, an indication th at most of the recent surge 
of filings was likely pulled forward from future months.
 2  Most delinquency rates for 
consumer loans have remained low in recent months and do not point to a deterioration in 
household credit quality.  By itself, the net gain in stock prices over the third qua rter would suggest a slight 
increase in household net worth.  Despite th e rise in stock prices last quarter, net 
purchases of equity mutual funds were moderate in August and September; domestic equity funds had net outflows while bond f unds had relatively strong net inflows.  
                                                
 
2 Financial distress related to the hurricanes does not appear to have contributed to the rise in personal 
bankruptcies; data from the affected areas roughly track national patterns once adjustments have been made 
for disruptions stemming from courts being temporarily closed.

Treasury and Agency Financing  
The federal budget’s surplus in September re flected particularly strong corporate tax 
receipts.  During the intermeeting period, th e Treasury auctioned two- and five-year 
nominal coupon securities and five- and ten-y ear TIPS, and on balance the auctions were 
well subscribed.  Indirect bidder participati on—an indicator of demand by foreign official 
institutions—was above its recent average.  Fannie Mae’s stock price fell 3 percent during the period as more evidence of accounting 
inadequacies was revealed.  Freddie Mac’s sh are price, supported by news of a proposed 
share buyback, ended the period up 1 percent.  Agency debt spreads over comparable-
maturity Treasuries are roughly uncha nged since the last FOMC meeting. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of municipal securities, supported by strong issuance of both new capital 
and refunding bonds, remained elevated in th e third quarter.  However, refunding issues 
have slowed significantly in October as inte rest rates have moved higher.  The credit 
quality of municipal bonds has remained stable, as ra ting upgrades have just outpaced 
downgrades so far this year.  To date, no municipal bond rating dow ngrades have been 
specifically related to th e hurricanes in September, although some bonds from the 
affected region are still on Moody’s watchlist.  The ratio of yields on high-grade general 
obligation municipal bonds to those on comp arable-maturity Treasuries, an additional 
measure of credit quality, was also li ttle changed over the intermeeting period.  
 
Money and Bank Credit  
In September and October, growth of M2 averaged 6½ percent at an annual rate — 
somewhat above the pace register ed earlier this year.  The st aff estimates that the effects 
of Hurricane Katrina contributed about 1 perc entage point to the growth of M2 in 
September; in particular, currency expa nded, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency delivered relief payments to indi viduals, and insurance companies advanced 
funds to hurricane victims against likely future  settlements.  For September and October, 
overall M2 growth was boosted by a turnaround in the volatile retail money market fund 
component and an uptick in growth of liquid deposits.    After having surged in August, growth of bank credit dropped in September to an annual 
rate of 5 percent.  A marked decline in banks’ lending to households accounted for the 
bulk of last month’s slowdown.  Growth of residential mortgage loans on banks’ books 
slowed sharply, in part as a large volume of  mortgages was securitized.  In addition,

home equity loans contracted in September,  likely reflecting the continued rise in the 
floating rates on such loans.  Growth of banks’ consumer loans fell back from the 
outsized pace in August to the range seen ea rlier this year.  By comparison, commercial 
real estate and C&I loans e xpanded notably last month.

In August, the value of exports of goods a nd services increased 1.7 percent from a strong 
July level.  The increase was largely driven by higher merchandise exports, although 
exports of services also adva nced a bit.  Most major categories of merchandise posted 
gains in August, with capital goods, automo tive products, and industrial supplies showing 
particular strength.  Within capital goods, exports  of aircraft recorded  the largest absolute 
gain, but semiconductors, computers, and te lecommunication products also rose.  In 
contrast, exports of agricultural products fell.   The average value of exports in July and 
August increased 5¾ percent (a.r.) from the second quarter.  Exports of capital goods 
(particularly aircraft) and automotive products  exhibited particular ly robust growth. 
 The value of imported goods and services rose 1.8 percent in August,  reflecting gains in 
non-oil goods and, more markedly, oil; imports of  services were little changed.  Within 
non-oil goods, imports of automotive products surged.  Imports of capital goods also rose, as an increase in imports of machinery offset a decline in ai rcraft.  Imports of 
industrial supplies and consum er goods retreated a bit.  The drop in consumer goods 
reflected declines in imports of apparel and textile products.  The average value of 
imports in July and August increased 5¾ percen t (a.r.) from the second quarter, more

than accounted for by a surge in oil imports as  non-oil imports droppe d sharply in July.  
Automotive products also grew robustly, but  imports of consumer goods and industrial 
supplies fell.    
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In September, BLS prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and core 
goods both increased 1.2 percent, led by a strong increase in the price of imported natural 
gas.  Core goods prices excluding natural ga s rose 0.6 percent, larg ely reflecting higher 
prices for material intensive goods, with chemicals and building supplies exhibiting 
particularly large increases.  Finished goods prices recorded  much more modest gains; 
prices of imported capital goods (excl uding computers and semiconductors) and 
consumer goods both increased 0.3 percent in September after declining slightly in the 
previous two months.  Prices of imported semiconductors fell 0.8 pe rcent in September, 
whereas prices of imported com puters declined 0.3 percent. 
 In the third quarter, BLS non-oil import pri ces climbed 0.3 percent at an annual rate, 
whereas the prices of importe d core goods increased 1.1 percent, a difference attributable 
to a 9.7 percent decrease in imported comput er prices and a 5.6 percent decrease in 
imported semiconductor prices.  The rise in  core goods prices primarily reflected a 
6.4 percent increase in prices of non-oil industrial supplies that was concentrated in 
September.  Prices of most other categories of imports fell in th e third quarter, with 
imported food prices declining 3.3 percent a nd the prices of consumer goods edging 
down 0.8 percent.   Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose  7.3 percent in September, reflecting a 
modest rise in the price of imported crude oil and much larger increases in the prices of 
refined petroleum products.  The average spot  price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) 
crude oil rose 1 percent in September to av erage about $65.50 per barrel.  The spot price 
of WTI reached nearly $70 pe r barrel at the beginning of  the month in the immediate 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, but then e dged down following the release of strategic 
stocks by the International Energy Agency a nd diminished demand by refiners.  The spot 
price rebounded somewhat due to  Hurricane Rita later in Se ptember, but has since eased 
to an average of $62.76 per barrel so far this month.  Nonetheless, prices remain elevated 
due to diminished oil producti on in the Gulf of Mexico and perceptions of a tight market 
going forward.  The spot price of WTI closed at $63.05 per barrel on October 25.

Exports.   In September, the prices of U.S. e xports of total goods increased 0.9 percent, 
and the prices of core exports increased 1.1 pe rcent.  The increase in export prices was 
largely due to a 3.6 percent increase in prices  for exports of non-ag ricultural industrial 
supplies, particularly for petroleum products and chemicals, which more than offset a 
1.4 percent drop in the price of agricultural pr oducts.  Other categories of export prices 
changed only modestly.  In September, prices of exported semiconductors fell 
0.3 percent, whereas prices of computers increased 0.1 percent. 
 In the third quarter, total goods export prices  increased 1.1 percent at an annual rate, 
whereas core export prices rose 2.5 percent,  with the price increase concentrated in 
September.  Within core goods, prices of non- agricultural industrial supplies showed the 
most pronounced increase in the third quarter, rising 6.7 percent.  Agricultural prices 
increased 2.1 percent.  Other categories in core goods saw onl y modest price changes.  In 
the third quarter, semiconductor export prices  fell 12.9 percent, and computer export 
prices fell 5.3 percent. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
Net foreign private purchases of U.S. securiti es continued strong in August (line 4 of the 
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) at $58 billion, led by unusually high 
net acquisitions of corporate debt securities  (line 4c).  There we re also substantial 
acquisitions of Treasuries (line 4a), while net foreign purchases of both equities (line 4d) 
and agency debt securities (l ine 4b) lagged.  For the first eight months of the year, net 
foreign private acquisitions of U.S. secu rities are well above last year’s pace. 
 Foreign official inflows (lin e 1) continued at a high leve l in August but remained well 
below the record pace of 2004.  For both the month and the year to date, China has accounted for the bulk of official inflows.  Japanese official holdings have decreased 
slightly during the year through August and we have seen almost no inflows attributable 
to the major oil exporting c ountries.  Partial and confiden tial data on custody holdings at 
FRBNY indicate very modest foreign acqui sitions during September and moderate 
inflows thus far in October.    It should be noted that both the monthly transactions data and the annual holdings 
surveys may record some foreign official infl ows as private if inve stments are made via 
foreign private intermediaries.  Thus, the private inflows report ed above are likely 
overstated and the official inflows corres pondingly understated.  Th is could help to 
IV-7 
account for the very modest increase in offici al holdings attributed  to the oil exporting 
countries.    U.S. residents reduced their hold ings of foreign securities (line 5) slightly in August, with 
strong net purchase of foreign equities (line 5b)  offset by even larger net sales of foreign 
bonds (line 5a).  U.S. resident s showed a particular appetite  for Japanese equities in 
August, increasing their holdings  by $7 billion during the month. 
 The volatile banking sector (lin e 3) registered a modest out flow in August that roughly 
offset a similar inflow in July.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The major currencies index of  the dollar rose about 1 ⅓ percent on net over the 
intermeeting period.  This rise occurred as dol lar-denominated interest rates rose more 
than those of currencies of th e other major industrial economie s.  Late in the period, the 
dollar retraced some of its earli er gains as Treasury yields fell  while European yields rose 
following confidence survey data that was si gnificantly stronger than expected in 
Germany but was weaker-than-expected in the United States.  On net, long-term yields 
rose globally, as market partic ipants focused on comments from policy makers in several 
major economies that were interpreted as indi cating that upside risks to inflation might 
necessitate some firming of monetary polic y.  Energy prices spiked up early on in the 
intermeeting period on the landfa ll of Hurricane Rita, but declined later as concerns over 
the long-term damage caused by the hurricane  moderated and market reports indicated 
that U.S. demand for petroleum products was so ftening.  Even so, energy prices remained 
near historically elevated levels.  Major equity indexes generally declined across the 
globe, driven in part by the rise in gl obal bond yields. The exception was Japan, as 
market participants continued to discuss signs  of progress in Japanese economic recovery 
and in financial sector reform.

The dollar appreciated 3¾ percent on balan ce against the Japanese  yen, about 1½ percent 
against sterling, but less than 1 percent agains t the euro and the Canadian dollar.  The 
dollar appreciated in reaction to a widening of interest rate differentials against the yen- 
and sterling-denominated assets in favor of  the dollar.  Federal Reserve officials’ 
commentary highlighting inflati on concerns was generally inte rpreted as indicating that a 
greater-than-previously-anticipated degree of  monetary tightening was forthcoming.  The 
underperformance of the yen against the dolla r also appeared to owe to Japanese 
private-sector outflows that did not appear  to be driven by economic fundamentals. 
                    Only short-term Canadian dollar interest rates nearly kept pace with the rise in short-term 
dollar denominated rates, rising over 20 basis points during the intermeeting period.  The 
Bank of Canada further tightened its moneta ry policy stance, rais ing its policy rate 
another 25 basis points, to 3.0 percent, on Oc tober 18.  Three-month euro interest rates 
rose only slightly on net, despite statements  by European Central Bank President Trichet 
and other officials that highlig hted inflation concerns. Yields  implied by sterling interest 
rate futures currently show that market participants have reduced the odds of an 
additional 25-basis-point cut by the Ba nk of England through next year.

While short-term interest rates rose more moderately in non-dolla r currencies, global 
benchmark long-term yields rose around 30 ba sis points in the euro area as well as in 
Canada, and close to 20 basis points in Japan, as market pa rticipants focused on global 
official commentary highlighting inflation risk s.  Yields on inflati on-indexed notes rose 
nearly as much as nominal yields, leaving inflation compensation measures only slightly

The rise in long-term yields contributed to  some downward pressure in global equity 
markets. Headline indexes in the United Kingdom dropped more than in U.S. equity 
markets, falling nearly 4 percent, while th e euro-area headline i ndex declined about 
IV-12 
2½ percent.  In contrast, Japanese equities  continued to breach multi-year highs, as 
market participants discussed the likelihood that economic recovery was firming.  The 
Topix banking sub-index gained over 10 percent, as the passage of the postal reform bill 
appeared to support sentiment over the outl ook for further financial sector reform.  
 In several emerging markets, equity market indexes declined, particularly late in the 
period, as the rise in U.S. interest rates reportedly reduced invest or demand for riskier 
assets.  Emerging market sovereign external  debt spreads over Treasuries were little 
changed on balance.  Although the Brazilian real gained nearly 2 percent against the 
dollar over the period, and the Me xican peso depreciated modes tly against the dollar, late 
in the period these currencies came under some pressure as market participants noted that 
expectations of additional monetary easing by the Mexican and Brazilian central banks, 
had begun to weigh on the exchange value of these currencies.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Rising energy prices led consumer  prices to run up in the twelve months to September in 
all major industrial economies, except Japan, where mild deflation persisted.  In the euro 
area, headline inflation jumped  to 2.6 percent, but core in flation remained moderate.  
Consumer price inflation in the United Ki ngdom rose to 2.5 percent, also pushed up by 
rising gasoline prices.  Headline inflation in  Canada surged to 3.4 percent, above the 
ceiling of the Bank of Canada’s  1-3 percent ta rget range. 
 Economic performance in the third quarter a ppears to have varied substantially among 
the foreign industrial economies.  In the United Kingdom, GDP growth declined to 
1.5 percent from 2 percent in the second qua rter.  In Japan, indicators of private 
investment and consumption were fairly fl at, pointing to a slowdown in the pace of 
economic growth.  In contrast, in the euro  area, recent figures for industrial production 
and retail sales indicate that the economy has improved from its disappointing second-
quarter performance.  In Canada, data on ex ternal activity and hous ing starts point to 
continued robust GDP growth  in the third quarter. 
 Monthly indicators suggest that economic activity in Japan  rebounded in August from a 
weak July, but third-quarter growth neverthe less appears to have stepped down from its 
rapid pace in the first half of the year.  In August, real household spending rose 
3.2 percent and retail sales rose 1.5 percent, but averages of both over July and August 
are below their second-quarter levels.  Industrial production rose 1.1 percent in August, 
bouncing back to the average level recorded in  the second quarter.  The external sector 
continued to contribute positively.  In July  and August, on average, real merchandise 
exports were 2.5 percent higher, while real imports were up 1.8 percent. 
 The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) Tankan business cond itions index for all firms rose one point 
in September from its level in June.  Cap ital spending projections for 2005 were revised 
upward slightly in the Tankan survey.  Sale s and profits forecasts were also revised 
upward, with large manufacturers now expec ting domestic sales to exceed exports, 
underscoring the resurgence in domestic de mand that has taken place this year. 
 Tokyo core consumer prices, which excl ude fresh food but include energy, fell 
0.4 percent in September from a year ago.  In August, nominal wages were up 0.4 percent 
on an annual basis, as the unemployment ra te edged back down to 4.3 percent after a 
temporary uptick in July, and the job-offers-to-applicants ratio remained at a thirteen-year 
IV-14 
high.  BOJ officials continue to state that  they expect twelve-month consumer price 
inflation to turn positive by the end of 2005.  Monetary policy was unchanged, but long-
term interest rates rose in the wake of comments by several BOJ officials that were 
interpreted as indicating that the Bank’s pol icy of quantitative easing might end in the 
first half of 2006.

Parliament approved Prime Mi nister Koizumi’s bills to privatize the postal savings 
system following the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) victory in the September elections.  According to the bills, in October 2007 Ja pan Post will be split into four stock 
companies which, under a holding company, will take over mail delivery, postal savings, life insurance, and the networ k of post offices.  The holding company must then dispose 
of its entire stake in the savings a nd life insurance comp anies by March 2017.  The plan 
will create the largest private bank in the wo rld; Japan Post currently has $1.8 trillion 
equivalent in deposits.  
 
In the euro area , recent data suggest that the pace of economic activity accelerated in the 
third quarter from its second-qua rter lull.  In August, industr ial output in the euro area 
IV-15 
rose for the third consecutive month, and th e pickup appears increas ingly broad-based.  
Industrial orders remained str ong in the euro area, especially  in Germany where orders in 
July and August on average were up more than 1 percent from the seco nd-quarter level.  
Household demand appears to have firmed.  Retail sales in the euro area rebounded strongly in August after dropping in July, and French consumption of manufactured 
goods in the third quarter was up almost 2½ percent from the second-quarter average.  
 Business confidence improved in  the third quarter.  The European Commission measure 
of industrial confidence in the euro area incr eased in September, recording the highest 
reading since February.  In September, the euro-area PMI for manufacturing rose well 
above the 50 threshold indicating expansion, reaching its highest level in seven months; 
the PMI for services moved up as well.  In October, the IFO measure of business climate 
in Germany jumped to 98.7, a five-year peak.  Consumer confidence, in contrast, has 
shown no sign of improvement in the third quarter.  Even in France, the overall 
household confidence indicator con tinued to slip in September. 
 Increasing energy prices have contributed to the ongoing deterioration of the trade 
balance.  In August, the euro-area trade account showed a defici t of $0.9 billion in 
August, the first monthly deficit since 2000.

Labor market conditions in the euro area ha ve remained weak.  The unemployment rate 
edged up to 8.6 percent in August and has fallen only 0.2 percenta ge point since the 
beginning of the year.  In addition, unit labor  costs have accelerated a bit, as labor 
productivity growth has fallen.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation jump ed to 2.6 percent in September from to 
2.2 percent in August.  Higher energy prices  contributed 1.2 percentage points to the 
headline figure.  In contrast, core infl ation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, 
remained moderate, edging up to 1.5 percent as administered pri ces for alcohol and 
tobacco were set higher .  In October, according to the preliminary estimate, German 
consumer prices rose 0.4 percent from the previous month and the twelve-month rate of 
inflation remained at 2.7 percent.  
 GDP for the United Kingdom  rose 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the 
preliminary estimate.  Total output from  production industries fell 2.4 percent as a 
24.2 percent drop in the mining and quarrying sectors more than offset a 1.6 percent 
increase in manufacturing output.  Services rose 2.4 percent, maintaining similar pace to 
that of the previous two quarters,  and construction grew 2.0 percent. 
 Business confidence rebounded from negative terri tory in the third quarter.  The PMI for 
manufacturing squeaked above the 50 mark in August and increased a bit further in 
September.  The PMI for services remained  essentially unchanged near its 2005 average 
of 55.  The PMI for construction activity rose to its highest mark of  the year surpassing 
57 in both August and September.  Month-to-month changes in house pr ices continue to be just s lightly positive.  According 
to the Nationwide Building Society index, th e twelve-month change of house prices was 
1.8 percent in September, down from 2.4 percen t in August.  The Halifax index of house 
prices showed a twelve-month increase of 3.7 percent in September, also down from 
4.1 percent in the previous  month.  Household net borrowing for house purchases 
remained stable in August.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price infla tion rose to 2.5 percent in September, well 
above the Bank of England’s 2 percent targ et.  For the third c onsecutive month, the 
largest upward impact on the CPI came fr om transport prices, pushed up by rising 
gasoline prices.  Gasoline prices increased 4.3 percent in September from the previous 
month.  In Canada , indicators for the third quarter s uggest that economic activity remained 
strong, although retail sa les slipped in August after two m onths of robust advances.  The 
composite index of leading indicators posted another solid improvement in September, 
with household spending continuing to dom inate.  Housing starts moved up strongly 
again in September after an August lull.  The nominal merchandise trade balance 
expanded in August for the fifth time in the pa st six months; much of the August increase 
was due to rising energy prices.  The value of manufacturing shipments, new orders, and 
unfilled orders all advanced strongly in A ugust.  Leading the expansion in shipments 
were the petroleum and auto industries.

In September, overall employment declined slightly, the first dip since January.  
However, gains in full-time employment conti nued to be impressive, and growth in full-
time positions has accounted for virtually the entire expansion in employment thus far this year.  The unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in September, matching a 30-year 
low. 
 
In September, the twelve-month rate of cons umer price inflation moved up to 3.4 percent , 
due almost entirely to upward pressure from  gasoline prices.  The twelve-month rate of 
core inflation, excluding the eight most volat ile components, remain ed at 1.8 percent.  
With inflation edging higher and the econom y operating at full capacity, the Bank of 
Canada increased its target for the over night rate 25 basis points for the second 
consecutive time, bringing the rate to  3 percent at its October meeting.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Indicators have varied across the devel oping economies, but on ba lance, point to a 
moderate pickup in economic activity in th e third quarter.  In Asia, acceleration in 
Chinese and Korean third-quarter GDP is tempered by a slowdown in some of the other Asian economies, particularly Singapore.  In Latin America, recent data suggest that the 
Mexican economy has not fully recovere d from its weak second quarter, while 
performance appears to have moderated from the strong second-quarter growth rates in 
Argentina and Brazil.  Inflation rates in most  of the emerging economies, with the notable 
exceptions of China and Mexico, have risen recently.  In many cases, these increases 
reflect a greater pass-through of higher crude oil prices to consumer prices following 
reductions in domestic fuel price controls.  The higher inflation has prompted several 
central banks in Asia to raise interest rates.  Chinese  real GDP rose 8.2 percent in the third qu arter, in line with staff expectations.  
The growth appears to have been broad-base d.  Investment accelerated in the quarter, 
retail sales growth remained in double-digit territory, and exports continued to grow 
rapidly.  Industrial production accelerated in  the last few months and was up more than 
3 percent in the third quarter.  While Chines e exports grew rapidly in the third quarter, 
the rate of growth slowed slightly, and impor t growth picked up a b it.  The trade surplus 
for the third quarter was roughly the same si ze as in the second quarter.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation slowed in recent months, as food prices held down overall 
inflation and state-controlled fuel prices were raised only minimally.

Recent data from Hong Kong  have been generally positive.  In September, the 
unemployment rate fell to its lowest rate in four years.  Reports indicate that Hong Kong 
Disneyland opened to large crowds and shoul d be a boost to growth.  Trade volume, a 
good indicator of activity in Hong Kong’s en trepôt economy, moved up in August.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation conti nued to edge up in recent months, but still 
remains low.

In Taiwan , industrial production rebounded sharply in August and September, more than 
offsetting the July decline, and new orders fo r electronics and other goods were also up.  
The unemployment rate inched down in recent months.  Exports surged to a new high in 
September, contributing to a sizeable monthly trade surplus.  Twelve-month consumer 
price inflation fell back some in September owing, in part, to a small decline in core 
prices.

Korean  real GDP accelerated 7.5 percent in th e third quarter, on the back of strong 
domestic demand, particularly private cons umption, and a robust pickup in exports. The 
most recent data suggest sustained high levels  of consumer and business confidence in 
September.  Exports of high-tech goods to the United States are down from recent peaks 
but sales to China are rising, and August hi gh-tech industrial production posted strong 
gains.  Consumer prices jumped in Se ptember reflecting surging food, fuel, and 
transportation prices.  Citing concerns over hi gher inflation due to persistently high oil 
prices, Bank of Korea raised  its target interest rate 25 basis points to 3.5 percent on 
October 11, ending an easing phase that had lasted more than three years.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries suggest that economic growth generally 
moderated in the third quarter.  In Singapore,  the advance estimate of third-quarter real 
GDP (unofficial) indicates a 3.2 percent expa nsion, down from 18 pe rcent in the second 
quarter.  A strong electronics PMI reading for the third qu arter suggests expansion in 
activity going forward.  Else where in the region, the av erage industrial production for 
recent months inched down in Malaysia, but was up in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand from the second-quarter level.  Recent trade data show the ASEAN economies 
continuing, on average, to run trade surplu ses.  However, the August trade balance 
deteriorated in Thailand owing to high impor ts of capital goods, and in the Philippines 
due mainly to a high import bill for fuel products.  Consumer price inflation continued to be  elevated in the region, reflecting higher 
imported energy prices, and in some countries , a reduction in fuel subsidies and higher 
food prices.  The exception is Singapore, where reductions in vehicle prices and 
accommodation costs earlier in the year contri buted to containing inflation.  Citing 
concerns over higher inflation, central banks  raised interest rates 100 basis points in 
Indonesia in early October, 50 basis point s in Thailand on October 19, and 25 basis 
points on October 20 in the Philippines following a similar rate increase in late September.

The Indian  economy surged in the second quarter and more recent data also point to 
robust conditions.  Output rose  11.6 percent in the second quar ter, with gains widespread 
across manufacturing and services.  Industria l production recovered somewhat in August 
from a weather-related dip in July, and recent confidence and sales indicators are 
positive.  Oil imports continue to widen Indi a’s trade deficit.  In addition, wholesale 
prices have accelerated recently, reflecting highe r oil prices and a reduction of some fuel 
subsidies in early September.  Citing concer ns over higher inflation, the Bank of India 
raised its short-term benchmark intere st rate 25 basis points to 5.25 percent on 
October 25.

In Mexico , recent data releases sugge st that the economy has not fully recovered from the 
weak second-quarter performa nce.  Although overall economic activity improved in July 
and August, industrial producti on and manufacturing output ha ve been weak on average 
in recent months.  Industrial activity was little changed in Ju ly from the previous month 
reflecting, in part, anemic performance in the auto industry, due to declining car and 
truck demand in the United States and so me retooling in Mexican plants.  The 
improvement in industrial produc tion for August, and reports from the auto industry in 
Mexico point to some recovery in activity. 
 Mexico’s twelve-month headline and core infla tion continued to decline in recent months 
as a result of the aggressive monetary po licy tightening by the Bank of Mexico (BOM) 
from early 2004 to March 2005.  In Septembe r, twelve-month headline inflation fell to 
3.5 percent, well within the 2-4 pe rcent target range, and core in flation (not shown) fell to 
3.2 percent.  Price regulations have prevented high international oil prices from passing 
through to domestic inflation.  The improved inflation prospects and a slowing economy 
led the BOM to begin easing policy in late August.  As a result, the rate on 28-day 
peso-denominated bills (Cetes), a widely used  measure of the monetary policy stance, has 
fallen from 9.6 percent in early Augu st to 8.9 percent in mid-October.

Data from Brazil  since the last Greenbook have been mixed.  Although industrial 
production rose about 1 percent in August, the increase was con centrated in a few 
industries, including refining (p etroleum and ethanol), and average production for July 
and August was down from the second-quarter le vel.  Retail sales for August were also 
weak.  The export sector has remained the bright spot, with Brazil on track to post a 
record trade surplus this year, due primarily to higher prices of e xported commodities.  A 
hike in vehicle fuel prices in mid-Septem ber led to a rise in monthly inflation, but 
inflation remained at 6 percent on a twelve -month basis.  Survey-based measures of 
inflation expectations have continued to decline with twelve-month ahead expected 
inflation falling to 4.7 percent in mid-October.  Indications of weakening economic activity and subdued inflation prompted the central 
bank to reduce its policy rate 25 basis point s in mid-September and again by 50 basis 
points in mid-October to 19 percent.  The s candals that have dominated the political 
agenda have continued, and in mid-October le d to the resignations of two more members 
of Congress.  Although the scandals have further delayed progress on tax and other 
economic reforms, fiscal and monetary discipline has remained tight.  Citing the commitment to fiscal responsibility, changes in the government’s debt structure, and a 
more competitive export sector, Moo dy’s upgraded Brazilian foreign currency-
denominated debt by one notch, from B1 to Ba3 on October 12.

In Argentina , real GDP jumped up at an annual rate  of 10 percent in the second quarter 
after a weak first quarter, on th e back of strong growth in consumption and investment.  
In the third quarter, average industrial pr oduction for July and August was up from the 
second-quarter level.  Twelve-month consumer  price inflation has moved up this year, 
reaching over 10 percent in September, well above the central bank’s informal target 
range of 5-8 percent for the end of 2005.  The central bank has continued to intervene to 
stem upward pressures on the peso.  In mid-September, the Argentine Congre ss passed the 2006 budget, which projects the 
consolidated primary fiscal su rplus next year to be 4 per cent of GDP, half a percentage 
point less than demanded in recent IMF statem ents.  Unlike in previous auctions this 
year, in its latest auction, the Argentin e government was unable to place bonds at an 
interest rate it was willing to accept.  As a result, the government began to search for 
alternative sources of funding.

In Venezuela , monetary and fiscal po licies have continued to be expansionary, supported 
by high oil prices.  Despite a fixed exchange  rate and price controls on many products, 
twelve-month inflation rose to 16 percent in September.   
 Around early-October, President Chavez attracte d attention when he asserted that the 
central bank had sold up to  $20 billion in U.S. Treasury securities to buy foreign 
currency-denominated assets and transferred the funds from the United States to the BIS.  
That assertion was promptly contradicted by an official from the central bank, who later 
IV-31 
modified his statement.  The central bank has not issued a statement to clarify the 
situation.  Treasury data indica te that Venezuelan public a nd private sector holdings in 
the United States amounted to about $25 billi on at the beginning of this year, of which 
$7 billion was held in the form of U.S. Tr easuries.  Total holdings had not changed 
through August.  Although $5 billion in short- term U.S. Treasuries were sold over the 
first half of this year, holdings of other s hort-term U.S. assets rose by a commensurate 
amount.
