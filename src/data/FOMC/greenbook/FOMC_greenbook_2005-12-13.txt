II-1                                                 Overview 
Incoming data suggest that economic activity is  expanding at a solid pace this quarter.  
Industrial production bounced back in October and appears to be headed for a sizable 
gain in November.  Likewise, the increase in private payroll em ployment of nearly 
200,000 in November indicates that the labor market is recovering smartly from the 
depressing effects of the recent hurricanes.  Sales of light motor vehicles have dropped 
back from the extremely high levels of th e summer, but other spending by consumers and 
businesses has been reasonably strong.  Although the housing sector has shown some 
signs of cooling, the level of construction and sales remains high.  The prices of refined 
petroleum products have retreated significantly, on balance, from their post-hurricane 
peaks.  However, spot prices of natural gas moved up further in early December and 
remain well above their year-ago level, setti ng the stage for sizable increases in home 
heating bills this winter.  Recent data on core  price inflation have been favorable despite 
some evidence of energy price pass-through.    
 
Energy Sector 
Energy producers in the Gulf of Mexico have made progress in repairing damage from 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  At this point, total domes tic crude oil production has 
recovered to 88 percent of its pre-Katrina le vel and natural gas production to 93 percent.1  
However, the recovery is ta king longer than had been expected; indeed, it has been 
significantly slower than th e recovery after Hurricane Ivan in 2004, when a similar 
amount of oil and somewhat less gas were shut  in.  The biggest remaining problem is the 
damage to the huge Mars platform in the Gulf of Mexico; it al one generates about 
4 percent of domestic crude oil extraction and is not expected to come back on line until 
the middle of next year.  
 
Much of the hurricane damage to oil refineries has been repaired, though these repairs are 
taking longer than expected.  Of the twenty Gulf Coast oil refineries shut down by the 
hurricanes, three are still out of service.2  Although a few other refineries around the 
country are shut down for normal maintenance, the Department of Energy reported that,  
 
1  In the Gulf, about 34 percent of crude oil production and about 27 percent of natural gas production 
currently remain shut in.  By comparison, at the time of Hurricane Rita’s landfall, all crude oil production 
and 80 percent of natural gas production were shut in.  Damaged onshore and near-offshore (that is, within 
3 miles of shore) production facilities also have recovere d.  After Hurricane Rita, almost all this oil and gas 
capacity in Louisiana was shut in.  Currently, however, less than half of Louisiana’s crude oil production 
capacity and about one-third of its natural gas capacity remain shut in.  
2 These three amount to roughly 5 pe rcent of U.S. refinery capacity.

II-4 
as of the week ending December 2, U.S. tota l refinery capacity utilization was running 
near 91 percent, about 1 percentage  point below pre-Katrina levels.  
 
Because U.S. energy production has been retu rning to normal and extra imports of crude 
oil and refined products have been readily av ailable, the supply of energy products has 
been ample.  On the demand side, the seas onally adjusted apparent consumption of 
gasoline and other refined products—which dropped roughly 2½ percent in September—
has returned to pre-Katrina leve ls as gasoline prices have declined.  In addition, unusually 
temperate weather through mid-November held down space-heating demand for natural 
gas and heating oil. 
 
As a result of these developments, petr oleum inventories have rebounded from their 
post-hurricane lows.  Crude oil stocks are now well above normal, and inventories of 
gasoline, heating oil, and some other refined products are comfortably within the normal 
ranges for the season; by contrast, inventories of diesel fuel are at the low end of their 
normal range.3  Natural gas inventories remained comfortably above seasonal norms in 
November.  However, unusually cold weathe r in early December likely caused natural 
gas inventories to fall back, a nd spot prices spiked in the week ending December 5.  If the 
winter were to be unusually cold, then tem porary local shortages of natural gas could 
arise.  If temperatures run at seasonal averages, however, inventories likely would be sufficient to meet space-heating demand.    
 
The bulge in crude oil inventorie s has contributed to a net dec line in spot crude oil prices 
of about $0.75 per barrel since the Octobe r Greenbook.  At the same time, wholesale 
markups for gasoline and heating oil fell back to the normal range as inventories of these 
products also recovered.  As both crude o il costs and wholesale markups have moved 
lower, rack prices of gasoline have fallen 16 percent since late October, and rack prices 
of heating oil have fallen 17 percent.4  Because declines in wholesale prices of gasoline 
are usually passed through to th e retail level over a period of one to six weeks, the sharp 
decreases in rack prices of gasoline caused only a 6 percent decline in retail gasoline 
prices in October; survey data point to a substantially larger retail decline in November.   
 
                                                 
3 Domestic refiners boosted the share of gasoline in the output mix of refined products immediately 
after the hurricanes to address the low level of gasolin e inventories at the time; since then, this share has 
declined only slightly. 
4 Rack prices are wholesale prices for oil products at bulk terminals. 
II-5 
For natural gas, plentiful invent ories and declining prices of co mpeting fuel oil resulted in 
a large decline, on balance, in the U.S. average spot price from its peak in early October 
to mid-November.  However, consumer pri ces of natural gas increased in October 
because in many states the regulated residential prices of natural gas are based on costs at the end of the previous month.  The huge net de cline in spot prices from early October to 
mid-November is thus likely to hold down c onsumer prices of natural gas for the month 
of November.  However, with the surge in  spot prices since mid-November, current 
consumer prices of natural gas are estimated  to be about 35 percent above the level of 
December 2004, and, as a result, households are facing a significant jump in home 
heating costs this winter.   
 
Labor Market Developments 
The labor market appears to be recovering from  the losses that occurred as the result of 
the recent hurricanes.  After a subpar ga in in October, private nonfarm payroll 
employment rose by nearly 200,000 in November, somewhat above the pace in the three months before September. 
 
By industry, construction employment ro se 37,000 last month, likely because of 
hurricane-recovery activity.  Employment at food service and drinking establishments 
also rose nearly 40,000 last month and revers ed about half of th e decline experienced 
over the previous two months.  Broad-base d gains in durable goods  industries pushed up 
manufacturing employment in November, and the related indu stries of temporary help 
services and wholesale trade experienced job growth as well.  El sewhere, significant 
increases occurred in professional and technical services an d in education and health 
services. 
 
Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls ticked down 0.1 hour, to 33.7 hours, in November but remained in the narrow 
range that they have occupied over the past  year.  The decline in the workweek pushed 
aggregate hours down 0.1 percent.   Still, aggregate hours la st month stood 0.2 percentage 
point above their third-quarter average. 
 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  held steady at 5.0 percent in November 
and has changed little, on net, since the spring.5  The labor force participation rate, at  
                                                 
5 According to responses to special questions in the household survey that were asked of individuals 
who evacuated their homes as a result of Hurricane Katr ina, the direct effect of Katrina on the measured 
unemployment rate appears to have been less than 0.1 percentage point in November.

66.1 percent, was unchanged.  Other household survey measures suggest some reduction 
of late in labor market slack.  The number  of employees working part time for economic 
reasons as a percent of employment has m oved down, on net, over the past two months, 
while the number of workers leaving their j obs to enter unemploym ent as a percent of 
employment—an indicator of individuals’ pe rceptions of job availability—has increased, 
on net, over this period. 
 
Among other indicators of slack in the labor  market, the four-week moving average of 
insured unemployment moved down to 2.78 m illion for the week ending November 19, 
about 200,000 above the levels immediately preceding Katrina but 85,000 less than the 
post-Katrina peak.  Both the Conference Board’ s job availability index and the share of 
firms reporting hard-to-fill job openings to  the National Federation of Independent 
Business’ (NFIB) moved up in November.  
 
The latest indicators of labor demand are c onsistent with a robust labor market.  The 
four-week average of initia l claims for unemployment insurance fell to 322,000 for the 
week ending November 26, a level similar to  that prevailing before Katrina.  Layoff 
announcements compiled by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., bounced back from a 
low October reading, but the average for the past two months was still below the average for the year before September.  Meanwhile , the three-month movi ng average of business 
hiring plans reported to the NFIB remained  close to recent highs in November, and 
individuals’ expectations of future labor market conditions—as measured by the 
Conference Board and the Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC)—moved up last month, largely reversing post-Katrina declines. 
 
The BLS reported that output pe r hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual 
rate of 4.7 percent in the th ird quarter.  Over the four quarters ending last quarter, 
productivity advanced 3.1 percent, up from the 2.2 percent pace registered over the preceding four quarters.  In the nonfinancial  corporate sector, output per hour rose 
4.7 percent over the most recent four quart ers, considerably a bove the 3.2 percent 
increase over the previous four quarters.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) bounced b ack in October and appears to have increased briskly 
in November after having been held down in  September by hurricanes and by a strike at 
Boeing.  Total IP rose 0.9 percent in Octobe r; about one-half of the increase was due to 
the resumption of commercial aircraft produc tion, and roughly one-fourth of the gain 
reflected recoveries in hurricane-related  industries primarily outside of energy.  
Manufacturing production surged nearly 1½ perc ent, but output at mines, which includes 
oil and gas extraction, slipped further in Oct ober after plunging more  than 8½ percent in 
September.  Utilities output fell for a fourth consecutive month in October, and weekly 
data suggest that utilities output contributed  little to the increase in November IP.   
 
The available product data for November sugge st that a sharp increase in oil and gas 
extraction and in refining likely contributed a bout ½ percentage point to the change in IP 
last month.  Outside of energy, the restarting of hurricane-idled facilities boosted output in October and appears to have  further lifted output in November; most prominently, the 
production of chemicals rose about 2½ per cent in October after falling more than 
5 percent in the previous month.
6  Output gains in other hurricane-affected industries—
such as parts of the food, rubber and plasti cs, and paper industries—also contributed to 
the increase in IP in October.   
 
Industry estimates suggest that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies dropped to an annual rate of 11.8 million units in November; the asso ciated decline in the production index for 
motor vehicles will reduce total IP in November about ¼ percentage point.  The latest  
                                                 
6 Hurricane Rita idled nearly half of petrochemicals capacity at the beginning of October.

production schedules for December suggest that assemblies will average 11.9 million 
units for the fourth quarter as  a whole, a decline of more than 200,000 units from the rate 
in the third quarter.  Despite the slower pace of production, dealer stocks of new vehicles 
are headed for a large increase in the four th quarter.  That increase should move 
inventories back into the range  generally targeted by the automakers:  Days’ supply at the 
end of October was about sixty-six days as  measured by a six-month moving average of 
sales.  The automakers’ initial plans for the fi rst quarter of next year call for assemblies to 
step down further to 11.6 million units. 
 
Elsewhere in transportation, co mmercial aircraft production at Boeing snapped back in 
October.  However, the company has decide d not to make up for the production lost 
during the September strike; as a result, prev iously scheduled deliv eries of commercial 
aircraft are essentiall y delayed by one month.7   
 
Output in high-technology indus tries rose 1.7 percent in Oct ober, a step down from the 
average monthly rate of 2½ percent during the third quarter but about the average 
monthly pace during the firs t half of 2005.  Production of  communications equipment 
continued to surge after increas ing at an annual rate of about 30 percent in the third 
quarter.  The output gains for communications  equipment, while broadly based, have 
been particularly strong for data networki ng equipment.  For the most part, industry 
reports continue to be positive.  However, the  CIO Magazine diffusion index for future 
spending on data networking equipment fell sh arply in October, and in November the 
index remained near the low end of its range over the past two years.  In contrast to 
communications equipment, growth in the output of computers and peripherals has 
slowed recently, even relative to the tepid pace of the past year.  Although unit sales and 
production of personal computers have held  up reasonably well, the product mix has 
shifted toward lower-end desktops and la ptops.  In addition, th e production of large 
servers dropped off markedly, although the out put of small and midsize servers was solid 
in the third quarter.  The composition of  semiconductor production has reflected the 
contrast between the output growth of com puters and that of communications equipment; 
rates of increase in the IP index for the mi croprocessor chips used in computers have 
been running well below the rapid pace of the index for other chips. 
 
                                                 
7 Nevertheless, Boeing intends to increase production su bstantially over the next couple of years, partly 
because of the introduction of the 787 Dreamliner.  By not boosting  scheduled production to make up for 
the output lost during the strike, Boeing is attempting to avoid the problems that occurred during its last 
major expansion:  Sales and production soared in 1997, but overtime charges, parts shortages, and 
late-delivery fees imposed large financial losses.

II-16 
In market groups excluding energy, motor ve hicles and parts, and high-tech products, 
business equipment output jumped more than 8 percent in October.  Much of the increase 
reflected the resumption of commercial ai rcraft production.  But excluding aircraft, 
production still rose substantially; oil and gas field machinery recorded a particularly 
large gain.  By contrast, the output of c onsumer goods remained weak in October, 
continuing the pattern evident in recent qua rters.  The output of construction supplies 
surged in both September and October, and some of the increase was likely related to 
rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast region.  Ma terials output also rose in October, partly 
because of the hurricane-related recovery in  chemicals output.  By stage of process, 
capacity utilization rates in Oc tober for both the primary and semifinished stages and the 
finished stage were only a touc h below their long-run averages.8  Because additions to 
capacity continue to be meager, a sust ained pickup in production could move the 
industrial operating rate to its long-term average fairly quickly.9  
 
The forward-looking indicators of  production remain indicative of solid, if unspectacular, 
increases in manufacturing output .  The three-month moving av erage of the staff’s series 
on real adjusted durable goods orders rose moderately in October.  The new orders 
diffusion index from the Institute for S upply Management (ISM) slipped a bit in 
November, but like the new orders indexes fr om most of the regional surveys, the ISM 
index remained at a level consistent with  further output gains in coming months.  
 
Motor Vehicles    
Smoothing through the large swings caused by the automakers’ temporary summer pricing programs shows that sales of light  vehicles averaged an annual rate of 
16.8 million units over the past five months, a pa ce little changed from that recorded in 
the first half of the year.  Sales plunged in October after the expiration of the employee 
discount programs, but the decline was widely forecasted after the summer spike, and sales in November rebounded to an annual ra te of 15.7 million units.  The pace of sales 
will likely advance further this month af ter the introduction of another round of  
                                                 
8 The annual revision of industrial production and capacity utilization was published in November, and 
revisions were generally small.  Capacity utilization for total industry in the third quarter of 2005, at 
79.7 percent, was 0.3 percentage point higher than previously reported.  Between the fourth quarter of 2000 
and the third quarter of 2005, industrial output increased about 1 percentage point more than previously 
estimated, and because capacity was revised up less than was productio n, operating rates are above those 
previously reported. 
9 Capacity growth may be restrained slightly by th e plant closures recently announced by GM.  If GM 
carries through with these plans, capacity in the light motor vehicle sector, currently 14.7 million units, 
would fall about 450,000 units by the end of calendar year 2006 and would decline another 275,000 units by the end of 2008.  In addition, in January Ford will announce details of a restructuring plan that the 
company has said will include several plant cl osures and deep cuts in its workforce.

aggressive incentives by the Big Three firms in an attempt to bolster their year-end totals.  
Weekly data indicate that the average incentive per light vehicle sold moved up to $1,650 
in the week ending November 27, well above the recent low of about $1,100 recorded in 
September.   
 
Forward-looking indicators suggest that vehicle demand will be fairly well maintained in 
the near term.  The Michigan SRC index of  car-buying attitudes ticked up in November, 
indicating that consumers’ buying perceptions have improved a bit from their recent 
lows.  Also, the fraction of Michigan surv ey respondents who cited high gasoline prices 
as the reason behind their pessimistic view s of buying conditions declined noticeably in 
November. 
 
Consumer Spending 
Although the dropback in motor vehicle sale s in recent months will likely hold down 
growth in total real consumer  spending this quarter, spending  outside motor vehicles is on 
pace for a solid gain.  Non-auto spending moved up notably in October after having edged down in September in response to the hurricanes.  Consumer  spending has been 
supported by an improving labor market, a stre ngthening of equity and housing prices, 
and a rebuilding of household purchasing power  due to the recent fall in retail energy 
prices. 
 
Excluding motor vehicles, spending gains in October were broad based.  Real 
expenditures on durable goods expanded, reve rsing some of the decline posted in 
September.  Outlays for nondurable goods, whic h rose briskly, were aided by a recovery 
in real outlays on gasoline.  At the same time, spending on services moved up despite a 
sizable fall in outlays for electricity services .  Further, early indi cations from retailers 
point to robust spending in late November and early December and suggest that the holiday shopping season is off to a decent start. 
 
The fundamental determinants of consumer sp ending, which were lack luster in the third 
quarter, appear to have improved of late.  Real disposable personal income firmed in 
October and looks to have increased furthe r in November, bolstered by improvements in 
the labor market and falling energy prices.  Continued brisk gains in home prices and a 
recent pickup in the stock market have strengthened household balance sheets and pushed up the ratio of household wealth to disposab le income.  The personal saving rate, which 
plummeted in August to -2.2 percent (partly because of the uninsured hurricane-related 
losses to income), moved up to -0.7 percent in October.

II-21 
Consumer confidence picked up some in N ovember after having been weighed down by 
high energy prices and the hurrican es during the late summer a nd early fall.  However, as 
indicated by surveys from the Michigan Su rvey Research Center and the Conference 
Board, confidence remains below levels seen duri ng the first half of th e year and is likely 
damping spending a touch. 
 
Housing Markets  
Despite the downbeat tone of many anecdotes and press report s, the available data show 
only limited signs of cooling in  the housing market.  Alt hough starts of single-family 
homes declined in October to an annual rate  of 1.70 million units, this pace was equal to 
the average level seen in the first half of the year.  In the multifamily sector, starts dipped 
to an annual rate of 310,000 units in October, only a bit below the aver age pace of the last 
few months.  New permit issuance for both single-family and multifamily homes also 
moved down in October, but the level of pe rmits and the backlog of unused permits both 
remained elevated, suggesting that housing starts will remain strong through the end of the year.   
 
New home sales jumped in October to an annual rate of 1.42 million units, the highest 
pace on record.  Nevertheless, the stock of new homes for sale moved up in October and 
represents 4.3 months’ supply at  October’s elevated sales pace , a level near the upper end 
of the range it has occupied since 1997.  In October, sale s of existing single-family 
homes declined but remained quite elevated, while inventories of existing homes for sale 
edged up.  
 
Mortgage rates have moved up significantly since midyear.  The rate on a thirty-year 
fixed-rate mortgage has increased about 75 basis points since June, and the rate on the 
one-year adjustable-rate mortgage has increa sed about 90 basis points.  Nevertheless, 
mortgage rates remain well below their levels of a few years ago. 
 
Other indicators of housing activity have turned down recently.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of mortgage  applications for home purch ases declined in November, 
and builders’ ratings of new home sales have also fallen off in recent months.  Moreover, 
the Michigan SRC index of homebuying attitu des fell significantly in September and 
October and bounced back only a little in N ovember; recent homebuying attitudes are at 
levels last observed in the early 1990s.

At the same time, prices of existing ho mes continue to increase rapidly.  The 
purchase-only version of the OFHEO price index, which controls for differences in 
quality by tracking repeat sales of the same  houses over time, was 11 percent higher in 
the third quarter than its year-ago level.  The constant-quality price index for new 
homes—which controls for changes in the ge ographic composition of sales, home size, 
and other readily measurable attributes—was up 7½ percent in the th ird quarter from its 
year-ago level.  The average price of exis ting homes sold in October was 11¼ percent 
higher than its year-earlier level, a sligh tly larger increase than the previous 
twelve-month rise.  The only house price meas ure that has shown any moderation is the 
average price of new homes sold, which has d ecelerated markedly since the beginning of 
the year. 
 
Equipment and Software 
Real outlays for equipment and software posted a solid gain in the th ird quarter, growing 
at an annual rate of about 11 percent.  Although business purchases of motor vehicles 
were weak in October and November, spending excluding motor vehicles appears strong 
this quarter:  Shipments of nondefense cap ital goods excluding aircraft moved up 
1.8 percent in October.  Business investme nt has been supported by robust growth in 
business sales and by ample financial resources in the corporate sect or.  Additionally, the 
cost of capital continues to d ecline as the relative prices  of high-tech equipment and, 
more recently, of motor vehicles have moved down.  The favorable investment climate is 
reflected in executive surveys, which generally  point to widespread, planned increases in 
capital outlays. 
 
Real spending on high-tech equipment and soft ware increased at an  annual rate of 
16 percent in the third quarter, and demand i ndicators for the fourth  quarter are positive 
on balance.  October shipments of comput ers jumped 6.3 percent; deliveries of 
communications equipment edged down 0.4 percent, but bookings surged 14.4 percent. 
 
After having increased at a ra pid pace in the previous two quarters, business purchases of 
motor vehicles appear to have moderated.  Fleet sales of light vehicles moved up to a 
record high level in the thir d quarter and have come off a bit since then.  In the 
commercial truck sector, sales of medium and heavy trucks (classes 5 to 8) edged down 
to 490,000 units in October, but the level was well within the range of values recorded 
over the past year.  The indicators of near-term truck demand suggest that sales will 
continue at a solid pace.  The three-month m oving average of new orders for medium and

heavy trucks increased in October.  Or der backlogs, although down from their peak, 
remained elevated through October. 
 
Real investment in non-high-tech, non-transportation equipment increased at an annual 
rate of nearly 5 percent in the third qu arter—a noticeable pickup from the sluggish 
½ percent pace registered in the first half of the year.  Shipments of this equipment type 
increased 1.4 percent in October, and booki ngs moved up ½ percent.  An important 
contributor to growth in th is category over the past two years has been construction 
machinery:  After pausing earlier in the year , real investment in construction machinery 
reached a new high in the third quarter, a nd nominal orders and shipments both posted 
increases in October. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Real expenditures on nonresidenti al structures rose at an average annual rate of about 
3 percent over the second and third quarters, primarily reflecting an increase in outlays on 
drilling and mining structures.  Outside this  category, spending on new construction has 
yet to gain traction, even though vacancy rate s in nonresidential properties have moved 
down a bit during the past two years.  The vacancy rate for office buildings stood at 12¼ percent in November, about 2 percentage poin ts below its peak in the first quarter of 
2004.  However, construction in this sector rema ins near the depressed levels of the past 
two years.  Similarly, spendi ng on commercial buildings has held steady at a low level 
since the middle of 2002 despite pe rsistently low vacancy rates in  this sector.  In addition, 
real construction outlays in th e manufacturing sector have flattened out after increasing a 
bit late last year.  
 
Outlays on drilling and mining st ructures, which rose at an annual rate of 18 percent in 
the third quarter, continue th e strong growth from earlier in the year.  Although the 
number of gas rigs in operat ion has edged down since October,  large increases in natural 
gas prices over the past year suggest that  expenditures on drilling and mining structures 
will continue to grow in the near term.10  
 
Business Inventories   
The book value of inventories held by the manufacturing and trade sectors increased 
$25 billion in the third quarter.  When measured in real terms, however, nonfarm 
inventories actually declined $6 billion.  The r unoff in the third quarter largely reflected a 
                                                 
10 Less than 15 percent of active drilling rigs are locat ed in areas affected by the hurricanes.  Reports 
suggest that only a fraction of these rigs were damaged.

paring of motor vehicle stocks.  Even excl uding motor vehicles, i nventory investment 
was relatively subdued.  While the lull in non -auto stockbuilding may have been merely 
an intentional pause after th e large restocking that busin esses undertook earlier in the 
year, it may also have reflected  stronger-than-expected sales in  the third quarter.  Indeed, 
survey data from the ISM indicate that an increasing number of firms believed their 
customers’ inventories were running too low in October an d November relative to the 
readings earlier in the year.  Moreover, the book value of inventories relative to sales for 
the combined manufacturing and trade sect ors excluding motor vehicles dropped in 
August and September.  In October, manuf acturers’ book-value inve ntories (the only 
inventory data received for the fourth qua rter) rose $32 billion at an annual rate. 
 
Information from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system sugge sts that, excluding 
motor vehicles, inventory-consumption rati os fell in October after increasing in 
September.  The rise in September was concentrated among chemicals and aerospace 
products, whose hurricane- and strike-relate d jumps were reversed in October. 
Elsewhere, inventories, with the excepti on of paper, remained well aligned with 
consumption. 
 
Federal Government Sector    
Recent data show the federal deficit continui ng to narrow as robust gr owth of receipts has 
more than offset large increases in outlays.  For the twelve months ending in October, the 
deficit was $308 billion, down n early $100 billion from a year earlier.  After adjusting for 
shifts in the timing of payments, receipts in  October were 14 percen t above year-earlier 
levels while outlays were up 8 percent; both are similar to the increases recorded in 
earlier months of this year.  Spending for national defense rose 5 percent, a slower pace than earlier in the year.  Outlays for em ergency preparedness and response (mostly 
disaster relief and expenditures less premiu ms for national flood insurance) remained 
elevated in October.

Just before the Thanksgiving recess, the C ongress passed a second c ontinuing resolution; 
set to expire December 17, it funds spending fo r the three appropriations bills that have 
yet to clear the Congress (Labor-HHS-Education, Defense, and the District of Columbia).  In addition, the House and the Senate each pa ssed spending and tax reconciliation bills, 
but they face uncertain outcomes because provisi ons in the separate versions of the bills  
                                                 
11 Outlays were $4 billion in both September and Oct ober, and daily data indicate that they will be 
even higher in November.  In 2004, these outlays were about $1 billion per month in September, October, 
and November.

A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, orwhen the first 3 days of a month are nonworking days.  Outlays for defense, Social Security,Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.  In addition,defense outlays have been adjusted to treat the timing of accruals for retiree health consistently.

are quite different.12  Also, the Congress cleared a bill to increase the borrowing authority 
of the national flood insurance fund.  This incr ease will allow hurricane-related claims to 
be paid but will force future increases in fl ood insurance premiums to repay the resulting 
increase in debt. 
 
State and Local Government Sector 
Real state and local purchases are off to a slow  start in the current quarter despite further 
signs of improvement in the sector’s fi scal position.  Employment rose an anemic 
8,000 per month, on average, in October and November, a pace only about half that 
recorded over the first nine months of the year.  As for construction, expenditures fell 
sharply in real terms in the third quarter afte r a strong performance in the first half of the 
year.  In October, construction spending rose  0.6 percent in nominal terms; this gain 
follows similar increases in August and Sept ember and suggests that real construction 
spending entered the fourth quarter on a gradual uptrend. 
 
The results of the November election point to some cooli ng of voters’ enthusiasm for 
tight controls on state spendi ng and taxes.  In California, voters soundly defeated an 
initiative that would have limited increases in state spending to the average rate of 
increase in revenues over the preceding thr ee years; the initiative would also have 
permitted the governor to reduce spending unila terally under certain circumstances.  In 
Colorado, voters approved a five-year suspensi on of the state’s stringent structure of 
fiscal constraints, which had been in place since the early 1990s and required the state to return to the taxpayers any re venue gains in excess of the sum of the rates of population 
growth and inflation.  As of now, Colorado will be able to spend these “excess revenues” on health care, education, tran sportation projects, and some pensions.  In the state of 
Washington, voters sustained a gasoline tax increase approved by th e legislature earlier 
this year. 
 
Prices 
Overall consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in October; this move  reflects small increases in 
food and core prices and a decline in energy pr ices.  Nonetheless, over the twelve months 
ending in October, PCE prices increased 3.3 percent, nearly ½ percentage point more 
than in the preceding year; this step-up reflected soaring energy prices over the past twelve months.  In contrast, core consumer pr ice inflation has remained fairly subdued:   
                                                 
12 The House version of the tax reconciliation bill has only cleared the Ways and Means Committee; 
the bill is slated for a vote by the full House on December 8.

II-36 
PCE prices excluding food and energy rose 1.8 percent over the twelve months ending in 
October, slightly less than in the preceding year. 
 
Consumer energy prices have started to recede.  The PCE price index for energy fell 
0.6 percent in October and reflects a sizable 4¼ percent decline in ga soline prices.  The 
PCE price indexes for both fuel oil and na tural gas increased in October.     
 
Core consumer price inflation remains mode rate, though some signs of a pass-through of 
higher energy costs are becoming evident, espe cially in transportation services.  The PCE 
price index for purchased intercity transpor tation (mainly airfares ) turned up 0.6 percent 
in October and rose 6.4 percent over the pa st twelve months after having declined 
5.7 percent during the previous  twelve months.  Some pass-through of energy costs was 
also evident in PCE prices for delivery se rvices and for moving and storage, though the 
weights of these two categories in the overall PCE price index are quite small. 
 
On a twelve-month change basis,  the slight step-down in the rate of core PCE inflation 
reflected a deceleration in the non-market comp onent of PCE prices, particularly in the 
index for imputed financial service charges.  The market-based component of core PCE 
prices increased 1.6 percent over the twelve months ending in Oc tober, the same as in the 
preceding year.  Changes in core goods prices  were near zero over the twelve months 
ending in October.  Prices of core market-b ased services increased  about 2.6 percent over 
this period, about the same as in  the preceding twelve months.   
  
Near-term inflation expectati ons declined sharply in Nove mber, presumably in response 
to receding energy prices.  As measured by the Michigan SRC survey, median inflation 
expectations for the coming year dropped mo re than 1 percentage point in November; 
still, year-ahead inflation expectations rema ined slightly higher than those in August.  
Median expectations for the next five to ten years remained about 3 percent for the third consecutive month—a touch above the narrow range observed in recent years.  By 
contrast, rate spreads on CPI-indexed Treasury bonds (as of December 6) implied inflation compensation just be low 2½ percent over both the ne xt five and ten years—the 
low end of the range observed over the past year. 
 
Most of the broader measures of inflation have  picked up a bit over the past four quarters, 
a reflection of higher ener gy prices.  Excluding food and energy, however, GDP price 
inflation this year has remained near last y ear’s 2½ percent rate, as  slower increases in 
II-37 
prices for residential investment  have offset faster increases in prices for state and local 
government purchases. 
 
Increases in energy costs have  pushed up producer prices in some sectors.  The soaring 
cost of diesel and jet fuel contributed to larg e increases in producer prices for air, rail, 
truck, and water transport servi ces in October.  In addition, core intermediate materials 
prices rose 1.2 percent for th e second consecutive month in Oc tober; the increase reflects 
the further pass-through of ener gy costs into the prices of energy-intensive products, such 
as chemicals, plastics, metals, and nitrogenate  fertilizer.  The prices  of several types of 
building materials, such as concrete, cement,  asphalt, and gypsum, increased sharply in 
October, a move possibly related to rebuildi ng efforts after the hurricanes and to high 
energy costs.  Still, notwithstanding the recent increases in core materials prices, the PPI 
for intermediate materials has decelerated near ly 4 percentage points in the past twelve 
months relative to the preceding twelve-month period. 
  
Changes in non-energy commodity prices sinc e the October Greenbook have been mixed:  
Prices of steel scrap and copper have surge d, while prices of plywood and oriented strand 
board fell sharply after posting very large in creases in August and September.  Over the 
past six weeks, the Journal of Commerce me tals index has risen 11.2 percent, and the 
CRB spot industrials index (which ex cludes energy) increased 0.2 percent. 
 
Labor Costs   
Over the three months ending in September, the employment cost index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation in private industry rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent—a bit faster than in 
the first half of the year.  Nonetheless, September’s twelve-month increase was only 
3 percent, well below the 3.7 per cent increase of a year earlier.  Another measure of labor 
costs—compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector—has been buffeted by transitory factors since late  last year but, on balance, has shown some moderation in 
growth since then.  
 
The wages and salaries component of the ECI ro se at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the 
third quarter, a reading unchanged from the tw o previous ones for this year.  Monthly 
increases in average hourly ea rnings of production workers we re similarly restrained for 
most of this year and aver aged about 3 percent at an annual rate from March through 
September.   However, this indicator has in creased more rapidly so far in the fourth 
quarter, rising at an average monthly rate  of 0.4 percent in October and November.

The benefits component of the ECI increased at an annual rate  of 5.2 percent in the third 
quarter, a faster rise than experienced in the first half of the year.  Nonetheless, over the 
past twelve months, the increase in benefits  costs (4.8 percent) was 2 percentage points 
slower than over the preceding twelve mont hs, when benefit costs were swollen by a 
surge in outlays for retirement and savings plans. 
 
In the ECI release, employer contributions fo r health insurance are estimated to have 
risen 6¾ percent over the twel ve months ending in September—about the same as the 
previous year but well below the 10 pe rcent yearly increases in 2002 and 2003.  
Available indicators provide no evidence that a sharp change in the rate of increase is in 
the offing.  Private surveys suggest that prem iums will rise about 7 percent to 10 percent 
in 2006, increases similar to the survey results for 2005.  Among the major plans for 
public employees, OPM expects premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to rise 6½ percent, on average, in 2006 after a rise of 7½ percent in 2005.  Premiums for the California Public Retirement System are slated to increase 9 percent, on 
average, in 2006 after a c limb of 10 percent in 2005. 
 
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business s ector increased at an annual rate of 
3¾ percent in the third quarter.  In addition, the inco rporation of new stat e UI data caused 
the second-quarter increase in compensation per hour to be revised down sharply to an 
annual rate of 0.9 percent.  This low figure appears to indicate that the unwinding of the transitory factors—bonuses and exercises of stock options—tha t led to a sizable gain in 
compensation in the fourth quarter of last y ear is largely complete d.  Averaging through 
these transitory factors, compensation grow th seems to have slowed a bit recently.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Most market interest rates changed little, on balance, over the inte rmeeting period, as the 
effects of better-than-expect ed data on spending and out put were offset by benign 
incoming data on core inflation and communicat ions from the FOMC that were perceived 
as optimistic about inflation prospects.  On  net, market participants revised up only 
slightly the expected path of monetary  policy through 2006, though some notable swings 
occurred over the intermeeting period.  Equity markets ralli ed on the perception that the 
economy has substantial momentum w ith limited inflation pressure.   
 Household and business credit quality app ears to have remained favorable.  Net 
borrowing by nonfinancial businesses stayed moderate in October and November, and 
cash-rich firms are estimated to have been re tiring equity at a near-record pace.  Home 
prices advanced again at a doubl e-digit annual rate in the th ird quarter, sup porting robust 
growth in household mortgage debt.    
Policy Expectations and Treasury Interest Rates 
The decision at the November FOMC meeting to increase the target for the federal funds 
rate 25 basis points and the accompanying statem ent were in line with expectations and 
evoked little reaction in financial markets.  Favorable inflation data in mid-November led 
investors to mark down their expectations fo r the path of moneta ry policy.  Market 
participants also revised down the policy path in response to the November FOMC 
minutes and speeches by Federal Reserve offici als that investors reportedly read as 
suggesting that only moderate additional pol icy firming would likely be necessary to 
contain inflation pressures.  A steady stream of strong economic data over the past couple 
of weeks, however, more than offset thos e declines in the expected policy path.  
 Judging from federal funds futures quotes, mark et participants have fully priced in a 
25-basis-point tightening at the upcoming FOMC meeting and place high odds on another move at the January meeting.  The policy path over the next year was marked up slightly, 
on net, over the intermeeting period.  With  longer-term expectations about unchanged, 
the policy path now has a slightly more pronounced downtilt between late-2006 and mid-
2007.  Uncertainty about the path of moneta ry policy, implied by options on Eurodollar 
futures, edged up at the si x- and twelve-month horizons. 
 Yields on two-year Treasury securities  were about unchanged, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, but longer-term Treasury yields decreased slightly.  Five-year 
inflation compensation implied by TIPS adjusted  for the indexation lag was little changed

ten years ahead declined somewhat.1  
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
On net, most major stock price indexes rose 5 percent to 7 percent since the last FOMC 
meeting, an increase spurred by reduced in flation concerns and favorable real-side 
economic data.  The equity price gains we re broad based, though technology stocks 
posted the biggest increases.  The equity risk premium—measured by the spread between 
the twelve-month forward trend earnings-pri ce ratio for S&P 500 firms and an estimate 
of the real long-run Treasury yield—narrowed slightly but remained above the average of 
the past two decades.  Implied volatilitie s on both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 indexes 
declined over the in termeeting period. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  moved about in line with those on 
comparable Treasuries since the November FOMC meeting, so credit spreads were 
roughly unchanged.  Indexes of high-yield bond spreads were al so little changed, as GM 
and Ford bonds spreads widened after further troubles were reporte d at GM and these 
increases were largely offset by narrower sp reads for other issuers.  Risk spreads on 
commercial paper—measured by the spread of  yields on thirty-day A2/P2 paper over 
A1/P1 paper—remained low.  No evid ence of year-end pressures has emerged. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality  
With the third-quarter reporti ng period now almost conclude d, four-quarter growth in 
operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms is  estimated to have remained close to  
15 percent.  Third-quarter NIPA  profits were robust as we ll, coming in about 18 percent 
higher than the level of four quarters earli er.  Excluding the hurricane-related hit to 
insurance industry profits, both series also imply strong growth on a quarter-over-quarter 
basis.  Analysts’ revisions to year-ahead  earnings for S&P 500 firms turned slightly 
negative in November.  The decrease from Oc tober, however, was driven almost entirely 
by downward revisions to energy sector foreca sts that reflected the movement of oil 
prices away from their recent peaks.  
                                                
 
1 The larger decline in inflation compensation implie d by the unadjusted five -year TIPS rate reflects a 
substantial indexation lag effect from the large swings in energy prices, which have led investors to expect 
that total CPI will fall back in November from its spike in September.  The high volatility of energy prices, 
however, may have made the adjustment somewhat imprecise.

On balance, the credit quality of nonfinanci al firms has remained strong, supported by 
continued high profitability.  Data through th e third quarter indicate that leverage on 
corporate balance sheets has stayed fairly low and liquidity has stayed high despite a 
rapid pace of equity retirements.  The m odest volume of bond rating downgrades in 
October owed mainly to the announcement of major share repurchase programs by a few highly-rated firms.  The si x-month trailing bond default ra te ticked up in October on 
bankruptcy filings by Delphi and Refco after a sharper rise in September.
2  About one-
half of the jump in the default rate in Se ptember and October reflects troubles in the 
airline and auto industries which are saddled with high legacy cost structures, and these 
factors have not affected broade r credit trends.  The rise may al so reflect filings that were 
pulled ahead to avoid changes in the bankruptcy code that  took effect on October 17.  
The delinquency rate on C&I loans at commer cial banks remained very low in the third 
quarter, and the aggregate expected year-ahead default rate based on KMV was little changed in October at a low level.   
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded strongly in November  after a lull in 
October when interest rates were climbing.  C&I loan growth in October and November 
about matched its rapid third-quarter pace.  By contrast, commercial paper outstandings 
fell sharply in November, reportedly in part because some multinational firms used repatriated foreign profits to pay down their pa per.  On balance, the amount of net debt 
raised by nonfinancial firms through bank loan s, commercial paper, and bonds in October 
and November remained near the solid pace of recent quarters.  Net equity outstanding contracted even more sh arply in the third quart er than earlier this 
year, as equity retirements a pproached a record high.  The pace of retirements reflected a 
surge in cash-financed mergers and acquisitions and continued large share repurchase programs, bolstered by strong profits and still plentiful cash on corporate balance sheets.  
Gross equity issuance picked up with a re bound in IPOs in November, about matching  
                                                
 
2 The bankruptcy of Delphi temporarily created settlement problems in the credit derivatives market 
stemming from the mismatch between the notional amount of these derivatives written on Delphi 
(estimated to be $25 to $30 billi on) and its outstanding debt ($2.5 billion).  Because credit derivatives 
typically require delivery of a defaulted security to th e protection provider in exchange for its par value, 
market participants were concerned that investors would substantially bid up the price of Delphi’s defaulted bonds to obtain them for delivery.  This concern was eased, however, when market participants agreed to 
settle index trades in cash at a price determined by an auction.  Furthermore, most of the single-name credit 
default swap contracts on Delphi were terminated  through a netting process, which facilitated a smooth 
physical settlement for the remaining contracts.

their average monthly pace this year.  None theless, sizable announcements of both share 
repurchases and cash mergers suggest that ne t equity retirements will remain deeply 
negative in the fourth quarter.  
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage borrowing has been stro ng over the past year, with the level of 
debt in the third quarter estim ated to have been about 15 pe rcent above that of a year 
earlier.  Continued robust debt growth in th e sector appears to be in prospect:  The 
issuance calendar for commercial-mortgage-bac ked securities (CMBS) currently shows 
that a record volume of deals are scheduled  to close during the fourth quarter.   
 Spreads of CMBS to comparable Treasuries edged up in November, reportedly owing in part to the plentiful supply, even as credit quality in the sector remains favorable.  
Delinquency rates on CMBS and commercial mo rtgages at commerci al banks and life 
insurance companies remain low by historical standards, and data on office vacancy rates 
and rents point to further improvement in ma rket fundamentals.  Prices of commercial 
properties have risen rapidly this year, k eeping the ratio of net operating income to 
property prices on a steep downtrend.  Nonethele ss, the spread of this  ratio over the real 
perpetuity Treasury yield—a measure of th e risk premium on commercial real estate 
assets—has widened somewhat in recent quarters.  
Household Finance 
Average interest rates on thirty-year fi xed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate home 
mortgages were little changed over the inte rmeeting period after having moved higher in 
late October.  The OFHEO all-transactions house price index increase d at an annual rate 
of 11½ percent in the third quarter after an upwardly revised gain of 14½ percent in the 
second quarter.  Household mortgage debt c ontinued to expand rapidly in the third 
quarter, spurred by the ongoing steep increase in home prices.  Meanwhile, the expansion 
of consumer credit in September and October slowed a bit from its already modest pace.  
Growth of overall household debt exceeded that  of personal income in the third quarter, 
and the financial obligations ratio moved up further.    After reaching unprecedented levels just befo re the implementation of more-stringent 
bankruptcy rules in mid-October, personal ba nkruptcy filings have hovered at very low 
levels in recent weeks, an indication that at  least some of the pre-reform filings were 
pulled forward from future months.  Deli nquency rates on residential mortgages and

consumer loans have remained low in recent months and do not point to deterioration in 
household credit quality.  The continued strength in house prices, coupled  with gains in stock prices, led to an 
increase in household net worth relative to in come in the third quarter.  Net purchases of 
equity mutual funds were strong in Novemb er, as significant infl ows to international 
funds continued and inflows to domestic funds  rebounded amid the rally in U.S. equity 
markets.  Net purchases of bond funds dipped in November. 
 
Treasury and Agency Financing 
The Treasury’s auction of ten-year note s during the intermeeting period was well 
received, but demand in other au ctions was somewhat tepid.  In the three- and five-year 
note auctions, indirect bidder participation—which includes pu rchases by foreign official 
institutions—was a bit below r ecent averages.  In the ten-year auction, however, indirect 
bidders were awarded 56 percent of the amount sold, an unusually high proportion.  The 
Treasury’s mid-quarter refunding announcement noted that they continue to study the 
possibility of establishing a securities lending facility as a possible solution to resolve 
episodes of chronic failures to deliv er in Treasury repo markets.   
 The share price of Freddie Mac ended the pe riod about 4 percent higher, roughly in line 
with the average rise for other financial firms,  but the share price of Fannie Mae was little 
changed, as investors remained concerned abou t its financial reporti ng practices.  Agency 
debt spreads over comparable-maturity Treas uries were largely unchanged, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, tracki ng the behavior of other hi ghly-rated corporate bonds.   
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds was strong in No vember, largely owing to a 
surge in new capital issuance that was fuel ed by education bond i ssues by entities in 
California and New York.  The higher level of interest rates, however, continued to hold 
advance refunding activity well below the robus t pace recorded in the first three quarters 
of the year.  Issuance of s hort-term municipal bonds, boosted by a few large deals, also 
jumped in November.    The credit quality of municipal bonds has rema ined stable.  Rating upgrades have slightly 
outpaced downgrades so far this year despit e the recent downgrades of hurricane-affected 
issuers on the Gulf Coast and the downgrade of Detroit in response to the recent GM

comparable Treasuries narrowed a touch over the intermeeting period. 
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 is now on track to grow at a 5¾ percent annu al rate in the fourth quarter—close to the 
projected growth rate of nominal GDP—aft er apparently receiving a substantial boost 
from hurricane relief payments.  After a robus t October, M2 decelerated in November, as 
growth of both liquid deposits and retail mone y market funds slowed.  The continued rise 
in the opportunity cost of holding M2 balanc es, along with waning mortgage prepayment 
effects and perhaps the increased relative at tractiveness of equities, evidently outweighed 
a further boost to M2 from federal disaster relief payments.  Bank credit decelerated in Oc tober and November from its third-quarter pace, reflecting 
slower growth in both securitie s and total loans.  Continued increases in the prime rate 
apparently began to restrain home equity lendi ng in recent months, and other real estate 
lending also cooled a bit from the double-digit gains posted earlier in the year.  Consumer 
loans decreased slightly in October even af ter adjusting for the acquisition of a large 
credit card bank by a thrift institution.  As noted earlier, however, business lending 
continues to be strong.  The spread of inte rest rates on newly orig inated business loans 
over comparable-maturity Eurodollar and swap rates fell in the most recent Survey of 
Terms of Business Lending (conducted during th e week starting November 7), continuing 
the downward trend over th e past several years. 
 Call Report data for the third quarter indi cated that commercial bank profitability 
remained robust, in part because of a rise in  non-interest income that outweighed the drag 
from higher loss provisioning.  The increase in provisioning re portedly reflected in part 
an expected rise in consumer loan charge-offs  as banks prepared for a surge in personal 
bankruptcies before the new rules went into effect in October.

In September, the value of exports of goods  and services fell 2½ percent from a strong

steep falloff in aircraft exports owing to the strike at Boeing.  Exports of industrial 
supplies and agricultural products declined as well, partly on account of hurricane-related 
disruptions to trade, whereas exports of consumer goods rose. 
 For the third quarter as a whole, nominal e xports of goods and services rose a modest 
2¾ percent at an annual rate, as higher exports in July and August offset September’s 
decline.  Exports of auto motive products and capital goods (with the exception of 
aircraft) were particularly str ong.  In contrast, exports of ai rcraft, industrial supplies, and 
agricultural products declined.  In real terms, exports of goods and services (on a NIPA 
basis) increased only ¾ per cent in the third quarter. 
 The value of imported goods and services rose  about 2½ percent in September, reflecting 
gains in most categories of merchandise imports  and, to a lesser extent, services.  Within 
goods, increases in imports of oil and of indus trial supplies (especially natural gas) were 
particularly strong, reflecting higher prices.  Imports of au tomotive products , on the other 
hand, fell from an elevated August level.

For the third quarter, nominal imports of goods  and services expande d 10¼ percent at an 
annual rate.  Most of this ri se reflected higher pr ices, with the 90 pe rcent increase in 
nominal oil imports being particularly not able.  Imports of non-oil goods rose about 
2¾ percent.  Gains were widespread, with th e exception of consumer goods.  In real 
terms, imports of goods and services (on a NIPA  basis) rose only about 2 percent at an 
annual rate in the third quarter.  
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In October, BLS prices of U.S.  imports of non-oil goods increased 
0.8 percent, and prices of imports of core goods increased 0.9 percen t.  A large increase 
in the price of imported natural gas contribu ted to both increases.  Core goods prices 
excluding natural gas rose 0.3 percent, as high er prices for material -intensive goods were 
partially offset by slightly lower prices fo r finished goods.  Prices of imported non-oil 
industrial supplies, including natural gas, increased 4.4 per cent in October, following an 
identical increase in September.  Natural gas prices led the increase,  with chemicals and 
metals also contributing to the gain.  Im ported food prices increased 1.1 percent in 
October, while the remaining categories of core imports recorded flat or declining prices.  
Imported computer and semiconductor pric es both fell sharply, declining 0.7 and 
0.8 percent respectively.      Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil fell 4.4 percent in October,  reflecting declines 
in the prices of imported crude oil and re fined petroleum products from their hurricane-
induced highs the previous month.  The averag e spot price of West Texas Intermediate 
(WTI) crude oil fell nearly 5 percent in October to about $62.40 per barrel.  The spot 
price continued its decline in November, av eraging $58.30 per barrel.  The decline in the 
spot price over the past few months reflects in part the re lease of strategic stocks in 
response to the hurricanes and, until recentl y, warmer-than-normal temperatures, which 
reduced oil demand and allowed inventories to build.  Recently, the spot price has edged 
up, closing on December 6 at $59.95 per barrel, little changed from the time of the 
November FOMC meeting.  Exports.  In October, the prices of U.S. exports  of total goods increased 0.6 percent, and 
the price of core exports increa sed 0.7 percent.  The increase in export prices was led by a 
1.7 percent increase in prices of  exported non-agricultural in dustrial supplies, with the 
largest contribution coming from chemicals.  However, all other major categories of core 
exports also posted increases.   Prices of both exported ca pital goods and consumer goods 
increased 0.3 percent, while prices of auto motive products and agricu ltural products both

 U.S. International Financial Transactions 
In October, foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. 
International Transactions table) totaled $31 billion, compared with outflows of $5 billion 
in September.  September’s outflows were  unusual and reflected both a significant 
slowing of inflows from China and net official  sales of U.S. assets by the G-10 countries 
and the ECB (line 1a).  In October, howeve r, flows from the G-10 countries and the ECB 
turned positive, and those from OPEC (lin e 1b) moved up significan tly.  
 
.  For the third quarter, total foreign official infl ows were $37 billion, 
below the unusually large inflows recorded for the second quarter.  However, the pace of inflows from July to October was similar to  that during the firs t half of the year. 
 It should be noted that these m onthly transactions data may at tribute some foreign official 
flows to the foreign private sect or if the official investment s are made via foreign private 
intermediaries.  Thus, the official inflows reported above are likely to be understated, and 
the foreign private inflows reported below in  line 4 are likely to be overstated.   
 As recorded, net foreign private purchases of U. S. securities (line 4) slowed in October to 
$78 billion as foreign purchases of corporate-de bt securities (line 4c) dropped from their 
rapid pace in September.  Foreign purchases of other debt securities picked up, whereas 
purchases of equities cooled.  For the first te n months of the year, to tal net foreign private 
acquisitions of U.S. securities amounted to  $574 billion, surpassing the value recorded 
for 2004 as a whole.    U.S. residents purchased $5 billion of foreign se curities (line 5) in October, a significant 
slowing from the pace in September.  Net sale s of foreign bonds (line 5a) partly offset net 
purchases of foreign equities (line 5b).  U. S. residents continued to show a marked 
preference for Japanese equities in October, increasing their holdings of those securities 
by $4 billion.  For the third quarter, total pu rchases of foreign securities amounted to $34 
billion, somewhat lower than in the second quarter.  The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a substantia l inflow in October of $34 
billion, exceeding the inflows recorded for September.  Fo r the third quarter, total net 
inflows were $20 billion, compared to net outflows of $45 billion for the second quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The major currencies index of the dollar rose 1¼ percent on net over the intermeeting 
period, as the dollar appreciated against most major currencies.  On a bilateral basis, the 
dollar appreciated 2¼ percent versus the euro, 1¾ percent against sterling, and 3½ 
percent vis-à-vis the yen.  In contrast, th e dollar depreciated 1½ percent vis-à-vis the 
Canadian dollar.                      The dollar appreciated against the euro over the intermeeting period despite a tightening 
move by the European Central Bank which had not been widely expected as of early 
November.  European Central Bank President Trichet strongly signa led in mid-November 
that an increase in the ECB’s minimum refi nancing rate would come sooner than had 
been expected and, on December 1, the ECB raised its minimum refinancing rate 25 basis points, to 2.25 percent, its first move sin ce June 2003.  Social unrest in France appeared 
to weigh on the euro early in the period; some  market analysts also speculated that the 
euro’s weakness versus the dollar may be due in part to the repatr iation of funds from 
Europe to the United States spurred by the Homeland Investment Act.  The dollar 
appreciated versus the yen to its highest leve l since early 2003, as investors scaled back 
expectations that the Bank of Japan would end its policy of quantitati ve easing in the next

few months.  Japanese government official s publicly pressured the Bank of Japan to 
delay a change in its monetary  policy stance, going as far as threatening to change the 
law governing the Bank of Japan’s independen ce.  The Canadian dollar was supported by 
growing expectations over th e period that the Bank of Canada may extend its current 
tightening cycle for a longer period than had pr eviously been expected.  This was spurred 
by strong Canadian output, export, and inflati on data.  The Bank of Canada increased its 
main policy interest rate 25 basis points, to 3.25 percent, on December 6, and signaled 
that further tightening moves were likely.                     Three-month interest rates rose about 25 basis points on balan ce over the period in 
Canada and about 20 basis points in the euro area and the Unit ed States; they were little 
changed in the United Kingdom and Japan.  Te n-year sovereign yields were little 
changed on balance in the euro area and Japan;  they declined about 5 basis points in the 
United Kingdom and about 10 basis points in  Canada and the United States.  The 
inflation compensation implied by the differe nce between long-term nominal yields and 
yields on inflation-indexed notes declined abou t 5 basis points in the euro area, Japan and 
the United Kingdom.  Equity indexes rose substantially throughout the industrial world 
over the period, with net increase s of 6 percent or more in th e euro area and Canada.  In Financial Indicators in Major Industrial Countries

Equity prices also rose subs tantially in a number of emerging market economies over the 
period.  Headline indexes registered increases  of about 10 percent in Mexico, Brazil, 
Taiwan, and Korea.  There were only sma ll movements in the exchange rates of the 
currencies of emerging Asian countries versus  the dollar, implying an appreciation of 
these currencies against the Japanese yen.  In contrast, the Mexican peso and the 
Brazilian real appreciated about 3-1/2 percent vers us the dollar.  The Mexican peso 
appeared to have been boosted by grow ing optimism about the country’s economic 
IV-11 
performance.  The Argentine peso was little changed against the dollar, and the Merval 
stock index declined 3 percent.  Argentine Finance Minister Lava gna, widely credited 
with the recent recovery in  Argentina’s economy, resigned his post in late November, 
reportedly following a dispute wi th Argentina’s president ov er the conduct of economic 
policy.  
 The dollar price of gold rose 11 percent over the period, exceed ing $500 per ounce for 
the first time since 1983.  Alt hough the factors driving this price increase were unclear, 
market analysts generally did not interpret this move as a harb inger of future inflationary 
pressure.    
  The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Growth in the foreign industrial countries wa s surprisingly strong in  the third quarter, and 
indicators for the fourth quart er are promising, on balance.  The growth rate in the euro 
area picked up as investment and exports st rengthened, and some surveys of business 
activity improved further in th e fourth quarter.  Although grow th moderated in Japan and 
the United Kingdom, investment expanded br iskly, and consumption growth in both 
countries stayed firm.  Canadian GDP acceler ated in the third quarter, boosted by net 
exports and still solid grow th in domestic demand.  Employment growth in Canada 
remained robust in the first tw o months of this quarter. 
 Headline rates of consumer price inflation fe ll back a touch in Oct ober in most of the 
major foreign economies in line with the dec lines in energy prices.  Central banks in 
Canada and the euro area tightened monetary policy. 
 Real GDP in Japan  rose 1.7 percent (s.a.a.r.) during th e third quarter, marking the fourth 
consecutive quarter of positive growth.  Alt hough domestic demand decelerated from its 
pace in the first half of the year, it continued to be the country’s primary source of 
growth.  Both private consumption and gro ss fixed private investment expanded at a 
moderate pace.  Inventories also rose for the quarter, leading to a further rise in 
inventory/sales ratios.  Imports posted a surp risingly strong increase, which resulted in a 
slight decline in net exports.   October data have been generally positive.  Industrial production rose 0.6 percent on the 
month, lower than had been expected, but sh ipments rose 1.7 percent.  Real worker 
household spending rose 1.2 percent, reboundin g from a decline in the third quarter.   Real 
exports rose slightly while real imports fell,  leaving the real trade surplus up 9.5 percent 
from the previous month.  The unemployment rate jumped back up to 4.5 percent after falling to 4.2 percent in September; however , the decline in employment was almost 
entirely amongst those reporting themselves as self-employed or as family workers, while 
regular employment was fairly stable. Despite the rise in th e unemployment rate, the job 
offers-to-applicants ratio rose to a ne w twelve-year high.  Nominal wages rose 
0.5 percent over the twelve months endi ng in October, and summer bonuses rose 
1.3 percent from the previous year followi ng an already strong round of bonuses at the 
start of the year.

Consumer prices declined 0.7 percent in th e twelve months ending in October, though 
core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy, were unchanged over 
the same period and the their twelve-month rate is expected to turn positive by the end of 
the year. Tokyo core consumer prices, which are reported one month in advance of the figures for the country as a whole, fell 0.3 per cent in the year to N ovember. In the third 
quarter, the GDP deflator fell 1.1 percent below its level a year earlier.  Monetary policy 
was unchanged.  Long-term interest rates fell following statements by the Prime Minister 
and other government official s that strongly questioned th e Bank of Japan’s apparent 
intention to end its policy of quantitative easi ng in the first half of 2006.  However, we do 
not see any sign that Bank offi cials have given ground on this issue, although they have 
emphasized that they may hold the policy rate at zero for some time after ending 
quantitative easing.

In the euro area , GDP growth rebounded to a 2.6 percen t annual rate in th e third quarter, 
supported by strength in investment and e xports.  GDP grew at about the euro-area

Recent survey data generally indicate that bu siness activity in the euro area entered the 
fourth quarter on an upswing.  The manufact uring PMI rose from 51.7 in September to 
52.7 in October, the highest level in a year, and edged slightly highe r in November.  The 
services PMI made smaller gains edging up to 55.2 in November from 54.6 in September.  
The European Commission survey of busine ss sentiment also improved (for the fifth 
month in a row) in October and held that gain in November.  Hard data on business 
activity have been mixed, with euro-area i ndustrial production dec lining 0.4 percent (not 
annualized) in September but rising a solid 0.8 percent for the third quarter as a whole.

Consumer spending continued to be a relativ e weak component of demand in the euro 
area in the third quarter, especially in Ge rmany, where private consumption declined 
again.  However, a recent upturn in euro-ar ea consumer sentiment may be a sign that 
improved prospects for employment and inco me could lead to a rebound in consumer 
spending.  The European Commission’s measure of consumer sentiment picked up in September and October from weak readings over the summer (and held those gains in 
November), with the improvement coming mainly in consumers’ perceptions of 
employment prospects.  In contrast, French consumer confidence declined in November.  
The euro-area unemployment rate  ticked down to 8.3 percent in September and remained 
there in October.  The rate is down from the cy clical peak of 8.9 percen t late last year, but 
is still above the 7.8 perc ent low reached in mid-2001.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation edge d down to 2.4 percent in November from a 
high of 2.6 percent in September.  Core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed 
food, picked up to 1.6 percent in Oct ober but remained near recent lows. 
 On December 1, the ECB’s Governing Council ra ised its official in terest rates 25 basis 
points, moving its key policy rate up to 2.25 pe rcent after keeping it unchanged for nearly 
2½ years.  The rate hike had been widely e xpected after President Trichet had indicated 
in a speech on November 18 that the Governin g Council was ready to move rates higher.  
At the press conference following the Decembe r 1 meeting, Trichet said that “we [the 
Governing Council] are not engagi ng ex ante in a series of interest rate increases and … 
we will continue to monitor closely all deve lopments with respect  to risks to price 
stability.”  Also following the December  meeting, the ECB unveiled its new staff 
forecasts, which showed a somewhat higher path than the previous forecast for GDP growth and inflation this year and next.  The mid-point of the ECB’s forecast for inflation 
is just above 2 percent in  2006 and just below in 2007.

House prices have been rising in recent  months, after staying roughly unchanged for

prices rose 2.3 and 5.9 percent on a twelve -month basis, respectively.  Lending secured 
on dwellings rose 0.8 percent in October, a tad higher than in September.  Mortgage 
refinancing fell, suggesting that much of th e October lending was associated with new

 Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brow n presented the government’s Pre-Budget 
Report on December 5.   Brown raised his projection for Public Sector Net Borrowing to 
about 3 percent of GDP for fiscal year 2005-06 and to about 2.7 percen t of GDP for fiscal 
year 2006-07.  In the third quarter, real GDP in Canada  expanded 3.6 percent in the third quarter, with 
strong domestic demand helped by a rebound in e xports.  After a small decline in exports 
in the second quarter, third- quarter export growth topped 10 percent, led by exports of 
automobiles, energy products, and agricultura l products.  Output of the mining, oil, and 
gas extraction sector was up strongly as well,  and overall industri al production posted a 
solid advance.  Business investment growth  continued its recent steady climb, reaching 
its fastest pace in nearly two years, but out put in the residentia l construction sector 
declined.  Consumer spending, which propped up  growth over the past year, continued to 
decelerate, led by a second straight quarte r of declining spending in the household 
furnishings sector.

On balance, early indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that act ivity continues to be 
firm.  The composite index of leading indicato rs advanced in October, with indicators of 
retail trade activity among the sour ces of strength.  Housing starts declined in October, 
IV-19 
but still remain elevated.  The Ivey Purc hasing Managers Index picked up a bit in 
November.  The solid job gains of the pa st year have continued in the fourth quarter.  Total 
employment increased in both October and November, with the November jump driven entirely by an increase in full-time jobs, which have been where job gains have been 
concentrated throughout the year.  The une mployment rate dipped in November to 
6.4 percent, its lowest level in over 30 years.   Even the beleaguere d manufacturing sector, 
which has shed about 5 percent of its workfor ce over the past year, saw solid job gains in 
November.  In October, the twelve-month rate of consumer price infl ation fell to 2.6 percent from 
3.4 percent in September,  almost entirely a result of a sharp fall in gasoline prices.  The 
twelve-month rate of core inflation, excludi ng the eight most volatile components, held 
steady at 1.7 percent for the third consecutive month.

In December, the Bank of Canada increased the targeted overnight rate 25 basis points to 
3.25 percent, following 25-basis-point increases at each of its previous two meetings.  
This move was widely expected.  In its accompanying statement, the Bank said the 
economy has been evolving broadly in line with  its expectations and that “some further 
IV-20 
reduction in monetary stimulus will be require d…over the next four to six quarters” to 
keep inflation on target.  On November 29, after the minority Liberal gove rnment lost a vote of confidence, Prime 
Minister Martin announced that national el ections will be held on January 23.  The 
current minority government has been in place since June 2004.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent indicators of economic activity acr oss the developing economies have been 
generally positive.  In Asia, economic perf ormance has been robust, most notably in 
greater China, Korea, and India.  In Latin America, performance in Mexico and Argentina was solid in the third quarter; how ever, Brazilian activity has been weak.  
Inflation in the developing world has e dged up but generally remains contained. 
 Chinese  industrial production continued to grow  at a solid pace in October, as did 
investment, which was up more than 25 percent from a year earlier.  Chinese government 
officials, including Premier Wen, have made se veral statements about the need to slow 
investment growth further.  However, to date  no new steps have been taken.  At the same 
time, retail sales growth has remained in double-digit territory.  The trade surplus has 
hovered around $100 billion (annualized) in rece nt months, triple the 2004 level, and 
both exports and imports surged in Octobe r to new record highs.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation remains low.

Recent data from Hong Kong  have been generally positive.   In the third quarter, real 
GDP expanded almost 10 percent (s.a.a.r.), on the back of strong pe rformance in exports 
and private consumption.  Reports indicate that Hong Kong Disneyland opened to large 
crowds, which may have boosted growth in  the third quarter.  In October, the 
unemployment rate fell to its lowest rate in four years.  Trade vol ume, a good indicator of 
activity in Hong Kong’s entrepôt economy, moved up in September.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation has continued to e dge up in recent months but remains below 
2 percent.

In Taiwan , recently revised GDP figures indicate grow th in the first half of the year was 
about two times higher than previously repo rted.  In the third quarter, output expanded 
almost 7 percent (s.a.a.r.), the highest rate in nearly two years, reflecting strong export 
growth and inventory accumulation.  Indus trial production in th e third quarter was 
3.2 percent higher than in the second quarter and continued to expand in October, while 
new orders for electronics and other goods were also up.  The unemployment rate has 
inched down in recent months.  Exports surged  to a new high in October, contributing to 
a sizeable monthly trade surplus, before moderating a bit in November.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation fell back for th e third straight month in November to 
2½ percent.

Economic indicators for Korea  remain upbeat.  Third-quarter  real GDP was revised up 
half a percentage point, to 8 percent.  Mo re recently, indus trial production rose 1 percent 
in October after surging the pr evious month.  A post -strike recovery in the auto sector 
was behind much of the October gain but in creases in other export-linked sectors also 
boosted production.  Consumer and business conf idence jumped in October, and the level 
of retail sales remained elevated.  Exports fe ll slightly in October after previous rapid 
increases, but a larger decline in imports led to an improvement in the trade balance.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation wa s 2.4 percent in November, unchanged from 
the third-quarter pace.

Data from the ASEAN  countries indicate that economic activity continued to expand at a 
solid pace, but performance varied across the region.  Third-quarter real GDP rose 
9 percent in Thailand, 7 per cent in Singapore, and around 6 percent in Malaysia and 
Indonesia.  In the Philippines, however, growth moderated from the strong second-
quarter pace, mostly due to a contraction of  government expenditures aimed at reining in 
the high public debt level.  More recently, October industrial activity was up a bit in 
Singapore, but down in Thailand and Malaysia .  Data and anecdotes from the region 
point to a recovery in global demand for high- tech products and to an expansion of the 
external sector going forward.  Consumer price inflation rema ins elevated in much of th e region, reflecting higher food 
prices in some countries as well as the effect  of higher energy pri ces.  The increases in 
energy costs were partly a result of cuts in  fuel subsidies, most notably in Indonesia, 
where twelve-month inflation exceeded 17 per cent in October and November after fuel 
subsidies were sharply reduced.  Citing concer ns over higher inflation, the central bank of 
Indonesia raised interest rate s 125 basis points in November and another 50 basis points 
in December. Similarly, Malaysia raised in terest rates 30 basis points in November.

The Indian  economy remains strong.  Output rose 7.6 percent in the third quarter with 
large gains in the trade and service s ectors and continued healthy growth in 
manufacturing.  More recent data point to a s light improvement in India’s trade deficit in 
October, reflecting an uptick in export grow th.  The closely watched wholesale price 
index rose 4.6 percent in October, in part re flecting the effect of ear lier reductions in fuel 
subsidies.

In Mexico , recent data releases po int to a strong but uneven recovery from the weak 
second quarter.  Real GDP jumped almost 9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, 
supported by a sharp recovery in agriculture from its contraction in the second quarter.  
Services sector output also grew solidly.  Despite high real intere st rates, domestic 
IV-30 
demand has continued to perform well.  However, industrial activity (especially 
manufacturing) remained weak, mainly due to anemic auto exports to the United States.   
 Consumer price inflation has stayed well contained.  Twelve-month consumer price 
inflation was 3 percent in October, at the middle of the 2-to-4 pe rcent target range.  
Furthermore, twelve-month core inflation st ood at 3.1 percent in October.  The soft 
economy and improved inflation prospects le d the Bank of Mexico (BOM) to begin 
easing policy in late August; the BOM has eas ed policy four times in as many months 
since then.  As a result, the rate on 28-day peso-denominated bills, a widely used measure of the monetary policy stance, has fallen fr om 9.6 percent in early August to 8.4 percent 
in early December.

In Brazil , real GDP declined 4.7 percent (s.a.a.r.)  in the third quarter, led by a 13 percent 
fall in agricultural output.  I ndustrial output also contracte d.  Indicators for the fourth 
quarter point to continued w eakness, as October auto sa les and production were down, 
unemployment edged up, and industrial output  stagnated.  Headline inflation rose to 
6.4 percent in October on a twelve-month basis,  reflecting in part a September hike in 
prices of gasoline and diesel fuel.  Food and energy price increases a ppear to have kept 
IV-31 
inflation elevated through mid- November as well.  The trad e surplus rose in November, 
on the back of strong export growth.    In late November, the centra l bank reduced its policy rate 50 basis points to 18.5 percent, 
following rate reductions of 25 and 50 ba sis points at the September and October 
meetings.  The weakening economy and the politi cal scandals have ex acerbated political 
pressures to loosen macroeconomic policies,  and Finance Minister Palocci has been 
rumored in recent weeks to be on the verge of resigning.

In Argentina , the monthly index of economic activ ity, which has closely tracked real 
GDP growth in recent years, suggests that out put in the third quarte r likely continued to 
expand at close to the second quarter’s robus t 10 percent pace.  In  addition, industrial 
production in the third quarter was 2 percent above its second-quart er level.  Twelve-
month consumer price inflation was 12 per cent in November, well above the central 
bank’s informal target range of 5 to 8 per cent for the end of 2005.  The central bank has 
continued to intervene to st em upward pressures on the pes o, although recently in smaller 
amounts.  In late November, the government announ ced the appointment of Felisa Miceli as 
Finance Minister, after the re signation of Roberto Lavagna.  Rumors of a rift between 
President Kirchner and Mr. Lavagna had long existed, and a cabinet reshuffle was 
expected after recent legislativ e elections.  Mrs. Miceli, curr ently president of the state-
IV-32 
owned Banco de la Nacion, will have to st eer Argentina through difficult negotiations 
with the IMF.  Market s reacted unfavorably to the appoint ment of Mrs. Miceli, a little-
known economist who has close political conne ctions to the administration, because of 
concerns that she will be less independent than Mr. Lavagna.

In Venezuela , real GDP is estimated to have fall en 10.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third 
quarter.  The contraction followed a very st rong first half of th e year and reflected 
declines in both petroleum and non-petroleu m output.  The policy environment continues 
to be weak, as monetary and fiscal policies re main lax.  Despite a fixed exchange rate and 
price controls on many products, inflati on has been persistently high and was 
15.3 percent in November on a twelve-month ba sis.  President Chavez’s ruling party won 
a landslide victory in the December 4 parlia mentary elections, but opposition parties had 
boycotted the vote over concerns about electoral procedures.
