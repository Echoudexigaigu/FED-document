Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1  
Although top-line GDP growth seem s to have slowed in the fourth quarter, incoming data 
indicate that the underlying pace of demand growth has remained solid.  Household 
spending for items other than motor vehicles rose smartly last qua rter, and while light 
vehicle sales slumped in October and November, a payback for the earlier surge was expected.  Housing markets appear to have  cooled somewhat, although starts and sales 
both remain at relatively high levels.  In the business sector, orde rs and shipments of 
nondefense capital goods were generally strong in  the fourth quarter, and orders backlogs 
were up.  Even excluding the effects of a post-hurricane rebound in energy-producing and 
other affected industries, industrial production posted modera te gains during the fourth 
quarter.  Moreover, private payrolls expanded at a solid rate , on average, in November 
and December.  Headline consumer price infl ation was held down in the fourth quarter by 
falling consumer energy prices, but crude oi l prices have again risen back up above $65 
per barrel in recent weeks.  Meanwhile, core inflation has moved up a bit from this summer’s low level. 
 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor demand expanded further in the fourth quarter.  Although priv ate nonfarm payroll 
employment increased only 94,000 in December, this increase followed an upward-revised gain of 281,000 in November.  The av erage job gain over those two months was 
likely boosted by a catch-up in employment  following the hurricanes; still, even 
abstracting from this influence, the recent pace of job gains appears to have been solid.  The erratic monthly pattern of  payroll gains may reflect, in  part, seasonal adjustment 
difficulties, as employment was reported to have declined in  December in industries with 
large and somewhat unpredictabl e seasonal variation, such as retail trade, construction, 
and courier and messenger services, each of which was estimated to have added jobs in November.  Elsewhere, December saw robust job gains in manufacturing, professional 
and technical services, h ealth-care services, and f ood and drink services.   
 
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervis ory workers on private nonfarm payrolls 
fell 0.2 percent in December, as a 0.1 hour dr op in the workweek outweighed the increase 
in employment.  But this decrease followed a larger increase in November, and aggregate 
hours in the fourth quarter as a whole increased at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from their 
third-quarter level.

II-5 
 The four-week moving average of initial cl aims for unemployment insurance stood at 
299,000 for the week ending January 14, a level th at points to another solid gain in 
payrolls this month.  On net, the most recent readings of so me other indicators of labor 
demand are similar to pre-Katrina levels:  The Conference Board and Michigan Survey 
measures of individuals' exp ectations of future labor mark et conditions were a bit below 
pre-hurricane levels, but job ope nings moved up in November to levels well above those 
seen earlier this year.  Meanwhile, layoff a nnouncements and the hiring-plan measures of 
the National Federation of Independent Busi ness (NFIB) and Manpow er Inc. all stand 
near the middle of their range over the past year. 
 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te edged down to 4.9 percent in December, 
the low end of the narrow range it has traver sed since March.  The participation rate 
ticked down as well, to 66.0 percent.  On bala nce, these and other la bor market indicators 
suggest little net change in labor market sl ack over the second half of last year.  The 
number of individuals in nonagricultural industries working part-time for economic 
reasons moved down some at the end of last year as a percentage of employment.  The 
percentage of individuals who have used up their full benefit entitlement before leaving 
insured unemployment (the exhaustion rate) fe ll sharply in December from a high level in 
November, but this series has not clearl y trended lower in recent months.  The 
Conference Board’s index of whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, and the NFIB’s 
measure of hard-to-fill vacancies, both  have changed little in recent months. 
 
Industrial Production 
The recovery from the effects of Hurrican es Katrina and Rita boosted output in the 
industrial sector late last y ear.  Industrial production (IP) rose 0.8 percent in November 
and 0.6 percent in December; more than half of  the gains in those months originated in 
industries where production had b een curtailed by the hurricanes.  In particular, output in 
the mining industry, which includes oil and gas extraction, increas ed sharply in both 
November and December.  The manufacturing se ctor was also supported late in the year 
by a hurricane-related recovery in produc tion, though overall factory output was held 
down by a drop in motor vehicle assemblies.  In addition, utilities output popped up in 
December as temperatures turned unseasonabl y cold in the first half of the month.  
Abstracting from the effects of these special  factors, we estimate that underlying activity 
in the industrial sector advanced moderately near year-end.  The capacity utilization rate

The oil and gas platforms in the Gulf regi on that were idled or  damaged by Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita have conti nued to return to production.  As of January 25, domestic 
crude production stood at about 92 percent of  its pre-Katrina level, and natural gas 
extraction was at roughly 95 percent.1  For both oil and gas, co mplete recoveries are not 
anticipated until the second half of the year.  In contrast, nearly all the idled oil refineries 
have returned to full production; only one refinery, representing about 0.7 percent of 
domestic capacity, remains out of service (and that refinery is expected to return to 
production in the first quarter), and just four refineries are operating at reduced rates.  
The available information on production and s hut-in capacity suggest s that both oil and 
gas extraction will contribute modestly to IP growth in January.  Outside of the 
energy-producing industries, th e restarting of facilities id led by the hurricanes lifted 
output again in December, though to a lesser de gree than in the previous two months; in 
particular, basic chemicals production in the region added nearly 0.1 percentage point to 
IP after boosting output ¼ per centage point in November.2    
 
Total motor vehicle production fell to an annual rate of 11.2 million units in December.  
For the fourth quarter as a whole, assemb lies averaged an 11.8 million unit pace, down 
about 400,000 units from the elevated rate in the previous quarter.  With the supply of 
light vehicles at 69 days in December, inventories appear slightly elevated relative to sales.  Accordingly, the automa kers’ latest assembly plans call for production to remain a 
bit soft in the first quarter.

1 About one-third of U.S. crude oil extraction, about one-fifth of natural gas extraction, and just under 
one-half of refining capacity are locat ed in the Gulf of Mexico region.  After Hurricane Rita, in the Gulf 
Coast, essentially all crude oil extraction and about 80 percent of natural gas extraction were shut in. 
2 At the beginning of October, nearly half of  domestic petrochemicals capacity was idled by the 
hurricanes. 
3 Delphi, a major parts supplier to General Motors (GM), filed for bankruptcy protection in October 
and since then has been in ongoing negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW) over wages and 
benefits.  Delphi was originally scheduled to file a motion with the bankruptcy court on December 16 to 
cancel its collective-bargaining agreem ents and to impose a drastically lower hourly labor rate and reduced 
benefits for workers.  However, Delphi postponed f iling the motion after GM intervened and agreed to 
provide interim financial support by forgoing 2006 price cuts for Delphi parts.  Delphi now says the UAW has until February 16 to accept concessions or risk having their labo r contracts terminated.

Elsewhere in transportation, the output of both commercial and military aircraft rose 
further in December.  New orders at Boei ng ended the year on a strong note, and with 
backlogs at year-end about 65 percent higher than a year earlier, production rates are 
scheduled to increase in the first quarter of 2006.  The output of military aircraft will 
likely edge down in the near-term after havi ng increased at a rapid pace from the middle 
of 2000 to the present. 
 
High-tech output rose 2.7 percent in December, about the same rate as earlier in the year. 
The production of computers and peripherals increased in December at about the same 
modest pace seen throughout most of 2005.  The output of communications equipment rose solidly for a ninth consecu tive month, and other indicators for this industry, such as 
the CIO Magazine  diffusion index, show no signs of weakening.  The output of 
semiconductors grew briskly in December  as the production of chips used in 
communications equipment and consumer electron ics continued to rise  at a rapid clip.  
However, the output of microprocessor units (M PUs) has been weak in recent months, in 
part due to a shortage of the semiconducto r chipsets used in conjunction with MPUs 
inside lower-end personal computers.  This s hortage is likely to pe rsist for a few months 
and may restrain near-term demand for MPUs.
4  Indeed, Intel’s revenue expectation for 
the first quarter is consistent  with only a moderate incr ease in MPU production.  Another 
forward-looking indicator—orders and sh ipments of semiconductor manufacturing 
equipment—softened a touch in December after having increased notably in the preceding several months.  
 
Outside of the energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products sectors, 
production increased last month in most mark et groups.  The production of consumer and 
business equipment rose moderately in Decem ber, with the gains in business equipment 
concentrated in oil and gas field machiner y and in farm equipment.  The index for 
construction supplies fell  in December; however, during the preceding three months, 
output had surged nearly 1.5 percent pe r month, possibly boosted by stockbuilding 
associated with rebuilding efforts in the Gu lf region.  The index for materials rose in 
December; continued recovery in chemicals accounted for most of the production gains. 
 
                                                 
4 The shortage of chipsets seems to have arisen b ecause Intel underestimated demand for low-end PCs.  
Unlike MPUs, most of Intel’s chipsets are manufactured abroad.

II-13 
 On balance, indicators of near-term manuf acturing activity point to moderate production 
gains in the coming months.  In particular , the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) 
diffusion index of new orders edged up in Dece mber and remains in the region associated 
with solid production increases.  And the earl y readings on new orders in January from 
the regional Federal Reserve surveys were a bit firmer than their December values.  
However, the three-month moving average of the Board staff’s series on real adjusted 
durable goods orders decreased  0.8 percent in November and suggests a softer outlook 
than that portrayed by the survey measures.    The diffusion index of capital spending plans in the ISM Semiannual Econom
 ic Forecast, 
released in early December, rose to its highest  level in more than fifteen years.  This 
reading suggests that manufacturers will increase capital spending more than 10 percent in 2006, a bit faster than the Board staff’ s estimate for manufacturing investment for 
2005.  As a result, manufacturing capacity will likely increase around 2½ percent in 
2006, a touch more than the increase in 2005, though still below the average pace of 
about 3 percent from 1972 to 2004. 
 
Motor Vehicles  
The pull-ahead/payback cycle a ssociated with las
 t summer’s employee pricing programs 
appears to have run its course.  In Decembe r, sales moved up to an annual rate of 
17.1 million units, close to the average for the ye ar as a whole.  
 
 The forward-looking indicators of  vehicle dem
 and point to a moderate pace of sales in 
the near term.  The recent gains in income  and employment bode well for vehicle sales, 
and consumers’ car-buying attitudes have r ecovered recently.  The Michigan SRC index 
of car-buying attitudes increased for a third mo nth in January and was at its highest level 
since August.  Although gasoline pr ices still appear to be of  concern to consumers, the 
fraction of Michigan Survey respondents who cited high gaso line prices as the reason for 
their pessimistic views of buying conditions ha s dropped sharply from the recent peak in 
October.  Incentives do not appear to be infl uencing sales much of late.  After having

The Big Three automakers’ combined share of  sales continued to decline in 2005 as an 
increase in Chrysler’s share was more than  offset by declines at General Motors and 
Ford.  In light of these trends, both GM and Ford have announced plans for significant 
reductions in capacity over the next several years.6  Nevertheless, the overall share of 
vehicles sold that were produced in North America was little changed for a second year 
because of a rise in the domestic production of foreign brands.  
 
Consumer Spending 
Overall real personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) growth was held down on net in 
the fourth quarter by the aforementioned pa yback for the summertime surge in motor 
vehicle sales.  Excluding motor vehicles, real  PCE is estimated to have increased at a 
solid pace in both October and November.  The general underlying strength in PCE appears to be consistent with the mos tly positive movements in the fundamental 
determinants of consumer spending. 
 
In the retail control category of goods, which excludes sa les by auto dealers and building 
material and supply stores, nominal spending rose 0.3 percent in December, a little stronger than the average posted for October and November.  Factoring in our projection 
of PCE prices, we estimate that real sp ending on consumer goods excluding motor 
vehicles rose 0.6 percent last month after sizab le increases in the previous two months.  
Real outlays for consumer services rose 0.2 percent in November, the latest month of 
available data, and we expect that a weathe r-induced increase in energy services gave a 
temporary boost to services consumption in December.  The personal saving rate stood at -0.2 percent in October and Nove mber, in line with its pre-hurricane level.  (In August,  
                                                 
5 GM recently announced plans to reduce both sticker pr ices and incentives for most of its models.  We 
expect these changes to have little effect on bottom-line prices. 
6 GM idled three plants in 2005 and plans to idle four more plants by the end of 2008.  We estimate 
that these plants account for about 1.3 million units per year of domestic light vehicle capacity.  Similarly, 
Ford has announced plans to close three U.S. assembly plants by the end of 2007,  reducing capacity by an 
estimated 650,000 units per year; Ford expects to anno unce two additional plant closures this year, though 
these plants may be in Mexico or Canada.  However, ca pacity at transplants is likely to be increased over 
this period.  Total light vehicle capacity at the end of 2005 was about 14.7 million units per year.

 the saving rate was reported to have droppe d temporarily to -3.4 percent, a decrease 
reflecting a hit to income from uninsured hurricane-related losses.) 
 
Many of the fundamental determinants of cons umer spending have strengthened in recent 
months.  After having fallen in the third quart er, real disposable pe rsonal income firmed 
in October and increased 0.7 percent in N ovember, a strengthening bolstered by solid 
gains in the labor market and the drop in en ergy prices.  Ongoing ga ins in home prices 
and equity prices have continued to push up the ratio of household wealth to disposable 
income relative to earlier in 2005.  Cons umer confidence, as measured by both the 
Michigan Survey and the Conference Board, moved up in November and December, 
reversing the declines that followed the hu rricanes of late summer.  The preliminary 
reading of the Michigan Survey for January edged up further, and the current level of 
consumer sentiment is consistent with so lid consumer spending in the near term. 
 
Housing Markets  
The tenor of recent anecdotal reports and near -term indicators point to some cooling in 
the housing market.  The Mortgage Bankers Asso ciation’s index of mortgage applications 
for home purchases declined in November a nd has remained at this lower level since 
then.  The Michigan Survey index of ho mebuying attitudes has also remained low 
following a significant drop in September 2005.  Fu rthermore, the stock of homes for sale 
has increased in recent months, and months ’ supply of new and existing homes are now 
both in the upper end of the range s they have occupied since 1997. 
 
Similarly, the pace of home sales has come off its peak from earlier in the year, although 
it remains at a relatively high level.  Sales of existing single-family homes fell to an annual rate of 5.7 million units in December, a level not seen since early 2004.  However, the average pace of sales for the fourth quart er as a whole was as high as it was last 
winter.  New home sales in November fell fr om October’s record-setting pace but again 
were not below the pace of sales earlier in the year. 
 
Residential construction activ ity also has shown signs, albeit limited, of cooling.  
Single-family housing starts decreased marked ly in December to an annual rate of 
1.58 million units.  However, this decline came off an especially high level in November, 
and we suspect that unusually cold and wet weather limited reside ntial building activity

in parts of the country last month.  In the mu ltifamily sector, starts increased in December 
to a level in the middle of the fairly tight range  we have seen during the past seven years.  
New permit issuance and the backlog of unused  permits for both single- and multifamily 
homes suggest that the level of residen tial construction in the coming months will 
maintain the pace averaged in the second half of last year. 
 
House prices have not yet shown convinci ng signs of deceleration, although the most 
informative types of data are somewhat out of date.  The purchase-only version of the 
OFHEO price index, which controls for differences in quality by tracking repeat sales of 
the same houses over time, was 11 percent higher  in the third quarter than it was a year 
earlier.  The constant-quality price index fo r new homes—which controls for changes in 
the geographic composition of sa les, home size, and other re adily measurable attributes—
also showed large gains through the third quarter of 2005.  More-recent indicators are limited to price measures that do not control for the mix of homes sold and that can be 
quite erratic.  The average pric e of existing homes sold in December was 7 percent higher 
than it was a year earlier, slightly less than the increase that occurred during the previous twelve-month period.  The average price of new homes sold has decelerated in recent 
months to the low end of the wide range  experienced during the past seven years.

Mortgage rates have edged lower in the past  month after displaying significant increases 
in the second half of last year.  On net, th e rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage has 
risen about 60 basis points since June, and the rate on the one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgage has increased n early 100 basis points.   
 
Equipment and Software 
Business outlays for equipment and software  (E&S) appear to have increased at a 
significantly slower rate in th e fourth quarter than they did in the third quarter as 
expenditures for transportation and communicat ions equipment reversed some of their 
earlier sharp increase s.  Averaging through those two qua rters, we estimate that E&S 
spending rose solidly in the second half of 2005.  In addition, underlying fundamentals 
should support ongoing gains in cap ital spending:  Business ou tput continues to expand, 
                                                 
7 Because of a change in the sampling frame, the average price of new home s sold in 2005 is not 
comparable to the average pr ice in 2004.  Therefore, the change in  average prices shown in the chart is 
missing in January 2005.

firms remain flush with cash, and relative pric e declines continue to  drive down the user 
cost of capital equipment.  Furthermore, an ecdotal reports, business surveys, and our 
business contacts offer optimistic readings  on near-term capital spending plans. 
 
Business outlays for motor vehicles appear to have declined in the fourth quarter after 
having increased at a rapid pace in the sec ond and third quarters of 2005.  Individual 
purchases by firms, like consumers, swung back down when employee pricing programs 
ended.  However, fleet sales of light vehicl es and sales of medium and heavy trucks 
(classes 4 to 8) all stood at high levels in the fourth quarter; part of the recent increase in 
demand for heavy trucks probably reflects a pu lling forward of purchas es in advance of 
new EPA regulations on engines slated to take  effect in January 2007.  The indicators of 
truck demand suggest further strengthening in the near term:  In December, the 
three-month moving average of new truck orders increased to its hi ghest level since 1998, 
and order backlogs moved up markedly.  Mean while, business purchases  of aircraft likely 
fell again in the fourth quarter.  Smoothing through the lumpiness in the monthly data, 
shipments of aircraft by domestic producer s in October and November were about 
unchanged from the previous quarter, but more of the jets were sent abroad to foreign 
carriers.  Nevertheless, with the orders back log having risen so much  over the past year, 
purchases are likely to step back up in the near term. 
 
In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computing equipment remained high in 
November after having posted a large gain in  October, and orders moved up sharply in 
November.  Coupling the strength in shipments with continued declines in computer prices, real expenditures look set for an appr eciable gain in the fourth quarter after a 
somewhat lackluster increase in  the third quarter.  By cont rast, shipments data suggest 
that real expenditures on communications eq uipment turned down modestly last quarter 
after having posted an increase of  28 percent (annual rate) in th e third quarter.  Orders of 
communications equipment continued their erra tic pattern, posting an  8.5 percent decline 
in November after an even la rger October increase.  Looking  into this year, respondents 
to the December CIO Magazine  Tech Poll predicted a solid increase in nominal high-tech 
spending through December 2006. 
 
Apart from high-tech and transportation e quipment, nominal shipments of nondefense 
capital goods moved up for a fourth consecuti ve month in November, and the average

level of shipments in October and November  stood 2½ percent (not at an annual rate) 
above the third-quarter aver age.  Increases in forei gn demand for capital equipment 
apparently drew a larger share of shipme nts abroad, and we estimate that spending by 
domestic businesses rose a bit more slowly last  quarter than the robus t third-quarter pace.  
New orders for this category of equipmen t—which rose in August, September, and 
October—retreated sharply in November; nevertheless, the backlog of unfilled orders 
narrowed only slightly, and the long pipeline of projects al ready in train should provide 
momentum for shipments in coming months.   
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Although vacancy rates for nonres idential properties have dr ifted down a bit during the 
past two years, real spending on new construc tion has yet to gain traction.  The vacancy 
rate for office buildings stood near 12 percent in December, about 2¼ percentage points below its peak in the first quarter of 2004, but expenditures in this se ctor have continued 
to run at only about 60 percent of their 1999 levels.  Spending on commercial buildings 
has also held steady at a low level since the middle of 2002 despite persistently low 
vacancy rates in the retail sector (whi ch accounts for a major portion of spending on 
commercial buildings).  In addition, real ou tlays for structures in the manufacturing 
sector have changed little in recent quarte rs after increasing a b it at the end of 2004.  
 
In contrast to the other categories of nonr esidential spending, outlays on drilling and 
mining structures have continued to incr ease strongly, rising at an annual rate of 
18 percent in the third quarter.   Although the number of gas rigs in operation has edged 
down since October, the large increases in natural gas prices  over the past year suggest 
that expenditures on drilling and mining structures will continue to grow in the near term.  
 
Business Inventories 
Motor vehicle inventories were accumulated rapidly in the fourth quarter, reflecting the decline in light vehicle sales.  Outside of the motor vehicle sector, however, inventory investment seems to have remained low.  The book value of manufacturing and trade 
inventories excluding motor vehicles increased at an average annual rate of $34 billion in 
October and November, little different from the pace of accumulation seen in the second 
and third quarters.  Prices of goods held in  inventories—most notably petroleum-based 
products and many non-energy materials—have  fluctuated widely since Hurricane

Katrina hit the Gulf Coast last August.  With  many prices rising shar ply in October, the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis has estimated th at real manufacturing and trade inventories 
declined sharply that month after having posted meager accumulations in August and 
September; this decrease put real non-auto inventory accumulation on a weaker trajectory 
into the fourth quarter than it had followed earlier in the year.8  
 
The inventory readings of the past few months may still reflect a continuation of intentionally lower stockbuilding after th e strong accumulations seen in late 2004 and 
early 2005, but some of the recent weakness ma y also reflect supply interruptions after 
last year’s hurricanes.  In particular, the fraction of purchasing managers in the ISM 
survey who saw their customers’ inventories as too low rose in September and October, 
but that increase was reversed over the subse quent two months.  Overall inventory-sales 
ratios through November appeared generally in line with their downtrend over the past 
fifteen years.  The inventory-sales ratio for manufacturing and trade excluding motor 
vehicles moved down through October before inching up in November to a level a few notches below its third-quarter average.   
 
Information from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventory-consumption ratios outside of vehicl es and parts fell in December for a third 
consecutive month.  Inventories appear to remain well aligned with consumption in most 
industries other than paper products, in which stocks remain excessive. 
 
Federal Government Sector 
Data from the Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) for the fourth quarter indicate that 
defense spending was quite subdued after a larg e increase in the th ird quarter; indeed, on 
a NIPA basis, we estimate that real defense purchases plunged at a double-digit annual rate last quarter.  However, given the level of defense appropriations, the fourth quarter 
decline appears mostly to reflect volatility  in a typically choppy category of spending. 
 
In terms of the unified budget, the improvement in the federal budget stalled in the fourth quarter following several quarters of progress.  Outlays accelerated last quarter and were 
9½ percent higher than a year ea rlier, a result of both a sharp rise in interest outlays  
                                                 
8 We do not yet have November real inventory data.  Prices of goods held in inventories likely 
increased more modestly in November than in October.

                                                 (driven by the outsized increases in inflati on adjustments on Treasur y inflation-protected 
securities, or TIPS) and spending related to the hurricanes (inc luding $18 billion in 
expenditures by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster aid and 
national flood insurance).9  In contrast to the pickup in outlays, receipts decelerated last 
quarter, although the rate of increase in receipts was still sizable. 
 
In December, the Congress passed the fiscal 2006 defense bill, the last of the regular 
appropriations bills.  Besides providing fundi ng for defense, including a $50 billion down 
payment for this year’s spending on Iraq, the bi ll authorized $6 billion of new spending 
for hurricane relief, $4 billion to address th e avian flu, and a 1 pe rcent across-the-board 
cut in discretionary spending.  In addition, the Congress passed the Gulf Opportunity 
Zone Act, which cuts taxes by $4 billion in  2006 and $8 billion over five years.  The 
Senate and the House have passed virtually iden tical spending reconcili ation bills that cut 
mandatory spending an estimated $5 billion in 2006 and $40 billion over five years. 
 
State and Local Government Sector 
Data on the state and local sector indicate that real purchases rose modestly in the latter 
part of last year.  Employment rose 13,000 per month, on average, during the fourth quarter, a rate a bit lower than the average ove r the past two years.  Nominal outlays for 
state and local construction in October and N ovember stood at an annua l rate of 8 percent 
above the third-quarter averag e; although much of this nomin al increase likely reflected 
higher prices for construction-related mate rials, it may also have reflected some 
reconstruction and repair activity in the South. 
 
Moderate spending growth and robust tax co llections have contri buted to a further 
improvement in state and local budget balances.10  Fueled by strong gains in personal and 
corporate income tax payments, state tax receipts were 8 percent higher in the four quarters ending in 2005:Q3 than in the four quarters ending in 2004:Q3.  Over the same

coupon rate).  Both factors are record ed as interest outlays in the MTS. 
10 In the NIPA accounts, st ate and local net saving declined in 2005:Q3 because of one-time charges on 
government-sponsored enterp rises related to the hurricanes and a drop  in personal income tax receipts from 
the exceptionally high second-quarter reading.  But smoothing through the quarterly swings in personal 
taxes, we find that the budget situation has improved over the past year.

Prices and Labor Costs  
The overall CPI edged down in December, a re sult of small increases for food and core 
items and substantial declines, on balance, in  the volatile energy co mponents of the price 
index.  Translating these CPI data into an estimate of PCE prices for December, we 
estimate that overall PCE prices rose 2.7 pe rcent over the twelve months of 2005, about 
0.3 percentage point less than the increase during the preceding year.  Excluding food and 
energy, PCE prices appear to have risen 1.8 pe rcent last year, 0.4 pe rcentage point less 
than the increase during the preceding year; a deceleration in the erratic nonmarket 
components of this index accounts for all of that slowing.11
 
Large swings in energy prices have domi nated recent changes in headline consumer 
prices.  We estimate that the energy com ponent of PCE prices fell 2.3 percent in 
December after a drop of 8.6 percent in November.  However, survey data for gasoline point to an increase in Janua ry large enough to more than reverse the December decline 
in overall consumer energy prices.   The proj ected January increase in gasoline prices is 
due to the recent backup in crude  oil prices; gasoline inventor ies have run near the middle 
of the historical range for this time of year, and markups for gasoline are near normal 
levels.  In other energy markets, unseasonably warm weather of late has left stocks of 
natural gas near the high end of their historical range for this time of the winter, helping 
to drive down spot pri ces more than 40 percent since their peak in mid-December.  As 
production capacity continues to be below normal, however, prices may rise if the weather turns unseasonably cold for a few weeks.  Finally, re sidential electricity prices 
rose late in the year as electric utilities passe d through higher fossil fuel input costs. 
 
We estimate that the PCE price index for food rose 0.1 percent in December after a 
0.3 percent increase in the preceding month.  An  ample harvest and in creasing supplies of 
meats and poultry have moderated food prices over the past year.  Although the general 
trend in 2005 was a gradual al ignment of increases in food prices with core inflation, 
some disruptions in food markets occurred near  the end of the year.  Hurricane Wilma,  
 
11 Our estimates of December changes in the nonm arket prices are far less precise than are our 
estimates for the market-based components of PCE prices.

 which struck Florida in late October, damage d the winter crop of so me vegetables more 
than was initially reported, and the decline in supply has led to temporary spikes in prices 
for those goods.   
 
Core consumer price inflation has been modest .  Last summer, core PCE prices posted a 
string of very low increases, held down in part by falling motor vehicle prices.  More recently, core price increases have come up fr om those very low readings to moderate 
levels.  In December, we estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.1 percent; this increase would bring the three-month change to an a nnual rate of 1.7 percent—about the same as 
the twelve-month change.  As noted above, co re PCE inflation is estimated to have 
moved down 0.4 percentage point over th e past year.  The slowdown reflects a 
deceleration of about 2 percentage points in  the erratic nonmarket components of core 
PCE prices, which now seem to be increasing at a more moderate pace after bulging noticeably in the latter half of 2004 and in early 2005.  In contrast, core market-based PCE prices are estimated to have risen at th e same 1.7 percent pace as in the preceding 
year. 
   
Near-term inflation expectations edged lowe r in January, further reversing the sharp 
increases seen after the hurricanes in the fa ll.  The preliminary January reading on the 
Michigan SRC measure of median inflation ex pectations for the coming year ticked down 
to 3 percent.  Median five- to ten-year infl ation expectations moved down as well, to just 
under 3 percent.  By way of comparison, rate spreads on CPI-indexed Treasury bonds implied inflation compensation of about 2½ percent for both five- and ten-year maturities.  Although this level is up a b it from that in the December Greenbook, it 
remains toward the low end of the range seen over the past year. 
 
Last autumn’s sharp increases in energy pri ces still seem to be showing through to a 
number of inputs to production, though appa rently with somewhat less strength in 
December than in previous months.  In particular, prices for many energy-intensive intermediate products such as chemicals, pl astics, and nitrogenous fertilizers, which had 
risen sharply in October and November, genera lly posted smaller increases or declined in 
December.  For core intermediate material s as a whole, prices rose 0.3 percent in 
December after increases of 0.5 percent in November and 1 percent or higher in the 
preceding two months.  Notwithstanding the po st-hurricane increases in prices, the

4½ percent—was almost 4 percentage points below the rate of increase in the preceding year. 
 
Commodity prices have moved higher sinc e the time of the December Greenbook.  The 
Journal of Commerce  (JOC) metals index has risen 6 per cent, as declines for steel scrap 
have been more than offset by increases fo r other industrial metals.  The broader JOC 
industrial price index has moved up 3½ pe rcent since the last Greenbook, while the 
Commodity Research Bureau spot industrial index, which excludes energy items, has 
risen 7¾ percent.  Anecdotes are mixed as to whether hurricane-re lated reconstruction 
activity is having a notable effect on prices of construction ma terials.  Commodity prices 
for lumber and for plywood are both up, on net,  though we should note that these prices 
are measured in the West, and regional di sparities are sometimes important for these 
products.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Near-term expectations about monetary polic y held steady over the intermeeting period, 
but the anticipated path for the funds rate beyond the first half of this year moved down 
in response to statements by the FOMC that we re reportedly interpreted as indicating that 
the tightening cycle would end sooner than prev iously envisioned and to data that was 
viewed as consistent with benign inflati on and moderate output growth.  Yields on 
longer-dated Treasury securities d eclined a bit more than thos e at the shorter end of the 
term structure, resulting in a somewhat flat ter yield curve.  Credit spreads on corporate 
bonds barely budged.  Equity prices were a bout unchanged on net, as a run-up at the 
beginning of January was subsequently reversed  amid lackluster fourth-quarter earnings 
reports and a jump in oil prices.  Business and household credit quality appear to have remained solid.    
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Market participants widely anticipated the FOMC’s decision at the December meeting to 
raise the target federal funds ra te 25 basis points.  However, the removal of the reference 
to “policy accommodation” from the statemen t reportedly suggested to some investors 
that the tightening cycle might draw to a close sooner than th ey had previously 
anticipated.  The minutes of the December meeting seemed to reinforce that view, as 
investors pointed to the Committee’s assessmen t that “the number of additional firming 
steps required probably would not be large.”  Data indicating that core inflation remains 
low and that economic growth perhaps has been a bit softer than expected also appear to 
have contributed to a downward revision in policy expectations be yond the near term, as 
implied rates on longer-dated Eurodollar future s contracts declined 10 to 25 basis points, 
on net.  Even so, market participants conti nue to attach a very high probability to a 
25 basis point increase in the federal funds ta rget at the January m eeting, and they place 
about even odds on a similar increase in Ma rch.  After the middle of this year, the 
expected policy path begins to tilt down.  Uncertainty about future policy, as indicated by 
options on Eurodollar futures contracts, edged lower.  Over the intermeeting period, tw o- and ten-year nominal Trea sury yields declined about 
10 and 20 basis points, respectively, further narrowing the slope of the yield curve.  
Nevertheless, the current flat term structure is similar to that near the end of recent 
tightening episodes and, after adjustment for the level of short-term interest rates and the estimated low level of the term premium, the shape of the yield curve remains consistent 
with expectations of moderate economic grow th.  Inflation compensation rates implied by

III-3 
Treasury inflation-protected s ecurities (TIPS) have recently ticked up somewhat with the 
rise in oil prices but are little  changed, on net, over the period. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Major stock price indexes were about unc hanged, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period.  The recent spike in oil prices and the somewhat disappointing fourth-quarter 
earnings reports appear to have  offset the favorable effects of the revision in monetary 
policy expectations and the benign inflation data.  The equity risk premium—measured 
by the spread between the twelve-month fo rward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 
firms and a real long-run Treas ury yield—remained close to th e level that has prevailed 
for the past year.  Implie d volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 indexes 
moved higher but remain at the low end of their historical ranges. 
 Yields on investment-grade and high-yield co rporate bonds declined roughly in line with 
rates on comparable Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, and so their risk 
spreads were little changed.  In the comme rcial paper market, the difference between 
yields on thirty-day A2/P2- and A1/P1-rated paper remained low.  Year-end pressures on 
quality spreads were again subdued.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With nearly 150 of the S&P 500 firms repor ting, operating earnings per share for the 
S&P 500 in the fourth quarter ar e expected to have been ab out 14 percent above the year-
earlier level.  However, anal ysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings for the S&P 500 have 
been revised down over recent weeks given the notably cautious tone of forward-looking 
guidance, particularly in  the technology sector. 
 On net, the credit quality of nonfinanci al firms has remained strong, sustained by 
continued hefty profits, relatively low levera ge, and high liquidity on corporate balance 
sheets.  Credit rating changes in the fourth qua rter of last year were roughly balanced 
between upgrades and downgrades, and deli nquency rates on commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans remained low through the third quarter.  The six-month trailing bond default 
rate moved higher again in December owing to  the bankruptcy filing of Calpine, a large 
energy company.  However, the step-up in the default rate over the past few months has 
not reflected a widespread deterioration in cr edit quality, as most of  the recent defaults 
had been long anticipated by financial market s and the troubles have been confined to a 
few large firms.  In that regard, the expect ed aggregate year-ahead default rate based on 
the KMV model remained low in December.

Business Finance 
With a spate of offerings slated to finance acquisitions, gross bond issuance by 
nonfinancial firms strengthened in December a nd January but remained modest owing to 
firms’ ample internal funds and liquid assets .  Commercial paper outstanding contracted 
sharply in December, in part because a number of large multinational firms paid down their programs with repatriated profits.  In contrast, C&I loan growth strengthened a bit 
further, on net, in December and January.  All in all, net fi nancing across bonds, 
commercial paper, and business loans was a bit weaker in the fourth quarter than in the 
rest of last year.  Gross public issuance of equity rose in December, as seasoned offerings, led by the 
energy sector, increased to about  twice the average pace of la st year, but issuance fell 
back to its more modest pace in January.  Bo lstered by strong profits, equity retirements 
continued at a rapid rate late last year.  Retirements reached a record in the third quarter 
and are estimated to have fallen off only a l ittle last quarter.  Cash-financed mergers 
subsided somewhat in the fourth quarter, but repurchases are expected to have sustained 
their third-quarter pace as announcements of new repurchase programs set a record in the 
fourth quarter.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage borrowing in the four th quarter remained robust and brought the 
level of debt about 15 percent higher than that of a year earlier.  The issuance calendar for 
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMB S) suggests continued strength this 
quarter.  Spreads of BBB-rated CMBS over comparable Treasuries edged down, on net, 
over the period.  Movements in CMBS spreads during the past year have been roughly in 
line with spreads on similarly rated corporate bonds; therefore, the ge neral updrift in their 
spreads does not appear to signal particular  concerns about commercial real estate 
markets.  Delinquency rates have remained low by historical standards, and a decline in 
vacancy rates and some firming in rents point  to further improvement in fundamentals. 
 
Household Finance 
Average interest rates on thirty-year fixed-ra te mortgages have fallen slightly from their 
most recent peak in November, while rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages have 
hovered near recent highs.  Household mortga ge debt continued to grow rapidly during 
the third quarter, propelled in part by rapidly increasing hous e prices, and limited data for 
the fourth quarter show onl y a little abatement in mo rtgage borrowing.  Meanwhile, 
consumer credit was held down in October and November by elevated charge-offs related

to the surge in bankrup tcy filings before the implementation of new rules in mid-October.  
Smoothing through hurricane-related swings in disposable personal in come, the available 
evidence suggests that the financial obligations ratio in the fourth quarter rose a bit from 
its second-quarter level.1 
 After reaching unprecedented levels just be fore implementation of more-stringent 
bankruptcy laws in mid-October, weekly pers onal bankruptcy filings have remained low, 
as many of the pre-reform filings were appa rently pulled forward from future months.  
Indeed, according to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a significant 
portion of the fourth-qua rter increase in credit card char ge-offs related to the bankruptcy 
wave was accounted for by individuals and househol ds that were judged as likely to have 
otherwise filed sometime in the near future .  The survey results and commentary related 
to banks’ fourth-quarter earnings  reports also leave open the possibility that some of the 
bankruptcies last quarter were unexpected, presumably reflecting a pull in of filers due to 
the law change rather than a deterioration of credit qua lity.  Meanwhile, delinquency 
rates on residential mortgages, credit car ds, and auto loans have remained low, 
suggesting that underlying household credit  quality trends remain favorable. 
 After the solid increase in the ratio of househol d net worth to income in the third quarter, 
stock price gains again supported that ratio last  quarter.  Net purchases of equity mutual 
funds were strong in November and December,  as substantial inflows to international 
funds continued and inflows to domestic funds rebounded. 
 
Treasury and Agency Financing 
The Treasury auctioned two- and five-year nom inal notes and ten- and twenty-year TIPS 
over the intermeeting period.  The share of indi rect bids awarded at the five-year auction, 
a proxy for demand from foreign official inst itutions, was below average, while indirect 
bidder participation was more  robust at the TIPS auctions.  Other news over the 
intermeeting period about demand for Treasur y securities from foreign investors was 
somewhat mixed:  The amount of Treasuries he ld in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York on behalf of foreign official  institutions was about  unchanged, but the  
                                                
 
1 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ur ged the largest credit card lenders it regulates to 
adopt new formulas for minimum payments by the end of 2005.  This change was intended to encourage households to pay off their credit card debt in a timelier manner.  However, preliminary staff analysis suggests that these new formulas are unlikely to materially affect household financial obligations in the 
aggregate because, under the new fo rmula, the required rate of repayment for credit card debt for the 
average household is similar to the 2½ percent already required by most lenders.

Treasury International Capital System report for November indicated increased purchases 
of Treasury securities from both official  and private foreign investors.   
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight announced in December that Fannie 
Mae had satisfied its previous agreement to ma intain an excess of at  least 30 percent over 
minimum capital requirements, which fueled  speculation that Fannie Mae might soon 
resume expansion of its portfolio.  Fannie Ma e’s share price jumped about 10 percent in 
early January after news that the investigator in that firm’s internal probe had discovered 
no new accounting problems.  Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s debt spreads over 
Treasuries edged down, on net, ove r the intermeeting period.   
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term  municipal bonds in December about matched the robust 
average rate posted earlier in the year, but, as in previous years, issuance in January has 
been muted.  The credit quality of municipa l bonds remained stable, as upgrades about 
matched downgrades in December.  Yields moved in line with Treasuries, leaving yield ratios about unchanged.  
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded moderately in December and broug ht M2 growth for the fourth quarter to 
about 5¼ percent at an annual rate, a somewhat  faster pace than would be expected from 
the historical relationships among money grow th, nominal income, and opportunity cost.  
Staff estimates suggest that some of the unexp ected rise in the four th quarter was due to 
the effects of Hurricane Katrina, including re lief payments to individuals by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and funds a dvanced to hurricane vi ctims against likely 
future settlements by insurance companies.  M2 grow th is expected to pick up in January.       
 Bank credit grew at an annual rate of about 8½ percent in December, boosted by a 
significant acceleration in loans.  C&I loans continued to expand at a brisk pace and grew 
at an almost 10 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.  Respondents to the January 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported some further easing of lending standards 
and terms for C&I loans as well as stronge r demand for those loans over the previous 
three months.  The stronger demand was attr ibuted to borrowers’ increased needs to 
finance mergers and acquisitions, accounts re ceivable, and investments in plant and 
equipment.  The growth of residential and commercial mortgage loans picked up 
noticeably in December, but the pace for la st quarter as a whol e nonetheless edged down 
from the third quarter.  Credit card charge-offs  jumped at several la rge banks, reflecting

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The January 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  In addition, the survey contained a special 
question on changes in selected terms on co mmercial real estate loans over the past 
year. The survey also asked banks about th e extent to which the spike in bankruptcy 
filings in September and early October aff ected fourth-quarter charge-offs on credit 
card loans.  Finally, banks were queried a bout their expectations for changes in asset 
quality in 2006. This appendix is based on responses from fifty-four domestic banks 
and nineteen foreign banking institutions.  Domestic commercial banks reported a fu rther net easing of lending standards and 
terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) lo ans and no change in lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the past th ree months.  For the same period, a notable 
net percentage of domestic institutions reported stronger demand for C&I loans from 
large and middle-market firms, but only a small net fraction of domestic respondents experienced increased demand for commercia l real estate loans.  Significant net 
fractions of domestic banks reported that, si nce the last survey, demand for mortgages 
to purchase homes was weaker, as was demand for consumer loans.   Significant net fractions of respondents reported that they had eased selected terms on commercial real estate loans in 2005.  Banks cited more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most  important reason for having done so.  
Among banks that experienced an increase in  credit card charge-offs in the fourth 
quarter of 2005 as the result of the introduction of the new bankruptcy law, about three-quarters of respondents indicated that less than 40 percent of fourth-quarter charge-offs were attributable to this increase.  In a ddition, banks accounting for more than one-half 
of credit card loans on respondents’ books at th e end of the third quarter reported that 
between 60 percent and 100 percent of the in crease in the fourth-quarter charge-offs 
that reflected the introduction of the new law was attributable to households or individuals who would have filed for bankruptcy anyway later in 2005 or during 2006. 
 Looking ahead, banks indicated that, on balance, they expect loan quality on loans to businesses and households to deteriorate somewhat in 2006.  
Business Lending  
Domestic banks indicated that they had fu rther eased standards and terms on C&I loans 
over the past three months.  On net, about 10 percent of domestic institutions indicated 
that they had eased credit standards on C&I lo ans to large and middle-market firms,

roughly the same net fraction as in the October 2005 survey.  Almost one-half of 
domestic respondents reported that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their 
cost of funds for such firms, and about 30 pe rcent of domestic institutions indicated that 
they had reduced the costs of credit lines.  Do mestic institutions also reported that they 
had eased other lending terms to large and middle-market firms over the past three months:  On net, about one-fourth of ba nks reported that they had increased the 
maximum maturity of loans or credit lines, and almost one-fifth of respondents indicated that they had eased loan covenants.  The net percentages of banks that reported 
easing these loan terms were about the same as in the October 2005 survey.        For C&I loans to small firms, 8 percent of domestic respondents, on net, noted that they had eased their lending standards over the past three months.  On net, one-third of banks indicated that they had narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds.  About one-fifth of them, on balance, reporte d having reduced the cost of credit lines, 
and a similar fraction reported having increased the maximum maturity of loans or credit lines over the same period.  As they did in the previous survey, U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
reported that their standards on C&I loans had changed little.  However, significant net 
fractions of these institutions indicated that they had reduced the cost of credit lines, 
narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds, and increased the maximum 
maturity of loans or credit lines.      Nearly all domestic institutions that indi cated having eased their lending standards and 
terms in the January survey pointed to mo re-aggressive competition from other banks or 
nonbank lenders as an important reason for havi ng done so.  Notable net percentages of 
such respondents also cited an increased tolera nce for risk and increased liquidity in the 
secondary market for these loans as reasons for having eased credit standards or terms 
on C&I loans.  On net, almost one-fifth of domestic ba nks reported stronger demand for C&I loans 
from large and middle-market firms, roughly the same net fraction as in the previous survey.  By contrast, only 6 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported an 
increase in demand for C&I loans from small fi rms.  At U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks, about one-fifth of respondents, on net, indicated that demand for C&I 
loans had increased over the past three months.  Among the domestic respondents that experienced stronger demand for C&I loans, most cited borrowers’ increased needs to finance accounts receivable and mergers and 
acquisitions.  Substantial fractions of th ese respondents also pointed to customers’ 
 III-A-5   
 
 
increased needs to finance investment in plant and equipment and in inventories as 
contributing to the strengthening of business loan demand over the past three months.  All foreign institutions that experienced stronger demand for C&I loans cited increased 
needs to finance mergers and acquisitions; significant fractions of the foreign respondents also pointed to increased investment in inventories and in plant and equipment as important reasons for stronge r C&I loan demand.  Regarding future 
business, about one-fifth of domestic respondent s, on net, indicated that the number of 
inquiries from potential business borrowers had increased over the previous three 
months, a somewhat larger net fraction than in the October survey.  At foreign institutions, the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers was little changed in January.  On net, domestic institutions reported that  lending standards on commercial real estate 
loans were essentially unchanged over the past  three months.  However, a small net 
fraction of foreign respondents indicated that they had tightened standards on such loans. On net, 4 percent of domestic ba nks saw an increase in demand for commercial 
real estate loans, a somewhat smaller net fraction than in the October survey.  At 
foreign institutions, demand for this type of loan was reportedly unchanged in the 
January survey.  For several years, the January survey has ask ed banks to report their changes in various 
terms on commercial real estate loans over the past twelve months.  This year’s responses suggest a considerable easing in the terms on such loans, a pattern consistent 
with improving conditions in commercial real estate markets and the rapid expansion of 
commercial real estate loans in 2005.  Almost 30 percent of domestic institutions, on net, indicated that they had reduced spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds in 2005. 
In addition, one-fourth of domestic responde nts reported that they had raised the 
maximum size of the loans they were willing to extend, and almost one-fourth of them indicated that they had increased loan-to-va lue ratios and the maximum loan maturity 
over the past year.  At foreign institutions , 60 percent of respondents, on net, reported 
that they had narrowed spreads of loan ra tes over their cost of funds over the past 
twelve months.  In addition, 30 percent of foreign institutions, on net, indicated that 
they had increased loan-to-value ratios over the same period.     Domestic and foreign institutions that ha d eased terms on commercial real estate loans 
in 2005 cited more-aggressive competition fro m other banks or nonbank lenders as the 
most important reason for having done so.  Those respondents also pointed to 
 III-A-6   
 
 
improvements in the condition of, or the outlook for, the commercial real estate sector 
in the markets in which they operate as another important reason for having eased terms.  
Household Lending 
Credit standards on residential mortgage lo ans were reportedly unchanged over the past 
three months.  About 45 percent of domestic  banks, on net, reported weaker demand for 
mortgages to purchase homes, a notably larger ne t fraction than in the October survey.    
 More than 10 percent of domestic respondents— a somewhat larger fraction than in the 
October survey—indicated that their willingn ess to make consumer installment loans 
had increased over the past three months.  Standards and most terms on credit card and non-credit-card consumer loans were reportedl y little changed, on balance.  However, 
about one-fourth of respondents indicated that they had increased the minimum percent of outstanding credit card balances required to be repaid each month.  This change in 
lending practices likely reflected adjustments banks made in response to efforts by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to encourage the largest credit card lenders to 
boost minimum payments by the end of 2005.  Demand for consumer loans reportedly had weakened further over the past three 
months: Almost one-third of domestic ba nks, on net, saw weaker demand for such 
loans, up from about one-fifth in the October survey.   Bankruptcy filings spiked in September and early October in advance of the implementation of more-stringent bankruptcy  rules on October 17.  Special questions 
queried domestic banks about the effects of  that spike on charge-offs on credit card 
loans in the fourth quarter.
1  Among banks that experienced an increase in credit card 
charge-offs as the result of the new bankruptcy  law, one-half indicated that the portion 
of fourth-quarter charge-offs attributable to this increase was less than 20 percent, and 
about one-fourth indicated that the portion was between 20 percent and 40 percent.  
These two groups of banks accounted for about 20 percent to 50 percent, respectively, 
of all credit card loans on the books of responde nt banks at the end of the third quarter 
of 2005.  Three institutions indicated that the portion of fourth-quarter credit card charge-offs attributable to the deadline -related increase was between 80 percent and 100 
percent.  However, these institutions accounted  for 2 percent of all credit card loans on 
the respondents’ books at the end of the third quarter.  
                                                 
1 According to third-quarter Call Reports, the re spondent banks accounted for 35 percent of all 
credit card loans on the books of domestic commercial banks as of September 30, 2005. 
 III-A-7   
 
 
About one-third of banks reported that between 60 percent and 100 percent of the 
increase in credit card charge-offs related to the new bankruptcy law was attributable to 
borrowers who filed ahead of the Octobe r 17 deadline but who would have filed 
anyway at some point in 2005 or during 2006.  These banks held more than 50 percent of all credit card loans on the respondents’ books  at the end of the third quarter of 2005. 
 Institutions that accounted for more th an 25 percent of credit card loans on the 
respondents’ books reported shares of 40 per cent to 60 percent, and the remainder 
generally reported shares of 20 percent to 40 percent.   A final set of special questions asked banks a bout their expectations for the behavior of 
delinquencies and charge-offs on loans to  businesses and households in 2006 under the 
assumption that economic activity progresses in  line with consensus forecasts.  On 
balance, the responses suggest that banks e xpect some modest deterioration in loan 
quality this year from recent very high levels .  On net, about 30 percent of domestic 
respondents indicated that they anticipate that the quality of their loans to businesses—
including both C&I and commercial real estate loans—will deteriorate somewhat in 2006. Notable net fractions of domestic institu tions reported that they expect the quality 
of both credit card and non-credit-card consumer loans to deteriorate somewhat.  About 40 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they expect the quality of their nontraditional residential mortgages to dec line.  By contrast, only a few respondents 
reported that they anticipate a worsening of the quality of their traditional residential mortgages in 2006.  Foreign institutions indicat ed that, on net, they anticipate that the 
quality of their C&I loans will stabilize around current levels.  Only two foreign institutions expected the quality of their co mmercial real estate loans to deteriorate 
somewhat this year.

The average value of exports of goods and se rvices in October and November increased 
5½ percen t (a.r.) from  the third quarter, with  the pace of increase rough ly equal in bo th 
months.  In October, the increase in expor ts was more than accounted for by a sharp 
rebound in aircraft exports following a strike at Boeing in Septem ber.  In Nove mber, 
exports were boosted by a further increase in ai rcraft exports as well as sharp increases in 
exports of other capital g oods and consum er goods.  Following a steep plunge in 
Septem ber on account of  hurricane-related produ ction disruptions, exports of industrial 
supplies, particularly chem icals and petrol eum products, rem ained weak in October and 
recovered only slightly in Nove mber.  Se rvices exports were little changed in both 
October and Nove mber.    
 
The average value of imports in October and Novem ber increased nearly 17 percent (a.r.) 
from  the third quarter, as im ports in October surged from  an elevated Septem ber level

before falling back a bit in November.  Imports of oil and industrial supplies rose 
particularly strongly in Octobe r, following large increases in  September due in part to 
hurricane-related disruptions to domestic suppl ies.  In November, imports of both oil and 
industrial supplies retrea ted a bit, but remained above pre-hurricane levels.  Among other 
categories of goods, automotive imports were  strong in both October and November, 
whereas imports of consumer goods fell back steeply in November following only a 
modest gain in October, la rgely on account of a drop in the volatile pharmaceutical 
products category.  Imports of services increased in both months.    
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   Since the last Greenbook, we r eceived BLS trade price data for 
November and December.  After increasing 0.1 percent in November, BLS import prices of non-oil goods and of core goods were uncha nged in December.  In part, these price 
movements reflect large price fluctuations for natural gas.   Prices of imported non-oil 
industrial supplies increa sed 0.5 percent in November, as pr ices for imported natural gas 
rose, and then fell 0.2 percent in December as natural gas prices turned back down.  Compared to the core price index, prices for imported core goods excluding natural gas 
followed a somewhat different pattern–little changed in November and then increasing 
0.2 percent in December.  Prices for foods, feeds, and beverages rose 0.3 percent in 
November and 1.5 percent in December.  Over these two months, the price indexes for 
the remaining categories of core imports were  flat or declining.  Between October and 
December, prices for imported computer s fell 0.6 percent, whereas prices for 
semiconductors increased 1.0 percent. 
 
In the fourth quarter, the av erage level of BLS prices for imported core goods was 
7 percent at an annual rate above the third-quarter average.  With the November and 
December data being quite weak (see above ), the pick-up from the third quarter’s 
¾ percent inflation rate mainly reflected pri ce hikes in September and October.  The main 
contributor to the fourth-qua rter price increase was non-o il industrial supplies, which 
increased 32 percent (a.r.), pr imarily reflecting a surge in na tural gas prices in September 
and October.  Prices of imported core goods excluding natural gas rose 2¾ percent (a.r.), 
in the fourth quarter, following a declin e of ¼ percent in the third quarter.  
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil fell 0.9 percent in December, following a 
9.2 percent decline in November.  The averag e spot price of West  Texas Intermediate 
(WTI) crude oil rose 1.9 percent in December to about $59.40 per barrel.  The spot price

of WTI edged up late in the month and then rose sharply in Januar y, as the diplomatic 
fight over Iran's nuclear program escalated, rebels threatened oil production infrastructure 
in Nigeria, and violence and production pr oblems in Iraq worsened.  In addition, a 
dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natura l gas supplies raised concerns about the 
reliability of Russia as an energy supplier.  The spot price of WTI closed on January 24 at 
$66.75 per barrel. 
 
Exports.   Having fallen 0.7 percent in Nove mber, the prices of U.S. exports of total 
goods and of core goods rose 0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively, in December.  The decrease in export prices in November was led by a 2.2 percent decline in prices of 
exported non-agricultural indus trial supplies, which mainly reflected a steep decline in 
petroleum and petroleum product prices.  In December, prices of exported non-
agricultural industr ial supplies and capital goods  (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) increased 0.2 percent, more than offsetting a decline in prices of 
agricultural products and cons umer goods.  Between October and December, prices of 
exported computers and semiconductors fe ll 2.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively.  
 
The average level of core export prices in th e fourth quarter was 4½ percent at an annual 
rate above the third quarter av erage, as prices increased in  all sub-categor ies with the 
exception of agricultural products .  N
on-agricultural industrial supplies were the main 
contributor to the overall price increase, rising 13 percent.   
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) slowed slightly in Nove
mber but remained at historically high levels.  
Net inflows from the G-10 countries and the E CB (line 1a) increased a bit, while inflows 
from OPEC countries (line 1b) decreased by a similar amount.  Inflows from other 
countries (line 1c) were only slightly lo wer on net  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
.

Given the data in hand, foreign official inflow s in the second half of  2005 are on track to 
be slightly higher than those in the first six months, though official inflows for all of 2005 
are significantly lower than those recorded fo r 2004.  Most of the decrease this year can 
be attributed to the cessation of two years of Japanese interventi on and the associated 
inflows.   
 
It has been widely reported in the press that these monthly transactions data may 
understate inflows from official sources becau se they erroneously at tribute some foreign 
official flows to the foreign private sector.  It  is true that there is some misattribution in 
these data if official agencies use a foreign intermediary to acquire U.S. assets.  To the 
extent possible, BEA corrects for this misattr ibution in quarterly balance of payments 
statistics using data from FRBNY and else where, and these corre ctions are carried 
through to the monthly data shown in the table.  Nonetheless, there may be some 
remaining misattribution. 
 
Much of what press reports consider misattribution is in f act a misundersta nding of what 
the financial accounts are designed to report.  The financial account s reflect changes in 
claims on the United States, which are distinct from changes in dollar exposure.  For example, dollar deposits in London banks repr esent dollar claims on the U.K. private 
sector.  To the extent that a U.K. bank then  uses these deposits to acquire claims on the 
United States, they represent claims of the U.K. private sector on the United States.  
Thus, when a foreign official agent increas es its dollar deposits in a London bank, it is 
taking on additional dollar exposure without acquiring an additional claim on the United 
States.  In general, transactions among fore igners (such as those among foreign exporters, 
foreign official agents, and foreign banks) are not U.S. balance of payments transactions 
even if they are in dollar de nominated assets, and therefore should not be included in the 
U.S. financial accounts. 
 
Foreign private purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) picked up further in November on 
record private purchases of Treasury securiti es (line 4a) and continued strong flows into 
corporate bonds (line 4c).  Most of the net inflows are attributed to the United Kingdom, 
providing little information a bout the residence of the ultimate purchaser.  There was a 
slight net outflow in the t ypically volatile agency bond cat egory (line 4b) and a modest 
slowing in net purchases of equities (line 4d).  On net, average monthly foreign purchases 
of long-term securities in the second half of 2005 exceeded the al ready strong purchases 
recorded in the beginning of the year.  Fo r the first eleven months of 2005, total net 
IV-8 
foreign private acquisitions of U.S. secu rities totaled $645 billion, surpassing the net 
purchases recorded for all of 2004.  With these large purchases, foreign investors 
continued the trend of increasing their share of  the amount outstanding of each of the four 
types of U.S. securities shown in lines 4a through 4d. 
 
Purchases of foreign securities by U.S. reside nts (line 5) rebounded in November from an 
unusually low level in October, as  the appetite of U.S. investors for foreign equities (line 
5b), primarily Asian equities, reached a record level.  There were continued small net 
sales of foreign bonds (line 5a).  Year-to-date  purchases of foreign securities totaled $144 
billion and are near the level of purchases in 2004. 
 
Banking sector flows (line 3) continued to be volatile in November, with an outflow of 
$11 billion following inflows in several previ ous months.  Year-to-date outflows have 
totaled $24 billion, which is well within th e range of recent historical experience. 
 
Since the last FOMC meeting, BEA released balance of payments data for the third 
quarter, including direct invest ment flows and other data not  captured in the monthly 
reports on securities and banking flows.  The t ypical outflow of U.S. direct investment 
abroad (line 6) reversed sign to an inflow in response to the partial tax holiday 
established in the 2004 American Jobs Cr eation Act (also known as the Homeland 
Investment Act).  Under this one-fiscal-year  tax holiday, companies that repatriate 
previously retained earnings fr om foreign subsidiaries and re invest them in the United 
States are subject to a reduced effective tax rate on those earnings.  Sizeable repatriation 
of earnings began in the thir d quarter of 2005, after the Trea sury Department issued a 
series of guidelines through May.  By our es timate, foreign affiliates remitted $60 billion 
of previously retained earnings in the third quarter, which more than offset the usual $40 
billion in outflows associated with newly re invested earnings.  Fl ows of foreign direct 
investment into the United States (line 7) rebounded in the third quarter, returning to 
trend levels.  This third-quarter rebound re flects the reversal of  second-quarter inter-
company debt flows and some new equity inve stment.  As in previous quarters, three-
fourths of inflows originated in EU count ries and one-eighth originated in Japan.  
Merger-related inflows continued at the relativ ely subdued pace of the last several years. 
 
Overall, the third-quarter data show an unusua l increase in net privat e financial inflows to 
$230 billion, due mostly to sizeable net direct  investment inflows in addition to the high 
level of foreign purchases of U.S. securiti es.  These higher private inflows more than 
offset the decline in official flows.  With to tal financial inflows, both private and official, 
IV-9 
rising to $273 billion in the third quarter while the current account deficit was nearly 
unchanged at $196 billion, the statistical disc repancy swung from a positive $48 billion in

The dollar’s foreign exchange value agains t other m ajor currencies m oved down about 
2 percent on net over the inte rmeeting period.  D ownward pr essure on the dollar in the 
last week of Decem ber and the firs t week of January was prom pted in p art by 
lower-th an-expected U.S. ISM and p ayroll da ta for Decem ber and a redu ction in m arket 
expectations for the future path of U.S. inte rest rates.  On a bilater al basis, the dollar 
depreciated about 3 ½ percent against the yen, as econom ic data from  Japan continued to 
confirm  steady, solid growth.  The decline of the dollar against the yen essentially 
unwound a rise th at had occurred in the w eeks preceding the Decem ber FOMC m eeting.  
That strength had been attributed by m arket pa rticipants to a com bination of carry-trades 
and diversification of Japanese investm ent portfolios.  The dollar also depreciated 
3 percent on net against the euro, which wa s supported late in th e period by increasing 
expectations of m onetary ti ghtening by the ECB.  The dollar was little changed on 
balance against the Cana dian dollar and sterling.

The European Central Bank, the Bank of Engl and and the Bank of Japan did not change 
their m onetary policy stances over the interm eeting period.  The Bank of Canada raised 
its target for the overnight rate 25 basis poi nts, to 3.5 percent, on January 24.  Ten-year 
governm ent bond yields decreased in m ost industrial econom ies.  In the euro area, 
ten-year Germ an governm ent bond yields declin ed in the first two weeks of January, but 
they m oved back up late in  the intermeeting period after ECB Chief Econom ist Issing 
commented that “Alm ost all data show that the upswing is continuing and strengthening.” 
Mr. Issing also stated that oil prices, whic h rose to a four-m onth high, m ay spur an 
increase in inflation.  Market participants attribute the 22 basis point drop in the U.K. 
10-year yield in part to comm ents from the Bank of England’s chief econom ist Bean that 
were viewed as signaling that  policy m akers m ay lower in terest rates in th e com ing 
months.   
 
Over the interm eeting period, headline equity in dexes rose 2 to 5 percent in the euro area, 
United Kingdom  and Canada, and were little changed on net in the United States and 
Japan.  Japanese equity prices  experienced a large swing over the period.  They rose to a 
IV-13 
5-year peak in the first half of January but  later dropped on news of the investigation of 
Livedoor, a large internet services company, for accounting irregularities. 
Lower-than-expected earnings released by several large U.S. corpora tions also appeared 
to weigh on Japanese and U.S. e quity prices, as did an increa se in crude oil prices over 
the period.

Equity prices recorded strong increases in Latin America, where financial conditions for 
major U.S. trading partners continued to be  favorable.  The Brazilian central bank cut its

Over the intermeeting period the spot pri ce of gold soared $30 per ounce, to $557 per

shortfall in annual mining production and ri sing jewelry and investment demand.  The 
investment demand for gold rose on rumors th at some central banks, including those in 
Russia and South Africa, may seek to dive rsify their portfolios by increasing their 
holdings of gold.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
The firm pace of third-quarter activity in the foreign industrial countri es appears to have 
continued in the fourth quar ter.  Indicators of consumer  spending and sentiment have 
been positive on balance in each of the major foreign industrial countries.  Survey 
measures of business sentiment suggest opt imism in Japan and the euro area, and 
purchasing managers’ indexes (PMI) improved in Japan, the euro area, and the United 
Kingdom.  Employment growth in Canada was very strong in the fourth quarter, with the 
unemployment rate touching a 30-year low. 
 
Twelve-month rates of consumer price infl ation continued to recede in November and 
December.  The Bank of Canada continue d its tightening campaign with a fourth 
consecutive increase in its overnight rate. 
 
Third-quarter GDP growth in Japan  was revised down to 1 pe rcent (s.a.a.r.), as the 
contribution from inventory investment was revised to -1.4 percent following a 
preliminary estimate of a slight positive c ontribution.  However, monthly indicators of 
activity in the fourth quarter have been positive.  Indus trial production rose  1.5 percent in 
November, the fourth consecutive month of  positive growth, and the manufacturing PMI 
rose further in December.  Housing starts, machinery orders, and machinery shipments all posted increases in the fourth quarter.  Real  spending by households fell in November but 
remained 0.5 percent above its average leve l in the third quarter, and in December, 
consumer confidence rose to its highest level since 1991.  Average real exports in 
October and November were 2.2 percent above their average level in the third quarter, 
and real imports were 1.1 percent lower.

The Bank of Japan's Tankan diffusion index of business conditions for firms of all sizes 
and industries rose three points in December  to 5, consistent with a moderate but steady 
rate of growth over the next year.  Firms re vised their projections of investment spending 
growth for the current fiscal year to 9.1 percent, up 3.1 percentage points from the 
September survey.  Reported annual employme nt growth rose and the diffusion index of 
excess employment conditions i ndicated a tighter labor mark et.  Projections of sales 
growth were revised up by all firms.  
 
Overall consumer prices fell 0.8 percent in November from a year earlier.  Core 
consumer goods prices, which exclude volat ile food prices but include oil, were up 
0.1 percent from a year earlier; however this positive rate of core inflation was due in 
large part to base-year effects – core consum er prices fell 0.1 percent from the previous 
month’s level.  The Tokyo consumer price index, which is repor ted one month earlier 
than the national price index, rose 0.1 percen t in December from the previous month but 
IV-17 
fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier.  No minal wages rose 0.5 percent in November 
compared with the same month a year earlie r.  Although the unemployment rate edged up 
to 4.6 percent in November, there is anecdotal evidence linking the rise to a greater 
willingness of some employees to quit and s eek better employment options.  Despite the 
rise in the unemployment rate, the offers-to- applicants ratio (the number of officially 
posted job openings relative to the number of o fficially registered job seekers) rose to a 
thirteen-year high.   
 
In the euro area , industrial production rebounded to a new high in November, and 
forward-looking indicators of activity continued to strengthen.  Survey measures of 
business sentiment improved further in December and January to the best levels since 2000.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI rose  to 53.6 in December from 52.8 the 
previous month.  The pickup in the euro-ar ea economy appears to be spreading beyond 
just manufacturing, with the services PMI al so jumping in December, to 56.8 from just 
over 55 the previous month.  In Germany, ne w manufacturing orders  posted a strong 
increase in November, and German industria l production in November gave back only a 
small part of the very large gains of th e previous two months.  German business 
sentiment suggests a continuati on of these positive trends, w ith the IFO business climate 
index surging in December and January to a le vel just shy of the previous cycle’s peak 
reached in May 2000.  In contrast, with Fren ch businesses experien cing less of an export 
boom than in Germany, the French INSEE bus iness climate index was flat in December 
and January and is a bit below the year-ago level.

It now appears that euro-are a firms, especially those in  Germany, are gaining enough 
confidence in the durability of the recovery  and in the soundness of their balance sheet 
positions to begin to spend on capital invest ment and business services.  Hiring of new 
workers tends to lag behind capital spending, but  there are some early indications that the 
labor market is improving.  The European Co mmission’s measure of consumer sentiment 
picked up further in December, largely becau se of a strong improvement in consumers’ 
perceptions of employment prospects.  However, the euro-area unemployment rate 
remained at 8.3 percent in November  for the third straight month.   
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation continued to edge down, to 
2.2 percent, in December from a recent high of 2.6 percent in September.  Core inflation, 
excluding energy and unprocessed food remain ed around 1.5 percent.  The European 
Central Bank kept policy unchanged at its Ja nuary 12 meeting, and ma rket expectations 
of further near-term rate hikes were reduced a bit by ECB President Trichet’s post-
meeting comments that emphasized the downside risks to euro-area growth. 
 
The preliminary estimate of four th-quarter GDP growth in the United Kingdom was 
2.6 percent.  Manufacturing output  in the fourth quarter fe ll by 0.6 percent, which was 
IV-19 
partly offset by a 1.3 percent rise in mini ng and quarrying (which includes oil and gas 
extraction).  Services output gr ew by 0.9 percent, slightly fast er than in the third quarter. 
 
Other indicators for the fourth quarter were generally positive for the United Kingdom .  
The PMI for manufacturing squeaked above the 50 mark in third quarter and hovered just 
above 51 throughout the fourth quarter.  The se rvices PMI, after remaining essentially 
unchanged near 55 through most of 2005, jumped to 58 in December.  
 
Retail sales accelerated in the f ourth quarter.  On the downside, after dipping in October, 
consumer confidence failed to rebound in November and December.  Consumer credit 
(credit not secured on dwellings) fell slightly  in November, with the decline driven by 
reduced credit card lending.   
 
House prices have been rising in recent months, after having been roughly unchanged for 
much of the previous year.  In December,  the Nationwide and Halifax indexes of house 
prices rose on a twelve-month basis 3.2 a nd 5.6 percent, respectiv ely.  Lending secured 
on dwellings rose 0.9 percent in November.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation fell in December to 2 percent, the 
Bank of England’s target.  The twelve-month ra te of inflation excluding energy also fell, 
from 1.6 percent in November to 1.4 percent in December. 
 
Data for Canada  suggest economic activity remained firm in the fourth quarter.  The 
composite index of leading indicat ors accelerated throughout the quarter.   Housing starts 
ended the year on a strong note, and 2005 housin g starts were the s econd-highest in the 
past 18 years, topped only in 2004.  Retail sa les in November posted a second straight 
advance.   Average real exports and imports in October and November were both about 
10 percent (a.r.) above their average third-qua rter average.  The manufacturing sector, 
however, continued to struggle, as manufacturing shipments fell in November in real 
terms for the third time in four months, a nd, following a strong October, manufacturers 
IV-21 
received fewer new orders in November.  The PMI retreated in December, following a 
strong cumulative gain over the previous three months. 
 
Although employment dipped slightly in December, fourth-quarter job gains were the 
strongest in six quarters, continuing the solid labor market performance of the past few 
years.  After unemployment touched a 30-year  low of 6.4 percent in November, it crept 
back up to 6.5 percent in December.  The manufacturing sector remains the biggest 
source of weakness in the labor market, cont inuing to experience large job losses.   
 
In December, the twelve-mont h rate of consumer price inflation was 2.2 percent.  
Gasoline prices, which fell sharply in Octobe r and November, were flat in December, 
which pushed the twelve-month inflation rate up slightly from 2 percent in November.  
The twelve-month rate of core inflati on, which excludes the eight most volatile 
components, edged down to 1.4 percent.  
 
In January, the Bank of Canada increased the targeted overnight rate 25 basis points to 
3.5 percent, following 25-basis-point increases at each of its previous three meetings.  
This move was widely expected.  In its accompanying statement, the Bank said that 
“…some modest further increase in the policy interest rate…” would be required to keep 
inflation on target.

In federal elections held January 23, the Conservative party won 124 out of 308 
Parliamentary seats, and Conservative Leader  Stephen Harper will become the country’s 
twenty-second prime minister.  The Conserva tive win ends the 12-year reign of the 
Liberal party, which took 103 seats.  The Cons ervatives now face the task of forming the 
country’s second consecutive minority government.  The previous minority government,

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Activity in Asia in the fourth quarter c ontinued to be generally robust, supported by 
strong Chinese performance and by global dema nd for electronics.  Indicators in Latin 
America, in contrast, were mixed.  In Mexi co, the industrial sector  has shown signs of 
recovery, although recent data releases have been a bit disappointing.  Economic activity 
in Brazil showed continued weakness, wh ile Argentina saw strong growth but high 
inflation.  The emergence of the bird flu in a remote area of Turkey has resurrected fears 
of a flu pandemic, but the economic effect remains limited.  
 
Chinese  real GDP rose more than 11 percent (staff estimate) in the fourth quarter.  
Coupled with revision to recent quarters, this brought 2005 real GDP growth to 
9.9 percent, just a step below last year’s pace.  While industrial production surged in 
December, investment and retails sales d ecelerated in recent m onths, although growth 
remained elevated.  Export growth also slowed somewhat in recent months.  
Nevertheless, the Chinese trade surplus for 2005 exceeded $100 billion, more than three 
times the surplus of the previous year.  For the year as a whole, both export and import 
growth slowed from the pace of recent y ears, but import growth fell by half, whereas 
export growth slowed only modestly.  Consum er price inflation moved up a tad in recent 
months, with twelve-month rate of infl ation ending the year at 1½ percent. 
 
The Chinese government released the result s of the economic censu s undertaken in 2004, 
revising upward 2004 nominal GDP about 17 percen t, owing in large part to a sizeable 
upward revision in service sector output.  R eal GDP growth was also revised up about 
½ percentage point per year on averag e over the last twelve years.

Recent data from Hong Kong  suggest that activity in the f ourth quarter slowed from the 
very rapid growth seen earlier last year, as  the boost to investment and consumption from 
the completion of Hong Kong Disneyland appears to have waned somewhat.  The trade 
deficit widened a little in November, reflecting a small decline in exports and a slight rise 
in imports.  December unemployment remained at  its lowest level in four years.  Twelve-
month consumer price inflation edged up in recent months but ended the year below 
2 percent.

In Taiwan , incoming data suggest that fourth quarter growth remained at a heady pace 
following a strong third quarter , when real GDP expanded almost 7 percent (s.a.a.r.) 
mainly as a result of export growth and inventory accumulation.  Fourth-quarter 
industrial production was up 4.5 percent from the third quarter, and new orders for 
electronics remained elevated in December.  Exports surged to a new high in December, boosted by soaring high-tech exports, and im ports edged down, contributing to a sharp 
expansion of the monthly trade surplus.  The unemployment rate has inched down in 
recent months.  Consumer price inflation ende d the year at 2.2 percent on a twelve-month 
basis.

Korean  growth continued to be strong, with real GDP jumping 7.2 percent in the fourth 
quarter, bringing output 5.4 per cent above its level a year ago.  Consumer demand 
remained robust in the fourth quarter, and business fixed investment and net exports posted strong gains.  In December, the Bank of Korea unexpectedly raised its policy rate, 
indicating that core inflation likely would exceed  its target in the latter half of 2006, but 
the Bank left rates unchanged in January.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation 
increased a touch in December to 2.6 percent but core inflation ende d the year at about 
2 percent, below the central bank’s target of 2½ to 3½ percent.  
   
Following the sharp appreciation of the won, in early January, officials from several 
government bodies issued a warning that the Bank of Korea and Financial Supervisory 
IV-29 
Service would take action against speculative ac tivity.  Officials also announced they had 
decided to ease restrictions on Korean nationals ' purchases of foreign real estate and raise 
caps on individual overseas investments.  Mo reover, the government indicated that it 
would liberalize further by eliminating these caps altogether by the end of this year.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries suggest that economic activity continued to 
expand at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year .  In Singapore, the advance 
estimate of fourth-quarter real GDP (unofficial) indicates that the economy expanded 
nearly 10 percent, fueled by a robust performance in the biomedical sector and healthy 
global demand for electronic products.  A str ong electronics PMI read ing for the fourth 
quarter suggests expansion in activity going fo rward.  Elsewhere in the region, industrial 
production for recent months was up on ba lance in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the 
Philippines.  In Thailand, industrial produc tion was down, mostly because of temporary 
closures of chemical and petroleum production plants for maintenance. 
 
Even though consumer price inflation eased a bi t, it remained elevated in several parts of 
the region, mostly reflecting higher importe d energy prices and a reduction in fuel 
subsidies (particularly in Indonesia).  Citi ng the moderation in in flation and the recent 
strong appreciation of the rupiah, Bank Indone sia left its policy rate unchanged at its 
latest meeting, having raising it 400 basis poi nts, to 12.75 percent, in five consecutive 
moves between August and December.  In contra st, the Thai central bank raised its key 
IV-30 
interest rate 25 basis points at each o f its Decem ber and Janu ary m eetings.  The policy 
rate stands at 4.25 percent, up 300 basis points since the ti ghtening began in August 2004, 
but the central bank suggested that the tightening episode is reaching its end.

Data for India indicate that economic activity continue d to be robust.  Average industrial 
production over October and November was up 3½ percent from the third quarter, 
boosted by strong growth in consumer goods output.  The fourth-quarter merchandise 
trade deficit narrowed, as exports remained he althy and imports moderated a touch.  Both 
consumer price inflation and wholesale price inflation moved up from the third quarter.  
At its January meeting, the central bank ra ised its policy rate 25 basis points to 
5.5 percent, citing inflationary pressures posed by expected  strong growth and higher oil 
prices.

In Mexico , performance in the industrial sector was a bit disappointing in the fourth 
quarter, given strong growth in U.S. manufacturing activity.  Indus trial production rose 
just 0.3 percent in November, bringing aver age production for October and November up 
1.6 percent from the third quarter, an increase that was smaller than had been anticipated.  
On the other hand, vehicle production surged in December, a good sign, given that this 
sector had been particular ly weak earlier in 2005.  
 
Consumer price inflation remained well with in the Bank of Mexico’s 2-to-4 percent 
target range.  Twelve-month consumer pric e inflation was 2.9 percent in November, the 
lowest on record, and edged up to 3.3 percent in  December on the back of a jump in some 
food prices.  Twelve-month core inflation (not  shown) stayed at 3.1 percent in November 
and December.  The softness in manufacturing and the benign inflation prospects led the 
Bank of Mexico (BOM) to continue easi ng policy in December; the BOM has eased 
policy five times since August.  As a result, the rate on 28-day peso-denominated bills, a 
widely used measure of the monetary policy stance, has fallen from 9.6 percent in August 
to 7.7 percent in late January.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Gree nbook point to con tinued weakness in 
economic activity following a sharp decline in  GDP in the third quarter.  November 
industrial production was up about ½ percent,  less than expected, and the October-
November average was down 0.7 percent from its  third-quarter level.  Retail sales in 
November were soft.  Monthly headline inflat ion in December declined to 0.4 percent, as 
the effects of the September hike in domes tic prices of vehicle fuels waned, bringing 
twelve-month inflation down to 5.7 percent.  However, increases in prices of food and 
prices of some types of ener gy (fuel ethanol and electricity) have put upward pressures on 
inflation in recent weeks, raising concerns. 
 
The Brazilian central bank has continued th e monetary easing begun last September, 
reducing the target for the policy rate, the Selic rate, 50 and 75 basis points at the 
December and January meetings.  The Selic ra te now stands at 17.25 percent, down from 
19.75 percent last September.  In December, the Brazilian government prepaid 
$15.5 billion in loans from the IMF, a move aimed at improving prospects for a credit 
rating upgrade.  However, the government succu mbed to pressures to raise the minimum 
wage nearly 17 percent, which will increas e the deficits of the pension systems.

In Argentin a , data releases point to continued re covery.  The monthly index of economic 
activity, which has closely tracked  real GDP growth in recent years, suggests  that output 
in the fourth quarter likely continued to expand at close to the third quarter’s robust 
10 percent pace.  Industrial production over October-November averaged 2.2 percent 
above its third-quarter level.  Consumer price inflation remained high, ending 2005 at 
over 12 percent on a twelve-month basis, well above the central bank ’s informal target 
range of 5 to 8 percent.  (The  central bank’s 2006 inflation pr ojection is 8 to 11 percent.)  
. 
 
In early January, the government prepaid $10 billion in IMF  debt out  of international 
reserves.  The payment lowered the governme nt’s gross debt-to-GDP ratio from roughly 
72 to 66 percent, excluding the $20 billion in de faulted debt held by creditors who did not 
accept the government’s debt exchange last  year.  Although the prepayment followed a 
similar move by Brazil, the Argentine government’s decision comes against a 
background of a contentious re lationship with the IMF and raised concerns that the 
Kirchner government will pursue more unorthodox economic policies.

In Venezuela , reliable data on activity are scarce, but anecdotal evidence suggests that 
economic activity was strong in the fourth  quarter, supported by the high price of 
petroleum and by expansionary fiscal and moneta ry policies.  Inflati on ended the year at 
over 14 percent on a twelve-month basis, down fr om a year earlier, but still very high.  
President Chavez, who faces re-election next December, proposed in January to raise the 
wages of public sector workers 80 percent, heightening concerns about the poor policy 
environment.

Turkish real GDP rose 7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier a nd indications 
are that this pace of growth continued in the fourth quarter, while inflation ended the year 
at 7.7 percent.  Turkey has recently experi enced an outbreak of the bird flu that has 
infected 20 people and killed four.  A lthough 900,000 birds have been slaughtered in 
affected areas since late Decem ber, when the virus was detected in a remote region near 
the border with Iran, human-to-human tran smission has not been identified and the 
economic effects so far appear to be minima l.  A concern is th e potential effect on 
tourism, but it is still too early  to tell.  In mid-January, donor  countries pledged to provide 
$2 billion to help currently in fected countries and countries at risk contain the virus.
