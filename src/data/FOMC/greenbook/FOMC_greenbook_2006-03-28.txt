Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Economy activity appears to be expanding strongly  in the first quarter.  Private payrolls 
advanced solidly in January and February.  Consumer spending is on track to rise at a 
robust pace this quarter, and business purchases  of equipment and software have picked 
up appreciably.  Warm weathe r boosted housing construction in January and February, 
although sales have dropped back and house pr ices have decelerated a bit.  Headline 
consumer price inflation jumped in January but moderated last month as energy prices 
moved down.  Core inflation remains well contained. 
 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor demand continued to increase smartly  in February.  Private nonfarm payroll 
employment moved up 205,000 last month follo wing a similar-sized gain in January.1  In 
particular, financial activities, business serv ices, and nonbusiness services continued to 
add workers at a robust pace, and construction employment posted another sizable gain as 
weather conditions remained favorable.  A lthough the average workweek edged down to 
33.7 hours in February, the level of aggregat e hours for production or nonsupervisory 
workers, which has moved up noticeably in r ecent months, is sti ll 0.4 percent above the 
fourth-quarter average.    In the household survey, the unemployment rate  averaged 4¾ percen t over the first two 
months of this year, ¼ percentage point below its fourth-quarter aver age.  This signal of 
further tightening in the labor market is echoe d by several other labor market indicators.  
Both the number of persons working part time for economic reasons and the rate of 
insured unemployment—another measure of  the prevalence of active job seekers—
dropped slightly below their respective averag e levels set during the first half of 1997, a 
time when the labor market appeared to be r oughly in equilibrium.  Similarly, as reported 
by the National Federation of Independent Bu sinesses survey, the share of small firms 
with hard-to-fill positions is now about where it was in 1997.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemploymen t insurance was 297,000 for the week ending 
March 11, indicating that layoffs have been relatively low, alt hough the exhaustion rate 
suggests that the pace at which claimants are finding jobs befo re their benefits run out is 
still somewhat above its 1997 level.  In a ddition, the JOLTS job openings rate has been 
trending upward, on balance, over the past year, and Manpower’s i ndex of net hiring 
plans is at the high end of its recent range.   
                                                
 
1 The January employment report included the annual benchmark revision to the payroll survey, which 
lowered the level of total nonfarm payroll employment 158,000 in March 2005.  The revised data have 
been incorporated in the BLS measur es of hours worked in the nonfarm business sector, which are used in 
estimating productivity.

In contrast, the Conference Board’s measure of  job availability indicates that households 
do not yet perceive the availability of jobs to be  as great as it was in  the first half of 1997.  
Moreover, household expectations of labor ma rket conditions from the Michigan Survey 
indicate that households are cu rrently somewhat less optimistic about the future than they 
were a decade ago.  The staff estimates that output per hour fo r all persons in the nonfarm business sector 
declined at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in th e fourth quarter (a sli ghtly smaller decrease 
than the most recently published figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics).  We also 
estimate that productivity rose 2½ percent ov er the four quarters of 2005, about the same 
as in 2004.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production rebounded 0.7 percent in February after having declined 0.3 percent 
in January.2  This contour largely reflected a January plunge and February rebound in 
utilities output as temperatures turned ex ceptionally warm in January and then moved 
back to near seasonal norms last month.  Abstra cting from these swings in utilities output, 
industrial production posted a si zable gain in January before  flattening out in February, 
pointing to a solid rise for the first quarte r.  Manufacturing output was unchanged last 
month after a jump of 0.8 per cent in January.  The rate of capacity utilization in the  
                                                 
2 We estimate that hurricane-related activity—including both the resumption of production at 
hurricane-idled facilities and the increase in output spur red by rebuilding efforts—added little to the growth 
of total industrial output in February, after having contri buted a bit more than ¼ percentage point to the rate 
of change in January.

manufacturing sector stood at  80.4 percent in February, 0.6 percentage point above its 
1972-2005 average.  Mining output (which incl udes oil and gas extraction) slipped 
0.5 percent in February, after aver aging gains of 3 percent in the preceding three months.     
 Little further progress was made in February in  the restarting of oil and gas platforms that 
were shut in by Hurricanes Katrina and R ita.  As of March 22, domestic crude oil 
production was at about 93 percen t of its pre-Katrin a level, and natural gas extraction was 
at about 97 percent, both rates roughly unchanged fr om the end of January.
3  Complete 
recoveries for both oil and gas are expected to be attained in the second half of 2006.  
Regarding domestic refineries  affected by the hurricanes,  one Gulf Coast refinery, 
representing about 0.7 percent of domestic cap acity, remains out of service because of 
hurricane-related damage and is not expected to return to production until April, while 
another is still running at reduced rates.4  Overall, domestic crude oil production edged 
down in February.  Refinery output also decl ined last month, possibly in response to the 
elevated stocks of gasoline and other refine d products.  The most recent weekly physical 
output data for March suggest th at electricity generation is li ttle changed from February, 
crude oil production is rebounding from February ’s decline, and production at refineries 
continues to taper off.  Motor vehicle production has stepped down rece ntly.  Assemblies averaged a moderate 
11.6 million units at an annual rate in January and February—about 150,000 units below the fourth-quarter pace—and inventories of light vehicles edged down in January and 
February.  Although the days’ supply of light vehicles on dealer lots—at 68 days—is not 
far from its average in recen t years, anecdotal reports s uggest excess stocks at some 
automakers.  The assembly rate is scheduled  to remain at 11.6 million units in March and 
to average only 11.8 million units  in the second quarter.   
  
                                                
 
3 The Gulf Coast region accounts for nearly 30 percent of domestic crude oil extraction, about 
20 percent of natural gas extraction, and just under one -half of refining capacity.  After Hurricane Rita, all 
crude oil extraction and about 80 percent of natural gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in, as 
were similar shares of onshore production and near-off shore production (that is, output within three miles 
of the coast) in Louisiana. 
4 A third refinery (comprising about 2½ percent of  capacity) that was idled as Rita came ashore 
remains out of service for a safety overhaul.  In add ition, some refineries that delayed maintenance in the 
aftermath of the hurricanes to take advantage of high margins are performing maintenance now, before ramping up gasoline production for the summer driving season.  Unrelated to the hurricanes, two other 
refineries were pulled offline recen tly for unplanned maintenance that  is expected to be completed 
relatively soon.

Elsewhere in transportation, the rate of increas e in monthly civilian aircraft production is 
likely to slow in the next few months from the elevated pace that followed the end of the 
strike at Boeing.  
  After having increased at a rapid 
pace from the middle of 2000 to the end of 2005, military aircraft output declined in both 
January and February and will likely conti nue to decline in the coming months, as 
deliveries to the U.S. armed for ces are slated to ease in 2006. 
 After two quarters of fairly rapid increases , high-tech output cool ed, on balance, in 
January and February.  The output of se miconductors fell 1.1 percent in January—in 
large part because of a decline of nearly 8 percent in the production of microprocessor 
units (MPU)—but it recovered somewhat in Febr uary.  Recent reports from Intel indicate 
that MPU shipments were restrained in the fourth quarter by shortages of complementary 
semiconductors (chipsets), and the company is holding down MPU production in the first 
quarter to clear out the inve ntory accumulation that result ed from the problem.  The 
production of chips other than MPUs, where gains have been solid for some time, also slowed in January but picked up a bit in Febr uary.  The recent softness in chip production 
is likely temporary.  Industry analysts at  the Semiconductor Industry Association and 
Gartner recently upgraded their outlook fo r worldwide semiconductor sales in 2006, and 
bookings for equipment used to fabricate semiconductors have continued to climb.  The news regarding high-tech production dow nstream from semiconductors has been 
mixed.  On the one hand, the output of co mmunications equipment strengthened in the 
second half of 2005 and increase d considerably in January an d February.  Accordingly, 
capacity utilization at communications equipment producers, which plummeted to a low of 41 percent in 2002, rose further and recently  surpassed its historical average for the 
first time since April 2001.  On the other ha nd, after having posted modest increases in 
most of 2005, the output of computers rose  only a little in January and February. 
 Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech, production was little changed 
in February after strong gain s in the preceding four months.  The output of consumer 
goods, which had accelerated in the fourth quart er, rose moderately in January and then 
edged down in February.  The production of business equipment slowed in December and January from the blistering pace set in the second half of 2005 and was unchanged in February.  The production of construction suppli es changed little in February for the third 
straight month after very larg e increases last autu mn.  The output of business supplies has 
grown steadily in recent months but dipped 0.2 percent in February.  Materials

production increased sharply late  last year, boosted by the hur ricane-related recovery in 
chemical materials, but the rate of increase slowed in February. 
 
The indicators of near-term ma nufacturing activity are generally positive.  As reported by 
the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), th e diffusion index for new orders stood at a 
high level in February and thus pointed to si zable output gains in the coming months.  In 
addition, indexes for new orders from surv eys by FRB New York and FRB Philadelphia 
moved up in March and remain at a level cons istent with substantial near-term increases 
in manufacturing production.  In contrast, th e three-month moving av erage of the staff’s 
measure of real adjusted durable goods or ders, which is available only through January, 
suggests more-moderate production increases. 
 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles in the first two months of the year averaged 17.1 million units at an 
annual rate, which is even with December’s pace.  This relatively steady level—which 
stands a bit above the rate of 16.9 million units  recorded last year—follows a period in 
which sales fluctuated widely with the intr oduction, and end, of last summer’s employee 
pricing programs. 
 
  For March, Japanese 
automakers report that sales maintained a solid pace in the first twenty days, while industry analyst J.D. Power and Associates e xpects total sales this  month to record a 
modest rate of 16.4 million units, a touch below the February pace.  Near-term indicators of vehicle demand are cons istent with a moderate pace of activity in 
the sector.  Recent gains in income have b een appreciable.  The Michigan SRC index of 
car-buying attitudes, while edging down in March, remained well within the range of 
values recorded over the past year, and th e percentage of Conference Board Survey 
respondents planning to buy a new vehicle in  the next six months moved up to an 
elevated level in February.  Although the av erage level of incentives has been edging 
down, and the automakers maintain that they  intend to move further away from the 
generous programs observed in recent y ears, the Big Three firms have recently 
introduced several new programs in an effort to boost demand.

II-15 
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending appears to be rebounding str ongly in the first quarter because of the 
bounceback in motor vehicle purchases and sizable gains in spending on other goods.  
The personal saving rate, which declined furt her in recent months, stood at negative 
0.7 percent in January.  After having soared 2 percent in January, nominal spending in  the retail control category 
of goods, which excludes sales by auto dealers and building material and supply stores, 
dropped back 0.7 percent last month.  Factori ng in our translation of the February CPI 
data, we estimate that incr eases in real spending in th e PCE control category of goods 
averaged a robust 0.5 percent pace per month in  January and February on top of a large 
gain in the fourth quarter.  Real outlays fo r consumer services d eclined 0.3 percent in 
January, reflecting a plunge in expenditure s for energy services induced by unusually 
warm temperatures.  But given a return to near-normal temperatures  in February, real 
spending on consumer services is lik ely to have rebounded last month.   
 The fundamental determinants of consumer  spending remain, on balance, supportive of 
sustained increases in outlays.  Continuing im provements in the labor market have been 
generating considerable gains in wage and sa lary income, and a number of special factors 
boosted the level of disposable personal income in January.
5  Although a sharp rise in 
food and energy prices held down real dis posable personal income in January, the 
subsequent moderation in prices suggests a stronger increase in real income in February.  
Ongoing increases in home prices and gains in  the stock market have kept the ratio of 
household wealth to disposable  income at an elevated le vel.  In addition, consumer 
confidence, as measured by both the Michigan  survey and the Conference Board survey, 
remains at a level consistent with moderate increases in consumer spending.  In contrast, 
higher interest rates are likely to be exer ting some restraint on consumer spending 
growth.   
 
Housing Markets 
Housing activity has moderated somewhat from the robust pace of last summer.  
Although the level of single-family housing starts was unusually high in January and 
February, much of this strength was likely the result of the mild winter weather.  Indeed,  
                                                 
5 These special factors include the annual pay raise to federal civilian and military personnel, cost-of-
living adjustments to Social Security benefits an d other transfer programs, and the initiation of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.  Ex cluding these special factors, disposable personal income would have 
posted only a modest gain in January.

new permit issuance in this sector—adjusted for activity in areas where permits are not 
required—declined in February, continuing a downward trajector y that began in October.  
The number of permits issued in February s uggests that single-family starts will likely 
move noticeably lower in coming months .  After an unusual spike in January, 
multifamily housing starts dropped back last mo nth to a rate within  the range observed 
since 1997.    Home sales have receded in re cent months.  Sales of exis ting single-family homes fell 
1½ percent in January after having dropped 4¾ percent in December, and are nearly 
9 percent below their peak of last summer.  Sales of new homes retreated 5 percent in 
January and are down 10 percent from their recent peak.   
 Recent indicators point to some furthe r moderation in housing demand in coming 
months:  The stock of homes for sale has increased recently, and months’ supply of both 
new and existing homes are now at their highe st levels since 1998; the Mortgage Bankers 
Association’s index of mortga ge applications for home pur chases continued to decline 
through mid-March; and the Michigan Survey  index of home buying attitudes has also 
continued to trend lower.  Housing demand is likely being damped by rising mortgage 
rates, which have moved up further in recen t months.  The average rate on thirty-year 
fixed-rate mortgages now stands about 70 basi s points higher than in  the middle of last 
year, and the average rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages has risen about 
1 percentage point over that period.    House price appreciation appears to have sl owed some from the rapid pace of last 
summer, but price increases for both new a nd existing homes remain well within the 
elevated range that has prevailed in recen t years.  The purchase-only version of the 
OFHEO price index for existing homes, whic h controls for differences in quality by 
tracking repeat sales of the same houses ove r time, was 11 percent higher in the fourth

 6  This rate of increase was smaller than the four-quarter 
changes of last summer and autumn but about  the same as the fou r-quarter change in 
2004.   In January, the average price of exis ting homes sold was 9 percent higher than a 
year earlier, a slightly smaller increase than  during the comparable period twelve months 
earlier.  A deceleration in new home prices is more evident.  The constant-quality price

transactions, was 13 percent higher in the fourth quarte r than it was a year earlier.  This increase was a bit 
below the four-quarter changes post ed around the middle of last year.

sales, home size, and other readily measurab le attributes—was 5 percent higher in the 
fourth quarter than it was a year earlier, down from roughly an 8 percent gain over the 
four quarters of 2004; increases  in the average pr ice of new homes have also moderated.7 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real outlays for equipment and software (E&S ) decelerated to a 6 percent annual rate of 
growth in the fourth quarter, following an average increase of 10 percent in the first three 
quarters of 2005.  However, available data for January and February suggest appreciably 
greater strength in the current quarter.  This pattern reflects sizable swings in outlays for 
transportation equipment.  Excluding such out lays, E&S spending increased at an average 
annual rate of 9¾ percent over the second ha lf of 2005 and looks poised to post another 
sizable increase in the current quarter.  The fundamentals underlying capital spending continue to be supportive:  Business 
output has been expanding briskly, firms are flush with cash, and the user cost of capital continues to decline as the relative price of high-tech equipment remains on a steep 
downtrend.  Industry surveys also point to ongoing strength in E&S spending.     
 Business spending on transportation equipment, wh ich declined at an 11½ percent rate in 
the fourth quarter because of a sharp drop in  aircraft purchases, appears to be rebounding 
sharply this quarter.  Shipme nts of civilian aircraft m oved up in January, and Boeing 
reported that aircraft deliveries were st rong in February.  Although aircraft bookings 
retreated sharply in January from  their extraordinarily high leve ls at the end of last year, 
orders for aircraft are placed with long l ead times, and the sizable backlog of orders 
already in hand bodes well for de liveries in the near term.

 Business spending on motor vehicles has rema ined quite robust.   
 
                                                
 
7 In January 2005, the Census Bureau began phasing in a new sampling frame for new home sales, and 
the sales prices of homes in the current sample are not  comparable to those in the previous sample.  The 
sample of homes sold in 2005 contained a mixture of homes drawn from both the old and new sampling 
frames, making the year-to-year changes in the reported average price of new homes difficult to interpret.  
The twelve-month percent change in average prices shown on the chart has been adjusted by the Board’s 
staff to account for the cha nge in the sampling frame. 
8 Shipments of finished aircraft can  differ significantly from the curr ent production of aircraft, as the 
production measure reflects work in progress for delivery up to nearly one year ahead.

  Sales of medium and heavy trucks averaged an annual rate of 
530,000 units in January and February, a bit above the already-el evated pace in the 
previous quarter.  Looking ahead, both orders  and backlogs for new trucks suggest that 
dem
and will remain strong in th e near term.  Much of the re cent strength likely reflects 
purchases of heavy trucks in advance of the new regulations on engi ne emissions that are 
scheduled to take effect in 2007.      
 Real expenditures on high-tech E&S rose at a moderate annual rate of 11¾ percent in the 
fourth quarter, and monthly indicators point to  a stronger gain in the first quarter.  
Nominal shipments of communi cations equipment leapt 4½ pe rcent in January on top of 
a large increase in December, and January or ders also rose consid erably.  Thus, real 
outlays on communications equipment are lik ely to rebound significan tly this quarter, a 
move that would be consistent with expe nditure plans reported  by telecom service 
providers and anecdotes from  communications equipment producers.  Nominal shipments 
of computers and peripherals declined 4½ per cent in January after a notable increase in 
the fourth quarter, and nominal orders droppe d 11 percent.  However, because prices 
have continued to decline, real expenditure s are likely to post a moderate gain in the 
current quarter.    Real outlays for non-high-tech, nontransporta tion equipment surged late last year, 
expanding at an annual rate of 8 percent in  the fourth quarter.  In January, nominal 
shipments increased ¾ percent—the sixth straig ht month of solid gains, and orders also 
rose ¾ percent.  These monthly data suggest  this category of spending will remain strong 
in the near-term.    
Nonresidential Construction  
Although vacancy rates for nonresid ential properties have declin ed on balance in the past 
two years (especially for office buildings), real spending on new construction has yet to 
gain traction.  The vacancy rate for office buildings was about 12 percent in the first two 
months of the year, around 2 percentage points below its peak in the first quarter of 2004.  
In the retail sector (which accounts for a major portion of spending on commercial buildings), vacancy rates also remain low.  Nevertheless, real expenditures on both office and retail buildings are still sluggish, and real outlays for structures in the manufacturing 
sector have been flat for the past ye ar after increasing a bit in late 2004.  
 
In contrast to the building categories of nonr esidential investment, outlays for drilling and 
mining structures continued to rise rapidly, at an annual rate of 16½ pe rcent in the fourth

suggesting that real expenditures on drilli ng and mining structures will continue to 
increase in the near term.  
Business Inventories  
The book value of manufacturing and trade invent ories excluding motor vehicles rose at a 
moderate pace in the fourth quarter, though much of the incr ease reflected rising prices 
for goods held in this sector.  In real term s, inventories ran off in October and were 
unchanged in November as supply interrup tions following the hurricanes held down 
stockbuilding.  Indeed, ISM purchasing managers  considered customer inventory levels 
in September and October to have been t oo low.  However, real stocks rebounded in 
December, and customer inventories since then have been viewed as being in a 
comfortable range.  On a book-valu e basis, inventories in Janu ary rose at an annual rate 
of $55 billion.  However, prices appear to  have risen again, suggesting that real 
accumulation in January was subdued.  The inventory-sales ratio declined slightly in January, consistent with the downwar d long-run trend in this measure. 
 Information from the Board staff's flow-o f-goods inventory system, which measures 
inventories wherever held, suggests that—e xcluding motor vehicles and parts—days’ 
supply of inventories was flat in February  after falling for four consecutive months.  
Apart from paper products, where stocks rema in excessive, inventories appear to be well 
aligned with consumption. 
 
Federal Government  
The federal budget deficit was smaller over th e past two months than over the same 
period last year.  According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the federal government 
recorded a cumulative deficit of $98 billion in January and Februar y, compared with the 
$105 billion deficit posted for th e same months in 2005.  Over the twelve months ending 
in February, the deficit of $313 billion was lo wer than the $408 billion deficit recorded 
over the comparable period twelve months earlier.  
 Federal tax receipts have continued to rise fast er than nominal income.  Total receipts in 
January and February increased 13 percent from  year-earlier levels, with sizable gains in 
corporate and individual inco me and payroll taxes.  Moreover, data from the Daily 
Treasury Statements indicate that final co rporate tax payments due March 15 were 
$8 billion, or 29 percent, above payments made a year ago.  Individual income tax 
refunds through mid-March are less  than 4 percent greater than last year.  However, it is

still early in the tax refund season; as of mid-March, refunds have cumulated to only 
about half of the total projected for the season.  
 Federal outlays in January and February increas ed more slowly than receipts but still are 
8 percent above year-earlier le vels.  Defense spending rose 7½ percent, an increase 
consistent with a hefty first-quarter rebound in  the NIPA measure of real federal defense 
purchases.  Outlays for Social Security, whic h were about 6½ percen t higher than a year 
earlier, were boosted in part by a 4.1 percent cost-of-living ad justment for benefits this 
year; this adjustment is almost 1½ percentage  points higher than last  year and the largest 
since 1990.  Spending for Medicare soared more than 27 percent in January and 
February, largely because of the new Part D payments for prescription drugs.  The Part D 
payments that previously were covered unde r Medicaid are also contributing to the 
decrease in Medicaid outlays  compared with last year. 
 Net interest payments were 
17 percent greater than a year ago because of the higher level of fede ral debt and the rise 
in interest rates.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) pub lished its annual budget outlook, and the 
Administration submitted its budget for fiscal year 2007 to the Congress.  The Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that , if the Administration’s policy proposals 
are enacted, the unified deficit for fiscal 2006 would be $423 billion, or 3.2 percent of 
nominal GDP.  However, using the same assumptions about policy, the CBO puts the 
deficit at $371 billion, or 2.8 percent of GD P, with the difference attributable to 
economic and technical assumptions.  Th e Administration’s budget proposals would 
increase spending this year, primarily for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and would reduce taxes.  The tax reduction woul d mostly come from extending expired tax 
provisions related to relief from the alternat ive minimum tax for individuals and to the 
business tax credit for resear ch and experimentation.   
 The House passed a supplemental appropriatio ns bill that included $72 billion in funding 
for the war on terrorism and $19 billion for hurri cane disaster relief; the Senate has not 
yet voted on a supplemental bill.  These levels of supplemental appropriations are very similar to requests in the President’s budget.   The funding for the war on terrorism would 
help maintain current levels of spending for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan for 
this year.  The spending resulting from the a dditional appropriations for hurricane relief 
probably will not be noticeable un til next fiscal year and ther eafter.  In a separate action, 
the Congress recently sent legislation to the President to increase the borrowing authority 
of the federal flood insurance program by more  than $2 billion dolla rs; and because the

State and Local Government 
Real purchases by state and local governments a ppear to have gotten off to a slow start in 
the current quarter.  Expenditures for construction fell sharply in real terms in both the third and fourth quarters of 2005 after having moved up in the first half of the year.  
Construction spending decrease d 0.2 percent in nominal term s in January and is likely 
down considerably in real terms given the larg e increases lately in prices of construction-
related materials.  Employment by state a nd local governments declined in January, in 
part because many workers at educational es tablishments were still on holiday layoffs 
during the reference week for the payroll surv ey, which occurred relatively early in the 
month.  Hiring rebounded in February, but the average job gain over the two months was 
just 7,000—only about half the average pace in 2005.    Strong growth in income and in retail sales have continued to bol ster state revenues, 
which are estimated to have risen about 8 pe rcent between th e fourth quarter of 2004 and 
the fourth quarter of 2005.  With revenues holding up well, many states apparently are 
contemplating at least moderate increases in spending (especially for education) in fiscal 
2007, which will start on July 1 in all but four  states.  The governor of California has 
proposed a rise of 8½ percent in genera l-fund spending for fiscal 2007, while the 
governors of several other states have requested increases in the vicinity of 5 percent.  In 
Michigan, the governor wants to keep a tight  rein on spending to address the state’s 
ongoing budget difficulties.        
 
Prices 
The overall CPI edged up in February after a large increase in January.  Energy prices 
dropped back last month, while prices of food and core items posted modest increases.  
Given these CPI data, we estimate that overa ll PCE prices also inched up last month, 
leaving the twelve-month change in February  at 2.9 percent, a pi ckup of 0.3 percentage 
point from the increase in the preceding y ear.  Core PCE prices appear to be up 
1.8 percent in February from a year earlier, a deceleration of 0.4 pe rcentage point from 
the preceding year.   We estimate that PCE prices for energy fell 1.1 percent in February  after a jump of 
5 percent in January.  Since the January Greenbook, the spot price of West Texas 
intermediate has fallen more than 9 percent,  largely because of an increase in oil

inventories.  In addition, unseasonably mild temperatures since the latter part of 
December have significantly slowed the normal winter decline in natural gas inventories, 
helping to push down natural gas prices r oughly 17 percent since th e January Greenbook.  
Mild temperatures have also contributed to an abundance of inventor ies of heating fuel, 
which, in turn, has encouraged petroleum refi ners to adjust their output mix toward 
gasoline and away from heating oil, thereby li fting stocks of gasolin e as well.  Although 
these higher inventories pushed down gasoline prices through la te February, weekly data 
for March indicate a sharp rise in gasoline pr ices that largely refl ects the shut down of 
two refineries for unplanned maintenance.  Fina lly, prices of residential electricity, which 
rose sharply around the turn of the year as ut ilities passed along higher costs for coal and 
other fuels, moved up further in February. 
 We estimate that the PCE price index for food rose 0.1 percent in February after a jump 
of 0.5 percent in the preceding month that larg ely reflected temporary spikes in prices for 
some vegetables.  More broadly, ample domes tic supplies of crops, livestock, and poultry 
have been helping to keep consum er food price inflation in check. 
 Excluding food and energy, both the January an d February readings on consumer price 
inflation were favorable.  We estimate that  core PCE prices rose 1.8 percent over the 
twelve months ending in February, 0.4 percenta ge point less than in the preceding year.  
Core goods prices—which account for a little less than a third of the index—decelerated 
0.7 percentage point over this period, while  prices for core services decelerated 
0.3 percentage point.  Broader measures of inflation moved slightly higher last year, but their core components 
were roughly unchanged.  GDP prices exclud ing food and energy rose  2.8 percent over 
the four quarters of 2005—identi cal to the rate of increase in 2004—as a deceleration in 
core consumer prices was offset by a pic kup in nonresidential construction prices. 
 The Michigan SRC measure of median one -year inflation expectations rose, on a 
preliminary reading, to 3.2 per cent in March.  However, median  five- to ten-year inflation 
expectations in early March stayed below 3 percent for the third month in a row.  In 
comparison, inflation compensation implie d by rate spreads on CPI-indexed Treasury 
bonds was around 2½ percent for both five- and ten-year maturities, little changed from 
the inflation compensation indicated at the time of the January Greenbook.

Regarding producer prices, the PPI for capital  equipment rose 0.1 percent in February 
after an advance of 0.3 percent in January.  Despite these recent increases, prices of 
capital equipment have decelerated 1 percenta ge point over the past twelve months.   
 At earlier stages of processi ng, higher energy prices still se em to be passing through to a 
number of core intermediate materials, a lthough increases in this price measure have 
moderated from those observed in the immediat e aftermath of the hurricanes last autumn.  
Indeed, prices for energy-intensive intermedia te products such as chemicals, plastics, and 
nitrogenous fertilizers moved down, on bala nce, in January and February, after 
particularly sharp increases in the fourth quart er.  The PPI for core intermediate materials 
moved up 0.5 percent in February, less than the average monthly gains seen late last year 
but above the gains seen last summer.  Prices for core crude materials rose 3.3 pe rcent in February, br inging the twelve-month 
change in these prices to almost 12 percent, more than twice the rate of increase posted in 
the preceding year.  The Journal of Comm erce (JOC) metals inde x stands 3.7 percent 
higher than at the time of the January Greenbook.  Among the other commodity price 
indexes that exclude energy, the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) spot industrials 
index has risen 1.5 percent since the last Greenbook, while the CRB spot foodstuffs index 
has fallen 1.8 percent.  The JOC industria l index and the CRB futures index, both of 
which contain a substantial energy component , have declined 1.9 pe rcent and 1.3 percent 
respectively.  
Labor Costs 
Over the three months ending in December, the employment cost index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation of private industry workers ro se at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, 
unchanged from the preceding three-month inte rval.  On a twelve-month-change basis, 
the ECI increased just 3.0 pe rcent in 2005, 0.8 percentage point  less than the increase in 
the preceding year.  The wages and salaries component of the EC I rose 2.5 percent in 2005, about the same as 
the increase during the previous year.  In contrast, benefit costs rose 4.1 percent in 2005, 
well below the 6.9 percent increase registered  in the previous y ear.  Much of the 
slowdown in benefit costs reflects substantiall y smaller increases in firms’ contributions 
to defined-benefit pension plans, a likely consequence of the improved performance of 
equity markets in the past few years.  In  addition, although bonus payments picked up

last year, employer payments for health in surance and workers’ compensation slowed 
considerably.  In contrast to the relatively modest gain s in the ECI, compensa tion per hour in the 
nonfarm business sector is estimated to have ri sen at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the 
third quarter of last year and at a 2.8 percent pace in the four th quarter.  The third-quarter 
reading now incorporates data from state unemployment insurance tax records, which 
added almost 1½ percentage points to the initi al estimate; the fourth-quarter reading is 
based on much sparser information.  No twithstanding the upward revision to 
compensation, the markup of prices over uni t labor costs remained higher than the 
historical average for both the nonfarm busine ss sector (through the fourth quarter) and 
the nonfinancial corporate sect or (through the third quarter, th e latest quarter for which 
data are available).

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview  
Over the intermeeting period, policy expect ations firmed, on balance, against the 
backdrop of policy tightening abroad, comme nts by Federal Reserve officials, and 
incoming data pointing to solid economic growth.  Longer-term yi elds also moved up, 
and the ten-year yield approached the level prevailing before the start of the tightening 
cycle in June 2004.  Most stock price inde xes edged up, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, as gains from lower oil prices were offs et by the effects of higher interest rates.  
Robust corporate profits conti nued to support business credit  quality, and corporate bond 
spreads stayed low.  Although household mortgage borrowing remained robust in the fourth quarter of last year, measures of hous ehold credit quality continue to show few 
signs of stress.   
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Both the decision at the January FOMC meetin g to increase the target federal funds rate 
25 basis points, to 4½ percent, and the text of the accompanying statement largely accorded with market expectations and evoked only limited reaction in financial markets.  
Subsequently, policy expectations firmed, on net, as comments by Federal Reserve 
officials were interpreted as suggesting th at the end to the ti ghtening cycle was not 
imminent, and incoming data indicated robust economic growth both in the United States 
and abroad.  Investors are now virtually certai n of a quarter-point increase in the funds 
rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting and pl ace significant odds on another tightening at 
the May meeting.  Implied rates on longer-dated  Eurodollar futures contracts rose about 
20 to 25 basis points on net ove r the intermeeting period.   
 Nominal Treasury yields moved up over the in termeeting period, with the two- and ten-
year yields rising about 20 basi s points.  In addition to the upward revision to domestic 
policy expectations, less accommodative pol icy abroad seemed to boost longer-term 
Treasury yields over the period.  Amid firming policy expectat ions and falling oil prices, 
inflation compensation over the next five years, measured by Treasury inflation-protected 
securities adjusted for the effect of i ndexation-lag, declined modestly over the 
intermeeting period.  Inflation compensation for the subsequent five years was little 
changed on balance.     
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Although held back by rising interest rates, broad stock market i ndexes ended the period 
a touch higher on lower oil prices and favorable macro economic news.  Shares of 
telecom firms, which were supported by positive earnings news and merger

announcements, outperformed the market, whil e lower oil prices weighed on the share 
prices of energy firms.  The ratio of trend earnings to price for th e S&P 500, a measure of 
expected long-run real equity returns, rema ined near 5½ percent, where it has been 
hovering for the past couple of years.  Alt hough the recent increase in the long-term real 
Treasury yield narrowed the real equity premiu m a bit, the premium stayed a shade above 
its average over the past two decades.  The implied volatility on the S&P 500 remained 
near historically low levels.  Over the intermeeting period, yields on i nvestment-grade corporate bonds moved up 
roughly in line with those on comparable-mat urity Treasury securitie s, and risk spreads 
on those bonds were about unchanged.  Ri sk spreads on high-yield corporate bonds 
narrowed about 20 basis points.  The low leve l of high-yield bond sp reads likely reflects 
the sanguine view of corporat e credit quality over the next  couple of years.  In the 
commercial paper market, the thirty-day quality spread remained low.    
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
The end of the fourth-quarter earnings season brought relatively few surprises, as firms 
continued to post solid gains in profitabilit y.  With reports available from nearly all 
companies in the S&P 500, earnings per share in  the fourth quarter are estimated to have 
increased 14 percent from a year earlier.  There were few announcements of note, and 
analysts’ forecasts of yea r-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were about unchanged in 
February and early March.   Bolstered by robust earnings and strong bala nce sheets, measures of aggregate business 
credit quality continued to show few signs of st ress.  The ratio of corporate debt to assets 
is estimated to have slipped further in th e fourth quarter, and firms’ liquid assets 
maintained their recent lofty levels.  B ond rating downgrades by Moody’s increased in 
the first quarter, but downgrad es of securities issued by Ford and General Motors 
represented more than half of the total.  After spiking in December because of the 
bankruptcy of Calpine, a large power compa ny, the six-month trailing bond default rate 
flattened out, as few bonds defaulted in Janua ry and February.  Br oader measures also 
indicate business credit remain ed solid.  The delinquency rate  on C&I loans stayed low in 
the fourth quarter, and a measure of aggregat e expected defaults ove r the next year based 
on Moody’s KMV data remained at a low le vel in January and February.

Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms has sl owed in February and early March after 
outsized issuance in January, when several en ergy firms tapped the market.  Acquisition 
financing continued to account  for a significant part of total issuance.  Similarly, 
following a sizable increase in January, C& I loans outstanding expanded modestly in 
February and March, and commercial paper outst anding is expected to end the quarter at 
about where it started.  In total, net debt fi nancing by nonfinancial co rporations fell back 
from its rapid January rate to a moderate pace similar to that for 2005.         Gross public equity issuance remained near its modest pace of the past several years.  
Equity retired in cash mergers, which has been boosted by a surge in leveraged buyout 
activity, finished 2005 quite strong and has re mained high thus far in 2006.  Equity 
retired through share repurchases is estimated  to have reached a historic peak in the 
fourth quarter, and a record level of a nnounced repurchase plans suggests that share 
repurchases will continue at a very high pace th is year.  In total, hefty corporate profits 
and liquid balance sheets continued to buttr ess the significant level of net equity 
retirements.   
Commercial Real Estate  
Fueled by continued rapid price increases  for commercial real estate, commercial 
mortgage debt expanded robustly in the four th quarter and reached a level almost  
16 percent above that of a y ear earlier.  The issuance calendar for commercial-mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) suggests sustained strength in the current quarter.  Spreads of 
BBB-rated CMBS over comparable Treasuries have  declined in recent weeks to reverse a 
run-up around year-end.    Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages have remained lo w by historical standards, 
and a slip in vacancy rates and firming of rents in the current quarter reflect further 
improvement in market fundamentals.  The ratio of net operating income to property 
prices, an indicator of the yiel d on commercial real estate, d eclined further in the fourth 
quarter to a level last seen in 1990.  However, the spread of this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough measure of the risk premium on commercial real estate 
assets, remained in the middle of th e range observed over the past decade.

debt remained rapid through the end of 2005.  By contrast, consumer credit growth was 
held down in the fourth quarter by the bulge in credit card charge-offs triggered by the 
spike in bankruptcy filings last fall.  Data for January show a modest pick-up in consumer 
credit growth and a sharp decline in charge-offs .  Consistent with the view that many of 
the bankruptcy filings that pr eceded the implementation of the new rules were pulled 
forward from future months, bankruptcy filings  in recent weeks have continued to run at 
low levels.  
 The financial obligations rati o edged down in the fourth quarter but, at more than 
18½ percent of disposable income, remained near  the top of its historical range.  Even so, 
most measures of consumer loan delinque ncy rates held steady at low levels.  
Delinquency rates on mortgages increased some what, but at least some of the updrift 
appears related to last yea r’s hurricanes.  On the whole, most households met their 
obligations without sign ificant strain.    
 House prices, as measured by the repeat-tra nsactions purchase-only index from OFHEO, 
increased at an annual rate of 9½ percent in the fourth quarter .  Although still quite 
robust, the modest slowing in th e rate of appreciation is consis tent with anecdotal reports.  
Rising home prices and stock pr ices contributed to an increase in household net worth 
during the fourth quarter, but with income up strongly as well, the ratio of net worth to 
disposable income was little changed.  Net purchases of long-term mutual funds were 
very strong in January and February, and a disp roportionate share of the inflows to equity 
funds was allocated to international funds.  
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
During the intermeeting period, federal debt s ubject to the statutory limit reached the 
previous ceiling of about $8 ⅛ trillion, and the Treasury had to employ accounting 
maneuvers to avoid breaching the limit.  On  March 14, the Congress increased the federal 
debt ceiling to nearly $9 trilli on.  Given that market particip ants expected the increase in 
the limit, there was little effect on asset prices.    The Treasury conducted auctions of coupon s ecurities of various maturities over the 
intermeeting period, all of which were genera lly well received.  The first thirty-year bond 
auction since 2001 generated especially strong interest from investment funds, such as 
pension funds, perhaps because those institutions are seekin g to extend the duration of 
their portfolios.  Foreign investors were awar ded only a small fraction of the total for that 
issue.

Share prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac declined moderately over the intermeeting 
period amid statements by Treasury Departme nt officials reaffirming their support for 
significant GSE portfolio reductions and an  announcement that both agencies would 
again delay the release of their financial statements.  The GSEs’ debt spreads were about unchanged.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds has slowed t hus far in 2006 as advance 
refundings have dropped below their pace in 2005 .  The decline in refunding activity is 
consistent with a dwindling pool of eligible bonds and the increase in  interest rates from 
their 2005 lows.  The volume of short-term i ssuance was also comparatively light in the 
first part of the year, a development that likely reflects healthier budget conditions in 
many states.        The credit quality of state and local govern ments continued to impr ove, as first-quarter 
rating upgrades far exceeded downgrades on the strength of upgrades for New York State 
and Chicago.  Consistent with better credit  quality, yields on long- dated municipal bonds 
edged down, and the ratio of the municipal bond yield to a comparable-maturity Treasury 
yield declined over the intermeeting period.   
 
Money and Bank Credit 
On average over the first two months of the year, M2 growth picked up further, with 
especially strong advances in currency, sma ll time deposits, and retail money funds.  The 
acceleration in small time depos its and retail money funds was probably a response to 
further increases in offering rates.    Bank credit expanded rapidly in  February, as several large domestic commercial banks 
purchased sizable amounts of agency and privat e mortgage-backed securities.  Loans also 
continued to increase briskly in Februa ry, with the growth  reflecting both an 
accommodative lending environment and str ong demand for bank-intermediated credit.  
The growth of business loans stepped down after an outsized gain in January but 
remained quite robust.  Loan price data from  the February Survey of Terms of Business 
Lending indicate that the average spread on C&I loans at domestic commercial banks, 
adjusted for changes in non-price terms, remained low in the first quarter.  Although 
further increases in short-term market in terest rates restrained borrowing through home 
equity lines of credit, real estate loans expanded smartly on strong growth in both its 
other residential and co mmercial components.

Call Report data for the fourth quarter of 2005 indicate that the pr ofitability of the 
commercial banking sector remained strong.  Although depressed by lower net interest 
margins and a sharp decline in  trading revenues, bank profits  were buoyed last quarter by 
significant reductions in non-inte rest expense and lower loan-loss provisions.  While the 
surge in personal bankruptcy filings last fall led to a sharp increase in net charge-offs on 
credit card loans, overall asset quality remained strong.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $789.5 billion in the fourth quarter, as a 
9.2 percent (annual rate) gain in exports of goods and services was outweighed by a 
19.7 percent rise in im ports.  The rise in exports was concentrated in capital goods, 
autom otive products, and, to a lesser extent, consum er goods.  In contrast, exports of 
agricultural products and indus trial supplies m oved down in the quarter, likely depressed 
by hurricane-related disruptions to shipping and production.  The gain in imports was 
widespread across m ajor catego ries of trade.  In real term s (as reported in the prelim inary 
NIPA release), exports of goods and services ro se at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the 
fourth quarter, and im ports of goods and services surged 12.8 percent.

strong gain in December.  Within industrial supplies, exports of ch emicals and petroleum 
products exhibited strong growth, in line with a continued recovery of domestic 
production from earlier hurricane-induced w eakness.  Exports of capital goods were 
boosted by a jump in exports of aircraft and computers, which more than offset a decline 
in exports of semiconductors.  Agricultural e xports were supported by a large increase in 
exports of soybeans.  Services exports also expanded moderately. 
 
The value of imported goods and services su rged 3.5 percent in January after a strong 
gain of 1.7 percent in December.  The incr ease in imports was widespread across most 
product categories.  Imports of capital goods grew briskly, with computers and other 
capital equipment recording large gains.  Imports of consumer goods, particularly 
electronics, and automotive produc ts also surged.  Imports of non-oil industri al supplies 
moved up despite a decline in imports of chem icals.  The value of imported oil increased 
strongly, entirely as a result of higher oil pr ices.  Imports of serv ices and foods also 
strengthened a bit.  
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In February, import prices of non-oil goods fell 0.5 percent, while 
prices of imported core goods increased 0.1 pe rcent.  A 19.2 percent decline in the price 
for imported natural gas, a category that we  now exclude from core imports, was the 
main reason for the difference.  After increa sing 1.5 percent in Janua ry, prices for nonfuel 
industrial supplies rose  another 1.4 percent in Februar y, reflecting higher prices for 
metals.  Food prices fell 1.7 percent in Febr uary, partially undoing the increases of the 
previous two months.  For the second cons ecutive month, prices of imported finished 
goods were generally higher, particularly  for capital goods (exc luding computers and 
semiconductors) which rose 0.4 percent.   Prices for consumer goods were unchanged. 
 
The average level of core import prices in January and February was 2½ percent at an 
annual rate above the fourth-quarter averag e, as prices in all sub-categories posted 
increases with the exception of automotive pr oducts.  The main contributor to the overall 
price increase was nonfuel indus trial supplies, which increased 10½ percent.  Average 
prices for food also recorded a large increase, rising 6¼ percent.  Prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) rose 1¾ percent.

Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil fell 0.7 percent in February, after a 6.9 percent 
rise in January.  The average spot price of West Texas Inte rmediate (WTI) crude oil fell 
5.9 percent in February to $61.60 per barrel, as warm weather in the United States 
contributed to decreased oil de mand and rising crude oil invent ories.  The spot price of 
WTI has been volatile thus far in March in  reaction to increasing inventories, supply 
disruptions in Nigeria and Ec uador, an attack against Saudi oil infrastructure, and 
heightened concerns about future supplies from  Iran and Iraq.  The spot price closed on 
March 21 at $60.58 per barrel. 
 
Exports.   Following sizeable increases in January, in February, prices of U.S. exports of 
total goods were unchanged and prices of co re goods increased only 0.1 percent.  After 
increasing 0.7 percent in Janua ry, agricultural prices fell 1.1 percent, reflecting lower 
prices for soybeans and vegetables.  Other ca tegories of core exports saw increases in 
prices in February.  Prices  for nonagricultural industrial supplies increased 0.3 percent, 
with falling oil prices partially offsetting higher prices for meta ls.  As in January, finished 
goods generally saw sizable price increases.  Prices for both consumer goods and capital 
goods (excluding computers and semiconducto rs) rose 0.3 percent, and prices of 
automotive products edged up.  In contra st, prices of exported computers and 
semiconductors fell 0.5 and 2.2 percent, respectively. 
 
The average level of core export prices in January and February was 3¼ percent at an 
annual rate above the fourth-quarter average,  as prices increased in all sub-categories 
with the exception of agricultural products .  The 6¾ percent increase in prices for 
nonagricultural industrial supplie s was the main contributor to  the overall price increase.  
Prices of capital goods (excluding computer s and semiconductors) and consumer goods 
increased 3 percent and 2¼ percent, respectively. 
 
U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $900 billi on (a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 2005, an 
increase of $158 billion relative to the third quarter (revised).  The trade deficit widened 
$64 billion, as increases in goods and services exports were more than offset by higher 
imports.  The traditionally positive balance on investment income was negative $4 billion 
in the fourth quarter.  Net outflows from un ilateral transfers also increased by $64 billion, 
as claims on foreign insurance companies due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which had substantially reduced net outflows in the third quarter, decreased.

U.S. International Fin ancial Tran sactions 
Along with data on cu rrent accoun t transactions in the fourth quarter, BEA released d ata 
on the associated financial flows.  These da ta are summarized  in the Summ ary of U.S. 
Intern ational Transac tions table.  Net priva te finan cial inflows eased  to $155 billion after 
recording unusually large inflow s of $214 billion in the third quarter.  Official financial 
inflows were stronger than in the previous quarter, however, and total financial inflows, 
official and private, were $235 billion, only $19 billion less than  in the third quarter.  As 
the current account deficit widened in the fourth quarter, the st atistical discrepancy 
narrowed to a negative $10 billion.   
 
The fourth-quarter slowdown in private financ ial inflows owe d prim arily to U.S. direct 
investm ent abroad (line 6), which recorded an aty pical inflow for the seco nd consecutive 
quarter, reflecting ongoing effects of the pa rtial tax holiday es tablished in the 2004 
American Jo bs Creation Act (a lso known as the Hom eland Inve stment Act).  Under this 
one-f iscal-year tax holid ay, m ultinational corpo rations th at repatriate p reviously r etained 
earnings f rom foreign af filiates and r einves t them in the Unite d States are subjec t to a 
reduced effective tax rate on those earnings.  Sizeable repatriation of earnings began in 
the third quarter of 2005,  after the T reasury Departm ent issu ed a series of guidelines.  By 
our estim ate, foreign af filiates remitted near ly $7 0 billion of  previous ly retained earn ings 
in the fourth  quarter, which m ore than offs et the usual $40 billion in outflows associated 
with newly reinvested earnings and r oughly $28 billion in new equity capital and 
IV-8 
intercompany debt.  Flows of foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) 
moved down slightly in the fourth quar ter, returning to trend level.   
 
For 2005 as a whole, private inflows recorded  a rem arkable step-up from $187 billion in 
the previous year to nearly $570 billion.  Fo reign private securiti es inflows (line 4) 
surged to a new record $670 billion, more th an offsetting a pickup in the pace of U.S. 
investors’ acquisitions of forei gn securities (line 5).  Togeth er, the increase in net inflows 
through private securities and the temporary swing from out flows to inflows from net 
direct investment (U.S. investment abroad net of foreign investment in the United States) 
allowed for a weaker pace of foreign official inflows (line 1).  After registering a record 
$395 billion increase in 2004, when foreign official flows were boosted by Japanese 
intervention and associated reserves manage ment, official inflows slowed in 2005 to 
$217 billion.  The statistical discrepancy for 2005 was a relatively small positive $10 billion. 
 
Although total official inflows in 2005 were c onsiderably weaker than in 2004, inflows 
from
 China were notably higher and on net accounted for almost all of official inflows in 
the first three quarters of the year.   
 
.   
 It is often reported in the pre ss that the financial 
 transactions data may understate inflows 
from official sources because they erroneously attribute some foreign official flows to the 
foreign private sector.  It is tr ue that there is some misattribut ion in these data if official 
agencies use a foreign intermediary to acquire  U.S. assets.  To the extent possible, BEA 
corrects for this misattribution in its quarterl y balance of payments statistics using data 
from FRBNY and elsewhere, and these corrections are carried th rough to the monthly 
data shown in the table.  Nonetheless, there may be some remaining misattribution.  In 
particular, neither the monthly transactions da ta nor the FRBNY data can identify official 
acquisitions of U.S. securities that are ac quired through foreign intermediaries and held 
with foreign custodians.    
 
Turning to more recent monthly developments , foreign official flows into  the United 
States eased a bit in December but picked up smartly in January.  A swing to inflows 
from OPEC countries (line 1b) and a moderation in outfl ows by the G-10 countries and 
the ECB (line 1a) accounted for the increase in January.  On net, inflows from other 

IV-9 
countries (line 1c) were strong in both December and January, but the country 
composition of flows varied across the two mont hs.  In recent months, official flows for 
Russia, Norway, Brazil, Mexico, and Korea have been large and vol atile, with sizable 
inflows one month in many cases matched by sizable outflows the next.  These flows appear primarily to reflect active portfolio mana gement of oil earnings as well as shifts in 
the composition of reserves.  
 
.       
 
After registering a near-record monthly inflow  in Nove
 mber, foreign private purchases of 
U.S. securities eased in December and picked up only modestly in January.  For the two 
months on average, private foreigners on net sold Treasury securities (line 4a) and made 
small net purchases of agency bonds (line 4b).  Foreign private demand for corporate 
bonds (line 4c) remained strong, however, and net purchases of equities (line 4d) picked 
up sharply in January.  As is  typically the case, most of  the monthly inflows were 
recorded against the United Kingdom, providing  little information about the residence of 
the ultimate purchaser.  However, the net sales of Treasuries for December and January 
on average were more than accounted for by counterparties located in Caribbean banking 
centers, and may reflect an unwinding of positions built up earlier in the year by investment funds located in this region.   
 
U.S. residents’ acquisitions of foreign securi ties (line 5
 ) continue d at a robust pace in 
December and January, as U.S. investor appeti te for foreign equity (line 5b), primarily 
from Asia, remained strong.  A merger-related  stock swap is estimated to have further 
boosted U.S. holdings of foreign equity in Ja nuary.  Net purchases of foreign bonds were 
modest for the two months on average.  
 
Net flows through the volatile banking sector (lin e 3) swung to a sizable inflow in 
Decem
ber.  For the year as a whole, the banki ng sector recorded a moderate net inflow of 
$18 billion, well within the range of recent ex perience.  In January, the banking sector 
recorded a small net outflow.

Foreign Financial Markets  
The m ajor currenc ies in dex of the dollar m oved up 1¼ pe rcent on balance over the 
interm eeting period.  The index twice rose 2 pe rcent over its value at the beginning of the 
period, fell back both tim es, and rose again to ward the end of  the interm eeting period.  
On a bilateral basis, the dollar appreciated about 2 percent agains t the Canadian dollar 
and sterling, but is on balance little changed vis-à-vis the euro  and the yen.  Early in the 
interm eeting period, upw ard pressure on the dollar was prom pted by 
stronger-than-expected U.S. January retail sale s, and was accom panied by an increase in 
market expectations for the future path of U.S. short- term interest rates.  T he dolla r 
deprec iated in la te Febru ary and early March following statem ents by Ba nk of Japan 
Governor Fukui, which were seen as a str ong signal that the Bank of Japan would soon 
announce an end of its quantitative easi ng policy, and following press conference

the ECB’s outlook for inflation.  W eaker-tha n-expected consum er confidence, Chicago

In early March, the European Central Bank ra ised its policy ra te by 25 basis points, to 
2.5%, the B ank of Canada raised its policy ra te by 25 basis points, to 3.75%, and the 
Central Bank of Brazil cut its overnight policy interest rate 75 basis points, to 16.5%.  On 
March 9, the Bank of Japan announced the end of its policy of quant itative easing, which 
had been in place since March 2001,  and issued  a new directive stating that it would 
“encourag e the uncollateralized call rate to rem ain at effectiv ely zero percent.”  The Bank 
also issued a docum ent describing a new fra mework for the conduct of  monetary policy.  
The docum ent stated th at an “approx imate range of zero to tw o percent” in the 
year-on -year change in the headline CPI will be viewed as c onsisten t with m edium - to 
long-term  price s tability,  but Bank of Japan offici als stress ed that the release of this range 
should not be interpreted as the adoption of an  inflation targeting system .  On the day of 
the announcem ent, the dollar was little change d against the yen; yields im plied by yen 
eurocurrency futures contracts, and two- a nd five-year JGB yields  declin ed sligh tly, 
while the Nikkei index rose 2.6 percent.  On  March 16, Norway’s central bank raised its 
IV-13 
policy rate from 2.25 to 2.5 percent and the Swiss National Bank rais ed its policy rate 
from 1.0 to 1.25 percent. 
 
Ten-year government bond yields increased fr om 15 to 20 basis points in most foreign 
industrial economies, but are little changed in Canada.  Over the intermeeting period, 
headline equity indexes rose 4 to 6 percent in the euro area.  Headlin e equity indexes rose 
also in the United Kingdom and the United St ates, but were little changed in Canada. 
Japanese equity prices continued to be volatile, with the Topix index down almost 
1½ percent.  
 
The dollar depreciated 0.4 pe rcent on net against the Chinese renminbi over the 
intermeeting period, with the bulk of that change occurring after Premier Wen 
reaffirmed on March 15 his government's pledge to make the renminbi's exchange rate 
"more flexible," while ruling out the possibility of any further discrete revaluation steps.  
The dollar's cumulative depreciation agai nst the renminbi since the July 21, 2005, 
revaluation amounts to slightly less than 1 per cent.  Hence, about one  half of the total 
move in the renminbi/dollar exchange rate  since July 21 has o ccurred during this 
intermeeting period.  
 
The dollar has depreciated 2½ perc ent on net against the Brazilian real, but it has 
appreciated 3½ percent against the Mexican peso. In February, the real appreciated 
sharply against the dollar and the Brazilian EM BI+ spread over U.S. Treasuries narrowed 
to an all-time low.  Market participants attri buted these movements to the announcement 
of tax breaks for foreign investors trading gove rnment securities on the domestic market 
and the Brazilian government buying back dolla r-denominated international bonds in an

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Real GDP growth in foreign industrial economie s was mixed in the fourth quarter.  While 
economic activity slowed in the euro area and Canada, the Japanese economy expanded 
briskly and growth in the Un ited Kingdom firmed.  Monthly indicators, however, suggest 
that economic activity in foreign industrial c ountries should be robus t in the first quarter, 
thus supporting the recovery in Japan and im plying that the recent slowing in the euro 
area and Canada should be short-lived.   
 
Overall, inflationary pressures continue to be contained.  Core inflation edged down in 
the euro area in January and remained stable  in Canada.  In Japan, core consumer price 
inflation has now been slightly positive for the last three months.  Policymakers in the 
euro area and Canada reacted to these de velopments by tightening monetary policy 
somewhat, while the Bank of Japan decided to abandon its policy of “quantitative 
easing.”    
 
In Japan , real GDP rose 5.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) during the fourth quarter, reaccelerating 
after 1 percent growth in the third quarter.  Domestic demand continued to support the 
recovery:  private consumption rose at an  annual rate of 3.5 percent and gross fixed 
private investment rose 2.7 pe rcent.  Net exports contribut ed 2.4 percentage points to 
growth, as exports continued to exhibit streng th while, surprisingly, imports fell from the 
previous quarter.  
 
Monthly indicators for the first quarter are ge nerally positive.  I ndustrial production rose 
0.4 percent in January from its already hist orically high level, and the manufacturing 
purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for Februa ry remained at its record high of 57. 
Although real spending by worker’s households fell in January, retail sales posted a very 
strong 3.1 percent increase, and auto regist rations through February were 2.8 percent 
above their average level in the fourth quarter.  Housing starts rebounded in January, 
posting a 7.7 percent increase.

Overall, the labor market continues to impr ove, with employment rising 0.4 percent in 
January. Despite the rise in the unemployment rate by one-tenth to 4.5 percent in January, 
the offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of  officially posted job openings relative to the 
number of officially registered job seekers) remained at a thirteen-year high.      
 
Core consumer goods prices (which exclude fresh food but include energy) in the Tokyo 
area were flat in February, up 0.2 percent fr om a year earlier.  Core consumer goods 
prices for the country as a whole (which are released with a one-month lag) were up 
0.5 percent from a year earlier in Januar y, marking the third c onsecutive month of 
positive inflation.  Much of the improvement was due to energy prices, however, and 
consumer prices excluding both fresh food and energy were up only 0.1 percent from a 
year ago.  Twelve-month wholesale price infl ation was 2.9 percent in February.  On the 
other hand, in the fourth quarter, the GDP deflator fell 1.6 percent below its year-ago 
level, the largest decline since the second quarter of 2004. 
 
On March 9, the Bank of Japan announced that  it was ending its five-year-old policy of 
quantitative easing and that it will henceforth use the uncollateralized overnight call rate 
as its key instrument for conducting monetary policy.  Governor Fukui said that the BOJ 
will keep the overnight call rate at or close to zero for several months, as the outstanding 
balance of reserve accounts held at the central  bank is gradually drained.  Subsequently, 
rates will be raised according to economic conditions, which may imply that the policy 
rate would be kept at zero for some period th ereafter.  The Bank also stated that it would 
IV-17 
now move policy to control in flation over the medium- to long-run, which it defined as 
one to two years ahead.  It stated that most Board members had definitions of price 
stability that fell within a range of 0 to 2 pe rcent inflation in the consumer price index, 
but was careful to note that this did not define a target and that this range would be 
reviewed annually.

In the euro area , real GDP growth slowed to 1 percen t (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter 
from 2.7 percent in the previous quarter.  Private consumpti on spending declined 
0.9 percent, following strong growth in the pr evious quarter.  Net exports subtracted 
0.7 percentage points from GDP in the fourth  quarter, as export growth slowed more 
sharply than import growth.  Fixed investment  spending continued to be a relative bright 
spot, posting strong growth for the third consecutive quarter.

Recent indicators suggest, however, that eu ro-area economic activity is strengthening in 
the current quarter.  The PMI for manufacturing rose to an average of about 54 in January 
and February from 53 in the fourth quarter a nd 51 in the third quarter (where 50 is the 
threshold for positive growth).  The PMI for the services sector advanced even more 
robustly in January and February, indicating that euro-area growth is spreading beyond 
manufacturing. 
 
German GDP stagnated in the fourth quarter , even as industrial production and survey 
measures of activity showed substantial strengt h.  Indicators for th e current quarter point 
to continued strength in German industry.  German manufacturing output posted a strong 
gain in January.  The volume of German indus trial orders rose 1.4 percent in January, 
boosted by foreign orders, and the December figure was revised up sharply.  Germany's 
IFO business climate index rose in February to its highest level since 1991.   
 
There are some signs that consumer spe nding is rebounding in the current quarter.  
German retail sales, including automobiles,  rose 1.3 percent in January, and German 
consumer confidence in January reached its highest level in three years and remained near that level in February.  Euro-area reta il sales rose 0.8 percent in January, and French 
IV-19 
consumption of manufactured products rose by a similar amount.  Euro-area consumer 
confidence moved up further in February, with households’ perceptions of employment 
prospects particularly improve d relative to a year ago.  
 
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer  price inflation edged down to 2.3 percent 
in February, from 2.4 percent in Januar y.  Core inflation, excluding energy and 
unprocessed food, has been very well-behave d, edging down to 1.3 percent on a twelve-
month basis in January.  Nonetheless, on Ma rch 2, the ECB’s Governing Council raised 
its main refinancing rate 25 basis points to 2.5 percent, as expected.  In the post-meeting 
statement, President Trichet emphasized the upside risks to price stability from the 
indirect effects of past oil price rises, planned increases in administered prices and 
indirect taxes, and, in the medium to l onger term, from “strong monetary and credit 
growth in an environment of ample liquidity .”  Analysts interpreted the relatively 
hawkish post-meeting statement and an upwar d revision to the ECB staff’s inflation 
forecast as implying that further rate hikes are likely this year, though not at the next 
meeting.

Indicators for the first quarte r point to a continued recovery.  The PMI for manufacturing 
remains solidly above the 50 threshold, and th e PMI for services has increased sharply 
since the beginning of the year, reaching 59 in February.   
 
The housing sector is also continuing its rec overy.  House price increases over the past 
year were between 4 and 7 percent dependi ng on the index consulted.  New construction 
orders for housing rose 22 percent over the twelve months ending in January.  Mortgage 
lending in January (£9.1 billion)  is approaching  the previ ous high of £10 billion achieved 
in late 2003.   
 
The twelve-month change in consumer prices rose from 1.9 percent in January to 
2.1 percent in February, slightly above the Ba nk of England’s target.  Consumer prices, 
excluding energy, also rose slightly to 1.4 per cent, still well below the high of 1.8 percent 
reached in the summer of 2005.  The members of the monetary policy committee voted 
8 to 1 to keep policy rates unchanged at their March meeting.

In Canada, real GDP grew 2.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in  the fourth quarter, somewhat slower 
than in the third quarter.  Final domestic de mand continued to be robust, but a growing 
share of this demand was satisfie d through imports, which rose over 11.4 percent, 
keeping GDP growth in check.  Imports of machinery and equipment by businesses 
continued their year-long strength, as business invest ment overall contributed 
1.9 percentage points to growt h.  Private consumption, despite a sizable drop in spending 
on automobiles, accelerated a bit from the third quarter, contributing 1.7  percentage 
points to growth.  Although exports reached thei r fastest growth rate in six quarters, net 
exports subtracted 0.7  percentage points from overall GDP growth. 
 
Indicators suggest solid growth continued in  the first quarter.  Housing starts were 
surprisingly strong in both January and Fe bruary, higher than their levels in the 
comparable periods of both 2004 and 2005, wh ich were the two strongest years for 
housing starts in the past 18 years.  Manufacturer s' level of new orders remained stable in 
January, following a surge in December.  Manufacturing shipments, however, which 
have been quite volatile over the past year, fell in January, a lthough the decline was 
IV-22 
concentrated in the automotive and a few ot her sectors.  The PMI advanced in both 
January and February.  Retail sales posted an other solid increase in January, as all but 
one retail sector advanced.  The composite inde x of leading indicators continued to rise in 
January and February.

Total employment continued to grow in  January and Februa ry, maintaining its 
momentum of the fourth quarter.  The une mployment rate dipped to 6.4 percent in 
February, matching a 30-year-l ow set in November.    
 
In February, the twelve-month rate of cons umer price inflation was 2.2 percent, down 
from 2.8 percent in January as gasoline prices  retraced much of their January climb.  The 
twelve-month rate of core inflation, which ex cludes the eight most volatile components, 
was unchanged in February at 1.7 percent.  
 
On March 7, the Bank of Canada increased th e targeted overnight rate 25 basis points to 
3.75 percent, following 25-basis-point increases at each of its previous four meetings.  
This move was widely expected.  In langua ge virtually unchanged from the statement 
accompanying its previous policy decision in January, it said that “…some modest 
further increase in the policy interest rate may be required to keep aggregate supply and 
demand in balance and inflation on target over the medium term.”

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent indicators of economic activity across the developing economies have been 
generally very positive.  Four th-quarter real GDP expanded at  a strong pace in Asia, with 
China, Singapore, and the Philippines expanding  at double-digit rates.  In Latin America, 
however, activity moderated from the strong th ird-quarter pace due to a contraction in 
Mexico’s agricultural sector.  Inflation in the developing wo rld has edged up of late, but 
generally remained contained. 
 
Indicators from China  point to a moderation in activity from its recent torrid pace.  Both 
exports and investment, the engines of last year's growth, have  decelerated in the first two 
months of this year.  In early March, the authorities made several announcements aimed 
at further slowing investment growth.  Investment in some sectors will be restricted, and 
government spending on infrastructure will be reduced considerably from last year's 
level.  Real growth in retail sales also slow ed in the early months of this year, but the 
government just announced plans aimed at stim ulating rural consump tion growth.  Taxes 
on the agricultural sector have been reduced or  eliminated and agricultural subsidies have 
been raised.  In addition, the government plans to provide free e ducation to all rural 
children and health insurance for the rural poor.  Consumer pri ce inflation dipped to 
1 percent on a twelve-month ba sis in February, as food pri ces fell after the Lunar New 
Year holiday in January.  Since the last Greenbook, the rate of appreciation of the 
renminbi against the dolla r has picked up slightly.

In Hong Kong,  activity in the fourth quarter slowed from the very rapid growth seen

In Taiwan , fourth-quarter growth was almost 8 percent (s.a.a.r.), largely reflecting 
booming exports and a modest contribution from private consumption.  In January, 
industrial production fell from the previous m onth, reflecting in part the Lunar New Year 
holiday season.  However, new export orders for electronics continued to rise.  In 
February, export growth outpaced import grow th, contributing to a rebound in the trade 
balance from a weak January level.  Consumer price inflation has in ched down in recent 
months, reaching 1 percent in February on a twelve-month basis, partly owing to falling 
food prices.

In late February, President Chen Shui-bia n abolished the National Unification Council 
that was established in 1990 to promote unification with mainland China.  The Council 
had stopped operating since the beginning of  Chen’s administration in 2000.  The 
decision is expected to further strain the country’s relations with the mainland.

Economic conditions in Korea  remain strong in the first quarter.  Industrial production 
rebounded sharply in January, driven by export-or iented sectors, and indicators of retail 
sales and consumer and business confidence have remained elevated so far in the first 
quarter.  Korea’s trade surplus fell sharply in January as exports declined but evidence 
points to a recovery in February.  Consumer  prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months 
ended February, held down by declining food prices.  The Bank of Korea raised its target 
rate 25 basis points to 4 percen t in February, citing latent in flationary pressures from the 
economic recovery and persistently high oil prices, but left rates unchanged in March.

Data from the ASEAN  countries indicate that economic activity continued to expand at a 
strong pace, but performance va ried across the region.  Fourth -quarter real GDP rose  
12.5 percent in Singapore, and 11 percent in the Philippines where consumption 
accelerated ahead of the VAT increase implem ented in early February.  In Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Thailand, however, growth moderated from the strong third-quarter pace.  
The adverse effect of higher oil prices a nd higher domestic inte rest rates weighed on 
activity in Indonesia and Thailand.  More recently, January industrial production was 
down in Singapore and in Thailand.  Nevertheless, other data and anecdotes from the 
region point to a continued rec overy in global demand for elect ronics products and to an 
expansion of the external sector going forward. 
 
Consumer price inflation remained elevated in much of the regi on, reflecting higher food 
prices in some countries as well as the eff ect of higher energy prices.  The increase in 
energy costs was partly the result of cuts in fuel subsidies, most notably in Indonesia.  
Citing inflationary pressures, official intere st rates were increase d by 25 basis points in 
Malaysia on February 22 and in Thailand in early March. 
 
In recent weeks, the political situation has de teriorated in the Philippines and in Thailand.  
President Arroyo declared a state of emergency in the Philippines on February 24 following rumors of a coup.  The state of emer gency was lifted a week later as the threats 
appeared to have subsided.  In Thailand, th e Prime Minister dissolved parliament last 
month and announced a snap election for April 2 amid calls for his resignation in protests

Performance of the Indian  economy has been strong.  Output rose 8.4 percent in the 
fourth quarter, with sizable gain s in the construction and servi ces sectors.  More recently, 
the government announced that it was expecting double-digit growth in the first quarter.  
After narrowing a bit around the tu rn of the year, India's trade deficit widened sharply in 
February as exports fell and non-oil imports surged.  The cl osely watched wholesale price 
index rose 4.2 percent over the 12 months e nded February—down slight ly from late last 
year.  Last month the government released  its budget plan for fiscal year 2006/2007, 
which begins in April.  The budget includes hefty spending increases on infrastructure, 
education, and health, but presumes that strong growth will boost revenues, allowing for 
a slight narrowing of the defic it to 3.8 percent of GDP.

In Mexico , real GDP growth moderated to 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, somewhat 
below expectations, but recent i ndicators point to expansion in activity going forward.  A 
marked decline in the volatile agricultural sector, reflecting the impact of last year's 
hurricane season, weighed heavily on fourth- quarter activity.  On the other hand, output 
in the services sector grew solidly during th e fourth quarter, and i ndustrial activity, which 
had been soft during most of 2005, grew a bout 2.2 percent on the back of an ongoing 
gradual pickup of U.S. demand for Mexican ma nufactures.  In particular, auto production 
and exports have soared recently  after months of weakness in U.S. demand.  The surge in 
auto exports contributed to a solid perfor mance in production in January and to a 
noticeable improvement in Mexico’s trade balance.

Consumer price inflation edged up in recent mo nths due mostly to higher food prices, but 
remained within the Bank of Mexico’s 2- to-4 percent target range.  Twelve-month 
headline inflation was 3.8 per cent in February, while core inflation (not shown) was 
2.9 percent.  The benign infla tion prospects led the Bank of Mexico (BOM) to continue 
easing policy in February for a seventh consecutive time since August.  As a result, the 
rate on 28-day peso-denominated bills, a wi dely used measure of the monetary policy 
stance, has fallen from 9.6 percent in August to  7.3 percent in mid-Ma rch.  However, the 
IV-34 
BOM indicated in recent announcements that it now has "limited" room to continue 
easing policy. 
 
In Brazil , real GDP rebounded 3.4 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter after a contraction 
in the third quarter, bringing the total output growth for 2005 to 1.5 percent.  While the 
rebound was largely anticipated, it was not as strong as markets had expected due to lingering weaknesses in the agri cultural and services sector s.  More recently, January 
industrial production fell slightly.  Monthly headline inflation declined in February, reflecting the waning effects of increases in  food and fuel ethanol  prices in January, 
bringing twelve-month inflation down to 5.5 percent.  On March 8, the central bank reduced the policy rate 75 basis points to 16.5 pe rcent as was expected.  The policy rate is 
down 325 basis points since the current polic y easing cycle began last September. 
 
Over the month of February, the Brazilian government announced that it would retire 
$20 billion in external debt by th e end of the year.  As part of  that plan, it will exercise a 
call option on $6.6 billion in Brady bond debt in  mid-April, hence re tiring the remaining 
Brady bond debt.  Additionally, the governme nt eliminated some taxes on foreign 
investment in real -denominated government debt sold domestically.  Citing improving 
external indicators and the re duction in exposure to currency risks, S&P raised Brazil’s 
credit risk rating one notch to BB in late February.  Partly re flecting these recent 
developments, the Brazil EMBI+ spread has narrowed considerab ly over the inter-
meeting period.

In Argentina , fourth quarter output rose almost 9 percent (s.a.a.r.), reflecting strong 
growth in private consumption and investme nt.  For 2005, the real investment to GDP 
ratio reached almost 20 percent, the hi ghest since 1998.  More recently, industrial 
production fell in January, reflecting the shutdow n of automobile plants for retooling, 
which typically happens in slightly different months each year.  Consumer price inflation 
edged down to 11.4 percent in February on a twelve-month basis, still above the central bank’s 2006 inflation projection of 8-to-11 percent.   
 
 In early March, the government of Argentina announced a ban on beef exports for at least 
180 days after failing to convince beef produ cers and distributors to voluntarily freeze 
beef prices.  According to the govern
ment, th e measure was necessary to prevent surging 
international demand from pushing local b eef prices beyond the purchasing power of 
Argentine families.  Even though beef accounts for only 4.5 percent of the consumption basket, it contributed almost 1 percentage point to last year's 12 percent inflation rate. 
The new policy is not expected to materially affect inflation going forward.

In Vene zuela , reliable data on activity are scarce, but anecdotal evidence suggests that 
economic activity continued to be strong in the first quarter, suppor ted by the high price 
of oil and by very expansionary fiscal and m onetary policies.  February auto sales were 
up 40 percent from a year earlier.  Inflati on continued to decline and was 12.5 percent on 
a twelve-month basis in Februa ry due mostly to price controls on food.  In late February, 
the Venezuelan government announced that it would buy back up to $4 billion in Brady 

IV-36 
bond external debt in an effort to reduce th e country’s external de bt, following a similar 
announcement by the Brazilian government.  On February 10, S&P upgraded 
Venezuela’s credit rating on long-term forei gn currency denominated sovereign debt to 
BB-, citing the country’s improving external pos ition as a result of high international oil 
prices.
