Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Economic activity expanded strongly in the first quarter, and gains were widespread 
across most categories of final sales.  C onsumer spending posted a sizable increase, 
driven by January’s bounceback in motor vehicle purchases and an acceleration in 
spending on other goods at the turn of the y ear.  In addition, favorable weather boosted 
housing construction early in the quarter.  Sin ce then, the pace of consumer spending has 
moderated, and housing starts have retraced their earlier run-up.  Business investment 
spending strengthened in the first quarter, in part because of a surg e in the purchases of 
transportation and high-tech equipment and a step-up in nonresidential construction.  The 
March employment report showed con tinuing robust employment gains, and 
manufacturing production also posted solid gain s in the first quarter.  Overall consumer 
price inflation jumped in March because of hi gher energy prices, while core prices rose a 
bit more rapidly than in earlier months.   
Labor Market Developments   
Employment continued to expand briskly in March.  Private nonfar m payrolls increased 
187,000, close to the gains in the preceding two months.  The av erage workweek of 
production or nonsupervisory workers held st eady at 33.8 hours.  Aggregate production-
worker hours rose 0.2 percent in March and incr eased at an annual ra te of 3.0 percent for 
the first quarter as a whole.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 
in March to 4.7 percent, the same level as in  January.  The labor force participation rate 
was unchanged at 66.1 percent.    Other labor market indicators are consistent  with continued strong employment gains.  
The number of persons working part-time fo r economic reasons as a share of household 
employment has dropped sharply in recent m onths, while the number of job losers 
unemployed less than five weeks as a percent of household employment has remained relatively low.  In addition, initial claims for unemploym ent insurance continued to 
fluctuate around a low level in April, and the level of insure d unemployment continued to 
trend down.   Long-term unemployment also appears to have declined.  The percen t of the labor force 
unemployed more than 26 weeks ticked down in March, while the exhaustion rate—the 
proportion of workers leaving the unemployment  insurance rolls after using their entire 
period of eligibility—moved down sharply from el evated levels at the start of the year. 
 Nonetheless, recent changes in business and household perceptions of current and future labor market conditions have been mixed.  The percentage of firms reporting to the

National Federation of Independent Businesse s (NFIB) that they had a hard-to-fill 
position fell a bit in March, and hiring pl ans of NFIB members ticked down again.  
Manpower’s index of net hiring plans edged up in March, although it remains within the 
narrow band held since the second half of 2004.  In contrast, households’ assessments of 
job availability edged up further in April to it s highest level in the past five years.  The 
Conference Board measure of expected labor market conditions ro se in April but has 
moved little on balance in recent months, while  expectations of la bor market conditions 
in the Michigan survey were unchanged in April.  The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of about 3 percent in the first quarter after a decrease of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
1  
Over the four quarters ending last quarter, output per hour  increased 2¼ percent by our 
estimate—¾ percentage point below the p ace recorded during the preceding four 
quarters. 
 
Industrial Production 
Industrial activity expanded ½ percent pe r month in February and March, and the 
available indicators suggest that IP will post an other strong gain in April.  Utilities output 
surged in February and edged up in March, but  these increases only partly reversed the 
weather-related plunge in Ja nuary.  Mining output, which includes oil and natural gas 
extraction, edged up a cumulative 0.3 percent in February a nd March as the contribution 
from hurricane-related recoveries diminished.  Excluding these sectors, industrial activity 
slowed recently from its rapid pace in the f ourth quarter.  Still, monthly increases in 
manufacturing averaged about 0.4 percent pe r month during the first quarter—down from 
the average pace of 1 percent per month in the previous quarter—but somewhat above the 
pace for 2005 as a whole.  These increases in  factory output lifted manufacturing capacity 
utilization in March to  80.4 percent, 0.6 per centage point above its  1972-2005 average.   
 Despite earlier progress, the production of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum 
products has yet to completely recover from the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  
As of May 3, domestic crude production and na tural gas extraction were about 94 percent 
and 97 percent of their pre-Katrina levels, respectively, and in both cases, complete

recoveries are not expected until the sec ond half of 2006.2  Refining activity is still being 
held down by the effects of the hurricanes, although all the damaged refineries should be 
back to full production by the end of June.3  Overall, the retu rn to production of 
hurricane-idled facilities in the energy s ector and elsewhere had little effect on total 
industrial production in Februa ry and March after having boosted IP an average of 
½ percentage point per month fr om November to January.   
 Besides the delays in restar ting damaged refineries, some refineries are shut down for 
routine maintenance that was postponed in th e immediate aftermath of the hurricanes.  
These additional shutdowns contributed to  a second consecutive monthly decline in 
refinery output in March, and weekly data suggest output will decline further in April.
4  
However, most operations are expected to re turn to normal by the start of the summer 
driving season.  Weekly physical product data  suggest that utilities output and crude oil 
extraction rose moderately in April.    Motor vehicle production rose about 200,000 units to an annual rate of 11.7 million units 
in March, and the latest schedules suggest that assemblies likel y rose further in April.  
Given April’s sales pace, the scheduled producti on rate implies that the days’ supply of 
light vehicles moved higher in April from the s lightly elevated level of 71 days in March.  
Total assemblies during the second quarter as a whole are also currently scheduled at a 
moderate pace of 11.6 million units as manufacturers seek  to keep inventories under 
control.   Elsewhere in transportation, pr oduction of commercial aircraft dropped about 2 percent in 
March after several months of  rapid gains.   
.
5  The output of military aircraft declined  
                                                 
2 The Gulf Coast region accounts for nearly 30 percen t of U.S. crude oil extraction, about 20 percent of 
natural gas extraction, and just under half of refining capacity.  After Hurricane Rita, all Gulf Coast crude 
oil extraction and about 80 percent of Gulf Coast natu ral gas extraction were shut in, as well as similar 
shares of onshore and near offshore (that is, within three miles of the coast) production in Louisiana. 
3 Three Gulf Coast refineries, representing about 4½ percent of domestic capacity, are still not fully 
operational. 
4 The effect on seasonally adjusted output is magnified by the timing of this maintenance; normally 
refineries begin ramping up gasoline production in late March. In addition, the shift by producers of blended gasoline to ethanol-based production has reduced the efficiency of refining operations. 
5 Current monthly production differs from the delivery of finished aircraft, as the production measure 
includes work in progress on planes for delivery up to ten months ahead.

slightly in the first quarter , and production will likely continue to fall in the coming 
months because deliveries to the U.S. armed forces are slated to drop in 2006. 
 The rate of growth in high-t ech output slowed sh arply in the first quarter.  Semiconductor 
production increased only at an annual rate of 11½ percent, down from a 28 percent pace 
in the fourth quarter.  Inte l’s struggle with declining market share has slowed the 
domestic output of microprocessor units (MPUs), and the company’s revenue guidance 
for the second quarter suggest s a continuation of double-dig it declines in seasonally 
adjusted revenue.
6  In addition, Intel’s inventories have  risen to record levels, and efforts 
to work off unwanted stocks will depress production even further.  However, a broader inventory problem for semiconductors does not  appear to be developing; major U.S. 
manufacturers besides Intel have kept  supplies in line with easing sales.
7  Production of 
non-MPU chips also leveled off in the fi rst quarter.  Nonetheless, orders for 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment poi nt to expansion in the semiconductor 
industry.  Downstream from semiconductors, the recen t news on high-tech production has been 
mixed.  The production of computers softened in the first quarter, as sales of PCs and 
servers to the U.S. market moved sideways; a temporary pause had been anticipated in 
advance of new product releases expected late r this year.  In c ontrast, the output of 
communications equipment continued to gr ow smartly.  Major telecommunications 
service providers plan a more moderate e xpansion in capital e xpenditures in 2006 after 
rapid increases in 2005, but firs t-quarter reports show no si gns of such a slowdown as 
yet.
8  The most recent CIO Magazine diffusion index of future spending, which reflects 
the plans of a broad array of businesses,  points to increases in the production of 
computers and of communications equipment in coming quarters.  Manufacturing production excluding energy, transportation, and high-tech products 
picked up in March after a soft January and February.  The production of consumer 
goods, business equipment, and construc tion supplies rebounded  in March after 
temporary factors, such as the effect of  EPA regulations on output of unitary air 
conditioners, held down production earlier in th e year.  In contrast, the production of  
                                                
 
6 Other things being equal, a loss in Intel market  share implies lower U.S. production because AMD, 
Intel's primary competitor, prod uces its MPUs in Germany. 
7 However, an industry contact did point out some pockets of excess inventories of motherboards and 
laptops. 
8 Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint (including recent and pending acquisitions) anticipate a 4 percent 
increase in capital expenditures in 2006  after a 17 percent increase in 2005.

II-13 
business supplies and materials slowed in February and March after rapid gains in 
preceding months.  Weekly physical product da ta outside of energy and motor vehicles 
have edged up so far in April, a rise led by increases in the production of appliances. 
 
Recent indicators of near-term manufacturing activity have been positive.  Although the 
Institute for Supply Management’s diffusion inde x for new orders ticked down in April, it 
remained at a level that suggests steady gain s in output in the coming months.  Likewise, 
the April readings on new orders from the New York and Philadelphia Fed surveys are 
down a bit from their March readings but are al so consistent with continued increases in 
manufacturing production.  The three-month moving average of the staff’s measure of 
real adjusted durable goods or ders rose 1.2 percent in March, consistent with moderate 
production increases in the near term.    
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of light vehicles were at an annual ra te of 16.7 million units in April, a bit above the 
level in March.  All of the incr ease last month was in sales of automobiles.  In particular, 
manufacturers reported higher sales of smaller au tos.  In contrast, sales of light trucks fell 
to the lowest level of the year.  The average pa ce of light vehicle sales thus far this year is 
well above the rate recorded in the fourth quart er but about even with the average pace in 
2005.  
.   
 
The Michigan Survey Research Center’s i ndex of car-buying att itudes edged down in 
April.  Although the percentage of responde nts reporting that it was a bad time to buy a 
car because of gas prices increased last month, it remained well below the high levels 
reported in the past summer.  Average incentives appear to have flattened out in April after having edged down over the past seve ral months.  Industr y analysts expect 
automakers to boost incentives in coming mont hs in order to clear out inventories of 2006 
models.    
Consumer Spending 
Growth of consumer spending appears to be moderating after posting sizable gains 
around the turn of the year.  Excluding motor vehicles, real  outlays rose a moderate 
0.2 percent in March.  Spending on services continued to rise, while spending on goods 
excluding motor vehicles posted a second-straig ht monthly decline after very robust gains 
over the previous four months.  The weekly chain store sales data point to increased 
spending in this category in April.

II-16 
The fundamental determinants of consumer spending have been ge nerally supportive of 
solid spending growth last quarter, though they  have turned less positive recently.  In 
particular, although continuing improvements in  the labor market have been generating 
considerable gains in nominal wage and sala ry income, rising gasoline prices held down 
the rise in real disposable pe rsonal income in March and are expected to damp the change 
in real DPI in April as well.  In addition, hi gher interest rates will li kely restrain spending 
in the near term.  In contrast, ongoing increase s in home prices and additional gains in the 
stock market likely further boosted the ratio of household wealth to disposable income 
last quarter.  Moreover, consumer confiden ce, as measured by both the Michigan survey 
and the Conference Board survey, remains c onsistent with moderate increases in 
consumer spending.  The personal saving rate fell to negative 0.8 percent in March, continuing its steady 
decline since last October.
9  However, all else being equal, we expect the published 
saving rate to be boosted ¾ per centage point by this year’s annual retail sales revision.  
This revision does not imply a different contour  of the saving rate over the past several 
months, though it does suggest a somewhat flat ter path of the saving rate in recent 
years.10 
 
Housing Markets 
The underlying pace of residential construction has moderated in recent months.  Single-
family housing starts fell in March to an  annual rate of 1.59 million units—the lowest 
level in a year.  Part of this  decline represents a payback fo r starts that had been pulled 
forward into January and February by unusua lly favorable weather conditions.  However, 
the adjusted level of new permit issuance in  this sector—which ticked down again in 
March— suggests that single-family starts will remain close to the March level in the coming months.  In the multifamily sector, st arts bounced back to an annual rate of 
370,000 units in March, somewhat above  their average level since 1995. 
                                                
 
9 As published, the personal saving rate was negative 0.3 percent in March.  However, that figure 
reflected an overstatement of transfer payments asso ciated with the new Medicar e Part D prescription drug 
plan.  Because April 1 was a Saturday, the April pa yment occurred on March 31.  The BEA mistakenly 
included that additional payment of $41 billion in its Ma rch estimate.  It is planning to issue a correction 
this week.  
10 The past two years’ annual retail sales revisions together imply that the March saving rate is 
1¼ percentage points higher than what is currently  reported by the BEA.  This summer, the BEA will 
incorporate the revisions to PCE control from this y ear’s annual retail sales revision, which, as noted, 
should raise the published saving rate by about ¾ percentage point.  BEA will not incorporate the 
remaining ½ percentage point upward revision to the sa ving rate, which will affect the saving rate prior to 
2003, until the next comprehensive revision in 2008.

Home sales have also declined, on net, in  recent months.  Although sales of existing 
single-family homes edged up in February a nd March, the level of sales for the first 
quarter as a whole was 4¾ percent below the record high in the second quarter of 2005.  
Sales of new homes also moved up in March, but  their average level in the first quarter 
was down about 11 percent from the peak in the third quarter of last year.   
 Other indicators also support the view that  housing markets have softened in recent 
months.  Measures of months’ supply of bot h new and existing homes have continued to 
trend higher, and the index of pending home sa les—an indicator of existing home sales in 
the near term—in March stood 9½ percent below its level last  August.  In April, the 
Michigan index of homebuying attitudes was also  well below its level of last summer.  
Housing demand should also be held down by hi gher mortgage rates.  Since the peak of 
home sales in June 2005, the average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages has risen 
about 1 percentage point, while the average rate for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages 
has risen nearly 1½ percentage points.  House price appreciation appears to have sl owed from the elevated rates seen over the 
past summer.  The average sales price of existing homes in March was 5 percent above 
its year-earlier level, a shar p deceleration from the 8 to 10 percent increases seen in 
recent years.
11  The constant quality price index for new homes—which controls for 
changes in the geographic composition of sale s, home size, and other readily measured 
attributes—was 6 percent higher in the first qua rter than it was in the same period last 
year, its smallest year-over-year increase in two years.  The average price of new homes 
declined in March relative to  last year, but caution should be exercised when interpreting 
this drop because new sampling procedures  implemented in 2005 have reduced the 
comparability of these prices to earlier periods. 
 
Equipment and Software   
Real outlays for equipment and software (E&S) surged at an annual rate of 17 percent in 
the first quarter after having ri sen at a relatively subdued annua l rate of 5 percent in the 
final quarter of 2005.  This pattern largel y reflects sharp swings in spending on 
transportation equipment.  Excluding transp ortation, E&S spending increased at an  
 
                                                 
11 The purchase-only version of the OFHEO price index for existing homes, which controls for 
differences in quality by tracking rep eat sales of the same houses over time, increased 11 percent over the 
four quarters ending in 2005:Q4.  The OFHEO price index for the first quarter will not be published until 
June.

annual rate of 12¾ percent in the first quarter, after an 8½ percent gain in the fourth 
quarter.   
 Business outlays for transporta tion equipment jumped at an annual rate of more than 
40 percent in the first quarter of this year.  Expenditures on domestic aircraft moved up 
sharply from the fourth quarter’s low valu e,  
  Business purchases of 
motor vehicles also surged in the first quart er.   
.  In addition, the pace of medi um and heavy truck sales moved up from the 
already rapid pace of the previous quarter.  According to industry analysts, much of the 
recent strength in medium and heavy truck purchases reflects a pull-forward in advance 
of the 2007 EPA regulations on engines.  March’s record-high orde rs for medium and 
heavy trucks suggest that demand will remain strong in the near term.   
 Real spending on high-tech equipment and soft ware increased at an  annual rate of 
18 percent in the first quarter, the result of  exceptionally strong growth in outlays for 
communications equipment but fairly soft spending on computers and peripherals and 
software.  Nominal orders and shipments of computers increased in  both February and 
March; these gains reversed part of the January declines, and s uggest that computer 
investment is on a somewhat stronger trajec tory going into the sec ond quarter.  In the 
communications sector, orders and shipment s declined in March after having risen 
sharply earlier in the year.  Business spending on equipment other than high tech and transportation increased 
8¼ percent in the first quarter, continuing the strong growth in this category that began in 
the middle of last year.  In March, orders  and shipments turned up, reversing their 
February declines.  These data suggest that spending in this category of equipment will rise further in the near term.  Looking ahead, the underlying fundamentals c ontinue to be suppor tive of increased 
business investment.  Growth of output and fi nal sales remains brisk, firms’ coffers are 
flush with cash, the user cost of capital conti nues to decline as the re lative prices of both 
high-tech and non-high-tech equipment maintain their downward trends, and business surveys indicate ongoing expansions  of capital spending plans.

Nonresidential Construction  
Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector have improved noticeably of late.  
Although the level of spending on nonresidential building co nstruction remains well short 
of the robust levels seen in late 2000, first-qua rter spending growth in this sector was at 
its fastest pace in nearly six years.  The ri se in construction was broad-based; among the 
major categories, only the commercial sector did not pick up.  This sector has not shown 
any significant signs of improvement even t hough vacancy rates remain low by historical 
standards.    Outlays on drilling and mining structures have continued to climb, growing at an annual 
rate of 9½ percent in the first quarter.  The numbers of rigs drilling for natural gas and 
petroleum have moved up further in recen t months, pointing to a further rise in 
expenditures in this sector  in the current quarter. 
 
Business Inventories  
We estimate that real nonfarm inventories in creased $29 billion in the first quarter, down 
from a real increase in stocks of $43 bill ion in the fourth quarter of last year.
12  The step-
down in inventory investment reflects a d ecline in investment in motor vehicle 
inventories, which had accumulated rapidly in the fourth quarter.  We estimate that real 
nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles increased about $34 billion in the first 
quarter, well above the pace in the fourth quarter.  Over the past twelve months, 
inventories relative to ship ments and sales have moved down moderately on average, 
continuing their long-run downward trend.     Information from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system sugge sts that—excluding 
motor vehicles and parts—inve ntory-consumption ratios fell in March after having edged 
up in January and February.  Outside of pa per products and semiconductors, where stocks 
remain excessive, inventories appear to rema in well aligned with consumption.  Business 
surveys suggest that firms view their customer s’ inventory levels to be in a comfortable 
range.  
                                                
 
12 This estimate is $3 billion higher than the BE A advance estimate because it incorporates March 
manufacturing inventories which were unava ilable at the time of the BEA release.

Federal Government  
The federal budget deficit, adjusted for paymen t timing shifts and financial transactions, 
showed continued improvement in March.13  According to the Monthly Treasury 
Statement, the federal government recorded  a deficit of $59 billion, about $11 billion 
lower than the deficit posted a year earlier.  Over the twelve months ending in March, the 
adjusted deficit was almost $100 billion lo wer than the deficit recorded over the 
comparable period a year earlier.  Much of this improvement resulted from st rong inflows of tax receipts, which were 
almost 17 percent higher this March than la st. Withheld individual income and social 
insurance tax receipts were a bout 9 percent higher , while corporate income tax payments, 
primarily final payments on last year’s cor porate tax liability, were  27 percent above the 
year-earlier level.  Da ily Treasury Statements show conti nued robust increase s in taxes in 
April and May:  Final payments on individua l tax liability for 2005 have come in about 
30 percent above those of last year and the fi rst quarterly corporate payments on expected 
tax liability for 2006 were a bout 25 percent higher than those of last year.   
 Federal outlays in March incr eased more slowly than recei pts but still were 6 percent 
above last year’s level.  Defense spending in March was almost 11 percent higher than 
the year-earlier level.  Ma rch outlays for the new Medica re Part D prescription drug 
program were about $3 billion, approximately  the same amount as in February.  
Anecdotal reports suggest that  Medicare outlays may pick up  a bit in coming months as 
enrollment rises in response to the May 15 deadline.  Medicaid spending was about 
9 percent lower in March than it was last year; this decline reflects the shift to Medicare of drug spending for elderly Medicaid patient s as well as apparent delays in federal 
Medicaid payments to some big states.    The relatively brisk pace of federal spe nding was also reflected in NIPA federal 
purchases in the first quarter.  Real NIPA defense purchases in creased at an annual rate of 
10¼ percent, while spending for hurricane disaster  relief helped boost the growth of real 
NIPA nondefense purchases to an annual rate of 11¾ percent.     Several legislative actions  that would affect the budget remain unresolved.  A 
supplemental appropriations bill providing ad ditional funding for the war on terrorism  
                                                
 
13 Apart from our routine timing shift adjustments, we have made an additional adjustment to March 
refunds and EITC outlays.  Refund payments are typi cally very large on Fridays, and there were five 
Fridays this March, as opposed to four last year.

and for hurricane disaster relief has passed th e House, but a larger  bill that would add 
even more funding for disaster relief and other nondefense programs is under consideration in the Senate.  In addition, the House and Senate have been unable to agree 
on a final tax reconciliation bill for fiscal 2006.  This legislation is likely to extend both 
the alternative minimum tax relief that expi red at the end of 2005 and the lower rates on 
dividends and capital gains that  are set to expire after 2008.  Finally, the Senate passed a 
budget resolution that would allow $16 billion more in budget authority for fiscal 2007 
than was requested in the President’s budget, but  the House has not yet been able to pass 
a fiscal 2007 budget resolution.    
State and Local Government Sector  
Real state and local purchases appear to have posted anothe r small increase in the first 
quarter of 2006.
14  Employment rose 10,000 per mont h, on average, during the first 
quarter, a rate consistent with the gradual pace of hiring that has been evident over the 
past two years.  All of the first-quarter hiring was by local governments.  Meanwhile, real 
construction expenditures fell again in the fi rst quarter and stood around the lower end of 
the narrow range that has prevailed since 2002.   The recent news on the sector’s fiscal situation has generally been favorable.  On the basis of partial data, we estimate that the NIPA measure of stat e and local net saving—
which is similar to the surplu s in an operating budget—exceed ed $15 billion at an annual 
rate in the first quarter af ter having totaled just $3 b illion in 2005.  The National 
Conference of State Legislatures likewise reported that state budget positions have 
continued to improve and attributed the im provement to robust growth in revenues.  
Local governments also appear to have fared relatively well of late, mainly because of 
substantial increases in property taxes, whic h rose 7½ percent in calendar year 2005 after 
a similar increase in 2004.   
Prices  
Overall PCE prices rose 0.4 percent in March after having edged up 0.1 percent in

14 We estimate that real spending on consumption and gross investment by state and local governments 
rose at an annual rate of about ½ percent in the first quarter, whereas the BEA’s advance estimate had shown no change.  The anticipated revision is ba sed on the monthly construction data, which became 
available after the NIPA release and im ply that real construction fell at an annual rate of about 3 percent in 
the first quarter; the advance NIPA estimate had shown a drop in real construction of 7½ percent.

prices rose 2.9 percent, a slightly faster  pace than that of the preceding twelve-month 
period.  Excluding food and energy, the twelve -month change in PCE prices was 2.0, a 
bit less than in the previous year.  PCE energy prices increased 1.4 percent in March, more than reversing February’s 
decline.  Although the price of natural gas fell again because of continued plentiful 
inventories, retail gasoline pr ices have surged almost 70 cen ts per gallon (n.s.a.) since 
their recent trough in mid-February.  About half  of that increase reflects higher crude oil 
costs, while the remainder repres ents higher gasoline margins.   
 The bulk of the increase in gasoline margins is  due to the tight supply situation.  Gasoline 
inventories ran off sharply in March and April, as an unusual amount of refinery 
maintenance and repairs delayed the normal seasonal pickup in gasoline production.  In 
addition, some of the recent increase in gasoline prices is the result of a switch by refiners 
to a more expensive method of producing refo rmulated gasoline that relies on ethanol.
15  
Finally, concerns about disruptions in supply this summer have probably raised 
wholesalers’ desired inventories above th e level that is normal for the season. 
 PCE food prices inched up 0.1 percent in both February and March af ter a large increase 
in January; the twelve-month change was 2.5 pe rcent.   The March figure was held down 
by a substantial decline in consum er prices of fresh fruits and vegetables that offset some 
of their increases over the previous three months.   
 Core PCE price inflation increased 0.3 percen t in March, after increase of 0.1 percent in 
January and February.  Much of this pickup in core price inflation reflected a jump in the 
index for apparel that unwound its February decline.  In addition, core inflation was 
boosted by a one-time step-up in medical prices resulting from the C ongress’s repeal of a 
4½ percent cut in Medicare payments to physicians that had been implemented in 
January.  Over the twelve months ending in  March, prices of non-energy services rose 
2.9 percent, the same as the year-earlier in crease, while core g oods prices edged down 
0.2 percent, compared with a sma ll increase in the previous year. 
                                                
 
15 In the past, gasoline with the additive MTBE was mandated by the Clean Air Act for use in areas of 
the country with particularly high levels of smog.  However, these regulations are set to expire on May 5.  Out of fear of litigation over MTBE’s contribution to water pollution and under federal and state pressure 
to increase their use of ethanol, gasoline producers are already making reformulated gasoline with ethanol 
instead of MTBE, even though the ethanol mix is at least 15 cents per gallon more costly to produce and 
distribute than the MTBE mix.  Reformulated gasoline constitutes about 30 percent of total U.S. gasoline 
consumption.

Inflation expectations have moved up recen tly, both for the coming year and for the 
longer term.  The Michigan SRC measure of  median one-year inflation expectations 
increased ¼ percentage point in April, to 3.3 percent; median five- to ten-year inflation 
expectations rose similarly, to 3.1 percent.  As of May 2, inflation compensation implied 
by rate spreads on nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury bonds was about 2.6 percent for 
five-year maturities and 2.7 percent for ten- year maturities; both figures are about 
0.2 percentage point higher than at the time of the March Greenbook.  
 The price index for gross domestic purchases  excluding food and energy rose 2.7 percent 
over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, a bout the same rate as in the previous 
year.  An acceleration in nonresidential cons truction prices was offset by the deceleration 
in core consumer prices.  The increase in the producer price index ( PPI) for core intermed iate goods rose just 
0.1 percent in March after sizable  increases in January and Febr uary.  Prices of a number 
of energy-intensive components, such as i ndustrial chemicals, turned down in March 
(perhaps responding to the first- quarter decline in na tural gas prices) af ter large increases 
in previous months.  In contra st, producer prices of energy-in tensive services, such as air 
and rail transport, rose sharply in March, continuing the string of increases posted over 
the preceding year.  
 Surging metals prices pushed up the PPI for core crude materials in February and March 
to a level more than 13 percent above that of a year earlier.  In the past six weeks, the 
Journal of Commerce (JOC) metals index has risen an additional 11 percent.  Copper and 
zinc prices have risen 46 per cent and 33 percent, respectively, and prices of several other 
metals are also up sharply.
16  The broader JOC industrial price index has moved up 
5¾ percent since late March, while the Comm odity Research Bureau spot industrial 
index, which excludes energy items, has risen 6 percent over the same period.  
 
Labor Costs  
Over the three months ending in March, th e employment cost index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation of private industry workers rose  at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, the 
slowest pace in several years.  On a twelve-month-change basis, the ECI increased 2.6 percent, 0.9 percentage point less than in the previous year.   
                                                
 
16 The recent enormous increases in metals prices re portedly have several causes in addition to strong 
demand, including labor unrest at copper mines in Mexico and Chile and the possibility of another miners’ 
strike at Canada’s zinc mines at the end of May.

The wages and salaries component of the ECI rose at a 2.8 percent annual rate over the 
first three months of this year.  Over th e past twelve months, this component rose 
2.4 percent, ¼ percentage point less than the previous year.  The deceleration in this 
index of wage change, which is calculated  using fixed industry -occupation weights and 
covers both production and non-pr oductions workers, contrasts with the uptrend in the 
payroll survey measure of average hourly ea rnings, which is unweighted and only covers 
production workers.  Average hourly earnings were up 3.4 percent in the twelve months 
ending in March, compared with a rise  of 2.6 percent a year earlier.   
 Benefit costs, as measured in the ECI, rose at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the three 
months ending in March, the slowest rate in the past seven years.  Benefit costs have 
risen only 3 percent over the past twelve m onths, about 2½ percentage  points slower than 
in the previous year.  The biggest single contri butor to the slower rise in benefit costs was 
a sharp deceleration in employers’ current pa yments for their workers’ defined benefit 
retirement plans—perhaps reflecting higher stoc k market returns over the past few years.  
Also, employers’ contributions for health in surance decelerated ove r the twelve months 
ending in March, and increases in over time pay and bonuses slowed markedly. 
 
On the basis of personal income data a nd employee hours for the first quarter, we 
estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfar m business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 5 percent.  However, that increase left the four-quarter change  at 3.6 percent—below 
the average pace of the preceding few years.   Despite the first-quarter pickup in 
compensation growth, the markup over unit la bor costs in the nonfarm business sector 
remained high relative to its historical average.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Monetary policy expectations firmed, on ba lance, over the interm eeting period, as the 
effects of stronger-than-expected  data releases were only par tly offset by Federal Reserve 
communications that were inte rpreted as suggesting that th e end of the tig htening cycle 
was approaching.  Reflecting the upward shift in policy expectations and, perhaps, some 
rebound in term premiums, long-term yields moved up considerably and the ten-year 
Treasury yield reached its highe st level since June 2002.  St ock price indexes ended the 
period up slightly, as the influence of positive earnings reports apparently outweighed the 
effects of higher interest ra tes and energy prices.  Busi ness credit quality remained 
strong, and corporate bond spreads remained  low.  Household credit quality also 
continued to be solid overal l, although delinquency rates on mortgages have risen a bit 
since the middle of 2005.  Little new data are yet available to assess the effect of higher 
interest rates on household mo rtgage borrowing this year. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates  
The decision at the March FOMC meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis 
points, to 4¾ percent, came as no surprise to market participants; nonetheless, near-term 
federal funds futures rates edged up on the acco mpanying statement, reportedly in part 
because of the retention of the language that “some further policy firming may be 
needed.”  More-recent Federal Reserve co mmunications—including the release of the 
minutes of the March FOMC meeting and the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint 
Economic Committee—had a more substantial effect on policy expectations in the 
opposite direction.  In contrast, data releases  over the intermeeting period were generally 
read by investors as pointing to stronger grow th and greater inflation pressures than had 
been anticipated and pushed up the expected  path for policy.  Over the intermeeting 
period, money market futures rates for the e nd of this year and beyond rose about 20 to 
30 basis points on net.  Judging from federal f unds futures, investors currently are nearly 
certain of a 25 basis point increase at the May FOMC meeting and assign about a one-
third probability to a like-si zed rate hike in June.  Ar ound the end of this year, the 
expected policy path begins to tilt down.  Uncertainty about the future path of policy 
further out, implied by options on Eurodollar fu tures, remained about unchanged at a low 
level.  Nominal Treasury yields rose over the interm eeting period.  Yields at the two- and ten-
year maturities increased about 20 and 40 ba sis points, respectivel y, leaving the yield 
curve modestly steeper and the ten-year rate at levels last seen in June 2002.  Distant-
horizon forward rates rose substantially more  than near-term ones, suggesting some

rebound in term premiums from their recent exceptionally low levels.  The causes of this 
rise in term premiums are hard to iden tify but may include heightened inflation 
uncertainty sparked by recent economic data releases, some waning of foreign demand 
for Treasury securities, and some reassessment of the pricing of interest rate risk.  
Inflation compensation over the next five years, measured by Treasury inflation-protected 
securities, rose about 15 basi s points over the period, while inflation compensation five to 
ten years ahead increased about 25 basis points.  
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad equity market indexes edged up on net over the intermeeting period, as generally 
positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the effects of higher interest rates and increased prices for energy and raw materials.  The ratio of trend earnings to price for 
the S&P 500, a measure of long-run expected eq uity returns, remained near 5½ percent, 
where it has hovered for the past several years.   At the same time, the recent increase in 
the long-term real Treasury yield has narro wed the equity premium a bit and brought it 
closer to its average level over the past two decades.  Im plied volatility on the S&P 500 
remained near its recent low levels.      Over the intermeeting period, yields on inve stment-grade corporate bonds moved up in 
line with those on comparable-maturity Treas ury securities, so ri sk spreads on those 
bonds were about unchanged.  In contrast, yields on high-yield corporate bonds were 
little changed, and their risk spreads narrowed about 25 basis points.  The low level of 
high-yield bond spreads likely reflects inve stors’ sanguine view of corporate credit 
quality over the next couple of  years.  In the commercial paper market, the thirty-day 
quality spread also remained low.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
First-quarter earnings reports ha ve been quite favorable thus  far, with only a few firms 
reporting profits below analysts ’ expectations and with gui dance for the second quarter 
more positive than typical.  Based on repor ts from about 350 companies in the S&P 500, 
aggregate earnings per share in the first quarter are estimated to have increased  
15 percent from a year earlier,  extending the series of double- digit increases seen over the 
past several years.  The repor ts led analysts to revise up their year-ahead earnings 
expectations modestly, even  outside the energy sector. 
 
Bolstered by robust earnings and strong bala nce sheets, measures of aggregate business 
credit quality continued to show few signs of stress.  Although bond rating downgrades

from Moody’s increased in the first quarter,  downgrades of securitie s issued by Ford and 
General Motors represented more than half of  the total.  Since December, the six-month 
trailing bond default rate has dropped off, a nd just a few firms defaulted in the first 
quarter.  A measure of aggregate expected defaults over the next year, based on Moody’s 
KMV data, remained at a low level in March.         
 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms re mained brisk in Ap ril and acquisition-
related financing again accounted for a notable  part of issuance.  C&I loans outstanding 
are estimated to have grown at a double-dig it rate in April, while commercial paper 
continued to move up.  In total, net debt fi nancing by nonfinancial corporations in April 
likely stayed near its robust first-quarter pace.  Gross public equity issuance remained subdue d over the intermeeting period, as a slight 
pickup in initial public offerings was more than  offset by a decline in seasoned offerings.  
Meanwhile, equity retirements have been torr id.  Equity retired in the first quarter 
through cash mergers, which continue to be driven by a surge in leveraged buyout 
activity, exceeded even the hi gh rate seen in 2005.  In a ddition, corporate announcements 
suggest that the first-quarter pace of share repurchases, supported by robust earnings and 
liquid balance sheets, likely surpassed the record clip of the second half of 2005. 
  
Commercial Real Estate  
Commercial mortgage debt appe ars to have expanded rapidly in the first quarter, and the 
issuance calendar for commercial-mortgage-b acked securities (CMBS) suggests that 
borrowing will remain strong in the near te rm despite an increase in commercial-
mortgage interest rates to th eir highest levels since 2004.  At the same time, spreads on 
BBB-rated CMBS over Treasury securities of comparable maturities have declined 
sharply in recent weeks, reversing last fall’ s run-up and bringing spreads back in line 
with those on similarly-rated corporat e bonds.  Delinquency rates remained low by 
historical standards, and a decl ine in vacancy rates and some firming in rents in the first 
quarter reflected further improve ment in market fundamentals. 
 The ratio of net operating income to property pr ices—an indicator of th e rate of return on 
commercial real estate—continued its downtrend in the first quar ter.  The spread of this 
ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yi eld, a rough measure of the risk premium on 
commercial real estate assets , narrowed in the first quarter.  In addition, the recent

Household Finance  
Average interest rates on both thirty-year  fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgages continued to climb over the inte rmeeting period.  However, the degree to 
which higher interest rates may have redu ced household mortgage borrowing remains 
unclear, because only limited data are availa ble for early 2006.  Consumer credit—which 
has accounted for a small share of total household borrowing in recent years—has 
continued to rise only modestly.  Household credit quality remained solid in  the first few months of 2006, even as the 
financial obligations ratio app ears to have stayed near the top of its historical range.  
Household bankruptcy filings in recent months  continued to run at low levels.  The 
cumulative number of filings si nce the beginning of last year  is only a little above the 
corresponding figure for the year-earlier period, a development consistent with the view 
that much of the rush to file before bankr uptcy reform in October 2005 reflected a shift 
from subsequent months.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans have remained low, albeit in part because of the hi gh rate of charge-offs after last  fall’s bankruptcy surge.  In 
contrast, while the delinquenc y rate among prime mortgage borrowers continued to be 
low and stable, mortgage delinquencies am ong subprime borrowers have moved up in 
recent quarters.  Even though part of the rise is  attributable to the effects of last fall’s 
hurricanes, there also has been a modest de terioration in some households’ ability to 
make their mortgage payments outside of  the hurricane-affected areas.     
 Although the Office of Federal Housing En terprise Oversight (OFHEO) repeat-
transactions house-price index for the first quarter will not be released until June 1, 
monthly indicators of new and existing home pr ices so far this year hint that the long-
expected cooling in house-price apprecia tion may have begun.  Even with some 
moderation in house-price gains, the ratio of  household net worth to disposable income 
likely increased in the first quarter, booste d by rising stock prices.  Net purchases of 
equity mutual funds during the first four months  of this year were stronger than in any 
four-month period since early 2000, and a dispro portionate share of the inflows continued 
to go to international funds.

Treasury and Agency Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury c onducted auctions of two- and five-year 
nominal notes and five- and ten-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).   
Demand for securities in these auctions was generally on the weak side.  The five-year 
TIPS auction was particularly poorly receive d, as indicated by an unusually low bid-to-
cover ratio.  At just 13 percent in March, the proportion of nominal coupon securities 
bought by foreign investors continued to fall back  from the peak of 24 percent reached in 
2004.  Agency stock prices were down roughly 5 percent over the inte rmeeting period in 
reaction to rising mortgage interest rates and Freddie Mac's long-delayed, but still 
disappointing, earnings report.  There was only muted stock pr ice reaction to statements 
by Treasury Secretary Snow and Chairman Bern anke affirming that the Department of 
the Treasury has the authority to limit agen cy debt issuance, but the comments may have 
contributed to a 5 basis point narrowing in agency debt spreads.  Announcements that 
Freddie Mac will pay $410 million in cash to se ttle shareholder lawsuits and that OFHEO 
will soon release a report expected to give a negative assessment of Fannie Mae’s past 
accounting practices elicited litt le response from investors. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds picked up a bit in  April from the tepid pace 
of the first quarter.  New capital issuance rebounded, while refunding issuance fell further 
because of the increases in interest rates.  The volume of short-term issuance in April 
continued to be light, a sign of impr oved budget conditions in many states.  
     Ratings upgrades have been numerous, while do wngrades have been scarce so far this 
year.  In line with improving credit qual ity, yields on long-dated municipal bonds 
increased less than those on comparable-mat urity Treasury securitie s, sharply reducing 
the yield ratio.  While market commentary offe rs little explanation for this move, similar 
large swings in the yield ratio have o ccurred periodically in past years.

Growth in bank credit is estimated to have re mained brisk in April.  Respondents to the 
April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey re ported a further easing of lending standards 
and terms on business loans but little change in demand, on net.  Despite a contraction in 
home equity lines of credit, which likely result ed from rising interest rates, real estate 
loans expanded steadily in April.  Apart from  the effect of a bank’s acquisition of a large 
thrift institution, consumer loans at banks were  about flat in March but grew moderately 
in April. 
Appendix  
 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The April 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also contained a set of special questions on the minimum required paymen t on outstanding credit card balances of 
individuals and households. This appendix is based on responses from fifty-seven 
domestic banks and nineteen foreign banking institutions. 
 In the April survey, domestic commercial ba nks reported a further net easing of lending 
standards and terms for commercial and indus trial (C&I) loans, while lending standards 
on commercial real estate loans were reportedly unchanged.  At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, lending standard s on both C&I and commercial real estate 
loans were little changed, on net, but lik e their domestic counterparts, foreign 
institutions reported a net easing of terms on C&I loans.  Demand for both C&I and 
commercial real estate loans at domestic banks had changed little over the previous 
three months.  By contrast, foreign institu tions experienced, on balance, weaker demand 
for both C&I and commercial real estate loans over the same period.  In the household sector, credit standards on residential mo rtgages and consumer loans were little 
changed, on net, during the survey period.   A moderate net fraction of domestic 
respondents reported weaker demand for mortgages to purchase homes, while a larger net fraction saw weaker demand for consumer loans over the past three months.    
Business Lending  
In the April survey, domestic banks indi cated that they had further eased credit 
standards and terms on C&I loans over the past  three months.  On net, 12 percent of 
domestic institutions indicated that they ha d eased standards on such loans to large and 
middle-market firms, roughly the same net percentage as in the January survey.  About 60 percent of domestic respondents—a notably la rger net fraction than in the previous 
survey—reported that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for such firms.  Almost 40 percent of domes tic institutions—again a larger net fraction 
than in the January survey—indicated that they had reduced the costs of credit lines 
over the past three months.  About one-fifth of domestic banks, on balance, noted that 
they had increased the maximum maturity of  C&I loans or credit lines that they are 
willing to extend to their business borrowers.        For C&I loans to small firms, 7 percent of domestic respondents, on net, noted that they had eased lending standards in the April survey.  On balance, almost 50 percent of respondents indicated that they had narrowed sp reads of loan rates over their cost of

funds, and about 30 percent of them reporte d having reduced the cost of credit lines 
over the same period.  As they did in the previous two surveys, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
reported essentially no change in their cred it standards on C&I loans over the survey 
period.  Nonetheless, significant net fractions of these institutions noted that they had narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost  of funds and reduced the cost of credit 
lines.      Nearly all domestic respondents that reporte d an easing of their lending standards or 
terms on C&I loans in the April survey pointed to more-aggressive competition from 
other banks or nonbank lenders as an importa nt reason for having done so.  Significant 
net percentages also cited increased liquid ity in the secondary market for these loans 
and increased tolerance for risk as reas ons for their move toward a more 
accommodative lending posture.  On balance, demand for C&I loans from both large and middle-market firms and small firms was reportedly little changed in the April survey at domestic institutions.  By contrast, 16 percent of foreign respondents, on balance, noted that they had experienced 
weaker demand for C&I loans over the previous three months.  Among domestic respondents that experienced stronger dema nd for C&I loans, all cited borrowers’ 
increased needs to finance investment in plant or equipment, while three-quarters 
pointed to increased needs to finance merger s and acquisitions as reasons for the pickup 
in demand.  Among domestic institutions th at experienced weaker demand for C&I 
loans, 90 percent indicated that customers’  internally generated funds had increased, a 
pattern of responses consistent with continued strong corporate profitability. 
Nonetheless, about 60 percent of these banks  also pointed to borrowers’ decreased 
needs to finance investment in plant or e quipment as a reason for weaker loan demand. 
Regarding future business, about 10 percent of both domestic and foreign institutions, 
on balance, indicated that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers had increased over the previous three months.    Domestic institutions reported essentially no change in their lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the past thr ee months, on balance.  Similarly, a large 
majority of foreign respondents indicated th at they had not changed standards on such 
loans.  On net, 5 percent of domestic ba nks saw an increase in demand for commercial 
real estate loans over the past three mont hs, about the same net fraction as in the 
January survey.  By contrast, about one-four th of foreign institutions reported that 
demand for this type of loan was weaker over the same period. 
 III-A-5   
 
 
Household Lending 
On net, 10 percent of domestic institutions noted that they had eased credit standards on 
residential mortgage loans over the past th ree months.  Almost one-fourth of domestic 
banks experienced weaker demand for mortgages to purchase homes, but this net fraction was considerably smaller than in the January survey.      About 15 percent of domestic respondent s, on balance, reported an increased 
willingness to make consumer installment loan s over the past three months.  Standards 
and most terms on credit card and non-credit- card consumer loans were reportedly little 
changed, on net, in the April survey.  Ho wever, for the second consecutive survey, one-
quarter of respondents indicated that they had increased the minimum percent of outstanding credit card balances required to  be repaid each month.  Demand for 
consumer loans reportedly weakened further over the past three months:  More than 
one-fourth of domestic banks, on net, saw w eaker demand for such loans, about the 
same net fraction as in the previous survey.   To help the Federal Reserve improve its estimat e of the financial obligations ratio in the 
household sector, the current survey contained a set of special questions regarding minimum required payments on the credit car d balances of individuals and households. 
 Twenty-nine domestic institutions responded to these special questions.
1  About three-
quarters of these respondents indicated that the minimum required payment is calculated simply as a percentage of tota l outstanding balances.  For banks that 
calculate the minimum required payment in such a manner, responses regarding the size 
of this percentage varied notably.  About 75 percent indicated that this percentage was 
more than 1.5 percent but less than or equal to 3.0 percent of total outstanding balances, 
with about 30 percent reporting a percen tage at the high end of this range. 
 Institutions that do not calculate the mini mum required payment on credit card balances 
simply as a percentage of total outstanding balances were asked to estimate the portion of such minimum required payment attributable to fees, finance charges, and repayment of principal.  Three-quarters of these respondents indicated that the approximate ratio of fees required to be paid to total outsta nding balances was less than or equal to  
0.20 percent—the remainder reported higher ra tios.  Regarding the ratio of finance 
charges required to be paid to total outsta nding balances, all but one financial institution

higher ratios.  Banks were also asked to report what frac tion of individuals a nd households paid only 
the minimum required amount on their outstanding credit card balances in recent months.  About 70 percent of respondents noted that 15 percent or less of their customers paid the minimum required amount last month.  The banks indicated that a similar percentage of individuals and house holds paid the minimum required amount in 
each of the last three months.  Finally, one-third of respondents, on net, indicated that they had increased their minimum required payment on credit card balances of individuals and households over the past year.

The U.S. international trade deficit narro wed to $65.7 billion in February from 
$68.6 billion in January (revised).  The narrowi ng of the deficit reflected a sharp decrease 
in imports, which more than offset a modest fall in exports.

In February, the value of exports of goods and services fell 1.2 percent from a high 
January level.  Exports dec lined across all major product ca tegories, with exports of 
agricultural products, industria l supplies, and capital goods showing the largest drops.  
Within capital goods, a large increase in exports of aircraft was more than offset by declines in exports of com puters, semiconductors, and other capital goods.  Exports of 
automotive products also moved down somewh at, as did exports of consumer goods.  
Services exports declined a bit, largely on acc ount of weaker exports of travel services.  
 
The average value of exports in January and February increased 16½ percent (a.r.) from 
the fourth quarter.  Exports of industrial supplies and capital goods were particularly 
strong.  In real terms, according to the adva nce NIPA release which includes the BEA’s 
estimate of nominal trade in March, exports of goods and services increased 12 percent 
(a.r.) in the first quarter, following a rise of just 5 percent in the fourth quarter.

The value of imported goods and services dec lined 2.3 percent in Fe bruary after surging 
in January.  The decline in imports was wi despread across categories with the exception 
of imports of oil, which were flat.  Im ports of capital goods fell back sharply, led by 
declines in imports of othe r capital goods (machinery).  Im ports of automotive products 
more than reversed January’s steep climb, but still remained at a high level.  A fall in 
imports of cell phones contribute d to a decline in imports of consumer goods, while weak 
imports of chemicals held back imports of non-oil industrial supplies.   Imports of foods 
also moved down following a surge in January.  In contrast, imports of services jumped, 
boosted by licensing payments for broadcast righ ts for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games.  
 
The average value of imports in January and February increased 13½ percent (a.r.) from 
the fourth quarter.  Imports of automo tive products, capital goods , consumer goods, and 
industrial supplies were all strong.  In th e advance NIPA releas e which includes the 
BEA’s estimate of nominal trade in March, real imports of good and services rose 
13 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, following a rise of 12 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In March, BLS import prices of non-oil goods fell 0.3 percent, while 
prices of imported core goods were unchange d.  A 13 percent decline in the price for 
imported natural gas, a category that we now  exclude from core imports, was the main 
reason for the difference.  Within core im ports, prices for non-fuel industrial supplies 
rose 0.8 percent in March, reflecting further increases in the prices for metals, and food 
prices rose 0.4 percent.  Thes e increases were offset by a 0.2 percent decline in prices of 
consumer goods.  Following two months of in creases, prices for cap ital goods (excluding 
computers and semiconductors) were unchanged in  March, as were prices of automotive 
products.  Prices for imported computers fell 0.5 percent, whereas prices for 
semiconductors edged up 0.1 percent. 
 
In the first quarter, according to the advan ce NIPA release, core import prices rose 
1¾ percent at an annual rate, as  prices in all sub-categorie s posted increa ses with the 
exception of automotive products.  (Accordi ng to the BLS monthly data, these price 
increases occurred mostly in January as core import prices were unchanged in February 
and March.)  The main contri butor to the overall price in crease was non-fuel industrial 
supplies.  Average prices for food also recorded  a large increase.  Prices for capital goods 
(excluding computers and semiconductors) rose at a more modest pace.

however, oil prices have soared  to new highs.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate 
closed at $74.62 per barrel on May 2, up from an average of $62.90 per barrel in March.  
The recent increase in oil prices has been driven by heightened concerns about supply, 
against a backdrop of continued strong globa l demand.  In Nigeria, about 500,000 barrels 
per day of oil production remain offline because  of domestic instability, and the security 
situation there shows little si gns of improvement.  In recent weeks, tensions with Iran 
over its nuclear program have intensified.  In  April, Iran announced that it processed 
enriched uranium despite a warning by the Un ited Nations that doing so could lead to 
economic sanctions.  Also adversely impacting oil supplies are continued violence in Iraq, lasting damage from hurricanes in the Gu lf of Mexico, and a worsening investment 
climate in many oil-producing countries.  Mo reover, low spare production capacity has 
lent upward pressure to oil prices by intens ifying concerns about supply disruptions and 
increasing the demand for inventories.  With world oil demand growth expected to remain relatively robust, market participants appear concerned that capacity additions will have difficulty keeping pace. 
 
Exports.   In March, U.S. export prices of tota l goods and of core goods both increased 
0.2 percent.  Prices for nona gricultural industria l supplies increased 0.5 percent, with 
falling prices for chemicals partially offse tting higher prices for metals and petroleum 
products.  In contrast, agricu ltural prices fell 0.2 percent.  Within finished goods, only 
capital goods (excluding computers and semi conductors) saw an increase, with prices 
increasing 0.2 percent.  Prices of consum er goods fell 0.3 percent, the largest monthly 
decline since February 2002.  In March, pric es for exported computers fell 0.1 percent, 
whereas prices for semiconductors edged up 0.1 percent. 
 
Core export prices rose 3¼ per cent (a.r.) in the first quarter, as prices increased in all sub-
categories with the exception of agricultural products.  A substantial increase in prices for non-agricultural industrial supplies was the main contributor to the overall price increase.  
Prices of capital goods (excluding computer s and semiconductors) and consumer goods 
also increased, but at a slower  rate, in the first quarter. 
  
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) eased in February and again in March af ter a hefty monthly inflow in 
January.  For the quarter as a whole, net inflows are in line with inflows in the fourth quarter and above the average quarterly infl ow for all of 2005.  On net, inflows from 
IV-7 
most regions, including those from OPEC nations (line 1b), moved down over the course 
of the quarter.   
.  Confidential 
data on custody accounts at FRBNY point to aggr egate inflows in April at a pace similar 
to that seen in recent months.       
 As noted in previous Greenbooks, the official  m
 onthly transactions data may understate 
inflows from official sources because they erroneously attribute some foreign official 
flows to the foreign private sector.  For ex ample, there may be misattribution in these 
data if official entities use a foreign intermed iary to acquire U.S. assets.  To the extent 
possible, BEA corrects for this misattribution in  quarterly balance of payments statistics 
using data from FRBNY and el sewhere, and these corrections  are carried through to the 
monthly data shown in the table.    Foreign private purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) picked up for the third consecutive 
month in March, and for the quarter as a w hole, was just below the record level of 
inflows registered in the fourth quarter.  As  is typically the case, robust m 
onthly inflows 
were recorded from the United Kingdom, a major financial center, providing little 
information about the residence of the ulti mate purchaser.  While net purchases of 
Treasury securities (line 4a) were weak in  the first quarter, demand for both agency 
bonds (line 4b) and corporate st ocks (line 4d) continued to trend up on balance.  Demand 
for corporate bonds (line 4c) surg ed in March, and net purchases for the quarter were near 
a record high.      U.S. residents’ acquisitions of foreign securities  (
 line 5) strengthened in the first quarter.  
U.S. investors’ appetite for foreign equ ities (line 5b) remain ed strong throughout the 
quarter, while measured net purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) moved up over the 
period.  The only stock swap recorded in th e quarter is associated with the Israeli 
acquisition of IVAX Corporati on, a generic drug manufacturer .  U.S. acquisitions of 
foreign securities for the year to date are above the average quarterly flows recorded in 
2005.   Net flows through the banking sector (line 3) continued to record sm
 all net outflows in 
each month of the first quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The dollar depreciated broadly and shar ply over the intermeeting period.  This 
development in the dollar may be, to a considerab le degree, the result of a shift in market 
focus toward structural factors,  including the implications of the U.S. external deficit.  
Global long-term yields rose markedly  over the period, buoyed by new data that 
generally reinforced the strong global econom ic outlook, and led market participants to 
expect tighter monetary policy.  Major forei gn equity indexes generally rose, despite the 
rise in yields and soaring energy prices, and financial indicators in the emerging market 
economies improved.

The dollar depreciated noticeably against all major foreign currencies over the 
intermeeting period, and the major currencies index dropped more than 4½ percent on 
net.  The Canadian dollar appreciated about 5 ⅓ percent against the dollar, in part on 
Canadian economic data releases which we re stronger than had been expected, but 
mainly on soaring commodity prices.  The cu rrencies of Australia and New Zealand and 
other commodity-exporting nations, appreciated about 8 and 6 percent,  respectively.  The 
yen appreciated about 3¼ percent against th e dollar over the period, with about one half

which said that “in emerging As ia, particularly China, greater flexibility in exchange 
rates is critical to allow necessary appreciation.”

On April 25, the Bank of Canada increased its policy rate 25 basis points, to 4.0 percent.  
Whereas this decision had been widely expected, the accompanying statement, which 
was interpreted as signaling future policy rate increases, was not.  Canadian three-month rates and ten-year sovereign yields rose 25 and 32 basis points, respectively, over the 
intermeeting period.  In early April, the Eu ropean Central Bank, the Bank of England, 
and the Bank of Japan all kept their respect ive policy rates unchange d.  On net, deposits 
of Japanese financial institutions held at the Bank of Japan decreased about ¥10.5 trillion 
over the intermeeting period, to less than ¥18 tr illion.  Three-month spot interest rates 
were unchanged in Japan and increased 9 ba sis points in the United Kingdom and in 
Germany; ten-year sovereign yields in thes e three countries rose  about 22 to 26 basis 
points.  In Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom, increases in nominal ten-year 
yields were accompanied by similar-sized in creases in real yields, leaving implied 
inflation compensation rates little changed.  Headline equity indexe s rose about 1 to 3 
percent in Japan, the United Kingdom, and th e euro area.  The strength of the global 
IV-11 
economy and some stronger-than-expected earn ings reports supporte d share prices, but 
these were partly offset by rising yields and soaring energy prices.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
Incoming data in the foreign industrial econom ies are generally favorable and point to 
continued expansion.  P
reliminary GDP for the United Kingdom rose 2.6 percent in the 
first quarter.  Canadian monthly GDP through Februa ry showed that domestic demand, 
particularly consumption, remained strong .  Monthly indicators suggest that the recovery 
in Japan is ongoing and that euro-area GDP gr owth has rebounded from its fourth-quarter 
slowdown.    Increases in oil and other primary commodity pr ices have raised headline inflation rates 
abroad, but core inflation has stayed well contained.  Core inflation edged up in the euro 
area in February and rem
ained stable in Cana da through March.  In Japan, core consumer 
price inflation has now been slightly positive fo r the last several months.  Inflation in the 
United Kingdom dropped unexpectedly in March as food prices fell.  Indicators of activity in Japan point to continued growth.
  The Bank of Japan's Tankan 
diffusion index of business conditions for firms of all sizes and industries remained at its 
recent high of 5 in March.  Industrial production rose 0.6 percent in the first quarter while 
the manufacturing PMI remained near record highs.  Activity in the construction and service sectors also appeared to be solid, as  housing starts rose 1.5 percent in the first 
quarter and the tertiary services index was a bove its fourth quarter average over the first 
two months of the year.  Although real spen ding in the first quarter by households fell, 
retail sales rose 1.8 percent and auto registrations rose 3.3 per cent.  The real trade balance 
improved in the first quarter, as exports ro se 3.4 percent and imports rose 2.4 percent
.  
 The labor market continued to improve in the first quarter with em
 ployment rising 
0.3 percent and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 percent, the lo west rate in eight 
years.  The offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings 

IV-13 
relative to the number of officially register ed job seekers) fell slightly in March but 
remained near a thirteen-year high. The Marc h Tankan survey also signaled a tighter 
labor market, as the number of firms reporting an insufficient number of employees rose.  
Nominal wages were up 0.2 percent in February  compared with the same month a year 
earlier.  
 
Core consumer prices (which exclude fres h food but include ener gy) in the Tokyo area 
were unchanged in April but were 0.3 percen t higher than a year ago.  Core consumer 
prices for the country as a w hole were 0.5 percent higher in March than a year earlier.  
Much of the increase was due to energy pri ces, however, and consumer prices for the 
country excluding both fresh food and energy were only 0.2 percent higher than a year 
earlier.  Twelve-month wholesale price inflati on was 2.7 percent in March.  It was also 
reported that last year commercial land prices rose in Japan's major metropolitan areas for 
the first time in 15 years; they were up 1 percent from a year earlier.  
 
The outstanding balance of reserves accounts held by the Bank of Japan has steadily 
decreased since the Bank announced an end to its policy of quantitative easing.  Reserves 
fell to ¥19 trillion in April, well below th e ¥30 trillion floor set under quantitative easing, 
and are expected to continue falling for several more months. Yields on ten-year 
government bonds have risen 30 basis points sinc e the end of quantitative easing.  In the 
April release of its semiannual Outlook the Ba nk of Japan’s board members revised their 
median forecast for real GDP growth in cu rrent fiscal year up from 1.8 percent to 
2.4 percent while their forecast for core CP I inflation was revised up one tenth to 
0.6 percent.  For the following fiscal year, board members predicted that real GDP would 
grow 2.0 percent and core CPI inflat ion would rise to 0.8 percent.

In the euro area , survey indicators of activity have risen to high levels and hard data 
have begun to confirm the increased pace of  activity.  The PMI for the manufacturing 
sector advanced further in April to 56.7  (where 50 is the thres hold for positive growth), 
the highest level since 2000.  The PMI for serv ices remained elevated in March near 58.  
Importantly, the employment components of both PMI surveys have made strong gains 
recently, an indication that firms are likely to step up hiring.  In another sign of an 
improving labor market, the euro-area unemplo yment rate edged dow n to 8.1 percent in 
March, versus 8.8 percent one year ago. 
 
Euro-area industrial production was flat in February, but the January-February average 
level was 0.8 percent above the fourth-quarter average.  Euro -area industrial orders rose 
sharply in February for the second straight month, suggesting that strength in production 
is likely to persist.  The German manufacturi ng sector has continued to show particular 
strength, with the IFO business climate index rising to a 15-year high in April.  German 
industrial production increased 1 percent in  February, and the January number was 
revised up from a small decline to a 0.4 per cent increase.  The February increase was 
particularly sharp in the energy and constr uction sectors, with the latter rebounding from 
IV-15 
the effects of January's unusually severe weat her.  Manufacturing output registered fairly 
strong gains, with capital goods production increasing robustly, al though consumer goods 
production was little changed. 
 
Indicators of euro-area consumption have been mixed.  The average volume of euro-area 
retail sales fell slightly in February from th e previous month but average sales for January 
and February were up 0.3 percent from the fourth quarter.  French consumption of 
manufactured products moved lower in March but posted a strong 1.1 percent gain for the 
first quarter as a whole.  German consumer spending was a relative weak spot, with retail 
sales falling sharply in March.  Euro-area co nsumer confidence moved back up in April 
to the 3½-year high reached in February.    
 
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer  price inflation edged down to 2.2 percent 
in March.  Core inflation, excluding ener gy and unprocessed food, continued to be well-
behaved, edging up from 1.3 percent in February  to 1.4 percent in March.  The European 
Central Bank held its main refinancing rate at 2.5 percent at its April meeting.  In the 
post-meeting statement, President Trichet punctured market expectations of a May 
interest rate hike but left the door wide open fo r a rise in June.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 2.6 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, according to 
a preliminary estimate.  The production sector  rose 0.7 percent compared with a fall of 
0.9 in the fourth quarter of 2005.  All pr oduction sectors showed positive growth.  
Manufacturing rose 0.5 percent co mpared with a fall of 1.1 in  the fourth quarter.  The 
services sector grew by 0.6 pe rcent, a slowing of growth compared with the previous 
quarter when it grew by 1.0 percent. 
 
The housing sector is continui ng its recovery, with house pric es increasing at an annual 
rate of around 9 percent in the first quarter, and mortga ge lending approaching the 
previous high of £10 billion achieved in late 2003.   
 
The twelve-month change in consumer pr ices dropped back sharply from 2.1 to 
1.8 percent in March, below the Bank of Engla nd’s target of 2 percent.  The fall in 
inflation owed to a decline in food prices, pa rticularly milk.  Consumer prices, excluding 
energy, fell from 1.4 percent in February to 1.1 percent in March.  In its April minutes the 
Bank of England’s Monetary Po licy Committee voted to keep its policy rate constant at 
4.5 percent.

In Canada, GDP by industry rose 2.7 percent (a.r .) in February, with activity in 
residential building construc tion and wholesale trade cont inuing to grow briskly.  
Following a sharp decline in January due to mild weathe r, the energy sector rebounded, 
in particular the utilities industries.  A si zable drop in the manufacturing, mining, and oil 
and gas extraction sector s restrained growth. 
 
Overall, other indicators for the first quart er have been positive.  Housing starts 
accelerated throughout the quarter, with starts  in March hitting their highest monthly 
level during the current housi ng boom, which began in 2002.  Retail sales continued to 
climb in February.  The composite index of  leading indicators advanced sharply in 
March, with only two of ten components, both related to manufacturing, retreating.  The 
manufacturing sector continue s to struggle, with shipme nts and new orders both down 
substantially in February. 
 
IV-18 
The labor market continued its recent roll  in March, posting a net gain of 51,000 jobs, 
most of which were full-time positions.  The unemployment rate dipped in March to 
6.3 percent, a 32-year-low, a nd the employment rate (the  ratio of the working age 
population that is employed) hi t a record high 62.9 percent. 
    
In March, the twelve-month ra te of consumer price inflation remained unchanged from 
its February rate of 2.2 percent.  The twelve -month rate of core inflation, which excludes 
the eight most volatile components, remained unchanged at 1.7 percent. 
 
On April 25, the Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnigh t rate ¼ percentage 
point to 4 percent, following ¼ percentage point increases at each of its previous five meetings.  The accompanying statement noted that the Bank would monitor developments closely “…in light of the cumulative increase in the policy rate since last September,” but also that “…some modest furt her increase in the policy interest rate may 
be required to keep aggregate supply and de mand in balance and infl ation on target over 
the medium term.”  On May 2, the Canadian  government released a budget plan.  The 
central feature of the plan is a one-percentage  point cut in the Goods  and Services Tax, 
effective July 1.  Also planned is a corporat e income tax cut that would cut the rate to 
19 percent by 2010, from its current 21 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent economic indicators from the emer ging market economies suggest a slight 
deceleration in activity from the strong fourth -quarter pace, although with some variation 
across countries.  Chinese growth surged in the first quarter, but advanced estimates of 
first-quarter GDP for Korea a nd Singapore pointed to some slowing from the rapid pace 
observed in the second half of 2005.  Indicators for Mexico point to strength in the first 
quarter, with industrial activity finally bounci ng back after being w eak last year, but 
elsewhere in Latin America indicators are not as positive.  Despite two years of increases 
in oil prices, twelve-month consumer price inflation moved down in recent months in 
most of the major emerging market economies.  Monetary policy was tightened in several 
emerging Asian economies since the last Gr eenbook, while there was some easing in 
monetary policy in Latin America. 
 
Chinese  real GDP grew almost 13 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter according to staff 
estimates.  In releasing the figures, Chinese o fficials cited a surge in investment as well 
as stronger exports.  In la te April, the Chinese government announced that controls on 
credit and land use, as well as stricter approva l criteria for investment projects, would be 
used to slow investment growth in several s ectors.  These measures to slow investment 
follow similar measures enacted by the Ch inese government only one month ago.  In 
addition, the People’s Bank of China raised the benchmark one-year bank lending rate 27 basis points in late April.  The trade bala nce set a new quarterly record in the first 
quarter, reaching an annual rate of almost $130 billion, with exports  accelerating after a 
relatively weak fourth quarter.  Consumer pr ice inflation moved down in the quarter to a 
four-quarter change of 1.2 percent, as  food price inflation dipped noticeably. 
 
The Chinese government announced that restrictions on capital outflows from China would be lessened effective May 1.  The new program will allow domestic institutional investors to take money out of China for the purpose of investing in foreign fixed income 
securities.

In Taiwan , industrial production rose slightly on ba lance in the first quarter, but monthly 
changes were quite volatile due to the Luna r New Year.  Export orders followed a similar 
pattern.  In March, import growth outpaced ex port growth, contributing to a moderate 
deterioration in the trade balance from a str ong February level.  Consumer price inflation 
moved down sharply in recent months, reaching less than half a percent in March on a 
twelve-month basis, largely owing to falling food prices.  Taiwan’s central bank raised 
interest rates slightly in la te March, citing concerns about potential pass through of higher 
IV-24 
oil prices to other consumer pr ices.  State-controlled fuel pr ices were raised 8 percent on 
average in April.

Korean  real GDP grew 5.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter aided by continued 
growth in private consumption and gains in stocks of inventories.  However, fixed 
investment fell somewhat following strong fourth-quarter growth.  Exports and imports 
both rose in the first quarter, and the tr ade surplus narrowed.  Industrial production 
growth moderated in the first quarter, and consumer and business confidence softened 
from their recent peaks, though they remained  elevated.  Consumer price inflation has 
been remarkably tame, rising 2 percent over the twelve months ended April, held down by falling food prices.

Incoming data from the ASEAN  countries suggest that economic activity moderated on 
average in the first quarter.  In Singapore, th e advance estimate of first-quarter real GDP 
growth (unofficial) fell to 1.2 percent from its blistering fourth-quarter rate, due mostly to 
a contraction in the vo latile biomedical sector.  In ever y country in the region, the most 
recent readings on industrial production were down, and in most of the region, trade 
balances are up relative to the fourth quarter. 
 
Consumer price inflation remained elevated in  the region, reflecting hi gher food prices in 
some countries as well as the effect of higher energy prices.  The recent increase in energy costs is partly the result of cuts in fuel subsidies, most notably in Indonesia and 
Malaysia. Citing inflationary pressures, the ce ntral banks of Thailand and Malaysia raised 
interest rates 25 basis points in April.

Indian  economic performance remained robust.   Industrial production stabilized in 
February after surging the pr evious month.  The closely wa tched wholesale price index 
has risen a relatively moderate 4.1 percent ove r the twelve months ended March.  India’s 
trade deficit widened to $42.5 billion in the first quarter due to a fall in exports and rise in 
imports, including a sharp rise in net oil im ports.  Last month, the government announced 
its intent to move toward allowing freer capit al movements over the next several years.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to a solid boun ceback in industrial activity, which had 
been soft during most of 2005.  In particular, automobile producti on and exports soared 
in the first quarter.  The strong performance in the auto sector contributed to a solid 
January performance in industrial production, which rose 1.2 percent from December, and production moved up further in February.  The surge in manufacturing exports led to 
IV-28 
a sizable improvement in Mexico’s trade balance in the first quarter.  On the domestic 
demand side, indicators suggest that in the fi rst quarter fixed invest ment remained strong, 
but consumer spending moderated a bit. 
 
Consumer price inflation rema ined well contained and is within the Bank of Mexico’s 
2 - 4 percent target range.  Twelve-month headline inflation was 3.4 percent in March, while core inflation was 3.1 percent.  Benign inflation prospects led the Bank of Mexico (BOM) to ease policy in April, the ninth eas ing since August.  As a result, the rate on 
28-day peso-denominated bills, a widely used measure of the monetary policy stance, has fallen from 9.6 percent in August to 7 percen t in early May.  However, the latest BOM 
announcement stated that there is no room fo r additional loosening of monetary policy.

In Brazil , recent data releases have been mixed.  Industrial output was up on average in 
January and February from its  average level in the fourth quarter.  On the other hand, 
February retail sales decreased by more than  had been expected.  Headline inflation 
continued to decline on a twelve-month basis and stood at 5.3 percent in March. 
 
In late March, Antonio Palocci resigned as Brazil's finance minister, and Guido Mantega, 
head of the national development bank, was a ppointed to the post.  Since taking office, 
IV-29 
Mantega has stressed that the government will adhere to its primary surplus target of 
4¼ percent of GDP, but many observers have expressed concerns over the sharp rise in 
government spending in recent months. 
 On April 17, the Brazilian central bank's mone tary policy co
 mmittee reduced its interest 
rate target ¾ percentage point  to 15.75 percent.  This is down 400 basis points since the 
current easing phase began last September.  The decision was expected and prompted 
little reaction in financial markets.  In mid-April, the government ex ercised its call option 
and bought back the remaining $6.6 billion in Brady bonds.

In Venezuela , anecdotal evidence suggests that ac tivity has continued to be strong, 
supported by expansionary fiscal and moneta ry policies and the hi gh price of oil.  
Inflation declined on a twelve-month basis to  about 11 percent in April, suppressed by 
price controls on food.  In early April, the Venezuelan government announced that it had 
completed 75 percent of its planned buyb ack of $3.9 billion in Brady bond debt and 
indicated that the remaining buybacks would occur by end-May.
