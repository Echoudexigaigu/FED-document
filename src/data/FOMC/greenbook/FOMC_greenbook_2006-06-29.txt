Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Economic activity appears to be increasing mo re slowly in the current quarter, both 
relative to its average pace over the course of last year and, more noticeably, relative to 
its elevated pace in the first quarter of this  year.  The expansion of household demand in 
particular has moderated: Gains in consum er spending in recent months have been 
considerably smaller than at  the turn of the year, while  housing demand and residential 
construction activity have cooled.  In contrast, the underlying pace of business spending 
has remained strong—well supported by its fundamentals.  The demand for labor decelerated in the spring, and available indica tors suggest a moderate pace of hiring in 
the near term.  Consumer price inflation has picked up in recent months, not only because 
of a sharp rise in energy prices but also becau se of more-rapid increases in core prices.   
 
Labor Market Developments 
The May labor market report provided furthe r evidence that the growth of labor demand 
has stepped down since the start of the y ear.  Employment on private nonfarm payrolls 
rose 67,000 in May, bringing the average of the past three months to 112,000; this 
reading compares with gains averaging about 170,000 per month in the preceding several 
months.  The recent slowing in hiring has b een most pronounced in retail trade, where 
many major categories of stores have experi enced net employment losses since the start 
of the year.  In addition, slower job gains have been evident in construction, and job 
losses have occurred in information services.  In contrast, establishm ents in professional 
and business services, nonbusiness services, a nd wholesale trade have  continued to add 
jobs at roughly the same pace as earlier in the year.    Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged down 0.1 hour in May to 33.8 hours, reversing April’s uptick.  Th e movement in the workweek prompted a 
similar swing in the aggreg ate hours of production or nons upervisory workers, which 
declined 0.2 percent la st month after a 0.4 percent increase in April.  On net, aggregate 
hours in May stood only 0.4 percent (not at an an nual rate) above their first-quarter level. 
 The slowdown in employment growth in recent months has coincided with a leveling off 
in the unemployment rate.  In particular, th e jobless rate has hove red in the neighborhood 
of 4.7 percent since January, although it r ounded down to 4.6 percent last month.  
Meanwhile, the labor force par ticipation rate held  steady in May at 66.1 percent for the 
fourth straight month.      The recent slowdown in employment growth appa rently is due more to a reduced pace of 
hiring than to a significant increase in separatio ns.  A bit of evidence in this regard comes 
from the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which showed a 
substantial drop in the hires rate  in April to its lowest level in a year and a half.  Although 
the JOLTS separations rate has moved up, on bala nce, in recent months, that increase

follows a sharp dip at the turn of the year, and the level in April was still below the 
average in 2005.  Moreover, other data suggest , at most, a small rise  in layoffs.  Initial 
claims for unemployment insurance averag ed 316,000 over the four weeks ending on 
June 10, a reading similar to that in late April.1  The number of job losers unemployed 
fewer than five weeks as a percentage of household employment has risen a bit since the 
start of the year but rema ins at a low level.  And layoff announcements tallied by 
Challenger, Gray, and Christmas have fallen, on net, in recent months.   
 
Recent indicators of business and household perceptions of the labor market generally point to moderate employment gains in comi ng months.  Both the th ird-quarter net hiring 
plans of participants in the Manpower survey and the hiring plans of small businesses as 
reported to the National Federa tion of Independent Business (N FIB) remain at favorable 
levels, although the NFIB index has been edging down since the start of the year.  
Similarly, household expectations of labor  market conditions as measured by the 
Conference Board ticked down in May but rema in at a relatively high level.  The one 
exception to this pattern is the series on expected labor market conditions from the 
Michigan survey, which has been  trending down for the past tw o years.  According to the 
preliminary reading, this inde x was unchanged in June.   
 
Other measures of labor market slack are ge nerally consistent with the low but stable 
unemployment rate.  After moving up sharply early  last fall, job openi ngs as a percentage 
of private employment have held fairly steady since October.  Similarly, households’ 
perceptions of job availability  have changed little this ye ar, while the share of small 
businesses with a hard-to-f ill position dropped back in May from a high April level, 
leaving it in line with the readings from the first quarter of the year.  These measures 
remain at levels that are consistent with  little or no slack in the labor market. 
 The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 4.4 percent in the first quart er after a 0.3 percent decrease in  the fourth quarter.  Over 
the four quarters ending in 2006:Q1, output  per hour increased 2.7 percent by our 
estimate—about ¼ percentage point below the pace recorded during the comparable period four quarters earlier.  According to the Bureau of La bor Statistics, output per hour 
in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose 3.7 percent both in the first quarter of 2006 and 
                                                
 
1 The level of claims was elevated in May by a partial government shutdown in Puerto Rico, but these 
claims are now largely out of the time frame for calculating the four-week moving average.

Industrial Production 
Industrial production (IP) surged  0.8 percent in April and th en edged down 0.1 percent in 
May; the limited available indicators thus far fo r June suggest that IP will rise moderately 
this month.  The choppy pattern primarily re flects changes in manufacturing output, 
which rose 0.7 percent in April before d eclining 0.1 percent in May.  On average, 
manufacturing production has increased at a m onthly rate of 0.3 percen t since the start of 
2006, down from the 0.4 percent average pace of  expansion from mid-2003 to the end of 
2005.   
 Manufacturing capacity utiliz ation stood at 80.5 percent in  May, about ¾ percentage 
point above its 1972-2005 average and about 1 percentage point below its most recent 
peak in April 2000.  The operating rate for indus tries at the crude stage of processing has 
snapped back from the effects of last year’s hurricanes and is now a little above its long-
run average.  The operating rate for industries at the primary and semifinished stages of 
processing has generally risen since 2003 and is also a little above its  long-run average.  
Capacity utilization for industries in the fini shed stage of processing has increased more 
quickly and is now well above its long-r un average.  Despite the above-average 
utilization rates at all stages of proce ssing, the Institute for Supply Management’s 
business surveys continue to report  very few items in short supply. 
 The output of energy expanded a solid 0.9 per cent in April and 0.7 percent in May, in 
part the result of continued rec overy from last year’s hurricane s.  In particular, crude oil 
extraction jumped 2½ percent in April before easing a bit in May.  As of early June, the 
amount of crude oil production capacity in the Gu lf of Mexico that remains shut in stood

at 4 percent, down from 7 percen t in March; this improvement is mainly the result of the 
resumption of operations at the Mars dr illing platform, which accounts for about 
2½ percent of U.S. production when in full operation.2  Natural gas extraction has inched 
forward since the beginning of the year, and only about 2 percent of U.S. production 
capacity in that industry remains shut in.  Within manufacturing, petroleum refining 
surged more than 4 percent in May, a result  of the completion of maintenance that had 
been delayed in the wake of the hurricanes, the partial return to operation of a major 
hurricane-idled refinery, and the return to operations of facilities that were being 
converted to produce ethanol-ready gasoline.3  Meanwhile, electricity generation rose 
1.8 percent in April and dropped back 0.2 per cent in May as temperatures moved from 
unusually warm in April to more seasonabl e last month.  Available weekly-frequency 
data point to a moderate gain in electricity production this month a nd to more substantial 
gains in crude oil and refinery output.  Total motor vehicle assemblies slipped about 400,000 units in May to an annual rate of 
11.3 million units; as a result, the IP index for motor vehicles declined 1.3 percent last 
month after falling a littl e in April.  Assemblies are schedul ed to rise to 11.5 million units 
for June and to 11.8 million units for the third quarter as a whole.  Elsewhere in 
transportation, aircraft produc tion increased a robust 0.9 percent per month, on average, 
from January to April but edged down 0.2 percent in May, as a modest gain in commercial aircraft output was more than offset by a continued decline in military 
aircraft production.  
 In the high-tech sector, production has increase d at a relatively subdued rate so far this 
year.  The slowing in output growth from la st year’s pace primarily reflects a sharp 
deceleration in the production of semiconductors  from a 30 percent rise last year to a 
2½ percent annual rate of d ecline so far in 2006.  In pa rticular, the production of 
microprocessors (MPUs), the central logi c semiconductor chip in computers, has 
decelerated sharply since the beginning of 2006 in response to a slowing in the sales and  
                                                
 
2 The Mars platform is expected to be running  at full capacity by the end of June.     
3 Three hurricane-idled refineries have not yet return ed to full operation.  The BP Texas City refinery, 
accounting for 3 percent of U.S. refine ry capacity, restarted about one-fourt h of its operation in April.  The 
Murphy Meraux refinery (about 1 percent of U.S. capacity) is slated to resume operation by the end of 
June.  Plans to restart the Belle Chasse refinery (1½ percent of U.S. capacity) have not been made public. 
Ethanol-ready gasoline accounts for about 30 percent of  U.S. gasoline production.  Nearly all refiners 
have switched to using an ethanol-based formula this year for their reformulated gasoline.

production of computers.4  In contrast, the production of  non-MPU chips accelerated in 
April and May, as worldwide sales of cell phones, a major demand driver for non-MPU 
chips, surged in the first quarter.  In  addition, the producti on of communications 
equipment in the United States has risen sharply since mid-2005, in part to meet demands from telecommunications service providers for equipment to expand network capacity so that it can accommodate the de livery of a new generation of services over the Internet 
and cell phones.
5  The Semiconductor Industry Asso ciation’s recently updated forecast 
for worldwide semiconductor sales implies a subs tantial acceleration in the second half of 
2006, and the rising bookings for semiconducto r manufacturing equipment reported by 
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials In ternational suggest that semiconductor 
producers are adding capacity to meet this projected demand. 
 Apart from the sectors that produce energy, moto r vehicles and parts, aircraft, and high 
tech, almost all major market groups posted solid output gains in March and April before leveling off or retreating a bit in May.  The production of constr uction supplies posted a 
moderate gain in April and then dipped 0.6 percent in May, partly because of an 
unwinding of a first-quarter boost from warm weather; in addition, recent strength in 
segments such as concrete and architectural and structural steel s uggests a possible shift 
in the composition of output toward nonres idential constructi on.  The production of 
business equipment has climbed rapidly, on balance, in recent months; output rose about 2 percent in April, having been boosted by a pickup in the output  of construction and 
farm machinery equipment, and then declin ed a little in May.  The index for business 
equipment now stands 8 percen t above its year-ago level. 
 Among the available near-term indicators, th e Institute for Supply Management’s new 
orders diffusion index stepped down noticeably in May to a level consistent with moderate gains in manufacturing output.  Howeve r, the June readings on new orders from 
the New York and Philadelphia Fed surveys indicate larger gains.  
 
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of light vehicles fell to an annual  rate of 16.0 million units in May, significantly 
below the average pace of sales in the first four  months of the year.   
                                                
 
4 Industry reports have characterized the slowing in computer sales as a pause in anticipation of 
product releases scheduled for the second half of this year.  In particular, several manufacturers will release 
a new generation of high-end servers in the second half of 2006, and PC manu facturers are slated to 
produce machines based on improved dual-core Intel MPUs.  In addition, the notable decline in Intel’s 
share of world MPU production over the past year has damped domestic semiconductor output.  Intel primarily produces its MPUs in the United States, while most MPU production by AMD—Intel’s primary rival in the MPU segment—is in Germany. 
5 Public and private spending to rebuild infrastructure damaged in the 2006 hurricane season and to 
improve communications among first responders has provided additional impetus to the industry.

6  The indicators for 
light vehicle sales in June are mixed: 
 
 in 
addition, sales in the first twenty days of J une for the three major Japanese automakers 
weakened somewhat. 
  According to the University of Michigan Surv ey of Consumer Attit udes, the percentage 
of households reporting that it was a bad time to buy a car because of high gasoline prices has trended up in recent years and last month jumped to its highest level since the late 
1970s; this reading remained elevated in th e preliminary survey for June, although it was 
down somewhat from May.  In line with conc erns over gasoline prices, the market share 
of light trucks has flattened out after in creasing steadily throughout the 1990s, and the 
average fuel economy of new vehicles sold has turned up over the past few years.  In the 
most recent data, the market share of light  trucks dropped further in May, and the six-
month moving average of fuel economy moved up slightly.   
 
Consumer Spending 
Real consumer spending is on track to decele rate noticeably in the current quarter after 
increasing at a robust annual rate of 5¼ percen t in the first quarter.  In addition to a 
decline in real outlays for motor vehicles in April and May from an elevated first-quarter 
level, the rate of increase in real expe nditures for other goods has slowed in recent 
months as well.  In contrast, real outlays for total PCE servic es have trended up in recent 
months after a sizable weathe r-induced drop in outlays for en ergy services early in the 
year.   
 After posting outsized gains around the turn of  the year, real spending on goods other 
than motor vehicles declined in February and has edged up only slightly in subsequent 
months.  In nominal terms, spending at reta ilers other than building material and supply 
outlets and motor vehicle dealers has increa sed noticeably in recent months, but those 
increases largely reflected higher prices.  Give n the changes in consumer prices in May, 
we estimate that real spending declined last month in the durables category that includes 
home furnishings—consistent with the coo ling off of the housing market—and increased 
modestly for other goods excluding energy.  Real purchases of gasoline fell last month,  
                                                
 
6 In the first week of June, both Ford and General Motors introduced debit cards guaranteeing a low 
price of gasoline.  However, J.D. Power and Associates reports that the take-up of these cards has been 
weak so far, and it excludes them from its measure of  recent incentives.

possibly the result of households’ reaction to  high energy prices.  So far in June, 
anecdotal reports from retailer s have been relatively upbeat. 
 
The recent softness in consumer expenditure s has been accompanied by a moderation in 
the fundamental determinants of spending.  Data from unemployment insurance tax 
records suggest that nominal wa ges and salaries were consider ably weaker in the fourth 
quarter than previously estimated, and even with the solid gains in wages and salaries 
now estimated for the first four months of  this year, rising consumer prices—driven 
importantly by higher prices for gasoline—have held down the growth of real disposable 
income.  Higher interest rates have also lik ely been restraining spending, and the stock 
market has slipped of late.  Still, the stock ma rket gains of the past couple of years, along 
with ongoing increases in home prices, kept the wealth-to-inco me ratio in the first quarter 
well above its historical aver age.  Meanwhile, consumer sentiment dipped in May but 
rebounded some in early June.   
 Real disposable personal income expanded at a pace somewhat slower than that of 
consumer outlays, and the personal saving rate  continued to move down; the April rate 
stood at -1.6 percent, its most recent reading.

Housing Markets 
Residential construction activity has modera ted noticeably over the past few months, 
though it remains at a historical ly high level.  Single-family starts in April and May 
averaged an annual rate of 1.57 million un its, well below the r ecord-setting pace in 
January and February.  Although a good portion of the drop since February seems to be 
the result of starts th at were pulled forward by favorable  weather conditions early in the 
year, the evidence also suggests that a slow ing in the underlying pace of single-family 
housing construction is under way.  In particular , the level of adjusted permit issuance in 
the single-family sector—more reliable than starts as an indicator of the underlying pace 
of housing construction—has trended down sin ce last September, and the backlog of 
unused permits has dropped sharply after peaking la te last year.8  In the multifamily 
sector, starts in May were at an annual  rate of 371,000 units—we ll within the typical 
range seen since 1995. 
 
The pace of home sales has also been slowi ng, on balance, for some time now.  Sales of 
existing single-family homes in April were at an annual rate of 5.92 million units, down  
                                                 
7 All else being equal, we expect th e saving rate to be boosted ¾ percen tage point by this year’s annual 
retail sales revision, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis will incorporate into the national income and 
product accounts this summer.  This revision does not imply a different contour of the saving rate over the 
past several months, though it does suggest a somewhat flatter path of the rate in recent years. 
8 Adjusted permits equal permit issuance plus total starts outside of permit-issuing areas.

6½ percent from their peak in June 2005.  Ne w home sales have regained some ground in 
recent months after having dipped sharply in Fe bruary, but the pace of sales in April was 
still 12½ percent below the r ecord high posted in July of  last year.   
 
 
 
   
Near-term indicators suggest that activity in housing markets will continue to ease in the 
months ahead.  Inventories of both new and existing homes have been trending up relative to sales for some time now, and pe nding home sales—a l eading indicator of 
existing home sales—have slid further in r ecent months.  In addition, the Michigan index 
of homebuying attitudes has moved down consid erably over the past year and is quite 
low relative to the readings of a couple of years ago.  Mo reover, higher mortgage rates 
should continue to damp housing demand in th e months ahead.  Since home sales peaked 
about a year ago, the average rate for thirty -year fixed-rate mortgages has risen a little 
more than 1 percentage point, while the average rate for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages has climbed nearly 1½ percentage points.  House-price appreciation has slowed from the elevated rates seen last year, but the most 
reliable measures suggest that this decelerat ion has been modest thus far.  The purchase-
only version of the price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)—which controls for differences in quality by tracking repeat sales of  houses over time—rose at an annual rate of 7¼ percent in the first 
quarter, the smallest increase si nce the fourth quarter of 2001.   Although we think that the 
OFHEO index is, on balance, the most reliabl e overall gauge of house-price appreciation, 
it does not fully reflect the highest and lowe st ends of the market because it excludes 
sales financed using jumbo mortgages and mortgages backed by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and the Federal Housing Ad ministration.  In comparison, the rate of 
appreciation in the Case-Shiller repeat-sale price index—which includes such purchases but is confined to sales in ten large U.S. cities—has moved down more noticeably over the past year, although it remains a ppreciably above the OFHEO measure.
9  The constant-
quality price index for new homes—the most reliable measure of quality-adjusted price appreciation in the new home market—rose 6 percent over the f our quarters ending in 
2006:Q1, its smallest year-over-year increase in  two years.  More up-to-date measures of 
house-price increases, which have broad pric e coverage but are not quality adjusted, 
suggest steeper declines.  The average price of existing homes in April was up only 3¾ percent from the level of twelve months earlier, a steep drop-off from its rise of

Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington.

8¾ percent in January.  The rate of increase in the average price of new homes has also 
been low for the past few months.10   
 
Equipment and Software   
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) appears on track for a modest gain in 
the second quarter after surg ing 13¾ percent in the first quarter.  However, smoothing 
through some sharp swings in spending on motor vehicles and communications 
equipment, it appears that E&S spending has maintained a solid underlying pace of expansion so far this year.      The fundamental determinants of E&S sp ending have remained supportive of ongoing 
spending gains:  Business output has conti nued to expand, firms remain flush with cash, 
and ongoing declines in relative prices have further reduced the cost of capital (albeit to a 
lesser extent than earlier th is decade).  In addition, both the capital spending diffusion 
index derived from a survey of the National Association of Business Economists and the 
Philadelphia Fed survey point to continued growth in real  outlays for new equipment. 
 Real outlays on transportation equipment jumped  at an annual rate of 30 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, as  truck sales surged and domes tic expenditures on aircraft 
stepped up from their very low fourth-quart er level.  The average pace of sales of 
medium and heavy trucks in April and May fell below the first-quarter level but remained well above the average for the past five y ears.  Demand for medi um and heavy trucks 
reportedly has been pulled forward in advan ce of new Environmental Protection Agency 
regulations on engines scheduled to take effect in 2007, and industry analysts indicate 
that orders already in hand ar e sufficient to fully use availa ble production capacity for the 
rest of 2006. 
  Total civilian aircraft sh ipments in April and Boeing 
deliveries in May point to a fu rther rise in the current quarter, while the available trade 
data imply that net exports of aircraft have  declined.  As a result, we estimate that 
domestic outlays on aircraft have conti nued to expand in the current quarter.  
 Real outlays on high-tech equipment and softwa re surged at an annual rate of 23 percent 
in the first quarter, an increase led by a ju mp of 77 percent in ou tlays on communications 
equipment.  This exceptional pace of growth  likely reflects rapid rates of spending by 
telecommunications service pr oviders on fiber-optic networ ks, replacement spending on 
communications infrastructure destroyed in last year’s hurrican es, and some outdoor 
installation that, because of the mild winter, was brought fo rward from the spring.  In  
                                                
 
10 The interpretation of the recent deceleration in this series is cl ouded by the fact that sampling 
procedures were revised in 2005.

April, nominal shipments of communicati ons equipment posted another strong gain, 
while nominal orders, continuing their erra tic pattern, dropped sharply.  Respondents to 
the quarterly tech poll in April’s CIO Magazine  reported that they plan to increase 
spending on communications equipment over the next twelve months.  Taken together, 
these data and indicators suggest that the level of spending on communications 
equipment has remained robust during the current quarter, though the pace of its 
expansion has no doubt mode rated significantly from the first quarter.   
 
In contrast, demand for computers and software has been relatively weak in real terms so 
far this year.  Real outlays on computers and peripherals increased at  an annual rate of 
15½ percent in the first quarter—a modest  pace for this category of spending—and 
software spending expanded at a similarl y restrained 5¾ percent rate.  Likewise, 
shipments of computers rose only a little in  April, and second-qua rter revenue-guidance 
statements issued by various major software venders point to a moderate pace of business spending in the current quarter.  According to  industry analysts, com puter and peripheral 
spending in the first half of this year ha s likely been postponed in  anticipation of the 
release of several key hardware and software  products later in the year and in early 
2007—most notably, new lines of faster and more-energy-efficient servers and 
significantly enhanced dual-core processor chips.  Real outlays for equipment outside of the high-tech and transpor tation categories were 
flat in the first quarter after rising sharply at the end of last  year.  Notably, spending on 
industrial equipment fell modestly last quart er after rising 13½ per cent in the fourth 
quarter.  However, the sharp run-up in recent  months in unfilled orders for equipment 
outside of the high-tech and transportation cat egories points to a very strong rate of 
spending growth in the coming months.   
 
Nonresidential Construction   
Outlays for the construction of nonresidential buildings have picked  up noticeably so far 
this year.  Expenditures on ma nufacturing structures have st rengthened considerably over 
the past two quarters despite lit tle change in vacancy rates in  this sector.  The “other” 
category—which includes construction outlays on buildings for health care, lodging, and 
education—has also registered strong growth of late, while spending on office 
construction has gained some traction as vacancy  rates in this sector  continue to drift 
down.  By contrast, the commercial category has posted an uneven spending pattern in 
recent months despite vacancy rates in this sect or that remain low by historical standards.  
Forward-looking indicators suggest that out lays for nonresidential building construction 
will continue to rise over the next few quarters, but at a more subdued pace.  The four-
month moving average of the architectural billings index—a new diffusion index from 
the American Institute of Architects that m easures whether billings by architectural firms 
are increasing or decreasing—ha s slipped in recent months but remains at a relatively

favorable level.11  This index is well correlated with  nominal expenditure growth in the 
nonresidential construction sector and has a lead of about two quarters. 
 
Outlays on drilling and mining structures have  continued to climb in response to high 
projected energy prices.  In the first quarter, real spending in th is sector rose at an annual 
rate of 7¼ percent after posti ng a double-digit gain in 2005.  The number of rigs drilling 
for natural gas and petroleum has recently move d up at a good clip after a lull early this 
year; this rise suggests that the growth in outla ys in this sector will pick up again in the 
current quarter. 
 
Business Inventories  
The real value of manufacturing and trade i nventories outside of the motor vehicles 
sector increased at an annual rate of $25 billion in the firs t quarter, about double the pace 
of accumulation seen over the second half of  last year.  More recently, the book value of 
inventories is reported to have increased at a $70 billion rate in Ap ril; we estimate that 
just over one-half of this increase repres ents an accumulation in real stocks.   
 
Since the turn of the year, the ratio of book- value inventories to sales has held steady 
after falling noticeably last year.  Informa tion from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory 
system also suggests that—excluding moto r vehicles and parts—months’ supply has 
changed little this year afte r declining rapidly toward the end of last year.  Except for 
paper products, inventories appear to be well aligned with dema nd.  Similarly, business 
surveys suggest that firms view the current le vel of their customers’ inventories as being 
within a comfortable range.    
Federal Government 
The federal budget deficit narrowed further in April and May.  Accord ing to the Monthly 
Treasury Statement, the federal government recorded a surplus of $76 billion over the 
past two months, compared with a $22 billion surplus in the same pe riod last year.  Over 
the twelve months ending in May, the defi cit was $273 billion, $66 billion smaller than 
the deficit over the same period a year ago.  The improvement in the federal budget balan ce has resulted from strong inflows of tax 
receipts, which have outpaced the growth in nominal income so far this year.  After adjusting for payment-timing shifts, total re ceipts were 16 percent higher in April and 
May than in the comparable period last year.  Individual tax payments were up 
significantly in April and May, with particular  strength in nonwithhe ld payments—which  
                                                
 
11 First published last fall, the architectural billings index includes billings for both nonresidential and 
residential construction projects, but the overwhelming majority of these projects (about 88 percent) are 
nonresidential.

are mostly final payments on last year’s indi vidual tax liability.  Corporate tax payments 
were a robust 25 percent higher in  April and May than a year earlier.  Data from Daily 
Treasury Statements for June show an increase  of about 15 percent in  corporate quarterly 
payments of estimated tax liability re lative to last year’s level.   
 
Federal outlays also have increased at a fa ster pace than nominal income over the past 
year, but at a slower pace than receipts.  Outlays in the past two months, adjusted for 
payment-timing shifts, were 10 percent higher than during the same period last year.  
Defense spending in April and May was 9½ pe rcent higher than the year-ago level.  
Medicare spending in the past  two months was 19½ percent above its year-ago level and 
has been boosted significantly by payments for the new Part D prescription drug benefit.  
Medicaid spending was about 5 pe rcent lower in April and May th an it was last year; this 
decline reflects the shift to Medicare of dr ug spending for elderly Medicaid patients as 
well as an apparent overall decelerat ion in underlying Medicaid spending. 
 
The Congress has passed two pieces of legi slation that affect the budget.  The tax 
reconciliation bill enacted in  May is estimated to redu ce revenues by about $70 billion 
over the next five years.  This legislation extended relief from the alternative minimum 
tax through 2006 for many individu als and delayed the expirati on of the reduced tax rates 
on capital gains and dividends from 2008 to 2010.  The Congress also passed a 
supplemental appropriations bill that provide s about $70 billion in additional funding for 
activities related to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, $20 bi llion for additional hurricane 
disaster relief, about $2½ billion for avian fl u preparedness, and $2 billion for increased 
border patrols.  Finally, in response to recen t court rulings, the Treasury has decided to 
eliminate the 3 percent excise tax on l ong-distance telephone service beginning in 
August, which will likely reduce revenues by ab out $5 billion per year.  In addition, the 
Treasury will refund an estimated $13 billion in  excise tax payments made by individuals 
and businesses over the past three years; these refunds will take place during the tax 
refund season in 2007.    
State and Local Government Sector 
Real purchases by state and local governments have risen sluggishly over the past several 
years, and the recent monthly data suggest a continuation of this trend.  Employment rose 
about 10,000 per month in April a nd May, a rate of increase simila r to that of the past two 
quarters.  As has been the case for some time, most of the hiring was done by local 
governments.  Similarly, real construction is estimated to ha ve posted a small increase in 
the first quarter after little change, on bala nce, in 2005.  In April,  construction spending 
was 0.7 percent above the averag e level in the first quarter in nominal terms, but we 
estimate that increases in the prices of construction-related materials more than accounted 
for this rise.

Recently, states have reported surprisingl y strong tax collections.  The National 
Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) expects that  state revenues for the 2006 
fiscal year, which ends on J une 30 for forty-six states, wi ll be 3½ percent higher than 
anticipated by states at the time budgets were enacted.  The revenue su rprise is the result 
of stronger-than-expected personal and cor porate income tax receipts.  NASBO also 
reported that, despite significant increases in nominal spending, state year-end balances 
are expected to equal 8 percent of general fund expenditures, a figur e significantly above 
the 5 percent threshold generally considered to constitute adequate fiscal reserves.12  In 
addition, the Rockefeller Institute’s State Revenue Report suggests that revenues 
increased briskly in most states over the ye ar ending in the first quarter.  And for the 
second quarter, the available evidence point s to unusually strong personal income tax 
collections.13  
 
Prices  
Rates of price inflation have picked up in recent months.  The overall CPI rose 
0.4 percent in May and was boosted for a thir d straight month by a sharp increase in 
energy prices.  Moreover, the CPI for items  excluding food and energy posted its third 
consecutive increase of 0.3 percent after average increases of 0.2 percent per month 
during the preceding three months.  On the basis of these CPI data, we estimate that core 
PCE prices rose about 0.3 percent last month, putting the twelve-month change in that measure at 2.2 percent in May, a touch higher than the increase over the previous twelve-
month period.  However, we estimate that co re PCE prices rose at a much more rapid 
annual rate of 3.4 percent over th e three months ending in May. 
 
Consumer food prices have decelerated marked ly since January because of slower price 
increases for food away from home and because  of a reversal of earlier run-ups in the 
prices of fruits and vegetables.  Altho ugh strong demand has boosted prices for wheat 
and corn recently, higher grain prices have as yet had little effect on retail prices of food; 
furthermore, ample supplies of livestock and poultry have helped to moderate increases 
in consumer prices for meat and poultry products. 
 The jump in consumer energy prices in May extended the pattern of  exceptionally steep 
increases seen in the preceding few months.  Over the first five months of the year, we 
estimate that the index of PCE energy prices  rose at an annual rate in excess of 
30 percent, compared with the 17 percent incr ease posted over the twel ve months of both 
2004 and 2005.   
                                                
 
12 General fund expenditures constitute 43 percent of total state expenditures. 
13 For example, California reported that final payments of personal income tax liabilities were 
40 percent above the previous year.  More broadly, state personal income tax payments are correlated with 
federal income tax payments, which we re unusually strong this spring.

Almost all of the increase in PCE energy pri ces since the beginning of this year reflects 
higher prices of petroleum-based products.  Most notably, the index for consumer 
gasoline prices increased an estimated 4.9 percent in May and has risen more than 
20 percent (not at an annual ra te) so far this year.  For J une, however, preliminary survey 
data suggest little change in re tail gasoline prices.  The recent rise in retail gasoline prices 
is due in roughly equal measure to higher cr ude oil costs and to higher margins between 
retail and crude prices.  This  unusually wide gap does not re flect an unusual shortfall in 
gasoline supplies; gasoline inventories seem typical for the season.  Rather, it reflects 
both the extra cost of produc ing and distributing reformul ated gasoline with ethanol 
(relative to gasoline with MTBE, which was in common use before May) and concerns 
about possible shortfalls in ethanol supplies this summer.14    
 
In marked contrast with gasoline, a surprisingl y persistent glut of natural gas supplies has 
caused spot prices of natural gas to plunge si nce the beginning of the year, a full reversal 
of last autumn’s sharp increases.  This collap se of spot prices ha s led to a substantial 
downturn in consumer prices for natural gas, which have declined nearly 15 percent since 
January.    
 
The extent to which the pass- through of higher petroleum pr ices has contributed to the 
recent pickup in core consumer price inflat ion is difficult to estimate.  However, many 
businesses clearly are experiencing higher cost s, and energy prices have shown through 
to PPIs for a variety of energy-intensiv e intermediate goods— including industrial 
chemicals, asphalt, plastics, and fertili zers—and intermediate services such as 
transportation.  Among finished core consumer goods and services, energy constitutes an 
especially large fraction of input  costs for transportation services  such as airline travel, in 
which both CPI and PCE prices (which are m easured independently and differently) have 
risen sharply over the past twelve months.  An acceleration in housing rents—both tenant -occupied and especially owner-occupied—
has also contributed significantly to the in crease in core inflation in recent months 
(particularly for the CPI, in which the weight  of housing is higher than in the PCE price 
index).  Tenants’ rents are likely inversely related to the affordability of owner-occupied 
housing, and the deterioration of housing afford ability (due to risi ng house prices and  
                                                
 
14 Strong demand has pushed spot prices of ethanol sharply higher in recent months.  For July delivery, 
ethanol is about $2 per gallon more expensive than gasoline at the point of production, which—because 
ethanol accounts for one-tenth of the new reformulated gasoline—adds about 20 cents per gallon to the 
retail cost of reformulated gasoline; in addition, tran sport and blending costs are higher for gasoline-ethanol 
mixes than for conventional or MTBE-based gasoline.  However, ethanol production capacity is expanding 
rapidly, and futures prices suggest a marked do wnturn in ethanol prices over the coming year.

mortgage rates) may be a factor c ontributing to the acceleration in rents.15  Although the 
CPI for owners’ equivalent rent is derive d from quotes on tenants’ rents, owners’ 
equivalent rent has increased s ubstantially more than tenants’ rent in recent months.  This 
difference apparently reflects st eeper rent increases for rent al units in predominantly  
owner-occupied neighborhoods, as these obtain a larger weight in owners’ equivalent 
rent.16   
 
Although faster increases for the rent categor ies have been especially pronounced, the 
recent acceleration in core PCE prices has been evident in goods prices as well, with 
prices of apparel and a vari ety of other nondurable goods posting faster increases so far 
this year than they did in 2005.  In additi on, the nonmarket component of the PCE price 
index has increased at an annual rate of more  than 4 percent during the first four months 
of this year after rising 3¼  percent in 2005.  Within this  category, increases in the 
imputed index for financial services provided w ithout a specific fee ha ve been especially 
noteworthy. 
 After rising in April and May, in flation expectations have rece ntly eased a little as energy 
prices have leveled off.  The Michigan Surv ey Research Center’s preliminary June figure 
for median one-year inflati on expectations moved down 0.6 percentage point, to 
3.4 percent, and median five- to ten-year e xpectations fell 0.2 percentage point, to 
3.0 percent.  As of June 16, inflation comp ensation implied by rate spreads on nominal 
and CPI-indexed Treasury bonds was about 2½ percent for both five- and ten-year 
maturities.  Both are down about 10 basis points since the May Greenbook. 
 
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for co re intermediate materials rose 1.1 percent in 
May—the largest increase since last October.   Prices for core crude materials rose 
6.2 percent in May after sizable  increases earlier in the ye ar; like the earlier increases, 
May’s jump reflected large increases in prices  for commodities, especially metals.  Since 
the PPI pricing date in mid-May, prices fo r non-energy commodities have softened.  In 
particular, the Journal of Co mmerce metals index now sta nds 8½ percent below its level 
in mid-May, reflecting widespread price dec lines among industrial metals.  Meanwhile, 
spot prices of construction materials such as lumber, plywood, and oriented strand board 
turned down sharply during May but have flattened out more recently. 
                                                
 
15 The National Association of Realtors’ measure of  housing affordability moved down substantially 
over the course of 2005 and has con tinued to decline through April of th is year (the most recent reading). 
16 Because some rents include utilities costs, and owne rs’ equivalent rent is co nceptually a “pure rent” 
measure, the BLS subtracts utility costs from these quotes before incorporating them into owners’ 
equivalent rent.  However, this utilities adjustment appears to explain only a small part of the rising 
discrepancy between increases in owners’ equivalent rent and tenants’ rent over the past several months.

Labor Costs 
The sharp downward revision to private wages a nd salaries in the four th quarter of last 
year led to a similar revision to hourly compensation.17  In particular, compensation per 
hour in the nonfarm business sector is now repor ted to have declined at an annual rate of 
0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the previously reported estimate of a 
2.7 percent increase.  The first-quarter increas e was also revised down a bit; over the year 
ending in the first quarter, compensation per hour is now estimated to have risen only 
2.7 percent.  For the moment, this revised comp ensation estimate is in line with the four-
quarter rise in hourly compen sation reported in the employ ment cost index (ECI).  
However, in contrast to the experience with the ECI, which has been posting subdued 
increases for some time, this small increase in nonfarm compensation per hour follows an 
especially large jump in the preceding year that likely refl ected a surge in stock-option 
exercises and bonuses.   
 The downward revision to fourth-quarter hourly compensation does not necessarily 
portend any such revision to this year’s data.
18  We currently estimate that nonfarm 
compensation per hour increased at an annual ra te of about 5 percent in the first quarter, 
and the latest readings on average hourly  earnings of production or nonsupervisory 
workers point to a similar increase this quart er.  Average hourly earnings were little 
changed in May after a large rise in April, and, in general, average hourly earnings have 
accelerated over the past year.  
                                                 
17 As noted earlier, this downward revision reflected  the incorporation of new information on wages 
and salaries from unemploym ent insurance tax records. 
18 Revisions to private wages and salaries exhibit no apparent serial correlation.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
The expected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the intermeeting period, 
particularly for the near term, as market  participants interpreted Federal Reserve 
communications and higher-than- anticipated readings on core consumer price inflation as 
pointing to further tightening of monetary po licy.  Data on real activity generally fell 
short of market expectations over the in termeeting period.  The resulting perceived 
reduction in economic momentum, along with ex pectations of tighter monetary policy, 
led investors to reduce the inflation comp ensation built into market yields.  Although 
near-term indicators of corporate credit quality remained quite favorable, spreads on corporate bonds widened a bit and equ ity prices dropped appreciably over the 
intermeeting period, likely reflecting the less favorable prospects for economic growth 
and some increase in risk premiums.  Rapid growth of household mortgage debt earlier 
this year pushed the financia l obligations ratio higher, but  household delinquency rates 
continued to be low.  
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Although the decision at the May FOMC meeting to increase the target federal funds rate 
25 basis points was anticipated, market participants marked up the expected path of policy, particularly in the near  term, as investors reportedl y focused on the indication of 
upside risks to inflation in the accompanying statement.  FOMC communications over 
the intermeeting period, including speeches by policymakers and the minutes of the May 
meeting, were also interpreted as signaling an increased probabil ity of further policy 
tightening.  Market participants  are now virtually certain of  a 25 basis point increase at 
the June FOMC meeting and place better-th an-even odds on a further tightening in 
August.  The expected federal funds rate  at the end of 2006 climbed about 25 basis 
points, to 5.4 percent, wh ile the expected policy path  at the end of 2007 moved up 
20 basis points to 5.2 percent.  Despite increas ed volatility in other markets, uncertainty 
about the future path of policy, as inferred fr om Eurodollar-implied vo latilities, was little 
changed over the in termeeting period. 
 In line with the upward revision to the expected policy path in the near term, two-year 
Treasury yields rose about 20 basis po ints over the interm eeting period.  The 
configuration of rate changes in the Treasury market suggests that investors have revised 
up their outlook for real interest rates and believe that this re straint will keep inflation in 
check.  Nominal ten-year Treasury yields we re little changed, wh ile those on ten-year 
indexed notes were up about 15 basis points.  Despite higher-than-expected core CPI data

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad equity indexes were weighed down by tighter expected monetary policy, weaker-
than-anticipated economic data, and an apparent pullback from  risk-taking by investors.  
Equity-market indexes sank 6 to 13 percen t, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
reversing roughly all the gains that had been registered earlier this  year.  The fall in 
equity prices left the forward earnings-price ratio a bit higher, and the gap between this 
ratio and the long-run real Treasury yiel d—a rough measure of the equity premium—
widened slightly over the intermeeting period.  Sh are prices fell the most  in the cyclically 
sensitive sectors that had logged the largest gains in the previous months, including basic 
materials producers and small-cap firms.  Afte r hovering at very low levels earlier in the 
year, implied volatility on the S&P 500 increa sed sharply, a move consistent with greater 
uncertainty about the outlook.    Price movements for corporate bonds were le ss pronounced, as concern over near-term 
credit risk has apparently remained s ubdued.  Although risk spreads on BBB corporate 
bonds widened about 15 basis points over th e intermeeting period and spreads on high-
yield bonds moved up about 35 ba sis points, these spreads re main relatively low.  The 
increases were generally larger  in the portion of the forward curve more than five years 
ahead, which suggests that the rise in spr eads largely reflects an increase in risk 
premiums rather than the per ception of heightened default ri sk (which would tend to be 
concentrated in the nearer-dat ed part of the curve).  In the commercial paper market, the 
thirty-day quality spread remained low.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
In the first quarter, aggregate earnings per share for the S&P 500 increased 15 percent 
from its year-earlier level.  The increase in NIPA profits over the same period came in at 
25 percent, having been boosted by particul arly large gains among smaller firms.  
Analysts revised up their year-ahead ear nings expectations through mid-May on the 
broadly positive news in th e first-quarter earnings repor ts.  Revisions to S&P 500 
earnings forecasts so far in June have been slightly positive on balance.    Robust earnings continue to sustain strong cor porate balance sheets.  Corporate leverage 
has remained very low, and liquidity has stay ed quite high; the first-quarter data showed 
only small reversals in these trends.  Meanwh ile, downgrades of bond ratings subsided in

April and May from their slightly elevated first-quarter pace, and the six-month trailing 
bond default rate remained low.  Expected year-ahead defaults, as measured by Moody’s 
KMV, continued to drift down in May, though th e recent fall in stock prices and rise in 
equity market volatility portend an uptick in the June reading.  S till, the level should 
remain low, an indication that the strength in aggregate credit quality is viewed as likely 
to persist over the near term.    
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms has remained brisk, as both investment-grade 
and speculative-grade companies continue to  view financing condi tions as favorable.  
C&I loans have risen smartly so far in th e second quarter, while commercial paper 
outstanding has been about flat on balance.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial 
corporations through mid-June has nearly ma intained its robust first-quarter pace. 
  Gross public equity issuance resumed a moderate  pace in May and the first half of June, 
after a lull in April.  Share repurchases have  been supported by robust earnings and liquid 
balance sheets, while cash merger s have continued to be driven in large part by leveraged 
buyout activity.  Recent data suggest that equity  retirements associated with cash mergers 
have come down a bit from their blistering first-quarter pace, but the level of merger 
activity remains high.  
Commercial Real Estate  
Commercial mortgage borrowi ng was strong again in the fi rst quarter, reaching a level 
16 percent above its year-ear lier reading.  The issuance calendar for commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) suggests continued strength in borrowing in the 
second quarter despite a rise in  commercial mortgage interest  rates in recent months to 
their highest levels in severa l years.  Spreads of rates on investment-grade CMBS over 
those on comparable-maturity Treasuries have  increased slightly in recent weeks but 
remain quite narrow.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages and CMBS are very 
low by historical standards, and a decline in vacancy rates and some firming in rents in 
the current quarter indicate continued improvement in the fundamentals of the 
commercial real estate market.    
Household Finance  
Household mortgage debt expa nded rapidly in the first quart er, evidently propelled by 
further substantial gains in house prices a nd related strength in  cash-out refinancing 
activity.  Although little hard data are in hand concerning mortgage borrowing in the

second quarter, increases in mortgage rates in recent months should be a moderating 
influence.  Meanwhile, consumer credit was on ly modestly above its year-earlier level in 
April, as households apparent ly continued to shift toward mortgage debt as a means of 
holding down debt service payments through lo wer interest rates and longer amortization 
schedules.   Even with the shift toward lower-cost mortgage debt, the financial obligations ratio moved up in the first quarter to a level just above the t op of its historical range.  
However, delinquency rates on credit cards, auto  loans, and prime residential mortgages 
have stayed low in recent months, which s uggests little or no deteri oration in underlying 
credit quality for the majority of house holds.  Delinquencies on subprime mortgages 
edged down in the first quarter but remain so mewhat higher than they were a year ago, 
even after allowing for the delinquenci es induced by last  fall’s hurricanes. 
 Bankruptcy filings have been low since th eir spike preceding the implementation of 
reform in mid-October.  The low levels are cons istent with the view that last fall’s surge 
represented an acceleration of planned fili ngs to avoid the higher costs and more-
stringent standards imposed by the reform.  However, evidence is mounting that the 
lower filing numbers may represent more than just changes in timing.  In the past three 
months, new filings have ranged between  9,000 and 13,000 per week (with no apparent 
trend), compared with about 25,000 to 30,000 f ilings per week in the period before 
reform began to seem likely.  Filings coul d be down because at-risk households have 
been strengthening their balance sheets to avoid bankruptcy or, less favorably, because 
they have been deferring payments on their bills without declaring bankruptcy.  Until we 
have further evidence on the relative roles of  these explanations, it will be difficult to 
interpret the recent low levels of bankruptcy filings.   In the first quarter, existing home prices, as measured by the repeat-purchase index from 
the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Over sight (OFHEO), increased at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 7¼ percent.  This p ace, while solid, represents a deceleration from 
preceding quarters.  Increases in prices of home s and equities contribut ed to a rise in net 
worth relative to disposable income in the firs t quarter.  However, the drop in the stock 
market since early May and the expected sl owing in house-price appreciation imply that 
this gain will be reversed in the current quarter.    
Estimated net inflows to equity and bond mutual  funds were sharply lower in May than in 
recent months.  Domestic equity funds had net outflows for the month, and flows to

Treasury and Agency Finance 
Auctions of two-, three-, and ten-year nominal Treasury notes over the intermeeting 
period were well received, with higher than normal bid-to-cover ratios.  The proportion 
of Treasury coupon securities awarded to foreig n investors at auctions  held in April and 
May continued to drift down.  In addition, Tr easury securities held in custody at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf  of foreign official institutions fell 
modestly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  There was much news during the intermee ting period about Fannie Mae’s misdeeds and 
possible reforms of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs); however, Fannie Mae’s 
and Freddie Mac’s stock prices declined about in line with  broad market indexes, and 
their debt spreads to comparable Treasuries stayed within the range seen this year.  
OFHEO released the results of a three-year inquiry in to Fannie Mae’s accounting 
practices that detailed improper smoothi ng of past earnings to boost executive 
compensation.  As a remedial measure for the improper accounting, Fannie Mae signed a 
consent decree with its regulator that incl uded limiting the mortgage holdings in its 
portfolio to $727 billion.  Tr easury officials also called fo r a review of the approval 
process for bond sales by GSEs and raised th e possibility of a new process that might 
limit GSE debt to the funding of mission-relate d activities.  Prospects for GSE reform 
remain uncertain at this point.  
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds stepped up a b it in May, led by new capital 
financing.  Short-term issuance remained light in May, as budget conditions in many 
states improved.     Changes in municipal bond rati ngs continue to indicate ve ry strong credit quality.  
Upgrades far exceeded downgrades, in part because of an upgrade of general-obligation 
bonds in California as a result of increased revenue.  Municipal bond yields fell slightly 
during the intermeeting period, a nd the ratio of muni cipal bond yields to Treasury yields 
remained low, perhaps as a re sult of stronger ratings.

Money and Bank Credit 
M2 growth slowed in April and May, likely because of the deceleration of nominal GDP 
and continued increases in opportunity costs.   Currency and retail money market funds 
expanded more slowly compared with the firs t quarter of the year , while liquid deposits 
ran off.  In contrast, small time deposits con tinued their rapid advance, probably in part 
because rates on these deposits have risen along w ith other short-term rates.  M2 velocity 
had been well below the level predicted by its historical relationship with opportunity 
cost for several quarters, but th e recent slowing of M2 growth partly closed that gap.    
 Bank credit expanded briskly again in May.  Growth of C&I loans was rapid and was 
likely supported by still-strong merger and acq uisition activity.  In addition, according to 
the Survey of Terms of Business Lending condu cted in May, the lending environment has 
stayed accommodative, with spreads of ra tes on C&I loans at banks quite low.  
Commercial and residential mortgages at banks  posted further sizable increases in May, 
while consumer loans adjusted fo r securitizations only edged up.   
 Bank profitability remained strong in the fi rst quarter amid excel lent asset quality, 
according to Call Report data.  Profits were s upported by increases in non-interest income 
and reductions in loan-loss pr ovisions.  These factors more than offset the drag on 
profitability from a further na rrowing of net interest margins.  Delinquency and charge-
off rates stayed low across all loan types.  Ch arge-off rates on consumer loans declined to 
the lowest level seen in recent years, held  down by the low level of bankruptcy filings.

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $63.4 billion in April from $61.9 billion in 
March (revised).  The widening of the deficit in April resulted from a large increase in 
imports, as well as a slight decline in exports.

In April, the value of exports of goods a nd services fell 0.2 percent following a strong 
1.8 percent gain in March.  Exports in April we re held back by a decline in exports of 
aircraft, which, after sizable ga ins in the beginnin g of the year, retreated in March and 
April.  After recording strong growth in Ma rch, exports of consumer goods, computers, 
and agricultural goods slipped back in April.  In contrast, exports of certain industrial 
supplies, including chemicals and fuels, grew strongly in both mont hs, whereas exports 
of semiconductors shot up in April after a fl at March.  Services e xports increased briskly 
in both months, with exports of travel services showing partic ularly strong growth. 
 
Incorporating the annual revisions to the historical data that were released with the April 
trade data, real NIPA exports of goods and se rvices are now estimated to have increased 
14.9 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, little changed from the preliminary NIPA release, 
which reported a gain of 14.7 percent.  Strong exports of aircraft and a rebound in exports

of certain industrial supplies fo llowing a weak fourth quarter  supported the rapid pace of 
export growth in the first quarter. 
 
The value of imported goods and services in creased 0.7 percent in April, following a 
similar-sized gain in March.  In April, the increase in imports primarily reflected a sharp 
rise in the value of imported oil and natural gas.  April’s increase was also supported by 
stronger imports of automotive products and capital goods.  Imports of consumer goods 
declined in April, however, as imports of pharmaceuticals fell back following a surge in March.  Imports of services were essentially  unchanged in April and have remained flat 
since February.  
 
The preliminary NIPA release reported that real imports of goods and services increased 
12.8 percent in the first quarter at an annual ra te, but more recent data  indicate that first- 
quarter growth was 10.5 percent.  During the firs t quarter, declines in  imports of oil and 
natural gas were more than offset by widesp read gains in imports of other goods and a 
strong increase in services imports.  Imports of computers, consumer goods, and automotive products all increased briskly.   
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In May, prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and core goods rose 
0.6 and 0.7 percent, respectively.  Prices for material-intensi ve goods were up sharply.  
After increasing 1 percent in April, prices for non-fuel industrial supplies rose another 
2.9 percent in May, primarily reflecting a 7.8 pe rcent increase in pr ices for unfinished 
metals, the largest monthly increase since the BLS began monthly publication in 1988.  
The increase in the metals index reflected the steep rise in spot markets early in the month; subsequently, spot prices retraced some of their gains.  After falling 0.7 percent in April, food prices recovered, rising 1.3 percent.  Prices of  imported finished goods also 
rose in May.  After falling in March and April, prices for imported consumer goods were up 0.3 percent in May.  Prices for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and automotive products each in creased 0.1 percent.  In contrast, prices 
for imported computers and semiconductors each fell 0.5 percent. 
 
The average level of core import prices in  April and May was 2¼ percent at an annual 
rate above the first-quarter average, mostly reflecting a 14 percen t (a.r.) increase in prices 
for non-fuel industrial supplies.  In a ddition, prices for capital goods (excluding 
computers and semiconductors) and automotive products were up slightly.  Import prices 
for foods and consumer goods each declined.

Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil jump ed 5.2 percent in May.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (W TI) crude oil closed at $68.94 per barrel on June 20, down 
about $2 from its May average.  Early last month, oil prices neared $75 per barrel on 
increased supply fears, particularly as ne gotiations over Iran's nuclear program became 
more heated and attacks conti nued against Nigerian oil infras tructure.  Since that time, 
some progress in negotiations with Iran and the death of a leader of Iraq's insurgency have contributed to lower prices.  In genera l, however, oil prices remain elevated as 
market participants remain concerned that world production capacity  will have difficulty 
keeping pace with relatively robust global oil demand growth. 
 
Exports.   In May, prices of U.S. exports of total goods and core goods increased 0.7 and 
0.8 percent, respectively.  Prices for nonagricultural industria l supplies increased 
1.7 percent in May, on higher prices for metals, fuels, and chemicals.  After falling in 
each of the last three months, agricultural expor t prices rose 0.8 percent.  Within finished 
goods, the most notable price increase was a 0. 5 percent rise for consumer goods.  Prices 
for automotive products, capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors), and computers all increased 0.1 per cent.  In contrast, prices of exported semiconductors fell 
0.1 percent.   
 
The average level of core export prices in  April and May was 5½ percent at an annual 
rate above the first-quarter av erage, as prices increased in  all subcategories, with the 
exception of agricultural products.  A 15 pe rcent (a.r.) increase in prices for 
nonagricultural industrial supplie s was the main contributor to  the overall price increase.  
In addition, export prices for capital goods  (excluding computers and semiconductors) 
rose 3 percent (a.r.).

than offset by increases in exports.  A $25 b illion net decrease in outflows from unilateral 
transfers added to the improveme nt in the current account.  Th e majority of the decrease 
in transfers was associated with a reduction in grants for military purchases of almost $16 billion.   
 
The investment income balance was a positive $14 billion (a.r.) in the first quarter, a 
reversal from the negative balance in the fourth quarter that had followed positive but 
IV-8 
downward trending net investment income balances in previous quarters.  The 
improvement was more than accounted for by an increase in direct investment receipts 
and a decrease in direct investment payments .  The balance on other investment income 
continued to worsen.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
With the release of the first-quarter current account transactions data, BEA also released 
data on the associated financial flows.  Thes e data are reported in the Summary of U.S. 
International Transactions table.  Recorded net private financial inflows in the first 
quarter totalled nearly $82 billion, only half those of the fourth quarter, while official inflows were roughly unchanged at $76 billi on.  As the current account deficit narrowed 
only slightly, the statistical discrepancy sw ung from negative $19 billion in the fourth 
quarter to a positive $53 billion in the first quarter.    
 
In large part, the smaller first-quarter net private financial inflows reflect a swing from net inflows through direct investment in th e fourth quarter of 2005 to the more normal 
pattern of net outflows.  U.S. direct investme nt abroad (line 6), which recorded atypical 
inflows in the second half of la st year, recorded a very large outflow in the first quarter.  
Over the past few quarters, direct investment  abroad has been affected by the partial tax 
holiday established in the 2004 American  Jobs Creation Act (also known as the 
IV-9 
Homeland Investment Act, HIA).  Under this  one-fiscal-year tax holiday, multinational 
corporations that repatriate previously retained earnings from foreign affiliates and 
reinvest them in the United States are subj ect to a reduced effective tax rate on those 
earnings.  As multinationals took advantage of this tax provision, sizable repatriated 
earnings were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2005.  By our estimate, foreign 
affiliates have remitted over $200 billion of prev iously retained earnings under the HIA.  
While it appears that some firms continued to  take advantage of the HIA in the first 
quarter, it also appears that some firms re tained an unusually large portion of their 
earnings abroad in an effort to unwind the bala nce-sheet impact of th eir use of the HIA.  
On net, retained earnings, and hence financ ial flows associated with U.S. direct 
investment abroad, returned to a more typi cal pattern in the first quarter.  Flows of 
foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) move d up in the first quarter to a 
bit above the average le vel recorded in 2005.   
  
The financial flows data also included some modest revisions t o foreign official inflows 
(line 1) and foreign private ne t purchases of U.S. securities  (line 4), based on results of 
the newly-released survey of foreign holdings  of U.S. securities as of June 2005.  The 
survey indicated somewhat lower foreign holdin gs of U.S. securities, especially Treasury 
securities, than previously available data s uggested.  Both foreign official and private 
securities inflows for 2005 were revised down by about $10 billion.  
 The most recent data on securities transacti ons sh
 ow that foreign private purchases of 
U.S. securities slowed noticeably in April from the robust pace recorded in the first 
quarter.  Foreign private dema nd for all types of securities weakened, as investors on net 
sold Treasury securities ( line 4a) and acquired very limited amounts of agency bonds 
(line 4b) and equities (line 4d).  Net purchase s of corporate bonds ( line 4c) fell back from 
the near-record inflow posted in March but rema ined near the healthy average pace of the 
past several months.  Weaker net securities purchases were recorded primarily against the 
United Kingdom and the Caribbean banking centers , but as the monthly transactions data 
are recorded against country of first transa ctor, the slowdown in activity against these 
financial centers provides little information about the residence of the ultimate foreign 
purchasers or sellers.      Foreign official flows into the United States  (line 1) m
 oved up a b it in April, primarily 
reflecting larger inflows from OPEC and Russia 
  For the first four months of the year, official inflows have been running at a pace 
well above that of 2005.  

IV-10 
  
.  Although official inflow s from OPEC over the past few quarters 
are small relative to their oil revenues, we have seen a pickup this year in inflows 
identified with middle-eastern oil producers.  Official inflows from  other oil producers, 
especially Norway and Russia, have been vol atile, most likely reflecting active portfolio 
management of oil revenues.  Partial and confidential informati on on custody holdings at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York i ndicate moderately strong foreign official 
inflows in May and strong inflows in the first half of June, .   
 
U.S. residents’ acquisitions of foreign securiti es ( line 5) eased a bit in April, but for the 
year to date acquisitions of foreign securities are running a bit above the pace of last year.  
Demand for foreign equity (line 5b), pr imarily from Asia, remained strong.   
 The banking sector (line 3) posted an unusually large net in flow in April, prim
 arily 
reflecting record inflows from affiliated banki ng offices.  These data tend to be volatile 
on a monthly basis, with large inflows one month often followed by large outflows the next.  Nonetheless, the sizable banking inflow  recorded in April may in part reflect an 
offset of the swing to net outflows in direct  investment in the first quarter, as U.S. 
multinationals returned to placing funds in  overseas banking offices, thus providing an 
ample source of funding for U. S.-based banking offices.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
After moving little on balance during much of May, the dollar’s weighted-average 
exchange value against other major currenc ies moved up in early June, rising 1-3/4 
percent on net over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated following Chairman 
Bernanke’s comments on June 5, which were interpreted by market participants as 
suggesting a higher likelihood of policy tightenin g at the late-June FOMC meeting.  On a 
bilateral basis, the dollar appr eciated about 4 percent agains t the yen, as Governor Fukui 
reiterated that the Bank of Japan’s policy rate  would likely remain close to zero for some 
time. The dollar appreciated 1-1/4 percent on ne t against the euro, as market expectations 
of further monetary tightening by the ECB re portedly decreased in early June. The dollar 
appreciated 3/4 percent against the Canadian dollar, in part in response to signals from 
the Bank of Canada that the latest increase of  its policy rate should be sufficient to keep 
inflation contained a nd the economy on track.  
 
Over the intermeeting period, headline equity  indexes fell 8 to 13 percent on net in the 
euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and about 6 percent in the United 
States. They dropped even more in the emerging market economies, where share prices 
had previously moved up sharply. With no majo r negative corporate earnings surprises, 
market participants attributed the drops in share prices to increas ed uncertainty about 
prospective inflation and global economic grow th. Consistent with these drops in share 
prices and heightened uncertainty, implied and realized volatilities on headline equity 
indexes increased. With these drops, headline equity indexes are currently roughly unchanged on balance in Europe and North Am erica, in local-currency terms, since the 
beginning of the year, but are down about 9 percent in Japan. 
 
The Bank of England did not change its m onetary policy stance over the intermeeting 
period. By early June, the Bank of Japan had run down the current account balances held 
by commercial banks to about ¥10 trillion. It ra ised these balances to ¥13 trillion on June 
16 and to ¥17.6 trillion on June 20 to keep the interbank overnight rate  close to zero. The 
European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, and Sweden’s Riksbank each raised their policy rates 25 basis points; short-term market interest rates in 
the respective economies rose 10 to 20 basis points over the intermeeting period. 
 
Realized volatility of ten-year government bonds was little changed in most industrial 
economies over the intermeeting period, despit e mixed data releases on inflation and 
economic growth. On balance, benchmark bond yields dropped 15 basis points in Japan 
IV-13 
and were little changed in Canada, the euro  area, and the United Kingdom. In contrast, 
inflation-indexed benchmark bond yields were little changed in Japan and rose 7 to 12 
basis points in the euro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In mid-May, sovereign 
bond yields in Europe and Canada decreased  following a statement by French Finance 
Minister Thierry Breton that “everything must be done to prevent the euro from 
strengthening against the dollar, since the eu ro’s strength would be harmful to economic 
growth in Europe,” and on lower-than-expected  Canadian core CPI data for April. Later 
in the intermeeting period, these yields in creased on several higher-than-expected euro-
area and Canadian data releases. Yields moved down on the lower-than-expected May 
U.S. employment report, but rose on Chai rman Bernanke’s statements on June 5 on 
inflation concerns, a much better-than-expected Canadian employment report for May, 
and a higher-than-expected rate of Canadian core inflation in May.  
 Consistent with market reports  of flight-to-quality m
 oves in  mid to late May, the dollar 
appreciated over the intermeeting period agains t most emerging market currencies; Latin 
American and emerging Asian equity indexes fell even more steeply than those in the industrial countries, and risk spreads on dollar-denominated sovereign debt widened. The 
EMBI+ spreads increased about 35 basis poi nts for Mexico and Brazil, and 60 basis 
points for Argentina, more than reversing the declines to multi-year lows that these spreads had registered earlier this year.   
 
Since May 9, spot gold prices have tumbled $125 per ounce, or alm
 ost 18 percent. Silver 
and copper prices have fallen 28 percent and 16 percent, respectivel y, retracing some but 
not all of their sharp rises since the start of  the year. Prices of other precious and base 
metals also dropped sharply over the intermeeting period. 
 
  The Desk did not intervene during 
the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries 
 
The foreign industrial countries gr ew at healthy rates in the fi rst quarter.  GDP in the euro 
area and Canada accelerated, while the United Kingdom maintained its pace from the 
fourth quarter.  Although growth in Japan slowed, it wa s on the high side of most 
analysts’ expectations and do mestic demand remained strong.  Data on real economic 
activity in the second qu arter point to a possible slowing in  Canada, but there are signs of 
a further pick-up in the euro area and of continued growth in Japan and the 
United Kingdom, notwithstanding sharp declines  in equity indexes in these countries.  
 
The central banks of the euro area and Canada  both tightened policy in the intermeeting   
period.  The European Central Bank cited inflat ion fears in enacting its  rate hike.  The  
Bank of Canada, at the time of its tightening, st ated that inflation wa s evolving in line  
with its expectations, but subsequent data in dicate that inflation has risen further.   
Inflation in the United Kingdom moved above the Bank of England’s targ et.  Inflation in  
Japan rose slightly, helping to solidify confid ence that deflation in consumer prices has  
ended.  Despite the increases in headline in flation, core inflation remained below 2  
percent in most countries.  
 
First-quarter GDP in Japan grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent.  Although overall growth slowed from the pace in the fourth quarter, private domestic demand accelerated.  Household consumption rose 2 percent and private gross fixed investment rose  11.2 percent.  In contrast, public spending cha nged little, and net exports were flat despite 
a 15 percent increase in imports as exports ne arly matched this pace.  The GDP deflator 
fell 1.2 percent from a year ago, close to its av erage rate over the last two years; however, 
there were some signs for optimism as the deflator for household consumption fell only 
0.2 percent, the smallest decline in six years. 
 
Indicators point to a stro ng start for investment spending in the second quarter. 
Production of capital goods rose  8.9 percent in April, whil e shipments of capital goods 
rose 12.9 percent and core machinery orders (excluding ships and orders from electric 
power plants) rebounded 10.8 percent.  The cons truction sector also appeared strong, as 
housing starts rose 9.1 percent.  Indicators of household demand were weaker, however; 
average new car registrations for the first tw o months of the quarter declined 2.9 percent 
from the first quarter’s average, and a lthough real spending by households rose  
0.4 percent in April, retail sales fell slightly.  The external s ector also registered a weak 
beginning to the quarter; real exports edged down 0.6 percent in April while real imports 
IV-20 
rose 2.9 percent.  Despite this somewhat mixed data, the labor market continued to 
improve, with the unemployment rate remaini ng at 4.1 percent in April and the offers-to-
applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings rela tive to the number of 
officially registered job seekers) returning to a th irteen-year high.

Core consumer prices (which exclude fres h food but include ener gy) in the Tokyo area 
rose 0.2 percent in May and were 0.4 percen t higher than a year ago, while nation-wide 
core consumer prices remained 0.5 percent higher than a year earlier in April.  Trends in 
energy prices continued to play an important role in inflation, as twelve-month inflation 
in consumer prices for the country ex cluding both fresh food and energy was only 
0.2 percent.  In a further sign that deflation is ending, urba n land prices in Japan’s six 
largest cities rose 3.8 percen t from a year ago in the first quarter of 2006, marking the 
first increase since 1991.  
 
The Bank of Japan maintained its policy of k eeping overnight rates near zero.  The Bank 
temporarily halted the decline in its outstanding balance of reserves accounts when overnight interest rates approached the Bank’ s ceiling of 0.1 percent.  The outstanding 
balance of reserve accounts is now about ¥17 trillion, down from a range of ¥30 - ¥35 
trillion under the Bank’s previous policy of quantitative easing.

Euro-area  real GDP accelerated to an annual grow th rate of 2.4 pe rcent in the first 
quarter from 1.2 percent in the previous quarter.  Final domestic demand contributed 
2.2 percentage points to GDP gr owth, fueled by a 2.8 percent rise in private consumption.  
International trade also supported the fi rst-quarter rebound; ex port growth outpaced 
import growth, on net adding 1.1 percen tage points to GDP growth.   
 
Recent data suggest that household spending has continued to buoy activity in the second 
quarter.  The average volume of euro-area reta il sales rose 1.3 per cent in April from the 
previous month, paced by continued strong sales in France and by resurgent sales in 
Germany, which jumped 4.3 percent.  Euro-a rea consumer confidence moved up further 
in May to a 3½-year high, buoyed by a sharp improvement in perceptions of employment 
prospects as the euro-area harmonized unemploym ent rate remained at a four-year low of 
8 percent in April.  German industrial produc tion rose 1.6 percent in April, as output in 
the construction industry rebounded sharply fr om a decline in March caused by poor 
weather, but production fell more than 1 pe rcent in France and Italy, leading overall 
euro-area IP to fall 0.6 percent.  Other indicat ors, however, point to rising production; the 
IV-22 
euro-area PMI advanced further in May for both the manufacturing and services sectors, 
reaching the highest levels since 2000.  
 
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in May  from the previous month.  The 
12-month rate of inflation edged up to 2.5 pe rcent.  Core inflation, excluding energy and 
unprocessed food, fell back to 1.5 percent in Ma y after reaching 1.6 per cent in April.  The 
European Central Bank raised its main refinanc ing rate to 2.75 percen t at its June policy 
meeting, citing elevated inflation pr essures and strong credit growth.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 2.3 percent (a.r.) in  the first quarter, revised 
down from a preliminary estimate of 2.6 pe rcent.  Private consumption grew only 
1.2 percent, after increasing 3.2 pe rcent in the fourth quarter, but fixed investment surged 
6.2 percent, well above its 2005 pace.  Net expor ts subtracted 1.8 per centage points from 
growth, as imports and exports rose  24 and 20 percent, respectively.   
 
Incoming data paint a mixed picture for the second quarter.  Industrial production fell 
0.5 percent in April, with manufacturing producti on falling 0.2 percent. In contrast, retail 
sales grew a robust 0.5 percent in May, the f ourth successive month-on-month increase.  
Housing demand also appears to be growing moderately.  The twelve-month change in 
house prices in May was 10 percent according to the Halifax House Price Index, and net 
mortgage lending has been fairly stable  between £8 and £9 billion since late 2005, 
compared with a high of nearly £10 billion re ached at the peak of housing market activity 
in  2003.  However, the number of loan s approved for house purchase dropped from 
119,000 in January to 106,000 in April, indicating some risk of a slowdown in the 
housing market over the next several months. 
 
The twelve-month change in consumer prices rose to 2.2 percent in May, above the Bank 
of England’s target of 2 percent.  In its May  meeting, the Bank of England’s Monetary

In Canada, real GDP grew 3.8 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, led by a jump in 
consumer spending on durables a nd housing.  Investment in resi dential structures grew at 
its fastest rate in over two years, and busin ess investment continued its strength of the 
previous two quarters, contribu ting 1.9 percentage points to gr owth.  The level of exports 
fell a bit, but because imports declined by more, net exports contributed 0.3 percentage 
point to overall GDP growth, only the sec ond positive contribution of net exports to 
growth in the past seven quarters. 
 
Overall, indicators for the second quarter point  to a deceleration of GDP.  Housing starts 
fell sharply between March and April and rema ined at this lower level in May, although 
starts continued to be elevated.  The merc handise trade balance declined for a fourth 
consecutive month in April.  The volume of manufacturing new orders and shipments 
both fell in April, with shipments declining in  two-thirds of manufacturing industries.   
In contrast, the labor market continued its st rength of the past year, adding about 20,000 
jobs in April and nearly 100,000 jobs in May, most of which were full-time positions in 
the service sector.  The very strong May pushed the unemployment rate down to 
6.1 percent, a 32-year-low, and the employment rate (the fraction of the working-age 
population that is employed) to a record-high of 63.2 percent.  The retail sector provided 
another clear bright spot, as  the volume of retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April. 
 
On May 24, the Bank of Canada increased its ta rget for the overnigh t rate ¼-percentage 
point to 4.25 percent, following ¼ percentage point increases at each of its previous six 
meetings.  In its accompanying statement,  the Bank said that “…both CPI and core 
inflation are evolving largely in line with th e Bank’s expectations” and that the policy 
rate is “…now at a level that  is expected to keep the Ca nadian economy on the base-case 
path…”  Market participants appeared to interpret these statements as a signal the Bank might pause in its rate-hike campaign; howev er, participants may have become more 
wary of that interpretation as recent in flation data has exceeded expectations.  The 
twelve-month rate of consumer price infla tion jumped to 2.8 percent in May while the 
twelve-month rate of core inflation, which ex cludes the eight most volatile components, 
rose to 2 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Incoming data for emerging market economies indicate activity accelerated moderately in 
the first quarter, led by a str ong performance in Latin America, particularly in Mexico 
and Brazil.  Average economic growth in em erging Asia continued at the same strong 
pace of the fourth quarter, as Chinese growth surged but activity in Singapore, Korea, and 
Taiwan decelerated.  In the second quarter, economic indicators are consistent with 
moderation and with a slight rise  in inflation, particularly in Asia.  Sharp declines in asset 
prices have led to difficulties in some vulne rable emerging markets countries, particularly 
Turkey, but do not appear to have ha d more generalized effects to date. 
 
Chinese  economic data point to c ontinued rapid growth.  In  May, industrial production 
jumped over 3 percent, after holding flat the previous month.  In the twelve-month period 
ending May, retail sales rose 14 percent, the fastest pace in over a year, while bank loan 
and M2 growth picked up, the latter to 20 per cent.  In response, the central bank raised 
reserve requirements for commercial banks ½ percentage point.  The trade surplus 
moderated a bit to $145 billion (a.r.) in  May after sluggish import performance 
contributed to a record-setting April surplu s of almost $170 billion.  Investment rose 
more than 30 percent over the twelve mont hs ending in May, despite recent government 
measures to slow growth.  The government recently enacted a series of additional measures to slow investment in real estate , including raising down payment requirements, 
tightening lending restrictions on developers, and levying a tax on homes sold within five 
years of purchase.  The government’s target fo r investment growth in 2006 is 18 percent.  
Consumer price inflation edged up to 1.4 per cent over the twelve months ending in May.

In Hong Kong, real GDP jumped 10 percent (a.r.) in  the first quarter, driven largely by 
strong growth in real exports of goods and serv ices.  In April, twelve-month inflation rose 
to 2.3 percent, largely reflecti ng rising housing rents, while the trade deficit widened as 
import growth outpaced export growth.  In May, the unemployment rate edged down to 
its lowest level in almost five years.

In Taiwan , real GDP contracted slightly in the first quarter, largely due to a decline in net 
exports.  In April, however, export orders for electronics increased smartly, contributing 
to sizeable trade surpluses in April and May.  Twelve-month inflation bottomed out in 
March before rising to 1.6 percent in Ma y, as food and energy prices increased.

In Korea , incoming data suggest continued mode ration in economic growth from last 
year’s fast pace.  Industrial production fell 1.5 percent in April.  Outside of the high-tech 
and energy sectors, losses were widespread, particularly in the auto sector, which 
experienced labor-related disruptions.  Moreover, recent consumer and business 
confidence surveys have fallen sharply from th eir Q4 peaks.  In Ap ril, a current account 
deficit of over $18 billion (not-seasonally adjusted), in part, reflected sluggish exports.  Consumer prices rose 2.4 per cent over the twelve months ending in May.  The Bank of 
Korea raised its target rate 25 basis points to  4.25 percent in earl y June, citing continued 
economic recovery, persistently high oil pr ices, and a rebound in real estate prices.

Incoming ASEAN  GDP data indicate that growth modera ted in the first quarter, except in 
Malaysia.  The external sector supported growth; however, domestic factors, such as 
Indonesia’s earlier monetary ti ghtening and removal of fuel subsidies, a higher VAT in 
the Philippines, and political instability in  Thailand, weighed on ac tivity.  More recently, 
industrial production fell in Malaysia, Singa pore, and Thailand in April and trade 
surpluses narrowed. 
 
Consumer price inflation remained elevated  in much of the region, mainly due to a 
run-up in food and energy prices.  In Indonesia,  inflation remained below its peak in the 
fourth quarter, when the government sharpl y reduced fuel subsidies.  Citing the 
moderation in inflation and w eakness in domestic demand, the central bank of Indonesia 
cut interest rates 25 basis points in early Ma y.  In contrast, the Ba nk of Thailand further 
IV-33 
raised its benchmark interest rate 25 basis points in early June to contain inflationary 
pressures, but signaled it will likely pause before raising rates again. 
 
In late May, Indonesia announced plans to use fore ign reserves held at the central bank to 
pay off by 2007 the remaining $7.8 billion in ou tstanding debt owed to the IMF.  The 
original payment schedule called for final payment by 2010.

Performance of the Indian  economy remains robust.  GDP growth soared 15.6 percent 
(a.r.) in the first quarter, led by sharp increases in agri culture and serv ices.  More 
recently, industrial production rose 1 percent in  April after an almost 2½ percent gain in 
March.  In early June, the government announced  it was raising gasolin e and diesel prices 
by over 9 and 6 percent, respectively.  Possibly in response to this, as well as the strong 
GDP figure, the Bank of India surprised market s in early June by hiking the reverse repo 
rate 25 basis points to 5.75 percent, in advan ce of its scheduled policy meeting in July.

In Mexico , first-quarter real GDP rose a higher-t han-expected 6.3 percent (a.r.), with 
gains widespread across sectors.  In April,  industrial production more  than reversed its 
March decline, rising to a level about ¾ per cent above the first-quarter average, following 
a gain of nearly 2 percent in the first quart er.  Recent data on U.S. manufacturing IP, 
which tracks Mexican GDP growth relatively well, also suggest growth moderated in the 
second quarter.  The trade balance was positive in the first quarter on the back of a surge 
in automobile exports, but was negative in April, as imports increased. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation declined to 3 percent in May, at the center of the Bank 
of Mexico’s 2-to-4 percent target range, desp ite the noticeable depreciation of the peso in 
recent months.  On the political front, recent opinion polls suggest that conservative 
Felipe Calderon is in a statistical tie with leftist Andres Manuel Lopez-Obrador heading 
into the July 2 presidential election.

In Brazil , real GDP jumped 5.7 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, supported by very strong 
performance in manufacturing, mining, and construction.  Incoming second-quarter 
indicators are mixed.  April industrial produc tion was flat following a dip the previous 
month, but auto sales for April and May we re strong. Twelve-month inflation continued 
its decline, falling to 4.2 percent in May, aided by dec lining prices for ethanol. 
 
In late May, the central bank reduced its ta rget for the overnight interest rate by 
50 basis points to 15.25 percent, bringing the cumulative decline to 450 basis points since 
the current easing phase began last September.   The minutes of the meeting, released a 
week later, indicated that the onset of market  volatility over the past month had increased 
the committee’s uncertainty about inflation pros pects, prompting it to temper the extent 
of easing.  The Brazilian government also re sponded to the volatility by canceling its 
scheduled auctions of fixed-rate and CPI-li nked debts, by buying back some of its CPI-
linked debt, and by reinstating auctions of floatin g rate debt in late Ma y.  So far this year, 
the government has retired $13 billion in external debt (mostly through debt buybacks 
and the exercise of call options on Brady bonds) out of $20 billion it announced earlier in the year.  Recent polls suggest Lula remains comfortably in the lead in the run up to the October presidential election.

In Argentina , after a strong fourth quarter, output grow th subsided to 4.7 percent (a.r.) in 
the first quarter, with the deceleration widespr ead across sectors.  At the same time, the 
unemployment rate moved up, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, as it has in the first 
quarter of previous years.  In April, industr ial production rose modestly from the previous 
month; on a twelve-month basis, IP was up 7¾ percent, owing largely to increased 
production of automobiles, cement and agricu ltural chemicals.  In May, twelve-month 
inflation edged down to 11.5 percent, in part due to the voluntary price agreements the 
government has secured in several sectors.

In Venezuela , real GDP decelerated in the first qu arter, but growth was still high at 
8.6 percent (a.r.).  High petroleum prices and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies 
have supported the strong growth seen over th e past two years.  In flation declined on a 
twelve-month basis to 10.4 percent in May.  Despite high oil prices, the central bank’s 
international reserves have remained below $30 billion over the past year, as the Chavez 
government transferred oil profits to off-budge t funds used to support spending.  In June, 
the government proposed replacing the boliv ar, which has been pegged at 2,150 to the 
dollar since early 2005, with a new currency that would be worth 2.15 to the dollar, 
starting in 2008.

In Turkey , real GDP rose almost 9.4 percent in th e fourth quarter from a year earlier, 
driven in part by increases in private c onsumption and investment.  Reflecting strong 
domestic demand and the depreciation of the Tu rkish lira (24 percent since the beginning 
of the year), twelve-month inflation reached almost 10 percent in May (led by increases 
in clothing prices), well above  the central bank's year-end upper target of 7 percent.  
Producer price inflation for May suggests th at supply shocks from metals and energy 
prices may also be fuelling overall inflati on.  However, the weaker lira should help 
narrow the current account deficit, which re ached 7 percent of GDP in April.   
 
In response to rising inflation and to recent financial market turbulence, in early June the 
central bank raised its key interest rates 175 basis points to  15 percent for the borrowing 
rate and 18 percent for the lending rate.  In its latest auction, the Turkish Treasury paid 
roughly 400 basis points more on its 2-year bond than in the last auction about a month 
earlier.  The main equity index has fallen  about 15 percent (year-to-date), and the 
sovereign bond spread has risen about 60 basi s points over the past month (although it is 
still about 10 basis points lower than a year  ago).  In addition, though there have been 
some delays, Turkey remains on-track in both its IMF review and EU-accession talks.
