Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1  
Economic activity expanded at a more restrain ed pace in the second quarter than in the 
first quarter and less rapidly than in 2005.  The moderation was most evident in the 
household sector, where consumer spending pos ted a smaller increase and residential 
investment turned down more noticeably.  In  the business sector, investment spending 
decelerated sharply in the second quarter af ter expanding rapidly earlier in the year, but 
high-frequency indicators—such as orders and shipments—gene rally remained favorable.  
Industrial production increased at  a robust rate in June and in the second quarter as a 
whole, with gains spread wide ly across industries, and the cap acity utilization rate moved 
up further.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate  held steady in June while the pace of 
hiring continued on its recent more-subdued trac k.  Consumer prices accelerated in the 
second quarter, led by rising ener gy prices, and core consumer prices also increased more 
rapidly.   
 
Labor Market Developments  
The pace of hiring stepped down in the sec ond quarter relative to the several preceding 
quarters.  Private payroll employment rose  90,000 in June, bringing the average monthly 
gain in the second quarter to 86,000, dow n noticeably from the 169,000 per month pace 
in the first quarter.  Although employment in the services sector e xpanded steadily in 
recent months, hiring in the construction and retail trade sectors slackened markedly.  
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisor y workers rose at an annual rate of 
2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from 3.0 percent in the first quarter. 
 
At 4.6 percent, the unemployment rate was unchanged in June from its May level, while 
the labor force participation rate  edged up to 66.2 percent, its hi ghest level since last year.  
In contrast, the percentage of  people working part time for economic reasons turned up of 
late.  In addition, the proporti on of individuals who quit work to search for a new job fell, 
which may suggest that employed workers ar e becoming less optimistic about alternative 
employment prospects.  
 
Other labor market indicators  point to further moderate growth in labor demand.  The 
four-week moving average of initial clai ms for unemployment insurance was 314,000 in 
the week ending July 29, in the same general range of the past several months.  Similarly, 
the exhaustion rate indicates that the pace at which claimants are findi ng jobs before their 
benefits run out has, on net, been moving sideways.  In addition, according to the Job 
Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the rate of job openings has been about flat since the end of 2005.  Moreover, vari ous surveys of households and businesses

Based on the latest national income and product accounts (NIPA) data, the staff estimates 
that productivity in the nonfarm business sector  increased at an annua l rate of 4.0 percent 
in the first quarter and 2.2 per cent in the second quarter.  Ov er the four quarters ending in 
the second quarter of 2006, productivity rose an estimated 2.6 percent, a step up from the 
1.7 percent pace in the preceding four quarters.

Industrial Production  
Total industrial production rose 0.8 percent in June and increa sed at a robust annual rate 
of 6.6 percent for the second quarter as a whol e.  Activity in the manufacturing sector 
strengthened in June and e xpanded 5.4 percent for the quart er; gains were widespread 
among industries.  Mining output increased 9 percent in the sec ond quarter, supported by 
continued, though waning, hurricane-related rec overy efforts in th e energy-extraction 
industries.  The output at util ities jumped more than 15 perc ent in the second quarter, an 
increase that largely reversed a weather-related drop in the first quarter. 
 
The utilization of industrial capacity in June st ood at its highest level in six years.  Over 
the past 3½ years, utilization rates have risen fa irly steadily at all stages of processing.  In 
June, the operating rate among industries in the crude stag e was nearly 3 percentage 
points above its 1972–2005 average.  Among pr imary and semifinished producers, the 
operating rate was 1.2 percentage points above av erage, and for industries in the finished 
stage, the operating rate wa s 1.8 percentage points above average.  Moreover, the 
increase in the rate of capacity utilizati on in recent years has been widespread across 
manufacturing industries.

As the pace of hurricane-related recovery abated  in the second quarter, the gains in crude 
oil and natural gas production moderated.  Howe ver, the available week ly data point to a 
jump in crude oil production in July.  In the Gulf of Mexico, the cr ude oil and natural gas 
platforms that are still not operating account fo r less than 2 percent of domestic oil and 
gas extraction capacity.  Sepa rately, about 2 percent of domestic petroleum-refining 
capacity is off line because of hurricane-related and other reasons.  Refinery output 
dropped sharply in March and April because of  the switch to ethanol-blended gasoline, 
but it bounced back by the end of June and appear s to have been little changed in July.  
However, even during the switchove r to ethanol-based blends of  gasoline, refineries were 
operating at above-average rates of utilization.   
 
Motor vehicle production moved up in June to  an annual rate of 11.6 million units, which 
was the same as the average rate of production in the second quarter.  Over the first half 
of the year, production of cars increased a l ittle relative to th e average pace in 2005, 
while production of light trucks  was notably lower.  However,  inventories of light trucks 
were elevated at the end of J une because of sluggish sales during the first half of the year.  
Overall days’ supply for light ve hicles at the end of the seco nd quarter stood at 75 days, 
well above the industry-preferred norm of about 65 days.  For July, industry assembly schedules suggest that the ra te of production was about uncha nged.  For the third quarter 
as a whole, production is also scheduled to  hold steady at a rate of about 11.6 million 
units. 
 
Output in the high-technology sector increased 1.1 percent in June and rose at an annual 
rate of nearly 19 percent for the second quart er as a whole.  This increase, which is 
relatively modest by historical standards, obscures an appreciable divergence among the 
components of total high-technology output.  The output of comm unications equipment 
jumped at an annual rate of nearly 40 percen t in the second quarter after a 30 percent rate 
of increase in the first quarte r.  Production of communications  equipment in the first half 
of 2006 was elevated by robust business spending on voice and data-networking 
equipment.1  In addition, telecommuni cation service providers ha ve been upgrading their 
networks to build-out the infrastructure n eeded to provide households with combined 
voice, data, and television service over a single high-speed Internet connection. 
 
                                                 
1 In particular, the demand for voice-switching equi pment necessary to suppor t Internet-based voice 
communications—so-called voice-over-Internet protocol, or VOIP—has been an important driver of recent 
business spending on communications equipment.

In contrast, computer production remained rela tively restrained last quarter despite an 
increase in units produced.  Unit sales of pe rsonal computers (PCs) turned up in response 
to price cuts, but anecdotal evidence indicate s that part of the increase in demand was 
directed toward lower-end PCs that have a relatively smaller impact on industrial 
production.  Unit sales of servers appear to ha ve reversed a small decline in the first 
quarter but were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter, suggesting some softness 
in commercial sales.  The production of microprocessors (MPUs), which are principally 
used in computers, has been weak recentl y, and Intel’s revenue guidance for the third 
quarter points to only a modest increase in production in the n ear term.  However, Intel is 
continuing to roll out new chips that are cons iderably faster and more energy-efficient—
attributes that are likely to be  highly valued by corporate customers.  Industry analysts 
expect that demand for these new chips will in crease Intel’s market share, which would 
tend to boost IP later this year.2  The output of chips other than MPUs has been well 
maintained and is being supported by demand for cell phones and other consumer 
electronics and by business spendi ng on communications equipment. 
 
Among market groups excluding energy, motor ve hicles and parts, and high-technology 
products, output gains were generally strong in June.  All of th e major market groups 
posted solid increases with the exception of  consumer goods, which were unchanged in 
June but still up at an annual rate of 2½ percent for the second qua rter.  The output of 
business equipment advanced in the second qua rter at an annual rate of more than 
12½ percent, and the output of defense and spa ce equipment climbed at an annual rate of 
7 percent.  The output of materials rose at an  annual rate of almost 5 percent, and the 
production of business supplies increased at an annual rate of about 4 percent.  
Construction supplies declined at an annual ra te of about 1 percent after having been at a 
level elevated by favorable weat her in the first quarter.   
 
In general, domestic production appears to  have benefited from brisk foreign demand, 
which has been boosted by the lagged effects of  a lower exchange value of the dollar and 
strong foreign output growth.  Indeed, the manufacturing export share—defined as the 
ratio of nominal exports of  manufactured goods to nominal shipments—moved up in 
recent months, while the nominal import share leveled off.   
 
                                                 
2  Intel’s main competitor—Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)—does not yet produce in the United 
States, and therefore changes in market share can ha ve a significant effect on domestic semiconductor 
production.  However, AMD has announced plans to bu ild a $3 billion semiconductor fabrication facility in 
upstate New York that will likely begin production between 2013 and 2015.

Near-term indicators of production have generall y remained favorable.  The latest reading 
of the new orders diffusion index from the Institute for Supply Managements is 
consistent with moderate gains in manuf acturing output in comi ng months.  The new 
orders indexes from the various  regional surveys also point to  further increases in near-
term production.    
 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles picked up in July to a 17.1 million unit annual rate from the soft 
reading of 16.1 million units in June.  Sales were boosted by a step-up in incentives that 
began in late June, and industry anecdotes indicate that sales shot up over the long 
Independence Day weekend.  A new round of incentives was introduced later in July 
after sales fell back, with some targeted  specifically at larg e and midsize SUVs.3  Sales of 
light trucks rebounded somewhat in June and July after having fallen back sharply in 
April and May.  Despite the increase in light -truck sales, the average fuel economy for 
light vehicles sold moved up in July, and the average market share for the Big Three 
automakers moved further below its alrea dy low level from earlier in the year.  
 
Recent indicators of motor vehicle sentiment are consistent with a gradual strengthening 
in retail demand for motor vehicles.  According to the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumer Attitudes, consumer assessments  of car-buying conditi ons improved in June 
and edged up further in July, mostly reflect ing a reported decline in  consumers’ anxiety 
over gas prices.  The percentage of househol ds in the survey reporting that it was a bad 
time to buy a car because of high gasoline pric es fell back in July to 13 percent, down 
from the record-high level of 25 percent obser ved in May.  However, the recent surge in 
gasoline prices may have occurred too late to ha ve been fully reflected in the July survey.  
 
                                                 
3 According to J.D. Power and Associates, the av erage value of incentives received by new car 
purchasers increased $84 in June and climbed an additional $216 through the week including July 4.  This 
measure then plummeted after the temporary promotions expired, even though the automakers continued to offer generous cash rebates, gas cards, and zero-interest financing.  Industry anecdotes suggest that the 
promotions at the beginning of July pulled many sales forward.  Subsequently, prospective buyers who had 
not yet purchased may have been waiting for incentives to increase again near the end of the month.

Looking ahead, most of our industry contacts anticipate that the recent improvements in 
sales will continue through th e third quarter, although they al so expect sales for 2006 as a 
whole to come in a bit below the 16.9 million units sold in 2005.  Model year-end promotions aside, General Moto rs continues to assert that its use of incentives will be 
more restrained than in r ecent years, and several automa kers are counting on their new 
2007 model introductions to maintain sales momentum this fall.  Because the mix of sales continues to shift toward vehicles with hi gher fuel economy, many of the new models are 
in the increasingly popular crossover market segment.

Consumer Spending 
The growth of consumer spending slowed c onsiderably in the second quarter after the 
surge in purchases around the turn of th e year.  Real consumer spending moved up 
0.2 percent in June after similar modest gains in April and May.  Excluding motor 
vehicles, spending for goods perked up in June  after remaining flat, on average, over the 
previous four months.  Consumer spending on services, which had been trending up this year, decelerated in June and was held back by a drop in real outlays  for energy services 
and financial services (sp ecifically, brokerage fees). 
 
The slower pace of consumer expenditures this spring was accompanied by a moderation in real income growth and continued incr eases in borrowing costs.  Although nominal 
compensation rose briskly in the first half of  the year, real gains were damped by rising 
consumer price inflation.  In June, real disposable personal income increased 0.4 percent after no change, on average, over the previous five months.  However, consumer 
spending continues to be supported by past ga ins in household wealth, particularly from 
the earlier rapid rise in home prices.  In creases in outlays have outpaced gains in 
disposable income, on average, since late last year, and the personal saving rate has 
declined, reaching negative 1½ percent in June. 
 
Recent readings on consumer confidence have been mixed.  The July index from the Michigan survey edged down a bit and is consistent with continued subpar gains in 
household spending.  In contrast, confiden ce as measured by the Conference Board 
remained somewhat more upbeat.  
 
                                                 
4 Crossovers resemble small SUVs but are built on car platforms, which are more fuel efficient than the 
truck platforms used for traditional SUVs.  Nonetheless, crossovers are classified as light trucks by the 
industry.

Housing   
Residential construction activity has continue d to  recede over the past few months.  
Single-family starts fell to an annual rate  of 1.49 million units in June, and adjusted 
permit issuance in the single-family sector—a  more reliable indicator of the underlying 
pace of housing construction than starts—has trended down since last fall.  With the 
3¾ percent decline in June, the number of permits issued  slumped to a level 15 percent 
below its average in the second quarter of last year.  The backlog of unused permits also 
has dropped after peaking late last year.  In contrast, construction in the multifamily 
sector has not shown any signs of slowing.  Mul tifamily starts in June were at an annual 
rate of 364,000 units—well within the typi cal range seen since 1995—and the rate of 
permits issued in this se ctor has remained steady. 
 
The pace of home sales has also weakened ove r the past year.   Sales of existing single-
family homes in June were at an annual rate of 5.81 million units, down 8¼ percent from 
their peak in June 2005.  After gaining some  ground in recent m onths, new home sales 
fell 3 percent in June to a pace 17¼ percent lower than the record high posted in July 
2005.   
 
 
 
 
  
 Near-term indicators suggest that housing activity will slow f
 urther in the months ahead.  
Inventories of both new and ex isting homes have been trending up relative to sales for 
some time, and pending home sales—a leading indicator of existing home sales at one- 
and two-month horizons—have remained at low le vels in recent months.  In addition, the 
Michigan index of homebuying attitudes has moved down considerably over the past year.  Survey respondents have pointed to hi gher mortgage rates as the primary reason for 
the deterioration in homebuying conditions.  Since home sales peaked last summer, the 
average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortga ges has risen about 1 percentage point, while 
the average rate for one-year adjustable -rate mortgages has climbed almost 1½ 
percentage points.  House-price appreciation has slowed from the el evated rates
  of recent years.  The rate of 
appreciation shown by the Case-Shiller repe at-sale price index, which controls for the 
quality of homes sold but is confined to sa les in ten large U.S. cities, has moved down

markedly this year to 10 percent over the twelve months ending in May, approximately 
the same rate of appreciation posted in the first quarter by the purchase-only version of 
the existing-homes price index calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight (OFHEO).5  In June, the average price of  existing homes, which has broad 
market coverage but is not quality adjust ed, was up only 1¼ percen t from the level of 
twelve months earlier, and, on a seasonally adju sted basis, this series has hovered around 
the same level since last October.  The rate  of appreciation in ne w-home prices has also 
slowed of late.  The constant-quality pr ice index for new homes—which is the most 
reliable measure of quality-adjusted price appreciation in the new home market—was 
4½ percent higher in the second quarter than in  the same period last year, its smallest 
four-quarter change si nce the spring of 2003.   
 
Equipment and Software  
The gain in real outlays for equipment and soft ware has been solid, on average, so far this 
year, and is similar to its rate of expans ion during 2005.  In the second quarter, real 
outlays for equipment and software edged down at an annual rate of 1 percent after 
surging 15½ percent in the first quarter.  The slower rate of investment spending in the 
second quarter primarily reflected down ward swings in real expenditures on 
communications and transportation equipment that  reversed much of the large run-up in 
the first quarter.   
 
Underlying fundamentals continue to be supportive of increased business investment.  The expansion in business output remains solid.  Decreases in relative prices continue to drive down the cost of capital for high-t ech goods, although not by as much as a few 
years ago.  And, robust growth in profits has furnished the corporate sector with ample 
financial reserves.  Furthermore, surveys of executive sentiment are consistent with these 
solid fundamentals; for example, the capital  spending diffusion index derived from the 
National Association for Business Economics survey remains at a level suggestive of further strong growth in capital spending. 
 
                                                 
5 The cities covered by the Case-Shiller index are Bo ston, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, 
Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington.  The OFHEO price index for existing 
homes—which we think is, on balance, the most reliable overall gauge of house-price appreciation—also 
controls for differences in quality and covers a broa der geographic market than the Case-Shiller index.  
However, the OFHEO index does not re flect the highest and lowest ends of the market because it excludes 
sales financed using jumbo mortgages and mortgages ba cked by the Department of Veterans Affairs and 
the Federal Housing Administration, while the Case-Shiller index includes such purchases.

Real investment in transportation equipment decreased at an annual rate of 22½ percent 
in the second quarter, after an increase of 27½ percent in the fi rst quarter.  Fleet sales of 
new autos and light trucks stepped down to  more-normal levels in the second quarter 
from the lofty pace of the first quarter and dec lined further in July.  In contrast, sales of 
medium and heavy trucks increased in June and have remained at high levels throughout 
the first half of the year.  The current el evated demand for medium and heavy trucks 
appears to stem from new Environmental Pr otection Agency regulations on truck engines 
that are scheduled to take effect in 2007.  There is a large backlog of orders for these 
trucks, and new orders have fallen sharply in recent months as manufacturers have 
reached their capacity to deliver new trucks before the new regulations take effect.  
Domestic outlays on aircraft declined in the second quarter after their sizable increase in the first quarter. 
   
 Real spending on high-tech equipment and softwa re declined at annual rate of 6 percent 
in the s
econd quarter, after their extraordinary increase in the first qua rter.  This reversal 
was led by outlays on communications equipm ent, which fell at an annual rate of 
28 percent in the second quarter after they soar ed at annual rate of 71 percent in the first 
quarter.  A significant fraction of the sw ing in communications equipment spending 
between the first and second quarters likely reflects this year’s mild winter, which 
permitted the outdoor installation of more capit al in the first quarter than is possible 
under more typical seasonal conditions.  In  addition, spending to replace communication 
infrastructure damaged in the hurricanes la st autumn probably began to unwind in the 
second quarter.  Nevertheless, the level of  spending on communications equipment was 
still relatively elevated in  the second quarter, buoyed by outlays by telecommunications 
service providers on fiber-optic networks.  In July, respondents to the CIO Magazine  
quarterly tech poll reported th at they plan to increase  spending on communications 
equipment over the next twelve months, an indi cation that outlays will remain elevated in 
the months ahead.  Meanwhile, real computer  spending increased at  a tepid 6 percent 
annual rate in the second quarter; some purch ases of computers and peripherals probably 
were postponed in anticipation of the release of several new hardware products.  These products include faster and more energy-efficient server s and significantly enhanced 
dual-core processor chips.  Th e growth of real software spending in the second quarter 
was weak as well, increasing at an annual rate of only 2½ percent.
 
 
Real business spending on equipment outsi de of the high-tech and transportation

ries has expanded erratically so far this year.  Outlays in this broad investment

category expanded slowly in the first quarter  before jumping at an annual rate of 
13 percent in the second qua rter; the gains in the sec ond quarter were widespread 
throughout the category.  The already elevated level of unfilled orders for equipment in 
this category, which moved up further in June, suggests that outlays will increase solidly 
in the coming months. 
 
Nonresidential Construction   
Outlays for the construction of nonresidential buildings have moved up at a solid pace so 
far this year, although activity remains well s hort of the level seen before the last 
recession.  Spending on office construction has gained some traction as vacancy rates in 
this sector continue to trend downward.  The commercial construction sector has, on 
balance, posted spending gains in recent mont hs, and vacancy rates in this sector remain 
low by historical standards.  Despite only small decreases in vacancy rates in the industrial sector, expenditures on manufact uring structures have strengthened 
considerably over the past two quarters.  The “other” category of construction—which 
includes construction outlays on health-care, lodging, and educational structures—has registered strong growth recently. 
   
Forward-looking indicators suggest that outla ys for the constructi on of nonresidential 
buildings, excluding drilling and mining structures , will continue to rise over the next few 
quarters but possibly at a more m oderate rate than that seen in the first half of the year.  
The three-month moving average of the arch itectural billings i ndex—a diffusion index 
from the American Institute of Architects —has moved down consider ably since its highs 
of last summer and now shows that the num ber of firms reporting decreases is about 
equal to the number reporting increases.6  The level of the index is well correlated with 
nominal expenditure growth in the nonresidenti al construction sector  and, as the index 
has a lead time of about two quarters, suggest s a leveling-off near the end of the year.  
However, employment for the construction of nonresidential buildings has increased 
during the first six months of the year, a gain  that may point to a more sustained pace of 
construction spending in the months ahead. 
 
Outlays on drilling and mining structures have  continued to climb in response to high 
projected energy prices.  In the first half of 2006, r eal spending in this sector grew at an 
annual rate of 15 percent after increasing 14 percent over the four quarters of 2005.  The 
number of rigs drilling for natural gas and petroleum has increased at a good clip in  
                                                 
6 The architectural billings index includes billings fo r both nonresidential and residential construction 
projects, but a large majority of these proj ects—about 88 percent—is nonresidential.

recent months, an indication that the sector is poised to continue its rapid pace of growth 
in the current quarter. 
 
Business Inventories  
On the basis of available data, we estimate that real nonfarm inventories apart from the 
motor vehicle sector increased at an annual ra te of $58 billion in th e second quarter, up 
slightly from a real increase of  $28 billion in the first quarter.7  The ratio of book-value 
inventories to sales in the manufacturing and trade sect or—excluding motor vehicles—
edged down in May after having remained re latively steady over the previous three 
months, and in June the manufacturing invent ory-to-sales ratio ticked up.  Data from the 
staff’s flow-of-goods inventor y system suggest that—exc luding motor vehicles and 
parts—months’ supply moved lower, on balance, during the first half of the year.  Except 
for paper products, inventories appear to be well aligned with demand.  Moreover, 
business surveys indicate that firms continue to view the level of their customers’ 
inventories as being within a comfortable range. 
 
Federal Government Sector  
The federal budget deficit continued to impr ove as a result of robust growth in tax 
receipts.  According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the deficit over the twelve months ending in June, after routine adjustme nts for payment-timing shifts and financial 
transactions, was $262 billion, compared with an  adjusted deficit of  $335 billion over the 
preceding twelve months.   
 
Tax receipts have been rising faster than nom inal income.  Total receipts in June were 
13 percent above their y ear-earlier level.  Individual in come and social insurance tax 
receipts were 11 percent greater than they were last June, largely because of strong 
nonwithheld taxes that are mostly  quarterly estimated payments on this year’s individual 
tax liability.  Corporate tax pa yments in June, which primarily  reflect estimated quarterly 
payments of corporate tax liability for this year, were 18 percent a bove the year-earlier 
level.  For July, the Daily Treasury Statements indicate that withheld individual and social insurance tax receipts were about 10 percent above their level of a year ago. 
 
Outlays have also been increasing at a rate greater than nominal GDP growth but not as 
quickly as receipts.  Federal outlays in J une, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and  
                                                 
7 This estimate of inventory accumulation in the second quarter is $9 billion higher than the advance 
estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA ) for the quarter because it incorporates data for 
manufacturing inventories in June that were re leased after the BEA’s estimate was calculated.

financial transactions, were 8 percent above th eir year-earlier level.  Net interest outlays 
were 27 percent higher; greater debt and higher interest rates,  including larger inflation 
adjustments on Treasury inflation-protected s ecurities, boosted debt service costs relative 
to those of a year ago.  Non-interest outlays rose 6 percent from thei r level last June; the 
increase was led by spending for defense and particularly for Medicare, which includes 
payments for new Part D prescription drug bene fits.  In contrast to the sharp rise in 
Medicare outlays, Medicaid spending declined, in part because some of the outlays previously made on behalf of Medicaid bene ficiaries are now included in Medicare Part 
D but also because overall Medicaid spending ha s been notably restrained during the past 
year.  In addition, spending by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for 
disaster relief and flood insurance payments —included in the “other” outlays category—
was only a bit above $1 billion in June, well below the $4½ billion monthly average since 
September.

In the NIPA data, total real fe deral purchases declined at an annual rate of 3 percent in 
the second quarter.  Real defense purchases  were only slightly lower in the second 
quarter than in the first quarter.  However,  real nondefense purchases declined at an 
annual rate of 8 percent, primarily because of a step-down in the component of spending 
by FEMA for disaster relief  that is included in NIPA federal purchases.   
 
In July, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) released its Mid-Session Review of 
the budget, which presented an improved outlook for federal deficits relative to the February budget projection.  This improvement is primarily due to greater-than-expected 
individual and corporate tax receipts this spring and to the OMB’s assumption that a 
sizable portion of the upward revision will persist in coming years.  The OMB now projects the fiscal year 2 006 deficit at $296 billion, or 2.3 percent of nominal GDP, down 
a little from last year’s defi cit.  For fiscal 2007, the OMB pr ojects that the deficit will 
increase to $339 billion, or 2.4 percent of  GDP.  Thereafter, the OMB projects that 
deficits will decline to $127 billion, or 0.7 percent of GDP, in fiscal 2011.  The most 
significant policy development indicated in the Mid-Session Review  is the 
Administration’s plan to re quest $110 billion in funding for operations in Iraq and 
Afghanistan in fiscal 2007.

higher than in the preceding twelve months.

State and Local Government Sector  
On the basis of the available data, the staff es timates that real purchases by state and local 
governments increased at an annual rate of about 4½ percent in the second quarter, a 
notably faster pace than in the first quarter.9  Construction spending shot up in June, and 
as a result we now estimate that real state a nd local construction outlays increased at an 
annual rate of 17 percent during the second qua rter.  State and local  spending also was 
boosted by increases in employment averag ing about 25,000 per month during the second 
quarter, somewhat above the average monthly pa ce seen during the previous two years.  
Most of the hiring continued to be done by local governments, but state governments 
contributed modestly to the increases in em ployment in the second quarter after several 
years of almost no growth.  
 
As with the tax collections of  the federal government, the growth of tax receipts by state 
and local governments has been robust and has helped improve the general fiscal position 
of the sector.10  The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local Government 
Tax Revenue indicates that total revenues continued to  increase at a rapid pace in the first 
quarter.11  Personal and corporate tax revenues have soared over the past three quarters 
and have exceeded the high growth rates experienced in the late 1990s and in 2000. 
 
Prices  
Consumer price inflation has continued to move up, on balance, in recent months.  The 
overall PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent during the first six months of 
the year, 1 percentage point faster than in th e twelve months of last  year.  While rising 
energy prices have been a major source of  the increase in overall consumer price 
inflation, the prices of core goods and servic es—particularly housing rents but also other 
core prices—have accelerated as well.  Core PCE prices increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent during the first half  of this year, which is more than ½ percentage point 
higher than during 2005.    
 
Although consumer energy prices declined 0.9 pe rcent in June, PCE energy prices surged 
at an annual rate of about 25 percent over the first half of this year, up from the  
                                                 
9 The June data on state and local construction were released after the BEA’s advance GDP estimate 
for the second quarter.  We estimate that, after incorp orating the June data, real state and local purchases 
grew 1.6 percentage points more than the BEA’s advance second-quarter estimate. 
10 However, the BEA’s annual revision revised down  NIPA estimates of stat e and local net saving, 
suggesting that the sector’s fiscal position in recent years was not as strong as it had appeared previously. 
11 The Census Bureau’s revenue estimates corroborate data from other sources, such as the National 
Association of State Budget Officers and the Rockefeller Institute’s State Revenue Report .

17 percent increase posted in 2005.  Furthermore,  the downturn in energy prices in June 
was transitory:  Spot prices for crude oil moved back up duri ng July to a level near the 
peak for the year; weekly survey data on gasoli ne point to an increase of about 5 percent 
in July in the PCE price index for gasoline,  a rise that would mo re than reverse the 
decline in June.  Although most of the recen t increase in gasoline prices reflected the 
higher cost of crude oil, the margin between retail gasoline prices and crude prices has 
moved up somewhat from an already high leve l despite a 35 percent decline since late 
June in the price of ethanol used for reformulated gasoline.12  The unusually wide margin 
for gasoline has persisted even  though gasoline inventories cu rrently stand near the upper 
end of their seasonal range.  This relatively high level of gasoline inventories may reflect 
some precautionary demand by wholesalers concerned that the hurricane season this year 
could significantly disrupt gasoli ne production as it did last year. 
 
Prices for natural gas turned up in July after falling sharply in the firs t half of the year.  
Abundant supplies caused natural gas prices to  plummet earlier this  year, and the steep 
decline had more than offset the huge run-up in these prices that followed the hurricanes 
last autumn.  However, the heat wave e xperienced by much of the country in July 
boosted the use of natural gas to generate el ectricity for cooling, and natural gas prices 
have moved up considerably in the past few weeks.  Despite the recent surge in demand, however, inventories of natural gas still remain near the high end of their historical range 
for the season.  
 
Consumer food prices rose 0.3 percent in June, a somewhat larger increase than those recorded since January.  The in crease in food prices primar ily reflected a surge in the 
volatile price index for fresh fruits and a rebound in prices for poultry and eggs.  Although the demand for crops and livestock se ems to have been fairly robust, ample 
supplies held down price increases for these commodities.  Current estimates by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) indicate that output of meats and poultry will expand 
more than 3 percent this year, and crop rati ngs indicate that corn and soybean crops are 
currently in good shape.  In contrast, the USDA estimates that the wheat harvest this year 
will probably be about 15 percent less than  in 2005 because of poor growing conditions.  
However, the small share of wheat in the ove rall cost of producing cereal and bakery 
products should limit the upward pressure on consumer food prices.  
                                                 
12 Reformulated gasoline, which is required in many urban areas, contains about 10 percent ethanol.  
While the price of ethanol has declined, the price of  reformulated gasoline remains about 15 cents per 
gallon more than the price of conventional gasoline b ecause transport and blendi ng costs are higher for 
gasoline-ethanol mixes than for conventional gasoline.

Excluding food and energy, core consumer prices acce lerated in the first half of this year.  
Some of the recent pickup in core PCE pr ice inflation came from core goods prices, 
which advanced at an annual rate  of about ½ percent over the fi rst six months of this year 
after edging down in 2005.  Core service prices also contributed importantly to the upturn 
in core PCE price inflation, mostly because of hefty increases in prices of housing 
services—both tenant-occupied  and particularly owner-o ccupied—over recent months.13  
Price increases for core consumer services excluding housing rents have picked up only a 
little since last year; these prices rose at an annual ra te of 3.3 percent in the first six 
months of this year after increasing 3.2 percent in 2005. 
 
It is difficult to estimate how much th e pass-through of higher petroleum prices has 
contributed to the recent acceler ation in core consumer pri ce inflation.  Input costs are 
undoubtedly higher for many businesses, and hi gher energy prices have clearly boosted 
producer prices for energy-intensive intermed iate goods and services, such as industrial 
chemicals, gypsum, concrete, fertilizers, and transportation.  In core consumer prices, 
increases in the prices of transportation services, for which energy costs constitute a 
relatively large share of total input costs, ha ve been particularly sharp.  More broadly, 
energy costs contribute to the overall cost of  a wide range of goods and services, making 
it difficult to identify the specific co ntribution of energy to price inflation. 
 
Most broad measures of price inflation also picked up over the past year.  In the four 
quarters ending last quarter, GDP prices accelerated ½ percentage point from the year-earlier pace.  Excluding food and energy it ems, GDP prices have increased about 
3 percent over the past four quarters, an acce leration of about ¼ per centage point relative 
to the year-earlier pace.   
 
After rising notably in April and May, survey-b ased measures of inflation expectations 
reversed much of their rise in  June and July.  According to the Michigan Survey Research 
Center’s final reading for July, median inflation expectations for the coming year moved down 0.1 percentage point, to 3.2 percent, whic h is about ¾ percenta ge point below its 
recent peak in May.
14  Median five- to ten- year inflation expectati ons were 2.9 percent in  
                                                 
13 The increase in the measure of owners’ equivalent  rent in June remained well above its pace earlier 
in the year, but it was below the very large increase recorded in May.  In addition, measures of rents for 
both tenant-occupied and owner-occupied dwellings advanced at comparable rates in June.  In contrast, housing rents in predominantly owner-occupied neighborhoods had been increasing faster than rents in other areas during April and May. 
14 However, the Michigan survey’s final reading in July was 0.1 percentage point higher than its 
preliminary reading.

July, down ¼ percentage point from the ra te recorded in May.  The upswing through 
May, as well as the subsequent decline in these measures of expectations, is broadly 
consistent with the large, ener gy-related swings in top-line in flation so far this year.  By 
comparison, as of August 2, inflation compen sation implied by the rate spreads between 
nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury bonds was a bit above 2½ percent for both five- and 
ten-year maturities, roughly the same as at  the times of the Ma y and June Greenbooks.  
 
At earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core intermediate 
materials rose 0.8 percent in June after having moved up 1.1 percent in the preceding 
month.  Over the six months ending in June, core  intermediate materials prices rose at an 
annual rate of 7¾ percent, compared with an increase of 4¾ percent in 2005.  Energy 
prices undoubtedly account for a substantial part  of these increases in core intermediate 
materials prices, but rising import prices, hi gher domestic rates of  capacity utilization, 
and strong global demand for many of these mate rials have probably al so contributed to 
the acceleration in prices of core intermediate materials. 
 
The PPI for core crude materials rose at an an nual rate of 37 percent in the first half of 
this year, compared with an increase of 5¼ percent in 2005.  Si nce the PPI pricing date in 
mid-June, commodity prices have moved up a bit further.  Most notably, prices for 
industrial metals have continued to  rise in recent weeks, with the Journal of Commerce  
(JOC) metals index up 7 percent since the time of the June Greenbook.  Among the broad 
commodity indexes, the JOC industrial i ndex, which includes a substantial energy 
component, and the Commodity Research Bur eau spot industrials index, which excludes 
energy items, have both increased about 2 perc ent since the time of  the June Greenbook.  
 
Labor Costs  
Over the three months ending in June, th e employment cost index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation of private industry workers rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, a pickup of 0.8 percentage point from the gain repor ted in the preceding three-month period.  
However, the twelve-month change in the ECI was 2.8 percent in June, about 
¼ percentage point less than the incr ease over the precedi ng twelve months. 
 
The wages and salaries component of the ECI rose 2.8 percent during the twelve months ending in June, ¼ percentage point more than the increase over the ye ar-earlier period.  In 
contrast, benefit costs rose 2.7 percent dur ing the twelve months ending in June, a 
slowdown of about 2 percentage points since the previous year.  Much of the slowdown 
in benefit costs reflects a substantially sm aller increase in firms’ contributions to

retirement and saving programs and a d ecline in nonproduction bonuses.  In addition, 
increases in employer costs for health insura nce slowed to 5.2 per cent over the twelve 
months ending in June from 6.3 pe rcent during the previous year. 
 
Using the most recent NIPA data, the staff estimates that compensation per hour in the 
nonfarm business sector rose at  annual rates of about 5½ pe rcent in the second quarter 
and 5¾ percent over the past four  quarters.  This four-quarter  change is up considerably 
from the revised gain of 4 percent posted in the preceding year.  Unit labor costs are 
estimated to have moved up at an annual rate  of about 3½ percent in the second quarter, a 
bit faster than the 3 percent in crease posted over the past year. 

Appendix 
II-A-1 Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 
 
The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 28, 
affected data back to the beginning of 2003.  Although this year’s revision mainly reflected the 
incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Anal ysis (BEA) of more-comprehensive source data, 
including data from tax records and economic surv eys, the BEA also introduced three noteworthy 
methodological changes.  First, the BEA began us ing the Board’s industrial production index for 
computers as an input for constructing estimates of  computer investment in the years after the 
latest available Annual Survey of Manufacturer s (ASM), which is currently for 2004.  This 
adjustment was intended to address the large downw ard revisions to computer investment that 
occurred in the current and last several annua l revisions.  Second, the BEA now includes 
hospitals and nursing homes among the categories in PCE services that use the Quarterly Services 
Survey as source data.  Finally, the BEA began estimating the value of new light trucks using 
data from J.D. Power and Associates  on actual transaction prices. 
 
On a four-quarter-change basis, the growth rate  of real GDP was revised down 0.3 percentage 
point in 2003, 0.4 percentage point in 2004, and 0.1 percentage point in 2005.  Personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) were revised down slightly, on average, but the largest 
downward revisions were to investment outlays for equipment and software and to government expenditures.  The downward revisions to spending  on equipment and software were the result of 
updated information from the ASMs for 2003 and 2004 and were concentrated in spending on 
computers and peripheral equipment.  The downw ard revisions to real government spending 
reflected updates from various data sources and affected both federal and state and local 
expenditures.  Partially offsetting these downward revisions were small upward revisions to residential investment and the arithmetic contri bution of net exports to real GDP growth.   
 
The BEA also revised its price indexes.  The av erage change in the GDP price index was revised 
up 0.2 percentage point per year from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter of 2005.  
Core PCE inflation was revised up 0.1 percentage  point in 2003, was unchanged in 2004, and was 
revised up 0.1 percentage point in 2005.  Core market-based PCE inflation was unchanged in 
2003 and 2004 and was revised up 0.1 percentage point in 2005.  In 2003, the upward revision to 
core PCE inflation was the result of changes in nonmarket prices (specifically, health insurance).  
In 2005, revisions to both core indexes primarily  reflected new estimates of prices of hospital and 
nursing home services that resulted from incorporating revisions to the producer price indexes for 
these components. 
 
On the income side of the accounts, the growth rate of gross domestic income from the fourth 
quarter of 2002 to the first quarter of 2006 was revised down, on average, by approximately the same amount as was the average growth rate of GDP.  As a result, in the first quarter of 2006, the 
statistical discrepancy was little changed.  The gr owth rate of real disposable personal income 
II-A-2 
was revised up slightly, on average, over the same  period, in part because of upward revisions to 
dividend income.  Furthermore, personal ou tlays were revised down—largely because of 
downward revisions to PCE—and thus the personal saving rate was revised up 0.4 percentage 
point in the first quarter of this year.  Corpor ate economic profits were revised down, on average, 
over the three-year period of the revision, although the contour of rising profits over this period 
was maintained.  The downward revisions to prof its were due primarily to larger estimates of 
economic depreciation. 
 
The annual revision also provided information a bout the magnitude of upcoming revisions to 
measures of productivity and compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector.  We estimate 
that the four-quarter change in real output per hour will be revised down 0.4 percentage point in 
2003 and 0.7 percentage point in 2004 and will be revised up 0.1 pe rcentage point in 2005.  In 
addition, we estimate that the change in compensa tion per hour from the fourth quarter of 2002 to 
the fourth quarter of 2005 will be little changed, on average, but that the pattern of growth will be 
much smoother.  Most notably, we estimate that, instead of a sharp deceleration in compensation 
per hour from 2004 to 2005, the revised data will show compensation per hour increasing at about 
4 percent in both years.1  Together, these revisions also impl y a smoother pattern of growth in 
unit labor costs in 2004 and 2005, with revised estimates showing increases of about 1-¾ percent 
in both years. 
 
                                                      
1 Expected revisions to the 2004 and 2005 four-quarter growth rates of compensation per hour stem 
largely from revisions to the BEA’s estimates of wages and salaries, which derive in turn from a change in 
the BEA’s seasonal adjustment procedures to take into account the number of Fridays—the most popular payday—in a quarter.  For example, the presence of fo urteen Fridays in the four th quarter of 2004 meant 
that wages and salaries were likely boosted by the higher-than-typical number of paydays in the quarter.  By taking this source of increase into account, the BEA reduced the seasonally adjusted increase in 
compensation per hour in that quarter, lowering the 20 04 four-quarter change and raising the four-quarter 
change in 2005.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
The expected path of the federal funds ra te shifted down over the intermeeting period.  
Market participants apparently interpre ted FOMC communications, some softer-than-
expected economic readings, heightened geopol itical tensions, and hi gher oil prices as 
portending a more appreciable moderation in economic growth.  Nominal Treasury yields 
dropped in line with the decline in policy exp ectations.  Inflation-i ndexed yields fell by 
amounts similar to their nominal counterpar ts, despite somewhat higher-than-expected 
readings on consumer prices, so that inflation compensati on implied by Treasury yields 
was little changed over the inte rmeeting period.  Equity prices moved up slightly, buoyed 
by greater prospects for a near-term end to  policy tightening.  Spreads for speculative-
grade corporate bonds inched hi gher, but corporate bond spread s generally remained low, 
as indicators of near-term corpor ate credit quality continued to  be favorable.  Recent data 
suggest that household financial cond itions have also remained solid. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision at the June FOMC meeting to in crease the target federal funds rate 25 basis 
points was largely anticipated by market participants.  However, the accompanying 
statement stressing the dependence of polic y decisions on incoming economic data and 
the release of the June meeting minutes—which noted that the Committee saw inflation as likely to edge lower—re portedly led market particip ants to revise down their 
expectations for the path of monetary policy.  The Chairman’s monetary policy  testimony 
prompted a further downward revision, as inve stors reportedly focused on references to 
“moderation” in economic growth, lags in the effects of previous policy actions, and the 
dependence of future policy decisions on incomi ng data.  The odds of a quarter-point rate 
hike at the August FOMC meeting fell, on net,  from nearly 70 percent to about 30 percent 
over the intermeeting period.  The Desk’s survey  indicates that primary dealers see closer 
to even odds of a hike in August.  The expect ed level of the nominal federal funds rate at 
the end of this year shif ted down about 15 basis points and moved down even more 
further out.  Policy uncertainty, as inferred from Eurodollar-implied volatilities, moved 
up slightly over the intermeeting period but  remained low by historical standards. 
 On net, two- and ten-year nominal Treasur y yields declined 34 and 30 basis points, 
respectively, over the intermeeting period.  (Relative to the June Greenbook, Treasury 
yields fell less—25 and 21 basis points, resp ectively.)  Despite th e higher-than-expected 
June CPI data, yields on Treasur y inflation-protected securitie s moved about in line with 
those on their nominal counterpa rts, leaving inflation comp ensation little changed.  The 
short- and long-term measures of inflati on expectations from the Michigan survey—

while little changed from their June va lues—were down significantly from the May 
readings.  
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Over the intermeeting period, heightened geopoliti cal tensions and the associated rise in 
oil prices appeared to weigh on equity market s.  However, these effects were countered 
by investor reaction to FOMC communications , particularly the June FOMC statement 
and the Chairman’s congressional testimony, which were taken as suggesting reduced 
odds of further monetary policy tightening.  Despite some notable negative earnings 
surprises that induced sizable stock price de clines for a handful of prominent firms, 
second-quarter earnings reports were not accompanied by much in the way of negative 
guidance, and, on balance, were about a wash for the stock market.  Broad equity market 
indexes rose about 2 to 3 percent,  on net, over the intermeeting period. 
 The equity risk premium—measured by the spread between the twelve-month forward 
trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 fi rms and a real long-run Treasury yield—
widened slightly but remained near 3 percen tage points.  Implie d volatility on the S&P 
500 declined slightly, on net, over the in termeeting period, but remained above the 
extraordinarily low average levels of the past year.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds generally fell in line with Treasury rates 
over the intermeeting period, implying little change in their spreads.  Yields on 
speculative-grade bonds fell by less, leaving their spreads over comparable-maturity 
Treasury rates a bit higher but st ill relatively low by historical  standards.  Risk spreads on 
commercial paper, measured by the difference between yields on thirty-day A2/P2 paper 
and A1/P1 paper, remained low.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With about three quarters of S&P 500 firm s having reported to date, second-quarter 
earnings per share are estimated to have increas ed about 15 percent from a year earlier, a 
pace similar to that of the past several quart ers.  While the energy sector again logged the 
largest gains, four-quarter gains continue d to be spread among all major sectors.  
Through mid-July, analysts’ revisions to fo recasted year-ahead earnings for the S&P 500 
companies were offsetting, leaving the year-ahead revisions index near zero. 
 
Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms remained solid.  Boosted by continued 
robust earnings, balance sheet liquidity has stayed high, while corporate leverage has

remained very low.  Despite $28 billion of GM bonds being downgraded, the pace of 
bond rating upgrades nearly matched that of do wngrades in the second quarter.  The six-
month trailing bond default rate fell again in  June, to a very low level.  Meanwhile, 
expected year-ahead defaults, based on the KMV model, were unchanged and quite low, 
an indication that strong aggregate credit qua lity is viewed as likely to persist over the 
near term.  
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms, boosted by especially strong speculative-
grade issuance, remained r obust in June but slowed some in July.  Outstanding 
commercial paper and C&I loans also increased at  a rapid clip in June, then slowed last 
month.  In sum, net debt financing has been strong in recent months, on average, despite 
the dip in July.  Reported uses of bond pro ceeds and responses to July’s Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac tices indicate that firms have borrowed 
largely to finance mergers and acquisitions and investment in plant and equipment.  In June, both seasoned equity offerings and IP Os were in line with the past year’s 
moderate pace, but IPOs dried up in July when several issues  were withdrawn.  However, 
the backlog of filings suggests that IPOs could resume their modest pace.  Moreover, our 
indicators suggest th at private equity issuance, whic h includes equity investments by 
buyout firms and venture capital, has c ontinued to outpace public issuance. 
 Still, the amount of gross issuance pale s in comparison with the pace of equity 
retirements, resulting in a shar p contraction of net equity i ssuance.  In the second quarter, 
retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions, boosted by leveraged buyouts, were not far off the scorching first-quarter pace, and share repurchases seem to have 
remained near the record pace set in the fourth quarter—trends supported by continued 
strong profits, favorable debt  financing terms, and ample cash on corporate balance 
sheets.  With recent announcements indicating that both share repurchases and cash mergers are not about to abat e, net equity is likely to continue contracting rapidly. 
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage borrowing remained str ong in the second quarter, leaving the level 
of commercial mortgage debt 15 percent above its year-ago reading.  The issuance 
calendar for commercial mortgage-backed s ecurities (CMBS) suggests a moderation in 
the pace of borrowing in the third quarter.  Th is slowing is probably due to rising interest 
rates for commercial mortgages, which climbed in May to their highe st level since mid-

2002.  Spreads of rates on investment-grade  CMBS over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasuries held steady over the intermee ting period and remained quite narrow.  
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages, including those backing CMBS, remained 
low by historical standards through the first qua rter.  A decline in vacancy rates and some 
firming in rents in the current quarter i ndicate continued improvement in market 
fundamentals.  The ratio of net operating income to property pr ices, an indicator of the rate of return on 
commercial real estate properties, declined s lightly in the second quarter.  The spread of 
this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough measure of the risk premium on 
commercial real estate assets, narrowed so mewhat to its lowest reading since 1992. 
 
Household Finance 
Average interest rates on both thirty-year  fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgages decreased slightly  over the intermeeting period but remained well above the 
levels posted earlier this year.  Household mortgage debt expanded rapidly in the first 
quarter, but the higher mortga ge rates and a cooling hous ing market suggest that 
borrowing likely decelerated a bit in the sec ond quarter.  In May, consumer credit was 
only modestly above its year-earlier level, as nonrevolving consumer credit has remained 
particularly sluggish.  The financial obligations ratio edged up in the fi rst quarter to a level just above the top of 
its historical range.  Nonetheless, the eviden ce to date suggests that most households are 
not having problems meeting those obligations .  Delinquency rates on credit cards, auto 
loans, and prime residential mortgages have  stayed low in recent months.  However, 
delinquency rates on subprime mortgages—esp ecially those with variable rates—have 
risen, on net, since the middle of last year .  The pace of bankruptcy filings remained 
damped over the intermeeting period—perhap s because the new regime imposes higher 
costs on filers.  Stock prices and the available information on ho me prices suggest a slight decline in the 
ratio of net worth to dispos able personal income last qu arter.  Reflecting low stock 
returns of late, domestic equity mutual funds  recorded net redemptions the past three 
months, while inflows to intern ational equity funds moderate d substantially in June and 
July.

Treasury and Agency Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury De partment auctioned two- and five-year 
nominal securities and ten- and twenty-year TIPS.  Demand at the auctions was fairly 
strong, although the proportions of securities awarded to indi rect bidders—a category that 
includes foreign central banks—w ere generally lower than the historical average.  In 
addition, Treasury securities held in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
on behalf of foreign accounts fell modestly over the intermeeting period.  These indicators are consistent with  a continuing downward trend in  foreign participation since 
2004.  Indeed, Treasury data released this m onth confirmed declining foreign-investor 
participation rates in auct ions during May and June. 
 In its quarterly refunding statement, the Tr easury Department announced that it will offer 
$44 billion in new securities between Augus t and October, an amount unchanged from 
the same period last year.  The Treasury al so announced that it will begin auctioning 
thirty-year bonds—sold semiannually now—at a quarterly frequency starting in February 
2007.  Yields on thirty-year bonds rose a fe w basis points following the announcement. 
 On July 20, the Federal Reserve implemented revisions to its Payments System Risk 
policy.  Under the new rules, government-sponsor ed enterprises (GSEs) and certain other 
institutions may no longer fund principal and interest payments  with daylight overdrafts 
in their Fed accounts—overdrafts  that had previously reache d as much as $110 billion.  
To date, the new policy has not caused any di scernible disruptions in funding markets, 
nor has it had a measurable effect on the market’s willingness to hold GSE debt.  Even amid comments from officials at the Treasury Department and the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight that critic ized the size of the GSEs’ portfolios and 
Chairman Bernanke’s remarks in congression al testimony regarding regulatory reform, 
GSE stock prices generally tracked the favorable  performance of financ ial-sector stocks.  
Meanwhile, spreads between rates on long-te rm agency debt and those on Treasury 
securities were roughly unchanged, on net, desp ite a temporary jump perhaps related to a 
large issue of new on-the-r un Freddie Mac benchmark bonds. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds rose sharply in the second quarter, as 
advance-refunding issues held near the first- quarter pace, and new capital issuance—led 
by the education and housing sectors—surged.  Issues for advance refunding and new 
capital projects fell back from the second- quarter pace in July but remained robust.

The credit quality of municipal bonds has remained strong.  The number of bonds with 
rating upgrades far outpaced the number with  rating downgrades in the second quarter, 
and rating changes were more balanced in July.  In addition, th e ratio of yields on 
municipal bonds to those on Treasuries, an a lternative credit quality measure, increased 
slightly over the intermeeting peri od, but the level remained low. 
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at an annual rate  of about 5 percent in June and July, a pace similar to the 
average during the first five months of the year.  The growth of M2 was held down in 
July by the runoff of funds that had temporarily come into M2 to facilitate the payment of 
corporate taxes in June.  In addition, the oppor tunity cost of holding M2 has inched up 
further in recent months, thereby adding to th e restraint on the growth  of the aggregate. 
 Although commercial bank credit slowed from its  rapid advance earlier in the year, loans 
continued to exhibit robust gr owth in June and July.  Loan s to businesses increased at a 
particularly rapid clip.  Res pondents to the July Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey on 
Bank Lending Practices reported that they ha d eased standards and terms on C&I loans 
somewhat further over the pa st three months.  Residentia l real estate loans on banks’ 
books increased at a very strong pace over the past two months.  Nonetheless, a 
significant net fraction of survey respondent s noted weaker demand for mortgages to 
purchase homes.

Appendix  
 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The July 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  Sp ecial questions in the survey addressed 
domestic banks’ holdings of subprime r esidential mortgages and nontraditional 
residential mortgage products.  In addition, the survey queried domestic banks about the 
change in the demand for residential real estate loans to finance homes for investment 
purposes.  This appendix is based on r esponses from fifty-six domestic banks and 
seventeen foreign banking institutions.  In the July survey, domestic and foreign institutions indicated that they had eased 
lending standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans somewhat 
further. Domestic banks, however, reported th at they had tightened lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans over the previous three months, while foreign banks noted that standards on such loans were uncha nged.  Demand for both C&I and commercial 
real estate loans was reportedly about unchanged in the July survey.  In the household sector, a small net fraction of domestic respondents indicated that they had eased credit standards on residential mortgages over the pr evious three months, while standards and 
terms on consumer loans were reportedly little  changed.  Significant net fractions of 
domestic institutions noted that demand for both mortgages to purchase homes and consumer loans had weakened further.    
Business Lending  
In the July survey, domestic institutions re ported a further easing of standards and terms 
on C&I loans.  On net, about 10 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they had 
eased credit standards on such loans to large and middle-market firms over the previous 
three months, roughly the same percentage as in the April survey.  About 40 percent of domestic institutions—a significantly smaller net fraction than in April—noted that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for such firms.  About one-fifth of domestic banks—a notably smaller net percentage than in the previous survey—
reported that they had reduced the costs of  credit lines, and smaller net fractions of 
domestic respondents indicated that they had eased loan covenants and increased the maximum size of credit lines that they are willing to extend to their business borrowers. 
 Credit standards on C&I loans to small firms were reportedly little changed, on balance, 
in the July survey.  However, about one-fift h of domestic institutions, on net, indicated 
that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for such firms over 
the same period.  Other loan terms were generally little changed.

 III-A-4   
 
 
Almost one-fifth of U.S. branches and agenci es of foreign banks, on net, reported that 
they had eased their standards on C&I loans dur ing the survey period.  Considerable net 
fractions of these institutions also indicat ed that they had eased loan covenants, 
trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost  of funds, and reduced the cost of credit 
lines.      Nearly all domestic and all foreign institu tions that reported having eased their lending 
standards and terms in the July survey pointed to more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most  important reason for having done so.  
Notable net percentages of domestic responde nts also cited increased liquidity in the 
secondary market for these loans, a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, and increased tolerance for risk as reasons for having eased credit standards or terms on 
C&I loans.  Demand for C&I loans was reportedly unchanged, on net, in the July survey at both domestic and foreign institutions.  Among dom estic banks that saw stronger demand for 
C&I loans, almost 90 percent explained the strengthening by pointing to increased needs to finance mergers and acquisitions, while 80 percent cited borrowers’ increased 
needs to finance investment in plant or equipment.  Among domestic institutions that experienced weaker demand for C&I loans, a bout 85 percent attributed the softening to 
borrowers’ decreased needs to finance inv estment in plant or equipment, while 
significant net fractions pointed to increases in  customers’ internally generated funds, 
decreased need for inventory financing, and a shift in customer borrowing to another bank or to nonbank sources of credit.  Rega rding future business, both domestic and 
foreign institutions reported that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers was little changed over the previous three months.  On balance, 10 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had tightened lending 
standards on commercial real estate loans over the previous three months.  By contrast, foreign respondents noted that they had not  changed standards on such loans over the 
same period.  Both domestic and forei gn institutions reported that demand for 
commercial real estate loans was little  changed in the July survey. 
 
Household Lending 
On net, about 10 percent of domestic institutions indicated that they had eased credit standards on residential mortgage loans over the past three months, the same fraction as in the April survey.  In line with other ev idence of a slowdown in housing activity this 
year, domestic institutions reported that demand for mortgages to purchase homes had 
continued to weaken over the previous thr ee months.  About 60 percent of respondents 
 III-A-5   
 
 
saw weaker demand for such loans, a significan tly larger net fraction than in the April 
survey.      Only a few domestic respondents indicated that their willingness to make consumer installment loans had increased over the past three months.  Standards and most terms 
on credit card and non-credit-card consumer lo ans were reportedly little changed in the 
July survey, on balance.  Demand for consum er loans weakened further over the past 
three months:  About 40 percent of domestic banks saw weaker demand for such loans, 
a somewhat larger net fraction than in the April survey.  
 The July survey included a set of special questions on domestic banks´ holdings of subprime residential mortgages and nontraditional residential mortgage products,  as 
well as on changes in the credit quality of such loans.
1  The subprime category of 
residential mortgages includes loans made to borrowers that displayed one or more of 
the following characteristics at the time of loan  origination:  weakened credit histories 
stemming from payment delinquencies, ch arge-offs, judgments, or bankruptcies; 
reduced repayment capacity as measured by cr edit scores or debt-to-income ratios; and 
incomplete credit histories.2  Nontraditional  residential mortgage products include—but 
are not limited to—adjustable-rate mortgag es with multiple payment options, interest-
only mortgages, and "Alt-A" products such as mortgages with limited income verification and mortgages secured by non-owner-occupied properties. 
 Holdings of subprime residential mortgag es were generally small for the respondent 
banks.
  Of the thirty domestic banks with subprime residential mortgages on their 
books, nearly three-fourths indicated that such mortgages accounted for less than 5 
percent of their residential mortgages, and one-fifth of institutions noted that the share 
of such products was between 5 percent a nd 15 percent.  The remainder of banks 
reported a share that was more than 20 percen t.  When the responses were weighted by 
dollar volume, banks that reported a share of less than 5 percent accounted for nearly  60 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of those banks that responded to 
this special question on subprime residential mortgages at the end of the first quarter.  Those institutions that reported a share be tween 5 percent and 15 percent accounted for 
22 percent of all such mortgages.    
                                                 
 1 The number of banks that responded to the set of special questions varied from 
twenty-nine to forty-eight depending on the questi on.  According to first-quarter Call Reports, 
the respondent banks accounted for between 53 per cent and 63 percent of all residential real 
estate loans on the books of domestic commercial banks as of March 31, 2006. 
 2  In considering subprime residential mortgages,  banks were instructed to include first-
lien loans only. 
 III-A-6   
 
 
A modest net fraction of respondents indicated that the quality of their subprime 
residential real estate portfolios—as measured by delinquencies and charge-offs—had deteriorated somewhat over the past twel ve months, a response consistent with 
aggregate measures suggesting some deteri oration in subprime loan performance in 
recent quarters. Nonetheless, three institutions reported that the quality of their portfolios of such products had performed so mewhat better than they had expected over 
that period, while only one bank noted that the quality of its portfolio had performed 
somewhat worse than anticipat ed.  A few institutions indicated that they had tightened 
price-related terms and credit standards on such mortgages over the same period.  Looking forward, about one-third of respondent s reported that they anticipate that the 
quality of the subprime residential mortgag es currently on their books will deteriorate 
somewhat over the next twelve months, and the rest expect loan quality to likely stabilize around current levels.  The panel banks had more-substa ntial holdings of residential mortgages that could be 
categorized as nontraditional.  Among the fort y-eight domestic banks that responded to 
this special question, about 45 percent re ported that the share of such mortgages 
currently on their books was less than 5 per cent, and about 20 percent of respondents 
noted that the share of such products was between 5 percent and 15 percent.  Seven 
institutions, however, indicated that nontra ditional mortgage products accounted for 
more than 30 percent of the residential mortgages currently on their books. When the 
responses were weighted by dollar volume, banks that reported a share of less than 5 percent accounted for 10 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of those banks that responded to this special ques tion on nontraditional residential mortgage 
products at the end of the first quarter.  T hose institutions that reported a share between 
5 percent and 15 percent accounted for more th an 50 percent of all such mortgages.  
The seven institutions that indicated a shar e greater than 30 percent accounted for less 
than 10 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of the respondents.
3 
 A modest net percentage of respondents indicated that the quality of their portfolio of nontraditional residential mortgage pr oducts—as measured by delinquencies and 
charge-offs—had improved over the past twelve  months.  Eight banks reported that the 
quality of their portfolios of such produc ts had performed better than had been 
expected, and only one institution indicated  that the quality of its portfolio had 
                                                 
 3 A similar question was included in the July 2005 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. 
 In that survey, about one-third of domestic re spondents indicated that the share of nontraditional 
mortgage products on their books was less than 5 pe rcent, and another one-third reported that the 
share of such products was between 5 percent and 15 percent.  These shares were roughly similar 
if the responses are weighted by the respondent  banks’ dollar volume of residential mortgages 
outstanding in the first quarter of 2005. 
 III-A-7   
 
 
performed somewhat worse than had been anticipated.  Nonetheless, about 10 percent 
of institutions, on balance, noted that they  had tightened price-related terms on such 
mortgage products.  Looking forward, nearly 30 percent of banks, on net, indicated that 
they expect the quality of the nontraditional residential mortgage products currently on 
their books will deteriorate somewhat over the next twelve months.  These banks 
accounted for more than 50 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of respondents at the end of the first quarter.  The July survey also included a special qu estion on changes in demand for residential 
real estate loans used to fina nce homes for investment purposes.
4  Almost 20 percent of 
domestic institutions reported stronger dema nd for such loans over the past twelve 
months, while 30 percent noted that demand had weakened over the same period.

In May, the value of exports of goods and serv ices rose 2.4 percent af ter a flat April.  
Exports rose across almost all major product ca tegories, with exports  of capital goods and 
consumer goods showing the largest gains.  Within capital goods, there was a large 
increase in exports of aircraft.  Exports of  automotive products moved down slightly, and 
services exports increased somewhat. 
 
The average value of exports in April and Ma y increased 8.7 percent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter.  Exports of fuels, chemicals, se miconductors, and telecommunications equipment 
were particularly strong.  In real terms, according to the advance NIPA release, which 
includes the BEA’s estimate of  nominal trade in June, e xports of goods and services 
increased 3.3 percent (a.r.) in the second quart er, following a rise of 14 percent in the first 
quarter. 
 
The value of imported goods and services ro se 1.8 percent in May from a high April 
level.  The increase in imports was heavily concentrated in oil, reflecting both higher

prices and quantities, with ot her categories of imports falli ng on balance.  Imports of non-
oil industrial supplies declined, led by a sharp decline in the value of imported natural 
gas.  Imports of automotive products also fe ll sharply in May.  Im ports of capital goods 
were basically flat, with incr eases in several categories of machinery offsetting declines 
in computers and semiconductors.  Imports of c onsumer goods were also flat.  Imports of 
services rose moderately. 
 
The average value of imports in April and Ma y increased 5.5 percent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter.  Imports of oil were particularly st rong, primarily reflecting higher prices.  In 
contrast, imports of automotive products de clined, and imports of consumer goods and 
industrial supplies were little changed.  In the advance NIPA release, real imports of good 
and services rose only 0.2 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, following a rise of 9.1 
percent in the first quarter. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In June, import prices of non-oil goods and core goods rose 0.4 and 
0.6 percent, respectively.  After increasing 3 percent in  May, prices for non-fuel 
industrial supplies rose  another 2.4 percent in June, pr imarily reflecting a 7.3 percent 
increase in prices for unfinished metals.  (This increase in metals prices followed a 
8.5 percent increase in May.)  Prices of importe d finished goods also rose in June, albeit 
to a much smaller extent.  Prices for imported capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) were up 0.5 percent.  Pri ces for automotive products and consumer 
goods were also higher, increa sing 0.2 and 0.1 percent, respec tively.  Prices for imported 
computers fell 0.3 percent, whereas prices for semiconductors rose 0.6 percent. 
 
In the second quarter, according to the adva nce NIPA release, core import prices rose 
3¾ percent at an annual rate, mostly reflect ing an increase in prices for non-fuel 
industrial supplies.  In a ddition, prices for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and automotive products were up slightly. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil fell 1. 4 percent in June.  In July, the spot price 
of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude o il averaged around $74.50 pe r barrel, up nearly 
5 percent from June on increased fears of s upply disruptions.  The spot price closed at 
$75.82 per barrel on August 2, down about $1 per barre l from its peak in mid-July.  Fears 
that the conflict between Israel and Lebanon could widen, increased tensions over Iran’s 
nuclear program, an escalation of violence in Iraq, reduced Saudi oil production, and

concerns that Tropical Storm Chris will strengt hen and enter the Gulf of Mexico have all 
put upward pressure on oil prices .  In addition, rebel attacks a nd a pipeline leak in Nigeria 
have reduced oil production. 
 Exports.   In June, prices of U.S. exports of  total goods and core goods increased 0.8 and 
0.9 percent, respectively.  Prices for n
onagricultural industria l supplies increased 
1.9 percent in June, on higher prices for metals and chemicals.  Agricultural export prices 
rose 2.4 percent.  Within finished goods , the most notable price increase was a 
0.3 percent rise for consumer goods.  Prices  for automotive products and capital goods 
(excluding computers and semiconductors) increa sed 0.1 percent.  In contrast, prices of 
exported computers and semiconductors fell 0.5 and 0.1 percent, respectively. 
 In the second quarter, according to the advan ce N
 IPA release, core export prices rose 
6½ percent (a.r.), as prices increased in all sub-categories.  The increase in prices for 
nonagricultural industrial supplie s was the main contributor to  the overall price increase.  
In addition, export prices for capital goods  (excluding computers and semiconductors) 
continued to increase at a moderate pace. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International

Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities surged in May (line 4) after weak net 
inflows in April.  There were strong flows into Treasury securities (line 4a) in May, 
although private foreigners have still on net sold Treasury securities in 2006.  Private 
foreign purchases of agency bonds rose to an extremely high level in May (line 4b), 
bringing the total for the first five months n ear that for all 2005.  Foreign purchases of 
U.S. corporate bonds (line 4c) maintained the healthy average pace of  recent months. The 
large debt inflows in May were primarily r ecorded against Japan, as well as the United 
Kingdom and Caribbean financia l centers.  Monthly transa ctions data are recorded 
against the country of first transactor, however , so transactions data  for the two financial 
centers provide little informa tion about the residence of the ultimate foreign counterparty.  
Flows into corporate stocks (line 4d) show ed a second month of weakness, although year-
to-date inflows remain sizable relative to historical levels.   
 
U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) picked up in May, and year-to-date purchases are slightly above la st year’s robust pace.  Flows into foreign bonds (line 5a) 
neared record monthly levels, while purchases of stocks (line 5b) eas ed a bit.  Some of 
this easing is due to large net sales of Japane se equities by U.S. investors, counter to the 
recent trend of strong U.S. demand for Asian equities. 
 
Inflows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) were significant in May, but retreated 
from the unusually large level of inflows in April.  This  volatility is not unusual, 
however, as the magnitude and direction of banking flows often vary significantly from 
month to month.

Over the intermeeting period, the major currenc ies index of the dollar’s value declined 
1¼ percent on balance.  The dollar deprec iated following the June FOMC announcement 
and on the release of the U.S. June employ ment report, but appreciated as market 
participants revised down their expectations for the pace of monetary policy tightening in 
Canada and Japan and on highe r-than-expected data on U.S. core consumer prices.  The 
dollar subsequently depreciated following th e release of the Beige Book and U.S. Q2 
GDP data.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar appreciated 1 percent against the Canadian 
dollar, but depreciated 4 percen t against sterling, 2 percent ag ainst the euro, and 1 percent 
against the yen.  The dollar’s appreciation ag ainst the Canadian dollar occurred after the 
Bank of Canada signaled in early July that it would not resume its monetary tightening in 
coming months and after the re lease of weaker-than-expect ed Canadian GDP for May.  
The dollar’s depreciation agai nst sterling was attributed to  the release of higher-than-
expected U.K. consumer prices for June a nd a 25-basis-point surp rise increase in the 
Bank of England’s policy rate on August 3.  The volatility of the dollar-euro and yen-
dollar exchange rates implied by option prices remained close to historically low levels. 
 
Equity indexes in major indus trial countries were quite vo latile over the intermeeting 
period, edging up slightly on balance in Europe  and Japan.  Global eq uity indexes rose 
following the June FOMC announcement, declin ed in mid-July on the worsening conflict 
in the Middle East and higher oil prices, a nd rose again following Chairman Bernanke’s 
delivery of the Monetary Policy Report a nd on growing beliefs that the conflict in 
Lebanon and Israel would not spread to other parts of the Middle East.  Share prices in 
the technology sector underperformed broad ma rket indexes, as there were disappointing 
earnings reports and warnings by severa l leading global technology companies. 
 
The yield on the ten-year government bond in Canada declined 30 basis points, 
comparable to that in the United States, but yields moved down only about 10 basis points in the euro area and 3 basis point in Japan.  Realized volatility of ten-year 
government bonds was little changed in most industrial economies over the intermeeting 
period.  Inflation compensation implied by the difference between long-term nominal 
yields and yields on inflation-indexed notes was little change d on net in the euro area and 
Japan, but increased slightly in the United Kingdom, consistent w ith the higher-than-
expected U.K. consumer prices in June.

The dollar depreciated against several emer ging market currencies over the intermeeting 
period.  The dollar depreciated 3½ percent agai nst the Mexican peso on net, and Mexican 
financial indicators surged in early July after Felipe Calderon appeared to win the 
presidential election.  Subs equently, the outcome of the election was challenged by 
runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, but there was only a muted reaction in 
Mexican financial markets.  The Mexican st ock market index rose  11 percent over the 
intermeeting period, and Mexico’s EMBI+ spread s declined 24 basis points.  Other Latin 
American and emerging Asian equity prices took their cue from the fluctuations in 
industrial country equity  prices; on net, they rose 2 to  7½ percent.  EMBI+ spreads for 
most emerging market economies declined; Br azil’s and Argentina’s spreads declined 30 
basis points and 46 basis points, respectively.   
 Since the June FOMC meeting, the spot price of gold has in creased about 11 percent.  
The spot price of gold peaked above $660 per ounce on July 14, as m 
arket participants 
were concerned that the conflict in Lebanon and Israel might spread to other countries in 
the region (the spot price of WTI crude oil also reached a new all-time high on that day), 
but fell back late in the intermeeting period.  Other precious and indus trial metals prices 
also gained over the intermeeting period, and their daily fluctuations largely mirrored those of the price of gold.  
  The Desk did not intervene during 
the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Recent data point to a pick-up in economic growth in Europe and Japan in the second 
quarter but show that growth slowed somewh at in Canada from its  rapid first-quarter 
pace.  Business sentiment remains at high levels in the major economies, and labor-
market conditions have continued to improve , suggesting that there is considerable 
economic momentum abroad despite higher energy prices and tightening financial 
conditions. 
 
Inflation in the advanced foreign economies has been boosted by higher oil prices.  
Twelve-month inflation was 2½ percent in June in the euro area, the United Kingdom and Canada, above their targets of 2 percent.  Ho wever, core inflation in those economies was 
well below 2 percent.  Responding to infl ation concerns, the ECB and the Bank of 
England raised policy interest  rates ¼ percentage point on August 3.  In Japan, positive 
inflation and further indications of economic st rength led the Bank of Japan in July to end 
its five-year-old zero interest rate policy wi th a ¼ point hike in the overnight rate.   
 
Monthly indicators for Japan  suggest a pick-up in economic growth in the second 
quarter driven by investment spending.  Pr oduction of capital goods rose 7.4 percent in 
the second quarter, while core machinery orde rs in April and May rose 6.3 percent from 
their first-quarter level.  The Bank of Japan’s June Tankan survey also pointed to healthy investment demand; the diffusion index of bus iness conditions for fi rms of all sizes and 
industries rose to 6, and large firms reporte d that they planned to increase capital 
spending 11.6 percent in the current fiscal year.  Indicators of demand in other sectors appeared less strong.  Although average real  spending by households rose 0.6 percent in 
the second quarter, new car registrations fe ll 3.6 percent and averag e retail sales were 
slightly below their first-quarter level.  The real merchandise trade balance rebounded 
after a sharp dip in April, but the external sector seemed set to make only a weak contribution to growth as average exports ro se only 1.4 percent over the second quarter.  
  
Core consumer prices (which exclude fres h food but include ener gy) in the Tokyo area 
were flat in July but were 0.4 percent higher than a year ago.  Core consumer prices for 
the country as a whole were 0.6 percent higher in June than a year earlier, while core 
consumer prices excluding both fresh food and energy were only 0.2 percent higher.  
Nominal wages rose 0.1 percent in June compared  with a year earlier, as the labor market

continued to improve.  Although the unemployment rate  rose two-tenths to 4.2 percent in 
June, the rise seemed primarily due to workers quitting to seek better jobs.  The offers-to-
applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings rela tive to the number of 
officially registered job seek ers) reached a 14-year high.   
 
The Bank of Japan ended its zero interest rate policy in July,  raising the target rate for 
overnight call loans to 0.25 per cent.  The Bank also lifted the official discount rate from 
0.1 percent to 0.4 percent.  The moves were widely expected following the upbeat results 
of the Tankan business survey released one week earlier; however, interest rates fell 
about 7 basis points across maturities as the Bank signaled its intent to proceed cautiously.  The Bank had some difficulties keeping overnight rates near its target over 
the first week of the new policy, but the market has settled down and rates have since been close to the target level. 
  
Data for the euro area  suggest that economic growth wa s strong in the second quarter.  
Euro-area industrial production rose 1.6 percent in May, led by a 2½ percent increase in 
the production of capital goods.  Industrial pr oduction for April and May on average was 
0.6 percent higher than the first- quarter average.  Belgium, th e first euro-area country to 
release second-quarter GDP da ta, showed economic growth at a 3.2 percent pace, a 
stronger-than-expected performa nce that could bode well for the euro area as a whole. 
 
Data on consumer spending generally are consis tent with continued growth.  The average 
volume of euro-area retail sale s rose 0.5 percent in June fr om the previous month and 
0.4 percent for the second quarter as a whol e.  French consumption of manufactured 
products capped a strong second quarter by ad vancing 1.7 percent in June; purchases of 
consumer electronics made particularly large gains, which some analysts attributed to 
television purchases ahead of the World Cup.  Euro-area consumer confidence held in 
June and July at the 3½-year high reached in May. 
 
Survey data show business sentiment still at hi gh levels in July but also show some signs 
of concern about future prospects.  The Eu ropean Commission’s survey showed a further 
increase in industrial confidence in July and a sharp rise in construction sector 
confidence.  In contrast, the euro-area purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing 
gave back some of recent gains in July, declining to 57.4 from 57.7 in June, where 50 is the threshold for positive growth.  The PMI for the service sector t ook a more substantial 
step back from 60.7 in June to 57.9 in July, the lowest level since Janu ary.  Data from the 
German IFO survey suggest that German firm s see current strength but are somewhat less

optimistic about the future than they were a few months ago.  The IFO business climate 
index soared in June to a 15- year high, but retraced that gain in July.  The current 
conditions component of the IFO edged just  a bit lower in July, but IFO business 
expectations dropped to their lowest level since last December.  
  
Euro-area consumer prices  rose 0.3 percent in July  from the previous month; the 
12-month rate of inflation remained at 2.5 percent.  Core inflation, excluding energy and 
unprocessed food, remained at 1.5 percent in June.  The European Central Bank (ECB) raised its policy interest rate ¼ percentage point to 3 per cent at its August 3 meeting.  
That move had been widely expected after the ECB had pledged “strong vigilance” against inflation in its statemen t following the July policy meeting. 
 
Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 3.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarte r, according 
to the preliminary estimate.  The business services and finance sector increased 5.1 percent (a.r.) and retail sa les rose 2.1 percent after declining 0.5 percent in the first 
quarter.  In contrast, indust rial production declined 0.4 percent.  The trade deficit 
narrowed, on average, in April and May re lative to the first-quarter average. 
 
Early indications suggest that on balance activit y in the third quarter will continue to be 
relatively strong.  Business confidence held  steady at a high level in July.  The 
manufacturing PMI in July indicates expansi on in that sector, though it fell to 53.8 from a 
downwardly revised 55 in June.  The PMI for the service sector and consumer confidence 
both moved down in July, although they both re main at a reasonably robust levels, and 
one of the leading surveys of retail sales s uggests that the rise in July’s sales will be 
around the average pace seen in the second quarter.  House prices, as collected by 
Nationwide, a leading British le nder, rose almost 6 percent in the twelve months ending 
in July, up from around 5 percen t last month.  While the unemployment rate has drifted 
upwards slightly since mid-2005, the participant rate has also  risen about ½ percentage 
point and the growth rate of em ployment has been relatively strong. 
 
On August 3, the Bank of England raised its official rate paid on commercial bank reserves by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent.  The twelve-month change in U.K. consumer 
prices rose to 2.5 percent in June, above the Bank of Engl and’s target of 2 percent, 
though consumer prices excluding energy prices  rose 1.3 percent over the same period.  
The Bank expects the headline inflation rate “t o remain above [its] 2 percent target for 
some while”, as some recovery in pay grow th and profit margins offset a moderation in 
energy price inflation.

Indicators of second-quarter economic activity in Canada suggest a sharp slowdown 
from the 3.8 percent rate of gr owth in the first quarter.  In May, real GDP by industry fell 
0.5 percent (a.r.), after only a modest 1.3 per cent advance in April.  Declines in goods 
production outweighed gains in services outpu t.  Except for a slight advance in the 
manufacturing sector, output of the major goods-producing sectors d eclined in May.  In 
the service sectors, w holesale trade continued to expand, but retail sales fell for the first 
time since last September. 
 
Other indicators for the second quarter also show a deceleration of GDP compared to the 
first quarter.  Housing starts in the second quarter were be low their lofty first-quarter 
level but were near their aver age over the past few years.  The merchandise trade balance 
improved in May after declining in each of  the previous four months.  However,  
exports continued to fall.  The average volume of manufacturing new orders and 
manufacturing shipments in April and May was each lower than th eir respective second-
quarter averages. 
 
Consistent with the retail sales data in the monthly GDP release, th e survey of retailers 
also showed a decline in May led by a drop in sales in the au tomotive sector.  The decline 
in retail sales was only the second in the last  eight months.  In contrast, the Canadian 
labor market has remained strong.  While employment was virtually unchanged in June, second-quarter job growth was the largest in nearly four year s, and the gains continued to 
be concentrated in full-time employment.  The unemployment rate held steady at 
6.1 percent, a 32-year-low.  
 
After spiking in May to 2.8 per cent due to higher gasoline pri ces at the pump, the twelve-
month rate of consumer price inflation pulle d back to 2.5 percent in June as gasoline 
prices receded a bit.  The tw elve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight 
most volatile components, fell to 1.7 percen t in June after touching 2 percent in May.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent economic indicators from the developing economies have been mixed but 
generally suggest some moderation in growth fr om its rapid first-quarter pace.  While the 
Chinese economy continued to expand strongl y in the second quarter, activity elsewhere 
in developing Asia showed some decelerati on.  In Latin America, second-quarter growth 
appears to have moderated somewhat in Me xico and Brazil but picked up a bit in 
Argentina and Venezuela.  Inflation in the developing world has edged up of late, but it 
has generally remained contained.  Emerging financial markets appear to have calmed 
recently, most notably in Turkey. 
 
The Chinese  economy continued to expand at a b listering pace in the second quarter, 
posting growth of nearly 12 percent at an annua l rate.  Despite official efforts to slow 
investment spending, investment in fixed asse ts accelerated in the second quarter, with 
four-quarter growth rising to 30 percent from  26½ percent in the first quarter.  Lending 
also accelerated in the second quarter.  Th e strong second-quarter GDP growth reflected 
another hefty rise in the trade surplus as we ll, as exports continued to expand at a rapid 
pace while imports rose only modestly. 
 
In June, industrial production showed a further strong gain, while twelve-month growth in retail sales remained near 14 percent.   The central bank responded to the recent 
strength of investment by raising reserve requirements for commercial banks ½ percentage point, the second such increase in the past two months.  The government 
also issued a new set of measures restrict ing foreign investments in mainland properties 
and announced it would more stringently enfor ce collection of capital gains taxes on real 
estate held for less than five years, thus attempting to cool the overheated real estate 
market.  Consumer price inflation is still low but has continued to edge up, reaching 1½ percent over the twelve months ending in June.

In Hong Kong, incoming indicators suggest GDP grow th slowed slightly from the heady

In Taiwan , incoming data suggest that growth pick ed up a bit in the second quarter after 
contracting slightly in the first.  A surge in  exports contributed to a sizeable trade surplus 
in the second quarter.  Although industrial  production fell in June, export orders for 
electronics increased considerably.  Twelve-m onth inflation edged up to 1.7 percent in 
June, as food and energy prices increased.

In Korea , economic conditions have moderate d since the last Greenbook.  Second-
quarter GDP growth slowed to 3.3 percent from  almost 5 percent in the first quarter.  
Contributing to the second-quarter weakeni ng were a moderation in consumption, a surge 
in import growth, and a drop in investment in  structures.  Korea pos ted a slight current 
account surplus (n.s.a.) in the second quarter  as export growth pi cked up after a first-
quarter dip and the service deficit narrowed.  Consumer prices rose 2.3 percent over the 
12 months ending in July.  The Bank of Korea le ft interest rates uncha nged in July, citing 
weakness in construction and a moderati on in real estate price inflation.

Performance of the Indian  economy remains robust.  On average, industrial production 
in April and May was up over 3¾ percent from  the first-quarter level.  Twelve-month 
consumer and wholesale price inflation con tinued to increase in June, although there are 
signs of moderation in the wholesale price inde x in July.  The trade deficit remained at 
nearly $44 billion in the sec ond quarter.  After surprising ma rkets with a rate hike in 
June, the Reserve Bank of India increased it s key rate another 25 basis points at its 
meeting in July, partly in response to higher oil prices.  Also to control inflation, the 
government has stopped the export of certa in food products such as lentils.

Incoming data for the ASEAN  economies suggest that econo mic activity moderated in 
the second quarter.  In Singapore, the advance unofficial estimate of  second-quarter real 
GDP growth (not shown) suggest s that growth dropped to ju st over 1 percent following a 
strong first-quarter performance, due mostly to a contraction in th e volatile biomedical 
sector.  Industrial production in Singapore appears to be rebounding, however.  
Elsewhere in the region, indus trial production has weakened in Indonesia and Malaysia in 
recent months.  Trade balances are down relative to the first quarter. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the region has moderated a bit of late, but remains elevated due to higher food prices in  some countries as well as higher energy 
prices.  Citing the moderation in inflation and the need to stimulate the domestic 
economy, Bank Indonesia lowered interest rate s 25 basis points in early July for the 
second time in two months.  In Thailand, the central bank left its benchmark rate 
unchanged at its recent meeting in mid-July after raising it thirteen times in fifteen 
consecutive meetings.

In Mexico , recent indicators suggest that econom ic growth remains healthy but has 
moderated from the strong first-quarter performance.  The index of overall economic 
activity (a monthly proxy for real GDP) rose 0.4 percent in May from  the previous month 
and was up 5.3 percent from its year-earlier level, mainly due to strong performance in 
the construction and services sectors.  Industrial production edged down in May from 
April, but was up 5.8 percent from a year earl ier mainly on the back of solid performance 
in manufacturing; average industrial produc tion for April and May was up 0.7 percent 
from the first quarter. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation was 3.2 percent in June, within the target range of 2 to 
4 percent.  On the political front, the July 2 presidential elections have so far been 
inconclusive.  Conservative Fe lipe Calderón obtained a narrow margin over leftist Andrés 
Manuel López Obrador.  However, López Ob rador has legally challenged the results 
before Mexico’s Electoral Tribunal, which in turn has until late August to rule on these 
challenges and until September 6 to formally declare a president-elect.  Despite this uncertainty, the peso has strengthened in recent weeks, after months of weakness.

In Brazil , incoming data have provided some ev idence of solid growth in the second 
quarter.  Industrial output jumped 1½ percent in May following a small increase in April, 
and May retail sales surprised on the upside.  However, June indicators on automobile 
and retail sales suggest some slowdown in activity.  The head line CPI declined 
0.2 percent in June, bringing twelve-month inflat ion to 4 percent.  June’s deflation owed 
in part to a sharp drop in the price of sugar cane, which is used to make fuel ethanol, a 
required gasoline supplement in Brazil.  Even  excluding that and othe r special influences, 
inflation has declined to its lo west level since the late 1990s. 
 
In mid-July, the central bank lowered its ta rget for the policy rate 50 basis points to 
14.75 percent, as was widely expected, brin ging the cumulative decline to 500 basis 
points since the current easi ng phase began last September.  Ahead of the October 
presidential election, Lula’s le ad over his main rival, cons ervative Geraldo Alckmin, has 
narrowed, making a runoff vote increasingly likely.

In Argentina , after moderate growth in the first quarter, incoming indicators point to 
faster growth in the second quarter.  The April-May average of the index of economic 
activity (a monthly proxy for GDP) is almost 8 percent (a.r.) a bove its first-quarter level.  
In the second quarter, industrial production a ccelerated after a weak  first quarter, owing 
largely to increased production of automobiles, cement and other construction materials.  
In June, twelve-month inflation edged down to 11.1 percent, in part due to the voluntary 
price agreements the government ha s secured in several sectors.

In Venezuela , recent indicators suggest that activity has continued to be strong, fueled by 
excessively expansionary monetary and fiscal  policies.  The high pr ice of petroleum has 
resulted in large current account  surpluses, and these inflow s have put upward pressure 
on monetary growth and infla tion.  Monthly inflation jumped to 1.8 percent in June, 
bringing the twelve-month increase to nearly 12 percent.  In response, some steps have 
been taken to restrict liquidity but at the same  time avoid raising short- term interest rates.  
In the latest of these measures, in late Ju ly, the central bank’s re serve requirement on new 
deposits was raised from 15 to 30 percent. 
 
On the political front, nine opposition candida tes have shown interest in competing in 
primary election in mid-August to determin e a single candidate who would run against 
President Chavez when he comes up for re-election in December.  However, Chavez is 
heavily favored to win the election.

In Turkey , real GDP rose 6.4 percent in the firs t quarter, driven by sharp increases in 
investment and private consumption.  More  recently, industrial production edged up in 
May.  Twelve-month consumer price inflati on was 10 percent in June, making the 2006 
annual target of 7 percent nearly unobtainable.   June producer prices increased by almost 
5 percent over May’s number, driven by increased fuel and metal costs.  The current 
account deficit continued to grow in May, reaching about 8 percent of GDP. 
 
In response to ongoing inflationary pressure and concerns about downward pressure on 
the foreign exchange value of the Turkish li ra, the Central Bank of Turkey has increased 
policy rates 4.25 percentage poi nts since early June.  The official borrowing and lending 
rates are now 17½ percent and 22½  percent, respectively.  Financial markets have partly 
recovered from their weakness in June, a nd Turkey remains on-track with its IMF 
program and EU accession negotiations.
