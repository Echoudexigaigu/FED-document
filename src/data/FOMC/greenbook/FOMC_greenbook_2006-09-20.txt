Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Economic activity so far this quarter appear s to have expanded at a relatively subdued 
pace.  Payroll employment continued to ri se moderately in July and August, and 
consumer and business spending held up well th rough July.  However, the contraction in 
home building is exerting considerable restra int on overall activity, and reductions in 
motor vehicle assemblies are cutting into growth  as well.  Energy prices posted another 
sharp increase in July, but they appear to have leveled out in A ugust and are on track for 
a sizable drop this fall.  Core  consumer price inflation ease d a bit in July but still has 
generally been running higher than it did in 2005. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
The demand for labor continued to expand in  August.  Private nonfarm payrolls rose 
111,000, an amount similar to the average incr ease over the previous four months and 
down from the pace of the first quarter.  Employment gains in the service-producing 
sector were widespread in August; an a dvance in the health-care component of 
nonbusiness services was especially notable.  The construction industr y also added jobs, 
with the increase concentrated in trades related to nonresiden tial building.  In contrast, 
retail trade employment decreased furthe r and is now down by about 100,000 workers 
over the past year.  Manufacturing employment also fell again in August, due partly to 
further losses in the motor vehicles and parts industries.  A small decline in the average workweek pulled down aggregate hours of pr oduction or nonsupervisory workers, which 
fell 0.2 percent in August to a le vel that was just 0.1 percent ( not at an annua l rate) above 
the second-quarter average.  
 
The unemployment rate edged back down to 4.7 percent in August, but remained in the 
narrow band that has prevailed since the beginning of the y ear; the labor force 
participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent.   The number of persons working part time 
for economic reasons—another indicator of labor market slack—has also been about 
unchanged in recent months.  And, while the proportion of individuals who quit work to 
search for a new job has edged down this year , it remains cyclically elevated, suggesting 
that workers have stayed fairly optimisti c about alternative employment prospects. 
 
Similarly, other indicators do not point to any significant change in labor market conditions in recent months.  The four-week  moving average of initial claims for 
unemployment insurance (UI) was 315,000 in the week ending September 2, up from its 
trough earlier in the y ear but still low.  Meanwhile, th e level of insured unemployment 
has risen only a little from the low levels of  the spring, and the exhaustion rate, which 
measures the fraction of UI recipients who did not find a job before th eir benefits ran out,

has moved sideways in recent months after some  sharp fluctuations earlier in the year.   
Moreover, private surveys of hi ring plans still suggest  that demand for labor is rising at a 
modest pace, although the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey suggests that the 
rate of job openings has edged down in recent months.  Readings on households’ 
expectations for the labor market continued to diverge in August: Although respondents 
to the Conference Board survey remained relatively upbeat, the measure from the 
Michigan survey deteriorated further. 
 
The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector increased at an annual 
rate of 1.4 percent in the sec ond quarter after rising 4.3 percent in the first quarter.  Over 
the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2006, pr oductivity rose an estimated 
2.5 percent, a step-up from the 1.6 percent p ace in the preceding four quarters.  As 
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ou tput per hour in the nonfinancial corporate 
sector increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the sec ond quarter and rose 4.8 percent 
over the past year.

Industrial Production  
Activity in the industrial sect or exhibited considerable vigor through July but likely 
declined a bit in August.  In July, total industrial produc tion (IP) was held down by a 
sharp drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, while production elsewhere posted 
another sizable gain.  In August, declin es in the hours of manufacturing production 
workers—which are a key input for the ini tial estimate of IP—and in energy output

essentially offset the boost to IP from a partial rebound in motor vehicle assemblies.1  
Looking ahead, the new orders diffusion index from the Institute for Supply Management 
and similar indexes from the various regiona l surveys suggest modest gains in coming 
months. 
 
In the high-technology sector, the IP index for co mputers continued to ri se at a tepid pace 
through mid-summer.2  Meanwhile, the output of communications equipment, which 
increased markedly during the first half of th e year, appears poised for some moderation.  
Capital spending by telecommuni cation service providers dropped back in the second 
quarter, and their guidance for the year as a whole suggests that spending is unlikely to 
increase during the remainder of this year.  However, CIO Magazine ’s diffusion index of 
plans for future spending on information tec hnology hardware as a whole was still quite 
positive in June (the latest available observati on), albeit a bit less so  than earlier in the 
year.   
 
Semiconductor production has been sluggish since the end of 2005, mainly because of weak demand for microprocessor units (MPUs).  This softness reflects both a loss of market share at Intel and a shift in demand toward lower-end MPUs.
3  Recently, 
however, Intel has rolled out its latest generation of MPUs , named Core 2 Duo.  These 
chips are significantly faster and more energy efficient relative to their predecessor, the 
Core Duo, and to the leading edge MPUs from AMD.4
                                                 
1 The decline in energy output reflects, in part, th e partial shutdown of British Petroleum’s crude oil 
extraction operations at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, as we ll as some refinery downtime needed to conduct 
maintenance that was postponed during the switchover to ethanol-blended gasoline earlier this year.  The 
repairs to the firm’s pipeline on the eastern side of Prudhoe Bay are unlikely to be completed until early next year.  However, the company has a proposal before  federal regulators to use alternative pipelines to 
bypass the damaged sections of pipe.  If the plan is approved, full production could resume by the end of October. 
2 The IP series for computers and peripherals is based primarily upon data on the value of total sales of 
personal computers and servers as reported by the Ga rtner Group.  These sales rose appreciably in the 
second quarter but seem to be giving back much of  this increase in the current quarter. The data are 
deflated by platform-specific price indexes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics producer price index 
program.  A trade adjustment is made using merchandise trade data from the Census Bureau and detailed 
product-level data from its annual Current Industrial Report . 
3 Intel’s main competitor, Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD), does not produce in the United States; 
therefore, swings in market share between Intel and AMD can have a significant effect on domestic 
semiconductor production. 
       4 Like its predecessor, the Core 2 Duo contains two processing units on a single chip.  However, the 
Core 2 Duo uses a new “architecture” th at speeds its data throughput and is reported to be 40 percent faster 
and more energy efficient than the previous generation of Intel MPUs and up to 28 percent faster than the 
leading-edge chips from AMD.

II-11 
Among market groups excluding energy, motor ve hicles and parts, and high-technology 
products, output gains have been sizable in recent months.  Equipment categories such as 
commercial aircraft, construction and mini ng equipment, and search, detection, and 
navigation equipment appear to be benefiti ng from robust demand at home and abroad.  
In addition, the production of defense and space equipment was 6½ percent above its 
year-ago level in July.   
 
Among construction supplies, the output of items that figure more prominently in 
nonresidential construction—suc h as architectural and stru ctural metals, construction 
steel, and electrical equipm ent—has remained relatively strong.  In contrast, the 
production of items that tend to be more important in residential construction, such as 
wood products, has decreased in recent months. 
 
Light Motor Vehicles  
Demand for light vehicles fell back in Augus t after having been boosted in July by a new 
round of incentives early that month.  Sale s over the two months averaged 16½ million 
units, a little higher than in the second quarter but below the average pace of 17 million 
units seen in 2004 and 2005.  More recently, the automakers reported robust sales over the Labor Day weekend; they also indicated th at sales have moved b ack into the range of 
16½ million to 17 million units.  
 
In part because of the higher gasoline prices  this year, the compos ition of vehicles sold 
has continued to shift away from full-size pic kups and sport-utility vehicles toward more 
fuel-efficient models, and the average fuel ec onomy of light vehicles sold has continued 
to move up.  The higher gasoline prices have also contributed to some slippage in the 
index of car-buying attitudes from the Michigan survey.  In addition, respondents to recent surveys have cited highe r interest rates and the pros pect of bad times ahead as 
reasons for their pessimism.   
 
The shift in consumer buying patterns has left  inventories of light trucks uncomfortably 
high.  Days’ supply of light trucks has crept up for several years and has been in a range 
of between 85 days and 90 days in recent months.  General Motors (GM) and Ford 
reportedly plan to address their inventory problems mainly thr ough production cuts; in 
the past, these firms often used other practi ces to reduce high inventories—for example, 
sales incentives and cut-rate sa les to daily rental companie s—that tended to boost market 
share at the expense of profita bility.  Indeed, light vehicle assemblies are likely to total 
just 10.7 million units at an annual rate in the third quarter—almost a million units below

the manufacturers’ initial schedules—and are slated to move down to 10.5 million units 
in the fourth quarter.  Only some of the recent and anticipated wea kness in motor vehicle 
production reflects the reductions to capacity  initiated by GM and Ford earlier in the 
year. 
 
Consumer Spending  
After slowing in early spring, consumer spe nding regained its footing and remained on a 
solid trajectory through midsummer.  In additi on to the aforementioned modest step-up in 
purchases of light motor vehicles from their lackluster pace in th e second quarter, real 
spending on non-auto goods posted steady increase s over the four months ending in July.  
Moreover, consumer spending on services pi cked up in July, in part because of a 
weather-induced increase in outlays on energy services. 
 
Real disposable income (DPI) now appears to have increased at a solid pace so far this 
year despite the sharp increase in energy prices.  On the basis of unemployment insurance tax records for the first quarter, the Bureau  of Economic Analysis (BEA) now estimates 
that real DPI rose at an annua l rate of 4½ percent in the firs t quarter, 3 percentage points 
above its earlier estimate; sec ond-quarter real DPI growth was revised up ½ percentage 
point to an annual rate of 1½ percent.
5  Reflecting the revisions to income, the level of 
the personal saving rate was ra ised ¾ percentage point over the first half of the year, 
although it remained in negative territory.  Mo re recently, the BEA’s estimates for July 
show a 0.3 percent rise (not at an annual rate) in real DPI and a 0.2 percentage point 
decline in the saving rate to negative 0.9 percent.     
 
Other key influences on consumption have been mixed.  On the one hand, consumer 
spending continues to draw significant support from the lagged effects of earlier increases 
in household wealth.  Indeed, although the ratio of household net worth to income 
decreased in the second quarter as a result of  a deceleration in house prices and a dip in 
stock values, it remained well above its histor ical average.  On the other hand, borrowing 
costs have risen this year as shor t-term interest rates have climbed. 
 
The high-frequency readings on consumer se ntiment from the Michigan survey have 
been erratic of late, perhaps owing to the sharp ups and dow ns in gasoline prices; the 
reading for August as a whole was slightly be low that recorded in July.  The Conference 
Board measure, which had held up reasonably well through July, also declined in August. 
                                                 
5 The revisions to wages and salaries that underlie the higher DPI figures are discussed in greater detail 
in the section on labor costs.

Housing  
Residential construction activity has continue d its downward trajecto ry in recent months.  
Single-family starts fell 2½ percent further in July, to an annual rate of 1.45 million units; 
the level of starts in July was 17 percent below the peak in the third quarter of 2005.  
Adjusted permit issuance in this sector has been falling steadily for a year, and July’s 
5¾ percent drop reduced the number of permits issued to the lowest level since early 
2002.  In addition, the backlog of unused perm its has fallen considerably after peaking 
late last year.  In contrast, construction in the multifamily sector has not displayed any signs of slowing.  Multifamily starts in July were at an annual rate of 343,000 units—well within the range that has prevailed since 1995—and the rate of perm itting in this sector 
has remained steady.  The pace of home sales has also weakened further in recent months.  Sales of existing single
-family homes fell 5 percent in July a nd stood 13 percent below their peak in mid-
2005.  Sales of new homes in July were 22 pe rcent lower than their record high, which 
was reached last summer.   
 
 
 
  
 Near-term indicators suggest that  housing m
 arket activity will slow further in the months 
ahead.  Inventories of unsold new homes have been increasing relative to sales for some time, and the months’ supply of new homes for sale is now more than 30 percent higher 
than the upper bound of the relatively narrow (and historically low) range it occupied 
from 1997 to 2005.  The index of pending home sales dropped 7 percent in July, a sign 
that sales of existing homes will continue to soften in the next few months.  In addition, despite their recent downturn, mortgage rates are up considerably since the beginning of 
the year.  The average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages rose 37 basis points from January to August, while the average rate for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages has 
climbed almost 50 basis poi nts, on net, this year. 
 House-price appreciation has slowed from the elevated rates
  seen last year.  The 
purchase-only version of the price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO ) increased at an a nnual rate of just 
5 percent in the second quarter; from the s econd quarter of 2005 to the second quarter of

2006, this index increased 8¼ percent, the smalle st four-quarter increase in almost three 
years.  The Case-Shiller home-price index, which covers sales in only ten large U.S. 
cities, has also decelerated sharply in recent months, and its level in June was about the 
same (on a seasonally adjusted basis) as in January.6  Moreover, home-price appreciation 
apparently has continued to slow in the thir d quarter; the average price of existing homes 
rose less than 1 percent over th e twelve months ending in Ju ly after increasing 9 percent 
in the preceding twelve-month period.  Howe ver, unlike the OFHEO and Case-Shiller 
indexes, the series for the average price of existing homes does not control for the 
characteristics of homes sold, and the abrupt  deceleration in this measure may reflect a 
shift in the composition of sale s away from higher-end homes.   
Prices for new homes have also decelerated.  The constant-quality price index for new 
homes—which is the most reliable measure of quality-adjusted pri ce appreciation in the 
new home market—was just 4½ percent higher in the second  quarter than in the same 
period last year, its smallest four-quarter change since th e spring of 2003.  Moreover, the 
NAHB survey reports that home builders have stepped up their use of incentives—such 
as paying closing costs, buying down mortgage  rates, and including optional items at no 
cost—to bolster sales.  If so, appreciation in the market  value of new housing may be 
even lower than implied by changes in the reported purchase price. 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software rose at  an annual rate of 6¾ percent in the first 
half of the year, and spending appears to ha ve remained robust into the summer.  The 
underlying fundamentals for business investment  continue to be quite favorable:  
Business output expanded briskly through the se cond quarter; corporate financial reserves 
are plentiful; and measures of executive sent iment, such as the capital spending diffusion 
index compiled by the National Association for Business Economics, are still elevated.  
In addition, falling relative pric es for high-tech equipment are continuing to drive down 
the cost of capital for these goods. 
 
In the high-tech sector, the data on orders  and shipments of co mmunications equipment 
have moved erratically in recent months.  On  the whole, however, they seem consistent 
with a leveling off in spending after a spectac ular increase in the first quarter and its 
partial reversal in the second quarter.  As has been the case in recent quarters, investment in this category is being supported by major spending on fiber-optic networks by 
telecommunications service providers as we ll as by spending for the replacement of

hurricane-damaged infrastructure.  Meanwhile, real computer spending appears poised to 
accelerate after a tepid performance in the first half of the year.  As noted earlier, the IP 
index for computers remained relatively sluggish in July.7  However, shipments of 
computers as measured by the M3 jumped, and the emergence of products that contain 
the new dual-core processor chips (discussed earlier) should help to buoy spending in coming months.   
 
In the transportation se ctor, business purchases of light ve hicles apparently picked up in 
August after a weak July, and sales of medium and heavy tr ucks remained brisk through 
midsummer.  Some of the strength in medium and heavy tr uck demand this year is the 
result of the Environmental Protection Agency ’s new regulations on truck engines, which 
take effect in 2007 and are likely inducing some businesses to accelerate their truck 
purchases into 2006.  In addition, net new or ders for medium and heavy trucks, which 
had fallen appreciably in the spring, bounced back in July.  Census data on aircraft 
shipments in July and information from Bo eing on its deliveries suggest that domestic 
aircraft outlays in the current quarter will re main around their weak second-quarter level. 
 
Real spending on equipment other than high-tech  and transportation rose at an annual rate 
of 6½ percent over the first half of the year.  The sharp increase in nominal shipments in 
July suggests that spending in the third quarter started out on a strong note.  Because orders for this broad category also increased in July and backlogs continued to grow, 
further increases in shipment s are apparently in store. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Outlays for the construction of nonresidential buildings continued to pick up in recent 
months, although activity remains well short of the pace seen before the last recession.  
Spending on office construction has sped up as  vacancy rates in this sector have 
continued to move down, and expenditu res on manufacturing structures have 
strengthened considerably of late.  The “other” category of construction has also 
registered strong growth, driven mainly  by increases in the lodging and health 
components.  The commercial category—whi ch includes retail, wholesale, and some 
service industries—has risen only a little, on balance, despit e retail vacancy rates that 
remain low by historical standards. 
 
                                                 
7 The extrapolator that the BEA uses to estimate business spending on computers now places a 
75 percent weight on industrial production and a 25 percent weight on M3 shipments.

Forward-looking indicators suggest that outlays for nonresidential c onstruction outside of 
drilling and mining will rise further over the next few quarters.  To be sure, the three-
month moving average of the architectural billings index—a diffusion index that measures whether billings by architectural fi rms are increasing or decreasing—has fallen 
considerably since its highs last fall and now shows that the number of firms reporting 
decreases is about equal to the number of firms reporting increases.
8  However, 
employment in the construction of nonresiden tial buildings has continued to expand in 
recent months, albeit less rapidly than it did ear lier this year.  Upbeat anecdotes from the 
Beige Book and industry analysts also point to a solid pace of c onstruction spending in 
the months ahead.   
 
Outlays on drilling and mining structures also rose appreciably over the first half of the year.  Increases in the numb er of rigs drilling for natu ral gas and petroleum through 
August imply that outlays on drilling and mining structures will continue to rise rapidly 
in the third quarter. 
 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory investme nt outside of the motor vehicle sector picked up to an 
annual rate of $53 billion in the second quarter, and book-value data for the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors poin t to only a modest slowing in the pace of 
accumulation in July.  Nevertheless, there are no signs of any significant overhangs 
outside of motor vehicles.  Data from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggest 
that—excluding motor vehicles and parts—mont hs’ supply moved lower, on balance, in 
June and July and that inventories are we ll aligned with demand.  Business surveys 
likewise indicate that firms continue to view the level of their cust omers’ inventories as 
being within a co mfortable range. 
 
                                                 
8 The architectural billings index includes billings fo r both nonresidential and residential construction 
projects, but an overwhelming majority of these projects (about 88 percent)  are nonresidential.  The level of 
this index is well correlated with nominal expenditure  growth in the nonresidential construction sector 
and—because the index has a lead time of about two quarters—suggests that spending will roughly level 
off by the end of the year.

A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, orwhen the first 3 days of a month are nonworking days.  Outlays for defense, Social Security,Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.  In addition,defense outlays for retiree health care have been converted from an annual to a monthly basis. In August2006, receipts and outlays were adjusted to reflect a one-time accounting correction by the Treasury thatreduced both individual income taxes and Social Security benefits by $6 billion.

Federal Government Sector  
The federal budget deficit improved a bit over the past two months.  According to the 
Monthly Treasury Statements, the combined deficit in July and August was $7 billion 
lower than in the same period last year.  The deficit over the twelve months ending in 
August, after routine adjustments for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, 
was $270 billion, and it was about $61 billion smaller than the adjusted deficit in the 
preceding twelve months.   
 
Federal outlays, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, increased 
7½ percent in July and August relative to thos e a year ago.  Net inte rest outlays increased 
31 percent from the level last July and August because of greater debt and higher interest 
rates, including larger inflation adjustment s on Treasury inflation-protected securities.  
Non-interest outlays were 5½ percent above  the year-ago level in  July and August, 
mainly because of higher spending for Medicare and Medicaid. 
 
Adjusted receipts in July and August we re 7½ percent above the year-ago level.  
Individual income and payroll tax receipts, which accounted fo r most of the receipts in 
July and August, were 5 percen t greater than those of a year  ago.  Corporate tax payments 
from the small number of firms that make pa yments in July and August were 38 percent 
above the year-ago level.     
 
Over the past two years, the deficit has declin ed as tax receipts ha ve grown faster than 
outlays; the increase in taxes has also out stripped nominal income growth.  On the 
individual tax side, the increase in liabilities relative to income (as measured in the NIPAs) may reflect real brack et creep, capital gains realizations (which are excluded 
from NIPA income), and a shift in the di stribution of income toward high-income 
households, which are in the top tax brackets and are more likely to be subject to the 
alternative minimum tax.
9  Corporate tax payments have been robust, in large part 
because of hefty gains in profits.  The incr ease in corporate tax liabilities beyond that 
which can be explained by profit growth ma y reflect a temporary and probably small 
boost from repatriated foreign earnings last y ear and possibly a shift in the dist ribution of 
corporate earnings from firms with untaxed  losses to firms with taxable earnings. 
                                                 
9 The BEA’s recent upward revision to wage and salary income in the first half of 2006 only explains a 
portion of the robust growth in individual receipts this year; much of the surge in individual income taxes 
came from final tax payments in April and May on last year’s tax liability.  In general, the correlation 
between quarterly variation in NIPA measures of income and of taxes tends to be quite weak because many 
factors can change effective tax rates on a quarterly basis.

In August, the Congressional Budget O ffice (CBO) released its update of The Budget and 
Economic Outlook , which presented a more favorable out look for the federal deficit than 
the CBO had anticipated in March.  This im provement was primarily due to greater-than-
expected individual and corporat e tax receipts this year and to the CBO’s assumption that 
a sizable portion of the upward revision will persist in coming years.  Taxable incomes, 
particularly corporate profits , were somewhat higher than the CBO had expected earlier, 
but receipts, especially from individual income  taxes, increased surprisingly faster than 
income.10  The CBO now projects the fiscal year  2006 deficit at $260 billion, or 2 percent 
of nominal GDP, down from 2½ percent of GDP  in fiscal 2005.  The CBO projects that 
the deficit will remain near 2 percent of GDP over the next several years if current 
policies are unchanged and real GDP incr eases about 3 percent per year.   
 
Before leaving for its August recess, the Congress passed a pension reform bill that tightens the funding requirements for employe r-sponsored defined-benefit plans and is 
intended to improve the financial situation of  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  
The legislation also included a number of other savings-related provisions, and it is 
estimated to increase the deficit by $6 billi on over the next five years.  Since returning 
from its recess, the Congre ss has continued work on the annual appropriations bills 
necessary to fund discretionary federal spending in the fiscal year th at begins October 1.  
So far, the House has passed eleven of the tw elve appropriations bill s, but the Senate has 
passed only two and none has been enacted.  A continuing resolution will be needed to 
fund agencies covered by appropriations bi lls that have not been enacted by the 
beginning of the new fiscal year.  
 
State and Local Government Sector 
Real state and local government spending appe ars to have moderated after having been 
pushed up by very large increases in construction expenditures in the first half of the year.   In July, we estimate that real constr uction spending fell to a level that was a bit 
more than ½ percentage point below its second- quarter level after the first-half surge that 
spanned all major categorie s except education.  Meanwhile, employment increased 
14,000, on average, in July and August, about the sa me pace as in the first half of the year 
and consistent with the m odest rate of hiring that has prevailed since 2004.   
 
                                                 
10 The CBO completed its projections before the release of the annual revisions to the national income 
and product accounts; however, based on a preliminar y assessment, the CBO indi cated that the revisions 
would not materially affect its budget outlook.

The incoming information on the fiscal positi on of the states continues to be very 
favorable.  The Rockefeller Inst itute reports that state tax co llections increased 10 percent 
on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter , a result of ongoing strength in individual 
and corporate income taxes.11  As has been the case at the federal level, increases in state 
income taxes have outpaced income gains over the past several quarters, perhaps 
reflecting factors like shifts in the distributi on of income and hefty capital gains (which 
are excluded from NIPA income).   
 
In addition, according to the preliminary State Budget and Tax Actions 2006 report from 
the National Conference of State Legislatures, year-end balances for fiscal year 2006, 
which ended in June for most states, equale d approximately 10 percent of general fund 
spending, a figure close to the highs of the late 1990s and 2000 and well above the 
5 percent generally considered to constitute  a sound fiscal position.  Nonetheless, many 
states face significant long-run st ructural imbalances in thei r budgets as a consequence of 
the underfunding of pension plan s and retiree health benefits  and the escalating cost of 
Medicaid. 
 
Prices 
Overall prices for personal consumption expe nditures rose 0.3 per cent in July; energy 
prices posted another sharp increase, but core prices in creased only 0.1 percent.  The 
relatively tame reading on core PCE inflation helped to bring the three-month change in 
that series down from its elevated levels of the preceding few months.  Nonetheless, the 
twelve-month change in core PCE prices rema ined at 2.4 percent in  July, 0.4 percentage 
point above the increase over the comparable period twelve months earlier.  Meanwhile, 
overall PCE prices rose 3.4 percent du ring the most recent twelve-month period, 
0.8 percentage point faster than  over the preceding year.   
 
The moderation in core inflation in July—and indeed the deceleration in the three-month 
change measure—was largely a result of a sh arp fall in the volatile apparel category.  
Elsewhere, core PCE prices have continue d to be boosted by signi ficant increases in 
shelter costs, which have risen close to ½ pe rcent in each of the past five months, while 
increases for a wide variety of other items have remained on the high side. 
 
The July surge in the PCE price index for energy boosted the twelve-month change to 
almost 22 percent.  However, gasoline prices have dropped back significantly from their  
                                                 
11 The Rockefeller Institute’s State Revenue Preview  contains information on tax collections in thirty-
four states that account for more than 75 percent of total state tax collections.

early-August peak.  Survey data  suggest that the PCE price index for gasoline was little 
changed in August, and a very sharp decline ap pears to be in train for this month.  Three 
factors have exerted downward pressure on ga soline prices.  First, concerns about 
supplies of crude oil from the Middle East have lessened, thereby pushing down prices 
for crude oil.  Second, suppliers built up invent ories of gasoline earlier in the year as a 
buffer against possible hurricane-related disrupt ions, and the mild start to this year’s 
hurricane season appears to have rendered these precautionary stocks less valuable.  
Third, the run-up in gasoline prices earlie r in the summer held down consumption in 
August.   
 
Natural gas prices have also fallen in r ecent weeks after spiking earlier this summer.  
Despite the bump in demand associated with July’s hot weather, inventories of natural 
gas remain near the top of their historical range for the season. 
 
The PCE price index for food rose 0.2 percen t in July and was up 2¼ percent in the 
twelve months ending in July.  Current USDA estimates point to ample supplies of crops 
and livestock this year, which have helped hold down price increases for food items.  One 
exception is wheat prices, which have moved up because of the poor harvest this year.   
However, the small share of wheat in the cost of finished food items should limit the 
consequent upward pressu re on consumer prices. 
 
Last month’s NIPA release contained no signifi cant revisions to the BEA’s figures for the 
GDP price index, which rose 3¼ percent over the year ending in the second quarter, 
½ percentage point faster than its year-a go pace.  Excluding food and energy, GDP prices 
accelerated about ¼ percentage  point over the same period. 
 
Survey-based measures of inflation expectati ons turned back up in August, most likely as 
a result of the run-up in gasolin e prices in the first half of  the month.  According to the 
Michigan Survey Research Center, the median of expected inflation over the next twelve months rose from 3¼ percent in June and July to 3¾ percent in August, with a larger rise 
in the first half of the month and a move b ack down in the second half.  The median of 
expected inflation over the next  five to ten years moved up to 3¼ percent.  In contrast, 
expected inflation over the next ten years as reported by the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters remained at the 2½ percent rate that  has prevailed for this series since the late 
1990s.  By comparison, as of September 12, in flation compensation implied by the rate 
spreads between the nominal and inflation- protected Treasury securities was down 
¼ percentage point from the le vel at the time of the last  Greenbook, to about 2.3 percent

Expected Inflation 
We have included a new exhibit showing three types of measures of  expected inflation. 
First, in the top pair of pane ls, we show the median responses to two familiar questions 
from the Michigan Survey Research Center, one about inflation twel ve months ahead and 
one about inflation five to ten years ahead.  The questions are asked of approximately 
500 households per month and do not refer to a ny particular price index.  (Specifically, 
the questions ask, “By about what percent [per year] do you expect prices to go up/down, 
on the average, during the next twelve  months [five to ten years]?”)   
 
Second, in the middle pair of panels, we show two series that are im portant inputs into 
our inflation models:  The FRB/US long-run ex pectations measure for CPI inflation and a 
distributed lag of core CPI inflation.  The FRB/US variable is constructed by splicing 
together three different series:  for 1991 fo rward, the median projection for CPI inflation 
over the next ten years from the Survey of  Professional Forecasters conducted by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia; for 1981 through 1991, a related survey conducted 
by Richard Hoey of Drexel Burnham La mbert; and for years preceding 1981, a model-
based estimate constructed by Board staff.  The distributed-lag measure is derived from 
one of the staff’s reduced-form Phillips curve models of core CPI inflation; multiplying 
the lagged inflation terms by the estimated coefficients on those terms (which are 
constrained to sum to 1) generates the meas ure shown.  This distributed lag, although not 
a direct measure of expected inflation, is highly correlated w ith actual inflation and likely 
includes an important expectations component. 
 
Finally, in the bottom pair of panels, we show two series for inflation compensation 
derived from a comparison of yields on nomi nal Treasury securities  to yields from 
Treasury inflation-protected secu rities (TIPS).  These series, one for the next five years 
and one for five to ten years ahead, provide  a market-derived measure of expected 
inflation, albeit one that also  includes premiums for liquid ity and for inflation risk.  
Beginning with March 2004, the series on inflat ion compensation over the next five years 
is adjusted for the indexation-lag effect.

At earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core intermediate 
materials rose 0.7 percent in July, bringing th e twelve-month change to about 8 percent, 
3¼ percentage points higher than in the pr eceding year.  Although pass-through of rising 
energy prices undoubtedly accounted for a large part of the increase, higher domestic 
rates of capacity utilization and robust global demand for th ese materials likely played 
important roles as well.   
 
The PPI for core crude materials climbed n early 35 percent during the year ending in 
July.  Since early August, the Journal of Commerce  (JOC) metals index has risen ¾ 
percent as recent upturns in s pot prices for several metals, most notably nickel, lead, and 
steel scrap, reversed the declines they had poste d in the first half of last month.  However, 
more broadly, both the JOC industrial i ndex, which includes a substantial energy 
component, and the Commodity Research Bur eau spot industrials index, which excludes 
energy items, have fallen ¾ percent since early August. 
 
Labor Costs 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has made some  substantial upward revisions to the data 
for compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, which is now estimated to 
have increased at an annual rate of 13¾ percent in the first quarter of 2006—the 
previously published estimate was about 7 percent—and 6½ percent in the second 
quarter.  As a result, hourly compensation is now reported to have risen 7¾ percent over 
the year ending in the second quarter, and the ri se in unit labor costs is 5 percent over the 
same interval.  Both of these figures mark a significant step-up from the pace of a year 
earlier. 
 
The upward revision to first-quarter compen sation reflects the benchmarking of private 
wages and salaries to the newly available first-quarte r tax records on unemployment 
insurance.  By industry, th e largest upward revisions were  in manufacturing (mostly in 
durables), construction, and professional and technical services; taken together, these 
industries accounted for about half  of the total revision.  We su spect that part of the jump 
in wages and salaries was caused by a surge in  stock option exercises.  Estimates show a 
noticeable step-up in stock option exercises in  the first quarter, espe cially in high-tech 
manufacturing and software services.  Such a rise would be consistent with the substantial upward revision to wages and sa laries in the manufacturing and professional 
services sectors.

12 The estimates come from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and are derived from data on the 
stock option exercises of company insiders at publicly traded firms.

was probably not related to stock options b ecause options are not used as commonly at 
such firms.)  In any event, an indication of the persistence of the first-quarter bulge will 
become available at the end of November, wh en the wage and salary data for the second 
quarter of 2006 are benchmarked. 
 The two other major gauges of labor costs— which exclude stock options—do not show a 
comparable acceleration.  Over the twelve months ending in August, average hourly 
earnings rose about 4 percent, a pickup of less than 1½ percenta ge points from the pace in 
the preceding year. The employment cost inde x rose about 3 percent in the four quarters 
ending in the second quarter, a bit be low the increase in the preceding year.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
The expected path of the federal funds rate  shifted down over the intermeeting period, as 
softer-than-expected infla tion data, lower oil prices, and FOMC communications 
reinforced expectations that the period of policy tightening may have come to an end.  
Nominal Treasury yields fell and inflati on compensation based on Treasury inflation-
protected securities (TIPS) decl ined notably at short and medi um horizons.  Equity prices 
rose moderately in response to the easing of inflation concerns and lower oil prices.  Risk 
spreads on corporate bonds were little changed at low levels, as inve stors continued to be 
sanguine about the near-term outlook for cor porate credit quality.  Household credit 
quality on the whole also has remained fa vorable.  Loan performance at commercial 
banks remained robust, and bank profits  were strong in the second quarter. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The FOMC’s decision at its August meeting to keep the target federal funds rate 
unchanged prompted a modest de cline in short-term rates, as only small odds had been 
placed on a 25 basis point increase in the targ et.  Inflation data over the intermeeting 
period generally came in a little below ma rket expectations, making investors more 
confident that the Committee w ill leave the target federal f unds rate unchanged at the 
September FOMC meeting.  This sentiment was reinforced by the re lease of the minutes 
from the August meeting, which indicated that the Committee saw economic growth as moderating and inflation pressures as likely to  diminish.  The expected path for policy 
beyond the upcoming meeting also shifted down.  Investors now expect no change in 
policy through the end of the year and about 50 basis points of policy easing by late 2007.  
Policy uncertainty, as inferred from implie d volatilities on options on Eurodollar futures 
contracts, was little change d over the intermeeting period an d remained near the low end 
of its historical range.  The implied distributi on of the federal funds rate about six months 
ahead is now skewed a little toward lower target rates. 
 Nominal Treasury yields declined about 10 to 15 basis points, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  In contrast  to their nominal counterpart s, TIPS yields (adjusted for 
the carry effect) rose about 20 and 10 basis points at the five- and ten-year maturities 
respectively.  Inflation compensation over th e next five years dropped notably, largely 
reflecting falling oil prices and weaker-than-expected July PPI  and CPI data.  At horizons 
further ahead, inflation compensation was little  changed.  Evidently, the decline in oil 
prices and the benign inflati on data increased investor c onfidence in the prospects for 
lower inflation and continued economic growth.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes rose  about 3 percent, on net,  over the intermeeting period, 
boosted by softer-than-expected inflation data  and lower oil prices.  Stock price gains 
were widespread outside the energy sector.  With stock pr ices rising, the twelve-month 
forward trend-earnings-price ra tio for S&P 500 firms edged down, but its spread over a 
long-run real Treasury yield, a measure of th e equity risk premium, remained about 
unchanged.  Implied volatility on the S&P 500 index fell and is not far above its 
historical low.    Over the intermeeting period, yields on both investment- and specula tive-grade corporate 
bonds generally fell in line with those on co mparable-maturity Treasury securities, and 
their spreads were about unchanged at relative ly low levels.  Risk spreads on commercial 
paper, measured by the difference between yi elds on thirty-day A2/P2 paper and A1/P1 
paper, also remained low.    
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Earnings news was sparse over the interm eeting period.  The second-quarter earnings 
reporting season, which came to a close in earl y August, showed that earnings per share 
for S&P 500 firms had increased 15 percent from a year earlier, a pace similar to that in 
the previous several quarters.  Through mid-August, revision s to an index of analysts’ 
forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were mildly positive on balance, 
reflecting continued strong exp ected profits in the energy se ctor.  Excluding energy firms, 
the year-ahead revisions index was about zero.  Since then, companies have provided 
little new guidance and analysts continue to forecast profit growth of about 10 percent 
through 2007.     Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to be solid.  Balance sheet 
liquidity declined a bit more in the se cond quarter, but remained high by longer-run 
standards, and corporate leverage was lo w.  Bond rating downgrades outpaced upgrades 
in July and August; however, excluding th e downgrades of bonds issued by Ford, net 
downgrades were modest.  In addition, the re alized six-month trailing bond default rate 
was near zero again in August, and the delinquency rate on C&I loans edged down 
further in the second quarter.  The near-t erm outlook for credit quality is also quite 
favorable.  The July forecast of the aggregat e year-ahead default rate based on the KMV 
model was only a bit above its lowe st level since the early 1990s.

Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms st epped up in August after having slowed 
sharply in July.  Meanwhile, commercial pape r outstandings decrea sed a bit, while C&I 
loans at commercial banks continued to expa nd at a torrid pace.  On balance, net debt 
financing has declined moderately from its elev ated pace in the first half of the year but 
remains robust, supported in part by needs to finance strong merger and acquisition 
activities.  Both seasoned equity offerings and IPOs continued to be very weak in August.  Nevertheless, a backlog of IPO filings and th e recent decline in equity price volatility 
point to a near-term pickup in issuance.  Indicators suggest th at private equity 
investments by buyout firms continued to  be robust in recent months.  
  Even so, gross equity issuance continued to be  dwarfed by equity retirements, which have 
been boosted by strong profits and ample cash on  corporate balance sh eets.  In July and 
August, the pace of retirements from cash-fi nanced mergers and acquisitions, helped by a 
high level of leveraged buyout deal s, matched the robust pace in the first half of the year.  
Meanwhile, announcements signaled relatively strong share repurchases.  Overall, net 
equity issuance appears to have remained deeply negative.   
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage borrowing is estimated  to have remained strong in the second 
quarter, leaving the amount of debt outstand ing 15 percent above its year-ago level.  
However, borrowing is likely to moderate in the third quarter, given the rise in mortgage 
rates and the lower issuance of commercial-mor tgage-backed securities (CMBS) to date.  
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yiel ds on investment-grade CMBS over those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities held  steady at low levels.  Delinquency rates on 
commercial mortgages remained low by histor ical standards through the second quarter, 
and a further decline in vacancy rates and additional firming in rents through early September indicate continued improve ment in market fundamentals.  
 
Household Finance 
Interest rates on new home mortgages d ecreased over the intermeeting period but 
remained close to their highest  levels over the past few year s.  Four-quarter growth of 
home mortgage debt is estimated to have slowed in the second quarter but remained 
above 12 percent.  Growth of consumer cred it over the year ending in July remained 
modest.

Overall, household debt expande d more rapidly than disposable income, and the financial 
obligations ratio reached anothe r new high in the second quarter.1  Nonetheless, the 
evidence to date suggests that households ge nerally are not having trouble meeting their 
obligations.  While delinquency rates have gene rally remained low, the latest data show 
small increases for consumer loans at comm ercial banks in the second quarter and for 
subprime mortgages in July.  The pace of pe rsonal bankruptcy filings continued to be 
subdued over the inte rmeeting period. 
 In the second quarter, house prices posted th eir smallest quarterly increase in several 
years, and stock prices dec lined; as a result, the ratio  of household net worth to 
disposable personal income ticked down.  On net, mutual fund inve stors continued to 
withdraw money from domestic equity funds in  August, while intern ational equity funds 
and bond funds continued to register net inflows.  
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, th e Treasury auctioned two-, th ree-, five-, and ten-year 
coupon securities and reopened the thirty-year Treasury bond.  Demand at these auctions 
was generally somewhat weak, with bid-to-c over ratios and indirect bidding ratios 
slightly below their historical averages .  Recent indicators of foreign demand for 
Treasury securities were mixe d.  Treasury data released in  August suggest that foreign 
participation at Treasury auctions remained tepid during July, but Treasury securities held 
in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York edged a bit higher over the 
intermeeting period.  On August 24, Fannie Mae announced that the Ju stice Department had ended a two-year 
investigation into the company’s accounti ng irregularities, and Freddie Mac made a 
similar announcement this month.  Over th e intermeeting period, both Fannie Mae’s and 
Freddie Mac’s stock prices were up about 10 pe rcent, and agency debt spreads fell some, 
on net.  
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds remained robust in July and August.  New 
capital issuance, led by the education sect or, continued to be strong, and advance 
refundings rose a bit in August wh en interest rates fell.  Issu ance of short-term municipal  
                                                
 
1 Consumer credit and home mortgage debt outstanding were revised up, primarily since 2000, based 
in part on data from the recent quinquennial survey of finance comp anies.  These revisions suggest a 
steeper upward trajectory for the financia l obligations ratio in recent years.

bonds rose in July and August but was below la st year’s pace, consistent with improved 
state and local budgets.   The credit quality of municipal bonds continue d to be solid.  During July and August, the 
number of bonds with rating upgrades again far outpaced the number with downgrades.  
Also consistent with strong m unicipal credit qualit y, the ratio of municipal bond yields to 
Treasuries remained low.  
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 grew at a 4 percent annua l rate in August, similar to the aver age pace over the 
preceding several months, with growth restra ined mainly by the lagged effects of higher 
interest rates on the opportuni ty cost of holding liquid a ssets.  Currency holdings 
increased at a tepid pace, in part restrain ed by weak foreign demand.  Other components 
of M2, such as small time deposits and reta il money funds, whose yields tend to track 
market rates, continued to grow rapidly.  Commercial bank credit decelerated in August, as  residential real estate loans and banks’ 
holdings of securities contracted.  Lending to businesses continued to be robust, as 
commercial real estate loans increased at nearly a 10 per cent annual rate and C&I loans 
accelerated to an annual rate of almost 30 perc ent.  The surge in C&I loans reflected in 
part a large investment-grade syndicated loan used to finan ce a merger; but, even without 
this deal, C&I loans grew at an annual rate of almost 20 percent in August.   
 Loan price data from the Survey of Te rms of Business Lending conducted in August 
indicate that the average spr ead of C&I loan rates over banks ’ cost of funds—adjusted for 
changes in nonprice loan char acteristics—remained low.  Spreads on syndicated loan 
tranches at commercial banks through August were also low. 
 Call Report data indicate that the profitability  of the commercial banking sector stayed 
strong in the second quarter.  Although net in terest margins remained under pressure, 
profitability was boosted by a si zable reduction in noninterest expenses, consistent with 
further gains in operating effici ency.  Provisioning for loan losses also remained low, 
reflecting continued expected high qual ity on consumer and business loans.

In July, the value of exports of goods and se rvices fell 1.1 percent af ter rising more than 
2 percent in each of the prev ious two months.  Exports of aircraft, computers, other 
capital goods, and industrial suppl ies all registered significant d eclines in July.  Each of 
those categories had risen signi ficantly in June, with the excep tion of aircraft.  Exports of 
telecommunications equipment reversed its June decline, while exports of 
semiconductors fell for the second consecutive  month in July.  Exports of automotive 
products were strong for the second straight month.  Services exports were flat, after 
falling slightly in June. 
 
The value of exports in the second quarter increased 14 percent (a.r.).  Exports of 
industrial supplies and capital goods (excluding aircraft) posted the largest gains.  In 
contrast, exports of automotive products and airc raft fell.  On a NIPA basis, real exports 
are now estimated to have increased 6.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 
5.1 percent in the BEA’s preliminary release.

IV-4 
The value of imported goods and services incr eased 1 percent in Ju ly, after rising at 
roughly the same rate in June.  The increase in imports reflected a sharp rise in the value 
of imported oil, reflecting higher prices, as we ll as noticeable increases in imports of non-
oil industrial supplies and capit al goods.  The increase in ca pital goods came after several 
months of little growth.  Auto imports declined sharply in July, reversing almost all of their large June gain.  Imports of services fe ll slightly in July after increasing a similar 
amount in June. 
 
The value of imports in the second quarter rose  11 percent (a.r.), reflecting a jump in oil 
imports, as well as increases in imports of  capital goods and services.  Imports of 
consumer goods also rose noticeably, whereas imports of automotive products and non-oil industrial supplies were l ittle changed.  On a NIPA ba sis, real imports are now 
estimated to have increased 1.5 percent in th e second quarter, compared to 0.6 percent in 
the BEA’s preliminary release. 
 
With the July trade data release, services exports and imports were revised for the January to June period.  The revisions to th e data for the second quarter were sizable, 
with the revisions to import s being somewhat larger than  the revisions to exports.  
Compared with the previously published data , the value of services exports was revised 
up $1.5 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter, and the value of services imports 
was revised up $5 billion.                                                                                                                                
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In July, import prices of bot h non-oil goods and core goods fell 
0.1 percent.  After increasing 3.2 percent in May and another 2.4 per cent in June, prices 
for non-fuel industrial supplies fell 0.8 percen t in July, primarily re flecting lower prices 
for unfinished metals and building materials.  A 0.1 percent decline in prices for imported 
consumer goods also contributed to the de cline.  Other categories of core goods 
experienced price increases.  F ood prices rose 0.1 percent.  Prices for imported capital 
goods (excluding computers and semiconductors ) and automotive products were also 
higher, each increasing 0.2 pe rcent.  Prices for imported computers fell 0.6 percent, 
whereas prices for semiconductors rose 0.9 percent. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 4.7 percent in July.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (WT I) crude oil averaged around $7 4.50 per barrel in July and 
$73 per barrel in August.  In early August, the spot price of WTI surged to $77 per barrel following the disruption of supp lies from Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.  Since then, oil prices

 Exports.   In July, prices of U.S. exports of  total goods and core goods both increased 
0.4 percent.  Prices for nonagr icultural industr ial supplies increased 0.6 percent in July, as 
higher prices for chem

Agricultural export prices rose 1.9 percent.  Within finished goods, the most notable price increase was a 0.4 percent rise for consumer  goods.  Prices for automotive products and 
capital goods (excluding computers and se miconductors) increased 0.3 and 0.2 percent, 
respectively.  In contrast, prices of ex ported computers and semiconductors each fell 
1.2 percent.

in July is substantially higher than their pa ce in 2005 ($0.6 billion per month).   Official 
inflows from other oil exporters including No rway and Russia have been volatile this 
year, most likely reflecting active portfolio ma nagement of their increased oil revenues.  
G-10 countries and the ECB (line 1a) in July registered a small increase ($1 billion) in 
their holdings in the United States, the first instance of an increase in 2006.  Net foreign 
official outflows to these countries totale d a bit above $26 billion for the first seven 
months of 2006.

Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securiti es (line 4), which have been quite strong in 
the la
st two quarters, decelerated considerably in July; the weakness in July was 
widespread across debt securities.  For Treasury securities (line 4a),  July shows net sales 
of a bit less than $7 billion; for the first seven months of 2006, private foreigners have 
increased their holdings of Tr easury securities by less than $1 billion.  Private foreign 
purchases of agency bonds in July decelerat ed to a virtual standstill (line 4b); this 
weakness came after very strong year-to-date  purchases of a bit under $68 billion, about 
the same as for the whole of 2005.  Foreign pur chases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 4c) 
decelerated considerably in July to about $9 billion, coinciding with relatively low bond 
issuance.  Conversely, net purchases of corporat e stocks (line 4d) for July totaled almost 
$9 billion, in contrast to net sales in June; ye ar-to-date, equity infl ows are running a little 
above their pace in 2005.   U.S. private acquisitions of foreign securities (line
  5) accelerated in July, reaching a bit 
over $23 billion, well above the pace of 2005.  Flows into foreign bonds (line 5a) 
accentuated in July, reaching a bit over $19 billion, the second-largest U.S. private 
purchase of foreign bonds on record.  However,  purchases of stocks (line 5b) in July 
amounted to only $4 billion, following essentially no purchases in June.  This recent weakness is associated with large net sale s of Japanese equities by U.S. investors. 
 Inflows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) reached a bit over $21 billion in July, a 
sharp rev
ersal of outflows in June of $65 billion.  This volatility is not unusual, however, 
as the magnitude and direction of banking fl ows often vary significantly from month to 
month.

Foreign Financial Markets 
 
Over the intermeeting period, the major currenc ies index of the dollar’s exchange value 
rose 1¼ percent on net.  The dollar appreciated 1¼ percent on balance against the euro, 
1¾ percent versus sterling, and 2¼ percent against the yen, but was little changed against 
the Canadian dollar.  On a trade-weighted ba sis, the dollar was little changed against the 
currencies of our other im portant trading partners. 
 
Market participants revised down their expecta tions of policy interest  rates for the next 
12 to 24 months in the United States, Japan, and Canada over the period.  The downward 
revision was particularly evident in Japan; lower-than-expected data releases on Japanese consumer prices, GDP, machinery orders, and industrial production drove this shift in 
market expectations.  Sharp dr ops in energy prices also app eared to influence inflation 
expectations and hence expecta tions for monetary policy in a number of these countries.  
In contrast, the expected path of short-term in terest rates in the euro area rose, as several 
European Central Bank officials highlight ed the Bank’s “strong vigilance” over 
inflationary pressures.  Most market analys ts now predict that the ECB will increase its 
policy interest rates again in early October.   There were no monetary policy actions by 
the ECB, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, or the Bank of Canada during the 
intermeeting period.   
 
Ten-year nominal sovereign yields declined 10 to 25 basis points in major industrial countries over the period; the United Kingdo m and the euro area countries recorded the 
smallest declines, while Canada recorded  the largest drop.  Long-term inflation 
breakeven rates, measured as the differe nce between nominal and inflation-indexed 
ten-year sovereign yields, declined across indu strial countries, with the exception of the 
United Kingdom, where they  were little changed.   
 
Stock prices reacted positively to  the declines in crude oil pr ices and in expected future 
policy interest rates: major headline equity indexes rose over the period in Europe, Asia, 
and the United States, but not in Canada, a net oil exporter.  Trading conditions were 
quite orderly over the period, and measures of stock market and foreign exchange market 
volatility remained low.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude fell 17 percent on net from its near-record high of early August, and the pric e of gold fell 9 percent, to 
less than $600 per ounce.  La te in the period, the prices  of many other metals, both 
precious and industrial also experienced larg e drops.  On balance, however, owing to 
IV-11 
increases in late August and September, th e prices of many industrial metals changed 
only slightly over the intermeeting period.   
 Financial assets in emerging markets genera lly did not register sharp price m
 ovements 
over the period.  The dollar appreciated 1 pe rcent versus the Mexican peso on net but 
depreciated about ½ percen t against the Brazilian real, and exchange rate movements 
against the currencies of emerging Asia were also modest.  Headline equity indexes rose 
in most Asian countries and in Mexico, where protests over the outcome of the 
presidential election appeared to have little impact on financial markets.  Equity prices 
declined in Brazil and Thailand, however.  Dollar-denominated sovereign bond spreads 
generally remained at levels that are near all-time lows.  The dollar depreciated 0.3 percent on net against the Chinese renminbi over the period, and the daily variability of the heavily-m
anaged dollar-renminbi exchan ge rate rose slightly; some analysts 
interpreted these developments as possible preludes to further renminbi appreciation 
against the dollar.  The People’s Bank of China increased its benchmark bank lending 
rate 27 basis points on August 18, a move the Ba nk stated was designed to slow the rapid 
expansion in credit and investment.  Kor ea’s central bank also raised it main policy 
interest rate, on August 10, by 25 basis points.    
  The Desk did not intervene during 
the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Second-quarter GDP decelerated in the advan ced foreign economies, to 2½ percent from 
3¼ percent in the first quarter.  Negative contributions from net exports were among the 
primary reasons for slower growth in Japa n and Canada, while strong domestic demand 
spurred growth to pick up in the United Kingdom and especially in the euro area. 
 
Incoming data suggest that overall third-quarter  GDP growth will step down slightly from 
the second quarter rate.  However, this masks different near-term paths at the country level.  The latest indicators for household spending and consumer confidence have fallen 
in the United Kingdom and those for business inve stment have fallen in the euro area.  In 
Japan and Canada, data have also been relatively weak, but still suggest some rebound from the very slow second-quarter expansion. 
 
Consumer price inflation conti nues to edge down from its recent highs.  In the euro area, 
the United Kingdom, and Canada, the latest h eadline inflation readings have all receded 
to 2½ percent or lower, after touching or topping that rate in the second quarter.  Core inflation in these countries remains below 2 percent.  In Japan, a rebasing of the CPI weights in August led to downward revisions to recent inflation readings; although still 
slightly positive, the revised inflation figures  show less price growth  than the previous 
index had shown.

  2. Percentage point contribution to GDP growth. 
 
Although GDP growth in Japan  slowed to 1.0 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, private 
consumption and nonresidential investment rose at annual rates of 2.0 percent and 
15.4 percent, respectively.  In contrast, re sidential investment fell 10.4 percent and 
government spending fell 0.9 percent.  The external sector also made a negative 
contribution to growth.  The GDP  deflator continued to decline, falling 0.7 percent from a 
year ago, but the deflator for total domes tic demand increased 0.1 percent, marking its 
first increase since 1998.   
 
Private domestic demand got off to a shaky start in the third qua rter.  Real household 
spending and retail sales both fell 1.7 percent in July, while industrial production fell 
0.9 percent.  Machinery orders, a volatile but leading indicat or of investment, plunged in 
July.  Government spending appe ars likely to continue to decline or grow slowly, as 
public works orders rose only 0.4 percent in July.  In contra st, net exports showed signs 
of a rebound as the real merchandise trade ba lance expanded further and the labor market 
continued its steady improvement.  The unemp loyment rate fell one tenth to 4.1 percent 
in July, and the job offers-to-applicants ra tio (the number of officially posted job 
openings relative to the number of  officially registered job seek ers) rose further to 1.09.   
Despite the rise in job offers, nominal wage s fell in July and were down 0.1 percent from 
a year earlier.

The weights used in forming the consumer price index were updated in August, leading 
to a greater than expected downward revi sion to inflation:  twelve-month headline 
inflation for July was revised down from 0.8 percent using the old weights to only 
0.3 percent.  Using the new wei ghts, core consumer prices for the country as a whole, 
which exclude only fresh foods, were only 0.2 per cent higher in July than a year earlier, 
while consumer prices excluding both fres h food and energy were 0.3 percent lower.  
Interest rates fell after the rebasing as market participants scaled back  expectations of the 
pace at which the Bank of Japan will raise its policy rate; however, Bank of Japan 
officials claimed that the revisions would have little impact on their decisions.  
 
Real GDP in the euro area  rose 3.6 percent (a.r.) in th e second quarter, and the first-
quarter rate of growth was revised up from 2.5 percent to 3.2 percent.  The pace of the 
economic expansion in the first half was the fastest since the first half of 2000.  The components data showed that the economi c recovery broadened to domestic demand. 
Although private consumption remained re latively sluggish, investment surged 
8.8 percent.  Overall, final domestic demand co ntributed 2.7 percentage points to growth 
in the second quarter, and inventory accumulation added another 0.6 percentage point.  Both imports and exports decelerated substa ntially in the second quarter, making a small 
positive contribution to growth on net.  At  the country level, French GDP grew 
4.7 percent despite a si zeable negative contribution from net exports, and a rebound in 
construction activity led German GD P to accelerate to 3.6 percent. 
 
The most recent business surveys suggest that euro-area GDP growth may have peaked in the second quarter and point to a gradual slow down in the second half of the year.  The 
European Commission (EC) indicator of euro -area industrial confid ence and the German 
IFO both fell in August.  The declines in both indices are attributable to a marked 
deterioration of the expectations component  for production in the months ahead, while 
the assessment of current conditions remain ed nearly unchanged.  Incoming data for 
Germany nonetheless suggest that  the industrial sector  continues to be an important force 
for economic growth heading into the thir d quarter.  In July, German industrial 
production grew a brisk 1.2 percent, led by a 3.4 percent jump in construction activity, 
and German manufacturing orders rose 1.8 per cent, pushed up by a surge in large foreign 
bookings.  In contrast, in France, industrial output excluding cons truction unexpectedly 
fell 1.3 percent in July, with production slipping across all sect ors and sharp falls in auto 
and intermediate goods.

In August, the EC measure of euro-area consum er confidence remained near its five-year 
peak, consistent with a pick-up in househol d spending in the current quarter.  In July, 
retail sales in the euro area rose 0.6 percent from the previous month, despite a 
1.2 percent drop recorded in Germany. 
 
In July, the unemployment rate in the euro area remained unchanged at 7.8 percent after 
declining slightly in each of  the previous two months.  Labor market conditions have 
gradually improved over the past year, partly  because of improving private-sector job 
creation and partly because of jobs cr eated by government-sponsored programs. 
 
According to the preliminary estimate, the twelve-month change in euro-area consumer 
prices declined to 2.3 percent in August from 2.5 percent the previous month.  Core 
inflation edged up to 1.6 percent in July.  Th e ECB left its policy rate unchanged at its 
August 31 meeting, but it signaled that a 25-basi s-point hike is very  likely at its next 
meeting in October.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 3.1 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, revised 
down slightly from the preliminary estimate released last month.  Consumption growth, 
which had been relatively subdued over most of the past year as households increased 
their saving rate, rose to 4 pe rcent and helped bring the incr ease in final domestic demand 
up to 3.9 percent in the second quarter.  Net exports and a slower accumulation of 
inventories both made negative contributions to GDP growth. 
 
Data in the third quarter, especially for households, are somewhat softer than in the 
second quarter but on balance st ill suggest that activity will continue to be relatively 
strong.  Retail sales contracted  0.2 percent in July after ri sing 2 percent in the second 
quarter.  However, surveys suggest that sa les continued at a reasonably strong pace in 
both July and August.  Households are increasingly concerned about the general 
economic situation, leading consumer confidence  to edge down further in August to its 
lowest point in three years.  The service sector PMI inched down to 56.7 in August, still indicating expansion but conti nuing a downward slide that star ted in May.  House prices, 
as collected by Nationwide, a leading British lender, rose more than 6.5 percent in the 
twelve months ending in August and have been trending up since the beginning of the 
year.

Industrial production rose 0.1 pe rcent in July, after bei ng unchanged in the second 
quarter.  The manufacturing PMI ticked down further in Augus t, though it still indicates 
expansion in that sector.  Business confidence held steady on average in July and August 
at its relatively-high second-quarter level.  Second-quarter surv eys of business investment 
plans in both the manufacturing and services sectors are quite strong.  The trade balance 
improved slightly in July. 
 
The Labor Force Survey and claimant count measures of the unemployment rate held 
steady in their latest readings, at 5.5 per cent in June and at 3 percent in August, 
respectively.  While the Labor Force Survey  measure of the unemployment rate has 
drifted upwards since mid-2005, the growth rate  of employment has been relatively solid 
and the participation rate al so has risen noticeably.  This increase in the labor force 
reflects in part older workers who have mainta ined their attachment to the labor market 
and possibly increased inward migration from th e rest of the European Union as well.  In 
August, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation rose to 2.5 percent, up slightly 
from its rate in July, and well above the 1.9 percent posted in January.  The rate of 
inflation excluding energy was 1.5 per cent, up from 1.2 percent in July.

In Canada , real GDP grew 2 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, slowing sharply from 
the 3.6  percent rate of expansion in the first quarter.  Consumer spending and business 
investment both advanced, although at somewhat  slower rates than in  the first quarter.  
Nonresidential investment growth  was in line with its averag e over the past three years:  
investment in machinery and equipment c ontinued to boom, which led to strong import 
growth (since most business machinery and equipment is imported).  With exports 
declining for a second consecutive quarter, ne t exports were a drag on growth.  Inventory 
accumulation more than reversed its declin e of the first quarter and contributed  
1.8 percentage points to growth.

Early indicators suggest growth  will remain somewhat subdued in the third quarter.  The 
average level of housing starts  in July and August was a bit below the second-quarter 
average.  The merchandise trade balance edged do wn for a second consecutive month in 
July as imports increased at a slightly fast er pace than exports.  In August, the Ivey 
Purchasing Managers Index declined  for a fifth consecutive month. 
 
Despite a small decline in total employment in July and August, growth in full-time employment remained strong but was more than offset by declines in part-time employment.  The year-long strength in full- time job gains suggests continued solid job-
market prospects.  The unemployment rate  edged up to 6.5 percent in August, up a bit 
IV-28 
from the 32-year-low of 6.1 percent touched in  June, due to new entrants in the labor 
force. 
 
After spiking in May to 2.8 per cent due to higher gasoline pri ces at the pump, the twelve-
month rate of consumer price inflation ha s since receded, moving down to 2.3 percent in 
July.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile 
components, has similarly declined, to 1.5 percent in July after reac hing a two-year high 
of 1.9 percent in May.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Across the emerging market economies, incoming  data generally point to robust, though 
moderating, growth.  In Emerging Asia, ther e are hints that government policies are 
beginning to temper growth in China.  In Latin America, Mexico  posted another strong 
output figure in the second quarter, although Brazilian performance surprised on the 
downside.  Inflation is generally well-conta ined, but high fuel costs continue to put 
upward pressure on prices.  
 
In China , after real GDP expanded at a blistering 12 percent (a.r.) pace in the second 
quarter, the latest data pres ent tentative signs of slowi ng.  Average industrial production 
for July and August was 2¼ percent above that of the previous quarter and twelve-month 
growth of fixed investment moderated to 21 percent in August.  These monthly data are 
noisy, however, and retail sales growth has re mained elevated.  Consumer prices rose 
1.3 percent over the 12 months ended August, and growth in the money supply and bank 
loans held above target levels.  Exports a nd imports both accelerated in August, resulting 
in a further increase in the trade surplus.   
 
In mid-August, the People’s Bank of China raised the benchmark one-year bank lending rate and the one-year bank deposit rate 27 basis points each.  For the le nding rate, this is 
the second rise in four months.  Although increases were small and much of bank lending is still not market based, some analysts are interpreting the move as signaling that 
Chinese authorities will more rigorously enforc e administrative controls already in place 
and possibly introduce further measures.

In Hong Kong, GDP was unchanged in the second quarter, after booming in the first 
quarter.  About half of this slowdown came from  a contraction in net exports.  Indeed, the 
second-quarter trade deficit was the larges t since 1997, with both exports and imports 
falling.  In July, tourist arrivals grew at a robust pace and retail sales continued to expand 
briskly.  Twelve-month inflation was 2.3 percen t in July, largely re flecting rising energy 
prices and housing rents.

In Taiwan , after contracting in the first quarter, GDP jumped  4.6 percent in the second 
quarter, largely on the back of  an improving external sector , as evidenced by the sizable 
trade surplus in that quarter.  Althou gh industrial production has fallen for two 
consecutive months, export orders for electron ics continued growing steadily in July.  
Twelve-month inflation turned negative  in August, as food prices declined.

Korean  economic indicators suggest continued moderate growth.  Industrial production 
sank almost 4 percent in July, weighed down by strikes in the auto sector and unusually 
heavy rainfall.  However, sentiment data s howed signs of stabilizing in July and August 
after declining since la te last year.  The current account  balance turned negative in July, 
reflecting weak exports of both goods and se rvices, but indicators for August suggest 
some improvement in the goods trade balance.   Consumer prices jumped 2.9 percent over 
the 12 months ended August, as poor weather cont ributed to a spike in food prices.  Core 
CPI rose 2.2 percent over the same period.  Last month, the Bank of Korea surprised 
markets by boosting interest rates 25 basi s points to 4.50 percent.  The Bank also 
announced that its inflation target for 2007 through 2009 would be unchanged at 2.5 to 
3.5 percent, but the Bank switched the targeted rate from core to headline CPI inflation.

Economic activity continued to expand in India.  Industrial production jumped over 
5 percent in the second quarter, before retrac ing some of the gains in July, and the trade 
deficit widened further in July, reflecting su rging non-oil imports a nd weaker exports.  
Inflation of the closely watched wholesale price index remained near  5 percent over the 
12 months ended August.  The central government ’s deficit for the first four months of 
the fiscal year reached almost 60 percent of its annual target, raisi ng questions about the 
ability of the government to comply with the goals of its Fiscal Responsibility and

Second-quarter performance varied across the ASEAN region.  Real GDP growth fell in 
Malaysia and Singapore from the torrid first- quarter rates, but rose  in Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand.  Across the region, lower trade balances weighed on second-
quarter activity, but a rebound in the agricultu ral and mining sectors in the Philippines, 
and a recovery in consumption in Indonesia a nd Thailand lifted growth.  More recently in 
July, trade balances generally improved from second-quarter levels, but industrial production was down in Malays ia, Singapore, and Thailand. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in  the region has generally moderated, but 
remains elevated due to higher food prices in  some countries as well as higher energy 
prices. Citing “subdued” inflation and the need to stimulate the domestic economy, Bank Indonesia cut its interest rate  50 basis points to 11.25 per cent on September 5 following a 
50 basis point reduction in early August.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to continued strength in economic activity.  Real GDP 
rose 6.1 percent in the second quarter.  The higher-than-expected performance was the 
result of strong automobile exports to the United States, a boom in construction, and solid 
agricultural production.  Indus trial production was down in July, but remains at an 
elevated level.  Twelve-month headline inflation was 3.5 percent in  August, within the 
target range of 2 to 4 percent.  On the political front, as widely  expected, in early 
September, Mexico’s highest electoral court unanimously declared conservative Felipe 
Calderon the official winner of the July 2 presidential election and formally named him 
president-elect.  Andres Manuel Lopez Obra dor, the leftist candidate, has refused to 
accept Calderon's victory; however, Lopez Obrador's belligerent position is losing support.  Calderon is scheduled to take office on December 1.

In Brazil , recent data indicate a softening in economic activity.  Real GDP growth 
dropped to 1.8 percent in the second quarter after spiking in  the first quarter.  Although 
private consumption picked up (supported in  part by a large increase in the minimum 
wage in April), investment declined sharpl y.  In addition, exports fell nearly 20 percent 
(a.r.) while imports held steady.  Industrial output recovered less than expected in July.  
On the bright side, indications are that domestic auto sales and production rebounded 
somewhat over July-August, with domestic sa les supported by the grea ter availability of 
consumer credit.  Headline consumer prices rose 3.8 percent over the twelve months 
ended August, the lowest rate since in flation targeting was introduced in 1999. 
 
On August 30, the central bank reduced its target rate anothe r 50 basis points to 
14.25 percent.  The target rate has fallen 550 basis points since the current easing phase 
began a year ago.  In early September, M oody’s raised its credit risk rating on Brazilian 
foreign currency bonds a notch to Ba2, citing advances in debt management.  Lula 
maintains a strong lead over his main chal lenger, conservative Geraldo Alckmin, ahead 
of the October 1 presidential election.

Indicators for Argentina  suggest growth will pick up in the second quarter, from the 
moderate pace in the first.  The second-quart er average of the index of economic activity 
(a monthly proxy for GDP) is more than 9 percen t (a.r.) above its firs t-quarter level.  The 
unemployment rate also declined in the s econd quarter.  In July, industrial production 
rose a more moderate 0.3 percent.  Twelve-m onth inflation remained elevated in August, 
but lower than last year, in part due to th e voluntary price agreements the government has 
secured in several sectors.

Venezuelan  real GDP soared an estimated 15 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter.  
Growth was led by the non-oil sectors, partic ularly construction, and has been fueled by 
extremely expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  Despite high oil prices, petroleum 
output rose only about 6 percent (a.r.) over the first half of  the year, reflecting problems 
at the state oil firm and the government’s hosti le approach to forei gn direct investment.  
Expansionary government policies are also boo sting inflation, which is up 15 percent 
over the 12 months ended August, despite the fixed exchange rate regime.  President 
Chavez is expected to win the December pres idential election, but hopes for a contested 
election have risen since August, when the us ually divided opposition surprisingly rallied 
around one candidate, Manuel Rosales, the governor of an oil-rich state.

Turkish  GDP grew at 7.4 percent in the sec ond quarter, supported by consumer and 
government spending and increased industria l output, and the current account deficit 
widened to almost 8 percent of GDP.  More recently, industrial production turned 
negative in July and twelve-month consumer pr ice inflation fell back to 10.3 percent in 
August, after reaching 11.7 percent in July, in dicating that policy rate increases totaling 
4.25 percentage points in June and July have had some success.  Turkey remains on-track 
with its IMF program, although EU accession ta lks may be stalled by slow reforms and 
concerns over human rights and relations with Cyprus.
