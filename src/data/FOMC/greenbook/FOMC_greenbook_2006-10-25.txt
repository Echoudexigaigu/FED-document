Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The broad picture of economic activity has not changed appreciably over the past month.  
Payroll employment has continued to rise  moderately on net, and spending on 
consumption and business fixed investment ha s held up well.  However, the increase in 
starts in September notwithstanding, the c ontraction in housing construction remains a 
significant drag on overall ac tivity, and industrial producti on has slackened noticeably 
since midyear, in part because of steep reduc tions in motor vehicle assemblies.  Energy 
prices dropped sharply in September and fell furt her in the first half of October, but core 
consumer price inflation remains elevated relative to readings from a year ago.  
 
Labor Market 
The demand for labor continued to increase in  September, although at a slower pace than 
in previous months according to the first es timate.  Private nonfarm payrolls rose 59,000 
in September after an upward-revised incr ease of 162,000 in August.  Employment gains 
in the service-producing sector were generally widespread la st month and were again led 
by an advance in health-care employment.  The construction industr y also added jobs, on 
net, with hiring in the nonres idential sector more than o ffsetting further losses in the 
residential sector.  In contra st, retail trade employment d ecreased again and now stands 
more than 100,000 below its year-earlier le vel.  Manufacturing employment also fell 
again in September, and job losses were wi despread across industries.  The average 
workweek was unchanged in September, and aggregate hours of production or 
nonsupervisory workers during the third quarter as a whole moved up at an annual rate of 
0.9 percent.  The unemployment rate ticked down in September for the second consecutive month, to 4.6 percent, the low end of a narrow band that  has prevailed since the beginning of the 
year.  Meanwhile, the labor fo rce participation rate remained at 66.2 percent.  The 
number of persons working part time for economic reasons—another indicator of labor 
market slack—has returned to its low sp ring level after ticking up this summer.
1  In 
addition, the number of job losers unemploye d less than five weeks (who account for the 
vast majority of those in transition from employment to unemployment) is very low. 
 Other indicators do not point to any significan t changes in labor market conditions.  The 
four-week moving average of initial clai ms for unemployment insurance (UI) was  
                                                
 
1 The category “working part time for economic r easons” measures employees  who are working part 
time because they are unable to find full-time jobs. This indicator  reflects economic slack because it 
captures individuals who would be willing to work more hours in response to employer demand; it is 
positively correlated with the unemployment rate.

313,000 in the week ending October 7, up just a l ittle from its trough earlier in the year, 
and the level of insured unemployment has also  barely risen from the low levels of the 
spring.  Layoff announcements moved up in September, largely on the news of cutbacks by domestic automobile manufacturers, but ma ny of these job cuts will take place over 
time or through attrition.  According to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, the 
rate of job openings has moved sideways th is year, and private surveys of hiring plans 
still suggest that labor dema nd is rising at a moderate pace.  Readings on households’ 
expectations for the labor ma rket remain mixed:  Responde nts to the Conference Board 
survey were relatively upbeat  through September, while the measure from the Michigan 
survey remained at a low level in early October.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has rel eased its preliminary es timate of the annual 
benchmark revision to the establishment survey  data, which indicates that the level of 
total nonfarm payroll employment in Marc h 2006 was 810,000, or 0.6 percent higher than 
previously reported.  This revision, which woul d be very large by historical standards, 
will be wedged-in between March 2005 and March 2006 when the BLS revises the employment data next February.  All else be ing equal, the benchmark revision would also 
boost the change in hours more than ½ percen tage point over the f our quarters ending in 
2006:Q1, and it would therefore lower productiv ity growth over this period from the 
currently published 2.7 per cent to about 2.1 percent.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) softened over the course of the thir d quarter after having posted 
brisk gains through midyear.  In September, total IP decreased 0.6 percent after having 
been unchanged in August.  September’s de cline reflected a sizable weather-related 
decrease in the output of u tilities and a fairly broad-ba sed decline of 0.3 percent in 
manufacturing output.  In contra st, output in the mining sector  more than reversed its  
                                                 
2 The benchmark revision will not affect the level of compensation in the national income and product 
accounts (NIPA) because the Bureau of Economic An alysis (BEA) has already incorporated the income-
related data from the state UI programs into its estimates.  However, the upward revision to hours would 
reduce compensation per hour.  Unit labor costs, which depend on output and compensation but not on 
hours, would be unaffected.

August drop, largely because of gains in cr ude oil extraction and in mined construction 
supplies such as stone, sand, and gravel.3 
 In September, capacity utilization in the ma nufacturing sector dec lined 0.4 percentage 
point to 80.8 percent, but was still 1 percen tage point above its average between 1972 and 
2005.  By stage of process, the utilization rate for industries at the crude stage edged up.  
The utilization rates for industries at the latter  stages of process moved down further from 
the highs recorded earlier in the summer, though they remained above their 1972-2005 averages.  The output of motor vehicles and parts fell 2.1 percent in September, as automakers continued to trim production of light trucks in response to bl oated inventories.  For the 
third quarter as a whole, motor vehicle out put was down 12 percent (annual rate) from its 
second-quarter level.  Elsewhere in tran sportation, commercial aircraft production 
continued to climb steadily, and orders for Bo eing aircraft remain robust.  Reflecting a 
strengthening in domestic demand, this year’s orders for Boeing aircraft are tracking only 
slightly behind the record-breaking pace reco rded in 2005.  Deliveries of Boeing’s single-
aisle workhorse, the 737, have increased mark edly, and the company is currently starting 
up production of the new 787 for delivery in mid-2008.  High-tech output increased at an annual rate of nearly 30 pe rcent in the third quarter, a 
noticeable step-up from the 20 percent rate during the second quarter.  The drivers of 
high-tech output growth switched in th e middle of 2006: Communications equipment 
production flattened out after a second-qua rter surge, while semiconductor output 
accelerated.  Semiconductor production rose 1.7 percent in September and was up nearly 
45 percent at an annual rate for the quarter as a whole.  Intel Co rporation’s introduction 
of faster, more energy-efficient microprocessors  (MPUs) late this summer led to a jump 
in their production, which accounted for the bulk of September’s increase in overall 
output of semiconductors.   The company’s revenue guidance for the fourth quarter—
roughly flat in nominal terms—is consistent  with another sizabl e gain in MPU output. 
 
                                                
 
3 British Petroleum (BP) brought three of its four eastern Prudhoe Bay pumping stations back on line 
in September, thereby boosting output at Prudhoe Bay to 90 percent of full capacity.  However, weather-related disruptions temporarily cut production during the second week of October.  BP expects production to reach full capacity within the next few months once a bypass for the damaged pipelines is complete.  
Next year, BP plans to replace most of its Prudhoe Ba y pipeline with narrower pipe that will maintain the 
current capacity but will be less prone to corrosion. 
II-10 
The IP index for computers continued to increase at a restrained rate in the third quarter.  
This estimate is based, in part, on project ions from the Gartner Group, which show a 
continued firming of business demand for server s and a slowing in un it sales of personal 
computers on the heels of a second-quarte r spurt.   Meanwh ile, the output of 
communications equipment rose only modestly  in the third quarter after having been 
boosted significantly in the first half of th e year by a major capital spending push among 
telecommunications service provid ers.  Regarding the outlook, CIO magazine’s diffusion 
index of plans for future spending on da ta networking and telecom equipment has 
dropped noticeably from the elevated readings  seen during the first half of the year. 
 Among market groups excluding energy, motor ve hicles and parts, and high-technology 
products, production was mixed in the third qua rter, as downstream categories performed 
somewhat better than upstream industries.  The output of consumer goods quickened in 
the third quarter, mainly because of a pickup in the production of consumer durables.  
The output of business equipment, which cont inues to benefit from both strong domestic 
orders and growing demand from abroad, advanced  at an annual rate of 14 percent in the 
third quarter after a similar increase in the second quarter.  The output of defense and 
space equipment continued to trend upward desp ite recent declines in military aircraft 
production.  In contrast, among upstream market groups, materials production 
decelerated further during the third quarte r, and the production of business supplies 
declined after having risen st eadily in the first half of  the year.  The output of 
construction supplies edged up dur ing the third quarter but was little changed from its 
level earlier in the year.  Recent indicators of near-term manufacturing activity have generally been a bit less 
positive than they were earlier in the year, but  they point to continued expansion in the 
coming months.  The Institute for Supply Management’s diffusion index for new orders held steady at 54.2 in September, a level c onsistent with continued modest gains in 
output.  Meanwhile, the three-month moving av erage of the staff’s measure of real 
adjusted durable goods orders has changed li ttle, on balance, of late.  Much of the 
softening in factory production in the past few months appear s to have been associated 
with the direct and indirect effects of sl ower homebuilding and, mo re importantly, with 
the inventory adjustment now under way in motor vehicle production.  More broadly, 
manufacturing inventories in the staff’s flow-of-goods inve ntory system appear well 
aligned with demand and provide little indica tion that other invent ory-related production 
cutbacks are in store for the months ahead.

Light Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light vehicles have continued to run at a moderate pace, while the Big Three 
manufacturers have slashed produc tion in an effort to reduce bloated inventories.  On the 
sales front, purchases were at an annual ra te of 16½ million units in both September and 
over the third quarter as a whole, a pace slight ly above that recorded in the second quarter 
and in the range that has prevailed for most of the past three years. Because of their 
ability to deliver more-competitive offerings w ithin the relatively fuel-efficient segments 
of cars and light sport-utility vehicles, the transplant firms continued to perform well 
against the Big Three in the third quarter, a nd the domestic market share has continued to 
erode.  More recently, sales at the three Japanese tr ansplant firms reportedly picked up a bit in 
the first ten days of October, while sales at  the Big Three may be running a bit below the 
September pace.  Meanwhile, assessments of car-buying conditions in the Michigan survey improved noticeably in early October, in part because of a lessening of concern 
about the price of gas.  No significant change s have been made in cash rebates and other 
incentive programs in recent weeks.  Light vehicle assemblies dropped in the thir d quarter by an annual rate of almost 
700,000 units, to 10.4 million units—the slowest pace in more than a decade—and are scheduled to remain at about this pace in  the fourth quarter.  The curtailment of 
production has been concentrated  in light trucks, where inve ntories remain persistently 
high, and has helped to lower days’ supply of a ll light vehicles from 75 days in June to 
70 days at the end of September.   If sales in the fourth qua rter match their third-quarter 
pace, the scheduled assembly rate would reduce days’ supply to the neighborhood of 
65 days by the end of the year, a number that would be in line with the industry-preferred 
norm. 
 
Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumption expenditures re gained some steam in September after a 
lackluster August and appear to have risen at  a moderate pace in the third quarter as a 
whole.  In part, the step-up in September re flected the monthly pattern of motor vehicle 
purchases.  In addition, we estimate that r eal spending on goods excl uding motor vehicles 
increased 0.7 percent last month after having risen only slightly, on net, over the summer; 
the rise in real spending in September was br oadly based and showed particular strength

in purchases of apparel.4  Real outlays for consumer serv ices posted a good-sized increase 
in July as a result of a weather-induced s purt in energy services, but they rose just 
0.1 percent in August (the most up-to-date da ta) as temperatures returned to seasonal 
norms; cooler-than-normal temperatures  likely held down expenditures on energy 
services in September.  Real disposable personal income (DPI) posted a solid increase in the first half of the year, 
mainly because of a surge in wages and salaries in the first quarter, and it appears to have 
moved up further in the third quarter.
5  Real DPI rose moderately in both July and 
August, reaching a level that was ¾ percen t above its second-quarter average, and it 
likely rose again in September in light of th e sharp drop in energy prices in that month.  
The personal saving rate is currently estimat ed to have edged up to negative 0.5 percent 
in August, a value similar to the aver age over the first half of the year. 
 Consumer spending continues to draw a good bi t of support from the lagged effects of the 
increases in household wealth over  the past two years.  As of  the second quarter, the ratio 
of household wealth to disposable income st ood at 5.60, well above its historical average; 
it probably remained in this area in the third quarter after factoring in both the rise in stock values and the apparent deceleration in house prices.  Meanwhile, borrowing costs have risen this year, on balance, fo r both short- and long-term loans. 
 The fragmentary information on consumer spending in October has been positive.  Sales at chain stores in the first half of the m onth were strong.  In addition, the preliminary 
October report from the University of Michig an points to a considerable improvement in 
consumer confidence, perhaps because of declining gasoline pri ces.  The sentiment 
measure from the Conference Board was little  changed in September and remained well 
within the favorable range that has been evident this year. 
                                                
 
4 Although sales at stores in the retail contro l group—which excludes au to dealers and building 
material stores—fell 0.6 percent in nominal terms in September, the steep drop in gasoline prices more than 
accounted for th e decline. 
5 The text refers to the published data on wages and salaries and DPI.  Although the anticipated upward 
revision to payroll employment by the BLS supports the idea that some of the surge in wages and salaries in the first quarter will be permanent, we continue to  judge that a substantial fraction reflected transitory 
factors, such as bonuses and stock op tions, that are unlikely to be repeated  in the subsequent few quarters.  
The first opportunity for such a reversal to appear in the data will be in late November, when the wage and 
salary data for the second quarter are benchmarked to UI tax records.  In our projection, we have assumed 
that the reversal will be concentrated in the third quarter.

Housing  
Despite some favorable incoming data, th e housing sector remains weak.  Although 
single-family starts rose to an annual rate of 1.43 million units in September, they were 
still about 20 percent below the peak seen in January.  In addition, adjusted permit 
issuance in this sector, which tends to be a more reliable indicator of the underlying pace 
of homebuilding, fell 6 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.24 million units, the 
lowest level in nearly five years.  Indeed, the gap between single-family starts and single-
family adjusted permits in September was the largest on record and points to a reversal of 
the September increase in starts.  In c ontrast, construction in the much smaller 
multifamily sector has continued to fluctuate within the range that has prevailed since 1995.  Sales of both new and existing homes have also dropped sharply since peaking last 
summer, but sales of existing single-family ho mes in August held stea dy at an annual rate 
of 5.5 million units, and sales of new home s edged up to an annual rate of about 
1.1 million units.  Moreover, the index of pe nding home sales—an indicator of future 
sales of existing homes—increased about 4 percent in August,  and the index of 
homebuying sentiment from the Michigan survey  jumped in October to its highest level 
in more than a year.  Recent declines in mortgage rates may provide some support to demand in the coming months: The average rate  for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages has 
fallen about 35 basis points since July, while th e average rate for one -year adjustable-rate 
mortgages has fallen more than 20 basis points.  Nonetheless, even a significant firming of de mand may—in the absence of further cuts in 
construction—be insufficient to rapidly el iminate the overhang of unsold homes.  
Reported inventories of unsold new homes have been increasing relative to sales for some time, and the months’ supply of new ho mes for sale is now more than 30 percent 
higher than the upper bound of the relatively  narrow (and historic ally low) range it 
occupied from 1997 to 2005.  In addition, th ese published inventory figures likely 
understate problems in the sector because they  do not include the e ffect of cancellations 
on the stock of unsold homes.  
 
 
 House-price appreciation has slowed from the elevated rates seen through last year. The 
purchase-only version of the price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO ) increased at an annual rate of just

5 percent in the second quarter, and the incr ease of 8 percent between the second quarter 
of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006 was the sm allest four-quarter change in nearly 
three years.  More recently, the Case-Shiller home-price index, which covers sales in only ten large U.S. cities, showed roughly no ne t change, on a seasonally adjusted basis, 
between January and July, and the average price of existing homes sold posted an 
outright decline over the twel ve months ending in August.
 6  However, unlike the OFHEO 
and Case-Shiller indexes, the series for the average price of existing homes sold does not 
control for changes in the average characte ristics of homes sold.  Thus, the abrupt 
downswing in this measure may reflect, in part , a shift in the composition of sales away 
from higher-end homes.  The rate of apprecia tion in new home pri ces has come down as 
well.  Moreover, homebuilders have reportedl y stepped up their use of incentives—such 
as paying closing costs, buying down mortgage  rates, and including optional items at no 
cost—to bolster sales.  If so, the deceler ation of new home prices may be more 
pronounced than the reported price data suggest.  
 
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software appears to have increased at a solid pace 
during the summer.  Shipments and orders of nondefense ca pital goods excluding aircraft 
increased in both July and August.  And for th e most part, the fundamental influences on 
equipment and software spending continue to look favorable.  Corporate financial 
reserves remain plentiful, and the cost of capital for high-tech goods  continues to fall—a 
trend that seems to have quickened in the third quarter as the pace of computer-price 
declines sped up and corporate bond rates droppe d.  That said, the step-down of late in 
the growth of business output suggests that  accelerator effects will be providing less 
impetus to investment in the future, and so me indicators of business conditions, including 
those from some of the Federal Reserve Banks and from the Institute for Supply Management, have edged down recently.  In the high-tech sector, orde rs and shipments of communicat ions equipment moved up in 
August.  The increase hinted that real outlays  in this sector may be stabilizing after a 
spectacular first-quarter incr ease that was only partially unw ound in the second quarter.  
Real computer spending is likel y to show a substantial pickup in the NIPA estimate for

Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington.

the third quarter in light of  the strong July and August shipments of computers as 
measured by the M3.7 
 In the transportation se ctor, real business purchases of motor vehicles have been brisk 
lately, in part because of a pull-forwar d of spending on medium and heavy trucks 
motivated by the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulations on truck emissions, 
which are scheduled to take effect in 2007.  De liveries of these trucks should remain at a 
high level through year-end, although the decline in orders in recent months points to a 
drop-off after the turn of the year.  Aircra ft shipments through A ugust (as estimated by 
the Census Bureau) and information on Boeing deliveries suggest that  domestic aircraft 
outlays have picked up somewhat from th eir extremely low second-quarter level. 
 Real spending on equipment other than high tech and transportation appears to have 
retained considerable momentum in the thir d quarter.  Shipments in this broad category 
rose 0.7 percent in August on top of the 1.4 percent increase posted in July, and robust 
orders in recent months sugge st that further increases in shipments are in store for the 
months ahead. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Activity in the nonresidential construction sector  continued to strength en in August.  The 
recovery in manufacturing construction th at began midway through 2004 has spread to 
the rest of nonresidential stru ctures, and all the major categor ies of construction have now 
shown sustained increases in spending.  Nonethel ess, the vacancy rate in the retail sector 
has been essentially flat at a low level for some time now, and vacancy rates remain high 
in the office and industrial categories.
 8  Forward-looking indicators suggest that outlays 
on nonresidential construc tion will continue to rise over the next few quarters, although 
perhaps not as rapidly as they have so far this year.  The three- month moving average of 
the architectural billings index has strengt hened significantly in recent months after 
dipping in the early summer and now shows that  more architectural firms are reporting  
                                                 
7 The BEA still puts some weight (25 percent) on the M3 series when measuring computer 
expenditures, although it now gives the majority of the weight (75 percent) to the IP index for computers.  
As noted earlier, the IP index of computer production continued to show relatively sluggish growth in the third quarter. 
8 The vacancy rates for the office and industrial sect ors plotted in the figure are estimates by Costar. 
Torto Wheaton Research reported more-significant declin es in these vacancy rates than the Costar data 
indicate, although the levels of the Torto Wheaton seri es were higher in the second quarter than the Costar 
estimates.  The Torto Wheaton data are based on a la rger sample of areas and property types but are much 
less timely and appear to be of somewhat lower quality than Costar’s.

A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, orwhen the first 3 days of a month are nonworking days.  Outlays for defense, Social Security,Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.  In addition,defense outlays for retiree health care have been converted from an annual to a monthly basis. For August2006, receipts and outlays have been adjusted to reflect a one-time accounting correction by the Treasurythat reduced both individual income taxes and Social Security benefits by $6 billion.

increases in billings than are reporting decreases. 9  In addition, total employment in the 
nonresidential buildings and nonresidential specialty trade categories has continued to 
move up in recent months.  In the drilling and mining sect or, the increase in the tota l number of rigs drilling for 
natural gas or petroleum through the end of Se ptember suggests that outlays continued to 
rise rapidly in the third quarter.  The nu mber of active rigs did tick down in early 
October, but energy prices remain high enough that drilling activity is likely to remain 
strong. 
 
Business Inventories  
The pace of real inventory accumulation outside  the motor vehicle sector moved up to an 
annual rate of nearly $50 billion in the second quarter, and book-value data through 
August suggest that the rate of  stockbuilding remained substa ntial in the th ird quarter.  
Broad measures of months’ supply outside of the motor vehicle sector, including the 
staff’s flow-of-goods inventor y system, suggest that inve ntories are generally well 
aligned with demand.  Although the Septembe r survey from the Institute for Supply 
Management indicated a noticea ble rise in the number of  respondents who think their 
customers’ inventories are too high, two-thir ds of respondents remain comfortable with 
their customers’ inventory positions.    
Federal Government Sector  
As a result of an exceptionally sharp increase in receipts in September, the unified budget 
deficit for fiscal year 2006 came in at  $248 billion, down from $319 billion in the 
2005 fiscal year.  Outlays rose about in line with nominal GDP in fiscal 2006, but 
receipts rose much more ra pidly, and the deficit fell from 2½ percent of GDP in 2005 to 
2 percent of GDP in 2006.  Tax receipts in the July to September peri od stood 10 percent above the year-ear lier level 
after adjusting for shifts in payment timing.  Corporate collections (mainly the estimated 
payments that were due on September 15) pos ted another enormous increase, apparently 
because of both strong gains in corporate pr ofits and other factors, including unusually

taxes also remained quite strong, while withhe ld taxes fell a bit s hort of the gains in 
wages and salaries over the past year.  Outlays in the July to September period, ad justed for shifts in payment timing, rose 
8 percent from the year-earlier comparable pe riod.  One factor that  boosted spending over 
this period was a one-time jump of $12 billion in outlays recorded by the Department of 
Education in September.  The jump stemmed from a re-estimate of the subsidy costs of 
the student loan program.  More generally, though, the underlying rise  in outlays appears 
to have eased a bit of late as increases in  defense spending and in Medicare expenditures 
(after accounting for the prescrip tion drug benefit) have slowed. 
  On the legislative front, the Congress ha s passed just two of the twelve regular 
appropriations bills: defense and homeland se curity.  The defense appropriation provides 
$447 billion in budget authority for fiscal  2007, including $70 billion of emergency 
funding (a $50 billion “down payment” for this  year’s spending in Iraq and Afghanistan 
and $20 billion for repair and acquisition of e quipment).  The bill also provides for an 
increase of 6 percent in non-emergency defense funding.  The homeland security bill 
contains an 8 percent boost in budget authority; this increas e is somewhat larger than 
what the President had requested, mainly because the Congress added emergency funds 
for border fencing and border-control agents.  Before the Congress went into recess on 
September 29, it passed a continuing resolu tion to provide funding through November 17 
for other programs normally covered under the annual appropriations process.  At this 
point, discretionary spending for fiscal 2007 a ppears set to exceed the rather stringent 
limits adopted by the Congress last spring, in part because of the additional $20 billion for repair and acquisition of military equipment and the $2 billion in emergency funds for homeland security. 
 
State and Local Government Sector  
Real purchases by state and local governments a ppear to have risen just modestly in the 
third quarter after having posted a sizable incr ease over the first half  of the year.  The 
slowing was concentrated in construction spe nding, which has been little changed in real 
terms since midyear after having surged over th e first half.  Employment growth has been 
uneven of late, in part because  of shifts in hiring around the start of the school year; in 
general, though, employment has continued to  expand at about the gradual pace that has 
been evident since the start of 2004.

State and local revenue flows ha ve continued to exhibit consid erable vigor.  According to 
the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue, state revenues 
during the year ending in the second quarter—w hich was equivalent to fiscal year 2006 
for most states—were 9 percent above their ye ar-earlier level.  As was the case at the 
federal level, second-quarter  receipts were boosted subs tantially by both continued 
strength in corporate income taxes and a la rge increase in nonwit hheld personal income 
tax payments.10  Revenues received by local governm ents rose 7 percen t during the year 
ending in the second quarter, a bout the same rate as during th e comparable period in each 
of the preceding two years.  
Prices  
The consumer price index declined 0.5 per cent in September as energy prices fell 
sharply; prices excluding food and energy ro se 0.2 percent for th e third consecutive 
month.  Given the available data, we estimate that core prices for personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) also rose 0.2 percent la st month, which leaves the three-month 
change in September at 2.2 percent at an annual rate—down from a high of 2.9 percent in 
May.  We estimate that core PCE prices in creased 2.4 percent over the twelve months 
ending in September, 0.3 percentage point hi gher than the increas e recorded during the 
preceding twelve-month period.  The pickup in core PCE inflation over the past  year has been con centrated in shelter 
costs, which have accelerated nearly 2 percentage points.
11  However, shelter costs have 
slowed considerably in the past few mont hs, rising just 0.3 percent in both August and 
September after five consecutive months of in creases of either 0.4 percent or 0.5 percent.  
Core goods price inflation was little changed in  the past year, as a noticeable acceleration 
in prices for apparel and a number of other nondurable goods was offset by a deceleration 
in the prices of a wide variety of durable goods.  We estimate that the PCE price index for food and beverages increased 0.2 percent in 
September, as a sizable increase in the index fo r fruits and vegetables was partly offset by 
a smaller-than-normal rise in the index for f ood away from home.  The spot prices of 
wheat and corn have risen rapidly of late, but so far these increases have had little effect  
                                                
 
10 The breakdown of personal income taxes into their withheld and nonwithheld components is 
provided by the Rockefeller Institute’s State Revenue Report . 
11 The core CPI has accelerated more than the core PCE price index over  the past year, largely because 
shelter is given a larger weight in the CPI.

on food prices for consumers.  Over the past year, food prices have risen 2½ percent, a 
slightly larger increase than in the previous year.  We estimate that PCE energy prices declin ed 8 percent in September and stood about 
4¾ percent below their year-earlier level.  Re tail gasoline prices have fallen especially 
rapidly as a result of both th e fall in crude oil costs and a sharp narrowing of the margin 
between retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices.  The narrowing of this margin was caused by a glut of gasoline inventories,  which had been accumulated by wholesalers 
earlier this year as a precau tion against possible hurricane-r elated supply disruptions or 
distribution problems related to  ethanol-based gasoline.  However, these disruptions 
failed to materialize, and in early October gasoline inventories reached a sixteen-year 
seasonal high, thereby putting downward pressure on retail prices and total margins.  In 
all, retail gasoline prices were down 13 per cent in September, and preliminary survey 
information points to another big drop in October.  Natural gas inventories also continued to accumulate rapidly through early October and 
now stand at their highest level in twelve year s.  This inventory s ituation has caused spot 
prices of natural gas to plummet, and by early  October they were at a four-year low.  
Because residential rate s (which are typically regulated by state commissions) tend to lag 
behind changes in the spot pri ce, the drop in spot prices had little effect on consumer 
prices for natural gas in September, but it shou ld show through more clearly in October.  
 With the sharp decline in consumer gasoline pr ices, near-term inflati on expectations have 
eased substantially afte r spiking up in August.  The Mich igan Survey Research Center 
reported that in early October, median one -year inflation expectations moved down to 
2.9 percent, while median five- to ten-year expectations edged up 0.1 percentage point, to 
3.1 percent—well within the narrow range seen  over the past year.  As of October 17, 
inflation compensation implied by rate sp reads on nominal and CPI-indexed Treasury 
bonds was about 2.2 percent for five-year ma turities and about 2.6 percent at longer 
horizons, after adjusting for carry effects.  Th ese figures are a shade lower than those in 
the September Greenbook.  Turning to prices at earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core 
intermediate materials rose only 0.1 percen t in September, well below the 0.7 percent 
average monthly rate for the preceding twelve months.  This reading reflected a drop in

Expected Inflation  
In the September Greenbook, we introduced a new exhibit showing three types of 
measures of expected inflation.  To recap, th e top two panels show the median responses 
to two familiar questions from the Michigan Survey Research Center : one about inflation 
twelve months ahead and one about inflation five to ten years ahea d.  The questions are 
asked of approximately 500 households per mont h and do not refer to any particular price 
index.  (Specifically, the ques tions ask, “By about what per cent [per year] do you expect 
prices to go up/down, on the averag e, during the next twelve m onths [five to ten years]?”) 
 
The middle panels show two series that are important inputs into our inflation models: 
The FRB/US long-run expectations measures for CPI inflation and a distributed lag of 
core CPI inflation.  The FRB/US variable is constructed by splicing together three 
different series: for 1991 forward, the median  projection for CPI inflation over the next 
ten years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia; for 1981 through 1991, a related survey conducted by Richard 
Hoey, of Drexel Burnham Lambert; a nd for years preceding 1981, a model-based 
estimate constructed by the Board staff.  The distributed-lag measure is derived from one 
of the staff’s reduced-form Phillips curve models of core CPI inflation; multiplying the 
lagged inflation terms by the estimated coeffi cients on those terms (which are constrained 
to sum to 1) generates the measure shown.  This distributed lag, although not a direct 
measure of expected inflation, is highly correlated with actual inflation and likely 
includes an important expectations component. 
 
Finally, in the bottom pair of panels, we show two series for inflation compensation 
derived from a comparison of yields on nomi nal Treasury securities  with yields from 
Treasury inflation-protected secu rities (TIPS).  These series, one for the next five years 
and one for five to ten years ahead, provide  a market-derived measure of expected 
inflation, albeit one that also  includes premiums for liquid ity and for inflation risk.  
Beginning with March 2004, the series on inflat ion compensation over the next five years 
is adjusted for the indexation-lag effect.

crude materials reflected a large pickup in prices of aluminum and steel scrap, while 
prices turned down for crude ma terials used in construction. 
 More recently, the Journal of Commerce  metals index has risen 7¾ percent since the time 
of the September Greenbook; the jump reflects sizable increase s for a number of metals.  
However, the foodstuffs index from the Comm odities Research Bureau fell ½ percent 
from its mid-September level, while spot prices  of construction materials such as lumber, 
plywood, and fiberboard have turned dow n sharply since the September Greenbook. 
 
Labor Costs  
The BLS’s preliminary estimate of the be nchmark revision to payroll employment 
implies a downward revision of slightly more th an ½ percentage point to the increase in 
compensation per hour over the four quart ers ending in 2006:Q1.  Nonetheless, at 
5¾ percent, the increase is still large.  The only timely information on wages is for 
average hourly earnings, which rose 0.2 per cent in both August and September after a 
larger increase in July.   Average hourly ea rnings rose 4 percent over the twelve months 
ending in September, compared with an in crease of 2¾ percent over the preceding year.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Policy expectations were unchanged in the near term, but edged up beyond mid-2007 
amid mixed economic news and FOMC commun ications that were taken to suggest 
greater concern about inflation risks.  Nominal and inflation- indexed Treasury yields both 
increased a bit on balance, leaving implied measures of inflation compensation little 
changed.  Equity prices rose about 4 per cent, boosted by the su rprising resilience of 
corporate profits and perhaps also by the eff ects of lower spot oil prices on the economic 
outlook.  Risk spreads on investment-g rade bonds were about unchanged over the 
intermeeting period, while speculative-grade sp reads narrowed a little.  The available 
indicators suggest that household credit quality  remained favorable, on the whole, despite 
the continuing deceleration in home prices; bus iness credit quality also remained strong.  
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The decision at the September FOMC meeti ng to leave the target federal funds rate 
unchanged and to retain the forward-looking la nguage from the previous statement was 
largely anticipated, and elicite d little market reaction.  Earl y in the intermeeting period, 
some weaker-than-expected data releases pushed the expected path of policy beyond the 
near term substantially lower.  However, this  move was subsequently more than reversed, 
as investors apparently in terpreted comments by severa l FOMC officials and the 
September FOMC minutes as suggesting that  the Committee was more concerned about 
the risks to the inflation outlook and less wo rried about a slowdown in economic growth 
than had been thought.  In addition, a few subsequent data releases, including the 
announcement of an upcoming upward revision to payroll data, boosted policy expectations.  Investors con tinue to expect the Committee to leave the target federal 
funds rate unchanged through the end of the year. The expected path for policy 
incorporates about ½ percenta ge point of policy easing next  year, a bit less than was 
expected at the time of the last FOMC meeti ng.  Measures of uncertainty about the future 
path of policy, as derived from options on Eurodollar futures contracts, remain near 
historical lows.    Nominal two-year Treasury yields largely tracked policy expectations, rising 5 basis 
points, on net, over the intermeeting period; te n-year yields increa sed 4 basis points.  
After adjusting for carry effects, yields on Treasury inflation-protec ted securities (TIPS) 
rose a bit more, leaving TIPS-based measures  of inflation compen sation a tad lower, on 
net, amid a moderate decline in spot o il prices.  Near-term inflation compensation 
remains near the low end of its recent range.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes gained about 4 pe rcent on net, boosted in itially by an unusually 
small number of earnings warnings in advanc e of the earnings reporting season and later 
by actual reports, the vast majority of which b eat analysts’ forecasts.  Investors may also 
have been encouraged by continued declines in  spot oil prices.  W ith the rise in stock 
prices, the twelve-month forward trend-earnin gs to price ratio for S&P 500 firms inched 
down, and its spread over a long-run real Tr easury yield, a rough measure of the equity 
risk premium, narrowed a bit.  Implied volatility on the S&P 500 index continued to 
hover close to its historical lows.    Over the intermeeting period, yields on inve stment-grade corporate bonds moved roughly 
in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving risk spreads moderately above their lows in the past couple  of years.  A small decline in yields on 
speculative-grade bonds narrowed their spreads a little.  Ri sk spreads on commercial 
paper, measured by the difference between yi elds on thirty-day A2/P2 and A1/P1 paper, 
remained low.   
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Through mid-October, nearly 100 firms in  the S&P 500 had reported third-quarter 
earnings, and thus far very few have come in s hort of expectations.  On the basis of these 
reports and analysts’ estimates for the remain ing firms, we project  that third-quarter 
earnings per share for the S&P 500 have increased  about 15 percent from a year earlier, a 
pace roughly on par with that in the second quarter.  Such a result would imply a very 
modest gain from the second quarter level on a seasonally adjusted basi s.  Over the past 
few weeks, analysts’ forecasts  of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms continued to be 
revised down, on balance, but this was largely due to reduced energy-sector forecasts.  Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to be solid.  Although balance 
sheet liquidity declined further in the s econd quarter, it remained high by historical 
standards, and corporate leverage was uncha nged at low levels.  Bond rating downgrades 
during the third quarter were moderate and mainly reflected the July and September 
downgrades of Ford Motor Company, while bond  upgrades were minimal.  The realized 
six-month trailing bond default ra te was near zero again in September, and the near-term 
outlook for credit quality remained favorable, as the forecast of the aggregate year-ahead 
default rate based on the KMV model hovered around the bottom of its historical range.

Business Finance 
In September and early October, gross bond i ssuance was robust, but the rate remained 
below the torrid pace of the firs t half of the year.  Investment-grade firms accounted for 
about 60 percent of third-quarter issuance.  A substantial share of firms continued to 
report using bond proceeds for refinancings and mergers and acquisitions.  C&I loans 
slowed markedly in September, while commercial paper outstanding was about 
unchanged.  On balance, net de bt financing for September and the third quarter as a 
whole was strong, though well off its very rapi d pace in the first half of the year.   
 After a sluggish summer, both IPOs and seasone d equity offerings picked up a bit in the 
second half of September and early October,  while private equity issuance appears to 
have remained vigorous due to investments by buyout and venture capital firms.  Even 
so, gross equity issuance continued to be dw arfed by equity retirements, which have been 
boosted by strong profits and ample cash positio ns on corporate balance sheets.  In the 
third quarter, retirements from share repur chases and those from cash-financed mergers 
and acquisitions are estimated to have about  matched their extrao rdinary first-half 
volumes.  Overall, net equity  issuance appears to have re mained deeply negative.   
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage borrowi ng was strong in the second qu arter; recent data suggest 
borrowing eased somewhat in the third quarter, pe rhaps reflecting the rise in interest rates 
on commercial mortgages and the net tightening of standards for these loans reported on 
the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey.  Despite this move toward tightening 
by banks, spreads of yields on investment -grade CMBS over those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities have held stea dy at low levels in recent months.  The credit 
quality of commercial mortgages has remained  strong, with delinquency rates at historic 
lows in the second quarter.  Commercial propert y prices continued to  increase rapidly in 
the second quarter, and an additional mode st rise in rents pointed to continued 
improvement in market fundamentals.  
Household Finance 
Interest rates on new home mortgages were li ttle changed, on net,  over the intermeeting 
period.  In the second quarter, the growth of  home mortgage debt from a year earlier 
slowed further; on a quarter-to-quarter basis,  the growth rate was 9 percent at an annual 
rate, the lowest seen in more than five years.   We have little hard data in hand for the 
third quarter, but we expect some further moderation because of the continued

deceleration of house prices.  Meanwhile, year-over-year growth in consumer credit 
remained modest through August. 
 Overall household debt expanded more rapidly than disposable income in the second 
quarter, pushing the financial obligations ra tio to another new high.  Nonetheless, 
households generally do not appear to be  having trouble meeting their obligations.  
Delinquency rates on credit cards, auto loan s, and prime mortgages remain low; the 
delinquency rate on subprime mortgages crep t up further in August but remained well 
within the range seen over the past several years.  The pace of personal bankruptcy filings 
continued to be subdued over the intermeeting period.  House prices posted their sma llest increase in several year s in the second quarter, and 
monthly indicators imply a further deceleration in the third quarter.  Futures quotes continue to imply an outright price declin e in coming quarters in  ten of the largest 
markets, but they do not indica te that market participants have become markedly more 
pessimistic over the intermeeting period.  The available data on house prices, stock 
prices, and income suggest that the ratio of  household net worth to disposable personal 
income was little changed in the third quarter.   
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury auctioned two- and five-yea r nominal coupon securi ties and reopened the 
ten-year TIPS during the intermeeting period.  These auctions were reportedly well 
received, with above-average bid-to-cover ra tios suggesting overall  strong demand for 
those securities.  Indirect bidding, which may in  part reflect demand fr om foreign official 
institutions, was also robust.  Following st rong mid-September tax receipts, issuance of 
four-week Treasury bills has been lower than ex pected, but bid-ask spre ads in that market 
were unaffected.  Similarly, liquidity in th e note and bond markets has continued to be 
ample, as both bid-ask spreads and trading volumes have remained within their recent 
ranges.  Net agency debt issuance has been light, as  Fannie Mae and Fre ddie Mac continued to 
reduce their mortgage port folios through August.  On September 29, the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight a nnounced that the two government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs) were adequately capitalized  as of June 30 and also announced a five-
year plan to enhance its supervision of th e GSEs.  Stock prices of both Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac rose over the intermeeting period, likely boosted in part by Freddie Mac’s

State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds decl ined in September, mainly because of a 
substantial drop in advance re fundings, but issuance for th e third quarter as a whole 
remained robust.  Issuance of short-term municipal bonds also declined in September, as 
it typically does early in the fiscal year.  The credit quality of municipal bonds continue d to be solid.  During the third quarter, the 
number of bonds with rating upgrades agai n far outpaced the number with downgrades, 
and the ratio of municipal bond yields to Treasuries remained low.  
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 grew at an annual rate of  3¾ percent during the third quarter.  The slow growth is in 
line with apparently weak nominal GDP growth  in the quarter and the lagged effects of 
rising short-term interest rates earlier in the year.  Liquid deposits—rates on which adjust 
quite sluggishly to changes in market rates— continued to run off last quarter, and the 
currency component of M2 was flat owing to  low foreign demand for U.S. dollars.  In 
contrast, growth of small time deposits and of retail money funds, whose yields tend to 
rise with market rates, remained strong.  Commercial bank credit decelerated marked ly over August and September, trimming 
third-quarter growth to 8¼ percent, down from the 12 percent annual pace during the first 
half of the year.  The slowdown was due to a run-off in securities and a step-down in the 
growth of loans late in th e quarter.  C&I loans—after soaring in July and August—
decelerated sharply to a 3¼ percent annual rate  in September, with widespread weakness 
reported across the different bank categories.  Commercial real estate loans also slowed 
over August and September, a pattern consiste nt with the weakening of demand and the 
tightening of credit standards for such loans re ported in the October Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey.  On the household side, reside ntial real estate loans ran off again in 
September, while consumer loans orig inated by banks expanded moderately.

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The October 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  Special questions in the survey queried banks about the extent to which the recent st rength in commercial and industrial lending 
reflected a surge in loans to fund merger and acquisition activity.  This appendix is 
based on responses from fifty-five domestic  banks and seventeen foreign banking 
institutions.  Overall, the respondents noted mixed chang es in lending standards and terms over the 
past three months, while demand for most lo an types reportedly declined somewhat.  
Both domestic and foreign institutions indi cated that they had eased lending terms on 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the previous three months, while credit 
standards on such loans had changed little.  Domestic banks, however, reported that 
they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the previous three months.  Demand for C&I loans at domestic institutions was reportedly little 
changed in the October survey, while dema nd for commercial real estate loans at these 
institutions weakened over the past three months.  In the household sector, respondents generally reported no change in credit standa rds on residential mortgage loans over the 
survey period, while demand for such loans continued to weaken.  Standards and terms 
on credit card and non-credit-card consumer loans were also little changed, but a considerable net fraction of domestic institu tions indicated that they had experienced 
weaker demand for consumer loans over the previous three months.    
Business Lending  
In the October survey, domestic institutions reported that credit standards on C&I loans 
to large and middle-market firms were uncha nged, on net, over the past three months.  
On balance, however, domestic respondents indicated that they had further eased terms on C&I loans to such firms over the same period.  Almost one-third of respondents—a somewhat smaller net fraction than in the July survey—noted that they had trimmed 
spreads of loan rates over their cost of f unds over the past three months, while nearly 
one-fifth of banks—about the same net percenta ge as in the previous survey—reported 
that they had reduced the costs of credit lines.  About 10 percent of domestic respondents, on net, indicated that they had eased loan covenants.  Credit standards on C&I loans to small firms were also reportedly little changed, on net, 
in the October survey.  However, one-thi rd of domestic institutions, on balance, 
indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the

previous three months, and nearly one-fifth of respondents noted that they had reduced 
the costs of credit lines.               At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign ba nks, only two institutions reported that they 
had eased their standards on C&I loans during the survey period.  Considerable net fractions of these institutions, however, indicated  that they had trimmed spreads of loan 
rates over their cost of funds and reduced the cost of credit lines.      All domestic and foreign respondents that reported having eased their lending standards 
or terms in the October survey pointed to more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important  reason for having done so.  Notable net 
fractions of domestic institutions also cite d increased liquidity in the secondary market 
for these loans, a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, and a reduction in defaults by borrowers in public debt markets as reasons for having eased credit 
standards or terms on C&I loans.  At domestic banks, demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms was reportedly little changed, on balance, in the October survey.  About 15 percent of these 
institutions, on net, indicated that they ha d experienced weaker demand for such loans 
from small firms over the previous three months.  At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, nearly one-fifth of respondents,  on balance, reported that they had seen 
weaker demand for C&I loans over the same period.  All of the domestic institutions that experienced weaker demand for C&I loan s attributed the softening, in part, to 
borrowers’ decreased needs to fi nance investment in plant or equipment.  Considerable 
fractions of respondents also cited borrowers ’ decreased financing needs for inventories 
and accounts receivable, as well as increases in customers’ internally generated funds, as reasons for weaker loan demand.  Am ong domestic banks that saw stronger demand 
for C&I loans, three-fourths pointed to a rise in merger and acquisition (M&A) activity 
as a reason for stronger loan demand, while two-thirds cited borrowers’ increased needs 
to finance inventories.                Regarding future business, about 10 percent of  domestic institutions, on net, and nearly 
20 percent of foreign respondents reported that the number of inquiries from potential 
business borrowers had decreased moderate ly over the previous three months. 
 Nearly 40 percent of domestic institutions—a not ably larger net fraction than in the July 
survey—indicated that they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate 
loans over the previous three months.  Mo re than one-fourth of domestic respondents—
also a larger net percentage than in th e previous survey—reported that they had 
experienced weaker demand for such loans over the same period.  By contrast, both 
 III-A-5   
 
 
lending standards and demand for commercial r eal estate loans at foreign institutions 
were little changed in the October survey. The October survey included a set of special  questions about the extent to which the 
recent strength in C&I lending has reflected  a surge in loans to fund M&A activity.
1 
Holdings of C&I loans originated for M& A-related purposes were generally small for 
the respondent banks.2  About one-half of domestic institutions indicated that M&A-
related C&I loans accounted for less than 5 percent of the loans currently on their 
books, and roughly one-third of banks noted that such loans accounted for between 5 
percent and 10 percent of their loans.  The remainder of banks—except for one 
institution—reported a share that w as between 11 percent and 30 percent. 3  On average, 
those banks with larger C&I loan portfolios had higher M&A loan concentrations.  As a 
result, when the responses are weighted by th e dollar volume of C&I loans at the end of 
the second quarter, banks that reported an M&A share of less than 5 percent accounted for only about one-third of all C&I loan s on the books of banks responding to this 
special question.  At U.S. branches and ag encies of foreign banks, more than one-half 
of respondents indicated that the share of M&A-related C&I loans was 10 percent or less, while almost one-third noted that the share was between 11 percent and 20 percent. 
 The remainder of foreign banks reported a share that was between 21 percent and 40 
percent. In contrast to the domestic ba nks, foreign banks with larger C&I loan 
portfolios had somewhat smaller M&A loan  concentration on average:  When the 
responses are weighted by the dollar volume of C&I loans, foreign institutions that 
reported an M&A share of 10 percent or less accounted for 65 percent of all C&I loans on the books of respondent institutions.  One-half of domestic respondents and roughl y 60 percent of foreign respondents, on 
balance, reported that the share of M&A -related C&I loans on their books had increased 
over the past twelve months.  When the responses are weighted by C&I loans, these 
                                                 
1 The number of domestic banks that responded to  these special questions varied from ten to 
fifty-four depending on the question.  Acco rding to second-quarter Call Reports, these 
respondents accounted for between 12 percent and 56 percent of all C&I loans on the books of domestic commercial banks as of June 30, 2006.   The number of foreign institutions that 
responded to these special questions varied fro m two to seventeen depending on the question.  
As of June 30, 2006, the foreign respondents acc ounted for between 10 percent and 48 percent of 
all C&I loans on the books of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.     
2 In the survey, M&A-related C&I loans were defined as those made to finance leveraged 
buyouts and other M&A activity. 
3 A similar question regarding the share of C&I loans on banks’ books that were merger related 
was asked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when  M&A activity was strong.  On average, the 
fraction of institutions that reported shares of 10 percent or less was smaller than in the current 
survey, while the fraction of banks that indicat ed shares between 11 percent and 20 percent was 
significantly larger. 
 III-A-6   
 
 
institutions accounted for 70 percent and a bout 85 percent, respectively, of loans 
outstanding at the end of the second quarter.        Among the domestic institutions that experi enced an increase in the share of M&A-
related C&I loans over the past twelve mont hs, one-third indicated that this increase 
reflected to a moderate extent a shift of funding for M&A activity to banks as a result of a reduction in the relative attractiveness of bond finance.  Eighty percent of these institutions pointed to relatively more favorable nonprice terms as a reason for the shift of M&A financing out of the bond market, wh ile 60 percent pointed to relatively more 
favorable pricing in the loan market.  Only two of the foreign respondents that experienced an increase in the share of M&A -related C&I loans pointed to a shift of 
funding for M&A activity from the bond market to banks as a reason for the increase.    Domestic respondents generally reported that  the share of M&A-related C&I loans on 
their books that were used to finance le veraged buyouts was fairly small.  Roughly 
three-fourths of institutions indicated that  this share was less than or equal to 10 
percent, and only about one-tenth of domes tic banks reported that this share was 
between 51 percent and 75 percent.
 4  These fractions are roughly similar if the 
responses are weighted by the respondents’  C&I loans.  The shares of C&I loans 
accounted for by leveraged buyouts were larger on average at the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Nonetheless, nearly one-half of the foreign respondents reported that the share was less than or e qual to 10 percent, and about one-third of 
respondents indicated that the share was between 11 percent and 50 percent.
5  On 
average, foreign respondents with larger C&I loan portfolios had somewhat larger 
fractions of their M&A-related lo ans devoted to leveraged buyouts. 
 Domestic respondents generally reported that  the share of M&A-related C&I loans on 
their books that were bridge loans was qu ite small:  Ninety percent of domestic 
institutions reported that this share was less than or equal to 10 percent.
6  Again, these 
shares were higher at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, where nearly two-
                                                 
4 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the share of merger-related C&I loans used to finance 
leveraged buyouts was reportedly considerably higher.   Banks that indicated a share of less than 
20 percent accounted for as little as 5 percent of  all respondents in February 1989 and for as 
much as 40 percent in March 1991.  Banks that  indicated a share of more than 80 percent 
accounted for as little as 15 percent of all re spondents in March 1991 and for as much as 30 
percent in February 1988. 
5 Two foreign respondents noted that the share of M&A-related C&I loans on their books that 
were used to finance leveraged buyouts was more than 75 percent.  These institutions, however, accounted for only 1 percent of all C&I loans on the books of the foreign banks that responded to this special question. 
6 In the survey, bridge loans were defined as t hose loans that banks expected to be paid down 
with funds raised in capital markets within the next twelve months.  
 III-A-7   
 
 
thirds of respondents indicated that the share of such loans was 10 percent or less, while 
30 percent of respondents noted that this sh are was between 11 percent and 50 percent.  
On balance, about 15 percent of domestic in stitutions reported that they had tightened 
credit standards for approving applications for M&A-related C&I loans or credit lines 
over the past twelve months.  These respondents, however, indicated that they had also eased some terms on such loans or credit lin es over the same period:  Nearly one-third 
of domestic respondents, on net, indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds, and 15 percent noted that they had reduced the costs of credit lines.  At foreign institutions, about one-four th of respondents reported that they had 
eased credit standards for approving applicati ons for M&A-related C&I loans or credit 
lines over the past twelve months.  Notable net fractions of foreign respondents also 
indicated that they had increased the maximu m size of loans or credit lines, reduced the 
costs of credit lines, and eased loan covenants.  About one-fourth of domestic respondents indicated that they anticipate that the quality of M&A-related C&I loans currently on th eir books will deteriorate over the next 
twelve months, and the rest expect that loan quality will likely stabilize around current levels.  A somewhat larger net fracti on of domestic respondents—about 35 percent—
reported that they expect the quality of thei r C&I loans that were not used to finance 
M&A activity to deteriorate over the same period.
7  However, when the responses to 
these two special questions are weighted by the dollar volume of C&I loans at the end of the second quarter, the institutions that anticipated a deterioration in the credit 
quality accounted for about 45 percent and 35 pe rcent, respectively, of all C&I loans 
held by respondent banks.  At foreign ins titutions, 35 percent of respondents indicated 
that they anticipate that the quality of M& A-related C&I loans currently on their books 
will deteriorate over the next twelve months, while 30 percent indicated that they expect 
that the quality of their C&I loans that we re not used to finance M&A activity will 
deteriorate over the same period.  These shares are broadly similar if the responses are weighted by the respondents’ C&I loans outstanding. 
                                                 
7 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, banks that had charged off merger-related C&I loans were 
asked to compare the chargeoff rate on such lo ans with that on comparably seasoned C&I loans 
that were not merger related.  In the survey  conducted in February 1987, a considerable net 
fraction of banks—about 75 percent—reported that  the chargeoff rate on merger-related C&I 
loans was somewhat or much lower than that on other comparable C&I loans.  The net fraction 
of banks giving a similar answer declined notably over subsequent surveys.  In March 1991, about 20 percent of respondents, on net, indicated  that the chargeoff rate on merger-related C&I 
loans was somewhat or much higher than the ch argeoff rate on comparably seasoned C&I loans 
that were not merger related.     
 III-A-8   
 
 
Household Lending 
Domestic respondents indicated that their willingness to make consumer installment loans was about unchanged in the October su rvey.  On net, standards and terms on 
credit card and non-credit-card consumer loans changed little over the past three months.  About 45 percent of domestic res pondents reported that they had experienced 
weaker demand for consumer loans, a somewh at larger net fraction than in the July 
survey.  Domestic banks reported that credit standard s on residential mortgage loans were little 
changed, on net, over the past three months .  Demand for residential mortgage loans 
weakened further in the October survey:  About 60 percent of domestic institutions—
roughly the same net fraction as in the July survey—noted that demand for such loans 
had weakened over the previous three months.

In August, the value of exports of goods  and services increased 2.3 percent after 
declining in July.  The increase was led by stronger exports of capital goods, with 
aircraft, computers, semiconductors, and othe r machinery all climbing briskly.  Exports 
of industrial supplies also exhibited str ong growth, while exports of consumer goods 
were boosted by a particularly large jump in  the volatile category of artwork and 
antiques.  Exports of automotive products  fell slightly, whereas services exports 
expanded modestly. 
 
The average value of exports in July and A ugust increased 8.5 percent (a.r.) from the 
second quarter.  Exports of automotive produc ts, consumer goods, and industrial supplies 
contributed significantly to the overall increase, whereas serv ices exports were flat.

IV-4 
The value of imported goods and services incr eased 2.4 percent in August.  A sharp rise 
in the value of imported oil and natural gas co ntributed importantly to the increase.  The 
increase was also supported by stronger impor ts across most other categories of goods.  
Imports of capital goods were boosted by robus t imports of computers, semiconductors, 
and telecommunications equipment, while a jump  in imports of metals pushed up imports  
of non-oil industrial supplies.  Imports of  foods, automotive products, and consumer 
goods also increased.  Imports of services fell back slightly in Augus t, largely on account 
of a decline in imports of travel services. 
 
The average value of imports in July and A ugust increased 15.6 percent (a.r.) from the 
second quarter.  A large increase in the value of imported oil contributed to the overall 
increase, but imports of non-o il industrial suppli es, capital goods, and consumer goods 
also exhibited large gains.  Imports of automotive products fell, and services imports 
were flat. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In September, import prices of non-oil goods and core goods rose 
0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively.  These increases primarily reflected a 0.9 percent rise in prices for material-intensive  goods.  Prices for non-fuel industrial supplies increased 
1.0 percent in September, as higher prices for metals were partly offset by falling prices for chemicals.  After increasing 2.5 percent in  August, food prices we re up 0.4 percent in 
September.  In contrast to material-inten sive goods, prices for imported finished goods 
edged up only 0.1 percent.  Prices for imported computers fell 0.5 perc ent, and prices for 
semiconductors edged down 0.1 percent.  
 
The average level of core import prices in th e third quarter was 4½ percent at an annual 
rate above the second-quarter average, as pri ces increased in all major sub-categories.  
Prices for material-intensive goods were up 9¼ percent (a.r.), whereas prices for finished 
goods increased 2¾ percent (a.r.).  
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil plummeted 10.3 percent in September.  The 
spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WT I) crude oil fell from an average of $73 per 
barrel in August to an average of  $64 per barrel in September.  Thus far in October, the 
spot price of WTI has fallen further, clos ing at $58.94 per barrel on October 17.  The 
sharp drop in the spot price appears to re flect an improved outlook for oil supply.

Two recent developments — the return of most  of the lost production at Alaska's Prudhoe 
Bay oil field and a lack of damaging storms this hurricane season — will likely allow for 
higher than expected U.S. production over the near term.  However, a continuing supply 
disruption in Nigeria and risk s to oil production in Iraq and Iran continue to support oil 
prices at historically elevated levels. 
 
Exports.   In September, prices of U.S. exports  of total goods and core goods fell 0.5 and 
0.6 percent, respectively.  Thes e were the first declines in these indexes since November 
2005.  The September decline was driven by a 1.8 percent fall in prices for nonagricultural industrial supplie s, reflecting lower prices for petroleum.  Chemical 
prices were also down in September, although metals prices were up.  Agricultural export 
prices fell 0.7 percent.  In contrast, export prices for finished goods increased 0.1 percent 
in September.  Prices of exported computers rose 0.7 percent, whereas prices for semiconductors fell 0.6 percent.   
 
The average level of core export prices in the third quarter was 6½ percent at an annual 
rate above the second-quarter average, as pri ces increased in all major sub-categories.  
Much of the increase can be attributed to the 12½ percent increase in the prices of material-intensive goods, as prices of both agricultural products and nonagricultural industrial supplies rose sharpl y in July and August.   
 
U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $874 b illion (a.r.) in the second quarter of 2006, 
about $21 billion wider than recorded in the first quarter of 2006 (revised).  The trade 
deficit widened $11 billion, as increased expor ts of goods and services were more than 
offset by increased imports.  A $4 billion net increase in outflows from unilateral 
transfers contributed to the wi dening of the deficit.   
 
The investment income balance was negative $1 0 billion (a.r.) in the second quarter, and 
the first-quarter investment income balance was revised down by $18 billion to negative $4 billion.  Although interest, di vidend, and direct investment income receipts increased 
in the second quarter, there were even larger  increases in interest , dividend, and direct 
investment payments.  As revised, the inve stment income balance was negative in the 
past three quarters, suggesti ng that the large negative ne t international investment 
position is finally beginning to add to the financing n eeds of the current account.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
The financial flows associated with the curr ent account are highlighted in bold in the 
Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.  Recorded net private financial inflows 
decreased slightly in the second quarter and, at $80 billion, were well below the levels 
recorded in the second half of 2005.  Measured  official financial inflows were little 
changed from the first quarter and total financ ial flows, official a nd private, were $154 
billion, or $17 billion less than  in the first quarter.  The d ecrease in recorded total net 
inflows, combined with a small increase in  the current account deficit to $218 billion, 
increased the size of the stat istical discrepancy to an unus ually large $65 billion for the 
quarter.  This positive sta tistical discrepancy indicates some combination of under-
recorded net financial inflows or over-reco rded net imports of goods and services and 
other transactions measured in the current account balance. 
 
The second-quarter reduction in net private financial inflows reflected in part a $46 
billion drop in foreign purchases of U.S. s ecurities (line 4).  Fore ign private investors 
continued to acquire agency and corporate secu rities at a substantial pace (lines 4b and 
4c) but showed little interest in Treasuries (l ine 4a) or equities (line 4d).  U.S. purchases 
of foreign securities (line 5) were litt le changed from the prior three quarters. 
 
IV-9 
Flows of foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) remained strong in the 
second quarter as reinvested earnings remain ed high.  Direct investment inflows from 
Europe were above their trend level and acc ounted for more than 75 percent of total 
inflows in the quarter.  U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6), af ter recording atypical 
inflows in the second half of last year as  foreign earnings were repatriated under the 
Homeland Investment Act, returned to their nor mal pattern of outflows in the first half of 
this year and were roughly equa l to the level of foreign dire ct investment into the United 
States during the second quarter.  Reinvested  earnings remained strong in the quarter, but 
outflows associated with new equity investment slowed from th eir first-quarter level.  As 
usual, the majority of U.S. direct invest ment went to Europe and Asia.  Foreign 
acquisition of U.S. currency (line 8) has been  unusually low in th e past two quarters, 
primarily because Russia, typically a major purchaser of U.S. currency, was a net seller 
during the first half of 2006.  In more recent monthly data, net foreign private purchases of U.S. securities rebounded 
sharply in August (line 4) after unusually m
odest  inflows in July.  While there were only 
small net purchases of U.S. equities (line 4d) during the month, foreign acquisitions of 
Treasury, agency, and corporate debt securities (lines 4a-c ) were all well above their 
recent norms.  Prior to the substantial net pu rchases in August, foreign private investors 
had reduced their holdings of Treasuries during the first seven months of the year.  U.S. 
acquisitions of foreign securities decreased sharply from recent levels during the month (line 5), with purchases of de bt securities (line 5a) only slightly exceeding net sales of 
equities (line 5b).  Through th e first eight months of th e year, both foreign private 
acquisitions of U.S. securities and U.S. acquisi tions of foreign securities have maintained 
paces similar to last year.  Foreign official inflows (line 1) continued at a high level in August and rem
 ain on a pace 
about midway between the record level of 2004 and last year’s much smaller total.

Foreign Financial Markets  
After moving little on balance during the second half of  September, the dollar’s 
weighted-average exchange value against other major currencies moved up in early 
October; on net, it rose about 1¼ percen t over the intermeeti ng period.  The dollar 
appreciated following speeches by Fed offici als that were interpreted by market 
participants as suggesting a lower likelihood of policy easing in early 2007, following the 
release of the September U.S. employment report, and following the release of the 
minutes of the September 20 FOMC meeting.  On  a bilateral basis, the dollar appreciated 
1½ percent against the euro and the yen, and slightly more th an 1 percent against sterling 
and the Canadian dollar.  After decreasi ng in late September, the options-implied 
volatility of the dollar-euro and yen-dollar exchange rates increased slightly in early 
October during the period of rapid dollar appreciation, but remains close to historically low levels. 
 
Headline equity indexes rose about 4½ percen t in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and 
Japan.  Market participants attributed the rise in share prices in these countries to falling 
oil prices and a scaling back of expectations of future pol icy tightening by several central 
banks.  Equity prices in Europe also rose following the release of a better-than-expected 
IFO German business climate survey on September 26.  Beginning on October 3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index eclipsed it s former closing record, set on January 14, 
2000, on several successive days.  Broader U. S., European, and U.K. stock market 
indexes, however, are still trading 10 to 20 percent below their early-2000 record highs.  The S&P500 and DJ Euro Stoxx indexes began to exceed their early-May year-to-date highs late in the intermeeting period, but the TOPIX still sta nds about 7 percent below its 
early-April high.  Realized vol atilities on headline equity indexes remained low during 
the intermeeting period.   
 
On October 5, the European Central Bank increa sed its policy rate 25 basis points, to 3.25 
percent, in a move that had been fully an ticipated.  The Bank of  England, the Bank of 
Japan, and the Bank of Canada all kept  their respective policy rates unchanged. 
Three-month spot interest rates were little changed in Japan, Canada, and increased 8 and 
16 basis points in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively.  Ten-year nominal and indexed sovereign yields are up about  10 basis points on balance in Japan and 
Canada, but are little changed in the Unite d Kingdom and Germany.  Long-term interest 
rates in most major developed countries fe ll substantially in la te September, with 
fluctuations in foreign yields generally track ing declines in dollar-b ased yields.  The drop 
in U.S. yields in late September was triggered by a much lower than expected 
IV-13 
Philadelphia Fed business activity index, wh ich reportedly raised concerns over a 
possible U.S. economic slowdown.  Nominal and real long-term interest rates in most 
major developed countries followed U.S. rates up again in early October, in response to 
speeches by Fed officials, the September employment report, and the release of the 
FOMC minutes.  Realized volat ility of ten-year government  bonds changed little in most 
industrial economies over the intermeeting period, and remains very low by recent 
historical standards. 
 
On September 19, Thailand’s military leaders staged a coup d’etat  and ousted the civilian 
government.  In the days that followed, the Th ailand headline equity index declined about 
2¾ percent, but the Thai baht depreciated only modestly.  Thai share prices have more 
than retraced and are now almost  2 percent higher  since the coup. 
 
Following news that North Korea carried ou t an underground nuclear  test on October 8, 
the Korean won depreciated 1½ percent agai nst the dollar, the Ko spi stock index fell 
almost 2½ percent, and the headline Si ngapore and Hong Kong stock market indexes 
each fell over 1 percent.  Subsequently, shar e prices in Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong 
reversed part or all of th ese losses.  Nevertheless, th e Kospi is down 0.9 percent on 
balance over the intermeeting pe riod.  Most other major equ ity indexes in emerging Asia 
have, in contrast, risen 3 to  6 percent on balance.   
 
The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value ag ainst the currencies of our other important 
trading partners declined ½ percent on balance over the in termeeting period.  The dollar 
depreciated 2 percent against the Brazilian real, over 1 percent against the Mexican peso, 
and also depreciated some against the currencies of several East-Asian emerging market economies.  The Brazilian Bovespa index and the Mexican Bolsa index rose over 9 and 
5 percent, respectively.  Brazilian financ ial indicators outperformed in part on 
expectations that President Lula will be for ced to moderate spending plans to prevail in a 
runoff vote on October 29 against Alckmi n, the opposition candidate.  The overall 
EMBI+ spread rose 22 basis points, to 218 basis points, between September 19 and 
September 25.  Market participants suggested that  this was in part due  to a general retreat 
from risk, reflecting both c oncerns over a potential U.S. economic slowdown and to 
concerns over current account imbalances and rising political te nsions in specific 
emerging market countries.  Following the firs t round of Brazil’s presidential elections, 
and as concerns over a potential U.S. slowdown moderated, the EMBI+ spread more than 
retraced the earlier increases, and on balan ce it is currently down about 10 basis points 
over the intermeeting period.   
IV-14 
 
On net, the renminbi appreciated ¼ per cen t against the dollar over the intermeeting 
period.  It reached a high against the dollar on September 28, around the time of 
Secretary Paulson’s visit to China, but it partially retraced this rise subsequently. 
 
  The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
According to incoming data, economic activ ity in the foreign industrial economies 
continued to expand at a rela tively solid pace in the third quarter.  Indicators of 
investment spending suggest that the Japane se economy accelerated from the very slow 
second-quarter expansion.  Euro-area industria l production and retail sales have exceeded 
expectations but lower exports probably sl owed GDP.  In the United Kingdom, business 
confidence improved while consumer sentimen t declined, suggesti ng that the pace of 
economic activity remained near trend.  Strong import data and a decline in housing starts 
point to moderate Canadian growth in the third quarter. 
 
The drop in oil prices brought down headlin e inflation in most advanced foreign 
economies.  In September, twelve-month infl ation declined to 1.7 percent and 2.4 percent 
in the euro area and the Unite d Kingdom, respectively.  In Japan, by contrast, a surge in 
food prices led headline inflation to climb to 0.9 percent in August.   As expected, the 
ECB raised its policy interest rate  ¼ percentage point on October 5. 
 
In Japan , household demand appears to have weakened in the third quarter.  Average 
real household spending and retail sales for July and August fell 2.2 percent and 
0.5 percent, respectively, from th eir levels in the second quarter  despite a sharp rise in the 
reported real incomes of working households .  Although private machinery orders and 
housing starts also fell on average over the same period, there are indications that 
investment spending remained solid.  Produc tion of capital goods rose 0.6 percent over 
July and August, and the Bank of Japan’s Se ptember Tankan survey revealed that firms 
expect to increase capital spending by 8.3 per cent in the current fis cal year, while large 
manufacturers reported plans to  increase investment by 16.9 per cent.  The external sector 
also appeared to positively contribute to growth  as the average level of real exports over 
July and August rose 3.4 percent above its leve l in the second quarter, while real imports 
fell 0.8 percent over the same period.

The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent in August as the economy added 
80 thousand jobs and the labor force incr eased by 150 thousand workers.  The job 
openings-to-applications ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to 
the number of officially registered job seekers)  fell slightly but remained at an elevated 
level.  The healthy state of the job market  was also reflected in the September Tankan 
survey, in which the number of firms re porting labor shortages increased across all 
corporate size categories and sectors.  Desp ite these improvements, gross earnings, which 
include bonuses, fell 0.3 percent in the y ear to August while contractual earnings 
declined 0.1 percent. 
 
The headline consumer price index rose 0.6 pe rcent in August and wa s 1 percent higher 
than a year earlier.  However, this increas e was almost entirely due to a jump in food 
prices.  Twelve-month core inflation (exc luding fresh food only) was 0.3 percent and 
consumer prices excluding both fresh food and en ergy fell 0.4 percent from  a year earlier.  
Year-over-year domestic wholesale goods in flation ticked up to 3.6 percent in August, 
and the wholesale service price index for August rose 0.3 percent from a year earlier, the 
first positive reading in eight years. 
 
Shinzo Abe was elected Japan's new pr ime minister on September 26, scoring 
comfortable majorities in both houses.  Abe appointed Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a former senior vice minister for foreign affairs, to the key pos t of chief cabinet secretary, and also picked 
Liberal Democratic Party veteran Koji Omi as finance minister and former Cabinet 
Office official Hiroko Ota as minister in char ge of economic and fiscal policy.  Minister 
Omi stated that the government will not begin a full-fledged debate on possible increases in the consumption tax until fall next year, vowing instead to focus on cutting government spending.  Although he is expected to concentrate on foreign policy issues in 
the near term, in his inaugural policy speech  to the lower house of Parliament Prime 
Minister Abe stressed his resolve to continue  the structural reform programs initiated by 
his predecessor, Junichiro Ko izumi, and pledged to draw  up a long-term strategy to 
promote technology, innovation, and economic growth.

Available indicators suggest that the euro-area  economy continued to expand at a robust 
pace in the third quarter, even if a less dynamic external sector likely led to some 
moderation in the growth rate of overall activity. 
 
In September, the European Commission survey  of euro-area economic  sentiment rose to 
its highest level in five and ha lf years, with increased confid ence in all sectors.  Industrial 
confidence bounced back from a dip the prev ious month, with production expectations 
rebounding sharply and the reported volume of or der books rising to within a hair of the 
previous business cycle peak in June  2000.  Consumer confidence was buoyed by 
improvement in consumers' perceptions of both the general economi c situation and their 
own financial situation.  Similarly, German y's IFO Business Climate Index edged down 
less than had been expected, to 104.9 in Se ptember from 105 in August.  The current 
conditions component of the index reached a fifteen-year peak, i ndicating a continuation 
of the robust economic activity in the current  quarter, but business expectations for the 
next six months declined for the third straight month. 
 
The domestic sector appears to be on relatively solid footing .  Euro-area industrial 
production rose 1.8 percent in August, more th an reversing the 0.5 percent fall posted in 
July.  In Germany, the volume of industrial  orders surged 3.7 percent in August, the 
fourth rise in five months and the biggest si nce April.  In addition, euro-area retail sales 
rose 0.7 percent in August, and average sales for July and August were up 0.9 percent from the second quarter. 
 
By contrast, the merchandise trade deficit in the euro area widened from a monthly 
average of about $2.1 billion in the second quarter to an average $7.4 billion over July and August.  After having surged in the first half of the year, exports were flat on average in the first two moths of the third quarter with respect to the second-quarter average, 
while imports grew 1.5 percent over the same period. 
 
Labor market conditions remain on a gradua l improving trend.  However, the euro-area 
unemployment rate ticked up to  7.9 percent in August, as the number of jobless in 
Germany rose, in part because of the end of the World Cup games.

In September, the headline index of consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent from the 
previous month, and twelve-month rate of  inflation dropped to 1.7 percent from 
2.3 percent in August, the first reading below 2 percen t since May 2005.  The sharp 
decline was mostly due to the combined result  of a favorable base effect, given the strong 
rise in energy prices in September 2005, as well as the recent drop in oil prices.  Core 
inflation (excluding energy and food prices) remained steady at 1.5 percent.  As expected, the ECB hiked its policy rate 25 basis points, to  3.25 percent, at its October 5 meeting.  In 
addition, the ECB signaled that it will tighten  again in December and used language that 
hinted at a pause thereafter. 
 
In the United Kingdom , most data point to a slow down of private consumption.  
Consumer confidence, which h it a three-year low in August, further deteriorated in 
September.  Surveys of businesses providi ng services to consum ers also showed a 
deterioration of optimism in the third quart er.  On a more positive note, retail sales 
expanded 0.3 percent in August af ter losing momentum in July. 
 
There are signs that the modera ting effects of this slower consumption growth have been 
partly offset by a mild resurgence in investment.  Business conf idence continued to 
improve in the third quarter.  In August, ne w construction orders re corded their second 
highest level since 1988.  Indus trial production stayed put in  August as the decline in 
mining and quarrying activities was offset by an overall good performance in the 
manufacturing sector.  According to the Bank of England Agent’s Survey, investment intentions ticked up in August in the manufacturing sector, indicating mild growth, while 
they remained strong in the service sector.  The service sector PMI ticked up to 56.7 in 
September while the manufacturing PMI firm ed to 54.4 (where 50 is threshold for 
expansion), offsetting most of its decline sin ce June.  Readings in house prices collected 
by Nationwide and Halifax, two leading Br itish lenders, both point to 8¼ percent 
increases in the year to September. 
 
The claimant count as well as the unemploy ment rate held steady at 3 percent in 
September and 5.5 percent in August, respectivel y.  A noticeable rise in the participation 
rate has imparted an upward drift to the Labor Force Survey measure of the 
unemployment rate since mid-2005, even as employment growth has been relatively solid.

The twelve-month inflation rate declined from  2.5 percent in Augus t to 2.4 percent in 
September, pushed down by a negative 0.4 perc entage point contribution from the fuels 
and lubricants component.  Mounting price pr essure remains a concern, however.  Core 
inflation (excluding energy and unprocesse d food) was up 0.3 percentage point to 
1.6 percent in September.  A survey conducte d by the British Chambers of Commerce in 
the third quarter found that 32 percent of manufactu ring firms and 28 percent of service 
firms expected to raise their prices.  Moreove r, British universities are allowed to charge 
up to £3,000 a year in tuition fees this academ ic year, up from the previous level of 
£1,175.  The Bank of England expects this measure, which applies only to incoming 
cohorts of students, to incr ease headline inflation ¼ per centage point in October. 
 
In Canada, real GDP by industry rose 2.3 percent (a.r.) in July, as in creased activity in 
the energy, retail trade, and wholesale trade se ctors more than offset a third consecutive 
monthly decline in output of the construction sector.  Strong automobile and automotive 
product sales were behind much of the advances  in wholesale and in retail trade.  By 
contrast, sales at home centers and hardware stores were down substantially, consistent 
with the decline in the construction sector; especially steep was the decline of 
construction of single-family ho mes.  Output of the manufact uring sector, which has been 
weak all year, was essentially unchanged from the previous month.  
 
Other indicators also suggest that growth remained somewhat subdued in the third quarter.  Housing starts slipped again in September, putti ng third-quarter housing starts 
three percent below their second-quarter level.  The volume of manufacturing shipments rose in August, but new and unfilled orde rs both declined.  Although the nominal 
merchandise trade balance expanded in August,  its average level in  July and August was 
about 6 percent below the second-quarter average, with nominal exports about 
2.5 percent higher than and nominal imports near ly 4 percent higher than their respective 
second-quarter averages.  By contrast, after declining for three straight months, the Ivey Purchasing Managers Index rose in Septembe r.  In addition, the composite index of 
leading indicators accelerated in September.  
 
In September, total employment edged up slig htly after three months  of little change.  
Full-time employment, which has seen strong growth all year, (eve n through the recent 
lull in top-line employment growth) fell a bit in September.  The unemployment rate 
inched down to 6.4 percent in September, but remained a bit higher than the 32-year-low 
of 6.1 percent touched in June.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price infl ation fell to 2 percent in August, the third 
consecutive month of decline.  The recent deceleration of prices  is in large part 
attributable to the retreat of gasoline prices .  The twelve-month rate of core inflation 
(excluding the eight most volatile components and the effects of indirect taxes) held 
steady at 2 percent in August. 
 
Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Across the emerging market economies, incoming  data generally poin t to moderating, but 
robust, growth in the third quarter.  Activity  appears to be decelerating in China and 
Korea, but rebounded in the ASEAN region, nota bly in Singapore, and remains strong in 
India.  In Latin America, indicators poin t to a moderation of growth in Mexico and 
Argentina, and to some pick up of activity in Brazil.  Infl ation has edged down in Asia 
but increased in Latin America of late.  Emerging market economies appear to be 
resilient to the recent deterioration of th e political environment in some countries. 
 
In China , economic activity appears to be decele rating, owing to recent administrative 
and other measures taken to slow investment.  Investment in fixed assets rose 20 percent 
over the twelve months ended August, down si gnificantly from the growth rates in the 
range of 26 to 33 percent seen in the prev ious few months.  However, the monthly 
investment series can be ve ry noisy.  The slowdown is al so reflected in decreasing 
twelve-month growth of imports of machinery and transport equipment, and in a modest 
deceleration of M2 money supply and bank le nding in August and September.  China’s 
trade surplus for the first nine  months of this year amounted to $160 billion (at an annual 
rate) compared with a surplus of $102 billion for all of last year, reflecting a growth rate 
of exports that was significantl y higher than that of imports.

In Taiwan , recent data suggest a moderation in  real GDP growth from its strong 
second-quarter pace.  The valu e of exports and imports fell in the third quarter after 
registering positive growth in the second.  Similarly, the growth rates of industrial 
production and export orders for electronic products have edged down in the third 
quarter.  Twelve-month inflation remained ne gative in September.  The recent bout of 
deflation has been largely attributed to d eclines in food prices (as weather conditions 
improved this year) and to lower energy prices.

The Korean  economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Industrial production 
partially rebounded in August after strikes a nd poor weather depressed July levels.  
Recent sentiment indicators are up a touch from  their earlier lows, but do not yet reflect 
the impact of North Korea’s nuclear test.  Although the merchandi se trade balance for 
August improved, the current account balance de clined further as the service deficit 
widened.  Consumer price inflation fell back to 2.4 percent over the 12 months ended 
September, reflecting a dip in food prices following an earlier weat her-related spike.

Indian  real GDP growth slowed to 7 percent in the second quarter from its blistering 
first-quarter pace.  Sizable gains in manuf acturing and services were tempered by 
weakness in construction and agriculture, and the trade balance and current account 
deteriorated significantly.  More recently, average indus trial production for July and 
August rose 1.4 percent above the second-quarter level, and the trade deficit has 
worsened so far in the thir d quarter.  Twelve-month inflation of the closely watched 
wholesale price index remained near 5 percent in the third quarter.  The high level of the 
central government’s fiscal  deficit through August sugge sts that, without a sharp 
improvement in September, the government will likely violate the mid-year targets set by 
the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Mana gement Act, thus requiring corrective 
measures and an explanatory statement to parliament.

Incoming data for the ASEAN  region suggest that economic activity expanded at a solid 
pace in the third quarter.  In Singapore, the advance unofficial estim ate of third-quarter 
real GDP growth (not shown) indicate that growth jumped to 6.0 percent, twice the pace 
in the second quarter, due in part to a rebound of activity in th e volatile biomedical 
sector.  Elsewhere in the region, industrial production was up recently and trade balances 
improved from second-quarter levels in  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the region continued to decline due in part to 
waning effects of earlier energy price increases, although previ ous tightening of monetary 
policy across the region also contributed.  Citi ng the moderation in inflation and the need 
to stimulate domestic demand, Bank Indonesia lowered interest rates 50 basis points on 
October 5, the fifth rate reduction since May.  Separately, Bank Indonesia announced on 
October 11 that it has repaid the remainde r of the country’s debt to the IMF (around 
$3.2 billion), nearly four years ahead of schedule, amid an improved balance of payments 
and a strengthening of economic fundamentals. 
 
In Thailand, Army Chief General Sonthi Boonyaratkalin led a milita ry coup that ousted 
Prime Minister Thaksin on September 19.  Si nce then, the Council for National Security 
(the group of army officers who staged the coup) has appointed retired General Surayud 
Chulanont as Prime Minister  to lead the new government; the central bank governor, 
Pridiyathorn Devakula, became Deputy Prime Mi nister and Finance Minister.  His deputy 
governor in charge of the financial institutio ns stability, Tarisa Watanagase, replaced him 
on October 17.  Following the appointment, she issued a statement indicating continuity 
in monetary policy going forward.  The government is expected to, among other things, administer the 2007 budget, help craft a new constitution, and prepare elections by 
October of next year.  Market reaction to th e coup has been benign, with little signs of 
spillover to other countries in  the region, and risks of a financial or economic crisis 
appear low.

Recent indicators for Mexico  point to a step-down in growth in the third quarter after two 
consecutive exceptionally strong quarters.  The index of overall economic activity (a 
monthly proxy for real GDP) rose only 0.2 pe rcent in July from the previous month.  
Industrial production was down in July and flat in August.  Twelve-month headline 
inflation was 4.1 percent in September, slightly above the target range of 2 to 4 percent.  
The higher-than-expected infla tion reading was the result of  some food prices increases, 
mainly for tomatoes.  On the political front, the radical opposition from the losing leftist 
party to the declaration of conservative Felipe Calderon as pr esident-elect appears to have 
abated.

Recent indicators for Brazil  have been mixed, but generally  point to a rebound in activity 
from a tepid second quarter.  Industrial pr oduction was up in July and August, and the 
trade balance improved considerably in the third quarter, but September vehicle sales 
disappointed.  Twelve-month consumer pri ce inflation was 3.7 percent in August and 
September, well below its 2005 level.  Inflati on is at its lowest level since inflation 
targeting was launched in 1999 aided, in recent months, by declines in prices of food and 
fuel ethanol.  In late September, the gove rnment removed a requirement that outward 
investments be intermediated by banks in Brazil, thereby easing controls on outward 
movement of capital by residents.

In the October 1 presidential election, President Lula fell short of achieving a simple 
majority, forcing him to go into a runoff against conservative  Geraldo Alckmin on 
October 29.  Lula is expected to win the electio n, but there are concerns that he will have 
difficulties pushing reform proposals through an uncooperative congress.

Indicators for Argentina  suggest that growth may moderate  a bit in the third quarter from 
the strong pace in the second.  Industrial production in July and August was just 
1.4 percent on average above its level in the previous quarter.  Twelve-month inflation 
remained elevated in August, but lower than la st year, due in part to the voluntary price 
agreements the government has secured in several sectors.

In Venezuela , available information suggests that economic activity has remained strong 
in the third quarter.  Auto sales in Septembe r were up 90 percent from a year earlier.  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies lifted twelve-month inflation to 15½ percent 
in September despite government measures to rein in inflation, including price controls 
on food.

In Turkey,  incoming data suggest a slowdown in activity from its st rong second-quarter 
pace.  Industrial production was down on averag e in recent months, and the trade and 
current account balance continued to deteriorat e.  Twelve-month consumer prices edged 
up to 10.5 percent in September, opening the possibility of additio nal interest rate 
increases.  Turkey remains on-track with its IMF program.

In South Africa , real GDP rose nearly 5 percent in the second quarter, due mostly to a 
rebound in government expenditures that more th an offset a contraction in the external 
sector.  More recently, average production was up from second-quarter levels, notably in 
the mining sector, but the trade balance continues to deteriorate due to excess growth of 
imports over exports.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation has been rising of late, 
reaching 5.1 percent in August.  The higher inflation owes to a weakening currency, 
rising food prices, and strong consumer spending, and has raised concern that it might exceed the central bank’s 3-6 pe rcent target range in coming months.  Citing the need to 
contain inflation, the South African Reserve Ba nk raised its key in terest rate 50 basis 
points to 8.5 percent on October 12.  
 
The current account has widened significantly in the first half of this year, mostly 
reflecting a deterioration of the trade balance, but also larg e dividend payments to foreign 
shareholders.  The wider current account defici t, among other factors, has put pressure on 
the currency, which has depreciated about 20 percent against the US dollar since January 
of this year.
