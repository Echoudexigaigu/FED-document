Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 On balance, the incoming data have left in tact our assessment that real activity is 
increasing at a subdued rate during the second half  of this year.  Residential construction 
declined further in October and continues to exert considerable restraint on overall real 
activity.  In contrast, consumer  spending and business fixed investment have increased at 
a moderate pace.  Meanwhile, production in  the industrial sector was held down by 
further reductions in motor vehicle output; ou tside of motor vehicles  and utilities, output 
edged up.  More broadly, employment gains have been reasonably well maintained in 
recent months, and the labor market has tightened further.  Additional sharp declines in 
energy prices pushed total consumer price in flation lower in Oct ober; core inflation, 
however, remained above its  year-earlier level. 
 Labor Market Developments  
The demand for labor has continued to increase at a moderate pace.  Although 
employment on private nonfarm payrolls ro se just 58,000 in October, upwardly revised 
estimates for previous months now show th at private employers added an average of 
135,000 jobs per month in the third quarter—s omewhat more than our estimate of the 
amount required to absorb the trend increase in the labor force.  In October, employment 
declined in goods-producing i ndustries, in which the ma nufacturing and construction 
industries posted sizable job losses.
1  In contrast, professi onal and nonbusiness services 
industries continued to add j obs at a brisk clip.  In a ddition, government employment 
jumped 34,000, primarily because of hiring in local education, which has been expanding 
robustly in recent months.  Despite the smaller gain in employment in October, an uptick 
in the average workweek boosted aggreg ate hours of production or nonsupervisory 
workers on private nonfarm payrolls 0.3 percent. 
 
The increases in the household survey measur e of employment have outpaced those from 
the payroll survey in recent months:  The unemployment rate fell from 4.7 percent in 
August to 4.4 percent in Oc tober—the lowest level sin ce May 2001.  Although the less-
volatile estimate from the establishment su rvey is our preferred measure of monthly 
employment change, the household survey’s meas ure of employment al so contains useful 
information for medium-term trends in employment, and the recent strength in this 
indicator highlights the possibi lity that labor demand might be stronger than what is 
suggested by the latest payroll data.  
                                                
 
1 About one-fourth of the decline in manufacturing employment was due to a strike at Goodyear.

Other indicators of slack are mixed regardi ng the extent to which the labor market has 
further tightened of late.  The share of the unemployed who have been out of work more 
than twenty-six weeks moved down in Octobe r, while the fraction of workers who have 
exhausted their full complement of unemploy ment insurance benefits—the exhaustion 
rate—has been little changed over the past few months.  In November, the fraction of 
firms reporting to the National Federation of Independent Business that they had a hard-
to-fill position moved down to 22 percent, its lowest level in  about a year.  Meanwhile, 
households responding to the Conference Board su rvey reported that job availability had 
deteriorated somewhat in November.  
 The signal from other labor market indicators has deteriorated a touch on balance.  The 
news on layoffs has been mixed.  The four-w eek moving average of initial claims for 
unemployment insurance moved up 10,000, to 317,000, over the period relevant for 
predicting unemployment growth for November .  For the week ending November 25, the 
four-week moving average of in itial claims rose further, to 325,000; however, we believe 
this figure was affected by difficulty in seas onally adjusting the ini tial claims data around 
the Thanksgiving holiday.  Even discounting pa rt of the rise in claims, we are taking 
some signal from the fact that claims have b een elevated for the past two weeks; on net, 
recent claims data are consistent with furt her moderate employment gains in November 
and December.  Layoff announcements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, moved down in October and remained  at a fairly low level in November; we 
believe this indicator captures downsizing that will be achieved through layoffs and 
attrition over the next six to twelve months. 
 
Forward-looking indicators remain favorab le on balance.  Hiring plans of small 
businesses moved up in November to their highest level in near ly two years.  The fourth-
quarter net hiring plans of participants in the Manpower survey edged down but remained 
in the narrow and relatively  high range observed since 2004.  The University of 
Michigan’s index of household expectations regarding futu re developments in labor 
demand strengthened last month and remains at the high end of the range that has 
prevailed since the start of the year.  The Conference Boar d measure of expected labor 
market conditions ticked down last month but  has moved little, on net, over the past few 
months.

The staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector was unchanged in the 
third quarter after a second-quarter increase of 1.2 per cent (annual rate).2  Over the past 
four quarters, output per hour increa sed 1.3 percent by our estimate—about 
1½ percentage points below the pace recorded  during the preceding four quarters.  
According to the Bureau of La bor Statistics, output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate 
sector rose 5.6 percen t in the third qu arter of 2006 and 3.8 percent over the four quarters 
ending in 2006:Q3, just a shade higher than the 3.6 percent pace posted over the previous 
four quarters.

 Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) advanced  at an annual rate of 4¼ pe rcent in the third quarter, a 
step-down from the pace seen in the first half  of the year.  Recent monthly changes—an 
increase of 0.2 percent in October after a sizable drop in September—have been 
influenced importantly by cutbacks in the motor vehicle sector and weather-related 
fluctuations in energy output.  The ava ilable weekly output data for November—
principally for motor vehicle assemblies, electricity generation, refining output, steel 
production, and lumber output—shoul d contribute little, on balan ce, to the change in IP.

Manufacturing production posted a second stra ight monthly decline of 0.2 percent in 
October, primarily because of continued cutbac ks in motor vehicle assemblies.  October’s 
decline pushed manufacturing capacity uti lization down 0.3 percentage point, to 
80.7 percent.  This level, how ever, is still nearly a per centage point above its 1972–2005 
average.  Excluding the sharp cut in mo tor vehicle assemblies and related parts 
production, manufacturing produc tion edged up 0.1 percent af ter decreasing 0.1 percent 
in September.  Outside of manufacturi ng, a weather-related rebound in electricity 
generation contributed nearly 0.4 percentage point to the increa se in total IP, while output 
in the mining sector posted a sizable gain as crude oil extraction in Alaska returned to full 
production after Prudhoe Ba y’s partial shutdown. 
 
The IP index for motor vehicles and parts dr opped 4 percent in October, as automakers 
again slashed light truck pr oduction in a continued effort to pare back elevated 
inventories.  Total motor vehicle assemblies were 10.5 million units at an annual rate in 
October, the lowest level of activity sin ce North American automobile production was 
halted by the United Auto Workers strike in July 1998.  Current assembly schedules call 
for total motor vehicle production to step up to a pace of 11 million units in November 
and to record a further increase in December.  November’s rise should contribute roughly 
0.2 percentage point to the rate of change of total IP in that month. 
 
IP in high-tech industries increased a solid  2¼ percent in October after having posted 
average monthly gains of 2¾ percent over th e preceding three months.  The ongoing rise 
in the production of semiconductors is being supported by the rollout of a new generation 
of dual-core microprocessors (MPUs) and by continued stockbu ilding at Intel in 
anticipation of demand for these new MPUs.  In addition, other manufacturers have 
raised the production of memory and graphics -processing chips that are recommended for 
use with Microsoft’s new opera ting system, Windows Vista. 
 
Computer production posted another moderate  increase in October, as solid business 
demand more than offset further softness in the consumer segment.  A recent Gartner forecast suggests that production for the consumer segment will remain tepid through the end of the year because consumers will likely defer purchases in anticipation of the release of Windows Vista.
3  Conversely, after several recent launchings of large-server 
products, output of business computers conti nued to exhibit solid gains in the third 
quarter.  Production of comm unications equipment, which softened during July and 
                                                 
3 The final version of Vista was recently released to manufacturers and to large organizations and 
businesses, but it will not be available to consumers until January 30, 2007. 
II-11 
August, increased more than 2 percent in both September and October, in part because of 
a pickup in capital expenditures by major tel ecommunications service providers (TSPs).  
Annual capital expenditure guidance by TSPs suggests equipment spending—and 
therefore production—will be muted during the remainder of 2006. 
 Outside of motor vehicles and parts, energy, and high technology, production among the 
major market groups was mixed in October af ter broad-based declines in September.  
Consumer-goods output was little changed for a third consecutive month, as declines in 
consumer durables, such as appliances a nd home-improvement products, offset a small 
gain in consumer nondurables.  Output of business equipment more than reversed its 
September decline and stood 12 pe rcent above its year -earlier level; it was boosted in part 
by robust gains in commercial aircraft produc tion.  Production of business supplies was 
unchanged in October, while the output of ma terials was restrained by a large decline in 
steel production.
4  The output of construction supplies edged up in October after having 
declined in the second and third quarters , as continued decreases in residential 
construction supplies were more than offset by a gain in supplies more closely associated 
with nonresidential construction.    Near-term indicators of manufact uring activity suggest little ga in in output in the next 
few months.  The Institute for Supply Mana gement’s diffusion index for new orders 
dipped below 50 in November for the first time since April 2003, a sign of little change in 
near-term manufacturing produc tion, while the corresponding indexes from the Empire 
State and Philadelphia Business Outlook survey s moved in opposite directions to each 
other.  The three-month moving average of th e staff’s measure of real adjusted durable 
goods orders slid in October but was little changed, on balance, over the preceding five 
months. 
 
Light Motor Vehicles   
Sales of light vehicles averaged a modest a nnual rate of 16 million units in the first two 
months of the fourth quarter, a half-milli on units below their third-quarter pace.  
Concurrently with the recent de cline in gasoline prices, sa les of large and luxury sport-
utility vehicles and pickup trucks have s hown renewed signs of life in the past two 
months.  This development may help stem th e erosion of market share for the Big Three 
firms, whose sales are heavily sk ewed toward these types of vehi cles.  In line with a shift  
                                                
 
4 Industry contacts suggest that steel output will be a drag on materials production through the end of 
the year, as producers have sharply cut production in response to record levels of imports and to lower 
demand from automakers, appliance manufacturers, and residential builders.

toward larger vehicles, the six-month movi ng average of mean fuel economy for new 
vehicles sold ticked down in November af ter having moved up noticeably over the past 
two years.     
 
Recent gains in employment and income suggest that vehicle demand will be fairly well maintained in the near term.  Survey data , by contrast, give mixed indications about 
whether consumers’ buying perceptions have im proved from their recent lows:  Although 
the Michigan SRC index of car-buying attit udes moved up in November to its highest 
level in more than a year (in part becaus e concerns about fuel prices eased), the 
percentage of Conference Board survey respondents who plan to buy a new vehicle 
dropped sharply in November. 
 Light vehicle production has been  quite weak in the second half  of this year as the Big 
Three automakers have worked to address th eir inventory overhangs.  Assemblies of light 
motor vehicles dropped to a sluggish annual ra te of 10.5 million units in the third quarter; 
the latest schedules indicate that they will rema in near this pace in the fourth quarter and 
then edge up in the first quarter to 10.7 million units.  
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) cu rrently estimates that gross new motor 
vehicle output increased at an annual rate of 28 percent in the third quarter, a figure that 
stands in sharp contrast to the drop of 20 percent at an a nnual rate in the IP index for 
motor vehicles (excluding parts production) in the same period.  Much of the difference 
can be traced to the BEA’s method of inferri ng motor vehicle output from separate data 
on sales, net international trad e, and inventory changes rather  than measuring it directly 
using data on production.  On a quarterly ba sis, the unit flows imp lied by the direct and 
indirect measures can differ markedly:  In the first half of 2006, the indirect measure 
understated the level of production by about 150, 000 units; in the second half of the year, 
we estimate that the indirect measure w ill overstate production by about 250,000 units.  
In addition, an exceptionally large (and likely anomalous) drop in the PPI for light trucks 
in the third quarter resulted in a jump in th e BEA’s implied unit values of light trucks in 
inventory.  On balance, we be lieve that measurement issues caused the BEA to overstate 
the rate of increase in real gross domes tic output in the th ird quarter by about 
1 percentage point.  Looking ahead, we expect that the gradual unraveling of these issues 
will cause the BEA to understate GDP growth over the next two quarters but to a much 
lesser extent.

 Consumer Spending  
According to the latest data, real PCE rose a strong 0.4 percent in Oc tober after a smaller 
gain in September.  Although personal outlays  for motor vehicles softened in October, 
spending for nondurable goods such as gaso line, food, and apparel rose briskly.  
Expenditures for electricity services also jumped as temperatures swung from 
unseasonably warm to unseasonably cool.  After having edged down over the summer, 
the six-month change in real PCE excluding motor vehicles recently moved back up to a 
pace more in line with its average over the past few years.    Anecdotal evidence and weekly data on chain store sales suggest that the holiday 
shopping season got off to a good start; that  said, sales reports around previous 
Thanksgiving holidays have not proven to be a particularly reliable barometer of overall 
holiday spending.  Moreover, sales for November  as a whole were reportedly soft.  Still, 
consumer sentiment has moved up after ebbing late last summer, and November’s readings were at a level consiste nt with solid gains in spending.

Consumer spending has continued to draw support from the lagged effects of higher 
household wealth over the past two years.  Indeed, although house prices decelerated 
further in the third quarter, robust gains in the stock mark et maintained the ratio of 
household wealth to disposable  income at a level well above  its historical average.  
Although both short- and long-term loan rates have moved down recently, borrowing 
costs remain above year-ago levels. 
 
Housing   
Despite tentative signs that home sales ma y be stabilizing, resi dential construction 
remains very weak.  Single-family starts dr opped 16 percent in October to an annual rate 
of 1.18 million units, down 35 percent from their peak last January.  In addition, adjusted 
permit-issuance in this sector, which tends to be a more reliable indicator of the underlying pace of homebuilding than starts, fe ll to an annual rate of 1.20 million units in 
October, down 32 percent from a year earlier and close to its lowest level in the past 
ten years.  Starts in the much smaller multif amily sector remained within the range that 
has prevailed over the past decade, though adju sted permit-issuance in the sector—which 
is linked much more loosely to starts than is the case in the single-family sector—has 
moved down considerably of late.  
Following a sharp fall since their peak in th e summer of 2005, sales of new and existing 
homes have recently shown tentative signs of le veling off.  Sales of existing single-family 
homes in October were at an annual rate of 5.5 million units and have tracked a fairly flat 
trajectory since July.  New home sales, which have been subject to considerable revisions 
in recent months, came in at an annual rate  of 1.0 million units in October, in line with 
the average pace seen during the third quart er.  Moreover, the index of pending home 
sales—an indicator of future  sales of existing homes—has improved, on balance, since  
                                                
 
5 After incorporating unemployment insurance data from the second quarter, the BEA revised down the 
level of wages and salaries $100 billion beginning in that quarter.  Although we had expected a large 
downward revision, the magnitude was much larger than expected.  On net, the October level of wages and 
salaries is about $60 billion lower than we had expected in the October Greenbook.

July, while the index of homebuying sentiment from the Michigan survey has moved up 
in each of the past two months to its highest  level in more than a year.  These improving 
conditions seem to be, at least in part, the result of a decline in mortgage rates:  The 
average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mort gages has fallen 50 ba sis points since July, 
while average rates for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages are down about 30 basis 
points.  Even if sales do stabilize, homebuilders ma y hold the line on production to eliminate the 
substantial overhang of new homes for sale th at has accumulated over the past few years.  
The dramatic cuts to construction so far this  year have caused the level of the stock of 
new homes for sale to turn down a bit in re cent months, a departure from the pronounced 
upward trend in inventories th at began in early 2001.  De spite this encouraging sign, 
inventories remained quite elevated in Oct ober:  The months’ s upply of new homes for 
sale was still 45 percent above the upper bound of  the relatively narrow (and historically 
low) range it occupied from 1997 to 2005.  Mo reover, these published figures probably 
understate the true inventory pos ition of this sector because they do not account for the 
effect of sales cancellations on the stock of unsold homes.  
 
 House-price appreciation has slowed marked ly in recent quarters after quickening for 
much of the preceding decade; some price measures show outright declines.  The 
purchase-only version of the price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of 
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFH EO) moved up at an annual rate of just 
1½ percent in the third quarter, the smallest one-quarter increa se in the index since 1994.   
The Case-Shiller home-price index, which us es a methodology similar to that of the 
OFHEO index but is limited to sales in ten large U.S. cities, has also decelerated 
markedly over the past year.
 6  More recently, the average price of existing homes sold—
which is available on a timelier basis than these measures—posted an outright decline 
over the twelve months ending in October.  However, this measure does not adjust for 
changes in the characteristics of homes sold, so the decline might reflect a shift in the 
composition of sales away from higher-end homes .  Monthly readings of new-home price  
                                                 
6 The cities covered by the Case-Shiller index are Bo ston, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, 
Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and Wa shington.  Unlike the OFHEO index, which captures 
only sales backed by a conforming mortgage loan, the Case-Shiller measure captures all arms-length sales 
in the ten areas.

appreciation have fluctuated w ildly of late, in part becaus e of changes in the geographic 
composition and average quality of homes sol d.  However, on a constant-quality basis, 
new home prices (seasonally adjusted) were es sentially flat in the third quarter.  In 
reality, prices might be softer than indicated  by this index because it does not capture the 
fact that homebuilders have increased thei r use of incentives—such as granting more 
favorable mortgage terms, paying closing co sts, and including optional upgrades at no 
cost—to bolster sales and unload inventory. 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real equipment and software spending expande d a solid 7.2 percent (a nnual rate) in the 
third quarter.  However, incoming data suggest  some deceleration is under way:  Sales of 
light vehicles stepped down some in the firs t two months of the f ourth quarter, and both 
orders and shipments of nondefense capital  goods fell in October.  Among the key 
determinants of equipment spending, the user cost of capital and co rporate cash positions 
are supportive of further increases in n ear-term outlays, while business output has 
decelerated of late.  Moreover, some survey s, including those by the Institute for Supply 
Management and the Philadelphia Fed, have shown a considerable weakening of business 
conditions. 
 Business outlays on transportation equipment in creased at an annual rate of 11.2 percent 
in the third quarter, as motor vehicle outlays bo unced back after a seco nd-quarter decline.  
More recently, fleet sales of light vehicl es edged down in October and November, 
although the average sales rate was still st rong by historical standards.  In the 
commercial-truck sector, sales of medium and he avy trucks (classes 4 to  8) rose to a near-
record pace of 560,000 units (annual rate) in Octo ber.  Sales of medium and heavy trucks 
should remain brisk through the end of the year as firms rush to obtain vehicles ahead of 
the implementation of the upcoming 2007 EPA regulations on truck engines; however, 
this pull-forward of demand likely implies a si gnificant drop in truck sales early next 
year.  Indeed, with no available build slot s left in 2006, new orders for medium and 
heavy trucks plummeted in October to their lowe st level in three years.  Elsewhere in the 
transportation category, Boeing re ports that October deliveries  of aircraft were above 
their third-quarter average—a good start to the qu arter after declines in  outlays in each of 
the preceding two quarters. 
 High-tech spending rose at an annual rate of  10 percent in the thir d quarter, but incoming 
spending indicators point to some weakening si nce then.  After rising briskly in the third 
quarter, nominal orders and shipments of co mputers plunged 25 percent in October (not

at an annual rate).  These outsized declines are likely to prove tran sitory because they 
seem at odds with the continued moderate gains in our IP measures of computer 
production and the generally upbeat anecdotes  in this sector.  Real spending on 
communications equipment expanded at an annual  rate of 11 percent in the third quarter 
after a surge in the first half of the year.  However, nominal shipments of 
communications equipment decreased 2.3 percent in October (not at an annual rate), and 
orders dropped.  On the basis of their cap ital expenditures guid ance for 2006—and given 
their equipment purchases so far this year —telecommunications serv ice providers, which 
account for about one-fourth of total spending in this category, are likely to damp fourth-
quarter growth. 
 Real spending on equipment other than high-te ch and transportation remained on a solid 
upward trajectory in the thir d quarter despite a considerab le step-down from the brisk 
increases in the first half of the year.  In October, nominal shipments rose 1.3 percent (not 
at an annual rate), and gains were widespr ead across categories.  Orders slipped in 
October, but they continued to outpace sh ipments by a wide margin and point to 
continued gains in spen ding in the near term. 
 
Nonresidential Construction  
Activity in the nonresidential construction sector  has shown signs of moderating in recent 
months on the heels of the substantial and br oad-based increases seen for much of this 
year.  The three-month moving average of the architectural billings index—which is well 
correlated with growth in spending on nonres idential construction about six months into 
the future—moved down sharply in the spring of  this year, foreshadowing some of this 
recent slowing.  A more subdued pace of growth  in this sector would be in line with 
market conditions, which continue to show only modest improvements: Vacancy rates in 
the office and industrial categories have edge d down over the past few years but remain 
quite high, while the vacancy rate  in the retail sector has be en essentially flat at a low 
level for some time now.  Although the ar chitectural billings index has rebounded some 
recently, it remains well off the highs seen in late 2005.
7  This indicator, combined with 
the slower rate of growth in nonresidentia l construction employment seen in recent 
months, points to more-restrained spe nding gains in the coming quarters.  
 
In the drilling and mining sector , spending rose at an annual ra te of 10 percent in the third 
quarter—down from the nearly 30 percent increa se in the second quarter.  The number of  
                                                 
7 About 88 percent of the construction projects covered by the architectural billings index are 
nonresidential.

      1. Financial transactions consist of deposit insurance, spectrum auctions, and sales of major assets.      2. A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, orwhen the first 3 days of a month are nonworking days.  Outlays for defense, Social Security,Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.  In addition,defense outlays for retiree health care have been converted from an annual to a monthly basis. For August2006, receipts and outlays have been adjusted to reflect a one-time accounting correction by the Treasurythat reduced both individual income taxes and Social Security benefits by $6 billion.

rigs in operation has moved down, on balance, since September in response to the recent 
moderation in projected energy prices, and anecd otes point to concer ns about the rising 
costs of drilling activity.  Taken together, th is evidence points to a more subdued pace of 
spending growth in the months ahead. 
 
Business Inventories   
We estimate that, excluding motor vehicles, real nonfarm inventory investment edged up 
in the third quarter to an annual rate of $56 billion; as a consequence, these inventories 
made only a small positive contribution to the change in real GDP in the third quarter.  
More recently, October book-value inventory investment in manufacturing—the only 
piece of fourth-quarter inventory data that  we have at this point—stepped down to 
$21 billion. 
 
September saw an increase in the book-valu e inventory-sales ratio s for a number of 
industries; indeed, the overall inventory-sale s ratio for the manufacturing and trade sector 
(excluding motor vehicles) moved up to a leve l last seen in the middle of 2005.  Whether 
this increase is a signal of widespread i nventory imbalances is unclear, however.  The 
ISM customers’ inventory index also has moved up, on net, in recent months, though 
almost three-fourths of respondents indicated th at their customers’ inventory levels are in 
a comfortable range.  In addition, informati on from the staff’s fl ow-of-goods inventory 
system suggests that—excluding motor vehicles  and parts—months’ supply continued to 
move lower in October; except for paper, in ventories remain well aligned with demand.  
Other data indicate that the inventory-sales ratio at Intel is elevated—most likely in 
anticipation of strong prospect ive sales—while the inventory-shipments ratio at steel 
service centers has risen rapidly in recent m onths and probably reflects an unanticipated 
accumulation of stocks. 
 
Federal Government Sector   
The unified federal budget deficit improved in October.  According to the Monthly 
Treasury Statement, the adjusted deficit—wh ich controls for paym ent-timing shifts and 
financial transactions—was $6 billion smaller in that month than it was in the year-earlier 
period.  Over the twelve mont hs ending in October, the adjusted deficit was $251 billion, 
or about 2 percent of nominal GDP.  The adju sted primary deficit—e qual to the adjusted 
deficit less net interest outlays —declined to just $23 billion over the same twelve-month

period.8  In contrast to the near-term improve ment in the federal deficit, long-term 
projections of the federal budget—such as those by the Congressional Budget Office—
suggest an eventual erosion in the defic it and a rising debt-to-GDP ratio as the baby-
boom generation retires and pr ojected per-beneficiary heal th-care costs continue to 
increase faster than incomes. 
 
Tax receipts continued to outpace increases  in both federal spending and nominal 
incomes.  Receipts in October were more than  12 percent above thei r year-earlier level; 
individual income and payroll tax revenue, wh ich accounted for most of the receipts in 
October, were 11 percent greater than those of a year earlier.  Corporate tax receipts from 
the small number of firms that make payments in October were more than 25 percent above their year-earlier level.    
Federal outlays, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, increased 
almost 6 percent in October relative to the year-earlier period.  Net interest outlays 
increased 7 percent over that time period, reflec ting higher interest rate s and greater debt.  
Non-interest outlays in October rose 5½ per cent above their year- earlier level, mainly 
because of sizable increases in Medicare a nd defense spending.  In contrast, spending by 
FEMA for disaster relief and flood insuran ce—included in the “oth er outlays” category—
was more than $2 billion lower in Oc tober than it was a year earlier. 
 In the NIPAs, total real federal purchases incr eased at an annual rate  of 1½ percent in the 
third quarter, as real defense spending  edged down but real nondefense purchases 
rebounded.   
 Legislative activity has been negligible recently because th e Congress has mostly been 
out of session; as a result, much unfinishe d budget business for fis cal year 2007 probably 
will have to be taken up next year by the ne w Congress.  So far, only two of the twelve 
regular appropriations bills—those for defe nse and homeland security—have been passed 
for fiscal 2007.  The Congress did pass anot her continuing resolution to provide funding 
through December 8 for the other progra ms usually covered under the annual 
appropriations process, and an additional continuing resolution is expected to be enacted 
to go through mid-February. 
 
                                                
 
8 A primary deficit close to zero is a condition suggesting a relatively stable ratio of federal debt to 
nominal GDP.  (If the primary deficit is equal to zero, and the average nominal interest rate on federal debt 
is equal to the growth rate in nominal GDP, then the debt-to-GDP ratio remains constant.)

State and Local Government Sector  
We estimate that real purchases by state a nd local governments increased at an annual 
rate of about 2½ percent in the third quarter, a step-dow n from the robust 4 percent 
second-quarter pace but still significantly a bove the average pace recorded over the past 
few years.  After an explosive increase in  the second quarter, real  construction spending 
fell a bit in the third quarter, but employme nt rose a robust 33,000 per month on average, 
well above the average monthly pace seen durin g the previous few years.  In October, 
real construction spending appear s to have been about equal to  its third-quarter average, 
while employment continued to increase shar ply.  In the November elections, proposed 
constitutional amendments that would have imposed tight controls on state spending and 
taxes were defeated in the three states in  which they appeared on the ballot: Nebraska, 
Oregon, and Maine.  
 
Prices  
PCE prices moved down 0.3 percent in Sept ember and 0.2 percent in October; the 
decreases were led by sharp declines in energy prices in both months.  Over the twelve 
months ending in October, PCE prices rose just 1.5 percent, down fr om a 3.5 percent rate 
of increase over the preceding twelve-month period; this step-dow n also reflected the 
large swings in energy prices.  In contrast , core PCE prices rose 2.4 percent over the 
twelve months ending in October, up from th e 2.1 percent of a year earlier.  The pickup 
in core PCE prices over the past year larg ely reflects a marked acceleration in shelter 
costs.  More-recent core inflation readings remain be low the elevated levels reached earlier this 
year, although the extent of that slowing di ffers considerably between core PCE prices 
and the core CPI.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in October for 
the second month in a row, thereby bringing th e three-month change to an annual rate of 
2.7 percent, down only slightly from its peak rate of 2.9 pe rcent in May.  The slightly 
tamer recent readings reflect a notable decelera tion over the past few months in the prices 
for core goods and for shelter, which has been  partially offset by an acceleration in the 
prices of medical services (including the nonmarket component  of these prices) and a

variety of other services.  By contrast, th e three-month change in the core CPI was 
2.3 percent (annual rate) in October, down fr om its peak rate of 3.8 percent in May. 9  
 
The PCE price index for food and beverages also  rose 0.2 percent in Oc tober, in line with 
the average monthly gains over the summer.  The USDA has marked down its estimate of 
this year’s corn crop, which has resulted in rising spot prices for corn as well as for 
soybeans (on the anticipation that higher corn  prices will result in reduced planting of 
soybeans next season in favor of corn).  However, the small share of these commodities 
in total value of food pr oduction limits their effect  on overall food prices. 
 PCE energy prices fell 7.3 percen t in October after a similar-si zed decline in September.  
Gasoline prices tumbled 13 percent in Septem ber and 11 percent in October as both crude 
oil prices and margins moved lo wer.  Survey data through th e end of the month point to 
another—albeit smaller—declin e in November.  The index for natural gas fell back 
7.7 percent in October as earlier sharp declin es in spot prices were passed through to 
consumer prices.  Recently, natural gas inventories, which had been elevated as a result 
of precautionary stockbuilding during hurrica ne season, moved back to a more typical 
seasonal level, prompting a rebound in spot prices.  The four-quarter change in the GDP price index was 2.9 percent in the third quarter, 
down slightly from the year-earlier pace.  Excluding food and energy, the increase in 
GDP prices was also 2.9 percent, unchange d from a year earlier.  Although core PCE 
prices rose more rapidly over this period, other prices, especi ally the index for residential 
investment, decelerated.  
The sustained fall in gasoline prices in recent  months has likely contributed to a decline 
in inflation expectations.  Th e Michigan Survey Research Center reported that median 
one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell to  3.0 percent in November, down from its 
recent peak of 3.8 percent in August.  Median five- to ten-year-ahead  expectations also  
                                                
 
9 The CPI’s more-pronoun ced deceleration than the PCE price measure stems from several sources.  
First, PCE medical services prices  (which receive a relatively larger  weight) have accelerated far more 
rapidly than the corresponding CPIs for medical serv ices; this difference reflects the PCE index’s use of 
alternative price indicators for the market and nonmar ket portions of medical se rvices.  Second, shelter 
prices receive a greater weight in th e CPI, implying that their deceleration has acted as a larger drag on this 
index.  Third, the recent deceleratio n in core goods prices has been gr eater for the CPI because of both 
weighting and scope differences.

Expected Inflation  
In the September Greenbook, we introduced a new exhibit showing three types of 
measures of expected inflation.  To recap, th e top two panels show the median responses 
to two familiar questions from the Michigan Survey Research Center : one about inflation 
twelve months ahead and one about inflation five to ten years ahea d.  The questions are 
asked of approximately 500 households per mont h and do not refer to any particular price 
index.  (Specifically, the ques tions ask, “By about what per cent [per year] do you expect 
prices to go up/down, on the averag e, during the next twelve m onths [five to ten years]?”) 
 
The middle panels show two series that are important inputs into our inflation models:  
the FRB/US long-run expectations measures for CPI inflation and a distributed lag of 
core CPI inflation.  The FRB/US variable is constructed by splicing together three 
different series: for 1991 forward, the median  projection for CPI inflation over the next 
ten years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia; for 1981 through 1991, a related survey conducted by Richard 
Hoey, of Drexel Burnham Lambert; a nd for years preceding 1981, a model-based 
estimate constructed by the Board staff.  The distributed-lag measure is derived from one 
of the staff’s reduced-form Phillips curve models of core CPI inflation; multiplying the 
lagged inflation terms by the estimated coeffi cients on those terms (which are constrained 
to sum to one) generates the measure shown.  This distributed lag, although not a direct 
measure of expected inflation, is highly correlated with actual inflation and likely 
includes an important expectations component. 
 
Finally, in the bottom pair of panels, we show two series for inflation compensation 
derived from a comparison of yields on nomi nal Treasury securities  with yields from 
Treasury inflation-protected secu rities (TIPS).  These series, one for the next five years 
and one for five to ten years ahead, provide  a market-derived measure of expected 
inflation, albeit one that also  includes premiums for liquid ity and for inflation risk.  
Beginning with March 2004, the series on inflat ion compensation over the next five years 
is adjusted for the indexation-lag effect. 
 
Turning to prices at earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core 
intermediate materials rose 6 percent ove r the twelve months ending in October, 
compared with a 4¾ percent increase in the pr eceding year.  However, most of this step-

up occurred earlier in the year; more r ecently, prices have flattened out.  Core 
intermediate material prices held steady in October after ha ving risen only 0.1 percent in 
September.  The recent subdued readings lik ely reflect some pass-through of falling 
energy costs; the indexes of several energy- intensive goods and serv ices, particularly 
those that react more quickly to energy costs,  rose less rapidly, or even declined outright, 
in October. 
  Producer prices in other categor ies also declined in October.   The index for prices of 
capital equipment turned down 0.9 percent; this dec line primarily reflected a drop in the 
PPI for light trucks.  Typically, on a not-sea sonally-adjusted basi s, prices of motor 
vehicles increase in October as  new models are brought into th e index; however, prices of 
light trucks declined.
10  Prices for core crude materials fell 1.3 percent as metals prices 
dipped.   
 
Other price indexes for materials at earlier stages of production have moved up recently.  
The Commodity Research Bureau spot inde x of industrial materials is up 6¼ percent 
since the October Greenbook, while the Journal of Commerce  (JOC) index of industrial 
materials has risen 3 percent during the same  period.  Both indexes have been pushed up 
because of across-the-board increases in meta ls prices; the JOC index has risen by less 
because it also includes petroleum pr oducts, whose prices have decreased. 
 
Labor Costs 
As has been the case for some time, the comp ensation data do not give a particularly 
clear reading of the magnitude  of labor-cost inflation.  As measured by the employment 
cost index, hourly compensation of private i ndustry workers rose at an annual rate of 
3.6 percent over the three months ending in Se ptember; this pace was higher than that 
posted over the preceding several quarters and left the twelve -month change in the ECI at 
3 percent.  Although the recent pickup in the EC I is consistent with a tight labor market 
and continued pass-through of the high headline inflation of the pa st few years, its rate of 
increase over the past year remains be low that of other labor-cost measures. 
 
                                                 
10 This price decline appears to reflect a sampling anomaly in the PPI.  For the 2007 model year, 
General Motors significantly redesigned two popular pickup truck models that together account for more 
than 10 percent of domestic light truck production.  GM is continuing to produce the original versions of 
these trucks as well but has heavily discounted their prices to reflect the availability of the improved 
models.  The BLS appears to have included the original versions of these trucks—not the redesigned 
ones—in their sample, thereby capturing the large price declines for the original models in the PPI.

Consistent with the Productivity and Costs release, the staff estimates that compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector increase d at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the 
third quarter.  In addition, the BEA’s inco rporation of the state unemployment insurance 
data into the second-quarter compensation figures caused th e second-quarter change in 
hourly compensation to be revised down nearly  8 percentage points ; the measure is now 
estimated to have declined at an annual rate of 1.2 percent.  This lo wer rate suggests that 
the transitory factors that boosted first-qua rter hourly compensation—namely, a surge in 
stock option exercises and bonus payments —have largely gone away.  Smoothing 
through these swings puts the four-quarter ch ange in hourly compensation at 4.3 percent 
in the third quarter.  More  recently, average hourly earn ings moved up 0.4 percent in 
October, roughly in line w ith recent months; this incr ease brought the twelve-month 
change to 3¾ percent. 
 
According to the ECI, employer contributions for health insurance rose about 5 percent 
over the twelve months ending in Septem ber—1¾ percentage points less than the 
increase over the previous year.  Taken t ogether, the available indicators provide no 
evidence that any dramatic change in the rate of increase in health insurance costs is in 
the offing.  Private surveys suggest that prem iums will rise in the neighborhood of 6 to 
8 percent in 2007, about the same as the surv ey results for 2006.  Among the major plans 
for public employees, premiums in the Federa l Employees Health Benefits Program are 
expected to rise less than 2 percent, on aver age, in 2007 after an increase of 6½ percent in 
2006, while premiums for the Cali fornia Public Employees’ Retirement System are slated 
to move up 12 percent, on average, in 2007 after an increase of 9 percent in 2006.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Investors continued to anticipate that the FOMC will maintain the current stance of 
policy at its December meeting, but the anti cipated trajectory of policy beyond early 2007 
shifted down substantially over the interm eeting period amid some indicators of 
economic activity that were weaker than ma rket participants had been expecting.  
Nominal Treasury yields also dropped consid erably, with real yields moving lower and 
inflation compensation little cha nged.  Equity prices rose mo derately on the strength of 
favorable earnings news and lower interest  rates.  Risk spreads on corporate bonds 
remained at low levels, as corporate credit  quality continued to be solid.  Household 
borrowing stepped down in the third quarter, a nd indicators of credit quality remained 
favorable on the whole.  Profits of commerc ial banks edged lower in the third quarter 
from a high level, and loan pe rformance was generally solid. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The Committee’s decision at its October mee ting to leave the target federal funds rate 
unchanged and to make only modest changes to the accompanying policy statement was 
largely anticipated by market participants and elicited little reaction.  Similarly, the 
minutes of the meeting left little imprint on fi nancial markets.  Current quotes on federal 
funds futures contracts indicat e that investors continue to expect the Committee to 
maintain the current target at its Decemb er meeting.  However,  investors reportedly 
perceived a weakening in the expansion, res ponding partly to incoming data on spending, 
and consequently both moved up the timing and increased the amount of policy easing 
that they had previously antic ipated.  Options prices indicat e that investors now see about 
a 30 percent chance of a 25 basis point eas ing at the January meeting, and, over the 
intermeeting period, the expected path for policy further ahead shifted substantially 
lower.  Assuming our typical adjustment fo r term premiums, futures quotes imply that 
investors now expect 100 basis points of easing by mid-2008, considerably more than 
was expected at the time of the last FOMC  meeting.  A survey conducted by the Trading 
Desk indicates that primary de alers anticipate policy easing ne xt year as well, albeit less 
than that currently embedded in futures rates. 
 Over the intermeeting period, the distribution of  the target federal funds rate about six 
months ahead derived from options on Eu rodollar futures became somewhat more 
skewed to the downside.  Measures of uncertain ty about the future pa th of policy rose to 
their highest levels in more than a year.

III-3 
Two- and ten-year Treasury yields declin ed about 40 basis poin ts, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  Market commentary s uggested that the declines were driven 
importantly by perceptions of a softening of the economic outlook.  According to the 
staff’s three-factor model, as well as other measures, a substantial portion of the drop in 
rates over the intermeeting period was accounted for by a d ecline in term premiums.  
Amid moderately higher oil prices and benign readings on consumer price inflation, near-
term measures of inflation compensation base d on Treasury inflation- protected securities 
were little changed—after adjusting for ca rry effects—while far-forward measures of 
inflation compensation inched down. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
In response to generally favorable earnings news and lower long-term interest rates, 
broad stock price indexes rose 2½ percent to  4½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  The ratio of trend-forward earnings  to share prices for S&P 500 firms held 
steady, but its spread over a long-run real Treasury yield—a  rough gauge of the equity 
risk premium—widened a bit.  On net, imp lied volatility on the S& P 500 index remained 
close to its historical lows. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fe ll about in line with those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities, while yields on speculative-grade co rporate bonds declined 
a bit less.  Risk spreads remained at the low e nd of their range over the past several years.  
Risk spreads on commercial paper, measured by the difference between yields on thirty-
day A2/P2 and A1/P1 paper, were also low— even spreads on paper set to mature over 
year-end.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With the remainder of third-quarter reports  now in hand, operating earnings per share for 
S&P 500 firms rose about 20 percent from four  quarters earlier, up from the 15 percent 
increase anticipated at th e time of the October Greenbook.  The rate implies a solid 
seasonally adjusted quarterly increase of 3½ percent.  Actual reports beat analysts’ 
forecasts by quite a wide margin, and surp rises were widespread across sectors.  
Analysts’ revisions to year-a head earnings for the S&P 500 firms were about unchanged 
in November.  Growth in third-quarter NI PA profits was also high, indicating profit 
growth was broad-based, although the comparison with year-earlier re sults is affected by 
last year’s hurricane-related losses.

III-7 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms has stayed solid overall.  Data for large 
corporations in the third quarter indicate th at, in the aggregate, firms’ balance sheets 
remained highly liquid while corporate leve rage stayed low.  Bond rating upgrades 
outpaced downgrades in October, and the realized six-month trailing bond default rate 
was again near zero.  Third- quarter Call Reports showed th e lowest delinquency rate on 
C&I loans in the past two decades.  Th e near-term outlook for credit quality also 
remained very favorable, as the KMV-based forecast of the aggregate year-ahead default 
rate continued to hover around historical lows. 
 
Business Finance 
Net funds raised by nonfinancial firms in credit markets in October and November 
exceeded the strong third-quarter pace.  Gr oss bond issuance surged in November—to 
more than double its October pace—because of robust issuance by both investment-grade 
and speculative-grade firms.  Reportedly, a significant share of the proceeds from 
investment-grade issues was intended to refi nance existing debt, wh ereas a large amount 
of the speculative-grade issuance was linked to merger and acquisition activity.  On net, 
commercial paper outstanding declined modes tly over October and November, while the 
expansion of C&I loans moderate d some during the same period. 
 Public equity issuance increased further in  November, augmented by the strongest pace 
of IPO activity so far this year.  Private eq uity issuance has also likely remained vigorous 
owing to continued investments by buyout and venture capital firms.  Even so, gross 
equity issuance has been dwarfed by the continued extraordinary pace of equity 
retirements.  Fueled by strong profits a nd ample cash on corporate balance sheets, 
announcements of cash-financed mergers c ontinued apace in October and November, 
while announcements of new repurchase programs have declined only a bit. 
 
Commercial Real Estate 
The recent expansion of commercial mortgage de bt has been rapid, and, at the end of the 
third quarter, debt outstandi ng stood about 14 percent above it s year-earlier level.  On 
net, growth has moderated a little this year, likely a reflection of the rise in commercial 
mortgage rates.  Completed CM BS deals to date and the ca lendar of scheduled offerings 
indicate that issuance will be robust in the current qua rter.  Delinquency rates on 
commercial mortgages—including those b acking CMBS—remained low by historical 
standards, and spreads of yields on invest ment-grade CMBS over those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities tick ed down over the intermeeting period.

Prices of commercial real estate posted anothe r solid increase in the third quarter, thereby 
contributing to a slight further decline in the ratio of net operating income to property 
prices.  The spread of this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield—a rough measure 
of the risk premium on commercial real esta te assets—was little ch anged last quarter, 
staying near its historical average. 
 
Household Finance 
Growth of home mortgage debt declined furt her in the third quarter, in line with the 
slowdown in home-price appreciation and in  housing activity; indeed, on a quarterly 
basis, home mortgage borrowing was the sl owest since 1998.  Interest rates on both 
thirty-year fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages declined over the 
intermeeting period, likely providing some support to mortgage refinanc ing activity in the 
current quarter.  Over the year ending in Oc tober, growth of consumer credit remained 
modest. 
 Although growth of total household debt in  the third quarter was slow by recent 
standards, it outpaced income  growth, nudging the financial obligations ratio to a new 
high.  Nevertheless, on the whole, credit quality  remained favorable, indicating that most 
households are on a solid footing to meet their financial obligations.  The pace of 
bankruptcy filings was subdued, and delinquency rates generally remained low for prime-
rated mortgages and several types of consumer loans.  However, a further increase in the 
delinquency rate on subprime mortgages in Septem ber hints at pockets of financial stress.  
On a dollar-weighted basis, the deterioration in subprime mortgages was somewhat larger 
than on an unweighted basis, suggesting that  the larger subprime mortgages were more 
likely to have turned delinquent. 
 Nationwide, prices of existing hom es rose in the third quarter, but the rate of increase in 
the OFHEO purchase-only price index was the lowest in many years.  Futures quotes on 
the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index suggest  that market participants continue to 
anticipate an outright price decline in coming quarters across ten of the largest 
metropolitan markets, but over the intermee ting period they have become a bit less 
bearish about prices in the first half of 2007.  Even with th e notable rise in stock prices in 
the third quarter, the ratio of  household net worth to disposable personal income was 
virtually the same as in the second quarter.

Net withdrawals from domestic equity mutual  funds abated in October and November, 
and international equity funds and bond funds  continued to register substantial net 
inflows.  
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury auctioned coupon securities of several maturities over the intermeeting 
period.  Overall demand at the auctions was solid, and bid-to-cover ratios were in line 
with or above recent averages.  Over the intermeeting period, indicators of foreign 
demand for U.S. Treasuries were mixed.  Eviden ce generally pointed to elevated foreign 
participation in the two-year nominal note auctio ns.  Indicators of foreign participation in 
auctions of longer-maturity Treasury coupon secu rities, however, were in line with recent 
ranges.  Also, the most recent Treasury Interna tional Capital data showed little change in 
foreign purchases of U.S. Treasur y securities in September.   
 
Trading conditions in the market for nomina l Treasury securities remained favorable.  
Average daily trading volumes have been runni ng a bit higher than last year, and bid-ask 
spreads have stayed near their average leve l this year.  Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s 
stock prices edged down, on net, over the in termeeting period, and spreads on agency 
debt narrowed. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained robust through November.  New 
capital issuance picked up from its solid pace in October, with state and local 
governments continuing to raise funds main ly for investment in transportation and 
education.  Refundings, supported by declines in  long-term interest rates, remained above 
their pace over the first three quarters of the year.  Issuance of short-term municipal 
bonds was modest in October and November.  
 
The credit quality of municipal bonds has cont inued to look solid so far in the fourth 
quarter.  Rating upgrades outpaced downgrades  by a wide margin, and the ratio of 
municipal bond yields to comparable  Treasury securities remained low. 
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 growth picked up to an  average annual rate of 8¼ percent during October and 
November.  The acceleration reflected in creased demand for liquid deposits and 
currency, which had been quite weak in the th ird quarter.  Small time deposits and retail

money funds, whose yields tend to follow mark et rates relatively cl osely, continued to 
grow briskly over the two months ending in November. 
 
Bank credit is estimated to have decelerated markedly to an annual rate of about  
2 percent over October and November, consider ably below the 8 percent pace in the third 
quarter.1  The slowdown reflected reduced growth in each of the core components of 
bank lending.  The expansion of C&I loans moderated to an annual rate of about  
7 percent, and the step-down was concentrated at smaller banks.  Nonetheless, the Survey 
of Terms of Business Lending in November indicated that C&I loan rate spreads 
generally remained low.  Commercial real estate loans increased at a moderate annual 
rate of 5 percent over the pa st two months.  During that period, loans to households 
backed by real estate expanded only slight ly.  Loans to fund consumer purchases, 
adjusted for securitizat ion, expanded modestly. 
 
According to third-quarter Call Reports, bank profitability—measured by both return on 
assets and return on equity—edged down but remained at a high level, while asset quality generally stayed strong.  A further decline in net interest margins last quarter, a likely 
consequence of the flatter yield curve, we ighed importantly on bank profits.  Although 
delinquency rates on all loans and leases edge d a bit higher, charge-off rates held about 
steady at very low levels.  In addition, th e continued low provisioning for loan losses in 
the third quarter suggests that  banks do not foresee a marked deterioration in asset 
quality.

In September, the value of exports of goods and services increased 0.5 percent, following 
a 2.4 percent increase in August.  The Septem ber increase was led by stronger exports of 
industrial supplies and capita l goods.  Among industrial supplies, exports of fuels 
exhibited particularly robust growth, notwithst anding the decline in oil prices, while the 
increase in capital goods exports was accounted for by a surge in aircraft.  In contrast, 
exports of automotive products, consumer goods , and semiconductors registered sizable 
declines in September; and exports of agricultural products, computer s, and services also 
moved down, but by smaller amounts. 
 
In the third quarter, the value of exports of goods and services  increased at an annual rate 
of 11¼ percent.  Strength was widely distri buted across categories, with exports of 
industrial supplies, au tomotive products, and consumer goods exhibiting particularly 
robust growth.  Based on the preliminary NI PA release, real exports of goods and 
services rose 6¼ percent in the quarter.

The value of imported goods and services fe ll 2.1 percent in September after rising 
2 percent in August.  A sharp fall in the va lue of imported oil and natural gas accounted 
for most of the decrease, but non-oil imports also declined.  With in capital goods, lower 
imports of computers, semiconductors, teleco mmunications equipment, and other capital 
goods more than offset a jump in aircraft.  Imports of automotive products and non-oil 
industrial supplies also fe ll back, whereas imports of consumer goods climbed. 
 
In the third quarter, the value of imports of goods and services  increased at an annual rate 
of 13 percent.  The value of imported oil ro se substantially, as oil prices were up, on 
average, from the previous quarter.  Im ports of consumer goods, non-oil industrial 
supplies, and capital goods al so increased robustly in the quarter, whereas imports of 
automotive products fell back and services imports were flat.  Based on the preliminary 
NIPA release, real imports of goods and se rvices rose 5¼ percen t in the quarter. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   Since the last Greenbook, we r eceived BLS trade price data for 
October.  After rising 0.2 percent in Septem ber, prices of non-oil imports fell 0.6 percent 
in October, reflecting in large part a 20 percent decline in im port prices for natural gas.  
Import prices of core goods were up about 0.1 percent on net over the two months, as a 
decline in October—the first in nearly a year—partially offset a small increase in 
September.  These movements in prices of core goods were dominated by changes in 
prices for material-intensive goods.  In Sept ember, import prices for non-fuel industrial 
supplies increased 0.9 percent, as higher prices  for metals were partly offset by falling 
prices for chemicals.  In October, prices of non-fuel industrial supplies fell 0.8 percent, 
reflecting lower prices for build ing materials and metals.  Pr ices for finished goods edged 
up just 0.1 percent in both September and October.  Prices for imported computers cumulatively fell more than 1.5 percent in  those two months, while prices for 
semiconductors were up close to 1 percent on net. 
 
In the third quarter, according to the preliminary NIPA release, core import prices rose at 
an annual rate of 4¼ percent,  primarily reflecting higher pr ices for non-fuel industrial 
supplies.  Prices for capital goods (excludi ng computers and semiconductors) rose almost 
3 percent, the largest increase in over a year.

Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil plummeted 9.7 percent in September and 
8.3 percent in October.  The spot price of We st Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil also 
fell about 8 percent in October and was flat  in November, averaging about $59 per barrel 
each month.  Thus far in December, the spot price of WTI has edged higher to close at 
$62.44 per barrel on December 5.  The sharp de cline in oil prices in September and 
October appears to have reflected an impr oved outlook for oil supply.  However, a long-
running supply disruption in Nige ria, risks to oil production in  Iraq and Iran, and a recent 
cut in OPEC production continue to support oil prices at historically elevated levels. 
 
Exports.   Export prices for total goo ds and core goods each fell 0.4 percent in both 
September and October.  These were the first declines in the indexes since last year, and 
to a large extent they reflect lower prices for exported petroleum products.  As a result of 
the fall in fuel prices, prices for nonagricu ltural industrial supplies fell an average of 
about 1½ percent per month in September and October.  Chemicals prices were also 
down in both months, whereas metals prices we re mixed.  Prices of agricultural exports 
were up on net over the two months.  Exports pr ices for finished goods rose slightly in 
September and October.  Prices of exports  of semiconductors were unchanged during 
those months, while computer prices were up slightly.  In the third quarter, according to the preliminary NIPA release, core export prices rose at an annual rate of 5¾ percent, as  prices increased in all sub-cat egories.  Prices of food and 
industrial su
pplies led the way as each rose at a double-digit pace. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions
 table) were sizeable in the third quarter, but slowed over the months of the 
quarter and dropped to only $5 billion in October.  Year-to-date, however, foreign official inflows have exceeded those for all of 2005 by roughly $40 billion, with inflows from 
China (included in line 1c) accounting for near ly 70 percent of the total.  Partial and 
confidential data on custody account s at FRBNY indicate sizabl e foreign official inflows 
in November, .   
 The chart on Foreign Official Financial Fl ows provides a broader perspective on these 
data.  The G
-10 countries recorded a small infl ow into the United States in October, but 
these flows are volatile and th e trend still remains a modest outflow.  OPEC countries 
registered a small outflow in October – an abrupt change from fairly strong inflows 

IV-8 
earlier in the year.  Inflows from countries other than the G-10 and OPEC slowed for the 
third consecutive month in October, but as the chart makes clear, such dips are common 
even during a period of genera l rising inflows.     
 
Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the table) slowed slightly in the 
third quarter but then gained some momentum in October, as private foreigners returned 
to purchasing a small amount of  Treasury securities (line 4a ).  Purchases of corporate 
bonds (line 4c) slowed from their high in September but remained robust, while there was 
a noticeable pickup in demand for U.S. equities (line 4d).  As shown in the top portion of the chart on Private Securities Flows, the 6- month average of total net private foreign 
purchases of U.S. securities moved up in October, but remained below the high recorded 
earlier this year.  Year-to-da te, total net private purchases are running at ab out the pace of 
2005, with demand having shifted away from Treasuries and toward corporate bonds.   
 
U.S. private acquisitions of foreign securities in October (line 5 of the table and the 
bottom panels of the chart on Private Securities Flows) continued at th eir pace of recent 
quarters.  This year, especial ly in the last six months, in creases in bond purchases have 
offset declines in stock purchases.  In the last two months, however, stock purchases have 
strengthened slightly.  Year-to-date, U.S. private acquisitions are recording a slightly 
stronger pace than that of 2005. 
 
Flows recorded by the banking sector  (line 3) tend to be volatile.  That said, this year we 
have seen primarily inflows, although thes e have slackened from the strong second 
quarter pace.

Foreign Financial Markets  
After reaching a five-month high in mid Octobe r, the dollar’s weighted-average exchange 
value against the other major currencies declined in the second half of October, fluctuated 
little during most of November, and then depr eciated abruptly over the past two weeks. 
On net, the major currencies index fell 2¾ percent over the intermeeting period.  
Moderate downward pressure on the dolla r was provided early in the period by the 
FOMC statement and the releases of a larger-t han-expected decline in  the median price of 
new homes in U.S. for September and of a lo wer-than-expected advance estimate of U.S. 
GDP growth in Q3. The dollar recovered sli ghtly at the beginning of November in 
reaction to the release of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for October. The abrupt 
depreciation of the dollar la ter in the period, which was es pecially pronounced against the 
European currencies, did not coincide with particular data releases that would have 
indicated a change in economic fundamentals.  However, long-term yields in the United 
States declined much more than in most ma jor industrial economies, apparently reflecting 
a downgrade in U.S. growth prospects by investors. On a bilateral basis, the dollar 
depreciated 5¼ percent agains t the euro, 4½ percent against sterling, and 3¼ percent 
vis-à-vis the yen. In contrast, the dollar appreciated about 1¾ percent versus the Canadian 
dollar, in part in reaction to several weaker -than-expected Canadian data releases. After 
holding steady for most of the intermeeti ng period, options-implied volatilities of the 
dollar-euro and yen-dollar exchange rates spik ed up in late November, during the period 
of rapid dollar depreciation; nevertheless,  these volatilities remain close to 
historically-low levels. 
 
Headline equity indexes in the United Kingdom and in the euro area rose early in the 
period to new year-to-date hi ghs but fell back later in the period, in part as market 
participants expressed concerns about the po tential influence of the appreciation of the 
euro and sterling on the earning outlooks of firms. In Japan, the TOPIX fell 2¼ percent 
on balance, in part on growing concerns th at the economy may not be as robust as had 
previously been thought. Reali zed volatilities on headline equity indexes remained low 
during the intermeeting period.  
 
On October 26, Sweden’s Riksbank raised its policy rate 25 basis points, to 2.75 percent. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England raised their policy rates 25 basis points, to 6.25 percent and to 5 percent, respectively, on November 8 and 9. The 
European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada all kept their policy 
stances on hold.  Three-month spot interest rates declined 5 and 3 basis points in Canada 
and in the United States, respectively, whereas they increased 9 to 11 basis points in the 
IV-13 
euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Ten- year nominal sovereign yields declined 
between 13 and 20 basis points on balance in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany, 
but they fell more than 30 basis points in the United States and Canada. Yields on 
inflation-indexed sovereign bonds also d eclined during the intermeeting period, and 
breakeven rates were generally little cha nged in most foreign industrial economies. 
Realized volatilities of te n-year government bonds changed little in most foreign 
industrial economies.  The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value ag ainst the currencies of our other im
 portant 
trading partners declined 1¼ percent on ba lance over the intermee ting period. The dollar 
depreciated between 3 and 4 percent against the Korean won, the Thai baht, and the 
Taiwan dollar. The dollar depreciated 1 percent against the renminbi over the 
intermeeting period, with much of  the move occurring in recent days concurrently with 
the dollar’s depreciation agai nst the major foreign currencie s. In contrast, the dollar 
appreciated ¾ percent on net against the Me xican peso. The Mexican peso’s weakness 
appeared to be linked to political instabil ity related to the pr esidential succession, 
although Mexican stock prices ro se on balance. Headline stoc k market indexes in Latin 
America and emerging Asia increased during the intermeeting period, despite a moderate 
increase in EMBI spreads.  
 The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Real GDP in the advanced foreign economies decelerated further in the third quarter from 
its rapid pace earlier this year, but nonethele ss posted a moderate in crease of 2.1 percent 
(weighted by U.S. exports) at an annual rate .  Euro area growth declined to 2.1 percent 
and Canadian growth softened to 1.7 percent.  Japanese and U.K. GDP rose 2 percent and 
2.7 percent respectively, both with  large rises in investment .  The limited indicators for 
the fourth quarter have been mixed, but on ba lance point to continue d expansion abroad.  
In particular, Japanese industrial produc tion rose strongly in October, euro-area 
confidence and the German IFO hit multi-year highs, and the unemployment rate 
declined in the euro area and Japan. 
 
Headline inflation moved up a bit in most advanced foreign economies, after recent 
declines associated with falls in oil a nd gasoline prices.  Eu ro-area twelve-month 
inflation ticked up to 1.8 per cent in November.  In Octobe r, inflation inched up to 
0.9 percent in Canada and to 2.5 percent in the United Kingdom.  In Japan, by contrast, 
food prices and energy prices fell in October, pushing head line inflation back down to 
0.4 percent.  As expected, the Bank of England raised its policy interest rate 25 basis 
points on November 9. 
 
Japan’s economy accelerated in the th ird quarter, growing at an annual rate of 2 percent. 
Real GDP growth for the sec ond quarter was also revised up  to 1.5 percent.  The pickup 
in growth in the third quar ter came despite a 2.9 percent d ecline in consumption and was 
mainly driven by strong exports and robus t private investment.  Nonresidential 
investment rose 12 percent in the third qua rter, while residential investment posted a 
modest gain after dropping near ly 10 percent in the second quarter.  Exports increased 
11.2 percent as merchandise exports to the Unit ed States and the Mi ddle East picked up 
and export growth to Asia remained strong.  Inventory investment made a 1.2 percentage 
point contribution to growth, but the public s ector nearly offset this as government 
investment continued to dec line steeply, falling 24.2 percent. 
 
Early indicators for the fourth quarter point toward continued strength in investment and 
a further boost from net exports. Industrial pr oduction rose 1.6 percen t in October, with 
particular strength in production of inve stment goods.  Production of high-tech goods 
also rose, and inventories-to-shipments ratio s fell slightly, allaying some concern over a 
recent build up in high-tech inventories. The Ba nk of Japan's measure of real exports rose 
0.3 percent in October while real  imports fell 2.3 percent.  Th ere was also some sign that

the recent weakness in consumer demand ha s abated; real spending by all households 
increased 4.1 percent in October following four consecutive months of decline.  
 
The unemployment rate fell back to 4.1 pe rcent in October and the economy added 
220,000 thousand jobs.  The job offers -to-applicants ratio (the nu mber of officially posted 
job openings relative to the numbe r of officially registered jo b seekers) fell slightly but 
remained at an elevated level.  Despite  these improvements, gross earnings, which 
include bonuses, were 0.1 percent belo w the year-ago level in October.

The headline consumer price index fell 0.3 perc ent in October amid declines in both food 
and energy prices, causing the twelve-month rate of inflation to subside to 0.4 percent.  
Twelve-month core inflation (excluding fr esh food only) was 0.1 percent and consumer 
prices excluding both fresh food and energy fell 0.4 percent from a year ago.  Other 
indicators of inflation were also subdue d.  Year-over-year wholesale price inflation 
slowed to 2.8 percent in Octobe r, while corporate service price inflation remained slightly 
positive for a third consecutive month.  Although the total domestic demand deflator 
increased 0.1 percent from a year ago in the third quarter, the GDP deflator continued to 
decline, falling 0.8 percent.

Euro-area  GDP growth slowed more than expected  in the third quart er to a 2.1 percent 
annual rate.  The slowdown, however, was ex aggerated by a statistical quirk in the 
French data.1  Moreover, final domestic demand in the euro area generally remained 
strong in the third quarter, cons istent with other economic indi cators.  The growth rate of 
private consumption spending rose in the th ird quarter while growth of investment 
spending slowed to a still-solid pace from the very rapid rate in the previous quarter.  Net 
exports subtracted 0.6 percentage points fr om GDP growth in the third quarter, and 
inventory adjustment exerted a slight drag on GDP growth.

declines in inventory accumulation and net exports subtracted 1.4 percentage points and  
0.9 percentage point from GDP growth, respecti vely.  In contrast, final domestic demand 
continued to rise at a relativ ely solid rate, with private c onsumption and fixed investment 
each rising more than 2 percent.  Third-qua rter German GDP growth came in slightly  
                                                 
1 A number of analysts have argued that an inaccurate correction for the Pentecostal holiday in June 
boosted second-quarter growth while depressing third-quarter growth.

weaker than expected, at a 2.6 percent annual rate.  Foreign trade regained its dynamism 
in the third quarter, with net exports contributing 1.8 per centage points to growth.  
Private consumption grew at a solid 2.7 per cent annual rate in th e third quarter, but 
inventory draw-downs subtracted 2 percentage points from growth. 
 
Recent indicators are consistent with a pi ckup in euro-area economic growth in the 
current quarter.  The European Commission survey of euro-area economic sentiment surprised on the upside in October, rising to its highest level in 5½ years, and remained 
near that level in November.  Industrial conf idence moved up further in November to just 
shy of the record level reached in 1989 (and just above the business cycle peaks in 1994 
and 2000).  Germany’s IFO Business Climate Index moved back up in November to the 
15-year peak reached in June.  The IFO cu rrent conditions index continued to surge 
higher; business expectations fo r the next six months edged up  to an above-average level, 
but remained subdued by concerns over the im pact of the VAT increase scheduled for 
January. 
 
The euro-area unemployment rate  edged down in October to 7.7 percent, the lowest rate 
since Eurostat began measuring it in 1993.  Continued improvement in households’ 
perceptions of the employment situation cont ributed to a pickup in euro-area consumer 
confidence for the third straight month in N ovember.  Consumer confidence is at the 
highest level in more than five years but remains well below the previous business cycle 
peak reached in 2000. 
 
Euro-area consumer prices ticked up in November  from the previous month, according to 
a preliminary estimate.  The twelve-month ra te of inflation rose to 1.8 percent from 
1.6 percent in October.  Core inflatio n, excluding energy and unprocessed food, was 
1.6 percent in October, near where it has been in recent months. 
 
In the United Kingdom , GDP moved up 2.7 percent (a.r.) in  the third quarter, continuing 
a period of moderate expansi on that began a year ago.  A surge in gross fixed capital 
formation compensated for more subdued pers onal consumption growth.  The business 
services and finance sector expanded 6.1 per cent, indicating strong business-to-business 
activities.  The reported levels of export s and imports fell by annual rates of 37 and 
32 percent, respectively, as the Treasury inte nsified its fight against a form of VAT 
evasion that had been inflati ng official trade statistics.

Overall economic activity appears to be continuing to rise at a healthy pace in the fourth 
quarter, with consumption expanding solidly  and the growth in business investment 
remaining relatively strong.  In October, retail sales rebounded, expanding 0.9 percent 
after a 0.5 percent decline in September.  H ousing prices kept increasing briskly with 
Halifax and Nationwide, two major British le nders, both reporting twelve-month price 
increases of nearly 10 percent in October and November, respectively.  In November, the 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for services  firmed to 59.8 (50 is the threshold for 
expansion).  Industrial production fell 0.8 per cent in October, while the manufacturing 
PMI in November slid further to 52.6. 
 
The Labor Force Survey measure of the une mployment rate ticked up in August to 
5.6 percent, as the increase in labor force pa rticipation outpaced j ob creation.  Overall, 
employment growth remained solid, with to tal employment standi ng 0.7 percent higher 
than a year earlier.  The claimant-cou nt measure of the unemployment rate was 
3.0 percent in October, a figure unchanged since March.  Wage inflation remains 
contained with average earnings including bonuses rising 3.9 percen t in the year to 
September. 
 
The twelve-month rate of headline CPI infl ation ticked up to 2.5 percent in October 
despite a large downward contribution from the fuels component.  Inflation was pushed 
up mainly by a hike in tuition fees and rising fo od prices.  The twelve -month rate of core 
CPI inflation held steady at 1.6 percent a nd is now running around 1 percentage point

Canadian real GDP rose 1.7 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.   Growth was 
dragged down mainly by a sharp deceler ation in government spending, which was 
attributed to lower expenditures associat ed with the winding down of the 2006 Census; 
government expenditures contributed only 0.1  percentage point to growth after 
contributing 0.9  percentage point in the second quarte r.  In the private sector, personal 
consumption and non-residential business inve stment, which have provided solid support 
to domestic demand for the past few years, accelerated.  Led by spending on durables, 
consumption contributed 2.4  percentage points to overall growth.  In contrast, after a 
housing boom lasting nearly five years, reside ntial construction activity posted a second 
consecutive decline.  The drag from the exte rnal sector waned as exports advanced for 
the first time since the fourth quarter of  2005 and import growth slowed; net exports 
subtracted 0.3 percentage points from growt h, a substantially smalle r drag than in the 
second quarter.    
 
IV-29 
Early indicators for the fourth quarter sugge st continued expansion at about the same 
pace.  Housing starts in October were a b it higher than their th ird-quarter average, 
although the year-long trend in starts is dow nward.  The Ivey PMI slipped a bit in 
November but still indicates expansion of business spending.  The composite index of 
leading indicators rose by 0.2 percent in Oc tober, continuing its string of signals of 
moderate growth since the spring, with household demand remaining the driving force 
behind growth. 
 
In November, total employment posted a solid gain, following strong growth in October 
as well.  Full-time employment fell a bit,  but this comes after smart gains throughout 
much of the year, including through the summ er lull in headline employment growth.  
The unemployment rate edged up to 6.3 percent , still near the 32-year-low of 6.1 percent 
touched in June. 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price infla tion edged up to 1 percent in October.  An 
18-percent plunge in retail gasoline prices  in September was followed by another 
3 percent decline in October, holding down h eadline inflation.  In contrast, the twelve-
month rate of core inflation, which excl udes the eight most volatile components and 
indirect taxes, rose slight ly to 2.3 percent in October,  extending its moderate upswing 
since early this year.  The acceleration in co re prices has been driven by a rise in 
homeowners’ replacement costs, which are es timated using, among other data, prices for 
new homes.  New home pri ce inflation climbed to 12 percent in September, although 
large regional disparities underlie the national index; home prices in the western 
provinces, especially the oil-producing provi nce of Alberta, have risen much more 
rapidly than elsewhere in the country.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data indicate that third-quarter grow th was strong across much of Asia, supported 
in part by high-tech demand, although Ch inese growth slowed considerably.  
Performance was a bit more mixed elsewhere.  Mexican growth slowed a little from its 
strong first half.  In much of South Ameri ca, high prices of commodities continued to 
boost activity, but Brazilian performance was di sappointing.  Inflationa ry pressures have 
remained subdued across much of the emerging market world, aided in part by declines 
in domestic energy prices, but inflation in Argentina, Venezuela, and Turkey remained in 
the double digits. 
 
In China , more evidence has emerged that econo mic activity has slowed in response to 
the recent administrative and ot her tightening measures.  Real  GDP growth in the third 
quarter declined sharply to 7 percent (s.a.a.r .), according to staff estimates.  (China does 
not publish a series showing th e quarterly level of real GDP, so seasonally-adjusted 
growth numbers must be estimated.)  The evidence of slowing is bolstered by other 
incoming data as well.  Fixed investment growth (four-quarter change) slowed from about 30 percent in the second quarter to 22 perc ent in the third quarter .  Industrial output 
increased just 2.8 percent (s.a.) in the third quarter, compared with a 4.1 percent pace in 
the previous quarter.  Further, the moderation in fixed asset investment and in industrial 
output has continued in Octobe r, although Chinese monthly data can be very noisy.   
 
The trade surplus has continue d to balloon, averaging more th an $200 billion at an annual 
rate over the three months from August to October, compared with about $160 billion in 
the second qarter and $100 billion in 2005.  The most recent trade data show a 6 percent 
decline in imports in October, with exports r oughly flat.  Inflation has remained benign in 
recent months, with consumer prices increasing 1.5 percent over the twelve months ended 
in October.  The slowing of imports and economic activity appears to have eased, to 
some degree, Chinese policymakers’ concer ns about the extent of overinvestment.

In Taiwan , third-quarter output surged after regist ering moderate growth in the second

increased, particularly for information and communications products.  Twelve-month

In Korea , economic data continue to indicate m oderate growth.  GDP rose 4.4 percent in 
the third quarter, as c onsumption was weak, net exports were flat, but investment soared.  
In the current quarter, indus trial production rose 2.6 per cent in October, supported by 
strong gains in communications equipment.  Sentiment indicators held steady or were up 
in October, despite the nuclear test in No rth Korea.  The merchandise trade balance 
improved slightly in September and October, and high-tech exports have remained 
strong, particularly to China.  Consumer pr ice inflation has declin ed in recent months, 
reflecting the retrenchment in  oil prices and a decline in food prices after a weather-
related spike in the summer.  In late N ovember, the Bank of Korea announced it would 
raise reserve requirements on short-term deposits  for the first time in almost a decade 
from 5 percent to 7 percent, while lowering reserve requirements on long-term deposits, effective December 23.  The Bank indicated th e move was necessary to curb lending 
growth, and many analysts attributed the ch ange to concern over increases in housing 
prices.

Indian  GDP rose 8 percent in the third quarter, as strong performance in the industrial 
and service sectors more than offset consid erable weakness in ag riculture and mining.  
The trade balance deteriorated significantly fu rther in October.  Twelve-month inflation, 
as measured by both the consumer price inde x and the closely-watched wholesale price 
index, has risen in recent months, reflecting strong domestic demand.  In response to 
higher inflation, the Reserve Bank of India raised its short-term repurchase rate 
¼ percentage point to 7.25 percen t in late October but left its key target rate, the reverse 
repo rate, unchanged at 6 percent.  Market participants interpret the widening of the 
IV-36 
spread between the central bank's lending and borrowing rates as a signal that bank 
would like to slow loan growth.  In addition, the government announced in late 
November that it will slightly reduce pri ces for gasoline and diesel fuel.  A sharp 
improvement in September’s central government  fiscal balance brought the deficit in line 
with the government’s 3.8 percent of GDP target for 2006.

Data from the ASEAN  region indicate that economic ac tivity picked up in the third 
quarter as trade balances  generally improved and domestic demand, notably 
consumption, strengthened in some countries.  Real GDP growth rebounded to 
approximately 6 percent in Malaysia, Singapore , and Thailand, soared to 9 percent in 
Indonesia, but fell back in the Philippines from the strong second quarter rate.  More 
recently, the October trade balances continue  to be strong, but industrial production fell 
in Singapore and Thailand. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in th e region continued to decline due mostly to 
waning effects of last year’s  energy price realignments a nd the previous tightening of 
monetary policy.  In Indone sia, twelve-month inflation plunged to 6.4 percent and 
5.4 percent  in October and November respectively, af ter running in double digits for the 
previous year, as the effect of the sharp reducti on in fuel subsidies in October of last year 
dropped out of the calculation.  Citing the moderation in in flation and the need to 
stimulate domestic demand, Bank Indonesia lo wered interest rates 50 basis points to 
10.25 percent on November 7, the si xth rate reduction since May.

In Mexico , real GDP rose 4.1 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, a mild slowing from the 
strong first half.  While manufacturing ac tivity moderated somewh at and agricultural 
production contracted, the construction and serv ices sectors continued to expand strongly.  
Twelve-month headline inflation was 4.3 pe rcent in October, the second consecutive 
month where inflation has been above the central  bank’s target range of  2 to 4 percent.  
The recent higher-than-expected inflation read ings have been the result of some food 
price increases, mainly for tomatoes.  In la te October, Mexico’s government issued its 
first-ever 30-year fixed ra te peso-denominated bond; an equivalent of roughly 
$200 million was issued at a yield of 8.1 percent.

In Brazil , real GDP rose only 2.0 percent in the third quarter, following equally 
lackluster growth in the second quarter.  Growth was led by solid performance in 
agriculture, while manufacturing output rose only slightly, depressed in part by auto 
strikes in September.  On the demand side , consumption growth slowed considerably 
from the second quarter, suggesting that the influence of government measures aimed at 
boosting consumption in recent years  may be waning.  One bright spot was that gross 
fixed capital formation jumped 10 percent in  the third quarter, following a tepid second 
quarter, but this series is particularly volatile.  October indus trial production was up 
0.8 percent, but that increase in large part  reflected a recovery in auto production 
IV-42 
following strikes in September.  Twelve-mont h consumer price inflation continued to 
decline and was 3.3 percent in October, well below the 4.5 percent midpoint of the 
inflation target.  Core inflation, which excl udes energy and other administered prices and 
home meals, has shown a similar trajectory. 
 
At its November 29 meeting, the Brazilian central bank’s monetary policy committee 
(Copom) lowered its target for the overnight in terest rate 50 basis poi nts to 13.25 percent.  
However, three of the eight committee member s preferred only a 25 basis points decline, 
fueling the perception among market observers  that the central bank may soon reduce the 
pace of monetary easing.  Lula won his re-election bid in late October by a large margin 
against the conservative candida te but has not yet laid out the economic priorities for his 
second term.

In Argentina,  the index of economic activity (a  monthly proxy of GDP) through 
September suggests that growth continued to be  strong in the third quarter.  Also in the 
third quarter, unemployment edged down furt her and industrial production continued to 
climb, albeit more slowly than in the s econd quarter.  Twelve-month inflation through 
November remained elevated, although less than at the end of last year, perhaps partly 
reflecting the price agreements that the government has secured with firms and 
representatives of several sectors.

In Venezuela , GDP growth continued to be in the double digits, up 11 percent in the third 
quarter at an annual rate.  On  a year-over-year basis, oil pr oduction declined 2 percent as 
private oil output plunged by over 11 percent and the output of the government-owned 
firm, PDVSA, was up a meager 1 percent.   Non-oil activity, in contrast, was up 
12 percent, driven by extremely expansionary fiscal policies that have been supported by 
high oil prices.  Monetary policies remain very  expansionary as well, fueling inflation, 
which reached nearly 16 percent in November  on a twelve-month basis.  On December 3, 
as expected, President Chavez was re-elected for another six-year term by a wide margin 
(61 to 38 percent) over Manual Rosales.

In Turkey , industrial production fell 2.7 percent in the third quarte r, in part reflecting the 
effects of sharp increases in interest rate s in the second quarter .  The large current 
account deficit, which stood at over 9 percen t of GDP in the third quarter, remains a 
major concern.  Twelve-month consumer pri ce inflation in November stood at about 
10 percent, well above the 7 pe rcent ceiling of the government ’s inflation target, although 
on a monthly basis, inflation has fallen shar ply in recent months.  Nevertheless, the 
Central Bank of Turkey left its policy rate , the overnight lending rate, unchanged at 
22.5 percent at its November meeting.  Turk ey remains on track with its IMF program, 
but EU accession talks have stalled; further progress appears conditioned on resolution of 
the dispute with Cyprus.

In South Africa , real GDP slowed slightly in the th ird quarter to 4.7 pe rcent. Growth of 
mining production declined despite the recent hi gh prices for metals.  Headline consumer 
price inflation declined on a twelve-month basis, primarily  due to falling petroleum 
prices, but inflation remains an issue because of rising food prices and rapid growth in 
credit to the private sector.  The South African rand streng thened about 10 percent in 
October and November against the dollar, partially reversing its 20 percent decline over 
the second and third quarters.
