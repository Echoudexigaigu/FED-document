Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1                                                 The growth of aggregate output appears to have picked up in the fourth quarter, but 
economic performance remained uneven acro ss sectors.  Consumer spending, buoyed by 
further increases in employment and income, posted robust gains near the end of the year, 
and the demand for housing seems to have stabilized in recent months.  However, 
business fixed investment, after having risen ra pidly earlier in the year , has been soft of 
late, and output in the industrial sector decelerated sharply in  the fourth quarter.  A steep 
run-up in energy prices pushed total inflati on significantly higher in December, but a 
decline in spot prices for crude  oil near the turn of the y ear suggests that retail energy 
prices should move lower again in the next few months.  Core inflation receded markedly in November and December from the el evated levels reached early in 2006. 
 
Labor Market Developments 
Private nonfarm payroll employment incr eased 150,000 in December, bringing the 
average monthly gain in the fourth quarter to  119,000, in line with the average increase in 
the prior two quarters.1  The December rise in privat e employment was nearly all in 
services; professional and business servic es and nonbusiness services again posted 
notable gains.  Job losses in manufacturing a nd in retail trade were modest, and a decline 
in residential construction was mostly o ffset by hiring in nonres idential construction.2  
The average workweek for production or nonsupervisory worker s on private nonfarm 
payrolls remained at 33.9 hours in December, and aggregate hours moved up 0.2 percent.  The fourth-quarter average for aggregate production-worker hours increased 2.2 percent 
at an annual rate from the third-quarter average.   
 
 
1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will revise the March 2006 level of payroll employment in its 
January 2007 employment report.  Based on the BLS pr eliminary estimate, we expect the revision to be 
about 800,000, which would be the largest revision recorded since the BLS switched to a random-sample 
methodology for the payroll survey in 2002.  Benchmark revisions since 2002 have been close to zero, on average.   
2 A strike at Goodyear was settled last month.  About 12,500 workers returned to work at the beginning 
of this month and will be included in January payroll figures.

II-5 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate was unchanged in December at 
4.5 percent, about 0.2 percentage point lower than its level at the middle of last year.3  
The participation rate edged up further and now stands at 66.4 percent, 0.2 percentage 
point higher than its level at  mid-year.  A tighter labor market likely induced some 
individuals who were not in the labor force to  take jobs; the gross flow of nonparticipants 
to employment rose noticeably last year, a nd these flows appear to have reduced the 
percentage of the population categorized as out of the labor force but wanting a job. 
 
Other indicators suggest that  labor demand has remained so lid recently.  The four-week 
moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance was 308,000 as of 
mid-January, near its 2006 average, and la yoff announcements reported by Challenger, 
Gray and Christmas remained at a relative ly low level at year-end.  In addition, job 
openings, as reported by the BLS, moved up late last year.  Net hiring plans, as reported 
by Manpower and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), have moved 
lower recently, but they remain in a range consistent with moderate gains in employment. 
 
Other indicators of labor market tightness suggest little has changed in the balance 
between supply and demand since the middl e of 2006.  According to the Conference 
Board, the extent to which individuals view jobs as readily availa ble remained roughly 
constant over the second half of last year.  Similarly, the number of individuals who 
remain on unemployment insurance rolls until th eir benefits expire (the exhaustion rate) 
has changed little, on net, over the past six m onths.  In contrast, the NFIB’s measure of 
hard-to-fill positions suggested that employers saw some loosening in the labor market at 
the end of last year.  However,  this series is quite volatile. 
 
Industrial Production 
Activity in the industrial sect or was soft for several months last fall but firmed in 
December.  Manufacturing output rose 0.7 percent in December after moving down, on  
                                                 
3 The December employment report included revised seasonal factors for labor force series back to 
January 2002.  Revisions to the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate were small.

balance, between September and November; for the fourth quarter as a whole, factory 
output declined at an annual rate of 1.4 percent.  Although elevated motor vehicle 
inventories and the downturn in homebuild ing have created a substantial drag on 
production in some segments of the industria l sector, sizable gain s in the output of 
commercial aircraft and high-tech  products continue to provide some offset to that drag.  
Outside of manufacturing, unseasonably warm weather in December re sulted in a sharp 
cutback in utilities output, which subtracted  about ¼ percentage point from the increase 
in total industrial producti on.  Meanwhile, mining output was boosted last month by an 
increase in the output of cr ude oil.  Capacity utili zation in manufacturing rose 
0.4 percentage point in December to 80.4 pe rcent, 0.6 percentage point above its 
1972-2005 average.   
 
The pace of light vehicle production remained low in the fourth quarter as automakers 
continued their effort s to better align inve ntories with demand.4  The effects of these 
efforts were also felt in industries related to the motor vehicle sector, such as fabricated 
metal products.  As demand maintained a modest pace, days’ supply fell from 75 days at the end of the second quarter to  around 70 days at the end of the year.  Assembly plans 
for the first quarter of 2007 call for light vehi cle production to edge up only slightly from 
the pace at the end of 2006.  In addition, a ssemblies of medium and heavy trucks are 
expected to decline about 25 pe rcent (not at an annual rate) in the first quarter.  This 
plunge represents a payback for the bump- up in production that occurred in 2006, in  
                                                 
4 As mentioned in the December 2 006 Greenbook, the Bureau of Ec onomic Analysis (BEA) reported 
that gross output of new motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of 29 percent in the third quarter, while 
the industrial production index for mo tor vehicles excluding parts fell at an annual rate of 17 percent over 
the same period.  This discrepancy appears to have been caused by differences between unit production (on which we rely) and unit sales plus net exports and unit inventory investment (on which the BEA relies) and by large fluctuations in the producer price index for light trucks, which the BEA uses to deflate inventories and sales of trucks to businesses.  We believe our es timate of motor vehicle output is more accurate than 
that of the BEA.  Given the most recent data on unit production and pric es, we estimate that anomalies in 
the BEA methodology boosted the contribution of new motor vehicle output to the change in real GDP in 
the third quarter by about 1 percentage point and will pull down the reported contribution in the fourth 
quarter by about the same amount.

advance of the tightening of regulations on emissions by the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) that took effect on January 1, 2007.5
 
Production in high-technology indus tries rose more than 30 per cent at an annual rate in 
the fourth quarter, an increase led by robus t gains in the output of semiconductors and 
computers; in contrast, output of communi cations equipment was soft in the fourth 
quarter.  The expansion of semiconductor ou tput was broadly ba sed.  The continued 
rollout of dual-core chips boosted production of microprocessors, and anticipated demand 
for computers that are recommended for running Microsoft’s new operating system, 
Vista, pushed up production of memory and graphics chips.  The popularity of MP3 
players and flat-panel tele visions supported production of other types of chips. 
 
The production of computers intended for busine sses rose sharply in the fourth quarter.  
A recent Gartner report that demand for larg e servers has been strong was corroborated 
by a jump in fourth-quarter earnings for this product group at both IBM and Sun 
Microsystems.  In contrast, preliminary data  from Gartner indicate that PC sales were 
weak in the fourth quarter, supporting industry anecdotes that consumers have been 
deferring purchases of new computer s until Vista is released.   
 
The production of communications equipment fell nearly 2 percent in December, and 
production in the fourth quarter as  a whole rose at an annual rate  of just 3.6 percent.  The 
recent slowing likely reflects, in part , a leveling off of capital spending by 
telecommunications service providers (TSPs),  which had surged earlier in the year.  
Indicators for the coming year are mixed:  The available earnings reports for the TSPs 
suggest that capital spending, and therefore production, should  pick up again in 2007, but 
the CIO magazine diffusion index for future sp ending on data networking and telecom 
equipment slipped in December and stood well below its level of early 2006.   
                                                 
5 The EPA is tightening emission standards for diesel engines in three stages.  The first phase occurred 
in 2002, the second took effect at the start of this year, and the third is set for 2010.  One manufacturer of 
class 8 vehicles estimates that the new standards add from $9,000 to $12,000 to the cost of a new truck.

Outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-technology, production rose 
0.4 percent in December after three consecuti ve months of decline.  Cutbacks in 
construction activity were felt in industries su ch as construction supplies, other durable 
materials, and construction mach inery.  Elsewhere, output also has softened somewhat in 
recent months.  In particular, the pro duction of business equipment decelerated 
considerably in the fourth quarter as a whole, although it did jump in December.6  
 
The indicators of near-ter m  manufacturing activity, t hough mixed, ticked up on balance 
in December and point to modest gains in production in coming months.  On the 
downside, the three-month moving average of the staff’s series of real adjusted durable 
goods orders, which was little changed in the th ird quarter, declined in October and fell 
0.6 percent in November.  In contrast, the diffu sion index of new orders from the Institute 
for Supply Management (ISM) moved back up to a bit above 50 in December after having fallen below this level in November for the first time in about 3½ years.  The 
early readings on new orders in January from the regional Federal Reserve surveys were 
mixed; the Empire State survey deteriorat ed a bit in January, while the Philadelphia 
Business Outlook survey improved.  However, the responses in both surveys were consistent with continued modest gains in the near term.  Finally, the weekly physical 
data available for first part of January a ppear, on balance, to suggest a small boost to 
industrial production for the month.

The loss of these sales contributed to the dec line
 in the domestic market share of the Big 
Three, which edged down in the fourth quarter. 
 Looking ahead, preliminary sales data from the transplants suggest that sales of light 
motor vehicles in January have been about in line with the pace in Decem 
ber despite a 
sharp decline in incentives.  The preliminary release of the Reuters/University of Michigan index indicated that car-buying attitudes were unchanged over the first half of January; however, they were at a level well above the figures observed this past summer, 
and respondents were less concerned about  gasoline prices.  The Conference Board 
survey in December (not shown) indicated that the number of re spondents who plan to 
buy a new vehicle over the next six months rose  for the first time since last August.   
 
Consumer Spending 
Real PCE appears to have moved up at a robust p
 ace last quarter, with notable strength in 
spending on consumer goods.  Nominal outlays for goods in the control group of retail 
stores, which excludes auto dealerships and building material and supply stores, rose 1.3 percent in December after an increase of 0.8 percent in November.  Factoring in our 
projection of PCE prices, we estimate that real spending on g oods excluding motor 
vehicles rose a robust 0.6 percent in Decembe r after sizable increas es in each of the 
previous three months.  We estimate that real spending on PCE goods increased at an annual rate of 7¾ percent in the fourth quart er.  Real spending on services, in contrast, 
increased only 0.1 percent in November, the most recent month for which data are available; warmer-than-normal temperatures led to a drop in real outlays for energy 
services in November and are likely to have  damped expenditures in that category again 
in December.  
Indicators of spending in January have been generally favorable.  Anecdotal evidence and 
weekly data on chain store sales suggest th at consum
er spending on goods other than

motor vehicles has been well maintained.  In addition, the most recent readings on 
consumer sentiment are at a level cons istent with strong gains in spending. 
 
The fundamental determinants of spending have  been mostly positive.  Real disposable 
personal income posted solid gains in Oct ober and November, reflecting increases in 
wages and salaries and further declines in energy prices.  Nonetheless, the saving rate 
moved down ¼ percentage point in November, to negative 1 percent.  
 
Consumer spending has continued to draw  support from the increases in household 
wealth that have taken place over the past tw o years.  Although house prices appear to 
have decelerated further sin ce the end of the third quarter, robust gains in the stock 
market at the end of 2006 likely implied a sma ll uptick in the wealth-income ratio for the 
household sector.  The boost to consumer sp ending from wealth has likely been muted by 
the lagged effects of the upward trend in  borrowing costs over the past few years. 
 
Housing 
Single-family starts declined 4 percent in December, reversing about half of November’s 
increase.  However, adjusted permit issuan ce in this sector—which is often a more 
reliable indicator of the underlying pace of construction activity than are starts—edged up 
to an annual rate of 1.20 million units after having moved down steadily for the preceding 
10 months.7  Starts in the much smaller multifamily  sector rose sharply in December to 
the upper end of the range th at has prevailed since 1995. 
 
Home sales have been fairly stable since July after having fallen precipitously over the 
preceding twelve months.  In November, sales of existing single-family homes were about unchanged from October at an annual rate of 5.5 million units, while new home 
sales, which dipped in October, rebounded to  an annual rate of about 1.1 million units.  
After having fallen sharply over the preceding year, the index of pending home sales—an

last month but likely had a smaller effect on permits.

indicator of future sales of existing homes— was about flat, on balance, from July to 
November.  The four-week moving average of the index of mortgage purchase 
applications moved up sharply over the same  period and accelerated further in December 
and January.  In addition, the Reuters/Un iversity of Michigan index of homebuying 
sentiment (not shown) has moved up a fair bit since September.  These improved conditions are, in part, the result of a declin e in mortgage rates:  Despite the uptick in 
rates in January, the average rate for thirty -year fixed-rate mortgages is now 50 basis 
points below the level of last July, while average ra tes for one-year adjustable-rate 
mortgages are down about 30 basis points.  Despite the apparent stabilization of housi ng dem

also decelerated sharply over the same period.9   More recently, the average price of  
existing homes sold—which is available on a timelier basis than are the other price 
measures—posted an outright decline in November relative to the previous year.   However, because the measure does not adjust  for changes in the average characteristics 
of homes sold, the declines might reflect a shift in the composition of sales away from 
higher-end homes.  Readings of new home pri ce appreciation have been volatile in the 
past few months, partly because of change s in the geographic composition and average 
quality of homes sold.  However, on a consta nt-quality basis, seasonally adjusted new 
home prices were essentially fl at in the third quarter.  Yet even this soft reading may be 
overstated because homebuilders have been granting more-favorable mortgage terms, paying closing costs, offering optional upgrad es at no cost, and taking other steps to 
bolster sales and unload inventory. 
 
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software appe ars to have fallen in the fourth quarter 
after having risen at a solid pace in the previ ous quarter.  The drop was concentrated in 
the volatile transportation equipment categor y, but expenditures on equipment outside of 
the high-tech and transportation se ctors also appear to have declined in the fourth quarter.  
The modest slowdown in the growth of  business output during 2006 was broadly 
consistent with a slowdown in overall outlays  for equipment and software.  In addition, 
the index of manufacturing- sector activity from the ISM and the index for general 
activity from the Philadelphia Fed's Busine ss Outlook Survey both suggest that business 
sentiment has deteriorated on balance since last summer.  However, changes in other 
fundamentals of business spending, such as the continued decline in th e cost of capital for 
high-tech goods and robust real corporate cash flow, will likely continue to support  
                                                 
9 Unlike the OFHEO index, which captures only sales backed by conforming mortgage loans, the 
Case-Shiller index reflects all arms-length sales transac tions in the included cities.  The cities covered by 
the Case-Shiller index are Boston, Chicago, Denver , Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San 
Diego, San Francisco, and Washington.  A new, twen ty-city version of the Case-Shiller index, formed 
using the same methodology as the ten-city index, was unveiled in D ecember.  This monthly index is 
available only from 2000 onward, and its rate of appreciation over this limited sample is similar to that of 
the ten-city index.

increases in business spending.  The diffusion index of capital spending plans in the ISM 
semiannual report (released in December) sugge sts that manufacturers plan to increase 
capital expenditures in 2007 at a bout the same rate as in 2006. 
 
Business spending on transportation equipment appears to have declined considerably in the fourth quarter.  
 
 business outlays on airc raft are likely to have dropped for a third 
consecutive quarter.10  In contrast, sales of medi um and heavy trucks (classes 
4 through 8) surged to a record-high annua l rate of 600,000 units in December after 
having maintained high levels all year.  Much of the strength in truck demand likely reflected the change in EPA regulations on truck engine emissions, which pulled some 
sales into 2006.  Now that the new regulati ons are in effect, production and sales are 
expected to recede considerably this quarter; indeed, new orders for medium and heavy trucks fell sharply at the end of the year.    Investment in high-tech capital goods likely pos ted subpar growth in the f
 ourth quarter.  
For computing equipment, the level of nominal shipments in November was only a little above the third-quarter average, a sign that real spending for the fourth quarter as a whole 
will be modest.  Weak nominal shipments of  communications equipment in October and 
November point to a decelerati on in spending in the fourth quarter as a whole from the 
brisk pace seen earlier in the year.  Outside of high-tech and transportation, business outlays appear to have declined in the fourth quarter.  Dom
estic shipments have been fairly flat, on balance, in recent months, 
and imports of these goods have been quite weak.  Orders fell sharply in November, 
largely because of a drop in orders in constr uction-related industries such as construction 
machinery and heating and ventilation equipm ent, in which bookings had been running  
                                                 
10 Shipments of aircraft from domestic producers to foreign airlines were robust in October and 
November, but domestic expenditures remained weak.

unusually high relative to shipments.  Nonethel ess, the backlog of unfilled orders remains 
sizable—a situation that bodes well for shipments in the coming months. 
 
Nonresidential Construction   
The available data through November suggest that investment in nonresidential structures 
decelerated late last quarter after robust increases in the first three quarters of 2006.  
Nonetheless, fundamentals in the sector rema in solid:  Vacancy rates in the office and 
industrial categories have moved down stead ily over the past few years and are now 
somewhat below their historic averages.  Th e vacancy rate in the retail sector has 
remained at a low level since 2000.11   In addition, the arch itectural billings index—
which is correlated with changes in nonresiden tial construction at a lead time of about six 
months—has rebounded in recent months afte r having dipped substa ntially last spring.12   
 
Drilling and mining activity, which soared over the first half of 2006, has decelerated.  In 
the third quarter, real expenditu res on drilling and mining struct ures rose at an annual rate 
of 10 percent, down from an in crease of nearly 30 percent in the second quarter.  The 
total number of drilling rigs in operation has tracked sideways, on net, since September, 
which suggests that spending growth in this se ctor has slowed in recent months.  This 
deceleration may in part reflect the decline in energy prices since last summer and the 
drag on activity from short-term bottl enecks in equipment and skilled labor. 
 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory investme nt excluding motor vehicles was slightly higher in the 
third quarter than in the second quarter.  Our interpretation of the book-value data  
                                                 
11  In this Greenbook, we have switched measures of vacancy rates—from those produced by Costar to 
those produced by the National Council of Real Esta te Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF).  The NCREIF 
measures have registered steeper d eclines in recent years than those fr om Costar, but the two measures are 
currently at similar levels. 
12 About 88 percent of the construction projects covered by the architectural billings index are 
nonresidential.

through November, adjusted for changes in in ventory acquisition cost s, suggests that the 
rate of stockbuilding was about unc hanged in the fourth quarter.   
 
Business inventories appear to be somewhat elevated relative to sales.  The November 
book-value ratio of inventories to sales for the manufacturing and trade category 
(excluding motor vehicles) was near its highest level since February 2005.  Although 
many of the industries with elevated invent ory-sales ratios in the book-value data are 
associated with the homebuilding and motor vehicles sectors, imbalances have more 
recently begun to appear in a few other sectors as well.  The staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system also suggest s that inventories are elevated, though not to the same 
extent as implied by the Census data; indus tries that supply the troubled homebuilding 
and motor vehicle sectors accounted  for most of the increase. 
 
For the third month in a row, the ISM index on customers’ inventor ies in manufacturing 
in December remained above 50, a level in dicating that the number of purchasing 
managers viewing such inventories as too high exceeds the number viewing them as too low.  That said, about two-thirds of responde nts still consider their customers’ inventory 
levels appropriate.   
 
Federal Government Sector 
The federal unified budget improved furthe r during the fourth quarter, as outlays 
decelerated significantly and receipts slowed only a bit; however, a portion of the slowing 
in outlays reflected temporary factors.  Outla ys in the fourth calendar quarter were about 
unchanged from their year-earlier level, a significant deceleration from the rates of 
increase posted over the past couple of years.  However,  outlays were held down by 
transitory factors such  as $13 billion in proceeds from  electromagnetic spectrum auctions 
and delays in spending arising from failure to complete the fis cal 2007 appropriations

bills.13  In addition, recent low readings on th e consumer price index (CPI) caused low 
financing costs to be recorded for Treasur y inflation-protected securities; spending  
related to the 2005 hurricane seas on has tailed off; and Medicaid  outlays continue to be 
unusually subdued.14   In contrast, defense spending picked up in the fourth quarter and 
points to a sizable increase in real NIPA defense purchases from the third-quarter level. 
 
Receipts in the fourth calendar quarter were 8 percent above the year-earlier level, a 
somewhat smaller gain than that recorded over th e past two years.  The rate of increase in 
corporate income tax payments slowed over the period but still rose a hefty 22 percent 
over the past year.  Collections have been running ahead of overall profit growth over the 
past several years, a development that ma y reflect factors such as changes in the 
distribution of profits toward  firms with positive tax liabilities, a decline in loss 
carryforwards, and increased corporate capital ga ins realizations.  I ndividual income tax 
collections rose 7½ percent, an increase  paced by large gains in nonwithheld tax 
collections.  New tax data from the Congr essional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that 
individual capital gains real izations surged in 2005 a nd were nearly double the 2003 
level.  Payments on these liabilities likely  contributed to the tax surprises in 2005 and 
2006. 
 
In December the Congress passed a continui ng resolution to fund the government through 
February 15 because only two of the twelve regular appropriations bills had been completed.  The new Congress has yet to take up these appropriations bills, and press 
reports suggest that a conti nuing resolution for the balance of the year may be in the 
offing.  The House passed a PAYGO rule that would place some rest rictions on tax and 
mandatory spending bills that increase the defi cit over periods of five to ten years; the 
Senate is expected to pass a similar rule that would probably put more bite on the actual  
                                                 
13 Asset sales are recorded as negative entr ies on the outlays side of the budget. 
14 These expenditures have been even lower than can be explained by the shift in spending for 
prescription drugs from Medicaid to Medicare.

        1.  The on-budget surplus excludes the Social Security surplus and the Postal Service, which are off-budget. The
baseline assumes that budget authority for discretionary programs grows with inflation after fiscal 2006 and that no newmandatory spending or tax legislation is enacted.        2.  The adjustment reflects the CBO’s estimates of an alternative policy scenario in which additional supplementalfunding for the war on terror would increase spending above the baseline projection over the next 3 years, but it alsoassumes a subsequent phasing down of military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of an extension of currentappropriations for such activities.        3.  Negative values indicate the effect on the surplus and reflect an increase in outlays.

legislative process.  Indeed, the Senate Finance Committee is considering a minimum 
wage bill with small business tax cuts offset by some revenue raisers.  
 
According to the new Budget and Economic Outlook from the CBO, the budget deficit is 
estimated to improve further this year.  The baseline budget projection, which assumes 
that current tax law and policies are maintained, shows the deficit falling from $248 billion in fiscal 2006 to $172 billion in  fiscal 2007 and $98 billion in fiscal 2008.
15  
However, if additional funding for Iraq is a pproved and the AMT relief as well as other 
tax provisions are extended, th en the deficit is projected to  be around $200 billion in both 
2007 and 2008. 
  
State and Local Government Sector 
Data on the state and local government sector  indicate that real purchases posted solid 
increases in the latter part  of 2006.  Employment rose 32,000 per month over the second 
half of 2006, a sizable pickup from the m onthly average of 14,000 during the previous 
year and a half.  Nominal outlays for st ate and local construction in October and 
November were about 8 per cent (annual rate ) above the third-quart er average, though 
much of the increase likely reflects highe r prices for construction-related materials. 
 
Moderate spending increases and robust ta x collections contributed to a further 
improvement in state budget balances in fi scal 2006, which ended on June 30 in most 
states.  The National Associa tion of State Budget Officers ( NASBO) reported that fiscal 
2006 year-end balances were almost 10 percen t of general fund expenditures, a rate 
significantly above the 5 percen t threshold generally considered to constitute adequate 
fiscal reserves.  According to NASBO, the high level of reserves has prompted some states to increase spending and lower taxes, actions suggesting that the exceptional fiscal 
caution exhibited over the past few years is starting to dissipate. 
                                                 
15 The baseline budget projection assumes that AMT relief lapses after 2006 and that the 2001-03 tax 
cuts expire as scheduled at the end of 2010.  In addition, the CBO assumes that discretionary spending, 
which includes the $70 billion approved last fall for operat ions in Iraq and Afghanistan, rises with inflation.

Prices 
A surge in energy prices pushed up the CPI 0.5 percent in December, the first increase 
since August; excluding food and energy, consum er prices increased 0.2 percent in 
December after having been unchanged in November—notably more modest than the 
increases posted earlier in the year.  We estimate that overall PCE prices increased 
0.4 percent in December; they rose 2.3 pe rcent over the twelve months of 2006, down 
0.6 percentage point from the increase duri ng the preceding year, when energy prices 
rose sharply.  We estimate that core PCE prices increased 0.2 percent in December and 
that they rose 2.3 percent over the twelve months of 2006, up 0.2 percentage point from a 
year earlier. 
 
Large swings in energy prices have continue d to dominate changes in headline consumer 
prices.  We estimate that the energy com ponent of PCE prices rose 5 percent in 
December after having fallen in the preceding three months, but the twelve-month change 
in energy prices rose only an estimated 4 percent, down sharply from the 16.5 percent rise in 2005.  Gasoline and motor oil prices a ppear to have jumped about 8 percent at the 
retail level last month, as both crude costs and margins moved up.  Furthermore, natural 
gas rates continued their rebound in December, thereby reversing their drop in October.  
However, warmer-than-expected temperatures  this winter have left inventories of 
petroleum products and natural gas near the top of their hi storic ranges for the season, 
while the spot price for crude oil has dr opped sharply, on balance, since December.  
These factors should push down retail prices in January, and the available survey data 
suggest that consumer ener gy prices have been moving lower in recent weeks. 
 
Core consumer price inflati on has come down from the elev ated levels reached earlier 
this year.  We estimate that core PCE pri ces rose 0.2 percent in December after a flat 
reading in November; such an increase would bring the three-month change to an annual 
rate of 1.8 percent, down from its peak of 2.9 percent in May.  The slowdown reflects, in 
large part, a deceleration in core goods pric es, which may have been boosted last spring 
by the pass-through of higher energy costs.

We estimate that the PCE price index for food and beverages was flat again in December.  
The index for fresh fruits and vegetables fell slightly in December after several months of 
wide swings.  Recent winter storms in the plains states hindered livestock production but 
also provided vital moisture for the winter wheat crop; current estimates by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture point to ample supplies of crops and livestock in coming 
months, a situation that should hold down pr ice increases for food items.  An extended 
freeze in January caused considerable damage to  fruits and vegetables in the West.  The 
navel orange crop appears to have suffered the most damage, and spot prices on that 
product roughly doubled in the days immediately after the freeze.16
 
December’s reading notwithstanding, the declin e in energy prices over recent months 
seems to have contributed to an easing of inflation expectations as measured by the 
Reuters/University of Michigan index.  Surv ey data for January show that median one-
year-ahead inflation expectations have b een unchanged, on balance, since the December 
Greenbook at 3.0 percent, down from its recent  peak of 3.8 percent in August.  The 
median value of five- to ten-year-ahead expectations also held steady at 3.0 percent in January, down from 3.2 percent in August. 
 
At earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core intermediate 
materials edged down 0.1 percent in Decem ber after a decline of 0.3 percent in 
November.  Some of the downward pressure on the core intermediate PPI can be traced to declines in energy-intensive components, which likely reflect the large fall in energy 
prices in the preceding months.  Prices of core intermediate goods increased 4.7 percent 
over the twelve months ending in December,  about the same percentage as in the 
preceding year. 
 
After rising sharply over most of 2006, commodity prices have moved down a bit since 
the December Greenbook.  The Commodity Resear ch Bureau spot index of industrial  
                                                 
16 Other crops such as strawberries, lettuce, and broccoli were also damaged; however, these crops 
typically recover after a month or so.

Commerce  index of industrial materials has in creased 1¼ percent over the same period

Labor Costs 
Labor costs have moved up at a moderate p ace over the past year, and the markup of 
prices over unit labor costs remains quite el evated.  Relying on the final GDP release for 
the third quarter, the staff estimates that th e third-quarter change in compensation per 
hour will be revised up 0.5 percentage point, to  an annual rate of 3.1 percent.  Available 
data suggest that the increase in compensa tion per hour in the fourth quarter may be 
somewhat higher than in the third quarter.  Overall, th e four-quarter change in 
compensation per hour for 2006 appears on track for a 4.9 percent increase.  Increases in 
average hourly earnings of 0.3 percent in  November and 0.5 percent in December 
brought the twelve-month change for 2006 to 4.2 percent, up from 3.2 percent in 2005.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Against a backdrop of stronger-than-exp ected incoming data on economic activity, 
favorable readings on core inflation, and a sh arp drop in oil prices, market participants 
pushed back the timing and reduced the extent of policy easing that they anticipate this 
year and next.  The term structure of nomina l Treasury yields shifted up about a quarter 
percentage point in a largel y parallel fashion over the in termeeting period.  Yields on 
Treasury inflation-protected s ecurities (TIPS) rose by a sim ilar amount, leaving inflation 
compensation little changed.  Equity price inde xes were little changed as the impact of 
generally favorable earnings news  was apparently offset by ri sing interest rates.  Risk 
spreads on corporate bonds remained low as the outlook for corporate credit quality in the 
near term continued to be solid.  Despite a rise in delinquencies on subprime mortgages, 
household credit quality on the whole rema ined favorable.  Commercial bank credit 
continued to expand last quarter but at a signif icantly slower pace than  earlier in the year. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to leave the target federal funds rate 
unchanged and to make only modest changes to the accompanying statement was largely 
anticipated by market particip ants.  The subsequent release of the minutes from the 
December meeting elicited little reaction in financial markets.  Rather, stronger-than-
expected economic data led inve stors to mark up their expected  path for monetary policy.  
Current quotes indicate that investors conti nue to place high odds on the FOMC keeping 
the target federal funds rate at 5.25 percent th rough the next three m eetings.  After that, 
money market futures suggest that investors anticipate a bout 25 basis points of easing by 
the end of 2007 and roughly another 25 basi s points by the end of 2008—almost 40 basis 
points less in cumulative easing th an investors had priced in at  the time of the last FOMC 
meeting.  Option-implied measures of uncerta inty about the path of policy dropped to 
near their historical lows, and the skew towa rd lower rates in the implied distribution of 
the funds rate about six months ahead became less pronounced.   Consistent with the upward shift in polic y expectations, two-year nominal Treasury 
yields increased about 30 ba sis points over the intermeeting period, and ten-year yields 
rose a similar amount.  Yields on TIPS rose a bout as much as their nominal counterparts, 
leaving inflation compensation little change d, as the stronger-than-expected economic 
outlook offset the effects of the sharp decline in oil prices and the favorable readings on 
core inflation over th e intermeeting period.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes we re little changed over the intermeeting period as the 
generally favorable earnings news and stronge r-than-expected economic data presumably 
were counterbalanced by the rise in interest rates.  The sharp decline in oil prices led to a 
substantial selloff in energy stocks but appeared to have little effect  on the broader equity 
market.  The spread between  the twelve-month forward tr end earnings-price ratio for 
S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk 
premium—narrowed a bit over the intermeeting pe riod but remained within the range that 
has prevailed over the past few years.  Im plied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained 
close to its historical lows.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose  a shade less than those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities, while yields  on speculative-grade corporate bonds were 
little changed.  As a result,  corporate bond risk spreads moved down slightly from 
already low levels.  Near-term BBB forward spreads are currently near their all-time 
lows, but comparable far-term forward spread s are about average.  The narrow near-term 
forward spreads suggest that i nvestors perceive little credit ri sk in the short run, while the 
wider spreads farther ahead suggest that investors are requiring a typical amount of 
compensation for credit risk beyond the next few years.  Spreads on commercial paper 
(not shown) remained low across year-end.  
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
The fourth-quarter earnings season began with major financ ial firms announcing results 
that exceeded analyst estimates by wide margin s; aside from a few disappointments in the 
technology sector, subsequent reports have been generally  favorable.  Based on the 
results already in hand and analyst forecasts for firms yet to report, the staff estimates that 
operating earnings per share for the S&P 500 grew about 10 percent over the year ended 
in the fourth quarter, a sharp deceleration fr om the remarkably strong pace earlier last 
year.  Revisions to year-ahead earnings m oved into negative territory, although much of 
the decline was accounted for by the energy sector.   Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms appears to have remained strong.  The 
most recent data on corporate balance sheets (f or the third quarter of 2006) indicate that 
cash holdings relative to assets re mained high and that the ratio of debt to assets remained 
low.  In the fourth quarter, bond rating downgr ades were modest and nearly balanced by 
upgrades.  In addition, the realized six-mont h trailing bond default rate was again near 
zero in December, and the delinquency rate on C&I loans in the third quarter was the

lowest in the past two decades.  The near -term outlook for credit quality also appears 
extremely favorable, as the December forecast of the aggregate year-ahead default rate 
based on the KMV model was at  its lowest level since 1998. 
 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms slowed a bit in December from the torrid pace 
earlier in the quarter and has cooled somewhat further in Ja nuary.  However, the forward 
calendar includes several sizable deals, sugge sting that bond issuance will strengthen in 
coming months.  As has been the case in th e past few quarters, issuance of speculative-
grade bonds continued to be boosted by hefty merger and acq uisition financing, while a 
notable fraction of the proceeds from inve stment-grade issuance has been used for 
refinancings.  Commercial paper outstandi ng surged in December, mostly among firms 
that had recently announced larg e acquisitions, and is on track to increase substantially in 
January as well.  C&I loans rose moderately in December, in line with their average rate 
of increase in the fourth quarter.  Aggreg ating across bonds, commercial paper, and C&I 
loans, net debt financing was robust in the fourth quarter, exceedi ng the already strong 
pace registered over the pr evious three quarters.  
 Public equity issuance maintained its rece nt solid pace in December, mostly on the 
strength of seasoned equity offerings, follo wed by the usual seasonal lull around the turn 
of the year.  Private equity issuance in the f ourth quarter is estimated to have matched its 
robust third-quarter pace, fueled in part by st rong leveraged buyout (L BO) activity.  Still, 
gross equity issuance continued to be dw arfed by the extraordinary pace of equity 
retirements.  Boosted by strong profits a nd ample cash on corporate balance sheets, 
retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions reached a new record high in the fourth quarter, and almost half of these reti rements were from LBO deals.  Retirements 
from share repurchases are estimated to be only a bit shy of their record third-quarter 
pace.  
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Although the growth of commercial mortgage de bt has eased a bit ove r the past several 
quarters, perhaps restrained by an upward dr ift in commercial mortgage rates, debt 
growth in this sector remains rapid.  Issu ance of commercial-mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS) was very strong last year, and th e calendar of scheduled CMBS offerings 
suggests that issuance will remain heavy this qu arter.  Spreads of yields on investment-
grade CMBS over those on comparable-maturity  Treasury securities were little changed 
at low levels, as delinquency rates on comme rcial mortgages—includ ing those backing

CMBS—remained low.  Growth of commercial r eal estate prices continued to be rapid 
through the third quarter, while rent s increased only moderately.   
 
Household Finance 
Interest rates on both fixed-rate and adjust able-rate mortgages rose slightly over the 
intermeeting period, but they remained below their recent peaks in mid-2006.  Despite the decline in rates since midyear, mortgage debt growth slowed sharply in the third 
quarter as home prices decelerated and sales softened, and the staff expects that mortgage 
borrowing moderated further last quarter.  Cons umer credit has continued to increase at a 
tepid pace.     Although the financial obligations  ratio for the household se ctor in the third quarter 
remained close to its historical high, readings  on household credit qual ity continued to be 
favorable on the whole.  Delinquency rate s on consumer loans and prime mortgages—
which account for the vast majority of total household debt—remained low, but the delinquency rate on subprime mortgages rose fu rther in November.  The spreads relative 
to LIBOR on newly introduced credit default swap indexes for the lowest-rated tranches 
of pools of subprime mortgages originated in  the first half of 2006 have risen sharply 
over the past few months.  The jump suggests that investors have grown more concerned 
about the credit quality of recently originated subprime mortgages.  
 Home-price appreciation as measured by the OFHEO purchase-only index slowed 
considerably further in the th ird quarter from its year-ago le vel.  Available indicators 
suggest that the year- over-year growth of home prices decelerated again in the fourth 
quarter.  The trajectory of exp ected home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets 
over the next few quarters, derived from fu tures quotes on the S&P/Case-Shiller home-
price index, edged up on net over the interm eeting period, although investors apparently 
continue to expect price declines in thes e markets.  Despite the deceleration in home 
prices, the sharp rise in stock prices in th e fourth quarter likely nudged up the ratio of 
household net worth to disposable personal income.    Net inflows to long-term mutual funds were r obust late last year a nd were propelled by 
strong inflows to international equity funds and bond funds.  Inflows to domestic equity 
funds turned positive in the fourth quart er after two quarter s of outflows.

Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury has modestly trimmed aucti on sizes for some coupon securities amid 
continued improvements in the federal budget.  Also, in preparation for its midquarter 
refunding, to be announced next week, the Treas ury solicited the primary dealers’ views 
on possible further reductions in its auction calendar.  During the intermeeting period, the 
Treasury auctioned two-, five -, and ten-year nominal c oupon securities and ten-year 
TIPS.  The auctions for nominal coupon securi ties were well received, and indirect bids, 
a rough indicator of demand from foreign official  institutions, were generally in line with 
recent historical averages.  However, overa ll demand and indirect bidder participation 
were tepid at the ten-year  TIPS auction.  Other measures of foreign demand for 
Treasuries held roughly steady, as both forei gn custody holdings of Treasury securities at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (F RBNY) and foreign purchases of notes and 
bonds, based on the most recent data from th e Treasury Internationa l Capital reporting 
system for November, were little changed fr om the previous month.  Bid-ask spreads and 
volume in the market for on-the-run Treasury se curities suggested that trading conditions 
through year-end remained comparatively liquid.    On January 5, Freddie Mac announced an es timated $550 million loss for the third 
quarter; the drop reflects a re versal of earlier mark-to-mark et gains on derivatives and 
credit guarantees.  The stock prices of bot h Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae dropped in the 
wake of that announcement and fell about 5 pe rcent on net over the intermeeting period.   
Demand for GSE debt from overseas invest ors reportedly remained robust, and the 
foreign custody holdings of GSE and agency securities at the FRBNY continued to 
increase.   Agency senior debt spreads ove r comparable-maturity Treasuries were about 
unchanged over the intermeeting period.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds strengthened further in December, largely 
because of a near-record amount of new capita l issuance, as state and local governments 
continued to invest heavily in transportati on and education projects.  Meanwhile, advance 
refundings slowed in December to about thei r average pace in 2006, partly in response to 
the rise in interest rates; issuance of short- term municipal bonds continued to be modest.  
In January, both long-term and short-term municipal bond issuance slowed.  However, 
issuance of long-term municipal bonds, particularly new capital issuance, is likely to pick 
up in the near future given the sizable bond capacities approved in a number of states in 
the elections last November.

The credit quality of municipal bonds remain ed solid over the intermeeting period.  The 
number of bonds with rating upgrades c ontinued to far outpace the number with 
downgrades, and the ratio of municipal bond yiel ds to Treasury yields remained low.  
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at a rather rapid 8¼ percent a nnual rate over December and January.  In 
part, this vigorous growth reflects the cumula tive effect of declines  in opportunity costs 
since the middle of 2006; but the extent of the pickup in growth of liquid deposits -- 
which account for about 60 percent of M2 asse ts -- was surprising.  Retail money market 
funds continued their blistering advance.  By contrast, small time deposits have slowed of 
late; currency growth was held down by weak overseas demand.   Commercial bank credit expanded at an annual rate of about 4½ percent in the fourth 
quarter, a significant step-down from the 11 percent pace posted over the first three 
quarters of last year.
1  The slowdown was driven by reduced growth in each of the core 
components of bank lending.  C&I loans slow ed from their exceptionally strong pace 
earlier in the year but remained robust,  amidst a continued accommodative lending 
environment.  The January Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey indicated that banks, on 
net, had further eased some credit terms on C&I loans while leaving lending standards 
little changed on balance over the past three m onths.  Commercial real estate loans also 
decelerated in the fourth quarter; survey respondents reported, on net, both a weakening 
in demand and some tightening of credit standa rds for such loans.  Growth in loans to 
households also moderated last quarter, as residential mortga ge loans only edged up after 
posting fairly strong increases earlier in the ye ar; consumer loans cont inued to rise at a 
moderate pace in the fourth quarter.

Appendix 
III-A-1 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The January 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.  The survey also contained special  questions about changes in terms on commercial 
real estate loans during 2006, the effects of th e 2005 bankruptcy reforms, and expected changes 
in asset quality over 2007.  This  appendix is based on responses from fifty-five domestic banks 
and twenty-two foreign banking institutions.    Overall, the survey respondents reported mixe d changes in lending standards and terms in 
January, while demand for most loan types was reportedly somewhat weaker.  Domestic and 
foreign institutions noted that they had eased  some terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) 
loans over the past three months, while credit standards on such loans had changed little.  By 
contrast, domestic respondents indicated that th ey had tightened credit standards on commercial 
real estate loans over the previous three months .  Demand for C&I loans at domestic banks was 
reportedly little changed, on balance, in the January survey, while demand for commercial real 
estate loans at these institutions was said to have weakened over the past three months.  Foreign 
institutions, by contrast, reported that they ha d experienced stronger demand for commercial real 
estate loans over the same period.  In the household sector, domestic respondents noted that they had tightened credit standards on residential mo rtgage loans over the survey period, while 
demand for such loans continued to weaken.  Lending standards and terms on credit card and 
non-credit-card consumer loans were little changed in the January survey, but a considerable net 
fraction of domestic banks reported that they had seen weaker demand for consumer loans over 
the past three months.  Regarding the special questions, domestic and foreign institutions reported that terms on 
commercial real estate loans were generally little changed over the past year, although a 
considerable net fraction of dom estic respondents noted that they had trimmed spreads of loan 
rates over their cost of funds.  In response to  the special questions on the effects of the 2005 
bankruptcy reforms, domestic banks  reported that they had not changed their lending policy for 
credit card loans as a result of the reforms.  Nevertheless, a significant fraction of these 
institutions anticipate that charge-offs on such lo ans will be somewhat lower in the long term.  
Considerable net percentages of both foreign a nd domestic institutions reportedly expect credit 
quality on loans to businesses and households to deteriorate somewhat in 2007.   
Business Lending  
In the January survey, domestic institutions repor ted that credit standards on C&I loans to large 
and middle-market firms were unchanged, on net, over the past three months.  These respondents, 
however, noted that they had eased some terms on C& I loans to such firms over the same period.

survey—indicated that they had trimmed spreads of  loan rates over their cost of funds over the 
past three months, while smaller net fractions re ported that they had reduced the costs of credit 
lines or eased loan covenants.  Credit standards on C&I loans to small firms were also reportedly 
little changed, on balance, in the January survey, but almost 30 percent of domestic banks, on net, 
reported that they had trimmed spreads of loan ra tes over their cost of funds for such customers 
over the past three months.     As they did in the previous survey, U.S. bran ches and agencies of foreign banks reported that 
their standards on C&I loans had changed little ove r the past three months. However, significant 
net fractions of these institutions indicated that  they had increased the maximum size of credit 
lines, eased loan covenants, and narrowed spread s of loan rates over their cost of funds. 
 Nearly all domestic banks and all U.S. branch es and agencies of foreign banks that indicated 
having eased their lending standards and terms in  the January survey cited more-aggressive 
competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done 
so.  A notable percentage of domestic institutions  also pointed to a more favorable or a less 
uncertain economic outlook, while considerable fr actions of foreign institutions cited increased 
liquidity in the secondary market for such loans and increased tolerance for risk as reasons for 
their move toward a less stringent lending posture.   At both domestic and foreign institutions, dema nd for C&I loans was reportedly little changed, on 
balance, over the past three months.  Among dom estic institutions that experienced stronger 
demand for C&I loans, more than 80 percent cite d a rise in merger and acquisition activity as a 
reason for stronger loan demand, while about two-th irds pointed to borrowers’ increased needs to 
finance investment in plant or equipment.  Among domestic respondents that saw weaker demand 
for C&I loans, two-thirds attributed the soft ening to borrowers’ decr eased needs to finance 
investment in plant or equipment, while about 50 percent cited borrowers' decreased financing 
needs for accounts receivable or a shift in custom er borrowing to another bank or to nonbank 
sources of credit.     Regarding future business, a small net fraction of  domestic respondents indicated that the number 
of inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased over the previous three months. By 
contrast, 10 percent of foreign respondents, on ba lance, reported that the number of inquiries 
from potential business borrowers had increased in January.  About one-fourth of domestic institutions—a some what smaller net fraction than in the October 
survey—reported that they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans over 
the past three months.  About 35 percent of  domestic respondents—a slightly larger net 
percentage than in the previous survey—indicated  that they had seen weaker demand for such 
loans over the same period. At foreign instituti ons, by contrast, lending standards on commercial 
III-A-5 
real estate loans were unchanged, on net, in the January survey; in addition, about one-fifth of 
these institutions reported that they had experienced stronger demand for such loans.   For several years, the January su rvey has asked banks to report th e changes over the past twelve 
months in various commercial real estate loan te rms.  This year’s responses indicate that at both 
domestic and foreign institutions most terms on such  loans were little changed, on net, over the 
past year.  However, almost 60 percent of domes tic respondents, on balance, reported that they 
had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost  of funds, while small net fractions of foreign 
respondents noted that they had reduced debt service coverage ratios and increased maximum 
loan sizes.  Nearly all domestic banks and a ll foreign institutions that had eased terms on 
commercial real estate loans over the past twel ve months cited more-aggressive competition from 
other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  
Household Lending 
On balance, almost one-fifth of domestic banks reported that they had tightened credit standards 
on residential mortgage loans over the past three months, the highest net fraction posted since the 
early 1990s.  About 40 percent of domestic institu tions—a somewhat smaller net fraction than in 
the October survey—indicated that demand for such  loans had weakened over the previous three 
months.     Domestic respondents reported that their willi ngness to make consumer installment loans was 
little changed in the January survey.  Similarly,  standards and terms on credit card and non-credit-
card consumer loans had reportedl y changed little, on balance, over the previous three months.  
About one-third of domestic institutions indicated  that they had experienced weaker demand for 
consumer loans, a slightly smaller net pe rcentage than in the previous survey. 
 A set of special questions asked domestic banks  about the effects of the bankruptcy reform 
legislation that took effect on October 17, 2005.  Virtually all domestic respondents reported that 
they had not changed their lending policies for cred it card loans in response to the reforms.  Two 
institutions indicated that they had tightened cr edit standards for approving applications for credit 
card loans.  One-fourth of domestic instituti ons indicated that, after accounting for changes in 
their lending standards and terms, they anticipat e that their charge-offs on credit card loans will 
be lower in the long term as a result of the reforms.   
Special Questions on the Outlook for Loan Quality in 2007 
A final set of special questions queried banks about their outlook for delinquencies and charge-
offs on their loans to businesses and households  in 2007 under the assumption that economic 
activity will progress in line with consensus forecast s.  Overall, the responses suggest that banks 
expect a deterioration in loan quality this year.  About 45 percent of domestic respondents, on net, 
reported that they expect the quality of th eir loans to businesses—including both C&I and 
commercial real estate loans—to deteriorate somewh at.  At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign 
III-A-6 
banks, the net fraction of respondents that expect ed a decline in the credit quality of loans to 
businesses was somewhat smaller—roughly 30 percent.  Almost 40 percent of domestic institutions, on balance, indicated that they antic ipate that the quality of both credit card and non-
credit-card consumer loans will deteriorate in  2007.  A similar net fraction of domestic 
respondents reported that they expect the quality of their traditional residential mortgages to 
decline.  One-half of domestic ba nks, on net, reported that they expect a worsening of the quality 
of their nontraditional residential mortgage loan s this year; a few institutions noted that they 
anticipate that the quality of such loans will deteri orate substantially in 2 007.  Banks were asked 
the same set of special questions about their ou tlook for loan quality in the January 2006 survey. 
A year ago, the net fraction of institutions that anticipated some deterioration in credit quality was 
notably smaller for loans to both businesses and households.

The U.S. international trade deficit na rrowed from $64.3 billion in September to 
$58.8 billion in October and edged down fu rther to $58.2 billion in November.  The 
November deficit was the smallest since July  2005.  The contraction of the deficit in 
October primarily reflected a decline in both the price and volume of oil imports, whereas 
the narrowing in November occurred as expor t growth outpaced a modest increase in 
non-oil imports and imports of oil remained flat.

The value of exports of goods and services  increased 0.9 percent in November following 
a 0.3 percent increase in October.  The N ovember increase was split between higher 
exports of services and exports of goods, wh ereas the October incr ease reflected higher 
exports of services, as exports of goods fe ll slightly during the month.  Exports in 
November were boosted by a large jump in e xports of aircraft, a nd were also supported 
by a rise in exports of automotive products a nd consumer goods.  In contrast, exports of 
industrial supplies fell back in  November, depressed in part  by the continued retreat of 
exports of fuel oil following a surge in September.

The average value of exports in October a nd November increased 7.4 percent (a.r.) from 
the third quarter.  Expo rts of aircraft and services exhibited particular strength.  In 
contrast, exports of automotive products fell ba ck from their elevated  third-quarter level. 
 
The value of imported goods and services rose 0.3 percent in November after falling 
2.7 percent in October.  The increase in N ovember reflected higher imports of both goods 
and services, whereas the decline in Oc tober occurred as lower imports of goods, 
especially oil, more than offset a slight increase in imports of services.  Imports in 
November increased in most major categor ies with the exception of non-oil industrial 
supplies, which recorded a large decline.  Imports of consumer goods were particularly robust in November. 
 
The average value of imports in October a nd November fell 12.2 percent (a.r.) from the 
third quarter.  The decline primarily refl ects a fall in both the volume and price of 
imported oil.  Additionally, imports of non-oil industrial suppli es, capital goods, and 
automotive products also fell, offsetting a str ong increase in imports of consumer goods. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In December, import prices of  non-oil goods and core goods rose 
0.4 and 0.2 percent, respectively.  Prices for non-fuel i ndustrial supplie s increased 
0.5 percent in December, as higher prices for metals were partly offset by falling prices for building materials.  Food prices were up 0.6 percent in December.  In contrast, prices 
for imported finished goods edged up onl y 0.1 percent while prices for imported 
computers fell 0.2 percent, and prices for semiconductors fell 0.3 percent. 
 
The average level of core import prices in th e fourth quarter was 1½ percent (a.r.) above 
the third-quarter average, as prices increased  in all major sub-categories.  Prices for 
material-intensive goods were up 3¾ percent, while prices fo r finished goods increased 
less than 1 percent. 
 
Oil.  After falling more than 20 percent over the previous three months, the BLS price 
index of imported oil rose 4.8 percent in December.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crud e oil rose to a similar extent in December and averaged $62 per 
barrel for the month.  Thus far in January, however, the spot price of WTI has fallen

sharply to close at $53.90 per barrel on January 23.  The plunge in oil prices appears to 
reflect reduced oil demand, which largel y has been caused by above-average 
temperatures in much of the northern he misphere.  Additionally, although violence 
continues to disrupt oil produc tion in Iraq and Nigeria, mark et participants may have 
reevaluated the willingness of Saudi Arabia to defend elevated oil prices. 
 
Exports.   In December, prices of U.S. exports of total goods and core goods rose 0.7 and 
0.8 percent, respectively.  Both numbers are up strongly for the second consecutive 
month, after falling in both of the prior two months.  The December increase was driven 
by higher prices for fuels, building materials,  and agricultura l products.  Export prices for 
finished goods increased only 0.2 percent in December.  Prices of exported computers 
fell 0.5 percent, and prices of exported semiconductors fell 0.3 percent. 
 
The average level of core export prices in th e fourth quarter was a bout 1 percent (a.r.) 
above the third-quarter average,  as a 1¾ percent increase in the prices of finished goods 
was partly offset by a ¼ percent decline in th e prices of material-i ntensive goods.  Within 
material-intensive goods, a 5 percent dec line in export prices for nonagricultural 
industrial supplies r oughly offset a 20 percent increase in prices for agricultural exports. 
 
U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $902 b illion (a.r.) in the third quarter of 2006, 
$34 billion wider than in the second quarter  (revised).  The tr ade deficit widened by 
$29 billion, as increased imports outpaced in creased exports.  These increases were 
observed in all major import and export cate gories, with the exception of a decline in 
imports of automotive vehicles and parts.  Ther e was only a slight chan ge in net unilateral 
transfers to foreigners. 
 
The investment income balance was negative $9 billion (a.r.) in the third quarter, and the 
second-quarter investment income balance was revised upward by $8 billion to negative 
$2 billion.  Although interest, di vidend, and direct investment income receipts increased 
in the third quarter, there were even larger increases in payments.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
The financial flows associated with the curr ent account are presente d in the Summ ary of 
U.S. International Transactions table.  Recorded net private financial inflows moved up 
to $96 billion in the third quarter but rema ined well below the pace recorded in 2005.  
Measured official financial inflows also increa sed slightly to $80 billion.  In sum, third-
quarter recorded net financial inflows increased by a larger amount than did the recorded 
current account.  As a result the statistical discrepancy narrowed, measuring $50 billion 
for the quarter, but remained large and positive for the third consecutive quarter.  This positive statistical discrepa ncy indicates some combination of under-recorded net 
financial inflows or over-r ecorded net imports of goods  and services and other 
transactions measured in th e current account balance. 
 U.S. direct investment abroad in the third qu arter (lin
 e 6) remained near its trend level on 
continued strength in reinvest ed earnings.  Foreign direct  investment flows into the 
United States (line 7) also remained robust.  With respect to more recent monthly data, foreign official flows into the United States were relatively weak in Nove
mber, totaling onl y $13 billion (line 1).  As shown in the top 
left panel of the Foreign Of ficial Financial Flows chart, however, the 2006 pace of 
foreign official inflows exceeded the 2005 pace.

Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securiti es in creased in November (line 4), the result 
of stronger foreign appetite for U.S. debt s ecurities.  Purchases of Treasury securities 
(line 4a) were up sharply, and purchases of  corporate bonds (line 4c) reached a record 
level in November as foreign investors responded to strong issuance of U.S. corporate debt abroad.  Increased demand for U.S. debt  was partially offset by an easing in demand 
for U.S. equities (line 4d).  As shown in th e top left panel of the Private Securities Flows 
chart, the six-month average of  total net private foreign pur chases of U.S. securities 
approached the high recorded earlier in 2006.  Year-to-date, total net private purchases 
are running at about the pace of 2005, with demand having shifted away from Treasuries and toward corporate bonds.    U.S. private acquisitions of foreign securities in November (line 5 of the table and the bottom
 panels of the chart on Private Securitie s Flows) reached a record level as demand 
for both foreign stocks and bonds increase d.  Although the bulk of foreign bonds were 
transacted through the U.K. fi nancial center, there were also significant net purchases 
related to bond issuance by counterparties in Brazil and Australia.  As with foreign bonds, U.S. investors purchased foreign st ocks primarily through the U.K financial 
center.  As shown on the chart, the six-mont h average of U.S. private acquisitions of 
foreign securities has remained in a narrow, elevated range throughout 2006. 
 The trend of net inflows recorded by the banki ng sector (line 3) cont inued in Novem
 ber.  
Although these flows are typically  volatile, there were net banking inflows in each of the 
first three quarters of 2006 a nd in the first two months of the fourth quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
Over the intermeeting period, the major currenc ies index of the dollar’s exchange value 
rose 2¼ percent on net.  The appreciation of the dollar was linked to several releases of 
U.S. economic data, including the stronger-than-expected December reports on 
employment and retail sales, several lower-tha n-expected weekly initial jobless claims 
reports, and a lower-than-expected merchandis e trade deficit for November.  Relative 
changes in expectations for the near-term m onetary policy in the United States and in 
most major foreign countries also favored th e dollar.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar 
appreciated 3¾ percent agains t the yen, 2¼ percent against the Canadian dollar, and 
2 percent against the euro, but it depreciated ¼ percen t against sterling.  The dollar’s 
appreciation against the yen was supporte d by the scaling back by some market 
participants of their expectat ions for a near-term rate hike  by the Bank of Japan.  Indeed, 
the Bank of Japan did not change its po licy stance at its meeting on January 18, 
surprising some market participants.  In cont rast, the dollar’s deprec iation against sterling 
was tied to the surprise 25-basis-point hi ke by the Bank of England on January 11.  The 
option-implied volatility of the euro-dollar a nd dollar-yen exchange ra tes fluctuated little 
and remained close to hi storically low levels. 
 
Headline equity indexes rose 2½ to 4 percent in Europe and about 6 percent in Japan.  
Perhaps these increases were supported by declin es in energy prices.  Ten-year nominal 
sovereign yields rose 25 to 30 basis poin ts in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, 
and the United States, but were little cha nged on net in Japan.  Long-term inflation 
breakeven rates, measured as the differe nce between nominal and inflation-indexed 
ten-year sovereign yields, were little cha nged on net in the major foreign countries.  
Realized volatilities on head line equity indexes and ten- year bond remained low during 
the intermeeting period.   
 
The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value ag ainst the currencies of our other important 
trading partners was unchanged on balance over the intermeeting period.  The dollar 
depreciated 1 percent against the Brazilian real, but it appreciated 1 percent against the 
Mexican peso and also appreciated somewhat  against the currenci es of several East-
Asian emerging market economies.  The dollar depreciated ¾ percent against the Chinese 
renminbi.  EMBI+ spreads declined 12 and 25 basis points in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, over the intermeeting period.  Th e overall EMBI+ spread and the spread on 
the Brazilian EMBI+ subindex both declined to new all-time lows late in the intermeeting 
IV-14 
period, and the spread on the Mexican EM BI+ subindex fluctuated around 100 basis 
points, near its all-time low. 
 Share price indexes in most major emerging m
 arket economies rose modestly over the 
intermeeting period, but they exhibited great  volatility in Thailand, Venezuela, and 
China.  Thai financial asset prices were volatile over the intermeeting period in reaction 
to several policy announcements (e.g., discourag ing capital inflows, encouraging capital 
outflows, and reducing the policy interest ra te) designed to stem the recent currency 
appreciation.  Several bombings in Bangkok on New Year’s Eve also imparted volatility to asset prices.  Asset pri ces in other major East Asia n countries reacted, but only 
temporarily, to the developments in Thailand.  On net, the Thai stock market index declined 11 percent over the period, and the Th ai baht appreciated ½ percent against the 
dollar.  Venezuela’s stock market index wa s volatile over the period, dropping almost 19 
percent following announcements from President Chavez that he plans to accelerate his “socialist revolution” by seeking increased powers fr om Congress, nationalizing 
companies in the utilities, telecommunications, and energy sectors, and stripping the 
central bank of its statutory autonomy.  Venezuela’s stock index, however, rebounded 
subsequently, and on net it declined about 5 percent over the period.  In contrast, the 
Shanghai equity market index rose 34 percen t, outperforming all other countries’ equity 
markets.  This surge did not appear to be linked to news about economic fundamentals.  
The Korean authorities announced new measures to liberalize cap ital outflows.  On net, 
the Korean stock market index rose ½ per cent over the period, and the Korean won 
depreciated 1½ percent against the dollar.

during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
After expanding moderately in the third quarter, overall economic activity in the 
advanced foreign economies appears to have ac celerated in the fourth quarter, supported 
by a firming of domestic demand and strong employment gains.  In Japan, private 
consumption seems to have rebounded after co ntracting in the third quarter.  Economic 
growth is continuing at a solid pace in th e euro area, with lower unemployment boosting 
consumer sentiment.  In the United Kingdom,  the expansion is accelerating, led by an 
apparent pick up in consumption growth.  Output growth seems to have firmed in Canada 
but likely remains below trend. 
 
Inflation continued to be c ontained in most advanced foreign economies in November 
and December, helped by lower fuel prices.  The United Kingdom was the major exception, with CPI inflation reaching 3 percent in December, its highest level in twelve 
years.  The Bank of England raised its inte rest rate ¼ percenta ge point in January. 
 
In Japan , recent indicators point to a re bound in consumption spending and an 
acceleration of production in th e fourth quarter.  Following a 4.1 percent increase in 
October, real household expenditures rose 0.5 percent in November.  Retail sales were 
flat in November after dec lining 0.2 percent in October.  Industrial production rose 
0.8 percent in November, driven by increas ed production of transport equipment, 
petroleum products, and electronics, while sh ipments were up 1.8 percent.  Machinery 
orders increased 3.8 percent in November and were 0.7 percent higher th an a year earlier.  
Housing starts also jumped 3.7 percent in November, following more moderate increases 
in the previous two months.  The Bank of Japa n's measure of real exports rose 2.6 percent 
in November, while real impor ts contracted 4 percent. 
 
The labor market continued to improve in  November, as the economy added seventy 
thousand new jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent.  The job-offers-to-applicants ratio remained at the elevated  level of 1.06.  Nevertheless, gross earnings, 
which include bonuses, were 0.3 percen t lower than a year earlier.

An increase in the December Tankan survey offered further evidence that the economy 
continues to firm.  Both manufacturing a nd non-manufacturing firms reported improved 
conditions, and the headline index for large ma nufacturers reached its highest level in two 
years.  Firms revised their e xpectations of capital spending du ring the current fiscal year 
(April 2006 through March 2007) up from 8.4 per cent to 10.5 percent, as small firms 
substantially increased their pl anned investment.  Sales and profit expectations for this 
fiscal year were both revised up and the num ber of firms reporting labor shortages also 
rose, indicating that strong labor market conditions should continue. 
 
Recent indicators point to w eak inflationary pressures.  The headline consumer price 
index fell 0.1 percent in November, reflecting a drop in food prices , but was 0.3 percent 
higher than a year earlier.  Core CPI infl ation (excluding fresh f ood only) was flat in 
November but rose 0.2 percent from a year ea rlier.  However, excluding both fresh food 
and energy, consumer prices fell 0.2 percent over the preceding year.  The twelve-month 
rate of wholesale price inflation continued to moderate in December, falling 
0.2 percentage point to 2.5 percent. 
 
Recent indicators for the euro area  generally have remained robust, with consumer 
spending appearing to have taken over the lead in driving euro-area growth.  The 
European Commission survey of euro-area economic sentiment edged down in December, but remained near the cyclical peak reached in October.  Industrial and 
construction confidence declined slightl y, but consumer confidence continued to 
increase.  Household spending picked up in November, with the volume of euro-area retail sales rising 0.3 percent from the previous month and 1.3 percent from a year earlier.  
In December, French households’ consump tion of manufactured goods rose 1.3 percent 
on a monthly basis, far surpassing economists'  consensus forecast of a 0.2 percent gain. 
 
The euro-area purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing edged down in December 
to 56.5 but remained near its recent high.  The euro-area purchasing managers’ index for 
services also edged down in December, to 57.2. 
 
Germany’s economic performance improved not ably over the past year.  The German 
IFO Business Climate Index continued to surp rise on the upside, posting an all-time high 
of 108.7 in December.  German industrial production bounced back with a 1.8 percent 
increase in November.  In contrast, Fren ch industrial production excluding construction 
edged down in November  from the previous month.

In November, the euro-area unemployment rate declined to 7.6 percent, down nearly a 
percentage point over the past year and the lo west rate since Eurost at began measuring it 
in 1993.  In Germany, the national measure of  the unemployment rate fell to 9.8 percent 
in December, down from 11.3 percent a year ea rlier.  German employment rose for the 
ninth straight month in November and had increased more than 1 percent over the 
preceding twelve months. 
 
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation remained at 1.9 percent in 
December, just below the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling.  Core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, remained at 1.6 percent in November.  The ECB kept its policy rate unchanged at its January meeting and signaled that its next rate hike may not occur until March.  ECB policymakers continued to expres s concern over rapid growth in the money 
supply.  In November, the twel ve-month percentage change of euro-area M3 rose to 
9.3 percent in November from 8.5 percent in  October, well above the ECB’s reference 
value of 4.5 percent. 
 
In the United Kingdom , the chained volume measure of GDP grew 3.4 percent (a.r.) in 
the fourth quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  The service sector expanded by 4.4 percent, led by a rebound in the output of  the distribution, hot els and restaurants 
sector, which grew 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared with 0.7 percent a quarter 
earlier.  Output growth in the transport, storage and communication industries was also 
solid, at 6 percent.  By contrast, the output of production industries  declined 1.2 percent, 
reversing the gains over th e previous two quarters. 
 
Recent economic indicators point to conti nued economic expansion supported by robust 
investment and a firming of consumption.  In December, business confidence was buoyant, and the PMI for servi ces increased for a fourth consecutive month, reaching its 
highest value since June 1997.  The PMI for manufacturing edged down to 51.9 but 
continues to indicate expansion.  Retail sale s grew 1.1 percent in December as a result of 
strong Christmas-time sales in predominantly non-food stores.  Consumer confidence slid further, however, as households worried about the general ec onomic situation, but 
remains slightly above its third-quarter av erage.  Halifax and Nationwide, two major 
British lenders, reported twelve-month house price increases of 8.4 and 10.5 percent in 
December, respectively.

The Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.5 percent in 
November as employment growth continued to  be strong.  The claimant count measure of 
the unemployment rate was 3 percent in December, a level unchanged since March. 
 
The twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflati on climbed to 3 percent in December.  The 
index was pushed up mainly by the introduc tion of new fuel duties on December 6, 
increased household and furniture prices, and strong base effects associated with a 
relatively large fall in the price of gasoline tw elve months earlier.  Producers’ input prices 
rose 2 percent in the year to December, the smallest twelve-month increase since March 2004.  Average earnings growth, at 4.1 percent in November, remained contained. 
 
On January 11, the Monetary Policy Committ ee raised the official rate paid on 
commercial bank reserves 25 basis points to 5¼ percent.  The Committee justified its 
decision by citing a thin marg in of spare capacity in th e economy, a likely rise of 
inflation further above the targ et in the near term, and an increase in upside risks to 
inflation relative to its November Inflation Report. 
 
Canadian real GDP by industry fell 0.2 percent (a.r.) in October, with ou tput declining in 
both the goods-producing and service sect ors.  Continuing its year-long trend, 
manufacturing output declined, led by significant cutbacks in auto production.  Output of 
the retail sector also receded in October, with declines register ed across most trade 
groups.  Activity in the construction sector  rose, however; increased engineering and 
repair work offset declines in both residential and non-residential c onstruction.  A bright 
spot was the energy sector, in which output adva nced briskly, led in particular by gains in 
the production and distribution of natural gas, electricity production, and refinery output. 
 
Other indicators for the fourth quarter also have been more upbeat.  After falling nearly 
five percent in the third quarter, housing starts edged up in  the fourth quarter.  The 
nominal merchandise trade balance widened in November, keeping the fourth-quarter 
trade surplus on track to increase after th ree straight quarters of declines.  The 
manufacturing sector also re bounded smartly in November, with shipments, new orders, 
and unfilled orders all rising sharply, led espe cially by the motor vehicle sector.  After 
contracting in October, retail sales expanded in November, although gains were 
concentrated in the auto sector.  The com posite index of leading indicators advanced 
again in December after surging in November.

The labor market also posted another strong a dvance in the fourth quarter.  In December, 
total employment recorded another large gain, putting fourth-quarter job gains about four 
times larger than in the third quarter.  Fu ll-time employment, after falling a bit in 
November, resumed its strong year-long climb.  The unemployment rate edged down to 
6.1 percent, matching a thirty-two-year low also reached in May and June. 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation moved up to 1.6 percent in December, 
after being depressed the previous few months due to rapidl y-falling gasoline prices.  The 
twelve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components 
and indirect taxes, moved down to 2 percent in December from 2.2 percent in November.  Despite easing over the past two months, co re prices inflation accelerated during the 
second half of 2006, driven largely by a rise  in homeowners’ replacement costs, which 
are estimated using, among other data, prices for new homes.  The twelve-month rate of 
new home price inflation remained elevated at 11 percent in November, about where it 
had been since August.  These increases were  sustained largely by the western provinces, 
especially the oil-produci ng province of Alberta.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data for some emerging Asian econom ies – particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Korea, and India – point to some moderation in the pace of growth.  However, Chinese 
economic activity seems to be picking up from its recent slowdown, and the ASEAN 
region appears to have expanded at a solid pace in recent months.  In Latin America, Mexican indicators signal a slowdown in f ourth-quarter growth; however, Brazilian 
activity seems to be accelerating.  In Ven ezuela, President Chavez recently announced 
the nationalization of some major companies.   Falling oil prices led to a reduction in 
inflation in several countries , but food price inflation in  some economies exerted an 
offsetting effect. 
 
In China, the economic slowdown experienced duri ng the third quarter continued into 
the early part of the fourth, but activity app ears to have picked up again more recently.  
After slowing to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, industrial pr oduction declined in October 
but jumped 2.1 percent in November.  Sim ilarly, twelve-month fixed asset investment 
growth slowed to 16 percent in October but increased to 24 percent in November.  The 
effects of last year’s administrative measures to cool the economy we re also reflected in 
growth of imports, which decreased sharply in the fourth quarter.  Export growth also 
slowed, but not as much.  For 2006 as a whole,  the growth rate of exports (27 percent) 
again exceeded the growth rate of imports (20 percent), resulting in an increase in the 
trade surplus to $178 billion from $102 billion in 2005. 
 
Driven by an increase in volatile food pri ces, consumer prices increased 2 percent over 
the twelve months ended in November comp ared with 1½ percent over the comparable 
period ending in October.  However, underlying pressures on non-f ood prices continued 
to be fairly benign.  In early January, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) raised reserve 
requirement for banks another 50 basis points, th e fourth such increase since June.  This 
takes the required reserve ratio for large banks to 9.5 percent.  The move was not a 
surprise, as the PBOC had earli er indicated its intention to use reserve requirements to a 
greater extent as a monetary polic y tool to temper credit growth.

In Hong Kong, output growth in the third quarter surged, supported by external demand, 
after little change in the s econd.  In October and November, the trade deficit widened, 
which may be a sign that the contribution of net exports to output growth moderated in 
the fourth quarter, an important developm ent in this entrepôt economy.  Twelve-month 
inflation edged up in November, in part  reflecting higher food price inflation.

In Taiwan , third-quarter real GDP growth was a bout 8 percent, boosted mainly by strong 
investment.  The fourth-quarter trade surplus widened slightly, and export orders 
increased in October and November, partic ularly for high-tech products.  However, 
industrial production in the fourth quarter wa s 1 percent below its third-quarter level, 
partly reflecting some cooling in the constr uction sector.  Twelve-month inflation reached 
IV-32 
positive territory in November and continued increasing in December, partly reflecting 
food price increases.

In Korea , incoming data suggest further moderate  growth.  Industrial production dropped 
back some in November after strong perfor mance in previous months.  Consumer and 
business confidence edged down in December, but retail sales for Oc tober and November 
were strong.  The merchandise trade balance surged in November, reflecting a sharp 
pick-up in exports, although evidence points to some slowing in December.  Consumer 
price inflation has declined recently, as has the unemployment rate.  In mid-January, the 
Finance Ministry loosened se veral restrictions on overseas investment by Koreans, in 
hopes of reducing upward pressure on the won.  Also in January, the government 
announced stricter loan standards and ceili ngs on the prices of new homes, in its 
continuing effort to control house prices.

Indian  economic indicators point to  some moderation in the f ourth quarter from a strong 
third-quarter pace.  Average industrial production in October and November was up 1 percent from the third-quarter level, a nd the December Purchasing Managers’ Index fell 
to its lowest level in five months.  The tr ade balance continued to deteriorate into the 
fourth quarter.  Twelve-month inflation of the closely watched wholesale price index 
remained near 5½ percent in December, despite falling oil prices.

Incoming data for the ASEAN  region suggest that economic activity expanded at a solid 
pace in the fourth quarter.  In Singapore, th e advance unofficial estimate indicates that 
real GDP rose 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter .  Recent strong readings for the Singapore 
electronics PMI signal a conti nued expansion of ac tivity going forward.  Elsewhere in the 
region, industrial production wa s down in October, but rebounded in November in 
Malaysia and Thailand, and trade balances were generally strong. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation across the region fell below third-quarter levels, 
due in part to lower energy prices and, in some countries, unwinding of previous food 
price increases.  Citi ng the moderation in inflation, cen tral banks in Indonesia and 
Thailand eased monetary policy.  The Bank of Thailand lowered its target interest rate 
25 basis points on January 17.  Bank Indonesi a cut rates 50 basis points in early 
December and again by 25 basis points in early January, bringing the cumulative 
decrease to 300 basis points  since the easing phase bega n in May of last year. 
 
The last month has been a volatile one for Thailand.  On December 18, Thailand 
announced a 30-percent unremunerated reserv e requirement on foreign currency capital 
inflows.  The following day, the stock market plunged 16 percent to its lowest level in 
several years and bond yields spiked, forcing the authorities to pa rtially rescind the 
measure.  On January 16, the government announced measures to liberalize capital outflows in an effort to stem the apprecia tion of the local currency.  Separately, on New 
Year's Day, multiple bombings took place across Bangkok, and on January 9, the Thai authorities approved a revision to the Foreign Business Act that will cap to 50 percent the 
nominal shares and voting rights foreign en tities can hold in a local subsidiary.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to a slowdow n in the pace of economic growth.  
Industrial production contracted 0.6 percent in October, mainly as a result of the cooling 
of U.S. demand for Mexican manufacturing e xports, but recovered in November on the 
back of continued strength in  the construction sector.  More broadly, the index of overall 
economic activity (a monthly proxy for GDP) tic ked up in October, due to recovery in 
agricultural production.  Twelve-month headline  inflation was 4 percent in December, the 
fourth consecutive month where inflation was at or above the upper limit of the central 
bank’s 2-to-4 percent inflation target range.  The higher-than -expected inflation readings 
in recent months were the result of some food price increases, mainly for tomatoes and 
corn tortillas; however, these increases are seen as temporary, and monetary policy has 
remained unchanged.

In Brazil , incoming data are somewhat mixed but on net point to a pickup in activity in 
the fourth quarter.  In November, industr ial production was up 0.8 percent, boosted by 
strong performance in oil production and refini ng, and retail sales were strong.  However, 
December vehicle sales and production were down.  The trade balance for 2006 reached a 
record high, $46 billion, boosted by higher pr ices for export commodities.  Twelve-
month consumer price inflation ended the ye ar at about 3 percent, well below the 
IV-42 
4.5 percent mid-point of the government’s inflation target range and the lowest level 
since the inflation targeting regime was adopted in 1999.

In Argentina,  the index of economic activity (a  monthly proxy of GDP) through 
November suggests that growth continued to be strong in the fourth quarter.  Industrial 
production in October and November on averag e was 2 percent above its third-quarter 
level, a notable acceleration from the pace re gistered in the previous quarter.  Twelve-
month inflation ended 2006 in the singl e digits, down from 2005.  The food and 
beverages sector was responsible for about one-t hird of the 2006 infla tion rate, the largest 
contribution of any sector; how ever, its contribution also fe ll the most relative to the 
previous year, explaining the bulk of the ove rall reduction in inflation.  The government's 
price agreements with representatives from several food sectors in early 2006 may partly 
explain the reduction.  Recently, the government has suggested that some of those price agreements may be allowed to expire in 2007.

In Venezuela , President Chavez took office for a new six-year term on January 8, and 
over that week he made a number of announcem ents to further consolidate power.  He 
announced that the government will nationalize the country’s largest telecommunications 
company, CANTV, as well as the electricity co mpanies that had been privatized in the 
1990s.  Chavez also suggested that the governme nt may take a majority stake in the oil 
operations in the Orinoco Basin currently controlled by foreign companies, asked the national congress to change the business code to “regulate profits,” and refused to renew 
a broadcasting license to a local television network that had been  sympathetic to the 
opposition.  Chavez also proposed legislation th at would formally strip the central bank 
of its autonomy, although th e central bank has had little de facto  autonomy since Chavez 
came to power in 1999. 
 
Monetary and fiscal policies have been very expansionary and, as a result, inflation has 
been persistently high, ending 2006 at 17 percen t.  The Chavez government is expected to 
transfer about $7 billion of the central bank’s $40 billion in international reserves to a 
government development bank.

In Turkey , economic activity slowed during the third quarter.  Real GDP grew 
3.4 percent while industrial pr oduction fell 2.9 percent.  Industrial production surged in 
November, however, and falling commodity pri ces have contributed to improvements in 
the trade balance.  Despite monetary tight ening and slowing economic growth, inflation 
remained high, with twelve-month consumer price inflation at 9.7 percent in 2006.  EU 
accession talks have been suspended until fu rther progress is made with Cyprus.

In South Africa , recent indicators suggest that fourth-quarter non-gold mining output 
rose, but manufacturing growth was weak.  Consumer price inflation was steady at 
5 percent in the fourth quarte r, although inflationary pres sures persist.  The current 
account deficit was 6 percent of GDP in the th ird quarter, driven by soaring imports.  The 
South African rand strengthened in November and December after its  rapid depreciation 
in the second and third quarters of 2006, but weakened again in recent weeks.
