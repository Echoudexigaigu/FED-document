Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Economic activity appears to be expanding at  a modest pace this  quarter.  Output 
continues to be damped by declining construction activity as homebuilders attempt to reduce their inventories of unsold homes.  In  addition, business investment has softened 
considerably over the past several months , with weakness especi ally noticeable for 
equipment used in the constr uction and motor vehicle indus tries.  Manufacturing output 
also has been held down by developments in  these two industries and by emerging signs 
of softness in the production of business equi pment.  But there have been favorable 
developments as well.  Demand for housing app ears to have stabilized, at least for the 
time being, and inventories of light motor vehi cles have declined close to the levels 
desired by firms.  Moreover, consumer spendi ng has increased appreciably since late last 
year, and labor demand continues to expand—a lbeit less rapidly than the average pace 
last year.  Total PCE inflation has decelerated  over the past year because of declining 
energy prices, but the most recent twelve-mont h change in core PCE prices to January 
was slightly higher than at  the same time last year. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand appears to have moderated at the beginning of the year.  Private nonfarm 
payroll employment increased at an aver age pace of 95,000 per month in the first two 
months of the year, about 70,000 below th e average in the second half of 2006.
1  In 
February, private nonfarm payroll employme nt increased only 58,000, as severe winter 
weather likely contributed to a 62,000 decline in constructio n employment.  Elsewhere, 
manufacturing employment fell again last month, but employment in services-producing 
sectors increased 129,000.  Although employme nt in goods-producing industries has 
decelerated noticeably since the first half of  last year, employment gains in services-
producing sectors have remained strong.    In February, the average workweek of pr oduction or nonsupervisory workers on private 
nonfarm payrolls ticked down 0.1 hour, to 33.7 hours, likely held down by bad weather; 
indeed, in the household survey the number of individuals who reported working part 
time because of bad weather spiked up last month.  The decline in the workweek pushed 
aggregate hours down 0.3 percent in Februa ry, and the February level of hours stood 
0.1 percent below the four th-quarter average. 
 
                                                
 
1 The January employment report included the annual benchmark revision to the payroll survey.  The 
benchmark revision added 68,000 to the average monthly change in nonfarm payroll employment from 
April 2005 to March 2006, raising it to 237,000.  From April 2006 to December 2006, the average monthly 
change in nonfarm payroll employment was revised up 22,000, to 168,000.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in 
February to 4.5 percent—equal to the averag e level in the fourth quarter—and the labor 
force participation rate dec lined 0.1 percentage point, to  66.2 percent—a bit below the 
average level in the fourth qua rter.  Consistent with the a pparent moderation in payroll 
employment, the number of job losers unempl oyed for less than 5 w eeks as a percent of 
employment—a proxy for the layoff rate—has ri sen somewhat in recent months, and, as 
a result, the total number of unempl oyed job losers has also crept up. 
 Other indicators of labor demand have been  mixed.  The four-week moving average of 
initial claims for unemployment insurance ha s moved up recently and stood at 339,000 in 
the week ending March 3, slight ly above the high end of the range seen over the past 
year.  In addition, layoff announcements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and 
Christmas, increased in February, although the level remained relatively low.  Moreover, 
firms’ hiring plans—as measured by Manpower and the National Federation of 
Independent Businesses (NFIB)—have edged down  recently.  In contrast, job openings, 
as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , remained at a high level through the end of 
January.      Measures of labor market tightness have ch anged relatively little, on net, recently.  
According to the NFIB, 25 percent of firms reported that they had a hard-to-fill position in February, a share about equal to the averag e level in the second half of last year.  
Although the Conference Board surv ey of consumers indicates that jobs have become a 
bit easier to find in recent months, th e number of individuals who remain on 
unemployment insurance rolls until their bene fits expire (the exhaustion rate) has 
changed little of late.    The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  Over th e past four quarters, output per hour increased 
1.5 percent by our estimate—½ percentage point below the pace recorded during the preceding four quarters.

2 These estimates reflect the BLS’s recent incorporation of the benchmark revision to nonfarm payroll 
employment into its estimates of nonfarm business productivity.  The benchmark revision resulted in 
downward revisions to productivity growth of about ½ percentage point over the four quarters of 2005 and 
¼ percentage point over the four quarters of 2006.

Industrial Production   
After a decline of ½ percent in January, the available data suggest that total industrial 
production (IP) rose solidly in February, in pa rt because of transitory factors.  Production 
last month was boosted by a temporary surge in  output at utilities, reflecting the sizable 
swing in temperatures from a moderately warm January to a cold February, and by a 
bounceback in motor vehicle assemblies from a steep decline in January.  Manufacturing 
output outside motor vehicles and parts appear s to have risen moderately in February 
after having fallen in January and in the fourth quarter of last year.  Capacity utilization 
in manufacturing, which stood 0.2 percenta ge point below its 1972-2006 average in 
January, likely rose in Februa ry, but remained a good bit belo w its recent peak in August 
of last year.3 
 Production cutbacks at motor vehi cle manufacturers and in ups tream industries related to 
construction and motor vehicles account for a substantial share of the weakness in IP 
during the past six months.  More recently, however, the softness has spread to some 
areas of business equipment and to some areas  of non-auto consumer goods.  Meanwhile,  
 
                                                
 
 3 The initial estimates of industrial capacity for 2007 were published last month.  Total industrial 
capacity is projected to rise 2.1 percent in 2007 after having expanded 2.4 percent in 2006.  Manufacturing 
capacity, which is estimated to increas e 2.4 percent this year, is also lik ely to decelerate re lative to 2006.  
Motor vehicle assembly plants at Ford and GM that are currently idled or slated to be idled have been removed from our capacity estimates and account for the slower rise in capacity this year.  Excluding motor 
vehicles and parts, manufacturing capacity is estimated to  increase slightly faster in 2007 than in 2006.  
Mining capacity is projected to increase 0.7 percent in 2007, about the same as in 2006, while capacity at utilities is expected to increase 1.3 percen t, rising more slowly than last year.

the output of commercial aircraft and of hi gh-tech products has continued to boost IP, 
though by less than it had in the middle of 2006.  The assembly rate for light motor vehicles—a fter having dropped to  an annual rate of 
9.9 million units in January—rose to a rate of 10.4 million units in February.  This 
rebound brought the February pace of assemblie s only back to the average rate over the 
second half of 2006—a period during which pr oducers had sharply curtailed output.  
Such low assembly rates have enabled au tomakers to continue to reduce dealer 
inventories relative to sales, which at the end of February stood at an estimated 65 days, 
roughly their preferred level.  Assemblies of me dium and heavy trucks declined further in 
February after having plunged about 20 percen t in January, reflecting payback for last 
year’s surge in demand ahead of EPA’s tighten ing of engine regulati ons at the beginning 
of this year.  Overall motor vehicle assemblie s are scheduled to rise somewhat in March 
and then rise sharply in the second quarter.    Output in high-technology industries appear s to have increased at a solid pace in 
February after four months in which producti on rose at a moderate rate.  Semiconductor 
production picked up in February after havi ng decelerated around the turn of the year 
across a wide variety of chip types.  Although inventories had risen re lative to sales for a 
broad group of chipmakers in the fourth quarter (the latest available da ta), a large share of 
that increase likely reflected stockbuildi ng in anticipation of the new Windows Vista 
operating system.  Thus, if Vi sta sales unfold as producers ex pect, the inventory situation 
is unlikely to hold back chip produc tion significantly in coming months. 
 In the computer sector, weekly data from the market-tracking fi rm NPD suggest that 
retail PC sales have surged since th e January 31 release of Windows Vista.
4  The output 
of computers for business use has been boos ted by rapid production gains for high-end 
servers, but demand for small servers has been relatively tepid.  Communications 
equipment output jumped in January after ha ving slowed in the fourth quarter.  The 
guidance for 2007 in recent quarterly reports for the major telecommunications service  
                                                 
 4 Early reports suggest that the mix of PC demand has shifted to higher-end machines in 
conjunction with the release of Vista.  At the same time, NPD reports that unit sales of the stand-alone 
version of Vista were 60 percent lower in the week afte r its release, compared with  sales of Windows XP in 
the week after its initial release in 2001.  The jump in  PC sales in the past few weeks, combined with the 
lackluster box sales of Vista, likely reflects the demands on computer processing power by the new 
operating system; these demands apparently are inducing  a larger share of consumers to purchase a new 
computer than did Windows XP.

providers (TSPs) points to continued capital spending gains this year, although somewhat 
smaller than those in the past two years. 
 Outside of energy, high-tech, and motor vehicl es and parts, industrial production fell 
sharply in the fourth quarter and appears to have fallen further, on balance, in the first 
two months of 2007.  In addition to the si gnificantly reduced de mand from industries 
related to homebuilding and motor vehicles, out put also has been damped by attempts to 
bring down elevated inventor ies in some upstream sector s such as wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, and fabricated metal products.  Moreover, the weakness appears to have seeped into the production of business equipment, such as industrial 
equipment and machine tools, as well as th e production of non-auto consumer durables, 
such as furniture and appliances.  However, with inventories of car s and light trucks now 
in better balance and assemblies scheduled to  rise in the second quarter, the drag on the 
output of industries upstream to motor vehicles should begin to diminish.  
 Near-term indicators of manuf acturing activity are generally favorable.  For example, the 
diffusion index for new orders from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) 
increased in February to a level consistent with moderate gains in  manufacturing output; 
the new orders indexes from the regional Federal Reserve surveys also turned up, on 
balance, in February.  In contrast, the three-month moving average of the staff’s series on real adjusted durable goods orders fell  ¼ percent in January; excluding high-tech 
industries, the measure fell ¾ percent, its sixth consecutive monthly decline.  
 
Light Motor Vehicles  
Although sales of light motor vehicles declin ed 200,000 units (annual rate) in February to 
a 16.5 million unit rate, this pace was still somewh at above that set in  the fourth quarter 
of last year.  Auto sales more than accounted  for February’s decline,  
.  In cont rast, sales of light trucks ticked up last 
month; the increase was concentrated at Ge neral Motors and Ford and helped the Big 
Three automakers boost their domestic market share for the first time since October of 
last year.   Although both the Reuters/University of Michig an index of car-buyi ng attitudes and the 
Conference Board measure of new car purch ase plans edged down in February, they 
remain within the ranges seen in recent months.  And, so far this month, sales by the 
major transplants suggest that total purchases of light motor vehicles in March will be 
close to February’s pace.  Accordingly, w ith demand well maintained, manufacturers’

pricing incentives seem likely to hold at a relatively low level in March, as they did in 
January and February.    
Consumer Spending   
Real PCE appears on track to rise  at a robust pace in the first quarter.  In part, the recent 
strength of spending reflected January’s jump in  sales of light motor vehicles as well as a 
weather-related surge in spendi ng on energy services.  Outside of these areas, the pace of 
real spending has moderated since the turn of the year.  In particular, nominal outlays for 
goods in the retail control group of stores, wh ich excludes purchases at outlets selling 
motor vehicles and building materials and s upplies, were about unchanged in February 
following a modest increase in January.  After factoring in our projection for consumer 
prices, we estimate that real PCE control was down a touch, on net, over the first two 
months of the year after bris k gains in the previous four months.  In contrast, real 
spending on non-energy services was solid in January, the most recent month for which 
data are available, boosted by r obust outlays for medical services. 
 The determinants of consumer spending have been mixed.  On the basis of unemployment insurance tax records, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) now 
estimates that real disposable personal income (DPI) rose at  an annual rate of 3¼ percent 
in the third quarter of last y ear, about 1 percentage point be low its earlier estimate.  The 
BEA estimates that real DPI picked up in the fourth quarter and then jumped in January.  
A number of special factors, such as the a nnual pay raise to federal civilian and military 
personnel and cost-of-living adju stments to Social Security benefits and other transfer 
programs, resulted in a step-up in the level of DP I in January that is e xpected to persist.  
In addition, the BEA estimated that bonus pa yments and stock option exercises were 
unusually large; with this temporary boost to income, the saving rate rose ¼ percentage 
point to negative 1¼ percent in January.  The latest readings on consumer sentiment have 
been generally favorable, and consumer spe nding has continued to draw support from the 
increases in household wealth th at have occurred over the past  two years.  However, the 
boost to consumer spending from wealth has likely been muted to some extent by the 
lagged effects of the upward trend in borro wing costs over the past few years.  In 
addition, the recent downturn in equity prices  along with indications of slower home 
price appreciation point to a modest decline in the wealth-income ratio for the household 
sector this quarter.

Housing  
Although data through January s uggest that housing demand ha s stabilized since last 
summer, construction of new homes continued to  decline as builders have tried to work 
off an elevated level of inventories.  In a ddition, an apparent tight ening of standards for 
nonprime borrowers in recent weeks w ill likely restrain home sales. 
 Single-family housing starts tumbled 11 percen t in January while starts in the much 
smaller multifamily sector dropped 25 percent.  These January declines followed weather-related spikes in ac tivity in December, when unseas onably warm weather likely 
allowed homebuilders to begin some constr uction projects earlier than planned.  
However, adjusted permit issuance in the single-family sector—a more reliable indicator of the underlying pace of construction activity—also moved down 6 percent in January, leaving the level of permits 5 percent below the fourth-quarter average.  
 In contrast to construction, home  sales have changed little, on net, in recent months.  In 
January, sales of existing single-family homes  rose 3½ percent to an annual rate of 
5.7 million units, their first noticeable increase since February 2006.
5  And although sales 
of new homes fell in January, this drop followed a surge in December; smoothing 
through these swings, the average pace of ne w home sales in December and January was 
in line with the pace since mid-2006.    A number of other indicators are also consistent with rela tively stable home sales through 
February.  The index of pending home sales— a predictor of future sales of existing 
homes—has changed little si nce July after having falle n sharply over the preceding 
twelve months; the four-week moving averag e of the index of mortgage purchase 
applications stopped trending down around the same time.  In addition, the 
Reuters/University of Michigan index of ho mebuying sentiment has risen a fair bit since 
September.  These improved conditions are, in  part, the resu lt of a decline in mortgage 
rates:  Despite an uptick in rates during the fi rst two months of the year, the average rate 
for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is curre ntly about 60 basis point s below the level of 
last July.  Average rates fo r one-year adjustable-rate mort gages are about 30 basis points 
lower.  However, rising delinquencies among nonprime borrowers and related financial  
 
                                                
 
5 New home sales are recorded at signing, while ex isting home sales are recorded when they close.  
Because of the typical lag between signing and closing, January’s incr ease in existing home sales may be 
related to December’s favorable weather.  However, weather patterns and existing home sales have no 
statistically reliable relationship.

difficulties for nonprime lenders in recent weeks have led to tighter lending standards in 
this sector, which will likely act as  a drag on home sales going forward. 
 The continued cuts in new residential construc tion in recent months  appear to have begun 
to make a dent in builders’ excess inventory of unsold new homes.  Still, months’ supply in January was about 30 percent above the hi gh end of the relative ly narrow range it 
occupied from 1997 to 2005.

 House-price appreciation has slowed markedly  in recent quarters, with some measures 
showing outright declines recently.  The pur chase-only version of the price index for 
existing homes calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
(OFHEO) increased 4.1 per cent over the four quarter s of 2006, continuing the 
deceleration that began in mid-2005.  The Ca se-Shiller home-price index—which uses a 
methodology similar to that for the OFHEO i ndex but covers only ten large U.S. cities—
was flat in the year ending in December.  Meanwhile, the average price of existing homes sold (which is available on a more timely basis than the other price measures) moved 
down in January to a level that was 3 percent below that of a year earlier.  However, 
because this measure does not adjust for cha nges in the average characteristics of homes 
sold, these declines might reflect a shift in the composition of sales away from higher-end 
homes.  For new homes, the average price on a constant-quality basis was 3½ percent 
above year-earlier levels in the fourth quart er, a slower rate of increase than in the 
preceding three years.  These figures may unders tate the actual deceleration in the cost to 
purchasers because homebuilders may have step ped up their use of a variety of non-price 
measures—such as granting more-favorable mo rtgage terms, paying closing costs, and 
including optional upgrades at no cost—to bolster sales and unload inventory.  
 Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software has w eakened of late.  In the fourth quarter, 
spending declined at an annual rate of 3½ pe rcent, and in January, nominal orders and 
shipments of nondefense capital goods excludin g aircraft posted widespread declines.  
Although much of the recent weakness has st emmed from the transportation equipment 
category, business investment in capital goods ou tside of transportati on and high-tech has

also softened considerably.  The slowdow n in equipment and software spending has 
exceeded that suggested by its fundamental determinants.  In particular, although the 
modest deceleration of busi ness output in the second ha lf of last year and the 
deterioration in many surveys of business condi tions are consistent with some slowing in 
spending growth, ongoing declines in the user cost for high-tech capital goods and the 
ample cash reserves held by firms remain supportive of investment.  Business outlays on transportation equipment fell noticeably in the fourth quarter.  In the 
first two months of this quarter, business purch ases of light vehicles have remained low, 
compared with the levels seen in recent y ears, and new orders a nd deliveries of medium 
and heavy trucks (classes 4 to 8) have plunged in recent months.
7  In contrast, data on 
shipments of domestic aircraft in January a nd February suggest that  business purchases of 
aircraft will rebound in the current quarter af ter declines in the past three quarters. 
 Real spending on high-tech equipment and softwa re was subpar last quarter, but available 
data for the current quarter point to a more  solid increase.  Although computer shipments 
fell in January, imports surged, suggesting risi ng domestic purchase s.  In addition, as 
noted earlier, computer sales appear to have  picked up markedly in February with the 
retail release of Windows Vista.  Real outla ys on communications equipment fell recently 
after rapid gains early last year , but spending growth is expect ed to resume fairly soon:  
TSPs provided guidance on capital expenditu res for 2007 consistent with continued 
spending growth.
8 
 Real spending on equipment other than high-te ch and transportation dropped 5 percent in 
the fourth quarter of last year, and new or ders and shipments at domestic manufacturers 
declined sharply in January, pointing to anothe r decline in the first quarter.  Orders and 
shipments of capital goods that are heavily used by the construction and motor vehicle 
industries (such as construction equipment a nd metalworking machinery) have been weak 
since the middle of last year and accounted fo r an outsized share of January’s declines.  
However, in the latest readings , the weakness has not been conf ined to just these types of 
equipment:  Categories such as industrial equipment; electromedical, measuring and 
controlling devices; and other elec trical equipment have softened as well.  On the bright 
side, the backlog of unfilled orders at ma nufacturers of nondefense capital goods other 
                                                
 
7 As mentioned earlier, the steep drop in truck demand reflects payback for last year’s surge of truck 
purchases ahead of new EPA regulations on emissions for diesel truck engines that went into effect in 
January. 
8 TSPs account for about one-fourth of total spending in this category.

than transportation and high-tech continued to increase in January, and the overall ISM 
manufacturing index, which we find helpful as  a near-term leading indicator of spending 
for this type of equipmen t, moved up in February. 
 
Nonresidential Construction   
Activity in the nonresidential construction sect or has moderated in recent months after 
having expanded at a brisk pace since late 2005.  However, the fundamentals in this 
sector remain solid and point to an improveme nt in the near term.  Vacancy rates in the 
industrial and office categories ha ve moved down steadily over th e past few years.  In the 
retail sector, the vacancy rate moved sideways  in the fourth quar ter after having moved 
up in the first half of the year; nevertheless, its level was still well below its peak from a 
few years ago.9  Furthermore, the architectural bill ings index—which is correlated with 
changes in nonresidential construction about  six months hence—has rebounded in recent 
months.  
Drilling and mining activity also  decelerated in the second ha lf of 2006 after having risen 
at an annual rate of nearly 15 percent in th e first half.  Moreover , during the first two 
months of 2007, the total number of drilling rigs in operation was flat.  This deceleration 
may partly reflect the net decline in energy prices in the second half of last year. 
 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory investme nt excluding motor vehicles in creased at an annual rate 
of $39 billion in the fourth quarter of last y ear, a slower pace of accumulation than in the 
previous two quarters.  The latest book-value data for ma nufacturing and trade excluding 
motor vehicles in January suggest that this slower pace of stockbuilding has continued into the current quarter.  Even so, businesses appear to have only partially addressed the 
inventory imbalances that have arisen recently.  The January book-value ratio of 
inventories to sales for manu facturing and trade (excludi ng motor vehicles) remained 
around the elevated level reached last Septem ber.  In addition, information from the 
staff’s flow-of-goods inventor y system suggests that—excluding motor vehicles and 
parts—months’ supply rose in January af ter having moved down in November and 
December.  In particular, months’ supply ro se in January for construction supplies, 
materials, and business equipment but decreased for consumer goods.  Moreover,

inventory levels as too high.   
 
Federal Government Sector  
The federal unified budget deficit narrowed fu rther in the early part  of this year as 
receipts continued to post unusually strong gains.   Relative to a year earlier, receipts in 
January and February rose 11 percent.  Coll ections of withheld individual income and 
payroll taxes increased 11 percent—a noticeably faster pace than in the preceding twelve 
months, and nonwithheld individual income and payroll taxes jumped 16 percent.  These 
estimated nonwithheld payments primarily reflect the fourth quarterly payment on 2006 
tax liability; the strength in these quarterly payments suggest s that tax liabilities have 
continued to rise faster than pers onal income, as measured by the NIPA.10  Outlays in 
January and February increased 4 percent comp ared with the year- earlier period.  Outlays 
growth has stepped down in recent months, in  part because of a return to more-normal 
levels of disaster assistance spending and in  part because of a sl owing in the rate of 
growth of defense spending.  On a NIPA ba sis, the January and February data are 
consistent with little change in real defe nse spending this quarte r relative to last. 
 The Administration released its proposed budget for fiscal 2008 on February 5.  The 
Administration expects the fiscal 2007 budget de ficit to total $244 b illion, little changed 
from last year; the fiscal 2008 deficit is projected to be  $239 billion if the 
Administration’s policies are enacted.
11  The key near-term policy proposals include 
increased defense spending—for both the global war on terror and other defense 
operations—and a one-year extensi on of alternative minimum tax relief for individuals.  
The Administration proposes to balance th e budget by 2012 through cutting real outlays 
on discretionary programs over the next five years.12 
 In mid-February, the Congress passed a continuing resolution to fund government 
operations through the remainder of the fiscal  year.  With the new legislation, the  
                                                
 
10 Detailed data allowing us to identify the sources  of the pick-up in 2006 tax liabilities are not yet 
available.  However, data for prior years point to a number of potential sources, including outsized capital 
gains realizations, which are not included in personal income, and shifts in the income distribution toward 
those in higher tax brackets. 
11 According to the CBO’s preliminary analysis, if  the President’s policies are enacted, the budget 
deficit would be $214 billion in fiscal 2007 and $226 billion in fiscal 2008. 
12 The budget proposes to boost real defense outlays 10 percent from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2008.  In 
subsequent years, however, the budget  projects declines in real defens e outlays because of reduced funding 
for the global war on terror, so that by 2012 real spending is 8 percent lower than it was in fiscal 2006.  
Real nondefense outlays are projected to fall 15 percent over the next five years.

Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that nondefense discretionary spending will 
be about unchanged in fiscal 2007 as declines in hurricane-related ou tlays are offset by 
increases elsewhere.  The Congress is now considering the Admini stration’s request for 
$100 billion of additional defense funding for fiscal 2007.  
State and Local Government Sector  
Recent data suggest that real purchases by stat e and local governments are rising solidly.   
Employment gains so far this quarter have b een similar to the relatively strong gains in 
2006:  Employment rose 23,000, on average, in January and February, compared with an 
average monthly increase of 21,000 in 2006.  In  contrast, recent data on construction 
suggest a pause in the strong growth expe rienced in 2006.  In Ja nuary, the level of 
nominal outlays for construction was 2 percent ab ove its fourth-quarter average (not at an 
annual rate). However, because prices for cons truction-related materials have been rising 
rapidly of late, much of this incr ease likely reflects  higher costs.  
 State governments continue to report favorab le fiscal conditions , and these conditions 
now appear to be leading polic ymakers to increase spending.  According to the National 
Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), st ate government revenues rose 7¾ percent in 
fiscal year 2006 (the fiscal year ends on June 30 for most states), 5 percentage points 
faster than states’ projections at the start of the fiscal year.  The NCSL reports that more 
than half the states bolstered their reserve funds with some of th is unexpected revenue, 
but most spent at least a porti on of it as well.  Spending on capital projects was reported 
to be particularly prevalent, which is cons istent with the 2006 surge in state and local 
investment spending estimated in the NIPA.  Th e favorable fiscal climate also appears to 
be spurring increased spending this year; on average, fiscal year  2007 budgets anticipate 
that general fund spending will increase 2 per centage points faster than was expected at 
the same point in last year’s budget cycle.  
Prices   
The total PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in January, as a dec line in energy prices partly 
offset a 0.7 percent jump in food prices and an  increase of 0.3 percent in the core index.  
On a twelve-month-change basis, PCE price inflation was 2 percent, down 1.2 percentage 
points from a year earlier; a deceleration in energy prices more than accounted for the 
reduction in overall PCE infl ation over this period. 
 
January’s rise of 0.3 percent in core PC E prices followed two consecutive monthly 
increases of 0.1 percent.  Core PCE inflati on was held down in November and December

by unusually low rates of increase for nonmarke t PCE prices and by a dip in goods price 
inflation.  Over the twelve months ending in January, core PCE prices accelerated 
0.3 percentage point, to a rate  of increase of 2.3 percent; si milarly, market-based core 
PCE inflation picked up 0.4 per centage point over this period,  to a 2 percent rate.  The 
increase in both of these measures of core consumer price inflation over the past year was 
driven importantly by a sharp ac celeration in shelter costs. 
 The energy component of the PCE price index fell 1.6 percent in January; over the past 
twelve months, energy prices have declined nearly 3 percent, compared with a year-
earlier increase of more than 24 percent.  Th e drop in energy prices in January was broad-
based:  Prices for gasoline and motor oil, he ating fuel, and natural gas all declined about 
3 percent.  In contrast, electricity prices rose  2 percent, apparently reflecting periodic rate 
adjustments in some areas.  Through late January, falling crude oil costs helped hold 
down prices for petroleum-based energy produc ts, while warmer-than-usual weather this 
winter allowed inventories of  petroleum products and natural gas to move above their 
seasonal norms.  However, demand during th e recent spell of extremely cold weather 
pared these inventories back toward more-normal levels, and crude costs have moved 
higher of late.  Although available survey data  point to little change in consumer energy 
prices in February, these prices appear  headed for a large increase in March. 
 The PCE price index for food and beverages ro se 0.7 percent in January after having been 
about unchanged in the preceding two months .  While prices increased for most 
categories of foodstuffs, the rise in fru it and vegetable prices was particularly 
pronounced, largely because of the effects of cold weather in the western part of the 
country.  Food prices were also boosted by the pass-through of earlie r sharp increases in 
spot prices for grain and livestock.  In recen t weeks, low inventories and adverse weather 
forecasts for the coming season have caused spot and futures prices for corn to rise.  As 
corn prices have moved higher and unusua lly cold weather has stressed animals, 
producers have been slaughtering animals at lower weights; the reduction in output from 
lower average weights has raised prices for beef and pork.  Broader measures of inflation moved lower in 2006, led by a sharp deceleration in energy 
prices.  Despite the small increase in core PCE price inflation, the price index for GDP 
less food and energy decelerated, re flecting slower rates of incr ease in the prices for other 
components of final demand, especially construction.

II-40 
Survey measures of inflation expectations were  little changed in February.  As measured 
by the Reuters/University of Michigan inde x, the median expectation for year-ahead 
inflation remained at 3 percen t last month.  The median fi ve- to ten-year expectation 
edged down to 2.9 percent and is ¼ percentage  point lower than its recent peak last 
August.  Ten-year-ahead expected CPI in flation from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) also edged down 0.1 percen tage point last month after having held 
steady at 2.5 percent for the past five years and after having averaged 2.5 percent in every 
year since 1998.13 
 At earlier stages of processi ng, the producer price index (PPI) for core intermediate goods 
was unchanged in January for the second month in a row.  The twelve-month change in 
this index was 3.8 percent in January, down a bout 1 percentage point from a year ago.  
Part of the slowdown in price inflation fo r intermediate goods can be traced to a 
deceleration in the prices for many energy-intensive materials that occurred in response to the sharp slowing in en ergy prices over this period. 
 Commodity prices have moved higher in recent weeks.  The Commodity Research 
Bureau’s spot index of industrial material s is up 2.8 percent sin ce the January Greenbook, 
while the Journal of Commerce  index of industrial materi als has risen 2 percent; both 
commodity price indexes have been boosted by a jump in metals prices. 
 
Labor Costs   
Labor costs have accelerated over the past ye ar, although the extent of the increase in 
compensation inflation differs across measures  and is further obscured by special factors 
that temporarily boosted NIPA estimates of wage and salary  accruals in the fourth 
quarter.    Over the three months ending in December, the employment cost index (ECI) for hourly 
compensation of private industry workers rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent.  The ECI 
also increased 3.2 percent over the twelve m onths of 2006 as a whole, 0.3 percentage 
                                                
 
13 The downtick in the SPF expectations measure was surprising enough that the research department 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (which conducts the SPF) examined how individual forecasters’ responses contributed to the change.  The researchers indicated that although a fraction of the 
revision could have resulted from changes to the co mposition of the panel of forecasters, “changing views 
on the long-run inflation outlook among those partic ipants who submitted projections in both surveys 
accounts for some of the downward re vision.”  (Note, however, that ther e were also additions made to the 
inflation questions asked in the survey:  For the first time, quarterly core CPI and quarterly top-line and 
core PCE forecasts were solicited, as were forecasts for long-run  top-line PCE price inflation.) 
II-41 
point faster than the rise in 2005.  The wa ge and salary component of the ECI rose 
3.2 percent in 2006, up 0.7 percentage point from the previous year.  In contrast, benefit 
costs slowed over this period, as indicat ed by December’s twelve-month change of 
3.1 percent, down nearly 1 percentage point from the increase in 2005.  Although 
increases in pension costs and some component s of benefits that ar e closely related to 
movements in wage rates—namely, Social S ecurity and paid leav e—picked up in 2006, 
increases in a number of other benefits costs were slower, with nonproduction bonuses 
posting a particularly sharp deceleration.  In line with the Productivity  and Costs (P&C) release, we estimate that hourly 
compensation in the nonfarm business sector ju mped at an annual rate of 8.2 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 2006 after a downward-re vised increase of 0.6 pe rcent in the third 
quarter.  On a four-quarter basis, comp ensation per hour rose 4.9 percent over 2006, up 
1.2 percentage points from the preceding year.
14  The fourth-quarter increase reflected the 
BEA’s assumption that bonus payments and stock option exercises added $50 billion 
(annual rate) to wage and salary accrual s, on which the P&C hourly compensation 
estimate is based.15  
 Average hourly earnings rose  0.2 percent in January and 0.4 percent in February.  These 
increases left the change in average hourly  earnings over the twel ve months ending in 
February at 4.1 percent, up 0.6 perc entage point from a year ago. 
                                                
 
14 The downward revision to 2006:Q3 P&C hourly compensation growth—which was previously 
estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 3.1 percent—mainly stems from the incorporation of third-quarter state UI tax data into the BEA’s compensatio n estimates.  In addition, the BLS incorporated the 
annual benchmark revision to the es tablishment survey data into its P&C estimates.  This resulted in 
revisions to hours (and hence hourly compensation) back to 2002 and lowered the Q4-to-Q4 change in 
hourly compensation growth 0.2 percentage point in 2006 and 0.4 percentage point in 2005 (revisions to earlier years were much smaller). 
15 News stories indicate that bonus payments by Wall Str eet firms surged to record levels at the turn of 
the year.  These payments were made —and show up as wage and salary disbursements —in early 2007.  
(Note that the BEA will not have actual source data for 2007:Q1 wage and salary disbursements until the 
preliminary estimate of 2007:Q2 GD P is prepared in August.)  Howe ver, the BEA assumed that these 
bonuses represented remuneration for productive activity in 2006:Q4 and therefore imputed them to that period’s compensation bill. 
In addition, note that an increase in bonus payments of this sort would in principle show up in the 
benefits component of the ECI in the first quarter of  2007.  (In contrast, the ECI excludes stock option 
exercises entirely.)

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Financial markets were especially turbulen t at times over the intermeeting period as 
investors apparently became less confident about the underlying strength of the U.S. 
economic expansion and somewhat less willi ng to hold risky assets .  Although market 
participants were steady in their conviction that the FOMC will keep policy unchanged at 
the upcoming meeting, they marked down their predicted path for monetary policy later 
this year and next.  Nominal Treasury yiel ds moved lower across th e curve.  Yields on 
Treasury inflation-protected s ecurities (TIPS) also decline d, and inflation compensation 
edged lower except in the very near term.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds 
fell about as much as those on comparable -maturity Treasury securities, but those on 
speculative-grade bonds fell somewh at less, leaving risk spread s wider.  Equity markets 
ended the period with fairly sizable losses.   Overall household and business credit quality 
remained favorable, although the subprime mo rtgage sector has deteriorated notably. 
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Market participants largely anticipated the FOMC’s policy decision at the January 
meeting, but yields edged lower,  as some investors reportedly  interpreted the discussion 
of inflation prospects in th e statement as somewhat more optimistic than they had 
anticipated.  The Monetary Policy Repor t to the Congress and the Chairman’s 
accompanying testimony also prompted a modest decline in short-term interest rates, as 
investors focused on the Chairman’s remark that “inflation pressures are beginning to 
diminish” and on the downwardly revised centr al tendencies of the FOMC’s projections 
for real GDP growth.  Policy expectations for the upcoming meeting changed little during 
the intermeeting period, as investors continue d to expect the Committee to keep policy on 
hold.  However, at longer horizons, the exp ected path for monetary policy moved down, 
on balance, with the most visible shift acco mpanying the sharp market moves at the end 
of February.  The mixed economic data rel eased over the intermeeting period had only a 
modest net effect on policy expectations, but  concerns that problems in the subprime 
mortgage sector might weigh on economic activity may have contributed to the 
downward shift.  Investors now see about a 40 percent chance of at least 25 basis points 
of easing by June, and they also expect a cumulative reduction of roughly 100 basis 
points in the target rate by the end of 2008, about 50 basis points more than before the 
January meeting.    Investors became markedly more uncertain a bout the path for monetary policy.  Implied 
volatilities inferred from options on Eurodolla r futures moved up in late February from 
near historical lows and stayed near those mo re moderate levels ther eafter.  In addition,

the options-implied distributions of funds ra tes between three and twelve months ahead 
are now considerably more skewed toward lower interest rates.    Two- and ten-year nominal Treasury yields  decreased about 40 and 35 basis points, 
respectively, over the intermeeting period.  Move ments at the short end of the curve were 
generally consistent with th e downwardly revised policy ou tlook, and the apparent shift 
toward less risky assets by investors may have depressed yields further out the term 
structure.  Indeed, movements in Treasury yiel ds closely tracked the ups and downs in the 
stock market, particularly during the periods of  heightened financial market volatility.  
Real yields also declined, albeit by less than  nominal rates, genera lly leaving TIPS-based 
inflation compensation slightly lower despite a rise in oil prices.   
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Stock prices drifted up early in the intermeeting period, as earnings reports continued to 
be solid.  However, equity markets plunge d on February 27 and declined further on 
balance over the period, reflecting some pullback  from risk as well as increased concerns 
about the economic outlook and the condition of some subprime lenders.  On net, broad 
stock price indexes are down 3 percent to 4 percent since the last FOMC meeting.  The 
spread between the twelve-m onth forward trend earnings-p rice ratio for S&P 500 firms 
and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough ga uge of the equity risk premium—widened 
somewhat but remained within its range of th e past few years.  Implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 index shot up on February 27 from very low levels and stayed somewhat 
elevated.      On net over the intermeeting period, yields  on investment-grade corporate bonds fell 
about in line with those on comparable-maturity  Treasury securities, leaving their spreads 
little changed at low levels.  Bond spreads and CDS premiums for several investment 
banks that may be exposed directly to the subprime mortgage market widened some but 
are within the range of the past couple of years.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds 
widened about 25 basis points, mostly since la te February, but remained low.  Liquidity 
in corporate bond markets, as measured by tr ading volume and estimat ed bid-ask spreads, 
remained ample during the recen t turbulence.  Trading volume  in the CDS market also 
reportedly stayed strong.  Spreads on commercial paper were low and stable. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firm s increased about 12 percent over the year 
ending in the fourth quarter, a deceleration fr om the remarkably strong pace earlier in

2006.  Revisions to year-ahead earnings exp ectations remained moderately negative; 
about half of the decline wa s attributable to the energy sector.  Investment banks 
reporting quarterly data endi ng in February generally posted large gains in earnings. 
  Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms have stayed strong.  Data in hand for 
the fourth quarter of 2006 indicate that corporate cash holdings relative to assets 
continued to recede but remained high and that the ratio of debt to total assets stayed low.  
In the first two months of the year, the vol ume of bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of 
downgrades.  The realized six-month traili ng bond default rate stayed near zero in 
February, and the delinquency rate on C&I loan s in the fourth quarter was the lowest in 
more than a decade.  The January forecast of the aggregate year-ahead default rate from 
KMV was the lowest since 1998, although the measure for February could tick up 
because stock market volatility is  a key input into KMV’s model. 
 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms has been solid this quarter, and a notable 
fraction of the proceeds has been used to refi nance existing debt.  In  addition, as has been 
the case in the past few quarters, issuance of speculative-grade bonds has been boosted 
by strong merger and acquisiti on financing.  Bond issuance has been strong in early 
March despite recent market turbulence.  C&I loans have continued to expand 
moderately; lenders appear to have remained  accommodative despite th e recent volatility.  
In contrast, commercial paper outstanding has declined, in pa rt because some firms paid 
down what appeared to be bri dge financing for acquisitions.  Overall, net debt financing 
is estimated to have moderated in the first quarter from the rapid fourth-quarter pace, although it remains reasonably robust.  Gross public equity issuance, both seasoned o fferings and IPOs, has also moderated this 
quarter, with the slowdown emerging before the recent volatility in equity markets.  Data 
for the fourth quarter indicate that privat e equity issuance proceeded apace and was 
fueled by strong leveraged buyout activity.  Sti ll, gross equity issuance continued to be 
dwarfed by the extraordinary pace of equity re tirements.  Boosted by strong profits and 
ample cash on corporate balance sheets, reti rements from cash-financed mergers and 
acquisitions reached a new record high in the fourth quarter.  
 
Commercial Real Estate

suggests that issuance will be strong in the cu rrent quarter.  Spreads on investment-grade 
CMBS widened in late February to their highest level since ea rly 2006, as investors 
reportedly reacted to the increased volatility in equity and subprime mortgage markets.   
 The rapid growth of commercial mortgage debt  in recent years has been associated with 
rising leverage on new mortgage s.  The percentage of newl y securitized mo rtgages with 
loan-to-value ratios gr eater than 80 percent has increased substantially over the past year, 
and the ratio of scheduled mortgage payments  to property income for these mortgages is 
in the upper part of the range seen in the past few years.  As yet, however, delinquency 
rates on CMBS and commercial mortgages held  by life insurance companies remain low.  
The delinquency rate on commercial mortgage s held by commercial banks has risen in 
recent quarters, but the rise appears to be driven mainly by construction and land 
development loans, many of which are tied  to residential real estate projects. 
 Further large increases in commercial property pr ices in the fourth quarter led to another 
decline in the ratio of net operating income to  property prices.  The spread of this ratio 
over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough measure of the risk premium on 
commercial real estate assets, remains in th e lower part of the range observed over the 
past decade. 
 
Household Finance  
Interest rates available to prime borrowers  on both thirty-year fixed-rate and one-year 
adjustable-rate mortgages decreas ed slightly over the intermee ting period.  As origination 
volumes and house-price growth slowed, mortga ge debt decelerated substantially further 
in the fourth quarter.  Growth of consumer  credit remained moderate through January.  
 Although the financial obligations  ratio was at its historical  high in the fourth quarter, 
readings on household credit quality con tinued to be favorable on the whole.  
Delinquency rates on consumer loans and prim e mortgages, which account for the vast 
majority of total household debt, remained low, as did delinquency rates on subprime 
fixed-rate mortgages.  Delinquency rates on subprime variable-rat e mortgages have continued to climb, 
however.  Some borrowers apparently have  had difficulty coping with large upward 
adjustments to their contract rates against a backdrop of flatter house prices.  Moreover, 
an evident loosening of underwriting standard s has meant that subpr ime loans originated 
in 2006 are going delinquent at a considerably faster pace than other recent vintages.

III-11 
Lenders have increasingly had to repurchase loans previously securitized because of so-
called “early payment defaults,”  and investors have reportedl y stepped up their scrutiny 
of loans going into securitiza tions.  As a result of these developments, a number of 
monoline subprime lenders have shut their door s.  Spreads on CDS indexes for pools of 
subprime mortgages originated last year con tinued to climb, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  The bank supervisory agencies have  issued for comment expanded guidance for 
some types of subprime mortgage lending.  Home-price appreciation as measured by the four-quarter change in the OFHEO 
purchase-only index slowed further in th e fourth quarter.  The modest downward 
trajectory for expected home pr ices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets over the 
next few quarters, derived from futures quotes on the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price 
index, was largely unchanged over the inte rmeeting period.  Notwithstanding the small 
increases in home prices, the ratio of household net worth to  disposable personal income 
rose notably in the fourth quarter owing to th e rise in stock prices.  Net inflows to long-
term mutual funds approached record levels  in January and February, propelled by strong 
inflows to world equity funds and bond funds.  Domestic equity funds also attracted 
substantial net new cash after several quarters of net outflows.  However, equity funds 
had net outflows in the first week of March, suggesting that investor s were put off by the 
market turbulence that began in late February. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury au ctioned securities across the maturity 
spectrum, and demand was reportedly strong amid  some reduction in auction sizes.  As 
part of its midquarter refunding statement, the Treasury announced that it is considering 
eliminating the three-year note from its au ction calendar and that  it will announce its 
decision at the May refunding af ter April tax receipts have been evaluated.  Various 
indicators suggest that foreign demand for no minal Treasury securities held steady:  
Foreign custody holdings of Treasury securiti es at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York increased somewhat, and the six-month rolling average of th e proportion of two-, 
five-, and ten-year note auctions awarded to foreign investors stayed relatively high.  
News that China plans to manage a part of its international reserves more aggressively 
than in the past had little  effect on Treasury yields. 
 The market for Treasury securities functioned well despite the recent heightened financial 
market volatility.  The combined volume of trad ing in two-, five-, and ten-year on-the-run 
Treasury notes estimated from BrokerTec data reached a record high during the week of

February 27.  Trading appears to have been orderly:  Bid-ask spr eads remained within 
normal ranges, and market participants  characterized liquidity as normal. 
 The stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac decreased a touch more than the broad 
equity indexes over the intermeeting peri od, and yield spreads on agency debt over 
comparable-maturity Treasuries widened some what on net.  Congressman Barney Frank, 
chairman of the House Fina ncial Services Committee, has introduced legislation on 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that  somewhat strengthens  the GSEs’ safety 
and soundness regulation but falls short of th e reforms supported by the Federal Reserve 
Board.  The House will hold hearings on the Frank bill over the next few weeks, and a vote on the bill is likely in April.  A substa ntial majority in the House is expected to 
support the bill.  However, to date, there seem s to have been little action in the Senate 
regarding GSE legislation. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
The pace of gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds has b een solid thus far in the 
first quarter, although it has not  reached the outsized fourth -quarter pace.  Advance 
refunding issuance increased a bit, but new cap ital issuance slowed notably.  In view of 
the sizable bond capacities appr oved in a number of states in the November elections, the 
slowdown is likely to be only temporary.  Issuance of short- term municipal bonds 
continued to be modest.  The credit qualit y of municipal bonds remained solid, and the 
number of bonds with rating upgrades c ontinued to far outpace the number with 
downgrades over the intermeeting period.    
Money and Bank Credit  
M2 expanded at an annual rate  of about 5¼ percent in Febr uary, down from a more than 
10 percent pace in January.  The slowdown in February was led by a moderation in the rate of growth of liquid deposits, the larges t component of M2, after outsized gains in 
January.  Decelerations this year in small time deposits and retail money market funds 
likely owe to a narrowing of the spread betw een the rates paid on these and alternative 
assets.  Currency contracted a bit in Februa ry, a development that reflected a further 
softening of foreign demand.  Growth of commercial bank credit is estimated to have picked up notab ly in the first two 
months of the year from the sluggish pace of the fourth quarter.  The acceleration was 
largely the result of an increase in banks’ purch ases of securities and faster growth in 
banks’ holdings of real estate loans.  Loan price data from the Survey of Terms of

Business Lending conducted during the week of  February 5 indicate that the average 
spread of C&I loan rates over banks’ cost of funds, adjusted  for changes in nonprice loan 
characteristics, edged down further in the first quarter.  The decline mainly occurred at 
domestic banks.  At these institutions, sp reads on higher-risk loans not made under 
previous commitment—a category of loans that reflects the most recent  pricing trends for 
risky credits—are at levels not seen since th e first half of 1998.  Reportedly, the reaction 
in the U.S. syndicated loan market to the recent turbulence in financial markets was 
generally muted. 
  According to the latest Call Report data, pr ofitability in the commercial banking sector 
improved further in the fourth quarter of  2006.  Supported by growth in all income 
components, the industry return on assets rose  to its highest level in many years, while 
the return on equity also incr eased notably.  Credit quality re mained excellent, as charge-
off rates on all loans and leases remained very low by historical  standards, although 
delinquency rates edged up from low levels  in the second half of the year.

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowe d considerably to $714.4 billion (annual rate) 
in the fourth quarter, as a 9.7 percent increase in the value of expor ts was coupled with a 
9.7 percent decrease in the va lue of imports.  Exports of aircraft and services rose 
robustly, even as exports of automotive pr oducts fell back from their elevated third-
quarter level and exports of semiconductors declined for the sec ond consecutive quarter.  
The decline in imports primarily reflected a fa ll in both the volume and price of imported 
oil.  In addition, imports of non-oil industr ial supplies and capita l goods declined, more 
than offsetting a strong increase in imports of  consumer goods and a smaller increase in 
imports of automotive products.

In January, the trade deficit narrowed to $59.1 billion from $61.5 billion in December 
(revised).  The narrowing of the deficit refl ected both higher exports and lower imports.  
The value of exports of goods and services  increased 1.1 percent following a 0.4 percent 
increase in December.  The January increase  reflected a jump in the exports of goods, 
which more than offset a slight decline in exports of services.  Within goods, exports

of capital goods moved up briskl y, led by a particularly  large jump in exports of aircraft 
and also supported by higher exports of computers and semiconductors.  Exports of 
industrial supplies exhi bited strong growth, boosted by a ju mp in exports of petroleum 
products, as did exports of consumer goods and agricultural produc ts.  In contrast, 
automotive exports fell back in January following a strong December. 
 
The value of imported goods and services fell 0.5 percent in January following a 
2.1 percent increase in December.  In January, lower imports of non-oil goods more than offset higher imports of oil and services.  Th e fall in imports of non-oil goods was led by 
large declines in imports of automotive products, which moved down from an elevated 
level in December, and consumer goods, whic h were held back by a decline in apparel 
imports.  Imports of non-oil industrial supplies also declined.  In contrast, imports of 
foods rose, and imports of capital goods clim bed sharply, led by a jump in imports of 
computers. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In both January and February, import prices for non-oil goods fell 
0.1 percent.  In January, this figure was held down by natural gas prices, which fell more than 13 percent, but in February natural gas pr ices turned back up with the onset of colder 
weather.  Import prices fo r core goods rose 0.3 percent in January but then fell 0.1 
percent in February.  Prices for import ed capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and nonfuel industrial supplies bo th fell in February after rising strongly 
in January.  The February decline in indus trial supplies was led by prices of imported 
metals, which fell sharply.  Prices for finished goods fell slightly in  February, after rising 
modestly in the two prior months. 
 
The average level of core import prices in January and February was 2¾ percent at an 
annual rate above the fourth-quarter averag e.  Prices for a wide variety of goods 
accelerated in the first quarter, includi ng capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors), consumer goods, foods, and nonfuel industrial supp lies.  In addition, 
prices of imported computers continued to decline, and prices of imported 
semiconductors fell after a rare increase in the previous quarter. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 2 percent in February, considerably less 
than the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, which rose 9 percent in 
February and averaged around $59 per barrel fo r the month.  Thus far in March, the spot 
price has averaged more than $60 per barrel, bu t has fallen over the past few days to close 
IV-5 
at $57.94 per barrel on March 13.  Despite the recent decline, oil prices remain above 
their average level in January.  This rise in oil prices over the past two months reflects 
OPEC production restraint, a worseni ng of ongoing production problems in Iraq and 
Nigeria, and increased concern about a possi ble disruption of expor ts from Iran.  Strong 
oil demand in the United States, owing in pa rt to below-normal temperatures, has also 
supported oil prices. 
 
Exports.   In January and February, export prices  for core goods rose 0.5 and 0.8 percent, 
respectively.  Prices for material-intensive  goods were held down in January by a large 
decline in the price of expor ted fuels and boosted in Februa ry as fuel prices bounced 
back.  Prices for exported nonagricultural i ndustrial supplies rose in both months, and 
prices for agricultural products shot up in February, primarily  reflecting higher prices for 
corn and soybeans.  Corn prices have risen as a result of higher demand for ethanol, while 
soybean prices have moved up as farmers have shifted acreage away from soybeans to 
corn.  Prices for all major categories of finished goods m oved up in January but were 
basically flat in February. 
 
The average level of core export prices in January and February was about 6½ percent at 
an annual rate above the fourth-quarter average; prices for both finished and material-intensive goods accelerated in the first qua rter.  The acceleration was particularly 
pronounced for nonagricultural indu strial supplies, which fell  5½ percent in the fourth 
quarter but jumped more than 9 percent on average so far in the first quarter.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions
 table) surged in December afte r two relatively weak months of inflows, 
largely because of record inflows from count ries other than the G10 and OPEC.  For the 
year as a whole, foreign o fficial inflows were up 50 per cent from 2005, but were below 
the record $385 billion inflows registered in 2004.    
 
 
 
.   
 
The chart on Foreign Official Financial Fl ows provides a broader perspective on these 
data.  The G
-10 countries have fluctuated be tween small inflows into and outflows from 
the United States in recent months, with the trend remaining a modest net outflow.  
OPEC countries have registered small inflow s, on average, over the past year; January 
inflows were slightly above the recent trend.  Inflows from countries other than the G-10 
and OPEC have been growing over the past few years, with quite strong inflows in the past few months.    Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities  (line 4 of the table and the top panels of 
the chart on Private Secu
rities Flows) slowed  in December but for the year as a whole 
continued their upward trend.  Purchases of corporate bonds (line 4c ), despite moderating 
a bit in December, moved up sharply for the year as a whole relative to the level 
registered in 2005.  Net purchases of Treasur ies in 2006 were much more modest than 
those recorded in 2005, with net sales recorded in December.  Private foreigners also sold 
agencies and corporate stocks (lines 4b a nd 4d, respectively) in December, though total 
purchases in 2006 were above their 2005 levels.  In January, private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities bounced back from their December lull, as demand for corporate bonds 
remained strong, and transactions in Treasur ies, agencies, and corporate stocks all 
switched back to net purchases.   Most transactions were r ecorded against the financial 
centers of the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands.      U.S. private acquisitions of foreign securities p
 icked up noticeably near yearend (line 5 of 
the table and the bottom panels of the chart on Private Securities Flow s), with the fourth 
quarter accounting for over 40 percent of the year’s total.  Bond purchases increased 
throughout the year and hit a record level in December.  As a result, net bond purchases 
in 2006 were threefold those recorded in 2005.  Purchases of stocks picked up in the final 

IV-9 
two months of the year and helped to move 2006 net acqui sitions up towards the level 
recorded in 2005.  Equities acquired through st ock swaps also increased in the fourth 
quarter.  In January, U.S. private acquisitions slowed slightly from their recent trend, as 
stock purchases remained near their trend a nd net acquisitions of bonds moderated in line 
with lower new issuance of foreign bonds  in the United States in the month. 
 
Flows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) tend to be volatile.  They recorded net 
inflows for 2006 as a whole, and a mode st outflow in January.       
 
Fourth-quarter balance of payments data (r eleased on March 14) will be discussed in the 
Greenbook supplement.

Foreign Financial Markets 
 
Over the intermeeting period, the major currenc ies index of the dollar’s exchange value 
declined 1¼ percent on net, li kely reflecting concerns abou t some weaker-than-expected 
data releases in the United States.  Beginning in late February, there were several days of 
heightened exchange rate volatility, sharp declines in global equity prices, and a widening 
of risk spreads on corporate and emerging mark et securities.  This episode, which came 
amid reports that several U.S. subprime mortgage lenders were facing financial 
difficulties, was triggered in part by a 9 percen t fall in Chinese equity prices on February 
27.  During the episode, international investor s appeared to scale back risky positions 
financed in low interest rate currencies, part icularly the Japanese ye n and the Swiss franc.  
The unwinding of these “carry trades” seemed  to be partially reversed late in the 
intermeeting period, as equity prices in most markets recove red some of their losses and 
exchange rate volatility declined.  However, as this Greenbook was put to press, global 
equity prices were declining again amid growing concerns about the U.S. subprime 
mortgage sector.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated 3 ¾  percent versus the yen 
and 2 ¼  percent against the Swiss franc on net over the intermeeting period.  The dollar 
also depreciated 1½ percent ag ainst the euro and ½ percent versus the Canadian dollar, 
but it appreciated 2 percent versus sterling.  Option-implied volatility on the dollar-yen 
exchange rate jumped up in late February from a near-record-low level and remained significantly above recent lows through the e nd of the period; euro -dollar option-implied 
volatility, in contrast, remained low.   
 
Headline equity indexes in Eu rope ended the period down 2 to 5 percent on net, while

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Overall economic activity in th e advanced foreign economies accelerated in the fourth 
quarter, supported by strong investment spendi ng and firm exports.  In Japan, private 
consumption rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter, while private investment and net 
exports continued to be important contri butors to growth.  The pace of economic 
expansion picked up in the euro area largely as a result of increases in investment 
spending and exports, with consumption growth  remaining solid.  Growth in the United 
Kingdom also firmed as a result of bris k investment spending and a rebound in 
consumption growth.  In contrast, output in  Canada decelerated in the fourth quarter 
following a sharp slowdown in inventory accumulation.  
 
Inflationary pressures remain low in most  foreign advanced economies in January and 
February, helped in part by lower energy pri ces at the start of the year.  The Bank of 
Japan and the European Central Bank nevertheless decided to raise their policy rates  
¼ percentage point at their last meetings.   
 
In Japan , real GDP grew 5.5 (s.a.a.r.) percent in the fourth quarter, rebounding from  
0.5 percent growth in the th ird quarter.  Household consumption grew 4.2 percent, 
offsetting a surprising 4.2 percen t fall in the third quarter.  Private investment continued 
to be strong, growing 12.5 percent, and net exports contributed 0.5 percentage points to 
growth, as exports rose and impor ts fell for the second quarter in a row.  In contrast to the 
first three quarters of the year, the public sector contributed 0.6 percentage points to  
growth, as public investment grew 15.6 percent.  However, public investment is likely to 
resume its decline.  
 
Recent indicators suggest that consumption growth is firming and point to continued strength in net exports.  R eal expenditures by all households  in January were 1.4 percent 
higher than a year earlier, th e first such increase in more than a year.  Moreover, retail 
sales also rose in January from December.  The Bank of Japan’s measure of the real trade 
surplus increased in January as real exports rose 1.8 percent while re al imports contracted 
5 percent.  However, industr ial production fell 1.5 per cent in January, the biggest 
monthly decline in almost three years, and shipments of machinery also fell.  Housing 
starts continued to slide, falling 3.6 percent in January.

The unemployment rate held steady at 4 percen t in January and the offers-to-applicants 
ratio (the number of official ly posted job openings relative to the number of officially 
registered job seekers) fell a tad but remains at the elevated level of 1.06.  Nevertheless, 
gross earnings, which include bonuses, were 1.4 percent lower than a year ago, the largest 
decline in more than two years.  
 
Recent indicators point to w eak inflationary pressures.  The headline consumer price 
index was flat in January and was also unchange d from a year earlier.  Core CPI inflation 
(excluding fresh food only) was 0.2 percent higher than a year earlier, while the 
twelve-month rate of wholesale price inflati on continued to modera te in January.  The 
GDP deflator fell 0.5 percent from a year ago in the fourth quarter. 
 
Despite the weak price data, the Bank of Japan raised its target for the overnight call rate 
25 basis points to 0.5 percent in February.  The Bank left its core economic assessment 
unchanged from January, repeating that a m oderate economic expansion continues.

Euro-area  GDP increased 3.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in  the fourth quarter, well up from its 
pace in the previous quarter.  The growth ra te of investment spending more than doubled 
from the third quarter to 4.9 percent.  E xports surged 15.6 percent, and net exports 
contributed 3.2 percentage poi nts to GDP growth, although th is contribution was partly 
offset by a drawdown in inventories.  Consum ption remained solid, at 2.2 percent, a bit 
below the third-quarter pace in spite of any pull-ahead in spending coming from the 
January’s hike in the German value-added ta x.  At the country level, Italy posted the 
biggest surprise, as its GDP growth surged to  4.7 percent, the best quarterly performance 
in eight years.  All othe r major economies of the euro area also posted solid 
performances.

Recent indicators for the euro area have ge nerally remained robust.  The European 
Commission indicator of economic sentiment bounced back in February from the dip 
posted in January. Consumer sentiment im proved sharply, largely owing to better 
employment prospects.  Confidence was unchange d in the industrial sector but fell in the 
construction sector.  These developments, together with February’s rebound of the 
purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for manufac turing, suggest that eu ro-area industrial  
production continues to expand at a healthy pace.   The PMI for the service sector fell in 
February, but its average in the first two months of the year remained above the 
fourth-quarter level.  However, substantia l declines in the production of energy and 
consumer durables led to a fall in euro -area industrial ou tput in January.  
 
Euro-area retail sales fell 0.9 percent in January from the previous month, more than 
offsetting sizable gains in November and December.  That pattern of sales largely 
reflected German consumers’ efforts to sh ift the timing of purchases to avoid the  
3 percentage points rise in the value-added tax that occurred at the beginning of the year.  
In contrast, in France, household consump tion of manufactured goods rose strongly in 
January for the second consecutive month.   
 
There is no indication that January’s plunge in German retail sales will derail the 
recovery of the euro-area largest economy.  In February, Germany's IFO business climate 
index remained close to the all-time high poste d in December.  Furthermore, the German 
employment rose for the elev enth straight month in January and has gained almost  
1.5 percent over the past year, even as the unemployment rate has fallen ½ percentage 
point since December.  In January, the eu ro-area unemployment rate declined to  
7.4 percent, down nearly a per centage point since the begi nning of 2006, and the lowest 
rate since Eurostat began measuring it in 1993. 
 
Euro-area consumer prices rose 0.3 percen t in February from the previous month, 
according to a preliminary estimate.  The twel ve-month rate of inflation was steady at  
1.9 percent.  The inflation figures in the first two months of the year came in below most 
analysts’ expectati ons; German prices did not rise as mu ch as expected in response to the 
January hike in the value-added tax.  In January, euro area core inflation (excluding 
energy and unprocessed food) in the euro ar ea rose to 1.8 percent from the 1.6 percent 
rate recorded in the last three months of  2006.  On March 8, the European Central Bank 
raised its key policy interest rate ¼ percentage point to 3.75 percent.  President Trichet 
said the ECB monetary policy “continues to  be on the accommodative side,” signaling 
that the tightening cycle is not yet over.

In the United Kingdom , recent economic data point to an increase in the pace of 
economic expansion supported by strong domest ic demand.  Real GDP growth firmed to 
3.1 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter  of 2006, as business investment expanded 
10.4 percent, and private consumption grew 4.1 percent, rebounding from 1.8 percent in 
the third quarter.  Net exports a nd inventories subtracted 0.8 and  
0.9 percentage points from GDP growth, respectively.

Business confidence soared in February as the net balance of fi rms expecting production 
increases over the next four months jumped  from 12 to 28 percent, its highest reading 
since May 1995.  The PMI for manufacturing ro se to 55.4 percent in February, its highest 
reading since July 2004.  The PMI for servi ces slid to 57.4 percent in February, but 
remained strong compared with previous history.  Retail sales, on the other hand, 
contracted 1.8 percent in Ja nuary following a 1.1 percent increase in December amid 
strong Christmas sales.  Consumer confiden ce edged up in February after hitting a  
45-month low in January.  The claimant c ount of the unemployment rate was unchanged 
at 2.9 percent in February and the Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate was similarly unchanged at 5.5 percent in December.

After reaching 3.0 percent in December, the tw elve-month change in headline prices slid 
to 2.7 percent in January, brought down by fa lling energy prices, especially fuel for 
transportation. The decline in part reflects the fact that these prices were generally on the 
rise a year earlier.  Aver age earnings including bonuses were 4.8 percent higher than a 
year earlier in January.  Pr oducer input prices fell 1.1 perc ent in the twelve-month period 
to February.  House price inflation remained elevated at about 10 percent in February.  
 
In Canada, real GDP grew only 1.4 percent (a.r .) in the fourth quarter, dragged down by   
slowdown in inventory accumulation. Exports contributed 2.2 percentage points to 
growth, their best showing of the year.  Final domestic demand decelerated but remained 
firm, with personal consumption and busin ess investment both growing solidly.  
Investment in residential st ructures edged up following a sharp third-quarter decline. 
 
The few available indicators for the first quarte r have been upbeat.  Due in part to warm 
weather, housing starts popped up in Januar y, with advances in both single-unit and 
multi-unit starts; February housing starts were cooler, but average housing starts in January and February were nonetheless a t ouch above their third-quarter average. 
The composite index of leading indicators reco rded its largest advance in five years in 
January.  The labor market also turned in another stellar performance in January and 
February, with total employment expanding mo re than it did during the entire fourth 
quarter, which itself was the second-largest ga in in four years.  Full-time employment 
growth, which has been especially strong in the past two years, continued to advance 
smartly.  The unemployment rate returned to 6.1 percent in Februar y, a generational low.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation declined to 1.2 percent in January 
from 1.6 percent in December, pushed by falling gasoline prices.  The twelve-month rate 
of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of 
indirect taxes, edged up to 2.1 percent in Janu ary from 2 percent in December.  Even so, 
the upward pressure on the core index from homeowners’ replacement costs continued to 
ease.  The twelve-month rate of new home pri ce inflation remained elevated at 10 percent 
in December, but was down slightly from the previous few months. Twelve-month house price inflation in the oil-pr oducing province of Alberta, wh ich leads the country with 
growth over 40 percent, has moved lower since the fall.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data from emerging Asian economies point to continued strength in economic 
activity, although there are signs of moderation in some countries.  Growth picked up in 
China in the fourth quarter, but declined in  some other emerging Asian economies such 
as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Thailand.  In La tin America, Mexican activity decelerated 
markedly in the fourth quarter, in part refl ecting a decline in manuf acturing exports to the 
United States.  However, growth picked up in Brazil and, especially, Venezuela, and remained strong in Argentina.  Inflationary pressures remain contained in most emerging 
market economies, although there have been so me increases in China, Mexico, India and 
Venezuela.  An acceleration of food prices largely accounts for the elevated inflation rates in China and Mexico.                 
 
In China , real GDP increased nearly 10 percent (a.r .) in the fourth quarter of last year, 
according to staff estimates.  Although this is a significant pick-up from its third-quarter pace, it still left average growth for th e second half of 2006 at about 8½ percent, 
considerably lower than the roaring 12-percent  pace in the first half.  Investment growth 
continued to moderate, slowing to about a 20- percent increase in th e fourth quarter from 
its year-earlier level.  But w eakness in domestic sectors was o ffset by strength in exports.  
The nominal trade balance has continued to surprise on the upside th is year, rising to a 
phenomenal $344 billion (a.r.) on average in th e first two months of this year.  The 
increase is broad-based, with exports in several sectors (including electronics and 
machinery, clothing, furniture, and steel) pos ting sizable gains.   After receding 
somewhat in January, twelve-month consum er price inflation picked up again in 
February, to 3 percent.  A lthough interpretation of these m onthly figures is complicated 
by the timing of the lunar calendar New Year  holiday, food prices, which have been the 
source of the pickup in inflation in recent m onths, remain elevated.  The acceleration in 
food prices reflects in part hi gh grain prices resulting from greater demand for biofuel.  
Grain prices are a sensitive issue in China, a nd the authorities will likely take measures to 
stabilize them should the increases persist.   
 
The plunge in the Chinese stock market at the end of February and the subsequent 
rebound did not appear to have any link to r eal economic fundamentals in China.  The 
drop from a very high level resulting from la st year’s run up seemed to be triggered by 
reports of a greater clamp down on speculative ac tivity in the market.  Fueled by the trade 
surplus, international reserves continue to ri se at a very fast cli p, necessitating tightening 
actions – such as sterilizati on and increases in th e banks’ required reserve ratio (RRR) – 
IV-33 
by Chinese authorities to manage the excess liq uidity problem.  However, this has been 
going on for some time; the most recent increase in the RRR of 50 basis points in 
mid-February was not a surprise and it was th e fifth such increase since last June.

In Hong Kong, real GDP growth moderated in the f ourth quarter, as an increase in the 
contribution of domestic demand to growth wa s more than offset by a decrease in the 
contribution from real net exports.  The no minal merchandise trade deficit widened in 
January for the fifth consecutive month, suggestin g the contribution of real net exports to 
growth will remain negative in the current qu arter.  However, the interpretation of the 
January figure is complicated by the timing of the lunar calend ar holiday this year, which 
can make appropriate seasonal adjustment of the data difficult.  Twelve-month inflation 
edged up in January, in part re flecting rising transport prices.

In Taiwan , fourth-quarter output growth also m oderated, largely reflecting contractions 
in investment and exports.  Industrial producti on fell in the fourth qua rter and registered 
only a minor increase in Januar y, with reductions in important sectors such as electronics 
and precision equipment weighing on activit y.  Also in January, export orders for 
electronic products edged down fo r the fourth consecutive month.  The merchandise trade 
balance was negative in January, but turned positive again in February.  Again, the timing 
of lunar calendar New Year hol iday makes interpretation of the monthly pattern difficult; 
the average trade balance for January and Februa ry combined was almost $6 billion (a.r.).  
After falling a bit in January, twelve-month consumer price inflation picked up to 1.7 percent in February.

In Korea , incoming data since the last Greenboo k have been mixed.  Output growth 
lowed to 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter, held down by sluggish consumption and a 
significant drawdown in invent ories.  In January, industr ial production only partially 
recovered from sizable declines in November and December.  Concerns over the appreciating exchange rate and government m easures to rein in the housing market have 
contributed to weakening consumer and busin ess confidence, and retail sales and service 
sector output fell in January.  Exports picked up in January, but a surge in imports and a large deficit in services led to a negati ve current account ba lance for the month.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation rema ins below the Bank of Korea’s target range 
of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.

Indian  economic indicators have remained robus t.  Real GDP rose 8.6 percent in the 
fourth quarter, with growth supported by contin ued strength in construction and services 
and by a rebound in agriculture after weakness in the previous  two quarters.  In January, 
industrial production rose almost 1 percent. Inflationary pressures appear to be mounting, 
however.  Twelve-month inflation of the clos ely watched wholesale price index rose to 
6.2 percent in January.  In response, the gove rnment lowered fuel prices for consumers 
and reduced import duties on a number of pr oducts, including cement.  Despite these 
measures, twelve-month wholesale price infl ation edged up further in February, to 
6.4 percent.  Credit growth has also been soar ing, and the Bank of I ndia raised the cash 
reserve ratio for banks ½ percen tage point to 6 percent.

Economic activity in the ASEAN  region continued to expand  at a robust pace in the 
fourth quarter, although performa nce varied across the region.  Real GDP rose solidly in 
Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia as domes tic demand strengthened and nominal trade 
balances remained high, suggesting strong real net exports.  In the Philippines, where the 
continued widening of the nominal trade defici t suggests that real net exports weakened, 
and in Thailand, where domestic demand wa s tepid, real GDP expanded at a more 
moderate pace.  More recentl y, January industrial production was up slig htly in Thailand, 
but down in Malaysia and Singapore. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation across the region continued to decline because of 
lower energy prices and, in some count ries, exchange rate appreciation and the 
unwinding of previous food price increases.  Citing the moderation in  inflation and the 
need to stimulate domestic demand, the centr al banks of Indonesia and Thailand further 
loosened monetary policy.  Specifically, Bank Indonesia cut interest rates by 25 basis 
points in early February and again in early  March, and the Bank of Thailand lowered 
rates 25 basis points in late February.   
 
The Bank of Thailand announced that, effectiv e mid-March, capital controls instituted 
last December will be loosened further.  In the Philippines, the central bank announced 
measures to liberalize capital outflows in an effort to stem currenc y appreciation; caps on 
foreign exchange purchases and outward invest ments by residents were  raised.  In early 
March, the central bank also approved a plan  to repay in May the country’s remaining 
Brady bond debt, estimated at $126 million; this action was made possible by the 
country’s improved fiscal position.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to a mark ed slowdown in the pace of economic 
activity.  Real GDP growth fell to  1.9 percent (a.r.) in the f ourth quarter.  Weakness in the 
manufacturing and mining sectors offset solid performances in construction, services, and 
agriculture.  Manufacturi ng exports to the United States d eclined, leading to a worsening 
of the trade balance in January.  Twelve-m onth headline inflation was 4.1 percent in 
February, the sixth consecutive month of inflation at or above the upper limit of the 
central bank’s 2 to 4 percent in flation target range.  The elevated inflation rate largely 
reflected high prices for corn tortillas.  Although the central bank left monetary policy 
unchanged during its late-February meeting, it warned of the need for policy tightening 
should inflation remain high.

In Brazil , real GDP grew 4.4 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, supported by strong 
private consumption and investment.  Conti nuing the pattern over the past year, net 
exports made a negative cont ribution to growth, as real exports declined a little and 
imports rose substantially.  In January, industrial output decl ined a bit and the 
unemployment rate edged up.  Consumer price in flation remained at about 3 percent on a

In late January, the Lula government unveiled a package of measures aimed at spurring 
investment, the first big initiative since Lula  began his second term earlier in the month.  
The package, which relies heavily on implic it and explicit subsidies to direct private 
investment to energy and other selected sect ors, has received mostly tepid reviews from 
economists.  In early March, the central bank lowered its target for the policy rate, the 
Selic rate, by 25 basis points, to 12¾ percent, bringing the cumulative decline in the rate 
to 700 basis points since the current ea sing phase began in September 2005.

In Argentina,  the index of economic activity (a  monthly proxy of GDP) through 
December suggests that output growth remained  strong in the fourth quarter.  Industrial 
production accelerated noticeably but fell back in January, largely reflecting the shutting 
down of motor vehicle plants fo r retooling.  This retooling does not occur in the same 
month every year, complicating seasonal adjust ment.  Twelve-month inflation in January 
and February came in a bit lower th an at the end of last year.

Venezuela  recorded its third straight year of double-digit growth, with real GDP soaring 
an estimated 22 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter.  Profligate fiscal and monetary 
policies fueled overall growth over the past year, but activ ity stagnated in the energy 
sector even as oil revenues remained elev ated.  Inflation has become a major economic 
and political problem.  Reported twelve-m onth consumer price inflation surpassed 
20 percent in February and may understate actual  inflation, as many food items that are in 
short supply because of price controls were excluded from the computation.   
 
As expected, the Chavez-cont rolled congress approved the Enabling Law on January 31, 
giving Chavez broad powers for the next 18 mo nths.  Chavez introduced new measures to 
tackle inflation, reducing the VAT on certain items and threatening to nationalize grocery 
stores and distribution comp anies that do not comply w ith price controls.  The 
nationalization of Electricidad de Car acas and CANTV (the nation’s largest 
telecommunications company) is proceeding, and Chavez decreed the nationalization of 
the rest of the electricity companies.  In  February, Argentina and Venezuela issued a 
second dollar-denominated “bond of the south”  for $1.5 billion, split equally between the 
two countries.   In early March, the gove rnment announced that the Bolivar will be 
replaced by the “Bolivar Fuerte” (Strong Bolivar) on January 1, 2008.  The Bolivar 
Fuerte is equal to 1,000 Bolivares.  The offi cial exchange rate is 2,144 Bolivares per 
dollar, but the exchange rate in the parall el market was over 3,800 Bolivares per dollar in 
mid-March.

In Turkey , economic activity slowed toward the end of 2006. Although trade and current 
account deficits improved on falling energy a nd commodity prices, industrial production 
fell markedly in December.  In January, the trade deficit widened again.  Notwithstanding 
lower energy prices and sluggi sh growth, inflation remains a concern with consumer 
prices up more than 10 percent over the twel ve months ended in February.  Upcoming 
elections raise the possibility  of expansionary fiscal policy, which, combined with 
generous public-sector wage increases, may fu el inflationary pressures further.  EU 
accession talks appear to have stalled indefinitely, reflecting co ntinued lack of progress in 
resolving issues related to Cyprus.

In South Africa , recent indicators point to a st rengthening of growth.  Real GDP 
increased 5.6 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quart er of last year, lead ing to a Q4/Q4 growth 
rate of more than 5 percent in 2006.  Ma nufacturing production was up nearly 2 percent 
in December over the previous month.  Tw elve-month consumer price inflation in 
January crept up to 5.3 percent, after several months at 5 pe rcent.  The current account 
deficit continued to widen as merchandise imports outpaced merchandise exports, though 
both are growing at near-record rates.
