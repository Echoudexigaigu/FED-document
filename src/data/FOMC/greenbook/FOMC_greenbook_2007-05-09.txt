Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The incoming data suggest that economic activ ity is continuing to expand at a below-
trend pace.  Payroll employment has conti nued to post solid gains, and manufacturing 
production stepped up in March after exhibiti ng considerable softne ss over the preceding 
several months.  However, housing constr uction remains under pressure from weak 
demand and outsized inventories of unsold homes, and consumer spending appears to 
have moved onto a slower growth track in recent months.  In addition, business fixed 
investment has remained subdued, although the exceptional weakness in some key 
categories of equipment spending may be startin g to dissipate.  Total PCE inflation was 
pushed up in March by rising energy prices, wh ile the twelve-month change in core PCE 
prices stood at 2.1 percent, just a tenth above the read ing for the preceding year. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand decelerated in the first quarter  but remained relatively strong.  Private 
nonfarm payroll employment increased an  average of 124,000 per month, about 40,000 
below the average pace recorded  in the fourth quarter of  2006.  The gains in private 
employment, in combination with a relatively  stable average workweek, contributed to a 
1.5 percent (annual rate) increase in a ggregate hours in the first quarter. 
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in 
March, to 4.4 percent, and the labor force participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent.  
The number of job losers unemployed less than five weeks as a percentage of 
employment—a proxy for the layoff rate—fe ll in March after ha ving spiked around the 
turn of the year.  Other indicators of labor demand have remain ed in a range consistent with moderate 
employment growth.  The four-week moving av erage of initial claims for unemployment 
insurance stood at 332,000 for the week endi ng April 21, just a bi t above its fourth-
quarter average.  Layoff announcements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and 
Christmas, have stayed relatively low.   According to Manpower and the National 
Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) , hiring plans have moved down recently 
but continue to occupy the favorable range that has prevailed si nce 2004.  Similarly, job 
openings and new hires, as reported by the Bu reau of Labor Statistics, edged down in 
February but remain at high levels.  Measures of labor market tightness suggest that  little has changed la tely.  The percentage 
of firms reporting to the NFIB that they ha d a hard-to-fill position was about flat in 
March and was about equal to the average le vel in 2006.  According to the Conference

Board, households’ assessments of job availa bility have not moved much in recent 
months.  Similarly, the number of indivi duals who remain on unemployment insurance 
rolls until their benefits expire (the  exhaustion rate) ha s changed little. 
 The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 1.5 percent in the first quarter.  This modest  gain would leave the rate of increase over 
the past four quarters at 1 per cent, 1 percentage point lower than the pace recorded during 
the preceding four quarters.

 Industrial Production  
Total industrial production (IP) rose 1.4 percent (annua l rate) in the first quarter after a 
similarly sized decline in the fourth quarte r.  The flattening out of production over the 
past two quarters reflected i nventory-related adjustments in  a variety of industries, 
including light motor vehicles, constructi on supplies, and severa l upstream materials 
industries, such as steel and semiconducto rs.  Although indicators of the inventory 
situation have been mixed, the bulk of th e evidence suggests that businesses have 
significantly reduced—though proba bly not eliminated—the ove rhangs that cropped up 
in late 2006.  In March, IP declined 0.2 percen t after a considerable rise in February; the change in IP 
in March was reduced ¾ percentage point by a steep drop in utilities output because of a 
sizable swing in weather conditions from unseas onably cold temperatures in February to

unseasonably mild temperatures in March.  In the manufactur ing sector, production 
increased 0.7 percent in Marc h after having declined, on bala nce, over the previous six 
months.  The gains in manufacturing IP in March were spread widely and pushed up the 
factory operating rate 0.4 per centage point, to 80.1 percent,  a level 0.3 percentage point 
above its 1972–2006 average.  The limited weekly information on IP for Apr il suggests that the to tal index was likely 
boosted by an increase in electricity output  and the scheduled pickup in motor vehicle 
assemblies; weekly data on output in other industries—principally crude oil, petroleum 
refining, steel, and meat products—appear likely  to have been a small drag on balance. 
 The output of high-tech industries rose more th an 3 percent in March after several months 
of sluggish gains.  Much of the weakness earlier in the quarter  reflected declining 
semiconductor production as manufacturers mo ved to correct inventory imbalances that 
arose when cell phone sales softened unexp ectedly and as the accumulation of chips 
needed for the roll-out of computers runni ng the new Microsoft Vi sta operating system 
ran its course.
1  Although semiconductor inventories a ppear to have remained elevated 
throughout the quarter, production turned up in March.  Intel’s latest revenue guidance 
points to a moderate increas e in microprocessor production in the second quarter. 
 Elsewhere in the high-tech sect or, production accelerated during the first quarter.  Gartner 
reports that faster gains in the production of computers were related to the release of the 
consumer version of Microsoft Vista, which had led some buyers to delay purchases until 
this year.  On the business side, sales of  small servers moved up smartly, but production 
of large servers decelerated, a move that Gartner attributes to a nearly completed 
replacement cycle.  The out put of communications equipm ent rose 30 percent (annual 
rate) in the first quarte r, a marked step-up from the sec ond half of last year.  However, 
this rate of increase in producti on is not likely to continue fo r much longer in light of the 
relatively moderate increase in capital expenditures planned by telecommunication 
service providers (TSPs) this year.

1 Microsoft Vista requires a more complex, and more expensive, mix of hardware, particularly 
semiconductors. 
2 TSPs account for less than 20 percent of domestic production of communications equipment, but 
because TSP spending is volatile, it accounts for a relatively large share of changes in investment in, and 
production of, communications equipment.

II-11 
The production of motor vehicles and parts fe ll 8½ percent in th e first quarter, as 
assemblies sank to their lowest level since the third quarter of 1993.  However, with 
inventories back down to desira ble levels at the end of th e quarter, assemblies of light 
vehicles are estimated to have picked up to an annual rate of about 11 million units in 
April and are scheduled to remain at about this level in May and June.  Despite the 
sizable increase in production, days’ supply of light vehicles should remain in check this 
quarter if sales remain close to the first-quarter pace.3  Meanwhile, production of medium 
and heavy trucks has continued to move lowe r in response to a falloff in demand after the 
new EPA regulations went into  effect earlier this year. 
 Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, a nd high-tech products, output rose in March 
in nearly all of the major ma rket groups.  The production of consumer goods increased 
½ percent:  Continued strength in nondurables accompanied a sm all gain in durables that 
followed weak production earlier in the quart er.  The output of business equipment rose 
0.8 percent in March, thereby partly reversing declines over the pr evious two months.  
The production of construction supplies popped up in March, though it remained well 
below levels observed from late 2005 to mi d-2006; the March gain was likely due, at 
least in part, to unseasonably warm weather.  The output of materials rose 0.6 percent, a 
move that likely reflects the recent rise in construction supplies and the upturn in motor 
vehicle assemblies in April.  The only majo r market group that declined in March was 
defense and space equipment, which was pulled down by a one-month strike at a 
Northrop Grumman shipyard in  Pascagoula, Mississippi. 
 Near-term indicators suggest modest production gains in coming months.  In April, the 
new orders diffusion index from the Instit ute for Supply Management (ISM) jumped, 
while the corresponding indexes from the various regional surv eys were little changed on 
balance.  In addition, a variet y of materials-related industr ies—such as primary metals 
and plastics and rubber products—should benef it from the scheduled step-up in motor 
vehicle assemblies this quarter.  However, th e staff’s series on real adjusted durable 
goods orders has declined, on balance,  since the end of last summer. 
                                                
 
3 Given net imports of about 5½ million units and sales of about 16½ million units, replacement-level 
production—the amount of production needed to keep inventories unchanged—would be about 11 million 
units, a level roughly in line with industry schedules for the second quarter.  In the past three quarters, 
production was far below replacement levels, and inventories declined.

Light Motor Vehicles  
Sales of automobiles and light trucks averag ed an annual rate of 16½ million units in the 
first quarter, a little above the pace in the fourth  quarter of last year and the same as that 
over 2006 as a whole.   
 
.4  In April, sales declined a bit,  mainly because of lower sales of 
foreign-produced vehicles.  As a result, the Big Three’s domestic market share moved 
back up to its level of last year. 
 The Conference Board measure of new car purchases improved in April, while the 
Reuters/University of Michigan index of car-buying attitudes remained in the neutral 
range seen over the past several months.  According to the Reuters/Michigan survey, high gasoline prices are not as bi g a deterrent to car buying as  they were in 2006, although 
respondents to recent surveys have expresse d concern about higher financing rates.  
Manufacturers’ pricing incentives for light vehi cles remained at a relatively low level in 
April.  
Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumption expenditures increase d at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the 
first quarter, but spending growth slowed over the course of the quarter, in part because 
of swings in weather-relate d outlays on energy goods (suc h as fuel oil) and energy 
services (such as natural gas and electricit y).  Real spending on goods other than motor 
vehicles, which had shown exceptional vigo r late last year, was little changed, on 
balance, between December and March.  However, real outlays on non-energy services were reported to have posted soli d gains, especially in March. 
 Consumer spending appears to have entered the second quarter on a soft note.  Chain store sales were up just a little, on balance, in  recent weeks.  In addition, the Conference 
Board and the Reuters/Michigan surveys report ed small declines in consumer confidence 
in April, perhaps because of the run-up in  gasoline prices.  Even so, both sentiment 
measures remain consistent with modest  gains in spending in the near term. 
 With regard to the fundamentals, real dispos able personal income rose at an annual rate 
of 4½ percent in the first quarter.  Although roug hly half of this gain reflects an estimate 
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of unusually large bonus payments and stock 
option exercises in January, wages and salaries increased solidly, on average, over

February and March.  Consumer spending has also continued to draw support from the 
increases in household wealth that have o ccurred over the past two years, although the 
boost to spending from wealth has likely been offset to some extent by the lagged effects 
of the upward trend in borrowing costs since 2004 .  In the first quarter of this year, the 
wealth-income ratio likely ticked down, as the stock market rose  only a little and house 
prices remained soft.  However, much of the lost ground has probably since been made 
up as a result of the surge in stock prices in April. 
 The personal saving rate averaged negative 1 pe rcent in the first quarter after having been 
in the vicinity of negative 1¼ percent to negative 1½ percent over the preceding three 
quarters.  All else being equal, this yea r’s annual retail sales revision implies a small 
downward adjustment to consumer spending an d a small upward adjustment to the saving 
rate in recent years.  The revi sion is expected to raise the saving rate in the first quarter 
about ¼ percentage point, but it is not expe cted to significantly a lter its patte rn over the 
past few quarters.  
Housing  
Residential construction activity remains soft overall as builders attempt to work off an 
elevated inventory of unsold new homes.  R ecent readings on home sales suggest that 
housing demand has continued to weaken, a nd the tightening of lending standards for 
nonprime borrowers that began in February will likely further restrain home sales in the 
coming months.  Single-family housing starts rose 2 percent in March, and adjusted perm it issuance in this 
sector increased.  Unusually warm and dry w eather almost certainly boosted the level of 
single-family starts in March; it may have raised permit issuance as well.  Although the 
correlation between permit issuance and weathe r patterns is not typically strong, the only 
increases in the number of permits issued since September 2005 have been in January 
2006, December 2006, and March 2007—all months that were unseasonably warm.  The incoming data on home sales are sending mixed signals about th e current tenor of 
housing demand.  Although existing home sale s declined in March, that drop followed 
sizable increases in January and February, and the level of sale s in March was only 
slightly below the steady pace that prevailed in the second half of 2006.  New home sales 
present a considerably less sangui ne view of demand:  They fell sharply in the first two 
months of the year and recove red only a bit in March, developments that left their level 
about 14 percent below the average of  the second half of last year.

The recent tightening of lending standards may have exerted some restraint on new home 
sales in March, and it will likely show up in th e existing home sales statistics (which are 
based on closings) in the second quarter.  Th e decline in the pending home sales index in 
March may partly reflect reduced sales to  nonprime borrowers.  The four-week moving 
average of the MBA index of mortgage purchas e applications has also slipped a little 
since the end of February.5  However, in contrast to the difficulties faced by nonprime 
borrowers and lenders, relatively low mort gage rates should help to support housing 
demand among prime borrowers:  The average rate  for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is 
currently about 60 basis points below the level of last Jul y, while average rates for one-
year adjustable-rate mortgages are about 30 basis points lower. 
 Combined with a large remaining inventory of new homes for sale , the contraction in 
new home sales has noticeably raised the months’ supply of new homes for sale.  
Relative to the three-month average pace of sa les, the months’ supply in March was more 
than 60 percent above the high end of the re latively narrow range it occupied from 1997 
to 2005.  Moreover, these published figures probably understate the true inventory 
overhang in this sector because they do not acco unt for last year’s surge in canceled sales, 
which return homes to the unsold inventory but are not incorporated in the official 
statistics.  High inventories and low sales in  March suggest that homebuilders may have 
to reduce their construction pl ans even further to work o ff their excess in ventories of 
unsold homes.  House-price appreciation conti nues to slow.  On a constant -quality basis, the average 
price of new homes was 5 percent above year- earlier levels in the first quarter, compared 
with an average annual increase of nearly 7 percent in the preced ing three years.  
Furthermore, these figures may understate the actual decelerati on in the cost to 
purchasers of new homes because homebuilders have reportedly stepped up their use of 
nonprice measures—such as granting more-fa vorable mortgage terms, paying closing 
costs, and including optional upgr ades at no cost—to bolster sa les and unload inventory.  
For existing homes, the Case-Shiller home-price index—which uses a methodology 
similar to that of the OFHEO index but is limited to sales in ten large U.S. cities—has decelerated substantially since last summer, slipping further in the first two months of 
this year, and pointing to so me further deceleration in the OFHEO index in the first  
                                                
 
5 Although the sample used to calculate the MB A index does not include a large fraction of the 
institutions that deal with subprime borrowers, the reduced housing demand of this group may still affect 
the index by making it more difficult for all current homeowners to sell their homes when they want to 
move.

quarter.  Meanwhile, the average price of exis ting homes sold—which does not adjust for 
changes in the quality of homes—moved down in March to a level that was 1.1 percent 
below that of a year earlier.  
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) rose at an annual rate of less than 
2 percent last quarter after having fallen 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter.  Spending on 
high-tech equipment posted a s ubstantial increase in the firs t quarter.  But spending on 
transportation equipment was dragged down by a plunge in purchases of medium and 
heavy trucks.  Outlays outside these categor ies continued to cont ract steeply, though the 
upturn in shipments and orders  in March may be a signal that equipment spending is 
starting to improve as we move into the second quarter.  To be sure, the fundamental determinants of equipment spending have turned less supportive in recent quarters in light of the sharp deceleration in business output.  But 
with robust corporate cash rese rves and with the user cost of high-tech goods continuing 
to decline, the fundamentals in  the aggregate are still consis tent with a faster underlying 
pace of equipment spending than  has been seen in recent quarters.  In addition, the 
deterioration in surveys of business conditions  that was evident in  2006 appears to have 
ended; in fact, the ISM index has rebounded lately. 
 Real spending on high-tech E&S expanded at an  annual rate of 20 percent last quarter, 
and sharp gains were observed in all major categ ories.  Real outlays on computers rose at 
an annual rate of more than 50 percent, in pa rt because of the reta il release of Microsoft 
Vista in January.  As noted, the IP index for computers—the majo r input into the BEA 
estimate of computer spending—increased significantly in the first quarter, and 
shipments and imports also posted solid gains.
6  The BEA advance estimate of spending 
on software, which is based in part on outlays  for computers, also showed a substantial 
increase—in fact, anecdotal reports on compa ny earnings point to an  even larger number 
than the BEA estimate.  In addition, purchases of communications equipment—which tend to be volatile quarter to quart er—sped up after a fourth-quarter dip. 
                                                
 
6 Note that the BEA estimate of business investment  in computers last quarter was biased upward 
because the BEA uses the overall  IP index for computers, which includes both business spending and 
consumer spending, while the Vista-related surge in sales of computers was pr imarily associ ated with 
consumer purchases.

Real business outlays on tran sportation equipment declined  at an annual rate of 
13½ percent last quarter.  Although domestic  spending on aircraft jumped after three 
weak quarters, spending on motor vehicles cont racted significantly as the tightening of 
emissions standards that took effect in Janua ry led to a dramatic drop in purchases of 
medium and heavy trucks.  Another sharp dec line in truck orders in  March suggests that 
these purchases will fall furt her in the second quarter. 
 Business investment in equipment other than  high-tech and trans portation dropped at an 
annual rate of 8 percent in the first quarter af ter a fall of nearly 5 pe rcent in the previous 
quarter.  The weakness in this broad category appears to have been especially pronounced 
around the turn of the year and to have lessene d somewhat over the cour se of the quarter.  
In March, shipments of cons truction and motor-vehicle-related equipment (such as 
metalworking machinery and construction machin ery), which had played a major role in 
the earlier weakness, continued to decrease.  Orders for these items rose sharply as a 
result of a surprising jump in bookings for construction machinery.  That said, reports 
from our contacts suggest that demand for construction-related m achinery and supplies 
remains weak.  Outside of construction a nd motor vehicles, orders and shipments both 
posted widespread—albeit modest—gains in March.  
Nonresidential Construction  
Real outlays for nonresidential construction excluding drilling  and mining regained some 
steam in the first quarter after having hit a lu ll in late 2006:  After incorporating data on 
construction spending in March, we estimate that they rose at an annual rate of 
12 percent.
7  The fundamentals in this sector remain solid and point  to further increases in 
the near term, although they will likely be smalle r than that recorded in  the first quarter of 
this year.  Vacancy rates in the industrial and office categories have moved down over the 
past few years.  In the retail sector, the v acancy rate has drifted up since the end of 2005 
but remains well below its peak in 2002.  Furt hermore, the architectural billings index—
which is correlated with changes in nonresid ential construction a bout six months hence—
rebounded in the second half of last year.8 
 Real drilling and mining investment dropped sharply in the first quarter; this decrease 
continued a deceleration in activity that began in the second half of last year and may  
                                                
 
7 The advance NIPA estimate, which did not include data on construction spending in March, showed 
an increase of 7½ percent for these outlays. 
8 About 88 percent of the construction projects co vered by the architectural billings index are 
nonresidential.

partly reflect the net decline in energy pri ces since last summer.  In April, the total 
number of drilling rigs in  operation was flat, suggesti ng that drilling and mining 
investment did not change significan tly early in the second quarter. 
 
Business Inventories  
After factoring in the most recent informa tion on manufacturing inventories, we estimate 
that real nonfarm inventory i nvestment excluding motor vehicl es increased at an annual 
rate of $27 billion in the firs t quarter, $13 billion less than in the fourth quarter of 2006.9  
The apparent downshift in inve ntory investment has helped to reduce the overhangs that 
emerged in late 2006, although the available m easures provide conflicting signals on how 
much progress has been made to date.  The ra tio of book-value inventor ies to sales in the 
manufacturing and trade sector  (excluding motor vehicles) was little changed between 
September and February, and the ratio for the manufacturing sector remained elevated in 
March.  In contrast, information from the st aff’s flow-of-goods inve ntory system suggests 
that the run-up in days’ supply was reversed by the end of March, la rgely eliminating the 
overhangs.  In addition, the ISM customers’ inventories index remained below 50 for a 
second month in April, indicating that the net number of firms who vi ew the level of their 
customers’ inventories as too high has dropped back from its elevated readings over the 
previous two quarters.  
Federal Government Sector  
Incoming data suggest that the federal unified budget deficit continues to narrow, but that 
revenue growth may be moderating a bit from the fast pace of recent years.  The moderation in revenues has primarily been c oncentrated in corporate payments, which 
appear to have decelerated af ter a period of very rapid increases.  Indeed, the 12 percent 
rise in corporate receipts in March was only about half the si ze of the gains seen over the 
past year.
10  And according to daily Treasury data, corporate receipts in April, which are 
essentially the first quarterly estimates on 2007 liabilities, were no hi gher than they were 
in April 2006, consistent with an easing in pr ofits growth.  In cont rast, individual income 
tax and social insurance collections remained strong in the first quart er.  In addition, daily 
Treasury data point to another solid increase in withheld i ndividual and social insurance 
taxes in April.  Nonwithheld individual in come tax payments in April and early May— 
                                                 
9 This estimate is $3 billion smaller than the BEA advance estimate because it incorporates data for 
manufacturing inventories in March, which were unava ilable at the time of the advance release of first-
quarter GDP. 
10 The March collections are largely final payments on 2006 liability.  When they are combined with 
earlier payments, they indicate that corporate income tax liabilities rose about 20 percent in 2006, the same 
as the NIPA measure of  taxable book profits.

which are largely net final payments on 2006 liabilities—were running around 15 percent 
higher than a year earlier.  Federal outlays in March were  5½ percent above their year -earlier level as defense 
spending continued to fall short of expectations.  The level of  defense spending in recent 
months has been low compared with fiscal-y ear projections by the Ad ministration; it has 
also been below projections from the C ongressional Budget Office that assume 
enactment of an additional $100 billion in budget authority for defense in fiscal 2007.  In 
the NIPA, real federal spending fell at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, as a 
6½ percent (annual rate) drop in real defense expenditures more than offset a moderate 
increase in nondefense purchases.  On the legislative front, the Congress passed a $124 billion supplemen tal near the end of 
April, of which about $100 billion was for the Department of Defense.  It was vetoed by 
President Bush, and a revised bi ll is currently in the works.  We believe that the weakness 
in defense outlays in the first quarter reflects the usual volatility of these purchases and is 
not attributable to the delay in enacting th e supplemental.  Nonetheless, some reports 
have suggested that spending may be constraine d in the second quarter  if these additional 
funds are not enacted soon.  
State and Local Government Sector  
Consistent with the sector’s generally favorable financial situation, near-term indicators 
suggest brisk growth in the state and local gov ernment sector in the first quarter of this 
year.  Real construction outlays rose at an annual rate of a bout 10 percent, and 
employment increased 25,000 per month, on av erage—similar to th e relatively strong 
pace of hiring in 2006.  After factoring in th e March construction data, we estimate that 
real state and local purchases increased at an annual rate of 4 percen t in the first quarter, 
compared with a rise of 3¼ percen t in the advance NIPA release. 
 State and local revenue inflows have remained  fairly robust but have decelerated a bit 
from the torrid pace in 2005.  According to the Census Bureau, state tax revenues posted 
another sizable increase in the fourth quarter of 2006, a nd the National Conference of 
State Legislators reported that revenues are coming in above e xpectations in many states.  
At the local level, property tax receipts ha ve continued to rise  rapidly despite the 
deceleration in house values and the increas ing political pressure to reduce property 
taxes; in 2006, twenty-two states moved to reduce property tax colle ctions, and virtually 
all ballot measures for prope rty tax relief were approved by voters.  The continued

strength in property tax revenue  likely reflects the fact that  many localities are subject to 
state limits on the annual increases in tota l property tax payments and property value 
assessments; thus, they may continue to e xperience rising revenues from property taxes 
for another few years as tax bills catch up to  the earlier increases in market prices. 
 
Prices  
The total PCE price index rose 0.4 percent in March after a sim ilar increase in February.  
The March increase was driven largely by an in crease of more than 6 percent in the price 
of energy, while the February increase was more  broadly distributed across categories.  
On a twelve-month-change basis, PCE pri ce inflation was 2.4 percent in March, down 
0.5 percentage point from a year earlier; a deceleration in energy prices more than 
accounted for the reduction.  Core PCE prices were unchanged in March af ter a 0.3 percent increas e in February; over 
the past three months, these prices have rise n at an annual pace of 2.4 percent.  The low 
March reading was largely the result of fl at prices for medical services, which had 
increased sharply in the previous two months , and a decline in the prices for apparel, 
which tend to be especially volatile this time of  year.  On balance, price increases in other 
categories were also a touch lower than in other recent months, most notably in lodging away from home, tobacco, and various non-motor-vehicle-related durable goods.  
Smoothing through the high-frequency movements,  the twelve-month change in the core 
PCE price index was 2.1 percent in March, just  a touch higher than the increase over the 
year-earlier period.  Over the twelve months ending in March, the core CPI accelerated noticeably more than the core PCE price measure.  Accelerations in  the costs of housing and medical services 
have pushed up both measures over the past ye ar.  Taking account of the relative weights 
in the two series, housing costs have had an especially large effect on the CPI, while 
medical costs have had an especially large effect on the PCE measure.  However, the 
acceleration in core PCE pri ce has been muted by a deceleration in its nonmarket 
portion—in fact, market-based core PCE price inflation has increased nearly as much as 
core CPI inflation over the past year.  The energy component of the PCE price index increased substantially in March after a 
much smaller rise in February.  The tw elve-month change in energy prices was 
3½ percent, appreciably less than the 17 percen t rise during the preceding twelve months.  
The March increase in energy prices was driv en by a 10½ percent jump in the price for

motor fuel, although prices for natural gas a nd heating fuel also rose noticeably.  
Inventories of gasoline have tumbled since th e early part of the year because of high 
demand and both scheduled and unscheduled refinery outages.  In response to the 
inventory declines, gasoline margins have  increased significantly over the past few 
months.  In part for this reason, available su rvey data point to a continued increase in 
motor fuel prices during April.  The PCE price index for food and beverages ro se 0.3 percent in Marc h after much more 
rapid increases in the previous  two months.  Compared with  twelve months earlier, food 
prices were up 3¼ percent, a step-up from  the 2½ percent increase over the preceding 
twelve-month period.  Prices for meat have risen appreciably in recent months, likely 
because of higher costs for feed, most notab ly corn.  Since the end of March, however, 
corn prices have retreated somewhat on ne ws of a considerable increase in acreage 
intended for planting.  However, freeze damage  affecting winter wheat and some fruit 
crops in the South may boost food prices in the next few months. 
 Broader measures of inflation show a slowing of inflation relative to  four quarters ago.  
Despite the small increase in core PCE pri ce inflation, the price index for GDP less food 
and energy decelerated, reflecting slower ra tes of increase in the prices for other 
components of final demand, especially construction.  As measured by the Reuters/Michigan index, the median expectation for year-ahead inflation moved up ¼ percentage point in April, to 3.3 percent.  This step-up is consistent 
with the larger, energy-driven increases in overa ll consumer prices of late.  Median five- 
to ten-year expectations have  moved up 0.2 percentage point, to  3.1 percent, but this level 
is still in the narrow range seen over the pa st few years.  Inflation compensation from 
TIPS is about 0.1 percentage point higher than at the time of the March Greenbook. 
 At earlier stages of processi ng, the producer price index (PPI) for core intermediate goods 
increased just 0.2 percent for a second month in March.  Ov er the twelve months ending 
in March, the index for core intermediate ma terials increased 3½ pe rcent, 1¼ percentage 
points less than the year-earlier increase.  Part  of this slowdown reflected a deceleration 
in the prices for a number of energy-intens ive goods, such as industrial chemicals and 
plastics.  
Commodity prices continue to  trend upward.  The Commodity  Research Bureau’s spot 
index of industrial materials is up 3¾ percent since the March Greenbook, and the

Journal of Commerce  index of industrial materials has risen 3½ percent.  Strong 
international demand has helped drive up metals  prices, which conti nue to contribute to 
the rise in both indexes.  
Labor Costs  
Measures of hourly compensation have been heavily influenced by special factors—as 
well as by a good deal of noise—in recent quarter s.  But smoothing through the volatility 
in the data, the underlying pace of comp ensation gains seems to have picked up 
somewhat.  To be sure, the employment cost  index (ECI) for private industry workers 
rose at an annual rate of just 2¼ percen t over the three months ending in March.  
However, the low reading stemmed largely from a sharp drop in contributions to 
retirement plans as the strong performance of the stock market in 2006, along with a high 
level of employer contributions over the past several years, boosted the funding levels of 
defined-benefit plans and allowed firms to lo wer their payments to these plans in early 
2007.  Even with the very small increase fo r the three months ending in March, the 
twelve-month change in the ECI moved up to 3¼ percent, ½ percenta ge point more than 
the increase over the preceding twelve months.  In contrast to the performance of benefits, the wages and salaries component of the ECI 
picked up noticeably in March.  The three-m onth increase in wages—which was at an 
annual rate of 4¼ percent—was the largest in several years, and it lifted the twelve-month 
change in this series to 3½ percent, 1¼ pe rcentage points more than the increase over the 
year-earlier period.  Averag e hourly earnings for producti on or nonsupervisory workers 
have also accelerated over th e past couple of years, alt hough the rate of increase shows 
some signs of leveling out in recent months:  Over the twelve months ending in March, 
average hourly earnings increased 4 percent, ½ percentage point more than a year earlier.  
 Like the ECI, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business as measured in the Productivity and Costs (P&C) rel ease appears to have moved up only a little in the first 
quarter—indeed, using the most recent NIPA data , we estimate that this measure rose at 
an annual rate of just 1¾ per cent after an increase of more than 8 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2006.  This pattern reflects the BEA’s incorporation of an assumed $50 billion 
in bonus payments and stock options into its es timate of wage and sa lary accruals in the

11 As noted in the Consumer Spending section, the bonuses were paid—and showed up as wage and 
salary disbursements—in the first quarter of 2007.  However, the BEA assumed that the bonuses represented remuneration for productive activity in the four th quarter of 2006 and thus imputed them to that 
period's compensation bill.  In any event, note that the BEA will not have actual source data for wage and 
salary disbursements in the first quarter until August.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Over the intermeeting period, financial market s largely recovered from the turbulence 
that preceded the March meeting of the FOMC .  On net, investors pushed up somewhat 
the expected path of monetary policy beyond the near term.  Market participants now 
expect between 75 basis points and 100 basis points of easing by th e end of 2008, a little 
less than at the time of the March FOMC mee ting.  On balance, nominal Treasury yields 
edged up slightly along the term structure.   Inflation compensation based on Treasury 
inflation-protected securities (TI PS) were little changed even as  oil prices rose markedly.  
Equity prices climbed steeply amid solid ea rnings reports and improved sentiment, more 
than reversing the declines in the prev ious intermeeting period.  Risk spreads on 
investment-grade corporate bonds were abou t unchanged, while sp reads on speculative-
grade corporate bonds narrowed somewhat.  Delinquency rates on subprime variable-rate 
home mortgages remained elevated, but ra tes for the much larger group of prime 
borrowers stayed low.  
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Market participants largely anticipated th e FOMC’s decision at its March meeting to 
leave the target federal funds  rate unchanged.  Nevertheless, the expected path for 
monetary policy moved lower on the announcem ent, as investors apparently were 
surprised by the somewhat softer tone of the description of econo mic conditions in the 
accompanying statement, and by the replacement of the reference to “additional firming” with language that was interpreted as more ba lanced.  However, data releases, sent mixed 
signals and short-term interest  rates rose a little, as s ubsequent FOMC communications—
including the Chairman’s testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, speeches by 
various FOMC members, and the minutes  of the March meeting—were seen as 
emphasizing the Committee’s concern about  upside risks to inflation.  Market 
participants attach only a small probability to a cut in the target federal funds rate at the 
May FOMC meeting.  Beyond the near term, i nvestors pushed up somewhat the expected 
path of monetary policy.  Ma rket participants now seem to anticipate between 75 basis 
points and 100 basis points of policy easing by the end of 2008, a little less than at the 
time of the March FOMC meeting.  Option-implied measures of market uncertain ty about the path of  policy were little 
changed over the intermeeting pe riod and remained within recent historical ranges.  
Implied probability distributions for the target  funds rate between six and twelve months 
ahead remained skewed toward lower rates.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on nomi nal Treasury securities edged up at all 
maturities.  On net, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead were little changed despite a significant rise in oil prices. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Over the intermeeting period, broad stock pri ce indexes climbed about  5 percent.  The 
rise was driven by solid first-quarter ear nings reports, which mostly exceeded 
expectations.  Overall market sentiment also seemed to improve some because of reduced 
anxiety about spillovers from problems in th e subprime mortgage market.  Equity prices 
rose in most industries, although energy firm s outperformed the broader market.  Implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 gene rally trended lower and is now only a little above the 
historically low levels that prevailed early this year.  The spread between the twelve-
month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury 
yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk pr emium—narrowed a touch but remained within 
its range over the past few years.    Over the intermeeting period, yields on inve stment-grade corporate bonds rose in line 
with those on comparable-maturity Treasury s ecurities, and so their spreads were little 
changed at fairly low levels.  Meanwhile, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
narrowed about 25 basis points.  Spreads on bonds for five investment banks with 
reported exposure to the subprime mortgage market—all of which carry an investment-
grade rating—remained slightly above the levels that prevailed earlier this year.    
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
On the basis of reports from more than 300 comp anies, earnings per share for firms in the 
S&P 500 are estimated to have increased 9 pe rcent through the year ending in the first 
quarter—the first single-digit rate of increase since 2003.  A further deceleration in 
corporate earnings had been widely anticipate d, and, indeed, more than  the usual share of 
company reports exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  Through mid-April, analysts seem to have made just small revisions to forecasts of year-ahead earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole.  Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to be solid.  Balance sheet 
liquidity ticked up from an alr eady elevated level in the fourth quarter, while aggregate 
corporate leverage remained low.  In Ma rch, the volume of bond upgrades significantly 
outpaced that of downgrades, and the realized  six-month trailing bond default rate stayed 
near zero.  In the fourth quarter of last  year, the delinquency rate on C&I loans at 
commercial banks was the lowest in more th an a decade.  The near-term outlook for

Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial  corporations slowed in Ap ril from its torrid first-
quarter pace.  Acquisition-rela ted financing has continued to  fuel the issuance of both 
investment- and speculative-grade corpor ate bonds.  Commercial paper outstanding 
declined last month, but C&I loans accelerat ed, a pattern broadly consistent with the 
easing of some terms on such loans that was reported in the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey.  Overall, net debt financi ng in April was well below the volume in the 
first quarter.    Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corp orations was tepid again in April.  The 
calendar of planned offerings suggests that  the pace of IPOs will pick up in coming 
months.  Private equity issuance is estimated to  have increased a bit in the first quarter, as 
leveraged buyout activity continued to clim b.  Even so, given that estimated share 
repurchases and actual retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions continued at near-record levels , equity retirements likely dwarfed total issuance again in 
the first quarter.    
Commercial Real Estate  
Total commercial mortgage borrowing has likely remained robust so far this year, as 
indicated by the pace of commercial-mortga ge-backed securities (CMBS) issuance.  
Gross CMBS issuance was quite strong in th e first quarter, and the issuance calendar 
points to a similar pace in the current quarter.    Spreads on BBB-rated CMBS have soared since la te February, reportedly in part because 
of reduced demand for collaterali zed debt obligations, which, in  recent years, have been 
large purchasers of these tranches of CM BS.  Rising leverage in pools of commercial 
mortgages underlying CMBS may also have been a factor in the recent widening in 
spreads.  The share of newly securitized comm ercial mortgages with loan-to-value ratios 
at or above 0.8 has increased significantly over th e past several months.  In response, 
rating agencies recently announced plans to in crease the level of credit support required 
for CMBS.  Despite the greater leverage, in creases in commercial property rents have 
kept the ratio of mortgage payments to re ntal income on newly securitized commercial 
mortgages within its range of the past seve ral years.  In March, delinquency rates on 
CMBS remained very low.

Increases in commercial property prices in the first quarter led to a further decline in the 
ratio of net operating income to property prices .  The spread of this  ratio over the real 
perpetuity Treasury yield—a rough measure of  the risk premium on commercial real 
estate assets—declined in the first qu arter to its lowest  level since 1992.   
 
Household Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, in terest rates available to pr ime borrowers for thirty-year 
fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate mort gages increased slightly, and for both, the 
spreads over Treasuries were little changed.  The growth of home mortgage debt likely 
slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home price a ppreciation appears to have 
remained sluggish.  Growth of consumer cred it continued to be m oderate early in the 
year.   The most recent data continued to show very low delinquency rates on prime and subprime fixed-rate mortgages.  However, in  March, delinquencies on subprime variable-
rate mortgages were roughly unchanged at hi gh levels.  Foreclosures  started on properties 
climbed in the fourth quarter; all told, we estimate that about 1 million properties began 
the foreclosure process in 2006.  A substant ial increase in the subprime segment has 
accounted for most of the increase in new foreclosures overall.  
 Respondents to the April Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey reported having tightened 
standards on residential mortgages over the past three months, particularly for 
nontraditional and subprime loans.  Spreads on indexes of subprime mortgage credit default swaps remained in the elevated range  that has prevailed si nce late February.  
Spreads for newly issued securities used to  fund subprime mortgage pools also stayed 
elevated as investors continue to scrutinize pools more closely. 
 The handful of monthly indicator s of home prices available fo r the first quarter suggest a 
very small aggregate price increase.  The traj ectory of expected home prices in ten of the 
largest metropolitan markets, derived from futures quotes on the S&P/Case-Shiller home-
price index, was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period and continues to 
imply an expectation of modera te price declines in these ma rkets over 2007.  On balance, 
the combination of solid stock market retu rns and sluggish home-price appreciation has 
left the ratio of household ne t worth to disposable persona l income at a relatively high 
level in recent quarters.  Pr opelled by strong inflows to both equity and bond funds, net 
inflows to long-term mutual funds have been a pproaching record levels so far this year.

Treasury and Agency Finance 
Nonwithheld federal receipts have been ve ry strong this tax s eason, and the Treasury 
scaled back regular issuance of bill and coupon securities in anticipation of further strong 
revenues.  During the intermeeting period, th e Treasury auctioned two- and five-year 
nominal securities as well as five-year TIPS and reopened January’s ten-year TIPS 
offering; most issues were well received.  At its mid-quarter refunding, the Treasury 
announced that it was discontinuing issuance of the three-year nominal note—a move 
that most primary dealers reportedly had an ticipated.  The propor tion of the issues 
awarded to indirect bidders—a rough gauge  of interest by foreign investors—was 
somewhat below recent values, while custody holdings by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York on behalf of foreign official inst itutions edged up over the intermeeting period.  
Although secondary-market volumes were subdue d last month, bid-ask spreads were in 
normal range, and markets functioned well.  Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s stock prices rose over the intermeeting period even as 
the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Ov ersight continued to express concerns over 
internal controls at the government-sponsor ed enterprises (GSEs)  and as regulatory-
reform legislation moved ahead in the Congres s.  However, yields on long-term agency 
debt fell slightly relative to those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, and GSE 
credit default swap spreads held steady. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds slowed in April from the rapid first-quarter 
pace.  Advance refundings, which surged in March because of a drop in interest rates, decelerated last month.  New capital issuance also moderated in April; the bulk of the 
proceeds were targeted to support spending on education and transportation.  Short-term 
issuance was negligible last month, a developm ent consistent with healthy state and local 
budgets and the typical seasonal pattern.  Th e credit quality of municipal bonds remained 
solid, as the number of b ond-rating upgrades continued to outpace the number of 
downgrades.  The ratio of municipal bond yi elds to those on comparable Treasury 
securities remained at the low end of its range over the past decade. 
 
Money and Bank Credit  
M2 accelerated to an average annual growth rate of 9 per cent during March and April.  
The acceleration was due primarily to faster growth in liquid deposits, which were likely 
boosted in April by tax-related flows.  Retail money market funds surged at the beginning 
of March after the turbulence in  financial markets in late February, but flows slowed in

April.  In both March and April, sma ll time deposits expanded moderately, while 
currency continued to grow slowly, la rgely because of soft foreign demand. 
 Growth of commercial bank credit continued to be solid during Ma rch and April but was 
down a bit from earlier in the year.  The slow down primarily reflected reduced lending to 
households, most notably a contraction in resi dential real estate loans on banks’ books.  
However, the runoff in residential real estate loans was attributable, in part, to sales of such loans to nonbank institutions—transactions th at frequently cause large swings in this 
category of loans.  Adjusted for securitizations , consumer loans have also slowed of late.  
The pace of lending to businesses picked up a bit, on balance, as C&I loans accelerated 
and commercial real estate loan s continued to expand briskly.

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
 
The April 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  In li ght of recent developments in the subprime 
mortgage market, banks were queried sep arately about standards on and demand for 
prime, nontraditional, and subprime residentia l mortgages.  This appendix is based on 
responses from fifty-one domestic banks a nd nineteen foreign banking institutions. 
 Overall, the respondent banks reported mixe d changes in lending standards and terms 
over the past three months and somewhat weaker demand for most loan types.  Domestic and foreign institutions indicated that they had eased terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the past thr ee months and that credit standards on such 
loans had changed little.  Domestic respondent s reported that they had tightened credit 
standards on commercial real estate loans over the previous three months.  Demand for both C&I and commercial real estate loans at  domestic banks was reportedly weaker, on 
net, in the April survey.  By contrast, foreign institutions noted that the demand for both C&I and commercial real estate loans had changed little over the survey period.     With regard to loans to households, a re latively small net fraction of respondents 
reported having tightened lending standards on prime residential mortgages over the 
past three months, while considerable net fr actions of respondents indicated that they 
had tightened lending standards on nontraditi onal and subprime mortgage loans.  The 
banks reported that demand for subprime r esidential mortgages was little changed, on 
net, whereas significant net fractions of respondents reported that they had seen weaker demand for both prime and nontraditional residential mortgages over the past three months.  A significant net percentage of in stitutions also reported weaker demand for 
consumer loans over the same period.  
Business Lending  
In the April survey, domestic institutions reported that lending standards on C&I loans 
to large and middle-market firms were a bout unchanged, on net, over the past three 
months. The respondents noted, however, that they had further eased some terms on C&I loans to such firms over the same period.  About half of respondents—a slightly larger net fraction than in the January surv ey—indicated that they had trimmed spreads 
of loan rates over their cost of funds over the previous three months, and smaller net 
fractions reported that they had reduced  the costs of credit lines and eased loan 
covenants.

Credit standards on C&I loans to small fi rms were also reportedly unchanged, on 
balance, in the April survey.  Nonetheless,  about one-third of the domestic banks, on 
net, indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the past three months, and smaller net fracti ons reported that they had reduced the cost 
of credit lines and reduced premiums charged on riskier loans.   As they did in previous surveys, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that their standards on C&I loans were essen tially unchanged.  However, significant net 
fractions of these institutions indicated that  they had eased loan covenants, increased 
the maximum size of credit lines, and narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of 
funds.  In the April survey, nearly all domestic ba nks and all U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks that reported having eased thei r lending standards and terms pointed to 
more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most 
important reason for having done so.  Consid erable fractions of domestic and foreign 
institutions also cited increased liquidity in the secondary market for these loans as a 
reason for their move toward less-stringent business lending policies.  On net, about one-fifth of the domestic r espondents noted that they had experienced 
weaker demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms and from small firms. Among domestic respondents that saw weaker demand for such loans, about four-fifths attributed the softening in pa rt to borrowers’ decreased need to finance 
investment in plant or equipment, and about  two-thirds pointed to borrowers' increased 
use of internally generated funds.  The U. S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
reported that demand for C&I loans was about  unchanged, on net, over the past three 
months.  Regarding future business, 12 percent of domes tic respondents, on net, reported that the 
number of inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased over the previous three months, a somewhat larger net percen tage than in the January survey.  By 
contrast, foreign respondents indicated that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers was little changed in the April survey.  About one-third of domestic institutions—a la rger net fraction than in the previous 
survey—indicated that they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate 
loans over the past three months.  As in the January survey, about 40 percent of domestic respondents noted that they had e xperienced weaker demand for such loans 
over the same period.  By contrast, the vast majority of foreign respondents reported that lending standards on commercial real estate loans had remained basically 
 III-A-6   
 
 
unchanged in the April survey.  Demand for such loans at these institutions was also 
said to be about unchanged over the past three months.  
Household Lending 
In order to track developments regarding the major categories of residential real estate loans, the April survey asked banks to re port changes in standards on and demand for 
prime, nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgages.
1  A large majority of 
respondents indicated that standards on prime residential mortgages had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, with about 15 percent reporting 
somewhat tighter standards.  Of the fort y-two domestic institutions that originated 
nontraditional residential mortgages, about 45 percent noted a tightening of standards 
on such loans, whereas the rest reported that  their standards had remained basically 
unchanged.  Similarly, of the sixteen institutions that indicated they had originated subprime residential mortgages, about 45 pe rcent, on net, reported that they had 
tightened standards on such loans.
2  
 A tightening of standards for subprime a nd nontraditional mortgage loans did not 
appear to prompt a move toward more-stri ngent lending policies for prime mortgages.  
Indeed, of the nine institutions that re ported having tightened standards on subprime 
residential mortgages, only one indicated that it had also tightened standards on prime residential mortgages.  Five of the nine teen institutions that reported tightening 
standards on nontraditional mortgages also tightened standards on prime mortgages.  On net, about one-fifth of domestic institutions indicated that they had seen weaker demand for prime and nontraditional residential mortgages over the past three months, while the demand for subprime mortgages was reportedly little changed.  On balance, 10 percent of domestic respondents indicated that their willingness to make consumer installment loans had increased in  the April survey.  A small fraction of 
                                                 
1 Special questions in the July 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices addressed domestic banks’ holdings of subprime and nontraditional residential 
mortgages. The answers to these questions can be  used to calculate estimates of the average 
shares of subprime and nontraditional residential mo rtgages in total residential mortgages for the 
survey respondents as of June 30, 2006.  Thes e estimates suggest that subprime mortgages 
accounted for about 7 percent of all residentia l mortgages for the survey respondents, and 
nontraditional residential mortgages accounted for a bout 15 percent of all residential mortgages. 
In the third exhibit, these shares are used as we ights to construct the net percentage of domestic 
respondents reporting stronger demand (middle panel)  and tighter standards (lower panel) on all 
residential mortgage products taken together for 2007:Q2.   
2 These sixteen institutions accounted for 45 percent of residential mortgage loans on the books 
of all commercial banks as of December 31, 2006. 
 III-A-7   
 
 
institutions reported that they had eased lending standards on credit card loans; 
standards and terms on non-credit-card loan s were reportedly little changed over the 
past three months. About one-fourth of domes tic institutions indicated that they had 
experienced weaker demand for consumer lo ans, a somewhat smaller net percentage 
than in the January survey.

Trade in Goods and Services 
In February, the trade deficit narrowed to  $58.4 billion from $58.9 billion in January 
(revised).  The narrowing of the deficit refl ected a steep decline in imports, which more 
than offset a sizable decline in exports.  The value of exports of goods and services fell 
2.2 percent, following a 1.2 percen t increase in January.  The lion’s share of the February 
decline was in exports of cap ital goods.  Within capital goods, exports of aircraft, high-
tech goods, and other capital goods  all moved lower.  There were smaller declines in 
exports of industrial supplie s (particularly fuels), cons umer goods, and services.  
Automotive exports rose in Febr uary after falling in January.

The average value of exports in January and February increased 2.9 percent (a.r.) from 
the fourth quarter.  Strong exports of c onsumer goods pulled up the growth rate, while 
exports of services, industria l supplies, capital goods, and automotive products were all 
close to their fourth-quarter le vels.  In the advance NIPA rele ase for the first quarter, real 
exports of goods and services were reporte d to have fallen at an annual rate of

The value of imported goods and services fell 1.7 percent in February, after falling 
0.6 percent in January.  Oil imports plunged, reflecting declines in both prices and 
quantities.  Imports of industrial supplies,  capital goods, and automotive products also 
fell.  These declines were partially offset by a sizable increase in imports of consumer 
goods. 
 
The average value of imports in January and February was flat relative to the fourth 
quarter.  Imports of capital goods, services, and petroleum were all above their fourth-
quarter levels, but these increases were offs et by lower imports of industrial supplies and 
automotive products.  In the advance NIPA rele ase for the first quarter, real imports of 
goods and services were reported to have increased 2.3 percent at an annual rate. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In March, import prices for both  non-oil goods and core goods rose 
0.3 percent.  Prices for importe d material-intensive goods rose 0.7 percent, in large part 
reflecting higher prices for imported metals.  Prices for imported finished goods were up 
almost 0.2 percent in March.  Within fini shed goods, consumer goods experienced the 
largest price increase, rising 0.2 percent.  Outs ide of core imports, the price for imported 
natural gas rose 4.7 percent in March.  Pri ces for imported computers and semiconductors 
fell 0.8 and 0.1 percen t, respectively. 
 
In the first quarter, as reported in the a dvance NIPA release, im port prices increased 
1.3 percent at an annual rate , as lower prices for impor ted oil, computers, and 
semiconductors tempered higher prices for imported services, natural gas, and core 
goods.  Prices of imported core goods increa sed 2.8 percent, largely on account of higher 
prices for material-intensive goods.   
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 9 percent in March, following little change 
in February.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased to a 
similar extent over the two months, but the tim ing differed; spot WTI rose 9 percent in 
February and 2 percent in March.  In April, the spot price averaged  about $64 per barrel, 
up about $3.50 per barrel from the March aver age, and it closed at $64.41 per barrel on 
May 1.  The rise in oil prices since Febr uary reflects OPEC production restraint, 
production problems in Iraq and Nigeria, and increased concern about a possible 
disruption of exports from Iran.  Strong oil de mand in the United States, owing in part to 
below-normal temperatures in February and early March, has also supported oil prices.

Exports.   In March, export prices for core goods  rose 0.8 percent, the same rate of 
increase as in February.  Prices for exported nonagricultu ral industrial supplies rose 
1.9 percent, owing to higher pr ices for exported metals, chemicals, and fuels.  Prices for 
agricultural products also shot up in March, w ith higher prices for corn, vegetables, meat, 
and wheat all contributing to th e increase.  Prices for fini shed goods were little changed 
in March for the second consecutive m onth, after rising robustly in January. 
 
In the advance NIPA release for the first quart er, exports prices clim bed 3.6 percent at an 
annual rate, as higher prices for exports of core  goods and services more than offset steep 
declines in prices of exported computer s and semiconductors.  Core export prices 
increased 5.9 percent, boosted by a sharp incr ease in prices for exports of industrial 
supplies and agricultural goods.  
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table) m
oved up noticeably in the first three months of the year, continuing 
the upward trend that began in early 2005.  Mo st of these inflows came from countries 
other than the G10 and OPEC ( line 1c),  
 
.   
 
The chart on Foreign Official Financial Fl ows provides a broader perspective on these 
data.  The G
-10 countries have fluctuated be tween small inflows to and outflows from the 
United States in recent months , with the trend remaining a modest net outflow.  Although 
inflows attributed to OPEC countries have tapered off in recent months, the June 2006 
survey data on foreign holdings of U.S. securi ties indicate that inflows from OPEC have 
been stronger than recorded in these monthly data.  Securities acquired by OPEC through 
financial centers are assigned to those financial centers in the Treasury International Capital data, but often can be reclassified w ith aid of the survey data.  Inflows from 
countries other than the G-10 and OPEC have been growing over the past few years, with 
quite strong inflows in recent months.    Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities  (line 4 of the table and the top panels of 
the chart on Private Secu
rities Flows) in the fi rst quarter of this year are near the pace 
recorded in 2006.  Demand for Treasuries (lin e 4a) and equities (lin e 4d) strengthened 
from an already healthy level set in the fourth quarter, with  purchases of Treasuries in 
March exceeding all those re gistered in 2006.  However, purchases of corporate bonds 

IV-8 
(line 4c) moderated a tad and private foreigners  sold agencies (line 4b), on net.  Most 
transactions took place through the financia l centers of the United Kingdom and the 
Cayman Islands.     
 
U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5 of the table and the bottom panels of the 
chart on Private Securities Flows) remained str ong in the first quarter of this year.  Net 
acquisitions of bonds (line 5a) jumped up in March, pulling the quarter up in line with the 
pace recorded in 2006 and in line with new issuance by foreign firms.  Purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b), although slowing slightly from the strong pace set in the fourth quarter, remained elevated.   
 
Flows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) tend to be volatile.  They recorded net 
inflows for 2006 as a whole, and a modest out flow for the first quarter of this year.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
The trade-weighted index of the exchange va lue of the dollar against the major foreign 
currencies fell 2 percent over the intermeeting period, with the dollar depreciating against 
all currencies in the index except against th e yen.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar 
depreciated about 4 percent against the Cana dian dollar and 2 per cent against the euro 
and sterling, but it appreciated 2 percent agai nst the Japanese yen.  Much of the yen’s 
depreciation against th e dollar occurred in early April, reportedly on the re-establishment 
of yen-funded carry trades after the beginning of the new Japanese fiscal year.  The 
appreciation of the euro, the Canadian do llar, and sterling over the intermeeting period 
was in part due to economic data releases in  Europe and Canada that exceeded market 
expectations.  In particular, German empl oyment growth in February, French GDP 
growth for the fourth quarter of 2006, U.K. and Canadian consumer price inflation in 
February and March, and Canadian employment  growth in March were higher than had 
been expected.  Governor King was required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer because 12-month inflation rose to 3.1 percent in March, more than one 
percentage point higher than the Bank of Engl and’s target.  The letter  had to explain what 
the Bank of England would do to redress this situation. 
 
Over the intermeeting period, headline equity indexes rose 3 to 7 percent on net in the 
euro area, United Kingdom, Canada, and United States, but they were little changed in 
Japan.  Market participants attributed the in creases in Europe and North America to better 
than expected economic data and quarterly earnings reports. Japan’s lagging stock index 
performance was linked to indications that inflation and activity are not expected to 
accelerate. 
 
There were no monetary policy changes in major foreign in dustrial countries over the 
intermeeting period. Inflation compensati on, as implied by the difference between 
long-term nominal yields and yields on infl ation-indexed notes, were little changed. 
Option-implied volatilities on both the dollar-yen  and dollar-euro exchange rates declined 
over the intermeeting period.  The euro-dollar implied volatility remains at very low 
levels, and the dollar-yen implied volatili ty retraced previ ous upswings, possibly 
signaling an end to the late-February/early-March  “flight to quality” episode.  Realized 
volatility of stock market indexes and ten- year government bonds in Japan, Europe, and 
the United States was little changed over the intermeeting period. 
 
IV-13 
Towards the end of the intermeeting period, th e Turkish lira deprec iated 7 percent over 
two days and the Istanbul head line equity index declined 4 percent on growing tensions 
over the Islamist AK Party’s presidential candidate, Abdullah Gul.  On Saturday, 
April 28, the Turkish military released a stat em ent warning the AK Party government that 
it would protect the secular state; the s ecular opposition requeste d an annulment of 
Friday’s first-round parliamentary vot e, and approximately 700,000 civilians 
demonstrated against the ruling party on Sunday April 29.  On May 1, Turkey’s 
Constitutional Court issued a ruling in favor  of the opposition by stating that a quorum 
was not achieved in the first presidential vot e on Friday.  On May 2, the likelihood of an 
escalation of the political crisis decrease d further after Prime Minister Erdogan 
announced his intention to call early parl iamentary elections and to change the 
constitution so the president is  elected directly by  popular vote. Since May 1 the lira has 
appreciated about 1 percent, th e Istanbul headline index has increased almost 2 percent, 
and Turkey's EMBI+ spread narrowed 4 bps to 205 bps.  Other emerging market currencies, exchange indices and the EMBI+ spread were relatively stable over this 
episode, showing no signs of spillovers so far.  The dollar depreciated about 2 percent against the Brazilian re
 al, 1-1/3 percent against 
the Mexican peso, about 1 pe rcent against the Ko rean won and only 0.4 percent against 
the renminbi over the intermeeting period.  Th e overall EMBI+ spread declined 16 basis 
points, on balance.  The Mexican and Brazi lian EMBI+ spreads narrowed 18 and 33 basis 
points, respectively, while the Argentina EMBI + spread rose 55 basi s points on news that 
April’s inflation data will not  reflect the actual rise in consumer prices because of 
government alterations to the index. Latin Am erican and emerging Asia equity indexes 
rose 6 to 10 percent, and the Shanghai Com posite index soared 25 percent.  The outsized 
equity index gain in China coincided with th e report of higher than expected GDP growth 
data in 2007 Q1.  The People’s Bank of China raised the deposits to  required reserves 
ratio twice by 50 basis points over the interm eeting period to 11 percen t, and it raised the 
benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates by 27 basis points.   
  
.  The Desk did not intervene during 
the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
The advanced foreign economies appear to be growing at a steady rate.  Canadian growth 
seems to have rebounded from a disappoint ing fourth quarter.  Renewed household 
demand in Japan points toward further st rong growth in the first quarter, while 
investment demand seems to be underpinni ng growth in the United Kingdom.  Although 
euro-area exports have slowed from the rapid pace set in the fourth quarter and the hike 
in the German value added tax appears to have had a noticeable impact on purchases of consumer durables at the start of the year, overall economic conditions remain quite good. 
 
The inflation picture has been much more mixed by comparison.  Inflation in the euro 
area has remained steady at just below 2 percent since the end of last year, but inflation in 
the United Kingdom rose more than 1 percen tage point above the Bank of England’s 
target for the first time since that Bank was granted independence while in Canada 
twelve-month inflation jumped 90 basis points to over 2 per cent.  In stark contrast, 
consumer prices fell back into deflation in Ja pan, and there are indicatio ns that a return to 
positive rates of inflation may be several months off.  Central bank officials held their policy rates constant in the intervening period, although market s expect each of the four 
major foreign central banks to raise rates later this year. 
 
Japanese  consumer prices returned to deflation in February after ten months of positive 
twelve-month inflation rates.  As of Marc h, the headline CPI had declined 0.1 percent 
from a year ago and the core (which excludes fresh food only) CPI declined 0.3 percent.  Rising food and energy prices caused the Tokyo headline CPI to increase over the month 
of April, but consumer prices exclud ing fresh food and energy were unchanged, 
indicating that a return to positive nationwide inflation may not occur for several months.  
There appears to be little inflationary impulse  from wages despite a strong labor market; 
nominal wages fell 1.8 percent in February co mpared with a year earlier.  In more 
positive news, it was reported that average land prices rose last year for the first time since 1990.  Residential land prices rose 0.1 percent and commercial land prices rose 
2.3 percent. 
 
Measures of activity in th e first-quarter are encourag ing.  Real expenditures by 
households and retail sales both rose over the first quarter, indicating that some of the 
strength in household demand w itnessed in the fourth quarter has carried over into the

current year.  Household wealth rose a further 2.5 percent in  the fourth quarter of last 
year, and both high levels of wealth and the strong labor market seem to be driving the 
resurgence in private consumption.  The external  sector also appears poised to contribute 
further to growth; the trade surplus rose to  $23.7 billion in the first quarter, its highest 
level in two years, spurred by the weak value of the yen and rising exports to Europe. 
 
In contrast, core machinery orders fell in February, and shipments of investment goods 
and public works orders fell in both January and February, pointing to  a potential cooling 
of investment and government spending after surprisingly strong growth in the fourth 
quarter.  The Tankan diffusion index of business confidence remained steady in March, 
suggesting that the cooling of investment ma y only be temporary.  Although the diffusion 
index for large manufacturers declined fo r the first time in a year, those firms 
nevertheless reported plans to boost spending on plant and equipment in fiscal 2007 by 
2.9 percent, topping the amount reported a y ear ago for fiscal 2006, and they also 
indicated plans to furt her increase employment. 
 
Incoming data suggest that external demand in the euro area  has slowed after the 
surprising strength shown in the fourth quarter, when net exports accounted for most of GDP growth.  Merchandise exports rose  1.3 percent on average over January and 
February from the fourth-quarter level, s ubstantially less than the 4 percent quarterly 
growth rate registered in the three months to December.  Furthermore, merchandise 
imports accelerated in the firs t two months of the year.  In contrast, domestic economic 
conditions have improved in the intermee ting period.  According to the European 
Commission, industrial confiden ce rose to record levels, and consumer confidence, 
buoyed by improving labor market prospects, ro se to its highest level since mid-2001.  
The survey evidence has been confirmed by incoming production data for the first 
quarter.  Euro-area industrial production averaged over January and February was 0.7 percent higher than the fourth-quarter level. 
  
Germany’s IFO bounced back in March and April, suggesting that economic activity is recovering quickly after a star t-of-the-year moderation due to  January’s increase in the 
value-added tax.  The effect of the VAT hike was mostly limited to the timing of German 
purchases of consumer durables, automobile s in particular: car registrations soared 
14 percent in the fourth quarter and then pl unged 22 percent in the first three months of 
2007.  For the euro area as a whole, retail sales rebounded in February after dropping in 
January and stand just slightly below the fourth-quarter level.

The twelve-month rates of headline and co re (excluding energy and unprocessed food) 
consumer price inflation have converged in  recent months.  The twelve-month rate of 
headline consumer price inflation edged down to 1.8 percent in April from 1.9 percent in 
March.  While no details are available, the April slowdown is likely to be entirely 
attributable to base year e ffects.  Although the euro-area unemployment rate declined to 
7.2 percent in March, down more than a pe rcentage point since the beginning of 2006, 
there is thus far little eviden ce that the improved labor market is causing significant wage 
pressure.  Unit labor costs for the euro area fell over the second half of 2006, and ongoing 
negotiations in Germany suggest that wage gr owth will pick up only slightly from the 
modest pace registered over the past few years. 
  
Headline inflation in the United Kingdom  rose to 3.1 percent in March, its highest 
reading since inflation targeting was institut ed in 1997.  As mandated when inflation is 
more than a percentage point away from the offi cial target of 2 per cent, the Governor of 
the Bank of England wrote an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on April 16.  
In his letter, he indicated that  around half of the pick up in inflation over the past year can 
be accounted for by unexpected sharp increases in domestic energy prices and a rise in 
food prices related to weather conditions.  Although the Bank’s ce ntral projection has 
inflation falling a little below target by the end of 2007, the Governor noted that capacity pressures had increased, and that monthly inflation has recently been volatile. 
 
The preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter was 2.6 percent, quite close 
to the pace in the fourth quarter.  GDP co mponents for the first quarter are not yet 
available, but whereas consumption showed  signs of having softened, investment 
activities most likely continued at a brisk pace.  Retail sales grew 0.4 percent in the first 
quarter, well below their average of 1.3 pe rcent over the previous three quarters.  
However, the Bank of England’s survey of  U.K. private businesses suggests that 
investment intentions in the se rvice sector are at their highe st since the survey began in 
1997.  Moreover, investment intentions in the manufacturing sector we re at their highest 
since January 1998 despite the recen t appreciation of sterling. 
 
The labor market showed signs of softening as both employment and the participation rate fell slightly over the three months to February compared to a quarter earlier.  The 
claimant count and Labor Force Survey measures of the unemployment rate were both unchanged.  Average earnings rose 5.1 percent in the twelve months to February, their 
largest increase in two years.  However, growth in average earnings excluding bonuses

was more modest, at 3.6 percent, and unit la bor costs in the manufacturing sector fell 
over the same period, indicati ng that wage inflation has so far remained contained. 
 
In Canada , the level of real GDP by industry av eraged over January and February was 
2.9 percent (a.r.) higher than in the fourth  quarter.  Goods-produci ng industries outpaced 
services, with the utilities and oil and ga s extraction sectors leading the way.  The 
average level of construction activity was al so up compared to the fourth quarter.  
Services were held down by poor retail trade fi gures, consistent with a dip in real retail 
sales in both January and Fe bruary.  Overall business conditions remain strong.  The 
Purchasing Managers Index and the composite  index of leading indicators both rose 
sharply in the first quarter.  The nominal  merchandise trade balance averaged over 
January and February was up compared to the fourth quarter; in volume terms, average 
exports posted a healthy advance, while av erage imports declined about 1 percent. 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price in flation rose sharply, hitting 2.2 percent in 
March.  A surge in gasoline prices put upward pressure on consumer prices, as prices at 
the pump jumped nearly 13 percent between February and March and were up nearly 10 percent from a year earlier.  The twelve-m onth rate of core inflation, which excludes 
the eight most volatile components and the e ffects of indirect ta xes, ticked down to 
2.3 percent in March despite continued upward pressure from housing costs.  The twelve-month rate of new home price inflat ion remained elevated at 10 percent in 
February, down just slightly from previous months.  House prices increases over the past year have been driven largely by the west ern provinces, especially the oil-producing 
province of Alberta, where tw elve-month house price inflation is still 40 percent even 
after decelerating since the fall. 
 
Employment continued to expand rapidly, growing 1 percent in the first quarter, the largest quarterly gain in nearly five year s.  Full-time employment growth has been 
especially strong, indicating th at firms are confident that business conditions will remain 
buoyant for some time.  The strong market has attracted more job seekers (the labor force 
rose 0.9 percent in the first quarter) and reduced the unempl oyment rate to a generational 
low.  This may result in greater pressure  on wages.  Twelve-month wage growth of 
hourly manufacturing employees rose to 3 pe rcent in January, although the wage growth 
for salaried employees remained steady at 2.4 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Economic activity in the emerging markets appe ars to have remained robust in the first 
quarter.  In Asia, performance was supported by surging growth in China and continued 
strength, for the most part, elsewhere in the re gion.  In Latin America, indicators point to 
further lackluster growth in Mexico and so me weakening in Argentina, but in other 
countries, especially Brazil, conditions appear positive.  Inflation has picked up in some 
countries, notably China and India, but appe ars generally well contained for the emerging 
market economies as a whole. 
 
In China , activity accelerated significantly in the first quarter.  Real GDP increased at a 
blistering pace of more than 13½ percent (a.r .) according to staff estimates, primarily 
supported by soaring investment and exports.  Nominal growth of fixed asset investment 
picked up to 26 percent in the first quarter (four-quarter change) from just over 
20 percent in the previous two qua rters.  The pace of investment is now back to the very 
high rate seen in the first half of 2006.  A su rge in exports in the fi rst two months of the 
year led to a $50 billion increase (a.r.) in  the trade surplus in the first quarter, to 
$264 billion (a.r.).  The increas e in exports was fairly broad-based and reflected the 
continued strength of global demand for Chin ese goods, with some tentative indications 
that Europe and Latin America are accounti ng for a rising share of this demand.  The 
surge in exports in January and February was in part due to an acceleration of shipments in anticipation of a curtailm ent of export rebates on the VAT for many goods.  Indeed, 
export growth slumped in March when some of the export rebates were removed, narrowing the trade balance month-on-month. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation pi cked up a bit more in March, to about 
3¼ percent.  Much of the inflation stems fr om increases in food prices, which were up 
more than 7½ percent (twelve-month cha nge) in March.  Non-food price inflation 
remained in the neighborhood of 1 percent.   Foreign exchange reserves surged 
$140 billion in the first quarter to a level of more than $1.2 trillion.  At most, half of the 
surge can be accounted for by the change in the current account surplus and FDI inflows, suggesting that “hot money” inflows have picked up again.  The increase in foreign 
currency reserves was mostly sterilized, and au thorities raised benchmark interest rates in 
March by 27 basis points and continued to boos t the required reserve ratio (by a total of 
100 basis points in April).  However, money growth remained above 17 percent 
year-over-year, still higher than  desired by Chinese authorities.

In Hong Kong, recent indicators for the first quarter  suggest continued strength.  The 
nominal merchandise trade deficit narrowed sh arply.  The expiration of export rebates in 
China may have contributed to the increase in Hong Kong’s re-exports of Chinese goods 
this quarter.  Separate data on the quantity of exports for January and February suggest 
that net exports may make a positive contri bution to growth in the first quarter.  
Twelve-month inflation fell in February, reflecting a one-month holiday on public 
housing rent, but picked up again in March.

In Taiwan , indicators point to some moderation.  Industrial production fell again in the 
first quarter, with reductions in key sectors such as electronics and precision equipment.  
The merchandise trade surplus narrowed, and export orders for electronic products 
declined in the first quarter.  After turning negative at the e nd of last year, four-quarter 
consumer price inflation picked up to 1 percen t in the first quarter.  In late March, the 
Taiwanese central bank raised its discount rate 12.5 basis points.

In Korea , first-quarter GDP growth was 3.6 percent, just a touch below th at in the fourth 
quarter.  Domestic demand showed considerab le strength, with both private consumption 
and business investment rising sharply.  Export growth was also robust but was 
outweighed by outsized gains in non-oil im ports, especially capital goods.  Strong 
imports of services helped ge nerate a current account defici t in the first quarter.  The 
most recent production and spending indicators  suggest continued moderate gains in 
output.  The unemployment rate edged down to 3.2 percent in the first quarter; and 
twelve-month consumer price inflation ticked up  to 2.5 percent in April, but remains low 
relative to the Bank of Korea’s 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent target range.  In early April, 
Korean and U.S. negotiators concluded a bilate ral free trade agreement.  If ratified by the 
legislatures of both countries, market participants expect the agreement to help support 
Korean growth over the longer term.

Indian  economic indicators have remained r obust.  On average, industrial production 
was up nearly 2 percent in January and Februa ry from the previous quarter.  The trade 
deficit narrowed in the first quarter as expor ts increased slightly and imports fell.  
Inflation remains a concern, with the most recent twelve-month changes of the closely 
watched wholesale price index and the CPI near or above 6 percent.  At its April meeting, 
the Reserve Bank of India left interest rates unchanged, after tightening in earlier months, 
but announced its resolve to “c ondition policy and perceptions for inflation in the range 
of 4 to 4½ percent over the medium term” co mpared to its previous “comfort range” for 
wholesale price inflation of 5 to 5½ percen t.  The RBI also announced a series of 
measures to encourage capital outflows (e.g. raising the cap on overseas investment by 
IV-33 
Indian companies) and discourage capital inflows (e.g. reducing interest rates on non-
resident Indian deposit s at Indian banks.)

Economic indicators in the ASEAN  region, on balance, sugges t continued expansion in 
the first quarter.  In Singapor e, the advance unofficial estimat e (not shown) indicates that 
first-quarter real GDP rose 7 percent, despite weaker i ndustrial production,  as domestic 
demand, notably construction and services, supported activity.  Industrial production 
recovered in Thailand, but was generally down el sewhere in the region so far in the first 
quarter.  On the other hand, regional trade ba lances have remained strong in recent 
months. 
 
Outside of Indonesia and Singa pore, twelve-month consumer price inflation across the 
region continued to decline, owing to more  subdued energy price inflation, and in some 
countries, the unwinding of pr evious food prices increases  and appreciation of the 
exchange rate.  In the Philippines and Malays ia, in particular, inflation dipped as the 
effects of last year’s VAT increase in the Philippines and the reduc tion in domestic fuel 
subsidies in Malaysia fell out of the calcul ations.  Citing the moderation in inflation and 
the need to stimulate domestic demand, Bank of  Thailand cut interest  rates ½ percentage 
point in early April following two previous ¼ percentage point cuts in January and 
February.

Recent indicators for Mexico  point to further weakness in economic activity.  Both 
industrial production and the overa ll index of economic activity  fell in January, as soft 
performances in manufacturing, mining, and agriculture overwhelmed strength in the 
construction industry and the utili ties sectors.  In February, industrial production declined 
further as weakness continued in manufacturing, particularly automobiles, but also spread 
to construction, a previo us source of strength. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation was 4.2 pe rcent in March, the seventh consecutive 
month of inflation at or sli ghtly above the upper limit of th e central bank’s 2 to 4 percent 
inflation target range.  The Bank of Mexico  (BOM) tightened policy in its late-April 
meeting, with the overnight lending rate risi ng ¼ percentage point to 7.25 percent.  The 
Bank cited the need to prevent previous f ood price increases from spreading to other 
sectors.  Analysts had expected that th e BOM would leave mone tary policy unchanged, 
as incoming data from the first half of Apr il suggested inflation was beginning to recede.  
This was the first time the BOM had tightened policy since March 2005.

In Brazil , data released since the last Greenbook provided some signs that economic 
expansion in the first quart er continued.  Industrial pr oduction in February did not 
recover fully from its January decline, but capital goods imports  in March rose further.  
Retail sales in February were solid.  Twelve-month inflati on has been about 3 percent, 
IV-39 
well below the 4½ percent mid-point of the ta rget range for this year and next.  On 
April 18, the central bank reduced its policy rate, the Selic Rate, ¼ percentage point to 
12.5 percent, with three of the seven members having voted for a ½ percentage point 
decline. 
 
In late March, the government  released a benchmark revi sion of national income and 
product accounts.  Real GDP growth from  2000 to 2005 was revised up ¾ percentage 
point per year.  For 2006, the revision was 1 pe rcentage point, bringing real GDP growth 
last year to 4.7 percent (Q4/ Q4).  On the production side , the major revision was an 
increase to services output.  In terms of  demand components, private consumption was 
revised up, but fixed investment was lowered a result of less investment in structures.  
The upward revision to GDP also lowered the net debt-GDP ratio to 45 percent from 
50 percent previously.

Recent indicators for Argentina  suggest economic growth moderated in the first quarter.  
Industrial production grew just 0.3 percent in Q1, a sharp decel eration from the previous 
quarter's performance.  The index of econom ic activity, a monthly proxy of GDP, also 
indicates that output growth weakened thr ough February.  In addition, the merchandise 
trade surplus narrowed a bit in the first quarter.  Labor market conditions, at least for the 
fourth quarter, appear favorable, with the une mployment rate (n.s.a.) dipping into the 
single digits for the first time  since well before the crisis.  Twelve-month inflation edged 
IV-40 
down in March, reflecting more subdued increa ses in the prices for food, clothing, and 
education.

In Venezuela , the few available indicators for the fi rst quarter suggest continued growth 
and high inflation.  March auto sales were very strong and twelve-month CPI inflation 
was close to 20 percent in April.  The Chav ez government further increased its control 
over the oil sector in early May, when forei gn oil companies ceded operational control of 
heavy-oil projects, as previous ly agreed.  Companies must come to agreement with the 
government on the terms of the takeover by late June.   The government has stated that 
some companies might not be compensated and any compensation will be at most the 
book value of the projects and not in cash.  President Chavez  also announced this week 
that Venezuela will withdraw its me mbership in the IMF and World Bank. 
 
In April, the government petroleum comp any (PDVSA) issued $7.5 billion of dollar-
denominated bonds to local investors in exch ange for bolivares.  The sale was widely 
interpreted as an attempt to relieve some of the strong downward pressure on the bolivar.  
The bolivar has been pegged at about 2,150 pe r dollar since 2005 but, before the issue 
was announced, was trading in the parallel ma rket at about 4,000 per dollar.  The demand 
for bonds far exceeded the supply at the government’s price, leading some investors to 
resell their bonds on the parallel market for dollars at a profit.  (The parallel market 
exchange rate on May 1 stood at over 3,700 bolivares/dollar.)

In Turkey , economic activity continued to modera te, with GDP rising 5.2 percent over 
the four quarters of last year, sustained by strong domestic demand.  More recently, 
average industrial production in  January and February rose 0. 6 percent from the previous 
quarter.  Large trade and current account defici ts persisted in the fi rst quarter.  Despite 
real interest rates of over 10 percent, consumer price infla tion has risen recently, driven 
by double-digit increases in food and energy prices. 
 
Political tensions mounted between the Islamist  and the secular partie s at the start of the 
presidential election cycle.  In late April, Prime Minister Erdogan, of the Islamist AK 
party, unexpectedly declined the Presidenti al nomination and named Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul, subject to parliamentary approv al.  Gul failed to garner the necessary two-
thirds support, due to boycotts by the secula r opposition.  As a result, the Prime Minister 
has called for full parliamentary elections in late June.  Separately, the Turkish military 
issued a statement warning the government to continue the se cular tradition in 
governance.  The EU responded negatively to military involvement in Turkey’s domestic 
politics, but was supporti ve of early elections.

In South Africa , recent indicators point to conti nued growth.  Average manufacturing 
production in January and February was up 1.3 percent from the fourth quarter.  The 
current account deficit rose to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2006.  In the first quarter, however, 
the merchandise trade deficit contracted, as purchases of foreign cap ital goods cooled and 
exports increased across a ll categories.  Twelve-month consumer prices rose to 
5.5 percent in March, nearing the ceiling of the South African Reserve Banks’ 
IV-44 
3 to 6 percent target range.  A fuel price hike in March offset the effects of downward 
trending food prices.
