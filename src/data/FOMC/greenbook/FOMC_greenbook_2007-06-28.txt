Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The incoming data suggest that economic activity is expanding at a moderate rate.  In the 
labor market, payrolls continue to grow at a solid pace, and the unemployment rate 
remains relatively low.  Equipment spending, which had faltered around the turn of the 
year, picked up in March and April, and nonr esidential construction has stayed robust so 
far this quarter.  In addition, the drag fr om the inventory corre ction that held down 
activity late last year and early  this year appears to have about run its course in most 
industries.  Consumer outlays, which rose rapidly in the first quarter, have slowed 
recently, but income gains have remained solid.  In the housing sector, construction 
remains weak as builders respond to high i nventories of unsold new homes.  Top-line 
inflation has been boosted by rising energy pr ices in the past few months, but core 
inflation has been subdued of late.  
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand has been expanding at a m oderate pace recently.  Private payroll 
employment, after having increased at an average rate of about 165,000 per month during 
the second half of 2006, has decelerated to an  average increase of 108,000 jobs per month 
so far this year.  The recent job gains have been propelled by strong hiring in the service 
sector, while employment in goods-producing in dustries has continue d to decline.  In 
May, the rise in payroll employment, combin ed with a slightly longer workweek, boosted 
aggregate hours of private production or nons upervisory workers to a level 0.7 percent 
(not at an annual rate) above the first-quarter average.  
 In the household survey, the unemployment ra te held steady at 4.5 percent in May and 
has been largely unchanged for eight months .  The number of job losers unemployed less 
than five weeks as a percentage of empl oyment—a proxy for the layoff rate—also has 
moved little, on net, so far this year; in May, the three-month moving average was about 
equal to the level in the fourth quarter of last year.  However, the number of unemployed 
job losers has edged up since the fourth quarter , an indication, perhaps, that transitions 
out of unemployment have slowed.  Meanwh ile, the labor force participation rate 
remained at 66.0 percent in May after havi ng fallen 0.2 percentage point in April. 
 Other indicators of labor demand have been  mixed.  The four-week moving average of 
initial claims for unemployment insurance stood at 311,000 in the week ending June 9, a 
level consistent with solid employment ga ins.  As noted above, the current pace of 
layoffs, as measured by the CPS, appears to ha ve held about steady so far this year.  In 
addition, hiring plans, as measured by Manpower and the National Federation of 
Independent Business (NFIB), remain elevated.  In contrast, job openi ngs and hires, as

reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in its JOLTS survey, have moderated a bit so 
far in 2007.  And layoff announcements, which are measured by Challenger, Gray, and 
Christmas, and capture future downsizing plans  during the next six to twelve months, 
have increased lately.  Measures of labor market tightness suggest th at little has change d in the balance of 
supply and demand since the middle of last ye ar.  The percentage of firms reporting to 
the NFIB that they had a hard-to-fill position was about unchanged in May and on par 
with the average level in 2006.  In ad dition, according to the Conference Board, 
households’ assessments of job availability ha ve continued to be relatively positive.   
 The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 1.4 percent in the first quart er after increasing at a rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2006.  Over the four quarters endi ng in the first quarter of 2007, productivity 
growth averaged only 1.1 percen t, 0.9 percentage point less th an the pace recorded during 
the preceding four quarters.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) has incr eased only modestly so far in  the second quarter after 
having been little changed, on balance, in the first quarter, when some manufacturers 
were restraining production to deal with a bui ldup of inventories.  More recently, output 
has been partly held back by softness in the high-tech sector.  Howe ver, forward-looking 
indicators—such as new orders and busine ss surveys—point to some improvement in 
overall production in coming months.  In a ddition, the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory

system and industry anecdotes suggest that i nventories should not be an impediment to 
future production gains in most industries.1   
 Manufacturing production edged up 0.1 percent in May after having risen 0.2 percent in 
April.  The factory operating rate in May, at 79.9 percent,  was only slightly above its 
1972–2006 average of 79.8 percent a nd 0.4 percentage point belo w its year-earlier level.
2 
The production of motor vehicles and parts de creased 0.5 percent in May after a gain of 
1.4 percent in April.  Light motor vehicle a ssemblies in the second qua rter are on track to 
increase 700,000 units, to an annual rate of 10.9 million units, after sinking to a fourteen-
year low of 10.2 million units in the first quarter .  Days’ supply of light vehicles in May 
remained at automakers’ desired levels, and schedules for the third quarter call for light 
vehicle production to rise further to 11.3 million units.   Meanwhile, production of 
medium and heavy trucks has continued to m ove lower, on balance, in response to the 
falloff in demand after the Environmental Prot ection Agency’s new regulations that went 
into effect earlier this year.  The output of high-tech industries rose at a relatively sluggish p ace of about ½ percent 
per month, on average, in April and May, a nd near-term indicators— such as those in 
surveys of business plans for future spe nding on high-tech equipment—point toward 
continued softness for a while.  In April a nd May, computer production posted relatively 
moderate gains after a jump in the first qua rter when manufacturers rolled out machines 
capable of handling the new Microsoft Vist a operating system.  In line with this 
deceleration in production, Gartner expects unit shipments of personal computers to only 
edge up this quarter after having increased shar ply in the first quarter ; unit shipments of 
servers are also projected to rise at a mo re modest pace.  Communications equipment 
production has also softened of late after a st rong showing in the first quarter.  The output 
of semiconductors has risen only tepidly in th e past few months, and likely reflects softer 
demand from downstream industries—like co mputers and communications equipment—
as well as the attempt by manufacturers to pare elevated stocks of chips. 
                                                
 
1 Semiconductor inventories are a possible exception. The Semiconductor Industry Association’s data 
on semiconductor shipments in April indicated that average selling prices continued to fall more rapidly 
than normal, particularly for memory chips. The trend may indicate that excess inventories of chips 
remained more of a problem at the start of the second quarter than earlier news had suggested. 
2 The IP release for May included upd ated estimates of industrial capac ity for 2007.  The estimated rate 
of increase in manufacturing capacity from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2007 is 2.1 percent, a downward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the initial estimate published in 
mid-February.  The lower estimate primarily reflects a weaker outlook for capital spending by 
manufacturers, as suggested by the recent reading on the diffusion index of manufacturers’ capital spending 
plans reported in the Institute for Supply Management’s Semiannual Economic Forecast.

Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products, output increased 0.2 
percent per month, on balance, in April a nd May.  The production of durable consumer 
goods rose in both months after having declined in the fourth and firs t quarters, while the 
output of nondurable consumer goods continued to be little changed.  The output of 
business equipment continued to be boosted by solid gains in the production of civilian 
aircraft, while other categories have con tinued to move lower on balance.  The 
production of construction supplies increased  in May but remained about 2½ percent 
below its year-earlier level.  Days’ suppl y of construction supplies appears to have 
reversed the run-up that occurred in the s econd half of 2006, an indi cation that inventory 
overhangs of these products are unlikely to furt her restrain output in the next few months.  
The production of industrial materials such as  steel, plastic products, and nonmetallic 
mineral products also firmed in recent months  after having been held down since late last 
year by weak downstream demand and excessive stocks.  
 Near-term indicators of producti on have generally strengthened  and are consistent with 
moderate production gains in the next few months.  The new orders diffusion index 
published by the Institute for Supply Manage ment (ISM) increased further in May, and 
the various regional surveys also moved highe r on balance.  The June reading of the 
Empire State Manufacturing Survey moved up for a third consecutive month and remained at a level associated with conti nued production gains.  In June, available 
weekly data show gains in industrial produc tion for light motor vehicles, appliances, 
steel, and gasoline.    
Light Motor Vehicles  
In April and May, total sales of light vehicl es averaged an annual rate of 16.1 million 
units, compared with a rate of 16.5 million un its in the first quarter.  Lower sales at 
Chrysler and Ford caused the Big Three’s domes tic market share to slip in May to 51.6 
percent, about 2 percentage points below its  average level in 2006.

Consumer demand for light vehicles has held up despite relatively pessimistic views of

manufacturers’ price incentives.  Consumer s are apparently responding to higher fuel 
prices, however, as the mix of  sales in May involved unchara cteristically large shifts, 
both away from light trucks toward autos a nd, within autos, toward more fuel-efficient 
vehicles.4  As a result, the averag e fuel economy of new vehicles sold shot up for the 
month.    
Consumer Spending  
Real consumer spending appears on track to  post a modest gain in the second quarter 
after much larger increa ses late last year and early this  year.  The deceleration primarily 
reflects sluggish outlays for goods in recent months.  Expenditures on services have fluctuated considerably so fa r this year, as unusual weathe r patterns have led to wide 
swings in spending on energy services. But cu tting through the fluctuations, spending on 
services has been increasing at a solid clip.
5 
 After sizable gains around the turn of the year, real spen ding on goods other than motor 
vehicles has been nearly flat since the n.  Although nominal expe nditures at the retail 
control group of stores posted a strong adva nce in May, after factoring in our projection 
for consumer prices, we estimate that real PC E control rose only 0.2 percent last month.  
The May reading was held down by an estimated decline of 2 percent in  real purchases of 
gasoline, perhaps a response to the run-up in  pump prices over the past few months.  
Indicators of near-term spending—such as weekly chain store sales and consumer 
sentiment—point to only m odest increases in spendi ng on goods other than motor 
vehicles this month and next.   Consumer spending continues to be supporte d by the current and past performance of 
most fundamentals.  Regarding the latest num bers, the wealth-income ratio ticked down 
in the first quarter, as the stock market rose  only a little and house prices remained soft, 
but much of the lost ground has probably been  recovered as a result of the increase, on 
balance, in stock prices this quarter.  For income, real dis posable personal income (DPI) 
expanded at a moderate pace, on average, in th e first four months of this year, although  
                                                
 
4 An additional factor temporarily damping recent lig ht truck sales may be th e impending introduction 
of Chrysler’s new line of minivans (classified as light trucks).  Although sales of light trucks declined for 
every major manufacturer in May, roughly half of  the overall decrease occu rred at Chrysler.   
5 Note, however, that many categorie s of services are based on judgmen tal trends because of a lack of 
hard data in the initial estimates.

income growth in May likely was eroded by the sharp increase in consumer prices.6  
Moreover, data from unemployment insuran ce tax records indicate that nominal wages 
and salaries were stronger in the fourth quarter than previously estimated.  However, the 
rise in short-term interest rates since mid-2004 may have be en a restraining influence on 
consumer behavior.  
Housing   
Residential construction activity continues to decline as builders attempt to work off an 
elevated inventory of unsold new homes.  On balance, recent readings for sales of both 
new and existing homes have been lower than the relatively steady pace of sales posted in the second half of 2006.  Some, though not all, of  this further weakening is likely related 
to the tightening of lending standards for nonpr ime borrowers that began in February.  
Single-family housing starts decreased 3 per cent in May to an annual rate of 1.17 million 
units.  Adjusted permit issuance in this sector also slipped a bit furthe r.  Starts generally 
have been running above adjusted permits sin ce early last year.  The gap between these 
two series is typically closed by movements in  starts toward permits, a sign that starts 
may fall further in the near term.  After an upswing in February, sales of ex isting single-family homes dropped back in 
March and declined modestly in April. Sales of new homes in this sector, which plummeted early this year, jumped in Apr il.  Smoothing through the monthly volatility, 
the average pace of existing home sales in March and April was 4 percent below the 
average in the second half of 2006, and the corresponding contraction in new home sales 
was 8 percent.  For the most part, indicators of housing demand point to some further near-term 
softening.  The index of pending home sales fell 3 percent in April, a sign that sales of 
existing homes likely will move down in the coming months.  Mortgage rates have also moved up noticeably since the end of April.   Nonetheless, the index of mortgage 
purchase applications has risen 4 percent since the end of April, somewhat offsetting the 
weak tone of the other indicators.  The inventory of new homes for sale remains at  historically high levels.  Relative to the 
three-month average pace of sales, the months’ supply in April was more than 60 percent  
                                                
 
6 Real DPI declined in April after a robust gain in  the first quarter.  The readings for January through 
March were boosted by the BEA’s treatment of unusually large bonus payments and stock option exercises 
in the first quarter.

.  
High inventories and low sales in April sugg est that homebuilders may have to reduce 
construction even further to work off their excess inventories of unsold new homes.    
 
House-price appreciation con tinues to slow.  The purchase-only price index for existing 
homes calculated by the Office of Federal H ousing Enterprise Oversight was 3 percent 
higher in the first quarter than its year-earli er value, a significant deceleration compared 
with the 10 percent a ppreciation in the previous fou r-quarter period.  Meanwhile, the 
average price of existing homes sold—which does not adjust for changes in the quality of homes—was flat in April.  Prices of ne w homes have also de celerated, although to a 
lesser extent than existing home prices.  However, these figures may understate the actual deceleration in the cost to purchasers of new homes because homebuilders reportedly have stepped up their use of non-price m easures—such as granting more-favorable 
mortgage terms, paying closing costs, and including optional upgrades at no cost—to bolster sales and unl oad inventory.   
 
Equipment and Software 
The level of real spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to be about 
unchanged in the current quarter.  Although spending for heavy trucks continues to 
decline, outlays for E&S other than transporta tion look healthier this quarter than in the 
previous few quarters, as shipments moved up markedly in April and May.  Moreover, 
orders for nondefense capital goods (excluding transportation) have improved recently, as 
have the ISM’s monthly indexes of business conditions and several regional indexes.  That said, the fundamental determinants of  business spending remain mixed.  Business 
output has been expanding more slowly since early last year.  In  addition, although the 
cost of capital continued to decline through the first quarter, the downtrend has likely 
been curtailed to some extent by the backup in corporate bond rates in recent weeks.  
However, firms retain ample cash in reserv e to finance investment, and the latest 
semiannual survey of manufacturers’ capit al spending plans conducted by the ISM 
indicates that firms plan to increase their nominal expenditures at a solid pace in 2007.  
 
Expenditure increases in the high-tech sector supported th e rise in overall E&S spending 
in the first quarter, but recent data point towa rd a smaller increase in tech spending in the 
second quarter.  The growth in high-tech sp ending in the first quarter was possibly

boosted by the introduction of Microsoft’s Vi sta operating system.  Real computer 
spending in the NIPAs rose at an annual rate of nearly 50 percent la st quarter, and the 
latest Quarterly Services Survey suggests th at software spending increased at a solid pace 
in the early part of the year.  More recentl y, however, high-tech spending appears to have 
decelerated.  The industrial production inde x for computers, which is one of the 
indicators used by the BEA to estimate spendi ng in this category, increased less rapidly 
in April and May than in previous months, a nd the Census Bureau reported that nominal 
shipments of computers and peripheral e quipment declined in April for a second 
consecutive month.  Some surveys tracki ng business spending plans for high-tech 
equipment, such as those c onducted recently by the NABE and by CIO magazine, also 
point to a moderation.  Similarly, the guida nce offered by telecommunications service 
providers for their capital expenditures in 2007 is consistent with a modest increase for 
the year as a whole.  Business outlays on transportation equipment app ear set for another decline this quarter.  
Sales of medium and heavy trucks tumbled again in May from already low levels in 
April.  The recent drop in truck demand primarily reflects the payback from sales that were pulled forward into 2005 and 2006 in anti cipation of the tightening of emissions 
standards that took effect in January 2007.  Looking ahead, new orders for medium and 
heavy trucks increased in May but remained at  very low levels, suggesting that sales will 
remain depressed in coming months.  Meanwhil e, aircraft spending surged in the first 
quarter after three consecutive quarters of declines, but data on April shipments and on 
deliveries from Boeing in May suggest that  spending may be dropping back to more-
normal levels this quarter.  Real spending in the category of equipment other than high-tech and transportation is 
apparently on the mend after sizable declin es over the previous two quarters.  In 
particular, shipments of indus trial machinery have surged since their recent low in 
January.  Moreover, shipments of mining, oil field, and gas field equipment as well as 
shipments of ventilation, heating, air conditioni ng, and refrigeration equipment have also 
improved.   
Nonresidential Construction  
Construction activity in the nonresidential sector has resume d expanding at a brisk rate 
this year after a brief lull in the fourth quarter of 2006.  In addition, the fundamentals in 
this sector generally point to  further gains in the near term.  Vacancy rates in the 
industrial and office sectors have moved down over the past few years, and the vacancy 
rate in the retail sector, alt hough up a bit over the past year, is  still below the average for

the series (1992 to date).  Moreover, recent readings on architectural billings point to 
additional construction increas es going forward, albeit at a pace well below that seen 
since this sector began to rebound in late 2005.7 
 
Real investment in drilling and mining stru ctures, which expanded rapidly during much 
of 2005 and 2006, dropped at an annual rate of 13 percent in the firs t quarter.  Moreover, 
the total number of drilling ri gs in operation was little chan ged during the second quarter, 
suggesting that activity in this sector re mained subdued.  Rising materials costs and 
shortages of skilled labor may be contributing to the recent decline in investment activity. 
 
Business Inventories  
In the past few months, firms in most indus tries appear to have made considerable 
progress in addressing the inventory overha ngs that developed last year.  After 
subtracting nearly 1 percentage  point from the annualized grow th rate of real GDP in the 
first quarter, investment in real nonfarm i nventories excluding motor vehicles seems 
likely to impose little, if any, additional dr ag in the second quarter.  The book value of 
manufacturing and trade invent ories excluding motor vehicles increased at an annual rate 
of $74 billion in April; however, rising energy prices likely accounted for a sizable part 
of this increase.  The ratio of manufactu ring and trade book-value inventories (excluding 
motor vehicles) to sales ticked down again in April after a decline in March.  Meanwhile, 
the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system s uggests that in May, the months’ supply of 
inventories excluding motor vehicles reversed its April uptick and remained at the lower 
level that has prevailed since February.  In addition, the underlying industry detail 
indicates that most inventory ra tios are not particularly elevat ed by historical standards.  
Finally, the number of purchasing managers wh o viewed their customers’ inventories as 
“too low” exceeded the number who saw them as “too high” for the third month in a row 
in May.  
Federal Government Sector  
The federal budget deficit continued to narro w in April and May.  More generally, the 
deficit (adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions) for the twelve months ending in May 2007 was $184 billion, le ss than 1½ percent of nominal GDP and 
$90 billion lower than the deficit for the twelve months ending in May 2006.

7 About 88 percent of the construction projects co vered by the architectural billings index are 
nonresidential.  
8 For the twelve months ending in May, the primary budget balance—which is equal to receipts minus 
non-interest outlays—showed a surplus of about $50 b illion.  A primary budget surplus typically implies a 
decrease in the ratio of federal debt to nominal GDP.

smaller deficit reflects a combination of still ra pid increases in receipts as well as some 
deceleration in the growth of outlays.    Although receipts have continued to  rise briskly, their rate of increase has slowed from 
the exceptionally strong pace in the past couple of years.  In particular, total corporate 
revenues for April and May rose only 6 percen t relative to their level in the comparable 
period of 2006.  Moreover, corporate tax paym ents from the daily Treasury statements 
for June were running just 4 percent above th eir year-ago level.  Individual income and 
payroll tax payments in April and May—which included most of the final payments on individual tax liabilities fo r 2006—were about 10 percent abov e their year-earlier level, a 
somewhat lower rate of increase than in  the previous couple of years.     
 Federal outlays during the twelve months endi ng this May were up 4½ percent, compared 
with those in the twelve months ending in May 2006.  Mostly because of higher interest 
rates, net interest payments posted another brisk increase relative to their year-earlier 
level; nevertheless, the rise was smaller than  a year ago.  Growth in non-interest outlays 
has slowed since last year, primarily because of diminished spending for “other” outlays—in particular, federal spending for disa ster relief and flood insurance, outlays for 
the implicit subsidy costs of student loan s, and spending for agricultural commodity 
programs.  The most recent figures from mont hly Treasury statements suggest that real 
defense purchases as measured in the NIPAs will bounce back in the second quarter after having fallen in the first quarter.  Fi nally, the Congress enacted a $120 billion 
supplemental appropriations bill on May 25; this bill included about $100 billion in 
budget authority for defense spending, most of which is expected to be spent over the 
next two years.

in the NIPAs are rising briskly in the second quarter.  The sector  averaged about 21,000 
net new hires per month in April and May, si milar to the moderately strong pace of 
employment gains in 2006.  Real construction expenditures appear to  have posted another 
sizable increase in April, continuing the ramp ing up in investment spending that began at 
the start of 2006.  
                                                
 
9 The supplemental appropriations bill also included legislation to increase the federal minimum wage 
over the next two years.  The current federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is scheduled to increase to 
$5.85 on July 24, 2007, and then rise to $6.55 on July 24, 2008, and to $7.25 on July 24, 2009.

State government finances have been strong a nd stable in the current  fiscal year, which 
ends on June 30 for most states, accord ing to a recent report from the National 
Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO).  Although th e average year-end balance 
across states is expected to be less than the hi storic high of last fisc al year, most states 
continue to hold ample reserves.  States anticip ate that they will end the fiscal year with 
balances, on average, equal to  8 percent of expenditures, we ll above the 5 percent level 
generally considered to constitute adequate fiscal reserves.10  Reflecting the fiscal health 
of the sector, NASBO also reports that many states are looking to increase their spending 
next year.  For example, governors in thir ty-four states have made proposals for the 
upcoming fiscal year aimed at reducing th e number of individuals without health 
insurance.  Proposed costs fo r these programs are significa nt—in total equal to around 
$18 billion annually.  
Prices  
Headline consumer price inflation has picked up in recent months, boosted by substantial 
increases in energy prices.  The overall CPI rose 0.7 percent in Ma y after a 0.4 percent 
increase in April.  These readings boosted the annual rate of incr ease in headline CPI 
inflation to 7.0 percent over the past thr ee months—well above the 4 percent of the 
previous three months and the 2½ percent incr ease in 2006.  However, core inflation has 
slowed; in May the CPI excluding food and en ergy rose 0.1 percent, and the increase 
over the most recent twelve months, at 2.2 percent, is a little lower than over the 
preceding twelve months.  Resource utiliz ation remains relativel y tight, but long-run 
inflation expectations continue to stay within  the range they have occupied for much of 
the past few years.  On the basis of the CPI data, we estimate th at core PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in May 
after an increase of 0.1 percent in April and no change in March.  Ov er these past three 
months, we estimate that these prices rose at an annual rate of 1.0 percent; they were held 
down, in part, by declines in volatile categorie s such as apparel and tobacco products that 
are likely transitory and that followed apprec iable price increases in the preceding three 
months.  The rent components have also dece lerated recently.  Owners’ equivalent rent 
increased just 0.1 percent in May and at a 2.1 percent annual rate over the past three 
months, down from a 3.2 percen t annual rate of increase over the preceding three months. 
A portion of the slowdown reflect s technical adjustments to stri p out the cost of utilities  
                                                
 
10 Despite the current healthy fiscal position of the sector, many states are expressing concern about 
potential structural deficits over the longer term.  These concerns are driven by the expectation of continued 
strong demand for state spending—particularly for benefits for retiring state employees and for health-
related programs—along with an anticipated slowing of revenue gains in future fiscal years.

when translating tenants’ rents to owners’ equi valent rents and is lik ely to be transitory.11 
That said, tenants’ rents have also decelerated over the past few months. 
 Over the twelve months ending in May, we  estimate that core PCE prices rose 
1.9 percent, a smaller increase than over th e preceding twelve-month period.  However, 
the step-down in the twelve-month change wa s due almost entirely to a slowing in the 
nonmarket component.  Market-based core PCE prices likely rose  1.7 percent over the 
twelve months ending in May, about the same  as over the previous twelve months.   
Consumer food prices have decelerated in the past few months after sizable increases in 
January and February.  However, even the recent increases were noticeably above the 
rate of core price inflation.  Although the brisk pace of food pric e increases has been 
widespread, price increases for meats have been particularly large because of strong 
demand and higher costs for feed, most notably  corn; corn prices have increased more 
than 80 percent over the past year, driven by ri sing demand for ethanol.  Over the twelve 
months ending in May, the CPI for food and be verages rose 3.9 percent, compared with a 
1.9 percent increase in the pr evious twelve months.  
 The CPI for energy jumped 5.4 percent in May, extending the pattern of exceptionally 
steep increases seen in the preceding couple of months.  Almost all of the recent increase 
in energy prices reflects higher prices of  refined petroleum products, as widespread 
refinery glitches have held domestic pr oduction below typical seasonal levels.  In 
addition, although gasoline inventories have ri sen considerably in recent weeks, they 
remain at the low end of their historical ra nge for this point in the year.  With supply 
quite tight, gasoline margins are quite high by historical standards,  though they have 
fallen somewhat in the past couple of weeks.   The substantial jump in consumer energy 
prices over the March-to-May period ha s roughly reversed the price declines in 
September and October of last year, leaving the most recent twelve-month change in the 
CPI for energy at 4.7 percent.  Broader measures of inflation, which are ava ilable only through the fi rst quarter of this 
year, have slowed relative to th e pace of the past couple of ye ars.  The latest four-quarter 
rise in the price index for GDP less food a nd energy was 2.6 percent, down ¼ percentage  
                                                
 
11 Some residential rent contracts include utilities, bu t owners’ equivalent rent (OER) is intended to be 
measured on a “pure rent” basis (with homeowner utilities already covered in the energy portion of 
consumer prices).  Thus, when translating the rent  data into OER, the BLS makes an adjustment for 
changes in utilities prices for the affected rental units , assuming that, in the current situation, higher utilities 
costs imply lower pure rent for any given contract rent.

point from the preceding four-quarter peri od.  Although core PCE inflation picked up 
slightly through the fi rst quarter, price increases for other components of final demand, 
especially construction, decelerated.    As measured by the Reuters/Michigan surve y, the median expectation for year-ahead 
inflation increased further, to 3.5 percent in early June after having risen to 3.3 percent in 
April and May.  These increases are consiste nt with the energy-d riven acceleration in 
overall consumer prices in recent months.  Me dian five- to ten-year  expectations ticked 
up to 3.1 percent in April and May but fell back in early June to 3.0 percent.  This figure 
is within the narrow range that has prevai led over the past two years, although it is 
slightly above the range typical in 2003 and 2004.  Inflation compensation from TIPS 
five to ten years ahead have changed little  over the intermeeting period and remains 
within the range seen in recent years.   
 At earlier stages of processi ng, the producer price index (PPI) for core intermediate goods 
increased 0.4 percent in May af ter a jump of 0.8 percent in Ap ril.  Despite an acceleration 
in intermediate prices in the past six m onths, the most recent twelve-month change, at 
about 3 percent, is well below the 6¾ percen t increase in the previ ous 12-month period.  
This pattern partially reflects price move ments in energy-intensive goods, such as 
industrial chemicals.  Commodity prices continue to move up.  The Journal of Commerce index of industrial 
materials has risen 1¾ percent since the ti me of the May Greenbook, and the Commodity 
Research Bureau’s index of spot industrials is up 4¼ per cent.  Although metals prices, 
which have been pushing up commodity prices over the past couple of years, have in 
many cases turned down in recent weeks, this  small dip has been more than offset by 
increases in a variety of ot her commodities, such as cotton, lumber, and foodstuffs.  
 
Labor Costs 
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business s ector is now reported to have increased 
at an annual rate of 11.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared w ith the 8.5 percent 
estimate reported in the previous BLS release.
12  The staff estimates that the increase in 
nonfarm business compensation per hour slowed to an annual rate of  2.7 percent in the 
first quarter.  The outsized increase in comp ensation per hour in the fourth quarter of 
2006, as well as the deceleration between the f ourth quarter and the first quarter of 2007,  
                                                 
12 As noted earlier, this upward revision reflected the incorporation of new information on wages and 
salaries from unemployment insurance records.

reflected $50 billion in one-time bonus pa yments and stock options, which the BEA 
assumed accrued in the fourth quarter, and th e subsequent unwinding of these payments 
in the first quarter.13  The sizable run-up in the leve l of compensation per hour over the 
past couple of quarters has caused the markup of prices ov er unit labor costs to turn 
down, although it remains above its long-term average.    More-timely data point to some leveling off of compensation infla tion recently.  After 
accelerating from early 2004 to late 2006, th e twelve-month change in average hourly 
earnings of production or nonsupe rvisory workers has decelerated in recent months.  
Over the first five months of this year, av erage hourly earnings have increased at an 
annual rate of 3.3 percent rate, a bit below last year’s pace.

13 As noted in the Consumer Spending section, the bonuses were paid—and showed up as wage and 
salary disbursements—in the first quarter of 2007.  However, the BEA assumed that the bonuses represented remuneration for productive activity in the four th quarter of 2006 and thus imputed them to that 
period’s compensation bill.  The BEA will not have actual source data for wage and salary disbursements 
in the first quarter until August.

III-1 Overview  
Market expectations for the path of moneta ry policy beyond the very near term shifted 
sharply upward over the intermeeting period, as investors eliminated most of the policy 
easing that had been anticipated over the ne xt two years.  Trea sury yields moved up 
across the term structure, reflecting the highe r expected path for policy and an apparent 
rise in term premiums.  Stoc k prices were up slightly, on balance, as gains spurred by 
favorable economic news and merger a nd acquisition announcements outweighed the 
effects of higher interest rates.  Strong profits continued to su pport corporate credit 
quality, and corporate bond spreads rema ined low.  Delinquency rates and new 
foreclosures on subprime variab le-rate mortgages have continued to rise, but broader 
measures of household credit qual ity show few signs of stress.  
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Market participants largely anticipated th e FOMC’s policy decision at the May meeting 
to keep the target federal funds rate uncha nged.  Nevertheless, the Committee’s retention 
of the language that “core inflation remains somewhat elevated” reportedly led investors 
to mark up a bit their expect ed policy path beyond the Augus t meeting.  The release of 
the minutes from the May meeting and othe r FOMC communications elicited little 
response in financial markets.  However, economic data releases generally came in on the strong side of investors’ e xpectations, and several primary dealers abandoned forecasts 
for cuts in the federal funds rate this year.  In accordance with that  reassessment of the 
outlook, Eurodollar futures rates now imply an expected federal funds rate of 5 percent 
by the end of 2008, up a little more than 50 basi s points since the May FOMC meeting.   
 The implied distributions of the federal funds  rate six months and twelve months ahead 
became considerably less skewed toward policy easing over the intermeeting period, and 
near-term uncertainty about the future path of policy, derived from options on Eurodollar 
futures contracts, declined notably  over the interm eeting period.   
 
Broadly in line with the revision in policy expectations, the two- year nominal Treasury 
yield rose roughly 30 basis poi nts over the intermee ting period.  The ten-year nominal 
Treasury yield moved up close to 50 basis points, as one-y ear forward rates increased 
across the term structure, particularly at interm ediate maturities.  Real yields rose in line 
with nominal yields at the fi ve-year maturity and rose sl ightly less at the ten-year 
maturity.  Consequently, inflation compensati on over the next five years changed little, 
but inflation compensation five to ten years ahead increased nearly 20 basis points.  The 
staff’s term structure models attribute most of  the substantial increa se in longer-maturity

compensation to higher expected inflation.  Anecdotal reports poi nted to mortgage 
hedging activity as possibly contribu ting to the volatility in yields  at longer maturities.     
   
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes were  up 2 percent to 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, as the boost from largely favorable m acroeconomic news and the steady stream of 
merger and acquisition announcements more than  offset the effects of higher interest 
rates.  As evidence of the damp ing effect of interest rates, shares of REITs and utilities, 
which are quite sensitive to bond yields, fell about 4 percent over th e intermeeting period.  
The spread between the twelve-month forw ard trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 
firms and a real long-run Tr easury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—
narrowed a fair bit but remained near its average over the past two decades.  Implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index spiked on a fe w days, when rising interest rates seemed 
to cause sharp declines in stock prices, but  this measure of near-term expected stock 
market volatility has since dropped back to le vels that are low by historical standards. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds ro se about in line with  those on comparable- 
maturity Treasuries, leaving their spreads little  changed at fairly low levels.  In contrast, 
spreads on speculative-grade bonds narrowed ab out 20 basis points over the intermeeting 
period and now stand at the bottom of thei r historical range.  Near-term spreads on 
speculative-grade bonds are particularly narrow , a sign that investor s expect corporate 
credit quality to remain strong over the next  few years, whereas forward spreads further 
out the term structure are only a shade below th eir long-term average.  In the commercial 
paper market, the thirty-day quality spread remained low.    
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
In the first quarter of 2007, earnings per shar e for firms in the S&P 500 were up 9 percent 
from four quarters earlier, the smallest gain  since 2003.  Investors had anticipated an even 
sharper deceleration in corpor ate profits, and revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year-
ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms have been  positive in May and June.  Currently, 
analysts’ forecasts imply four- quarter growth of about 5 per cent in the second quarter, but 
such forecasts are typically biased downward  in the weeks leading up to the release of 
quarterly earnings reports.          
Corporate credit quality remain ed strong overall.  Although the balance-sheet liquidity of 
public nonfinancial corporations has come down  from the peak reached  a couple of years

ago, its level in the first quarter was still hi gh by historical standards.  In addition, the 
aggregate leverage of such firms stayed near its lowest level in two decades.  The realized 
six-month trailing bond default rate remained close to zero in May, and downgrades of 
ratings on corporate bonds were again modest  in April.  In the first quarter, the 
delinquency rate on C&I loans at commercial ba nks continued to be close to its lowest 
level over the past two decades.  The near -term outlook for corporate credit quality also 
remained strong, as KMV’s aggregate year-ahead  expected bond default rate stayed at a 
historically low level in May.   
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial  corporations surged in Ma y from the already robust 
pace seen earlier this year.  While acquisi tion-related financing continued to support 
corporate bond issuance, the proceeds from a si gnificant share of recen t issues reportedly 
were for capital expenditures.  Commerci al paper outstanding was unchanged in May, 
and growth in C&I loans maintained a strong p ace.  Overall, net debt  financing increased 
sharply in May to a near-record level, and despite the recent backup in interest rates, 
declined only slightly in early June.      Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  corporations rebounded in May from a 
somewhat sluggish pace in April.  So far this  year, the pace of public equity issuance has 
been slightly above that in each of the past  few years.  Because of the rapid pace of 
leveraged buyout activity, private equity issuance is estimated  to have increased further 
in the first quarter to a leve l about double that of public i ssuance.  Even so, net equity 
issuance continued to be deeply negative in  the first quarter, as equity retired from 
estimated share repurchases and cash-financed  mergers and acquisitions remained near 
record levels.    
Commercial Real Estate  
Commercial mortgage debt e xpanded briskly again in the fi rst quarter, and the issuance 
calendar for commercial mortgage-backed secu rities (CMBS) suggests continued strength 
in the second quarter.  The spread on lowe r-rated CMBS over Treasuries has narrowed in 
recent weeks but remains elevated by historical standards.  The spread initially jumped in 
response to the difficulties in the subprime residential mortgage market, concerns about 
the adequacy of credit support for CMBS, and high leverage on recently securitized 
commercial mortgages.  The recent narrowing ha s been attributed to rating agencies’ 
clarifications of their new credit suppor t requirements, which may have reduced 
investors’ uncertainty about the adequacy of existing standards.

III-9 
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages he ld by life insurance companies and on 
those backing CMBS remained low through the first quarter, wh ereas the delinquency 
rate on commercial mortgages held at co mmercial banks rose a bit because of a 
deterioration in the performance of loans for multifamily properties and for construction and land development.  In the first quarter, rents for commercial pr operties continued to 
rise, though rather slowly, and vacancy rates rema ined at the low end of their range of the 
past couple of years.  
Household Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, in terest rates available to pr ime borrowers on both thirty-
year fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages increased along with other market 
interest rates.  Mortgage debt decelerate d in the first quarter, likely reflecting the 
slowdown in home-price appreciation over th e past year and the lower pace of home 
sales.  Growth of consumer credit thr ough April remained moderate by historical 
standards.   Delinquency rates on consumer loans and pr ime mortgages—which account for the vast 
majority of total household debt—have continue d to be low.  However, the delinquency 
rate on subprime variable-rate mortgages in creased again in April, reaching nearly 
12 percent, about double its recent low in mi d-2005.  The sharp rise in delinquencies over 
the past year is showing through to new fo reclosures, which we estimate rose 14,000, to 
nearly 325,000, in the first quarter.  Propert ies purchased with subprime variable-rate 
mortgages account for much of the rise in foreclosures.   Spreads on new subprime residential-mortgage-b acked securities (RMBS) have reversed 
most of their jump earlier this year, likely because of tighter underwriting standards on 
newer loans.  The issuance of subprime RM BS has slowed somewhat, suggesting that 
subprime mortgage borrowing has declined fr om the frenzied pace of late 2005 and the 
first half of 2006 but rema ins at a solid level. 
 The OFHEO purchase-only index of home pr ices advanced at an annual rate of 
2.2 percent in the first quarter,  about the same as in the fourth quarter.  The downward 
trajectory of expected home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets over the 
next few quarters, derived from futures quotes on the S&P/Case-Shiller house price 
index, was little changed over the intermeeti ng period.  With home prices and stock 
prices posting only small increases, the ra tio of household net worth to income ticked 
down in the first quarter.  Given the substantial rise in stock prices since the end of the

first quarter, the ratio of net worth to inco me has likely moved back up more recently.  
Supported by substantial inflows to bond funds and international equi ty funds, net flows 
to long-term mutual funds were robust again in May.   
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury completed its May refunding w ith auctions of several coupon issues, 
including a reopening of the thirty-year bond.  Bid-to-cover ratios suggest that most 
issues were well received.  There is little evid ence to date of any substantial abatement in 
demand for Treasury securities among foreign in vestors.  The six-month trailing averages 
of indirect bidding ratios and foreign allotments ticked lo wer but remained robust, and 
foreign custody holdings at the Federal Re serve Bank of New York stayed high.   
 Treasury market liquidity has remained ample desp ite the sharp increase in interest rates.   
Although trading volume in Treasury securities increased dramatically on June 7, when 
yields jumped about 15 basi s points across the coupon curve,  bid-ask spreads held at 
normal levels, and markets functioned smoothly.  Fannie Mae’s stock price climbed about 10 percent during the intermeeting period, 
supported by an announcement that it will retu rn to timely financial reporting by next 
February.  The price of Freddie Mac shares  declined about 5 percent over the same 
period.  Yields on agency debt increased relative to those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities, although spreads relative to swap rates were little changed.    
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds surged in May to a level above the robust 
first-quarter pace.  Spending on education and housing boosted new capital issuance, and 
advance refundings continued to be substantia l.  Issuance of short-term debt remained 
negligible in May, consistent with healthy state and local budgets.  A sizable amount of 
Michigan’s debt was downgr aded in May, but the credit quality of municipal bonds 
elsewhere remained solid.  The ratio of a representative municipal bond yield to a 
comparable-maturity Treasury yield stayed ne ar the low end of its range of the past 
decade.

first quarter.  The slowdown was registered ac ross most components of M2, while growth 
in currency maintained its tepid pace, la rgely because of soft foreign demand.   
 Loans at commercial banks expanded briskly in April and May, supported by lending to 
businesses through C&I and commer cial real estate loans.  Information on pricing in the 
syndicated loan market suggests that banks continued to offer very accommodative lending terms.  On the household side, banks’ hol dings of loans backed by residential real 
estate expanded at a fairly strong pace, on balance, in April and May, while consumer-
loan originations edged up only slightly.  According to the latest Call Report data, th e profitability of the commercial banking 
industry declined a bit but remained solid in th e first quarter.  The de linquency rate on all 
loans and leases ticked higher for the third st raight quarter, in part  because of a further 
rise in delinquencies on both re sidential and commercial real estate loans.  Meanwhile, 
provisioning for loan losses edged up for the second straight quarter.  However, 
delinquency and loan-loss provisioning rates stayed low by historical standards, 
suggesting that the credit quality of ba nks’ portfolios generally remained strong.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $58.5 billion in Ap ril after widening to 
$62.4 billion in March.  The narrowing of the defi cit reflected a relativ ely steep decline in 
imports of core goods, following a March surge,  and a modest increase in exports of both 
core goods and services.

In April, the value of exported goods and services increased 0.2 percent, following a 
2.6 percent increase in March.  For exports of goods, the larg est increase was in exports 
of agricultural products, which more than rebounded from a March decline; exports of 
soybeans were particularly strong.  The strength  in agricultural exports was largely offset 
by widespread declines in exports of capital  goods, which erased their March gains.  
Notably, exports of both aircraft and comput ers fell for the third straight month, and 
exports of semiconductors fell sharply. 
 
The value of imported goods and services fell 1.9 percent in April, following an outsized 
4.4 percent increase in March.  Imports of na tural gas moved up sharply and have risen 
strongly in the past three months .  Imports of petroleum were flat after surging in March.  
Among non-fuel categories, imports of autos fell sharply after a big gain in March.  
Imports of consumer goods more than retr aced their March increases, as pharmaceutical

imports fell back from an elevated March level and imports of artwork and antiques, 
another volatile category, plunged.  Imports of services were fl at after robust growth in 
March. 
 
Along with the April data, previously publis hed data were revise d beginning in 1997.  
The trade deficit in 2007:Q1 is now $707 bill ion at an annual rate , about $15 billion 
narrower than previously reported.  This larg ely reflects a signifi cant upward revision to 
exports of services.  The 2006:Q4 deficit narr owed by $7 billion, as the upward revision 
to services was partially o ffset by higher imports of goods. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In May, import prices for core goods rose 0.6 percent, 0.2 percentage 
point faster than in April.  Almost all of the reported price increase reflected a 1.6 percent 
increase for material-intensive goods.  Having risen 1.1 pe rcent in April, non-fuel 
industrial supplies pric es increased 1.8 percent in Ma y, reflecting higher prices for 
imported metals.  Prices for foods rose 0.9 percent, a step-down from the 1.3 percent 
increase recorded in April.  In contrast to these sharp price increases for material-
intensive goods, prices for imported finished goo ds were little changed in April and May.  
The exception was the price index for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors, which moved up 0.3 percent in both months.  Outside of core imports, 
prices for imported natural gas rose 2.6 percent in Ma y, and prices for imported 
computers and semiconductors fell 0.5 and 1.4 percent, respectively. 
 
The average level of core import prices in  April and May was 3½ percent at an annual 
rate (a.r.) above the first-quarter average.  Prices for material-i ntensive goods were up 
10 percent, whereas prices for finished goods increased only 1 percent.  Nearly all of the 
price increase for imported finished goods refl ected a 2¼ percent incr ease in prices for 
capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 2.7 percent in May.  The index has risen 
each of the past four months and stands 21 perc ent above its level in January.  Thus far in 
June, oil prices have edged higher, with spot prices of most grades  showing an increase 
over their May averages.  The rise in oil pri ces in May and thus far in June appears to 
reflect ongoing concerns about  oil supply, particularly from Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria.

Continued OPEC production rest raint and strong oil demand have also helped keep oil 
prices at historically elevated levels. 
 
The spot price of WTI closed  at $69.11 per barrel on June 19, up from an average of 
$63.50 per barrel in May.  Spot WTI continues to  be uncharacteristically  weak relative to 
the prices of other grades of crude because of high oil inventories in the Midwest.  The 
high inventories are the result of heavy re finery maintenance and several unplanned 
outages that have reduced dema nd for crude oil in the region.  An increased flow of oil 
from the Canadian oil sands has also helped push up inventories.  Currently, the pipeline 
infrastructure does not exist to move oil fr om the Midwest to the Gulf Coast to take 
advantage of regional price differentials.  Si nce March, the spot pri ce of Brent crude has 
risen about $3 per barrel more than WTI and closed at $72.31 per barrel on June 19. 
 
Exports.   Prices of exported core goods rose 0.2 percent in May, a step-down from the 
0.5 percent increase in April, which itself wa s a step-down from March.  The deceleration 
of core export prices was concentrated in prices of nonagricultura l industrial supplies, 
which, after increasing 1.3 percent in April, rose just 0.3 percent in May.  After falling 
1.4 percent in April, prices of agricultural exports were unchanged in May.  Prices for 
exported finished goods rose 0.2 percent in May, with noticeable gains in consumer 
goods and capital goods excludi ng computers and semiconducto rs.  Prices of exported 
computers fell 0.4 percent in May, whereas prices for semiconductors were unchanged. 
 
The average level of core export prices in  April and May was 6½ percent at an annual 
rate above the first-quarter average.  Much of the rise can be  attributed to the 14 percent 
increase in prices of nonag ricultural industrial supplies.  Agricultural prices, having 
increased 28 percent in the first quarter , were up only 3½ percent in the April-May 
period. 
 
U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $770 b illion (a.r.) in the first quarter of 2007, 
$19 billion wider than in the fourth quarter  of 2006 (revised).  The widening was due to 
increased net unilateral transfers to foreigne rs, primarily increases in U.S. Government 
grants and private remittances and other transf ers.  On net there was little movement in 
the balances on goods or services, leaving the trade deficit virtually unchanged.    
 
The investment income balance was positive $48 billion (a.r.) in the first quarter, and there were net positive revisions back to 2001.  These upward revisions were the result of 
IV-8 
two factors: (1) a change in estimated direct  investment income, especially receipts, as 
BEA incorporated new ownership information from their benchmark surveys in the 
calculations, and (2) a change in estimate d portfolio income resulting from new 
methodologies for recording interest on U. S. holdings of foreign bonds and foreign 
holdings of U.S. bonds.  In the first quarter of  this year, net investment income was only 
slightly higher than its (rev ised) fourth-quarter level.  Interest, dividend, and direct 
investment income receipts each increased in the first quarter, but total income payments 
also rose, as increases in interest and dividend payments we re only partially offset by a 
decline in direct investment payments.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Financial flows for the first quarter of 2007 s how continued strong net purchases of U.S. 
securities by private foreign investors (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Financial Transactions table).  U.S. acquis itions of foreign securities (line 5) also 
remained very strong.  Flows of U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) increased slightly 
in the first quarter, as reinvested earnings remained strong and equity investment picked 
up.  There was a more significant decline in foreign direct investment into the United 
IV-9 
States (line 7), as a bounce-b ack in retained earnings was more than offset by slower 
capital inflows and a big decline in interc ompany debt flows.  Taken together, total 
private financial inflows were somewhat smalle r in the first quarter than in the fourth 
quarter of 2006.  However, foreign official inflows (line 1) picked up notably.  The 
statistical discrepancy in the first quarter was negative $10 billion, indicating some combination of under-reporting of the current account deficit or over-reporting of net 
financial inflows.  The most recent data on securities transacti ons sh
 ow that foreign private purchases of 
U.S. securities slowed in April from the robust pace recorded in the fi rst quarter.  Foreign 
private investors on net sold Treasury securi ties (line 4a) and ma de more moderate 
purchases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 4c),  but returned to making net purchases of 
agency bonds (line 4b).  Foreign demand for equi ties (line 4d) picked up smartly, in part 
reflecting a $7 billion merger-related stock swap.  As is typically the case, most 
transactions were recorded  against the United Kingdom a nd financial centers in the 
Caribbean.      Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1) rem
 ained strong in April.  Inflows 
from China eased a bit and accounted for less th an half the official inflows recorded for 
April.  .  OPEC countries recorded a 
small net outflow in April, but these data ha ve been volatile on a monthly basis and most 
likely understate actual inflows from these coun tries.   
 
.  
 U.S. residents’ acquisitions of foreign securiti es (
 line 5) fell back in April from the very 
strong pace recorded in the first quarter.  U.S. acquisitions of foreign bonds slowed, as new issuance of bonds by foreign firms returned to a more normal level.  Demand for foreign equities (line 5b), primarily  from Asia, remained strong.   
 The volatile banking sector (line 3) posted a la rge net inflow in April, prim
 arily reflecting 
sizable inflows from affiliated banking offices located in the Caribbean.   
 The balance of payments data released in J une also showed significant revisions for 2005 
and 2006 to foreign official infl ows and foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities, 
based on newly-released results of  the survey of foreign holdings
 of U.S. securities as of 
June 2006.  The survey indicated considerably larger official holdi ngs than previously 

IV-10 
available data had suggested, especially of  Treasury securities and U.S. government 
agency bonds.  These data revisions primarily affected estimated official inflows from 
Japan, Russia, and Middle-East oil exporters.  Foreign official infl ows were revised up by 
about $60 billion in 2005 and $140 billion in 2006 , with largely offsetting reductions in 
inflows attributed to fore ign private investors.   
 
The balance of payments data also show for the first time data on net U.S. cross-border 
flows of financial derivati ves through year-end 2006 (lin e 8).  These data show 
previously unrecorded foreign inflows of  $29 billion in 2006.  The bulk of derivatives 
flows were vis-a-vis the United Kingdom, as derivatives flow s exhibit the same financial 
center bias as other data collected by the TIC system.  Data on derivatives lag those of the 
other TIC portfolio flows, and thus there are no reported transactions for the first quarter 
of 2007.    
 
The new data on derivatives inflows, signifi cant revisions to the underlying securities 
transactions data for 2006, and revisions that  reduced the size of the 2006 current account 
deficit contributed to a nota ble reduction in the statistic al discrepancy for 2006.  The 
discrepancy is now estimated to have been a negative $18 billion, compared with positive 
$141 billion prior to th e revisions.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
Over the intermeeting period, the major currenc ies index of the dollar’s exchange value 
was little changed on net.  On a bilateral ba sis, the dollar appreciat ed 3.1 percent against 
the yen and about 1 percent versus the eur o, whereas it depreciated 3.5 percent against 
the Canadian dollar.  In early June the dolla r depreciated against the Canadian dollar to 
its lowest level since 1977, following the releas e of several better than expected Canadian 
data and a hawkish statement from the Bank of Canada on May 29, warning of risks of 
rising inflation.  The option-implied volatili ties of the euro-dollar and dollar-yen 
exchange rate pairs increased slightly in early June as bond yields rose globally, but 
settled back later in the intermeeting period. 
 
Headline equity indexes rose 2 to 3 percen t on balance in the eu ro area, the United 
Kingdom, and Japan.  Share prices in severa l markets rose early in the intermeeting 
period to multiyear highs or, in some cases, even all-time highs, but they fell back in 
early June as benchmark bond yields soared globally.  Most recently, however, they have 
either largely or fully retr aced those declines.  Over th e intermeeting period, realized 
volatilities on headline equity indexes declined  on net from the elevated levels at which 
they had remained since the February-March  episode of global risk reduction.   
 
On May 10, the Bank of England raised its polic y rate 25 basis points, to 5.5 percent, and 
on June 6, the European Central Bank incr eased its policy rate 25 basis points, to 
4.0 percent.  Both moves were fully anticip ated.  The Bank of Japan and the Bank of 
Canada kept their respectiv e policy rates unchanged, also  in line with market 
expectations.  Three-month spot  interest rates increased 8 to  22 basis points in Germany, 
the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada, while ten-year nominal sovereign yields rose 
between 22 and 44 basis points in the same c ountries.   Increases in foreign yields 
generally tracked rises in dollar-b ased yields, as market participants seemed to scale back 
expectations of a prospectiv e slowdown in the U.S. econom y and policy easing.  Yields 
on inflation-indexed sovereign bonds rose almo st as much as nominal yields did during 
the intermeeting period, except in the United Kingdom where inflation breakeven rates 
rose 16 basis points.  Although the realized volat ility of the ten-year U.S. Treasury picked 
up in the intermeeting period, r ealized volatility changed l ittle on balance in Germany 
and Japan. 
 
The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value ag ainst the currencies of our other important 
trading partners declined 0.7 percent over the intermeeting pe riod.  The dollar depreciated 
IV-15 
6 percent against the Brazilian real, with much of the move occurring following news 
that Standard & Poor’s had ra ised Brazil’s long-term soverei gn credit rating from BB to 
BB+, only one notch below investment grad e.  The Brazilian Bovespa index and the 
Mexican Bolsa index rose about 8 and 9 percen t, respectively.  In emerging Asia, Korea’s 
main equity index rose 12 percent on ba lance, and the main indexes of Taiwan, 
Singapore, and Thailand stock exchanges incr eased between 4 and 10 percent.  On May 
30, China’s Shanghai Composite equity index plunged on news of an increase in the 
securities trading tax, but it has since retraced  those losses.  On balance, the Shanghai 
Composite index rose 4 percent over the intermeeting period.  Emerging market bond 
spreads were little changed over the period. 
 
On May 18, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC)  widened the width of the renminbi’s 
intraday trading band against the U.S. dolla r from +/-0.3 percent to +/-0.5 percent.  
Market participants viewed this announcemen t as a signal that the Chinese authorities 
may permit slightly more intraday volatility in the exchange rate.  Additionally, the PBoC 
increased its benchmark one-year lending and de posit rate floors, and it also raised the 
reserve requirement ratio.  The renminbi appreciated on net 1 percen t versus the dollar 
over the intermeeting period.  On June 13, the Treasury Department released its 
semiannual report on the currency policies of U. S. trading partners, in which it did not 
designate China a manipulator of its currency. 
 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand issued a communiqué on June 11 confirming that it had intervened in the foreign exchange ma rket for the first time since 1985.  The New 
Zealand dollar, which had appreciated about  3½ percent since early  May, depreciated 
almost 2 percent against the U.S. dollar on the day of the intervention.  However, it 
largely retraced that move over the following few days. 
  
The Desk did not intervene during the peri od for the accounts of the System or the 
Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
The major advanced foreign economies posted so lid growth in the first quarter.  Real 
GDP growth rebounded sharply in Canada from a disappoi nting fourth quarter, and 
growth picked up in the United Kingdom as well.  In both Japan and the euro area, 
growth slowed from a robust fourth quarter,  but remained above potential rates.  On 
average, real GDP in the advanced foreign ec onomies advanced at an annual rate of  
3.3 percent in the first quarter. 
 
Current-quarter indicators remain upbeat, including unemployment rates, which have 
edged down or remain quite low.  Coupled w ith firm consumer and business sentiment in 
the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada, total foreign industrial GDP is not 
expected to decelerate much in the current quarter. 
 
Elevated inflation in both the United Kingdo m and Canada continues to concern their 
respective central banks, while euro-area inflation continues to hover close to, but below, 
2 percent.  In Japan, headline inflation return ed to zero after dipping back into negative 
territory earlier in the year.  The Europ ean Central Bank and the Bank of England each 
raised their policy interest rates over the pa st month, with indications of some further 
tightening to come.  Recent hawkish statemen ts by the Bank of Canada have led market 
participants to price in policy tightening in the near future. 
 
Japanese GDP rose 3.3 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter.  As anticipated, growth was led 
by household and external demand.  This ma rked the second consecutive quarter of 
strong consumption growth, perhaps signali ng that households have shaken off the 
tentativeness shown for much of last year.  Ho wever, just as consumption appears to have 
recovered, private investment decelerated sharply from strong growth in 2006, at odds 
with the optimistic investment plans reported in the March Tankan survey.

Shipments of investment goods and private mach inery orders both rose in April, perhaps 
pointing to a rebound in investment in the sec ond quarter.  Industrial production fell in 
April even as shipments rose, leading to a reduction in inventories and a slight 
diminishment of the inventories-to-sales ratio.  However, the inventor ies-to-sales ratio for 
information and communications equipment has risen sharply in recent months and may 
pose a risk.  Indicators of consumption have been positive; household expenditures and 
new car registrations have both advanced.  Public works orders fell 13 percent in April and real exports fell 3 percent, suggesting that public spending will remain weak and that the contribution from the external sector ma y decelerate from the first quarter’s rapid 
pace. 
 
Consumer prices rose in April, thanks in part to a jump in fresh food prices, and the 
twelve-month rate of headline in flation returned to zero after two months of deflation.  
However, the twelve-month rate of core in flation remained slightly negative, and May 
figures for Tokyo were flat, indicating little inflationary pressure in the short term.  
Nominal wages continued to decline, falling 1.7 percent over the year to April, despite a 
fall in the unemployment rate  to 3.8 percent, the lowest rate in nearly ten years.

Euro-area  GDP growth slowed to a 2.4 percent (a .r.) pace in the first quarter from 
3.5 percent in the previous quarter.  Fixed investment and inventory accumulation each 
contributed about 2 percentage points to gr owth.  However, net exports subtracted a 
similar amount, as export growth slowed significantly and imports co ntinued to grow at a 
robust pace.  Private consumption was a sma ll drag on growth, mostly as a result of 
Germany’s VAT-related drop in consumer spe nding.  At the country level, German and 
Italian GDP growth slowed substantially, wh ereas French GDP continued to expand at 
about a 2 percent pace.

Euro-area economic growth appears to have  quickened in the current quarter, with 
household spending showing signs of strength.  In April, German retail sales rebounded 
back to their fourth-quarter level, and euro-area retail sales rose for the third straight month.  Sentiment in the euro-area retail tr ade sector picked up sharply in May, as 
retailers reported a sizable drop in the volume of stocks on hand.  Euro-area consumer 
sentiment in May posted its greatest one-mont h increase in nine years.  Consumers 
reported a substantial improvement in their em ployment expectations, consistent with the 
further decline in the unemployment rate registered in April.  Consumers also

reported a rosier view of future economic prosp ects, but also a dramatic increase in their 
savings at present. 
 
Industrial confidence pulled back  a bit in May from April’s record high but remained 
above the first-quarter level.  Germany’s IFO business climate index was steady in May 
at a level just below its post-reunification high last December.  In contrast to the strong 
confidence readings, euro-area industrial production (excluding construction) declined in 
April, after moderate gains in February a nd March.  The April decline was widespread 
across sectors and countries, with  German output falling the most. 
 
Euro-area consumer prices rose 1.9 percen t in May on a twelve-month basis.  Core 
inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) also stood at 1.9 percent in May, 
continuing its upward trend since last summer.  Liquidity growth in the euro area has 
remained high.  In April, the twelve-month change in euro-area M3 was 10.4 percent, 
down just a bit from the seventeen-year high registered in March.  Loans to the private 
sector also rose more than 10 percent (on a twelve-month basi s) in April, but this was 
down 1 percentage point from last fall’s pace. 
 
The European Central Bank raised its key pol icy interest rate ¼ percentage point to 
4 percent  on June 6 in a move widely expected by  financial markets.  President Trichet 
said after the meeting that ECB monetary policy is “still on the accommodative side, 
given the favorable economic conditions.”  He added that the ECB will “monitor 
conditions closely,” instead of “very closely,” which has been interpreted to mean that 
the policy stance is now  close to neutral. 
 
In the United Kingdom , real GDP rose 2.9 percent (a.r.)  in the first quarter, a pace 
similar to its 2006 average.  Fixed investme nt and private consumption both remained 
firm, although both decelerated from the prev ious quarter.  A drawdown of inventories 
subtracted from growth, but was much less of a drag than in the prev ious two quarters.  
Exports and imports both declined, with ne t exports making a zero contribution to GDP 
growth.  The service sector remains the main driver of growth, with output in the first quarter up 3.5 percent from a year earlier; activity in financial services boomed 
10 percent over that period.

Indicators for the second qua rter suggest continued str ong growth.  Retail sales on 
average in April and May rose about 1 percen t from the first-quarter level, somewhat 
faster than the ½ percent pace in the firs t quarter.  Consumer confidence improved in 
May as households were more optimistic about  their personal financ ial situation as well 
as the general economic outlook over the next tw elve months.  Investment intentions in 
both the service and manufacturing sectors were at decade-high levels in May according 
to the Bank of England Agents’ Summary of  Business Conditions, a survey of U.K. 
private businesses. 
 
Headline inflation slid to 2.5 percent in May, still well above the Bank of England’s 
target.  Prices for gasoline and electric ity fell 2 percent between April and May, 
following a 1.6 percent decline the previous month; these declines were the primary 
reason for the moderation in the headline rate .  House price infla tion (on a twelve-month 
basis) remained elevated at around 10 percen t in May.  However, the number of mortgage 
loans approved for house purchases fell nearly 10 percent in the three months to April. 
 
Wage inflation remains contained.  Measur es of average earnings, both including and 
excluding bonuses, were 3.3 percent higher than  a year earlier in April.  Both the 
employment rate and the participation rate fe ll slightly in the first quarter.  The Labor 
Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in March, unchanged since last September.  The claimant count ticked down to 2.7 percent in May.

The Monetary Policy Committ ee raised the Bank Rate to 5.5 percent on May 10.  It 
noted, however, that “the margin of spare cap acity in firms appears limited and there are 
signs that businesses are more able to push th rough price increases,” and that relative to 
the 2 percent target, “the risks to the outlook for inflation in the medium term 
consequently remain tilted to the upside.” 
 
In Canada, real GDP grew 3.7 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, up sharply from the 
1.5 percent advance in the previous quart er.  A resumption of positive inventory 
accumulation, following virtually zero inventor y build in the fourth quarter, was a 
primary reason for the turn-a round in headline growth.  C onsumer spending maintained 
its strength, but investment in  non-residential structures a nd equipment softened for the 
second consecutive quarter, after outsized gains the past se veral years.  Residential 
investment, in contrast, grew a healthy 7.5  percent, its fastest pace in a year, after 
declining each of the previous  three quarters.  Exports and imports each expanded; taken 
together, net exports made a small negative contribution to growth.

The few available indicators for the second quarter point to slower, though still firm, 
growth.  The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index rose in May.  The nominal merchandise 
trade surplus expanded in April; nominal imports fell, but nominal exports were little changed from the previous month.  In April,  real manufacturing shipments continued to 
edge up from last October’s low, though new or ders slipped from their level in the first 
quarter.  The composite index of leading indi cators rose again in May.  The average level 
IV-31 
of housing starts through Apr il and May was virtually unchanged from the first-quarter 
average and has moved little over the past year.  Nonetheless, housing starts still remain 
high compared with demographic fundamentals. 
 
After total employment expanded 1 percent in the first quarter , the largest quarterly gain 
in nearly five years, employment growth through April and May wa s essentially zero.  
However, full-time employment, which has been  especially strong the past two years, 
surged again in May.  The unemployment ra te in May held steady at 6.1 percent, a 
thirty-three-year low, but tw elve-month wage inflation re mained tame at 2.8 percent. 
 
In April and May, the twelve-month rate of  consumer price inflation was 2.2 percent,  
above the mid-point of the Bank of Canada’s target range of 1 to 3 percent.  Gasoline 
prices at the pump rose 5.5 percent between April and May, accounting for most of the 
increase in the all-items index.  The twelve-m onth rate of core inflation, which excludes 
the eight most volatile component s and the effects of changes in  indirect taxes, moderated 
to 2.2 percent in May from 2.5 percent in Apr il.  Continuing to ex ert upward pressure on 
the core index is homeowners’ replacemen t costs (which are estimated using, among 
other data, prices for new homes); although re placements costs decelerated in May, they 
continued to show strong grow th.  The twelve-month rate of change of new home prices 
edged below 9 percent in April, conti nuing its moderation since last summer.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent data indicate that economic activity remains strong in emerging market 
economies.  Although growth in China and Indi a appears to be moderating from the very 
high rates in the first qua rter, the pace of expansion in As ia generally remains robust.  In 
Latin America, indicators for Mexico suggest some recovery from a marked slowdown in 
the first quarter.  Inflation has picked up in Ch ina and has continued to rise in Venezuela, 
but on average, has remained little ch anged elsewhere in the emerging world. 
 
In China , second-quarter indicators point to further strong GDP growth.  The combined 
trade surplus for April and May was about $265 billion (s.a.a.r.), up from $250 billion in the first quarter as a result of strong exports.  In April and May, twelve-month growth in 
nominal fixed investment continued to exceed  25 percent, and retail sales were up more 
than 15 percent.  However, industrial production in April and May was little changed from its value in previous months, sugges ting some moderation of  growth from its 
blistering pace in the first quarter. 
 
After moderating a touch in April, twelve -month consumer price inflation rose to 
3.5 percent in May, due mostly to increases in food prices.  Food prices, which account 
for about one-third of the consumption basket , soared 8.3 percent in May from a year ago 
as rising grain prices and an outbreak of disease among hogs contributed to an increase in the price of meat, particular ly pork.  Although non-food price in flation remained stable at 
around 1 percent in May, concerns are be ginning to emerge among policymakers that 
food price increases will put pr essure on wages and fuel broade r inflationary pressures.  
Chinese authorities tightened monetary pol icy again in mid-May, raising benchmark 
lending rates and the banks’ reserve requireme nts.  They also increased bank deposit 
rates, which in real terms, had turned nega tive recently.  The authorities also announced, 
effective May 21, a widening of the renminbi’s  intra-daily trading band against the dollar 
from +/- 0.3 percent to +/- 0.5 percent.  (This band represents the ra nge of the deviation 
that the renminbi can make in a particular day against the dollar from the central banks’ 
daily morning fixing.)  However, it is questi onable how much more appreciation this will 
bring in practice, since the pr evious limit of 0.3 percent was hardly ever reached.  So far 
this year, the Shanghai stock market index is up more than 60 percent, following an 
increase of 130 percent last year, reinfo rcing concerns abou t an asset bubble.

In Hong Kong, real GDP growth fell in the first qua rter, reflecting an apparent slowdown 
in investment spending.  In addition, the valu e of both exports and imports was about flat.  
In April, separate data on the quantity of trade shows that exports rose, while imports 
edged down, suggesting a mild pickup in act ivity in this entrepôt economy.  The 
unemployment rate remained steady near its lowest level in a decade.  Twelve-month 
inflation fell to under 2 percent in April as a result of a rent co ncession on public housing, 
which is scheduled to expire in six months.

In Taiwan , first-quarter output dece lerated noticeably as a re sult of weaker domestic 
demand.  For the current quarter, indicators are mixed.  The combined merchandise trade 
surplus for April and May narrowed, and e xport orders for electronic products edged 
down in April from a high March reading.  On  the other hand, April industrial production 
was up from the first-quarter level, suggesting a recove ry going forward.  In May, 
twelve-month consumer price inflation fell to  zero, held down by reductions in energy 
and food (mainly vegetables) prices.

In Korea , indicators are pointing to some improvement in performance.  April industrial 
production rebounded from its first-quarter wea kness, with notable gains in electronic 
and other high-tech sectors.  Services output rose slightly, and meas ures of consumer and 
business confidence for April and May also tu rned up.  The merchandise trade surplus, 
though still sizable, narrowed in April, as gain s in imports surpassed those in exports.  
The smaller merchandise trade balance and a ri sing deficit in services contributed to a 
widening in the current account deficit.  Recent twelve-month consumer price inflation 
has fluctuated around the lower end of the Bank of Korea’s 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent 
target range.  The Bank of Korea left polic y rates unchanged at it s early-June meeting, 
but signaled a tightening bias, in part reflecting concern over rising bank lending, 
especially to small- and medium-size enterprises. 
 
The soaring stock market got an additional boost in mid-June as a key parliamentary 
committee approved the Capital Market Integration act.  The act, scheduled for a full vote 
soon, will simplify regulations across instituti ons, allow for a wider range of financial 
products, and remove barriers separating brokering, futures trading, and asset 
management.

Indian  real GDP soared 13.1 percent in the firs t quarter, with strength widespread.  
Growth in construction and se rvices was particularly robu st, and even agriculture, a 
traditionally slow-growing sector, posted doubl e-digit gains.  More recently, industrial 
production was flat in April, after surging in  March.  Inflation continued to decelerate, 
likely reflecting the effect of government po licies in late spring that lowered domestic 
prices for a number of products  including fuel, as well as prev ious tightening of monetary 
policy and recent exchange rate appreciation.  The trade balance worsened considerably 
in April as imports jumped more than exports.

Overall, economic activity in the ASEAN region continued to expa nd at a robust pace in 
the first quarter.  Real GDP rose over 10 pe rcent in the Philippines, 7½ percent in 
Singapore, and about 5 percent in Malaysia and Thailand.  Growth was generally 
supported by strong domestic demand and, in some cases, gains in net exports.  In Indonesia, however, a contracti on in agriculture c ontributed to a moderation of activity.  
Recent data have been mixed, but on balance suggest a continued expansion of activity 
going forward.  Trade balances generally fell  so far in the second quarter, and April 
industrial production was down in Thaila nd, but up in Indonesi a, Malaysia, and 
Singapore. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation acro ss the region continued to be subdued, owing 
to a lower contribution from energy prices, and in some countries, the unwinding of 
previous food prices increases and appreciati on of exchange rates.  Citing the moderation 
in inflation and the need to stimulate dome stic demand, the Bank of Thailand lowered its 
interest rate 50 basis points in May, and Bank Indonesia lowe red rates by 25 basis points 
in May and again in June. 
 
On May 30, the constitutional court of Thailand ruled that the Thai Rak Thai party of former Prime Minister Thaksin violated electi on laws during last year ’s general elections. 
It ordered the dissolution of the party and banned 111 members of its executive 
committee, including Prime Minister Thaksin, from  political activities for five years.  The 
ruling was viewed as politically motivated a nd is expected to he ighten and prolong the 
political tension in the country.

In Mexico , economic activity continued to decelera te in the first quarter.  Real GDP 
growth fell to 0.6 percent, owing mainly to  continuing weakness in manufacturing output, 
particularly in the automobile sector, and moderation in construction activity, which had 
been a main source of growth in previous quarters.  Activity in the services sector 
remained solid.  More recently, industrial pr oduction rebounded somewhat in April from 
its first-quarter level, sugges ting some recovery in activity.  
  
Twelve-month headline inflation was 4 percen t in May, slightly lower than expected, as 
prices of tortillas and other corn products continued to decline from their January peaks, 
partially reflecting price-restra int agreements that the government brokered with retailers 
and producers.  These agreements, which we re initially negotiated in January, were 
renewed in late April and will last until mid-August.  May marks the ninth consecutive month with twelve-month inflation at or slig htly above the upper limit of the Bank of 
Mexico's 2-to-4 percent inflation target ra nge.  Nonetheless, the central bank decided 
during its late-May meeting not to tighten mone tary policy, as it expects inflation to fall 
back well within the target range soon.  It signaled a further tightening of policy might 
occur if inflation does not recede as expected.

Brazilian  real GDP growth moderated to 3.1 per cent in the first quarter from 4.3 percent 
in the fourth as the appreciation of the real weighed on the external sector.  The weaker 
external sector tempered the effect on GDP of strong growth  in government expenditures, 
domestic investment, and services.  More recently, indicators have been mixed, but on 
balance, suggest a pickup in activity.  In April, industrial production was little changed, 
but trade balances for April and May rose c onsiderably from the first-quarter level, 
supported by high prices for exported commodities.  Indicators for consumer and 
business confidence were also positive in Ma y.  Twelve-month cons umer price inflation 
remained subdued as the appreciation of the real helped contain inflationary pressures.  
 
On June 6, the central bank reduced its policy rate, the Selic Rate, ½ percentage point to 
12 percent.  On June 11, the central bank enact ed several measures to limit short dollar 
positions in the banking system in an effort to curb capital inflows and stem the appreciation of the real.  International reserv es are estimated to ha ve risen sharply from 
$85 billion at end-2006 to $150 billion in early Ju ne as the central ba nk intervened in the 
foreign exchange market.

In Venezuela, real GDP contracted 2.3 percent in the first quarter following three years 
of double-digit growth fueled by high petroleum revenues and expansionary fiscal and 
monetary policies.  Pretroleum output, which accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, 
declined 5.3 percent.  Twelve-month consumer  price inflation conti nued to rise, reaching 
nearly 20 percent in May despite various measures  to contain it.  Inflation has been fueled 
by a 30 percent depreciation of the bolivar in th e parallel market since late 2006.  In late 
May, in an attempt to support the bolivar, the government si gnaled that it would issue 
more dollar-denominated bonds and sell do llar-denominated Argentine and Bolivian 
sovereign bonds to local investors.  The do llar-denominated bonds are attractive because 
the government allows investors to purchase them using bolivar es at the official exchange 
rate, which in mid-June, was considerably highe r than the exchange rate in the parallel 
market. 
 
In mid-June, officials asserted and then later denied that the government is studying whether to buy back all of  its sovereign bonds that ha ve clauses requiring IMF 
membership as part of the government’s stra tegy of exiting the IMF.  Venezuela has an

In Turkey , indicators suggest that activ ity continued to slow in th e first quarter.  Average 
industrial production grew just 0.6 percent in the first quarter, considerably lower than its 
fourth-quarter pace, and the trade deficit widened.  The weakness appears to have 
persisted so far in the second quarter.  Industrial production for April was down, and the 
trade deficit remained large. 
 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation e dged down in May but remains well above the 
central bank’s 2007 target of 4 percent.  The political situat ion has stabilized somewhat, 
although tensions will likely increase as the July 22 general election nears.  EU accession 
remains stalled, and further progress will likely depend on the outcome of the election.  The IMF remains critical of the expansionary fiscal policy and wage increases that are occurring in the r un-up to the election.

In South Africa , real GDP rose nearly 5 percent in the first quarter.  The most recent 
indicators for the second quart er have been somewhat mixe d.  Mining production was up 
in April and the trade deficit narrowed, but manufacturing production was down.  The 
targeted CPIX twelve-month infl ation rate rose to 6.3 percen t in April, due mostly to 
higher energy and corn prices.  The April inflation rate breached the central bank’s 
3 to 6 percent target range, prompting th e South African Reserv e Bank to raise its 
benchmark interest rate  ½ percentage point. 
 
Since June 1, a public sector wage dispute has erupted into massive strikes throughout the 
country, raising concerns a bout their effect on economic activity.  The Congress of 
South African Trade Unions (COSATU), the organization leading the protests, originally 
demanded a 12 percent cost-of-living pay increase, double the in crease proposed by the 
government.  Of late, COSATU has lowered its demand to 10 percent and the government has raised its offer to 7.25 percent, but prospects for an agreement remain uncertain.
