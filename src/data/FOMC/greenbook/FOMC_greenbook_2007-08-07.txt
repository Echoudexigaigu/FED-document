Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2 pe rcent, on average, over the first half of the 
year; and, the drag from housing and the recent turbulence in financial markets 
notwithstanding, the available in dicators taken as a whole ar e consistent with economic 
activity posting further moderate gains in the near term.  In  particular, employment and 
real income have been growing solidly, on ba lance, so far this year, indicators of 
household and business sentiment remain s upportive, and inventories appear to be 
reasonably well aligned with final demand.  Top-line inflation receded in June, while 
core inflation rose at about its  average pace over the past year. 
 
Labor Market Developments   
Labor demand has continued to expand at a mo derate pace.  Private payroll employment 
rose 92,000 in June and was led by gains in the education and health services and in the 
leisure and hospitality industries.  Constructi on employment also rose  in June despite the 
ongoing contraction of activity in that sector , a continuation of the anomalous pattern 
observed since early 2007.  For the second quarter  as a whole, private payrolls increased 
an average of 115,000 employees per month, the same rate as in the first quarter.  
Reflecting the growth in payroll employmen t, as well as a small lengthening of the 
workweek, aggregate hours of private producti on or nonsupervisory workers rose at an 
annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate  held steady at 4.5 percent in June and 
has been largely unchanged for nine months.  The labor force participation rate edged up 
to 66.1 percent in June.  The participation rate had increased between early 2005 and the 
end of 2006; since then it has been moving down, on average, although it is still above 
the level observed in early 2005.    Other gauges of labor demand have remained  in a range consistent with continued 
moderate employment growt h.  Indicators of layoffs—suc h as initial claims for 
unemployment insurance, the s hort-term job losers rate fr om the household survey, the 
layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, and 
announcements of downsizing plans—all sugges t that job losses have been relatively 
subdued recently.  On the hiri ng side, most measures of hi ring plans, job openings, and 
job availability, although off a bit from recent peaks, remain at relatively high levels by 
historical standards.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) increased  at a moderate pace in the second quarter after little 
change, on net, over the previous two quart ers.  A smaller drag from inventory 
liquidation and a modest improvement in net trade appear to have been the primary 
contributors to IP growth in the second quarter after subt racting from growth in the 
previous quarter.  Manufacturi ng IP appears poised to post solid gains in the near term, as 
days’ supply of inventories are now at co mfortable levels in most industries and 
indicators of activity, including the available weekly data fo r July, have shown continued 
strength.  Manufacturing production popped up 0.6 percent in June after no change in May; for the 
second quarter as a whole, output  increased at an annual rate of nearly 3½ percent.  The 
factory operating rate rose in  June to 80.3 percent, slig htly above its 1972–2006 average 
but below its recent peak last August.   
 After dropping for six consecuti ve quarters, the output of  motor vehicles and parts 
jumped at an annual rate of 13.3 percent in the second quarter.  Light vehicle assemblies 
rebounded from a very low first-quarter pace, while assemblies of medium and heavy trucks plunged further in the second quarter in  the wake of new Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) regulations on truck engines.  W ith inventories of domestic light vehicles 
fairly well aligned with sales at the end of the second quarter, production schedules for 
the third quarter call for the pace of assemblies to step up again.  However, these plans 
may prove too aggressive if demand does not pick up when the new 2008 model-year 
vehicles are introduced this fall.    Output in high-tech industri es recorded another compar atively lackluster gain, on 
balance, in the second quarter.  The output of  computers decelerated to a more moderate 
pace after a first-quarter surge in production related to the retail release of Microsoft’s 
new Vista operating system.  Gains in pr oduction of communications equipment also 
slowed appreciably last quarter  after stepping up sharply in the first quarter.  The output 
of semiconductors, which fell at the beginning of the year, rose only modestly in the 
second quarter.  Chip production was lik ely restrained by softer demand from 
downstream industries and by the manufactur ers’ efforts to reduce their bloated 
inventories.  Stocks still a ppear somewhat elevated, and revenue guidance from Intel is 
consistent with only moderate increases in the output of micropro cessors in the third 
quarter.  Among other near-term indicator s, National Association for Business 
Economics (NABE) and CIO magazine surveys of business plans for future spending on 
high-tech equipment improved some what in the second quarter.   
 Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts,  and high-tech products, output increased 
0.4 percent in June and was up at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the second quarter.  
After a series of declines, output of durable  consumer goods rose at a 2.7 percent pace, 
boosted by a rebound in the production of a ppliances, furniture, carpeting goods, and 
home improvement products.  The production of business equipment moved up moderately in the second quarter and was s upported by continued strength in commercial 
aircraft production.  The output  of construction s upplies rose at an annual rate of 
3.5 percent in the second quarter  after declining for three co nsecutive quarters; increases 
in the output of supplies typi cally associated with nonresiden tial construction appear to 
account for the second-quarter gain, while supplies associated with residential 
construction continued to move down.  The out put of industrial materials moved up at a 
steady pace, aided by a rebound in demand from  downstream industries such as motor 
vehicles, other consumer durables, and nonr esidential construction, as well as by the 
return of days’ supply to its trend.    
Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity  point to continued production gains in the

real adjusted durable goods or ders increased in June.  Th e new orders diffusion index 
from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and an average of the new orders 
indexes from the various regional surveys bot h declined in July after moving up in the 
second quarter, but their levels remained consistent with moderate increases in 
manufacturing output.  Finally, the available we ekly data for July show solid gains in 
production for light motor vehicles, steel produc ts, and crude oil.  The increase in total 
IP, however, appears to have been restrained  by a decline in output at utilities.  
 
Motor Vehicles 
Demand for light motor vehicles  has softened considerably in recent months.  After 
maintaining a moderate annual rate of about 16.4 million units in the first five months of 
the year, sales in June and July averaged just 15.4 million units, their slowest two-month 
pace in almost two years.   
.1  Consumers’ anxiety 
about rising fuel prices and di sappointment with the level of incentives being offered also 
appear to have played a role in restraining demand.  So far this year, the sales decline has 
been concentrated in light trucks, a move that was felt primarily by domestic producers. 
 The near-term indicators of vehicle demand suggest that sales should improve a bit from their recent pace but remain tepid.  Consumers’ perceptions of car-buying conditions in 
the Reuters/University of Michigan survey  recovered somewhat in July, although they 
remained at the low end of readings taken over the past year.  The modest improvement 
in July mostly reflected a decline in the number of survey respondents who cited high 
gasoline prices as the reason that car-buying co nditions were poor.  Data from J.D. Power 
and Associates show that the average value of  incentives for light vehicle purchases has 
changed little in recent months.  At the end of July, however, Genera l Motors introduced 
several new zero-percent fina ncing programs in an effort to boost sagging demand, a 
move that in the past has induced simila r programs at the othe r large firms.

Consumer Spending 
The pace of consumer spending slowed considerably in the second quarter.  The 
step-down came on the heels of a surge in pur chases around the turn of  the year, and at a 
time when a jump in energy prices was eroding the purchasing power of household 
income gains.  Goods purchases, in partic ular, decelerated shar ply as motor vehicle 
purchases dropped in the second quarter a nd real spending on ot her goods was subdued.  
Although increases in outlays on services slow ed some last quarter as well, they are 
estimated to have continued advancing at a moderate  pace. 
 Although the spike in energy pri ces damped real income growth in the second quarter, 
solid gains in wages and salaries and earlier increases in the stock market have generally 
been supportive of consumer expenditures.  Re al income growth was quite robust in the 
previous two quarters, and, despite the c ontinued softness in house prices, household 
wealth moved markedly higher in the second quarter—mostly on the strength of the stock 
market, although equity prices have moved sh arply lower more recently.  Because the 
growth of outlays surpassed th e change in disposable inco me in the second quarter, the 
personal saving rate fell to 0.6 percent.  Apart from sales of motor vehicles, other av ailable indicators of spending in the third 
quarter are limited but seem to be a bit more upbeat.  In particular, th e latest readings on 
consumer sentiment and weekly data on ch ain store sales both poi nt to a pickup in 
outlays early in the third quarter.  In a ddition, weekly data on the volume of gasoline 
sales show an increase for July.   
Housing  
The housing sector remains very weak.  Demand has been further restrained of late by 
higher interest rates—since mid-April, rate s on thirty-year fixed -rate mortgages have 
risen about 50 basis points—and by increasingly tight lending  standards in the subprime 
market.  New home sales were down 11 percent and existing home sales down 
6½ percent in the second quarter from their aver age levels in the second half of last year.  
With production flat despite the slower p ace of demand, the inventory situation has 
shown little improvement, on balance,  since the end of last year. 
 Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand—most notably, the index of pending 
home sales—have deteriorated, on balance, in the past few months.  One exception is the 
four-week moving average of th e mortgage purchase index, wh ich has risen considerably,

on net, since mid-April.  However, the rise  in this index may be somewhat misleading 
because of distortions relate d to the recent developments in subprime mortgage markets.2 
 
Despite the apparent falloff in demand, ne w housing production has moved sideways this 
year.  Single-family starts held steady in June at an annual rate of 1.15 million units.  In contrast, adjusted permit issuance slipped furt her to an annual rate of 1.05 million units.  
Starts generally have tracked higher than  permits since early 2006, and builders have 
evidently made up the shortfall by drawing down the sizable backlog of unused permits 
that had accumulated over the course of the housing boom.  Hi storically, such gaps have 
led starts to adjust toward permits.  Moreover, inventories of unsold new homes remain stubbornly elevated relative to sales—about  50 percent higher th an the upper bound of 
the fairly tight range of months’ supp ly values recorded between 1997 and 2005.
3  All 
told, these indicators suggest that single-family construction will likely decline further in the coming months.  Multifamily starts in June  were at an annual rate of 316,000 units, in 
line with readings seen so far this year a nd at the low end of the relatively narrow range 
the values have occupied for the past ten years or so. 
 
The latest readings on house prices have continued to show some deceleration.  In the 
first quarter, the purchase-only version of the repeat price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of Federal Hous ing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was 
3 percent higher than its level a year earlier, a considerably smaller increase than the 10 percent appreciation posted over the preceding four-quart er period.  The ten-city 
version of the Case-Shiller repeat-price inde x has decelerated even more noticeably and 
has shown negative year-over-y ear rates of change for ev ery month this year through 
May.
4  Estimates of the average price of exis ting homes sold—which are available on a 
more timely basis than the other measures but  are not quality adjusted—showed the price  
                                                 
2 Among other things, the mortgage purchase index does not sample applications taken by mortgage 
brokers, who issue the overwhelming majority of subprime loans.  Therefore, the index may not adequately 
reflect the dramatic falloff in new credit to this por tion of the market.  In addition, the index measures 
mortgage applications  rather than approvals ; because mortgage lending standards have become tighter this 
year for many borrowers, a smaller proportion of mortgage applications are likely to have been approved, 
and some borrowers may have applied to a larger number of lenders for a given loan.

Diego, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.

little changed in June relative to its level tw elve months earlier.  Similarly, the constant-

sales, square footage, and other readily m easurable attributes—w as just 0.6 percent 
higher in the second quarter than four qua rters earlier, down from the 3.9 percent

Equipment and Software  
Real business outlays for equipment and software (E&S) excluding transportation 
equipment posted a solid increase in the sec ond quarter after having b een flat, on net, in 
the preceding two quarters.  Smoothing through the ups and downs, the recent pace has been modest and roughly consistent with the lackluster performance of the fundamental 
determinants of real E&S spending.  Busine ss output growth has stepped down somewhat 
since early last year, and while the user cost of high-tech capital has continued to decline, the trajectory is not particularly impressive  by historical standard s.  Moreover, although 
firms retain ample cash in reserve to fina nce investment, credit costs for lower-grade 
borrowers have increased.  Real business outlays for high-tech E&S decel erated in the second quarter after a brisk 
first-quarter increase.  Expenditures on computers and software rose at  an annual rate of 
around 5½ percent last quarter after a very rapid Vista-influenced gain in the first quarter.  
Similarly, outlays on communicatio ns gear posted a solid 11 percent gain in the second 
quarter, on top of a much larger gain in th e first quarter.  However, guidance from 
telecommunications service providers suggests only modest growth in spending on communications equipment for 2007 as a whole.  Business outlays on transportation equipment dropped at an annual rate of more than 
28 percent in the second quarter, the third cons ecutive quarterly declin e.  Business-sector 
spending for motor vehicles fell,  
.  In additi on to the payback from the large number of 
truck sales that were pull ed into 2005 and 2006 ahead of the new EPA regulation on 
diesel engines, industry contacts also believe that part of the weakness in the sector is due  
                                                
 
5 Even these quality-adjusted readings on new- home price appreciation may be overstated because 
builders reportedly have stepped up their use of nonprice incentives—such as granting more-favorable 
mortgage terms, paying closing costs, and including optional upgrades at no cost—over the past year to 
bolster sales and unload inventory.

to a slump in freight shipping volumes attr ibutable to the slowdown in construction 
activity.  New orders for medium and heavy trucks, meanwhile, edged up in the second 
quarter but remained at low le vels.  Domestic spending on airc raft spiked up in the first 
quarter from a very low level and stayed  at that level in the second quarter. 
 Real spending on equipment other than high-tech  and transportation surged at an annual 
rate of about 12 percent in the second qua rter.  The second-quarter increase recouped 
more than half of the steep decline in spe nding recorded over the pr ior three quarters, and 
the rebound was led by higher spending on industr ial machinery.  Outlays for mining, oil-
field and gas-field equipment and for agricultural machinery also contributed to the second-quarter increase. 
 
Looking ahead, surveys of business conditions , such as the ISM’s monthly index and 
some regional indexes, have picked up cons iderably since earlier in the year and are 
consistent with solid growth in the near term.  The most recent reading on the capital spending diffusion index derive d from the NABE survey picked up as well.  On the side 
of restraint, orders for nondefense capita l goods excluding aircraft edged down in May 
and were flat in June. 
 
Nonresidential Construction 
Real spending on construction of nonresiden tial buildings has moved up smartly this 
year, and fundamentals in this sector remain solid.  On the basis of available data, the 
staff estimates that spending on nonresidentia l structures excluding drilling and mining 
surged at an annual rate of more th an 20 percent in the second quarter.
6  In particular, 
vacancy rates, although up somewhat in recen t quarters, are still relatively low by 
historical standards.  Moreover, the thr ee-month moving average of the diffusion index 
for architectural billings, which has some si gnal content for spendi ng six months hence, 
points to continued gains in the coming quarter s, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than 
seen so far this year.  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis  (BEA), activity in the drilling and mining 
segment jumped at an annual rate of 48 per cent in the second quarter.  This increase 
appears to be at odds with the data on the num ber of rigs in operation, which suggest that  
                                                
 
6 The June data on nonresidential construction was released after the BEA’s advance GDP estimate for 
the second quarter.  After incorporating the June da ta, we estimate that real nonresidential structures 
investment excluding drilling and mining grew 5.6 percentage points more than the BEA’s advance second-
quarter estimate.

drilling activity has been flat, on balance, so far this year.7  Moreover, anecdotal reports 
in the most recent Beige Book suggest that ince ntives for further expa nsion of drilling for 
natural gas have been damped considerably by recent price declines and by persistently 
high inventories.  
 
Business Inventories  
Businesses have made considerable progress bringing inventories more into line with 
sales.  We estimate that real nonfarm inve ntory investment excl uding motor vehicles 
increased at an annual rate of $9 billion in  the second quarter, considerably below the 
pace in the second half of last year.8  Furthermore, the ratio of manufacturing and trade 
book-value inventories relative to sales, ex cluding motor vehicles , ticked down again in 
May.  Similarly, the staff’s flow-of-goods inve ntory system suggests that inventories in 
June were well aligned with absorption of fi nal and intermediate goods.  In July, the 
number of purchasing managers who viewed their customers’ inventories as “too high” 
slightly exceeded the number who saw them as “too low.”  
Federal Government Sector  
With receipts growing about in line with nominal income and increases in outlays 
slowing appreciably, the federal budget defici t has narrowed.  Over the twelve months 
ending in June, the cumulative deficit (adjus ted for payment-timing shifts and financial 
transactions) was $173 billion, about 1¼ percen t of nominal GDP and almost $90 billion 
less than in the twelve months ending in June 2006.
9  
 The growth of tax receipts has stepped down markedly of late from the exceptionally 
strong gains seen in recent y ears.  In June, corporate reve nues were only 2 percent higher 
than their level a year earlier, reflecting the slowing growth of profits .  Individual income  
                                                
 
7 To form their quarterly judgmental estimates of real spending growth in this category, the BEA 
extrapolates the quantity of drilling forward using prop rietary data from the American Petroleum Institute 
(API) on footage drilled and estimated cost per f oot, a second measure of footage drilled from the 
Department of Energy, and the number of drilling rigs in operation from Baker-Hughes.  The proprietary data from the API receive about 60 percent of the we ight in this calculation an d are not available to the 
staff. 
8 This estimate of inventory accumulation in the second quarter is $1 billion higher than the advance 
estimate by the BEA for the quarter because it incorporates data for manufacturing inventories in June that were released after the BEA’s estimate was calculated. 
9 The Administration’s Mid-Session Review of the Budget  (MSR), which was released on July 11, 
projects the deficit for fiscal 2007 to be $205 billion, narrower than the estimate of $244 billion in the 
February budget but wider than suggested by the trend for the deficit over the first nine months of the fiscal 
year.  Historically, the MSR has tended to be  too pessimistic on the current-year deficit.

and payroll tax payments in June were up 6¼ percent from their le vel a year earlier, 
compared with a 8¼ percent increase duri ng the twelve months ending in June.   
 The deceleration in federal outlays was more  pronounced than that in receipts.  Total 
spending in June was barely above its leve l in June 2006.  Spending for defense and the 
major transfer programs grew more slowly in June than their average monthly pace over 
the past year, and net interest payments in June declined a bit from their year-earlier 
level.  As measured in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), total real federal 
purchases rose briskly in the second quarter and contributed n early ½ percentage point to 
the rate of growth in real GDP .  The rise in total federal purchases primarily reflected a 
bounceback in defense purchases; nonde fense purchases edged up only a bit. 
 
State and Local Government Sector  
Healthy fiscal positions have contributed to solid increase s in expenditure s by state and 
local governments so far this year.  State a nd local employment increased an average of 
34,000 per month in the second quarter, signifi cantly above the monthly average of 
22,000 between 1997 and 2006.  Construction expend itures have been climbing relatively 
rapidly for more than a year, a nd real investment in structures  is estimated to have risen 
at a brisk annual rate of 7½ per cent in the second quarter.  Overall, the staff estimates that 
real purchases by state and local governments a dvanced at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in 
the second quarter.
10   
 While state governments are believed to have en ded the recent fiscal year in June with 
substantial cash reserves, revenues began sl owing last year, and the Census Bureau’s 
Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue  suggests that reve nues continued to 
decelerate to a more moderate pace in the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, recent 
anecdotal reports point to emerging concern by some state governments about their future 
fiscal positions.  In particular, several larg e states, including California, Illinois, and 
Pennsylvania, have struggled to enact budgets for the current fiscal year, which began on 
July 1.  Meanwhile, other states, including Maryland, are looking for ways to reduce 
expenditures below their planned levels in or der to avert deficits in the near future. 
 
                                                
 
10 The June data on state and local construction were released after the BEA’s advance GDP estimate 
for the second quarter.  We estimate that, after incorp orating the June data, real state and local purchases 
grew 0.4 percentage point more than th e BEA’s advance second-quarter estimate.

Prices 
Headline consumer price inflation slowed in June as energy prices  flattened out after 
having increased rapidly over the preceding three months.  Despite June’s favorable 
outcome, total PCE prices were up at an annual rate of about 4 percen t over the first half 
of this year, compared with 2¼ percent over the twelve months of 2006.  Outside of food 
and energy, however, core inflation slowed in the first half of this ye ar from last year’s 
upward revised pace.  Resource utilization still appears to be relatively tight, but long-run 
inflation expectations have re mained within the range that has prevailed during much of 
the past few years.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in June.  Prices of core goods 
fell 0.2 percent, bringing the decr ease in the first six months of this year to an annual rate 
of ¾ percent, a faster rate of decline than  occurred in 2006.  After rising modestly last 
year, apparel prices fell sharply in the first half of this year  and more than accounted for 
the overall deceleration in core goods prices.  Pr ices of core services rose 0.3 percent in 
June and were boosted by higher prices of housing services, particularly lodging away 
from home, which posted a sizable increase fo r the third consecutive month.  Over the 
first half of this year, prices of core services rose at an a nnual rate of about 3 percent.  
This pace was ¼ percentage point lower th an its rate in 2006, reflecting a sizable 
deceleration in owners’ equivalent rent.   Energy prices declined 0.6 percent in June after a rise of 15 pe rcent (not at an annual rate) 
over the previous three months.  This substa ntial run-up in energy prices followed very 
large declines late last year; on balance,  energy prices were up 4½ percent over the 
twelve months ending in June after rising more than 24 percent during the comparable 
period twelve months earlier.  Gasoline prices fell 1 percent in June and appear to have 
declined again in July despite marked increa ses in crude oil input costs over the same 
period.  Increased production at  gasoline refineries has booste d inventories, and gasoline 
margins, while still elevated, have fallen  well below their recent peak in May.   
 Food prices posted another large increase in June and continued to show signs of the 
pass-through of high corn prices, which have  been boosted by strong demand for ethanol.  
In the first half of this ye ar, the PCE price index for food and beverages has increased at 
an annual rate of 5¾ percent,  a sizable step-up from the 2 percent increase in 2006.  
While this pickup has been widespread, price increases for meats, poultry, eggs, and 
dairy, for which corn is the main feedstuff, ha ve been particularly la rge this year.  That 
said, recent rains and USDA reports predicting a bumper harvest have pushed corn prices

down considerably in recent weeks.  Spot pr ices for slaughter-ready cattle, for which corn 
is the major feed source, have also dropped be low their recent highs, and spot prices for 
poultry have merely flattened out in recent weeks.   Broader measures of inflation have slowed relati ve to the pace of the past few years.  In 
the second quarter, the four-quarter change in  the GDP price index was 2.7 percent, down 
¾ percentage point from the increase over the preceding four-quarter period.  GDP prices 
excluding food and energy have decelerated by a similar amount over this period.  This 
slowdown reflects both a small deceleration in core PCE pr ices over this period and a 
considerable step-down in pr ice increases for construction. 
 As measured by the Reuters/Michigan surve y, the median expectation for year-ahead 
inflation increased to 3.4 percent in June and remained at that rate in July despite declines 
in gasoline prices in both mont hs.  The median expectation for inflation over the next five 
to ten years moved back up to 3.1 percent, near the top of the narrow range that has 
prevailed over the past few years.  Infla tion compensation from TIPS five-to-ten years 
ahead has changed little sin ce the last FOMC meeting and remains at about its average 
level over the past couple of years.   Strong global demand and rising energy prices have continue d to push up the prices of 
goods at earlier stages of processing this y ear.  These prices have some, albeit small, 
predictive content for finished  goods prices.  The PPI for core intermediate materials 
increased 0.4 percent in both May and June a nd rose at an annual ra te of 4½ percent in 
the first half of this year, about the sa me as the pace over 2005 and 2006.  Commodity 
prices have continued to m ove higher since the June Green book and are up considerably 
from their levels a year earlier.  The Journal of Commerce  index of industrial materials 
has risen about 2¾ percent since the J une Greenbook, boosted in part by its energy 
components, and the Commodity Research Bu reau’s index of industrial spot prices, 
which includes excludes energy, wa s up 2 percent over the same period. 
 
Labor Costs 
The employment cost index for hourly compen sation of private industry workers rose at 
an annual rate of 3½ percent in  the three months ending in June, compared with an annual 
rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter of th is year.  This pickup reflected a modest 
rebound in employer contributions to retirement and savings pl ans after a very large drop 
in the preceding three months.  The twelve -month change in private-industry hourly 
compensation was 3.1 percent in June, up about  ¼ percentage point from the increase

over the preceding year.  The acceleration is th e result of a faster increase in wages and 
salaries—3¼ percent over the twelve months ending in June, compared with 2¾ percent 
over the year-earlier period.  ECI benefits increased at about the same rate in both 
periods; in the most recent twelve-month peri od, a marked deceleration in retirement and 
savings contributions was offset by a si zable acceleration in  nonproduction bonuses. 
 Using the most recent NIPA data, the staff estimates that compensation per hour in the 
nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter and was 
up 5¼ percent from four quarters earlier.  Th is four-quarter change is noticeably above 
the downward-revised gain of 3¾ percent pos ted over the preceding four quarters.  
Combined with a deceleration in output pe r hour over the past y ear, the compensation 
data imply that unit labor costs have continue d to trend up, with the latest four-quarter 
change at 4½ percent.  As a result, the markup of nonfarm business prices over unit labor 
costs has fallen back somewhat from its peak  last year, but it re mains well above its long-
run average.

Appendix 
II-A-1 Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 
  
The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 27, 
affected data back to the beginning of 2004.  This year’s revision mainly reflected the incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Analys is (BEA) of more-comprehensive source data.  
The four-quarter change in real GDP was revised down 0.3 percentage point in 2004, 
0.2 percentage point in 2005, and 0.5 percentage point in 2006.    Downward revisions were fairly widespread by expenditure category and did not noticeably alter 
the contour of real GDP over the revision period.   Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
are now estimated to have risen 0.3 percentage point per year more slowly during the 2004-06 
period, and that change made the largest contri bution to the overall revision to real GDP.  New 
information from annual Census surveys also show ed that outlays by state and local governments 
increased noticeably more slowly than previously estimated in all three years.  Elsewhere, the 
revisions included lower estimates of spending for residential investment in 2005 and for 
equipment and software and business inventories in 2006.  The BEA’s changes to its price indexes were gene rally small.  Core PCE inflation was revised up 
0.1 percentage point in both 2005 and 2006, with market-b ased core PCE inflation up 
0.1 percentage point in 2006 only.  However, the increase in overall GDP prices revised up by a 
larger amount because of a sizable upward revisi on to residential construction prices in 2005. 
 On the income side of the accounts, the average increase in gross domestic income was revised 
down by about the same amount as GDP; the increas e in GDI is still reported to have exceeded 
the increase in GDP by an average of 0.3 percentage  point per year over the 2004-06 period.  Real 
disposable personal income is now estimated to  have risen considerably faster because higher 
estimates of personal interest and dividend income  (derived from Internal Revenue Service data) 
more than offset a downward revision to employ ee compensation.  This higher income, together 
with the downward revisions to PCE, led the persona l saving rate to be revised up 1¾ percentage 
points, to 1.1 percent by the first quarter of 2007.   Corporate profits were revised up in 2004 and 
2005 but were revised down considerably in 2006; as a result, corporate profits as a share of GNP are now reported to have increased only modestly l ast year (and to have declined in the fourth 
quarter).  Much of last year’s downward revisi on to profits stemmed from a revision to the capital 
consumption adjustment—that is, to new BEA estimates indicating that economic depreciation 
had revised up relative to companies’ reported depreciation.  In addition, data from firms’ 
financial reports indicated a much flatter traject ory for book profits over 2006 and into the first 
quarter of 2007 than previously estimated.  The annual NIPA revision also provided informa tion about the magnitude of upcoming revisions 
to measures of productivity and compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector.  We now 
II-A-2 
estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of about 
1-3/4 percent during 2004 and 2 005 and about 1 percent in 2006 ; these estimates for 2005 and 
2006 are 0.4 percentage point and 0.7 percentage point, respectively, lower than reported earlier.  
In addition, we estimate that increases in co mpensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
will be revised down through 2006,  though by less than productivity.  The quarterly pattern of 
increases in compensation per hour now appears to  be somewhat smoother than in the data as 
currently published, but it remains highly erratic.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Mounting concerns about subprime mortgage pe rformance and credit risk more broadly 
reverberated in financial mark ets during the intermeeting period.  The value of securities 
tied to subprime mortgages plunged, and issuan ce of such securities slowed sharply.  
Risk spreads on corporate bonds widened notably, although business credit quality has 
yet to show any deterioration.  A number of  planned issues of speculative-grade bonds 
and leveraged loans, intended predominantly to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs), were 
postponed or restructured, but issuance of i nvestment-grade corporate bonds appeared 
little affected.  Broad equity -price indexes fell, on net,  over the period despite solid 
second-quarter earnings reports.  Expectations for the federal funds rate and yields on 
Treasury securities declined considerably  even though incoming economic data were 
generally seen as mixed.  
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
Market participants largely anticipated the FO MC’s decision at its June meeting to leave 
the target federal funds rate unchange d.  However, the accompanying statement 
expressed greater concern about inflation th an investors reportedly had foreseen and 
caused the expected path for policy to edge hi gher.  In addition, polic y expectations were 
boosted a bit by some favorable economic ne ws early in the intermeeting period.  
However, money market future s rates declined a little in the wake of the Chairman’s 
semiannual testimony to Congress, as inve stors reportedly focused on the downward 
revision to the Committee’s cent ral tendency forecast for real GDP growth.  Rates fell 
further amid growing apprehensi on about the risk to economic growth associated with the 
difficulties in the subprime mortgage market  and the market for low-rated corporate 
credits.  Federal funds futures currently im ply a small probability of a rate cut at the 
August FOMC meeting and roughly a 40 percen t chance of an easing by the September 
meeting.  Further out, investor s have marked down their poli cy expectations even more 
and now appear to expect about 70 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, up from 
about 30 basis points at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  By contrast, primary dealers 
in the Desk’s survey put lower odds on the prospects for near-ter m policy easing than do 
futures market participants:  Dealers reported that they placed virtually no odds on a rate 
cut at the August meeting and expect only a bout 15 basis points of  easing between now 
and the end of next year.  Measures of policy uncertainty derived from options on 
Eurodollar futures climbed notably over  the intermeeting period, and the implied 
distribution of the federal funds rate became more skewed toward lower rates.

III-3 
On balance, two- and ten-year nominal Trea sury yields fell 35 and 30 basis points, 
respectively, over the intermeeting period, in pa rt because of the decline in the expected 
path of the funds rate.  A decline in estimat ed term premiums and a notable increase in 
swap spreads since the June meeting are consis tent with reports that safe-haven demands 
also contributed to the decline in Treasury yields.  Yields on Treas ury inflation-protected 
securities declined somewhat  less than their nominal counterparts, thereby leaving 
inflation compensation a bit lower on net. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes declined about 3 percent, on net, since the June meeting 
despite generally solid second-quarter earnings reports.  Share prices of financial firms 
fell 9 percent, partly reflecting concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and 
about the effect of a potentia l slowdown in merger activit y on operating profitability.  
Share prices for retailers dr opped 5 percent on a number of warnings that sales in the 
second quarter were lower than expected.  Amid declining share prices and Treasury 
yields, the spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 
500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yi eld—a rough gauge of the equity risk 
premium—widened somewhat.  Implied vola tility on the S&P 500 index jumped to the 
top of its range over the past few years.  Conditions in corporate credit markets tig htened substantially over the intermeeting 
period.  Spreads on a traded index comprising 100 of the most liquid speculative-grade 
credit default swaps (CDS) rose about 185 basi s points, as investors pulled back from 
riskier assets.  Spreads on CDS were al so reportedly boosted by a flood of hedging 
demands from institutions that had committed to underwriting LBOs.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds increased about 110 basi s points since the June meeting and now 
stand about 150 basis points above their lows in mid-J une.  Investment-grade bond 
spreads rose about 30 basis points.  Specula tive-grade and investment-grade bond spreads 
are now at the top of their rang es over the past four years but are still below their peaks in 
2002.  Because Treasury yields declined notably since the June meeting, investment-grade yields are about unchange d despite the rise in spreads.   Liquidity in the CDS and 
corporate bond markets appeared to remain adequate.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Second-quarter earnings reports have generally  been solid.  However, most homebuilders 
disclosed substantial second-quarter losses, which stemmed in part from falling land 
prices, and several financial firms reporte d losses on assets related to subprime 
mortgages.  With about three-quarters of re ports in hand and analysts’ estimates for the 
rest, the staff projects that earnings per share for S&P 500 firms will come in about 
7 percent above year-earlier le vels.  As usual, most announcements exceeded analysts’ 
forecasts.  Regarding the near-term outlook, th e revision index of an alysts’ forecasts of 
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms was near zero in July.   
 Although some of our indicators are a bit stal e, corporate credit qua lity appears to have 
remained strong overall.  Liquidity of nonfinan cial corporate balance sheets stayed high 
by historical standards in the first quarter, and leverage for that sector remained low.  
Rating downgrades on corporate bonds continued to be modest in the second quarter, and 
the realized six-month trailing bond default rate hovered near zero in June.  KMV’s 
aggregate year-ahead expected  bond default rate stayed ne ar record lows in June; 
although we anticipate some increase in July be cause of the decline in stock prices and 
the rise in volatility, the near-term ou tlook for corporate credit quality implied by the 
KMV measure almost surely remains favorable.  
Business Finance 
The influence of tighter financial conditions  in corporate credit markets has been 
concentrated in financings slated for LBOs.  Continuing the trend that began in late June, 
a number of high-yield bond and leveraged loan issues inte nded to finance LBOs were 
delayed or restructured over the intermee ting period.  Issuance of high-yield bonds 
slowed but did not stop in July.  Leverage d loan issuance also fell considerably, as 
investors have become uncertain about the va luation of securities issued by structured 
entities (such as collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations), the primary buyers of leveraged loans in recent years.  Investment-grade bond issuance 
appeared little affected, a lthough one investment-grade firm  postponed a deal scheduled 
to come to market on July 26, a day of partic ularly high volatility in financial markets.  
Commercial paper outstanding posted a modest gain in July.  C&I loan growth through 
mid-July picked up from an already solid  clip.  According to industry reports, 
underwriting banks have been forced to keep on their balance sheets loans that they were 
III-7 
unable to place with investors.  Overall, net debt financing stepped down in July from its 
torrid second-quarter pace but remained moderate.1 
 Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corp orations also fell off in July, in line 
with typical seasonal patterns.  Private equity issuance is estimated to have picked up in 
the second quarter on the strength of LBOs.  Ev en so, net equity issu ance continued to be 
deeply negative, as share repurchases and retirements from cash-financed mergers and 
acquisitions both held at near-record paces.  In July, tighter financial conditions for 
speculative-grade firms weighed on merger a nd acquisition activity, particularly LBOs, 
portending a slowdown in retirements, a nd to a lesser extent , private issuance. 
 
Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial mortgage debt is  estimated to have expanded briskly again in the second 
quarter, and the issuance calendar for comme rcial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
suggests solid growth early  in the third quarter. 
 Spreads of rates on investment-grade CMBS over those on comparab le-maturity Treasury 
securities have risen shar ply over the intermeeting peri od, and the spread on the BBB-
rated tranche now stands at its highest level since the fa ll of 1998.  CMBS spreads rose 
earlier this year as demand fell from the sponsors of collateralized debt obligations 
(CDOs).  Over the past couple of months, spreads have been volatile but trended up 
sharply as investors and rating agencies b ecame increasingly concerned about the higher 
leverage on recently securitized mortgages.  The most recent spike in late July may 
reflect increased anxiety about st ructured products in general. 
 The delinquency rate on CMBS ticked down in J une to the lowest level recorded for this 
series.  Delinquency rates on commercial mort gages held at life insurance companies 
remained negligible in the first quarter, whereas the delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held at commerci al banks rose a bit because  of deterioration in the 
performance of loans for multifamily properties and for construction and land development.  Although the vacancy rate on commercial properties edged up in the 
second quarter, it remained at a relatively low level, consistent with the moderate gains in 
rents.  Increases in commercial property prices  relative to operating income in the second 
quarter led to another decline in the ratio of net operating income to property prices, an 
indicator of the rate of  return on commercial real estate.  As a result, the spread of this

ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yi eld, a rough measure of the risk premium on 
commercial real estate assets, narrowed somewhat in the second quarter to its lowest level since 1991, reflecting continued st rong demand for commercial real estate 
properties.  
Household Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, interest rates on both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate 
mortgages for prime borrowers ticked down.  Mo rtgage debt growth is likely to have 
slowed further in the second quarter because of the decline in home -price growth over the 
past year.  Consumer credit expanded m oderately through the year ending in May. 
 Delinquency rates on consumer loans and pr ime mortgages—which account for the vast 
majority of total household debt—remained low through May.  Neve rtheless, according 
to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a number of banks tightened standards for 
prime mortgages over the past three months.  The delinquency rate on subprime variable-
rate mortgages topped 13 percent in J une, more than double the low in mid-2005.
2 
 Issuance of subprime-mortgage-backed securiti es (subprime MBS) has been negligible in 
July, as underwriters had difficulties placing th ese securities with investors.  Demand 
from CDOs was reported to be particularly weak, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty 
about the ratings that MBS-backed tranches of CDOs would receive.  Originations of 
subprime mortgages may have been held down by a further tightening of credit standards 
on nontraditional and subprime mortgage products, consistent with responses to the July 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Spread s on new issues of subprime MBS over libor 
climbed further over the intermeeting period after downgrades by Sta ndard & Poor’s and 
Moody’s of MBS backed by subprime mortgages originated in the first half of 2006.  
Standard & Poor’s also downgraded some CDOs backed by subprime MBS, including 
some AAA-rated tranches.  Seve re liquidity problems at a few large nonprime mortgage 
lenders contributed to the ge neral sense of investor angst about the mortgage market. 
 The OFHEO purchase-only index of  home prices rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in 
the first quarter, and the availabl e monthly indicators point to little change in that index in  
                                                
 
2 There was reportedly considerable attention paid to the announcement by a major mortgage lender 
that it had experienced a rise in delinquencies in the second quarter across all mortgage products, not just subprime loans, and that the housing market may not recover until 2009.  However, this report may not be 
indicative of broad housing market trends but instead may reflect the relatively severe deterioration in the 
housing market in California, where that  lender’s business is concentrated.

the second quarter.  Futures quotes on the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index continue 
to indicate that home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets are expected to 
decline modestly over the next few quarters.  Given the rise in stock prices in the second qua rter and our expectati on of essentially flat 
house prices, we estimate that household net worth relative to disposable income 
increased last quarter, reversi ng the decline posted in the firs t quarter.  Net flows to long-
term mutual funds were robust in June a nd July, propelled by strong inflows to both 
international equity and bond funds, while domes tic equity funds continued to have net 
outflows.

Treasury security auctions during the inte rmeeting period were well received, according 
to bid-to-cover ratios.  Demand from foreign investors appeared to stay strong:  The six-
month trailing averages of i ndirect bidding ratios remained robust, and foreign custody 
holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York edged a bit higher. 
 Despite the strains in credit markets, Treasury market liquidity remained ample.  Trading 
volume for on-the-run issues wa s near record highs.  Bid- ask spreads widened slightly, 
on balance, but were wi thin historical norms. 
 Yield spreads on debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over comparable Treasury 
securities moved to their widest levels in  a few years, reflecting investor concerns 
regarding their exposure to mortgage products .  These concerns also weighed on share 
prices of these government-sponsored enterp rises, which fell roughly 10 percent on net. 
 In its quarterly refunding statement, the Tr easury Department announced that it will offer 
$22 billion in new securities at the August re funding, including $13 billion in ten-year 
notes and $9 billion in thirty -year bonds.  The Treasury also  reported that it expects the 
current debt ceiling to be reached in early October.  
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-te rm municipal bonds fell sharply in July.  Short-term issuance is 
on track to match its average pace over the fi rst half of the year.  Rating changes were 
minimal in July, and the ratio of a represen tative municipal bond yi eld to a comparable-
maturity Treasury yield stayed near the low end of its range of the past decade, 
suggesting that the credit quality of municipal bonds remains solid.

Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at an annual rate  of about 4 percent in Jul y, down from its surprisingly 
strong pace earlier in the y ear.  Liquid deposits and small time deposits, the main 
contributors to the slowdown, have been about  flat in July, wher eas retail money funds 
surged nearly 23 percent.  Currency growth has been modest, held down by weak foreign 
demand.  Commercial bank credit is estimated to have grown at about a 9 per cent rate in July, a 
pace just below that of the second quarter.  Commercial and industrial loans continued to 
expand smartly.  By contrast, lending to bus inesses through commercia l real estate loans 
is estimated to have slowed notably in Jul y.  The weakness in residential real estate 
lending in June appears to have persisted la st month, as banks sold a large volume of 
mortgages.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the demand for 
both nontraditional and subprime mortgages weaken ed further over the past three months.  
Consumer loan originations rebounded in Ju ly, although this increase was mainly a result 
of a thrift-to-bank consolidation within a bank holding company; without this boost, 
consumer loans continued to advance at a moderate pace.

Appendix 
III-A-1 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
 
The July 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opin ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.1 Special questions in the survey asked banks about their involvement in, and 
assessment of, the outlook for the syndicated loan  market. As in the April survey, banks were 
queried separately about changes in standards on, and demand for, prime, nontraditional, and 
subprime residential mortgages.  This appendi x is based on responses from fifty-two domestic 
banks and twenty foreign banking institutions.  Both domestic and foreign institutions indicated  that they had eased terms on commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans over the past three months , while a small net fraction of banks reported a 
tightening of standards on such loans over the same  period.  Respondents also noted in the July 
survey that they had tightened credit standards on commercial real estate loans.  On net, domestic 
institutions reported somewhat weaker demand for C&I loans over the past three months.  
Branches and agencies of foreign institutions, in  contrast, reportedly experienced moderately 
stronger demand for such loans, on net, over th e same period.  Both domestic and foreign 
institutions noted that the demand for commercial real estate loans has we akened, on net, since 
April.  With regard to loans to households, domestic in stitutions reported that lending standards on prime 
residential mortgages had tightened some, on balance, during the survey period, whereas 
considerable net fractions of respondents indicat ed that they had further tightened lending 
standards on nontraditional and subprime mortgage loans.  Demand for prime and nontraditional 
residential mortgages was reportedly slightly weaker over the past three months, but a notable net fraction of banks reported that they had seen weaker demand for subprime residential mortgages 
over the same period.  A significant net percen tage of domestic banks also reported weaker 
demand for consumer loans over the past three months.  
Business Lending  
In the July survey, a small net fraction of domestic  institutions reported that they had tightened 
lending standards on C&I loans to large and middle- market firms over the past three months.  
Domestic respondents, however, noted that they  had further eased some terms on C&I loans to 
such firms over the same period.  About 30 percen t of respondents—a smaller net fraction than in 
the April survey—indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds 
over the previous three months, while smaller ne t fractions reported that they had reduced the 
costs of credit lines and eased loan covenants.  
                                                     
 
1 The survey was conducted between July 16 and July 26. As a result, banks’ responses are unlikely to 
reflect fully changes in their lending policies stemmi ng from the recent volatility in financial markets. 
III-A-2 
Similarly, a very small net fraction of domestic institutions also reported having tightened lending 
standards on C&I loans to small firms in the July  survey.  About one-third of domestic banks, on 
net, reported that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for such 
borrowers over the past three months, and smaller net fractions reported that they had reduced the 
costs of credit lines and lowered premiums charged on riskier loans.  Fifteen percent of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that they had tightened 
credit standards on C&I loans during the survey period.  Regarding loan terms, a small net 
fraction of foreign institutions indicated that th ey had increased the maximum size of credit lines, 
whereas other terms on C&I loans at these instituti ons were reportedly little changed over the past 
three months.  Nearly all domestic banks and all U.S. branch es and agencies of foreign banks that reported 
having eased their lending standards and terms in the July survey pointed to more-aggressive 
competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done 
so.  Institutions that reportedly moved to a more stringent lending posture, in contrast, cited a less 
favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a reduced tolerance for risk, and decreased 
liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans as the most important reasons for the change in 
their lending policies.  The net fraction of domestic banks reporting weak er demand for C&I loans in the survey period 
declined somewhat relative to th e April survey.  On net, about one-eighth of domestic banks 
noted that they had experienced weaker dema nd for C&I loans from large and middle-market, as 
well as from small firms in the July survey.  In contrast, one-fifth of U.S. branches and agencies 
of foreign banks, on net, reported stronger dema nd for C&I loans over the past three months.  The 
most frequently cited reasons for weaker dema nd at domestic banks were  borrowers’ decreased 
need to finance inventories and investment in plant and equipment.  A relatively large number of domestic and foreign institutions  that reported an increase in demand for C&I loans, pointed to 
greater financing needs for merger and acquis ition (M&A) activity as the most important reason 
for the rise.   Regarding future business, about 13 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported that the 
number of inquiries from potential business borrowe rs had decreased over the previous three 
months, about the same percentage as in the April survey.  On net, foreign respondents indicated 
that the number of inquiries from potential busin ess borrowers was unchanged over the past three 
months.

III-A-4 
The July survey included a set of special questions regarding banks’ involvement in, and 
assessment of the outlook for, the syndicated loan market.2  In general, syndicated loans 
accounted for a relatively small fraction of C&I loans on domestic banks’ books, but the share 
was substantial for some banks.  About one-fourth of domestic in stitutions noted that syndicated 
loans accounted for less than 5 percent of their bank’s C&I loans, and about one-half reported 
that syndicated loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent of their C&I loan 
portfolios.3  About one-fifth of respondents noted that syndicated loans accounted for between  
21 percent and 50 percent of their C&I loans.  Four domestic respondents noted that these loans 
accounted for more than 50 percent—but less th an 75 percent—of  C&I loans on their books. 
These institutions accounted for about 10 percent of all C&I loans on the books of the domestic 
banks that responded to this special question.  In  general, the share of syndicated loans did not 
appear to be related to the size of banks’ portf olios of C&I loans.  At foreign institutions, 
syndicated loans accounted for a more significant fraction of C&I loans on respondents’ books:  Of the twenty respondents, four foreign institu tions reported that syndicated loans accounted for 
between 35 percent and 50 percent of their C&I lo an portfolios, whereas six institutions reported 
that such loans accounted for between 50 percent and 75 percent of C&I loans.  Finally, nine 
foreign banks reported that syndicated loans accounted for more than 75 percent of C&I loans on their books.  One relatively small foreign res pondent noted that syndicated loans accounted for 
between 5 percent and 20 percent of its C&I loans.   As was the case for domestic institutions, the 
share of syndicated loans did not appear to be  related to the size of the foreign banks’ loan 
portfolios.  According to the July survey, leveraged syndicat ed loans generally accounted for a relatively 
modest fraction of all syndicated loans on the bo oks of most domestic and foreign institutions.
4  
About one-half of domestic banks reported that  leveraged syndicated credits accounted for less 
than 5 percent of syndicated loans on their boo ks, whereas approximately 40 percent noted that 
such loans accounted for between 5 percent and 35 percent of their syndicated loans.  About one-
tenth of domestic respondents reported that leve raged loans accounted for more than 35 percent—
but less than 75 percent—of their syndicated loans.  Regarding foreign banks, about one-third of 
                                                      
2 A few large banks with prominent position in the syndicated loan market have not yet provided 
responses to these special questions. We expect to have their responses in time for the public release of the 
survey results.  The number  of domestic banks that responded to these special questions varied from forty-
four to forty-nine depending on the question. According to Call Repor ts, these respondents accounted for 
between 43 percent and 53 percent of all C&I loans on  the books of domestic comm ercial banks as of March 
31, 2007. The number of foreign institutions that responded to these special questions varied from eighteen to twenty depending on the question.  As of March 31, 2007, the foreign respondents accounted for about  55percent of all C&I loans on the books of U.S.  branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
3 Three relatively small banks reported that  they do not hold any syndicated loans. 
4 In the survey, a loan was defined as leveraged if  the obligor's postfinancing leverage—as measured 
by ratios of debt to assets, debt to equity, or cash flow to total debt or by other such standards unique to 
particular industries—significantly exceeded industry norms for leverage. 
III-A-5 
these institutions reported that leveraged loans acc ounted for more than 20 percent—but less than 
50 percent—of the syndicated loans on their books .  About the same fractions of foreign banks 
noted that leveraged loans accounted for between  5 percent and 20 percent and for less than  
5 percent of syndicated loans on their books.  Domestic institutions reported that loans orig inated to fund leveraged buyout (LBO) activity 
typically accounted for a relatively small fraction of syndicated loans on their books.  About two-thirds of domestic respondents noted that LBO -related loans accounted for less than 5 percent of 
syndicated loans on their books, whereas about 30 percent reported that such loans accounted for 
between 5 percent and 35 percent of their syndi cated loans.  Finally, about 6 percent of 
respondents noted that LBO-related loans account ed for more than 35 percent—but less than 
75 percent—of syndicated loans on their books.  Foreign institutions also mostly reported 
relatively small exposure to LBO-related loans.  About 65 percent of foreign respondents reported 
that LBO-related loans accounted for less than 5 pe rcent of their syndicated loans, and about one-
fifth of respondents noted that such loans accounted  for between 5 percent and 35 percent of their 
syndicated loans. Only three foreign institutions  reported that LBO-related loans accounted for 
more than 35 percent—but less than 75 percen t—of their syndicated loan portfolios. 
 At both domestic and foreign institutions, bri dge loans and equity bridge loans generally 
accounted for very small fractions of syndicated loans.
5 About one-half of domestic institutions 
reported that they did not have any bridge loan s on their books, and about 45 percent of domestic 
banks noted that such loans accounted for between  0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated 
loans.  Only one institution reported that br idge loans accounted for between 5 percent and  
20 percent of its syndicated loan portfolio.  Regarding equity bridge loans, three-fourths of domestic respondents reported that they did not have any such loans on their books, and the remaining fraction noted that equity bridge lo ans accounted for between 0 percent and 5 percent 
of their syndicated loans.  Of the nineteen forei gn respondents, five banks indicated that they did 
not have any bridge loans on their books, wherea s twelve banks noted that bridge loans accounted 
for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their sy ndicated loans. Only two foreign institutions 
reported that bridge loans accounted for between  5 percent and 20 percent of their syndicated 
loans.  Regarding equity bridge loans, two-thirds  of foreign institutions reported that they did not 
have any such loans on their books, whereas the remaining banks noted that such loans accounted 
for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated loans.  Domestic and foreign banks reportedly expect a tightening of credit standards and terms in the 
syndicated loan market in coming months, in part  because of a very large number of deals in the  
                                                     
 
5 In the survey, bridge loans were defined as M&A-related loans that banks expected to be paid down 
with funds raised in capital markets within the next twelve months. Equity bridge loans were defined as 
loans that are originated to LBO sponsors to provide financing applied toward the sponsors’ equity 
contributions in buyouts and that are subsequently paid down with funds raised in equity sales.

pipeline.  Indeed, about two-thirds of domest ic respondents and almost all foreign respondents 
expect tighter lending standards, a widening of lo an spreads, an increased number of covenants, 
and more-stringent covenants.  Moreover, more than one-third  of domestic respondents and 
approximately two-thirds of foreign respondents expect a reduction in the loan portion of 
financing deals and the introduction of call protection or original issue discounts on loan deals.  Lending standards for commercial real estate lo ans were reportedly tightened further over the 
survey period:  About one-fourth of domestic ins titutions—a slightly smalle r net fraction than in 
the previous survey—and about one-third of foreig n institutions indicated that they had tightened 
lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  Regarding demand, 
approximately one-fourth of domestic and fore ign institutions reported that demand for 
commercial real estate loans had weakened over the past three months.  
Household Lending 
As in the April survey, banks were asked to re port separately about changes in standards on, and 
demand for, prime, nontraditional, and subprime resi dential mortgages.  In the July survey, banks 
indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on the three mortgage loan categories 
over the past three months, although the net frac tions of banks that reported doing so were 
somewhat smaller than in the April survey.  About 13 percent of domestic banks reportedly 
tightened their lending standards on prime residential mortgages over the past three months.
6  By 
contrast, about 38 percent of respondents—out of the forty institutions that originated 
nontraditional residential mortgages—noted that they had tightened standards on these types of 
mortgage products.7  Moreover, of the fifteen institutions that reported having originated 
subprime residential mortgages, about 53 percen t reported that they had tightened standards on 
such loans.8 
 As in the April survey, tighter standards on subp rime and nontraditional mortgage loans were not 
necessarily associated with more-stringent lending policies on prime loans.  Indeed, of the eight 
institutions that reported having tightened standa rds on subprime residential mortgages over the 
past three months, only one bank had tightened standards on prime residential mortgages.  Of the fifteen domestic banks that tightened standards on nontraditional mortgage loans, five tightened 
standards on prime mortgages.   
                                                     
 
6 Forty-seven institutions reported that they had or iginated prime residential mortgages. These forty-
seven banks accounted for about 60 percent of residentia l real estate loans on th e books of a ll commercial 
banks as of March 31, 2007. 
7 These forty institutions accounted for about 51 percen t of residential real estate loans on the books of 
all commercial banks as of March 31, 2007. 
8 These fifteen institutions accounted for about 47 per cent of residential real estate loans on the books 
of all commercial banks as of March 31, 2007. 
III-A-10 
On net, about one-tenth of dom estic banks—a smaller net fraction than in the April survey—
reported weaker demand for prime mortgage loans,  and about one-fifth of respondents—about the 
same net fraction as in the April survey—e xperienced weaker demand for nontraditional 
mortgage loans.  In contrast, about 46 percent of respondents, on net—more than twice the percentage in the April survey—reported weaker  demand for subprime residential mortgages over 
the past three months.   On balance, domestic respondents’ willingness to  make consumer installment loans and their 
lending standards for approving applications on cr edit card loans were little changed over the past 
three months.  A small net fraction of banks re ported having tightened lending standards on non-
credit-card consumer loans over the same period.   Some terms on both categories of consumer 
loans were tightened a touch during the survey pe riod.  On net, about one-eighth of respondents 
reported having raised spreads of interest rates charged on outstanding credit card balances 
relative to their cost of funds, and about one -fifth of respondents reported having reduced the 
extent to which consumer loans other than cred it card loans were granted to customers who did 
not meet credit-scoring thresholds.  The remaining terms on both types of consumer loans were reportedly little changed.  Finally, on net, a bout one-fifth of domestic respondents reported that 
they had experienced weaker demand for consumer  loans, about the same net fraction as in the 
April survey.

In May, the value of exports of goods and serv ices increased 2.2 per cent, following little 
change in April.  The May increase mostly reflected a 3.3 percent jump in exports of 
nonagricultural goods (excluding go ld), although exports of serv ices also rose.  Within 
goods, exports of capital goods moved up briskl y, rising 5.5 percent; the increase was led 
by a particularly large jump in exports of  aircraft but was also supported by higher 
exports of computers and semiconductors.  E xports of industrial s upplies exhibited strong 
growth, boosted by a jump in exports of pe troleum products.  After a sharp 10.6 percent 
increase in April, agricultural exports edge d down in May.  For the second consecutive 
month, automotive exports declined modestly.   
 The average value of exports in April and Ma y increased 9.6 pe rcent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter.  Exports of agricu ltural goods and industrial s upplies exhibited particular 
strength.  In contrast, exports of capital goods  edged down, reflecting declines in exports 
of aircraft and computers.  In the advan ce NIPA release, real exports of goods and 
services rose at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the second quarter.

The value of imported goods and services rose  2.3 percent in May following a 2 percent 
decline in April.  About half of the May increase was due to non- oil goods, but oil and 
services imports were also higher.  The rise in imports of non-oil goods was led by 
imports of non-oil industrial supplies a nd capital goods, which increased 3.9 and 
2.9 percent, respectively.   After a decline of 4.7 percent in  April, imports of automotive 
products fell a further 2.4 percent in May.  The average value of imports in April and May rose 7.4 percent (a.r.) from the first quarter.  The increase partly reflected a large ri se in the value of imported oil, as a jump 
in the price of imported oil more than offs et a decline in quantity.  Imports of non-oil 
industrial supplies also rose sh arply.  Imports of services in creased only slightly, whereas 
imports of autos, consumer goods, and capital goods all declined.  In the advance NIPA 
release, real imports of goods and services  fell 2.6 percent in the second quarter. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In June, prices of U.S. imports of core goods rose 0.2 percent, below 
the 0.5 percent increase in May.  Prices for imported material-intensive goods rose 
0.5 percent, more slowly than in recent mont hs, but they still accounted for the bulk of 
the increase in core prices.  Within material -intensive goods, non-fuel industrial supplies 
led the way, as prices for imported metals jump ed in June.  Prices for imported finished 
goods inched up in June, as the boost from a sizable jump in prices for capital goods 
(excluding computers and semiconductors) was o ffset by flat prices for consumer goods 
and a sluggish increase in prices for automob iles.  Outside of core imports, the price for 
imported natural gas rose 0.5 percent, pr ices for imported semiconductors were 
unchanged, and prices for imported computers fell.  In the second quarter, core import prices rose  about 3½ percent at an annual rate (on a 
NIPA basis), continuing the acc eleration from the first quart er.  Prices for material-
intensive goods were up 12 percent (a.r.), wh ereas prices for finished goods increased 
1¼ percent (a.r.).  Within mate rial-intensive goods, prices for agricultural products and 
metals both rose sharply, while most of the price increase for imported finished goods 
reflects higher prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors). 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 4.7 percent in June.  The index has risen 
for five consecutive months and stands 28 per cent above its level in January.  The spot 
price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) cr ude oil increased roughly 6 percent in June 
and nearly 8 percent in July.  In July, the spot price averaged around $74 per barrel.

The rise in oil prices over the past two mont hs appears to reflect recent supply disruptions 
and concerns of a tighter oil market goi ng forward.  Planned a nd unplanned production 
outages in the North Sea, worsening violence  in Nigeria, and con tinued OPEC production 
restraint have provided upward support for oil prices.  In addition, global oil demand has 
remained robust.  Moreover, the idiosyncrati c weakness that has recently characterized 
the spot price of WTI relative to the prices of other grades of oil has begun to dissipate as 
inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, have run off from record 
levels.  
 
Exports.   Prices of U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.4 percent in June, somewhat faster 
than in May.  All of the in crease came from material-inten sive goods; prices of exported 
finished goods were flat in June.  Within material-intensive goods, prices of exported 
agricultural products rose almo st 3 percent in June, after falling in April and being 
roughly flat in May, with prices  for imported grains and meat both soaring in the month.  
Prices of exported computers fell 0.3 percent in June, a modest decline compared to the 
average decline over the past  year, and prices for exported semiconductors were 
unchanged for the second consecutive month.  In the second quarter, core export prices ro se 7 percent at an a nnual rate (on a NIPA 
basis), about 1 percentage point fa ster than in the first quarter.  The step up in inflation is 
attributable to prices for nonagricultura l industrial supplies.  There was a sharp 
deceleration in prices for agricultural exports, which rose at an annual rate of 7½ percent 
after rising at an average rate of over 20 percent in the three previous quarters. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
Total net foreign private purchases of U.S. l ong-term securities (line 4 of the Summary of 
U.S. International Transactions table) tota led $125 billion in May, the first month during 
which total foreign private net purchases ha ve exceeded $100 billion, but moderated in 
June to $62 billion.  May's inflows were led by record foreign net pur chases of both U.S. 
corporate debt (line 4c) and U.S. equities (line 4d).  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. corporate debt dropped to an unusually low $16 billion in June.  Foreign acquisitions of 
U.S. equities also fell in June, but remained  strong at $27 billion.  Private net purchases 
of Treasures (line 4a) were re latively robust in both May and June following large net 
sales in April.  There were small net purchase s of agency debt secu rities in both May and 
June.   
 
IV-8 
For the second quarter as a whole, total priv ate inflows were exceptionally large at $222 
billion (line 4), result ing primarily from record inflows in to U.S. equities ($105 billion).  
Foreign investors purchased more U.S. equiti es in the second quarter of 2007 than they 
did in all of 2005 and are on pace to double th eir acquisitions of 2006.  Foreign purchases 
of U.S. corporate debt ($100 billion) accounted for the bulk of the remaining inflows into 
U.S. securities during the quarter and were in line with inflows seen in recent quarters.  
There were modest net purchases of agency  debt securities and small net sales of 
Treasuries during the quarter. 
 Foreign official flows in May and June (lin e 1) followed a markedly different pattern 
from private flows, with very small inflows recorded in May ($8 billion) and very large 
inflows recorded in June ($58 billion).  
 
  
 
 
 
.  For the quarter, total official inflows were measured at $100 
billion, a bit lower than the average of recen t quarters.  
 
.  
 U.S. residents' acquisitions of foreign securiti es (line 5) in May and June were in keeping 
with recent trends and were evenly distri buted between equity and debt securities.  
Outflows during the second quarter ($88 billion)  were about the same as those recorded 
in the first quarter and a bit ahead of last year's pace.  Most of these acquisitions were recorded versus the United Kingdom, which yiel ds little conclusive information as to the 
ultimate destination of these flows as many non- U.K. securities trade on U.K. exchanges. 
 The normally volatile banking sector (line 3) posted a small net inflow during the quarter despite a large net outflow in June.    Combining official flows with private banki ng and private security flows yields a net 
inflow in the second quarter of $241 billion, roughly $40 billion above the first quarter's 
figure for this measure.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
Volatility in financial markets increased over the intermeeting period, with sovereign 
yields falling 10 to 33 basis points and stock markets declining 2.7 to  4.7 percent in major 
economies.  Although these moves were pr ompted by rising concerns about the 
subprime-mortgage market in the United States , investors appeared to re-evaluate risk 
spreads more generally in both U.S. and fore ign financial markets and to increase their 
demands for safer assets.  The major currenc ies index of the dollar’s exchange value 
declined 1.4 percent on balance over the pe riod.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar 
depreciated over 3 percent against the yen, 1.4 percent vis-à-vis the euro and sterling, and 
it was little changed against the Canadian dol lar.  In late July, the dollar depreciated 
against the euro to an all-time low.  
Headline equity indexes declin ed about 4 percent in the United Kingdom and in the euro 
area, and 4.7 percent in Japan.  Following elevat ed concerns in credit markets, realized 
volatilities on headline equity indexes picked up in the euro area, Japan, and in the United 
States over the period.  The intermeeting period saw widespread tighten ing in monetary policy and increases in 
short-term interest rates.  On June 28, Norw ay’s central bank rais ed its benchmark rate 
25 basis points, to 4.5 percent; on July 5, the Bank of England increased its Bank rate 
25 basis points, to 5.75 percent; on July 10, the Bank of Canada raised its target for the 
overnight rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percen t; and on July 12, the Bank of Japan voted 8-1 
to keep its target rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent.  All moves were fully anticipated.  The 
European Central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at the July and August meetings, 
also in line with market expectations, a nd the Bank of England kept the Bank rate 
unchanged on August 2.  Three-month spot intere st rates increased 3 to 13 basis points in 
Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Cana da.  In contrast, ten-year nominal 
sovereign yields decreased between 10 and 22 basis points in the same countries. U.S. 
ten-year rates fell 33 basis points.  Yields on inflation-indexed sovereign bonds decreased 
almost as much as nominal yields did duri ng the intermeeting period, except in the Japan, 
where inflation breakeven rates rose slightly.  Realized volatilities of ten-year bonds 
increased in the intermeeting period in  the United States, Germany, and Japan. 
 The dollar’s trade-weighted exchange value ag ainst the currencies of our other important 
trading partners changed little on balan ce over the intermeeting period.  The dollar 
depreciated 6.5 percent agai nst the Thai baht, despite Thailand’s central bank’s 
IV-13 
announcement on July 12 that it would scra p limits on direct offshore investment by 
listed Thai companies in an effort to stem  currency appreciation.  The Bank of Thailand 
surprised markets by cutting its benchmark 1-day repurchase rate 25 basis points, to 
3.25 percent, on July 18.  The dollar also de preciated 2.9 percent vis-à-vis the Brazilian 
real.  Brazil’s central bank cut its Selic lendi ng rate 50 basis points to a record low of 
11.5 percent on July 19.  In contrast, the dol lar appreciated 1.3 pe rcent vis-à-vis the 
Mexican peso.  The Mexican Bolsa index d ecreased 2.5 percent on balance, whereas the 
Brazilian Bovespa index increased 1.1 percen t.  In emerging Asia, Thailand and Korea’s 
main equity indexes rose over 5 percent on balance.  Emerging market bond spreads 
increased considerably in Latin America over the period.  
 
On July 20, the People’s Bank of China (P BoC) increased its benchmark one-year 
lending and deposit rate floors, effective July 21, following news that both GDP and 
consumer prices increased st rongly in the second quarter.  The renminbi appreciated on 
net 0.7 percent versus the dollar over th e intermeeting period and the Shanghai 
Composite index increased 12.6 percent.  
 
.  The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Upbeat business and consumer confidence, as  well as favorable la bor market conditions, 
suggests that growth has remained above tre nd in all the advanced foreign economies in 
the current quarter, despite some slowing of  expansion in the se cond quarter.  Although 
many of these economies experienced sharp decl ines in equity pri ces and widening credit 
spreads amid deepening concerns about cred it quality, these developments occurred too 
late in the intermeeting period to have  any apparent impact on incoming data. 
 Headline inflation has leveled off in both th e United Kingdom and Canada, but elevated 
core inflation readings reveal that inflationary pressures are still strong.  In the euro area, 
inflation continues to hover cl ose to, but below, 2 percent.  In Japan, headline inflation 
dipped back into negative territory in J une.  The Bank of England and the Bank of 
Canada both raised their policy interest rates in early July. 
 In Japan, the June Tankan survey continued to portray an economy that is expanding 
moderately, with the headline index of ec onomic sentiment among large manufacturers 
remaining high by historical standards.  Th e survey also pointed to strong capital 
spending plans by large- and medium-sized firms and indicated an across-the-board 
improvement in the sales outlook.  Overall, fi rms continued to see the labor market and 
resource utilization as relatively tight. 
 Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that the economy is facing some headwinds.  Second-quarter consumption indicators are some what mixed, with retail sales advancing 
in May and real household expe nditures receding a bit in bot h May and June.  Industrial 
production rebounded 1.2 percent in June after de clining for three consecutive months.  
Shipments continued to rise in June, leadi ng to a reduction in the inventories-to-sales 
ratio.  The inventories-to-sales ratio for in formation and communications equipment also 
fell in May and June, after having risen substant ially in previous months.  In June, real 
exports rose 0.7 percent, while  real imports were about unchanged.  On a twelve-month 
basis, real exports to the United States decl ined for a fourth consecutive month in June, 
while real exports to the European Un ion and Asia continued to increase. 
 Consumer prices edged lower in June, and the twelve-month rate of headline inflation 
turned negative again.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation rema ined slightly below 
zero in June, and the fall in Tokyo core cons umer prices in July indicated little 
inflationary pressure in the near term.  Nominal wages continued to decline in May, 
IV-20 
despite the unemployment rate remaining at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in nearly ten 
years.  In Upper House elections held July 29, Japa n’s ruling Liberal Democr atic Party lost its 
majority.  Prime Minister Abe vowed to cont inue pursuing reform despite calls for his 
resignation, but he said he would reshuffle his cabinet in an effo rt to win back voter trust.  
The ruling coalition still has a large majority in the more  powerful Lower House of 
Parliament, but loss of control of the uppe r chamber may threaten policy gridlock.

Euro-area  GDP growth in the first quarter was revised upward 0.5 percentage point to 
2.9 percent.  The pace of economic expansion ap pears to have slowed a bit in the second 
quarter in spite of a rebound in consumption spending in Germany from the first-quarter 
plunge that was induced by a hike in the valu e-added tax.  Other data released during the 
intermeeting period came in a bit weaker than  had been expected.  Euro-area industrial 
production rose in May, but the average figur e for April and May was just 0.2 percent 
above the first-quarter average.  Euro-area retail sales also disappointed, with a decline of 
0.7 percent in May, reportedly because of unusually gloomy weather conditions.  In June, in contrast, French consumer spending on manufactured goods bounced back after two 
weak months, rising 1.6 percent.  Indicators of third-quarter activity point to relatively strong growth.  The euro-area 
purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing a nd especially for services remained well 
above the expansion threshol d in July.  European Commission survey measures of 
business and consumer confidence remained near  record levels in July.  In Germany, the 
IFO indicator of business morale edged down for a second straight month in July but 
remained at a fairly elevated level, even  though manufacturers were  less optimistic about 
exports.  Labor market conditions have continued to improve.  The euro-area unemployment rate 
declined further in May to 6.9 percent, and re mained there in June, the lowest rate since 
Eurostat began measuring it in 1993 and almost 2 percentage points be low its rate at the 
beginning of 2005.  Wage pressures have noneth eless remained moderate.  In the first 
quarter, total labor costs and unit labor co sts rose only 2.2 per cent and 0.8 percent, 
respectively, above their levels a year earlier.  Euro-area consumer prices rose 1.8 percent in  July on a twelve-month basis, according to 
the preliminary estimate.  Core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) stood 
at 1.9 percent in June.  Liquidity growth in  the euro area has remained surprisingly high, 
renewing concern about price stab ility among several ECB officials.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom  rose 3.3 percent (a.r.) in the second quarte r, according 
to the preliminary estimate.  Growth was driven mainly by services, which expanded 
3.6 percent.  After four quarters of st agnation, the output of  production industries 
expanded 2.0 percent, led by a 2.7 pe rcent expansion of manufacturing. 
 Although GDP expenditure components are not  yet available, other indicators are 
consistent with a firming of domestic demand in the second quarter.  Retail sales grew a 
robust 4.7 percent (a.r.) in the three-month pe riod to June, up 2.6 percentage points from 
a quarter earlier.  According to the Ba nk of England Agents’ Summary of Business 
Conditions, a survey of U.K. private businesses,  investment intentions  in the services and 
manufacturing sectors were both near decade highs in June.  The Labor Force Survey and the claimant count measures of the unemployment rate both ticked down during the intermeeting period, r eaching 5.4 percent in April and 2.7 percent 
in June, respectively.  Wage inflation remain s contained.  The twelve-month growth rate 
of average earnings (including bonuses) was 3.5 percent in May, almost 0.5 percentage 
points lower than its average over the previous five years.  Unit wage costs in manufacturing industries were 1.3 percent higher in May than they were a year earlier. 
 The twelve-month rate of headline inflati on continued to revert back towards the 
2 percent target during the in termeeting period, sliding to 2.4 percent in June.  For a 
fourth consecutive month, housing and household services were the main drivers of the 
fall in inflation, as natural gas and electricity prices declined so far this year after having 
risen last year.  Core inflation, whic h excludes energy and unprocessed food, was 
unchanged at 2.2 percent in June, remaining near  record highs since the series began in 
1997.  The Bank of England raised its key policy inte rest rate ¼ percentage point to 5.75 percent 
on July 5, judging that the balanc e of risks to the outlook for in flation continued to lie to 
the upside.

In Canada,  real GDP by industry rose 4.2 percent (a.r.) in May,  propelled by significant 
increases in retail and wholesale trade.  Th e advance in retail trade between April and 
May, which was widespread across sectors, was the best one-month showing since late 
2001.  Construction activity also increase d, as strong growth in non-residential 
construction more than offset a small declin e in residential cons truction.  Manufacturing 
output rose; however, industrial pr oduction slipped a bit, due to  a retreat of energy sector 
output, especially in oil a nd gas exploration activities. 
 Other indicators for the second quarter continue to suggest growth at a rate slightly above 
that of potential.  Averag ed over April and May, the volume of exports was over one 
percent higher than the firs t-quarter average, while the volume of imports was about 
0.6 percent higher.  Despite appreciation of  the Canadian dollar, the manufacturing 
sector, which is heavily export-oriented, ha s fared particularly well:  the volume of 
manufacturing shipments increased for a four th consecutive month in May, and both new 
and unfilled orders also rose strongly.  S econd-quarter housing starts were 2 percent 
above their first-quarter level.  The composite  index of leading indicators and the Ivey 
purchasing managers’ index both rose again in June. 
 Employment growth picked up in June after being about flat on net in the previous two 
months; the April and May lull came on the heel s of first-quarter job gains that were the 
strongest in five years.  The unemployment ra te again held steady at 6.1 percent in June, 
a thirty-three year low, and twelve-month wa ge inflation increased  to 3.2 percent from 
2.8 percent in May.  In June, the twelve-month rate of co nsumer price inflation was 2.2 percent,  the fifth 
consecutive month it has been above the mid-poi nt of the Bank of Canada’s target range 
of 1 to 3 percent.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight most 
volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, moved up to 2.5 percent 
in June from 2.2 percent in May.  Continuing to exert upward pressure on the core index 
is homeowners’ replacement costs (which ar e estimated using, among other data, prices 
for new homes); replacement costs have decele rated since last summer, but they continue 
to grow at over 6 percent.  The twelve-month rate of change of new home prices inched 
down to 8.6 percent in May, continuing its gradual moderation since last summer. 
 The Bank of Canada increased the target for the overnight rate ¼ percentage point to 
4.5 percent on July 10, its first move si nce May 2006, citing str onger-than-expected 
economic growth and inflation in the first half of this year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent economic indicators from the developing economies suggest that economic activity remains generally strong.  The Chin ese economy has continued to expand at a 
blistering pace, and activity elsewhere in emer ging Asia appears to have accelerated.  In 
Latin America, Mexican indicators point to a weaker-than-exp ected rebound in the 
second quarter, whereas Brazil and Argentina ap pear to have experienced solid growth.  
Inflation has increased in China, mainly due  to soaring food prices, but has generally 
remained little changed elsewhere in the deve loping world.  Equity prices have fallen and 
bond spreads have widened in several emerging market economies, particularly in Latin 
America; however, there is no evidence so fa r that this increased volatility has weighed 
on economic activity.  In China , second-quarter real GDP grew at an es timated 14¾ percent an nual rate, driven 
by strength of exports and fixe d investment.  The rise in out put from its year-earlier level 
was the fastest recorded rate in nearly twelve  years.  Exports have been spurred by both 
high global demand and a rush to ship goods before the imposition of a fresh round of 
cuts in value-added tax rebates, effective July 1, on a wide array of exported products.  
Ballooning exports have resulted  in another large increase in  the trade surplus.  Fixed 
investment continued to e xpand rapidly, up 28 percent in the second quarter from its 
year-earlier level, and retail sa les grew at an impressive pa ce of more than 15 percent.  
 Consumer prices accelerated further in June, with a twelve-month increase of 4¼ percent, 
up from 3½ percent in May.  Food prices cont inued to soar, rising more than 11 percent 
in the twelve months ending in June.  Non-f ood price inflation hovered at just 1 percent, 
but concerns about food pri ce inflation spilling into non- food price inflation have 
intensified.  Part of the acceler ation in food prices is due to rising meat prices resulting 
from hog disease earlier this year.  Moreover, th e rate of inflation of  grain prices has not 
fallen.  Chinese authorities tightened monetary  policy again in mid-Ju ly after the release 
of the second quarter’s much-higher-than-expect ed growth and inflation figures.  Interest 
rates on the benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates were increased by 27 basis 
points each, to 3.33 and 6.84 percent respectively, the third increas e in rates this year.  In 
late July, the reserve requirement ratio fo r banks was raised by ½ percentage point, 
effective August 15.  Reserve requirements have  been raised a cumulative 4.5 percentage 
points since June 2006, bringing the total ratio to 12 percent for large banks.

In Hong Kong , recent data point to a pickup in th e pace of real GDP growth in the 
second quarter, following below-trend growth in  the first.  Retail sales rebounded in May 
from a weak April level.  In addition, the value of exports and imports in the second 
quarter grew 11 and 12 percent from a year ea rlier, respectively, an indicator of strong 
activity in this entrepôt economy.  The unemplo yment rate fell to its lowest level since 
1998.  Twelve-month inflation remained low in May and June because of a rent 
concession on public housing, schedu led to expire in October.

In Taiwan , economic indicators suggest that out put growth increased in the second 
quarter from a first-quarter trough.  After c ontracting in the firs t quarter, industrial 
production jumped nearly 8 percent in the s econd.  In addition, trade data for June 
showed strong growth in both exports and im ports, with the mercha ndise trade surplus 
IV-31 
increasing.  In June, twelve-month consumer pr ice inflation remained near zero; however, 
consumer prices climbed in the first half of th is year following a fall in the second half of 
2006.  The central bank in June increased its o fficial discount rate to 3.125 percent, the 
highest level since September 2001, mainly to di scourage the carry trade that has targeted 
Taiwan because of its low interest rates.

Korean  GDP jumped 7 percent in the second qu arter, a notable acceleration from the 
previous two quarters.  Do mestic demand remained strong, and net exports rebounded 
some.  On the back of the solid trade perf ormance, Korea’s current account returned to 
surplus in the second quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation in Korea rose 
2.5 percent in July.  Korean inflation conti nues to be boosted by food prices and a shift 
up in core inflation from last year.  Bank cr edit has risen sharply with lending to small- 
and medium-sized establishments up over 20 percent in the twelve months ending in 
June.  In response, the Bank of Korea raised  its target rate ¼ percentage point to 
4.75 percent in mid-July and also announced  restrictions on overseas borrowing by 
foreign and domestic banks.  Short-term external  debt has soared of late, in part reflecting 
currency hedging by Korean shipbuilders.  Finall y, the Bank also stated  that it would be 
shifting its target rate from the call rate to a 7-day repo rate early next year, but provided 
few details.

In India , economic indicators hint at some moderation in output growth after a 
first-quarter surge.  Average industrial production for April and May was up 3.6 percent 
from the previous quarter.  Inflation conti nued to decline, foll owing monetary policy 
tightening earlier in the year and other government measures targeted at reducing 
consumer prices for imported goods, and loan gr owth slowed.  After soaring in April, the 
trade deficit narrowed a bit in May, as e xport growth remained strong but imports 
weakened a touch.  The Reserve Bank of Indi a held rates steady at its meeting on July 31 
but raised the required cash reserve ratio fo r banks and removed th e ceiling imposed on 
IV-34 
the size of its daily reverse re po auctions.  Both moves were  thought to be targeted at 
removing liquidity from the banking syst em related to strong capital inflows.

Recent data for the ASEAN  region suggest continued expans ion in the second quarter.  In 
Singapore, the advance unofficial  estimate (not shown) indica tes that second-quarter real 
GDP rose nearly 13 percent, as the volat ile biomedical sector rebounded and domestic 
activity, notably construction, co ntinued to be strong.  Elsewhere in the region, average 
industrial production for April and May was up from first-quarter levels, and trade 
surpluses remained high.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation acro ss the region continued to decline in most 
countries owing to more subdued energy pri ce inflation and, in some countries, the 
unwinding of previous increases  in food prices and local currency appreciation.  One 
exception was Singapore, where higher health care and recreation prices boosted headline 
inflation.  Amid the reduced inflationary pr essures and the desire to stimulate domestic 
demand, the central banks of Indonesia and Thailand lowered interest rates 25 basis 
points in July.  The Philippine central bank also  lowered its policy rate 150 basis points in 
mid-July, but the bank simultaneously removed a tiered scheme that offered a lower interest rate on large deposits .  The rapid appreciation of its currency against the U.S. 
dollar prompted Thailand to relax its foreign exchange regulations in order to facilitate 
capital outflows.  Similarly, the Philippine  central bank announced that it would ease 
foreign exchange regulations  by the end of September.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to a weak er-than-expected rebound in economic 
activity in the second quarter.  The average level of industrial production in April and 
May was up only 1 percent from the first quarter, as the key manufacturing and 
construction sectors failed to experience any si gnificant recovery from their first-quarter 
weakness.  Twelve-month headline inflation remained at 4 percent in June, largely due to increases 
in milk, avocado, and orange prices.  Desp ite inflation hovering ar ound the upper limit of 
the Bank of Mexico's 2-to-4 percent inflati on target range, the central bank decided 
during its late July meeting not to tigh ten monetary policy but signaled a further 
tightening of policy might occur if in flation does not rece de as expected.

In Brazil , recent data releases indicate robust activity in the second quarter.  Average 
April-May industrial production was up 1.7 perc ent from the first quarter and 4½ percent 
from a year earlier, while retail sales were up over 9 percent from a year earlier.  The 
trade surplus widened to $49 billion in the second qua rter (a.r.), boosted by high 
commodities prices, bringing the current account surplus to over $10 billion, about 
1 percent of GDP.  The trade su rplus narrowed again in July, largely due to an increase in 
imports.

Twelve-month inflation moved up to 3.8 percent in June, fueled in part by higher prices 
of food, but is well below the 4.5 percent mid-po int of the government’s inflation target 
range.  On July 18, the central bank reduced its ta rget for the Selic rate 50 basis points, to 
11.5 percent.  The central bank continued to intervene to mitigate upward pressures on 
the real, raising international reserves to a record $155 billion.  The capital account 
surplus in the first half of the year reached nearly $60 billion, ten times the pace over the 
same period of 2006, reflecting a rise in both foreign direct investment and net portfolio 
capital inflows.

In Venezuela , inflation remained very high, endi ng at over 17 percent in July on a 
twelve-month basis.  The government conti nued to focus most of its attention on 
suppressing inflationary pressu res, in part by reducing the VAT from 11 to 9 percent in 
July.  The government is also reputed to have lowered spending growth in recent months, but fiscal accounts lack transparency.  
In recent weeks, the Finance Minister stat ed that the official bolívar would not be 
devalued in January 2008, when a so-called monetary reform is enacted, but may be 
devalued in early 2009.  (In January 2008, the bo lívar is scheduled to be replaced by the 
bolívar fuerte, which will be equal to 1,000 bolív ares.)   The parallel market bolívar has 
depreciated 25 percent against the dollar over the past nine months, fueling inflationary 
pressures, and prompting congressional efforts to punish those who have large 
transactions in the market.  At  the end of July, the parallel ma rket exchange rate stood at 
over 4,200 bolívares per dollar, versus 2,144 pe r dollar for the official rate.  The 
government also continued to conduct interven tion sales of foreign exchange to support 
the bolívar via non-market mechanisms.  On July 27, the central ba nk’s international 
reserves including gold stood at about $25 bi llion, down from $30 billion at end 2006.

In Turkey , real GDP expanded 6.8 percent in the first quarter, on the back of strong 
growth in government consumption and net exports, and the unemployment rate 
decreased slightly.  However, the large curr ent account deficit widened despite strong 
growth in exports.  Industrial  production rose 3.5 percent in May after weakness earlier in 
the year.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation conti nued to edge down in June but remained 
well above the central bank’s 2007 target of 4 percent.  Early results from the recent 
parliamentary election indicate the ruling AK Party will remain in power, as expected. 
Financial markets reacted favorably to the re sults as investors an ticipated the AK Party 
would press ahead with its pro-business re form agenda.  EU accession talks continue, 
although progress on several cri tical chapters has stalled.

In South Africa , indicators on second-quarter perf ormance were mixed.  Manufacturing 
recovered strongly in May, though production in  the mining sector was down.  Because 
of high commodity prices, the value of meta l exports reached a record level in May, 
leading to an improvement in the merchandise trade balance.  However, the trade balance 
worsened again in July as exports fell while  imports increased.  Twelve-month consumer 
price inflation in June was 6.4 percent, maki ng June the third consecutive month in which 
prices have breached the South African Rese rve Bank’s 3-6 percent target range.  The 
sources of inflation are widespread, but food and fuel prices made a combined 
contribution of 3.7 percentage points.  The ou tlook for inflation has worsened somewhat 
IV-46 
as public-sector strikes in June were reso lved with employees receiving a 7.5 percent 
cost-of-living raise.
