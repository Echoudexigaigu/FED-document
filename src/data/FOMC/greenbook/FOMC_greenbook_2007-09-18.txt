Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The incoming nonfinancial economic data, most of which pertain to the period before the 
recent turbulence in financial markets, sugge st that economic activity advanced at a 
moderate pace early in the third quarter.  No tably, retail sales and orders and shipments 
of capital goods posted solid gains in July.  However, residential investment weakened 
further even before the recent disruptions in  mortgage markets.  In addition, private 
payrolls posted only a small gain in August,  and manufacturing production appears to 
have slowed.  Meanwhile, core inflation, although having risen a bit from the unusually 
low rates of increase in the spri ng, remained moderate through July. 
Labor Market Developments 
Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only 24,000 in August, and the levels of 
employment in June and July were revised down.  As a result, priv ate-sector hiring now 
appears to have decelerated further over the summer: Increases averaged about 70,000 
per month over the three months ending in A ugust, compared with gains near 120,000 per 
month in the first five months of this y ear and gains of about 165,000 per month in the 
second half of 2006.1 
The weakness in job gains last month was sp read fairly widely across industries.  
Employment in residential construction and manufacturing posted noticeable declines; 
employment in wholesale trade and transpor tation was little cha nged; and hiring at 
business services was well below recent trends.2  With payroll employment up modestly 
and the workweek flat, aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers 
in August held steady at a le vel 0.2 percent (not at an a nnual rate) above their second-
quarter level. 
However, in contrast to August’s weak em ployment report, othe r indicators do not 
suggest any marked slowdown in labor market  conditions.  Indicators of layoffs—initial 
claims for unemployment insurance, the shor t-term job losers rate from the household 
survey, and the announcements of downsizing plans as measured by Challenger, Gray, 
and Christmas, Inc.—moved up in August but rema ined no higher than readings of earlier  
                                                 
1 A preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to employment for March 2007 is scheduled to be 
announced in October.  The revision could change th e deceleration that is currently registered in the 
employment data. 
2 Because the establishment survey measures empl oyment for the week incl uding the 12th of the 
month, the August data likely do not reflect much of the effect of the recent turmoil in financial markets.   Employment in industries most closely identified with  real estate lending—real estate credit as well as 
mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokers—was flat for a year after the housing market began to soften in 
late 2005 and has fallen substantially since then.  Data for these industries are available only through July.

this year.  Indicators of hi ring—hiring plans in surveys by the National Federation of 
Independent Business (NFIB) and Manpower—were little changed so far this quarter.  
Auxiliary indicators of labor market tightness—the insured unemployment rate and survey measures from the NFIB and the C onference Board—also suggest little change. 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te held steady at 4.6 percent in August, 
0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter  level and equal to its 2006 average.  The 
labor force participation rate dropped back to 65.8 percent—a decline that occurred, 
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, b ecause the relatively late survey reference 
week captured more of the outflow from summe r jobs than usual.  Apart from a few 
months last fall and winter, the labor force participati on rate has hovered between 66.0 
percent and 66.2 percent for more than two years. 
Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose  at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the 
second quarter after a 0.7 percent rate of increase in the first quarter.  Even including this 
acceleration, labor productivity in this sector  rose only 0.9 percent over the four quarters 
ending in 2007:Q2, ¾ percentage point less th an in the comparable period four quarters 
earlier.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production for August will be publis hed on Friday.  The information currently 
in hand suggests that total industrial produc tion (IP) was boosted in August by a weather-
related surge in elect ricity generation.  Meanwhile,  production in the manufacturing 
sector appears to have slowed  following widespread gains in  the preceding two months.  
Manufacturing IP rose 0.6 per cent in June and July, supporte d by solid gains in exports

and a diminishing drag from inve ntories; the advances in ou tput in those months were 
fairly widespread.  Looking forward, alt hough available indicators of manufacturing 
activity have been generally positive, sche duled cuts in motor vehicle production and 
continued weakness in residen tial construction should prove to be a material drag on 
manufacturing IP in the coming months.  As of July, capac ity utilization in 
manufacturing stood 0.9 percentage point above its 1972-2006 average.  
Light motor vehicle production has maintained an average pace a bit below 11 million 
units since June, a noticeable step-up from the low levels of production seen near the turn 
of the year, when automakers cut production to bring their inventories back in line with 
sales.  However, because sales have soften ed, on average, this summer, inventories of 
light vehicles are again some what elevated; days’ supply fo r domestic light vehicles 
stood at 69 at the end of August, a fair bit above  the standard industry target of about 65.  
As a result, industry schedules for September have been pared back to 10.9 million units.  Moreover, initial assembly plans for the f ourth quarter call for production to drop to 
10.2 million units, as automakers expect sales to  remain tepid through the end of the year.  
These schedules are preliminary and frequently  revised.  Nonetheless, if realized, the 
substantial pullback in motor vehicle producti on could subtract up to  1 percentage point 
from the annual rate of change in  total IP in the fourth quarter. 
Output in the high-technology sector increased 1.5 percent in July and thus continued the 
modest acceleration of the preceding few months.  The output of communications 
equipment rose solidly in both June and July, in part because of robust enterprise demand 
for voice and data networking equipment.  In addition, recent industry anecdotes suggest that capital expenditures by telecommunications service pr oviders, which had been 
running a bit on the soft side, will pick up in the second half of the year.  The acceleration 
in production of communications equipment was partly offset by a deceleration in 
computer production, which slowed to a monthl y growth rate of 0.8 percent in June and 
July after an average monthly rate of 3 per cent in the first five months of the year.  
Gartner’s projections for the third quarter show a decline in unit sales of personal 
computers (PCs) as the boost from the reta il release of Microsoft Vista unwinds.   
Production in most categories of  semiconductors rose in June  and July after a period of 
uneven gains earlier this year.  The princi pal constraints on output appear to be 
diminishing:  Semiconductor inventories ar e now at more comfortable levels, and 
industry anecdotes point to rising chip dema nd at manufacturers of PCs, cell phones, and 
consumer electronics.  In particular, Intel recently revised up significantly its third-
quarter revenue guidance to reflect stronger- than-expected demand.  Nevertheless, gains

in semiconductor production during the next fe w months are unlikely to be as strong as 
they were last year.  Looking further ah ead, the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials 
International book-to-bill ratio dropped in July  to its lowest level since May of 2005, a 
sign that chip manufacturers are slowi ng their pace of capacity expansion. 
On balance, production among the major market  groups outside of motor vehicles and 
parts, energy, and high technology rose 0.3 percen t in July after an increase of 0.5 percent 
in June.  The output of consumer goods in creased for the second consecutive month, as a 
rise in consumer nondurables offset declines  in consumer durables such as household 
appliances, carpeting, and furniture.  Pr oduction of business equipment popped up in 
July, on the strength of furt her advances in commercial aircraft and a rebound in the 
output of farm machinery, which had dec lined sharply in Ju ne.  The output of 
construction supplies edged down in July afte r four months of production increases that 
appeared to be driven by gains associated w ith nonresidential constr uction.  The output of 
industrial materials moved up 0.4 percent in July, and gains were  recorded in both 
durable and nondurable materials. 
The preliminary indicators of manufacturing activity in August, such as production 
worker hours and some physical product data, point to a slowdown in production after the 
strong gains in June and July.  In coming months, the direct and upstream effects of 
scheduled reductions in motor vehicle pr oduction and the ongoing contraction in 
residential construction will likely be a drag on IP.  That said, other indicators of near-
term manufacturing activity have been gene rally positive.  The August reading on the 
diffusion index for new orders, as reporte d by the Institute fo r Supply Management 
(ISM), remained at a level consistent with moderate output gains in the coming months, 
and the three-month moving aver age of the change in real adjusted durable goods orders 
showed a modest increase in July.  Moreove r, according to the staff’s flow of goods 
inventory system, inventories in manufactur ing outside of motor vehicles and parts 
appear well aligned with demand.  Finally, dom estic production continues to benefit from 
robust foreign demand.  The export share of manufactured products—defined as the ratio 
of nominal exports to nominal shipments—m oved up further in July from an already 
elevated level in June, and the export orders index from the ISM edged up further in August.

II-13 
Detroit Three automakers, which introduced some targeted incentive programs over the 
course of the month that likely brought b ack some customers who had postponed their 
vehicle purchases while waiting for better deals.3  Vehicle sales in August may also have 
been boosted by the recent declines in gasoline  prices after the steep  run-up in preceding 
months. 
Even with the upturn in August, sales have averaged 15.9 million units at an annual rate 
since the end of the first quarter, down from th e robust rate that prev ailed at the turn of 
the year.  The more moderate sales pace seems consistent with recent indicators of demand.  Consumers’ perceptions of car-buyi ng conditions in the Reuters/University of 
Michigan survey continued to  recover in August from the dip in June.  However, 
sentiment in August was still less buoyant than during the first quarter of 2007, as 
consumers expressed dissatisfaction with ve hicle prices and rema ined anxious about 
gasoline prices.  High gasoline prices continue  to depress the demand for larger vehicles 
such as sport-utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks.  The sl owdown in residential 
construction also is reported to be dampi ng sales of heavier-duty full-size pickup trucks, 
as a sizable portion of these sales are made to  workers in constructi on-related industries.  
Given that weakness in housing ac tivity is likely to persist we ll into next year, sales of 
these vehicles could remain at low levels for an extended period.  Because this segment 
of the market is dominated by the domestic producers, the domestic market share of the 
Detroit Three receded further, on balance, in July and August, from its level in the second 
quarter.  Meanwhile, sales by transplant firms have trended up this year, and data from 
the major Japanese automakers indicate that sales in early Se ptember were higher than in 
August. 
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending appears to have streng thened early this summer from its subdued 
second-quarter pace.  Although auto sales were weak in July, real ou tlays for other goods 
rose briskly.  At the same time, spending on services was up moderately despite a drop in 
outlays for energy services associated with re latively cool weather in  the eastern part of 
the country.   In August, warmer weather lik ely caused an increase in energy usage, and 
vehicle sales stepped up. 
                                                
 
3 The average value of incentives used per light vehicle sale, as measured by J.D. Power and 
Associates, held steady in August.  The incentive prog rams made available in that month were judiciously 
aimed at slow-selling vehicle lines, primarily pickup trucks, and did not escalate into an industrywide event 
sufficiently large to be reflected in this measure of incentives.

II-17 
Real disposable personal income (DPI) incr eased at an annual ra te of 2¾ percent, on 
average, over the first half of this year desp ite the sharp increase in  energy prices.  More 
recently, estimates for July by the Bureau of  Economic Analysis (BEA) show a ½ percent 
increase (not at an annual rate) in real DPI,  as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and 
energy prices came down.4  The personal saving rate fell back in the second quarter after 
jumping in the first quarter on the strengt h of large bonuses.  Smoothing through these 
fluctuations, the saving rate has been on a gra dual upward trend over the past year.  July’s 
small increase continued this trajectory and br ought the saving rate to ¾ percent, about 
1 percentage point higher th an its year-earlier level. 
Despite the robust income gains of late , household wealth is likely providing a 
diminishing impetus to the pace of spending.  Th e ratio of wealth to income flattened out 
in the first half of this year, as a decelera tion in house prices a ppears to have largely 
offset a further rise in stock market wealth.  Thus far in the third quarter, the ratio of 
wealth to income has likely fallen, reflecting r ecent declines in stoc k market wealth and 
an apparent further dece leration in house prices. 
Readings on consumer sentiment from both the Reuters/Michigan and Conference Board 
surveys turned down in August, thereby reversing their July gains.  The August level of 
sentiment was below the level that would nor mally be associated with the prevailing 
values of other indicators (such as infla tion, labor market developments, and stock 
prices), an indication that se ntiment may have been affected  by concerns about the recent 
turmoil in financial markets.5  Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the Michigan 
measure has been drifting down since the start of the year, although the Conference 
Board survey remains in the range it has tracked since early 2006.   
Housing  
The housing sector remains exceptionally weak.  Home sales have moved down 
considerably this year: Sales of new and exis ting single-family homes in July were down  
                                                 
4 The BEA revised down its estimate of the rise in income in the first quarter but revised up its estimate 
for the second quarter; on net, real DPI is now estimated to have risen a little faster than previously 
reported. 
5 An alternative reading on these concerns is prov ided by a special survey conducted August 16-19 by 
the International Co uncil of Shopping Centers, which asked respondents whether “the recent global 
financial problems have or might affect their spending habits.”  The results of this survey are a bit hard to gauge given its one-off nature, but they suggest that the spending plans of the respondents were not materially affected by the situation of financial ma rkets as of the survey da te.  Only 13 percent of 
respondents indicated that they were aware of the situation and were having second thoughts about making 
major or discretionary purchases.

12 percent and 9 percent, respec tively, from their averages over  the second half of last 
year.  Demand this year has been restrained  by deteriorating conditions in the subprime 
mortgage market and by a net increase sin ce early May of 30 basis points in rates for 
thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages.  Recently, the availability of financing to 
borrowers in the nonconforming mortgage mark ets appears to have been crimped even 
further.  Nonprime mortgage originations  (which include both subprime and alt-A 
categories) slowed to a trickle in July and August; spreads between rates for prime 
nonconforming (jumbo) and conforming thirty-y ear fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 
about 1 percentage point in August after ha ving held steady near ¼ percentage point 
since 2001; and lenders have a pparently adopted tighter lendi ng standards for these loans. 
Most forward-looking indicator s of housing demand point to a further deterioration in 
sales in the near term.  The index of pe nding home sales agreem ents—which tends to 
lead existing home sales by one to two m onths—tumbled 12 percen t in July.  Although 
this drop followed an increase of 5 percent in  June, July’s reading is 17 percent below the 
level seen in the second half  of last year.  The Reuter s/Michigan index of homebuyer 
sentiment—which often anticipates substa ntial movements in home sales—dropped 
significantly in August and now shows a four-month decline that  is comparable with the 
one seen when sales began to fall from their peak in the late summ er of 2005.  Anecdotal 
reports from homebuilders suggest that sale s of new homes fell appreciably in August 
and that a lack of confiden ce in the housing market w ould likely restrain demand 
considerably for the rest of the year.  Th e four-week moving average of the mortgage 
purchase index dropped back noticeably in earl y September but still stands well above its 
level in mid-April.  The net increase in th is index since late sp ring may be somewhat 
misleading because of distortions related to  recent developments in nonprime mortgage 
markets.6 
Single-family housing starts slid 7¼ percent to an annual rate of 1.07 million units in 
July—their lowest reading since 1996—and adjusted single-family permit issuance 
continued on a downward trajectory.  Alt hough single-family housing starts have come 
down more than 40 percent from their pea k, they have lagged behind the collapse in 
demand.  As a result, the months’ supply of  new homes has risen considerably, on  
                                                 
6 Among other things, the mortgage purchase index does not sample applications taken by mortgage 
brokers, who issue the overwhelming majority of nonprime loans. Therefore, the index may not adequately reflect the dramatic falloff in new credit to this por tion of the market. In addition, the index measures 
mortgage applications rather than approvals; because mortgage lending standards have become tighter this 
year for many borrowers, a smaller proportion of mortgage applications are likely to have been approved, 
and some borrowers may have applied to a larger number of lenders for a given loan.

balance, this year, and in July it stood about 60 percen t above the upper bound of the 
fairly tight range it had o ccupied between 1997 and the summer of 2005.   
 
  
 
 
 
.  In th e multifamily sector, starts were at an 
annual rate of 311,000 units in Jul y, in line with readings thus far this year and at the low 
end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997. 
House prices have continued to decelerate.  The second-quarter reading of the purchase-
only version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by the Offi ce of Federal Housing 
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was 2.6 per cent higher than it was a year earlier, a 
considerably smaller gain than the 8.2 pe rcent increase posted ove r the preceding four-
quarter period.  The ten-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-price index has 
decelerated even more noticeably and shows an outright decline of 4 percent in the 
twelve months ending in June.7   The average price of existing homes sold—which is 
available on a more timely basis than are these other measures but is not quality 
adjusted—was about unchanged in July relative to twelve months earlier.  The constant 
quality price index for new homes—which adjusts for the geographic composition of 
sales, square footage, and other readily m easurable attributes—w as just 0.6 percent 
higher in the second quarter than four qua rters earlier but down from the 3.9 percent 
appreciation posted in the preceding year.8 
Equipment and Software 
We currently estimate that real spending on equipment and software (E&S) increased at 
an annual rate of 4 percent in the sec ond quarter, moving back up after two weak 
quarters.  Smoothing through that period of softness and the subsequent rebound, spending gains have been modest on average since the middle of 2006 after a period of  
                                                
 
7 Unlike the OFHEO index, which captures only sales backed by conforming mortgage loans, the 
Case-Shiller index reflects all arms-length sales tran sactions in the included cities—Boston, Chicago, 
Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. 
8 Even these quality-adjusted readings on new- home price appreciation may be overstated because 
builders reportedly have stepped up their use of non-price incentives—such as including optional upgrades 
at no cost, granting more-favorable mortgage terms, and paying closing costs—over the past year to bolster 
sales and unload inventory.

more-rapid expansion.  The available data so far for the third quarter point to further 
moderate spending increases. 
The slowdown in the average rate of increa se in business outlays on E&S over the past 
few quarters likely reflects the gradual dece leration in business output since early last 
year.  Although corporate cash reserves have shrunk over the past two quarters, they 
remain at high levels, and the user cost of capital goods has continued to decline.  More 
recently, however, the turmoil in financial ma rkets has raised financing costs for lower-
grade borrowers and may be clouding the environment for business decisionmaking more generally.  Surveys of business conditions —such as those conducted by the ISM, the 
Philadelphia Fed, and the NFIB—are some of  the very few indicators timely enough to 
have been influenced by recent financial even ts.  These measures suggest that increases 
in business activity were some what slower in August than in the second quarter.  The 
August NFIB survey on loan availability show ed some modest deterioration in current 
and expected credit conditions.  
Real outlays on high-tech E&S expanded at an  annual rate of about 9 percent in the 
second quarter on the heels of an even larger gain in the first quarter.  More recently, 
July’s data on computer industrial production and shipments point to solid increases, on 
net, early in the third qua rter.  Shipments of communications equipment dipped 
somewhat in July, but orders remained above  shipments, suggesting that additional gains 
should be in the offing.  The strength in co mmunications spending seen so far this year 
seems to be centered outside of telecommuni cations service providers (TSPs) because it 
reflects gains mainly in items that are not usually purchased by these companies.  By 
contrast, the capital expenditures guidance for TSPs called for a more moderate level of 
spending this year, and industry anecdotes suggest that expenditures in the first half of the year were even a bit belo w the industry’s expectations. 
Real business outlays on transp ortation equipment dropped at an annual rate of nearly 
25 percent in the second quarter, and data for July and August do not point to a rebound 
in the current quarter.  Indicators of busines s-sector spending for motor vehicles have 
been mixed in recent months.   
 sales of medium and heavy trucks fell in  July, continuing a dow nward trajectory that 
began soon after the introduction of more-stringent regulati ons on truck engines at the 
beginning of the year.  However, new orders for medium and heavy trucks increased in 
June and July, signaling that the sales slump may be coming to an end.  That said, the 
outlook for spending on these trucks remains uncertain; freight shipping volumes have been weak in recent months, which our indus try contacts largely attribute to the

slowdown in residential construction.  Aircraft  spending remained at a high level in the 
second quarter after a surge in the first qua rter, but aircraft shipments in July and 
information on Boeing’s deliveries suggest that domestic spending on aircraft is 
retreating somewhat in the third quarter. 
Real business investment in equipment othe r than high-tech and transportation bounced 
back strikingly in the second quarter, increasi ng at an annual rate of  more than 11 percent 
after three consecutive quarterly declines.  Ho wever, the level of sp ending in the second 
quarter remained somewhat below its level a y ear earlier.  In July, imports of this broad 
category rose more than exports, and orders and shipments registered a robust increase, 
pointing to solid increases in business invest ment in the third quart er.  In particular, 
shipments of industrial machinery rebounded in  July after two months of declines.  
Moreover, after having plummeted earlier in the year, shipments of construction 
machinery continued to recover, appare ntly because of increased demand from 
nonresidential construc tion and from abroad. 
Nonresidential Construction  
We currently estimate that real spending on construction of nonresidential buildings 
increased at an annual rate of close to 20 percent in the second  quarter.  Data for the third 
quarter are limited, but the nonfinancial funda mentals remain generally solid.  Vacancy 
rates in this sector are lower than their av erages of the past five years despite having 
edged up in recent quarters.  Furthermore,  the three-month moving average of the 
architectural billings index—which is well co rrelated to spending six months hence—was 
at a high level in July, pointing to strong gains into early next  year.  However, this rosy 
outlook is tempered by the recent turmoil in  credit markets.  Spreads on BBB-rated 
commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)  have risen 94 basis points since early 
August.  Although CMBS do not generally includ e construction loans, the higher cost of 
secondary market financing may put dow nward pressure on prices of existing 
commercial real estate, thereby discou raging new construction projects.

II-27 
The BEA’s preliminary estimate of activity in the drilling and mining sector jumped at an 
annual rate of 48 percent in th e second quarter after a small decline in the first quarter. 
The second-quarter increase stands in contrast  with incoming data for the number of rigs 
in operation, which registered only a small rise in the second quarter.9  Gains in the 
number of rigs in operation remained mode st in July and August, suggesting that 
investment early in the third quarter has been little changed.  Looking forward, anecdotes 
in the most recent Beige Book suggest that ince ntives for further expa nsion of natural gas 
drilling have been damped by recent price d eclines and persistently high inventories. 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory invest ment excluding motor vehicles  increased at a moderate 
annual rate of $9 billion last quarter, the same as in the first quarter.  Book-value data for 
the manufacturing and wholesale trade sector s point to a somewhat slower pace of 
inventory accumulation in July.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales in the 
manufacturing and trade sector , excluding motor vehicles, cha nged little in June after 
declining in previous months from the elev ated levels seen in late 2006.  Information 
from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory sy stem suggests that the months’ supply of 
goods excluding motor vehicles and parts ed ged down in July.  Purchasing managers do 
not appear to see a problem with the level of  their customers’ inventories, as the ISM 
customers’ inventories index m oved back below 50 in August. 
Federal Government Sector 
After having declined stead ily in the past three years,  the federal budget deficit has 
leveled off in recent months, as receipts have decelerated a bit more than outlays.  For the 
twelve months ending in July 2007, the defic it (adjusted for payment-timing shifts and 
financial transaction) was $180 billion, or approximately 1¼ percent of nominal GDP.10 
Although receipts have been rising more slow ly recently, revenues in July still were 
almost 7 percent above their year-earlier level.  Individual income and payroll tax 
revenues, which made up the bulk of receipts in  July, were a robust 8 percent above their  
                                                 
9 To form its quarterly judgmental estimates of real spending in this category,  the BEA extrapolates the 
quantity of drilling forward by using proprietary data  from the American Petroleum Institute (API) on 
footage drilled and estimated cost per foot, a second measure of footage drilled from the Department of 
Energy, and the number of drilling rigs in operation fr om Baker Hughes.  The proprietary data from the 
API receive about 60 percent of the weight in th is calculation and are not available to the staff. 
10 The Congressional Budget Office released an update of its budget outlook on August 23 that 
projected the unadjusted deficit for fiscal 2007 to be $158 billion, which is lower than its estimate of  
$177 billion in March, pr imarily because of greate r-than-expected receipts.

level a year earlier.  In contrast, corporate tax payments were a little below their year-
earlier level.  Data from Daily Treasury St atements indicate that individual income and 
payroll receipts continued to rise at a solid  pace in August, but that corporate revenues 
remained below their level twelve months earlier. 
Federal spending also has been slowing over the past year, but in July outlays rose briskly 
to a level more than 8 percent above their y ear-earlier level.  In  particular, defense 
spending in July was more than 12 percent higher than the level a year earlier.  
Nevertheless, federal spending cumulated over the twelve months ending in July was up 
only 4 percent from its leve l in the year-earlier period. 
Since returning from its recess, the Congr ess has continued to work on the annual 
appropriations bills necessary to fund discre tionary federal spending in fiscal 2008, which 
begins October 1.  So far, the House has passe d all of the twelve a ppropriations bills, but 
the Senate has only passed five, and none has been enacted.  A continuing resolution will 
be needed to fund agencies covered by appropr iations bills that have  not been enacted by 
the start of the new fiscal year. 
State and Local Government Sector 
Taken at face value, the incoming data point to  very weak state and local purchases in the 
third quarter.  According to the most recent employment report, state and local 
employment fell 26,000 in August after having dropped 58,000 in July.  Much of the recent weakness is in local education, where employment is reported to have fallen a cumulative 100,000 between May and August af ter having increased substantially 
between mid-2006 and the spring of this year.  Given the usual volatility of these data in 
summer months—as well as their apparent inconsistency with other information on 
activity in the sector—we w ould not be surprised to s ee either significant upward 
revisions to the published data or a dramatic rebound in hiring in September.  Meanwhile, 
real construction spending app ears to have retained consid erable vigor in July after 
having risen appreciably in the first half of the year.  
On the whole, state fiscal positi ons remain sound.  The preliminary State Budget & Tax 
Actions 2007  report from the National Conference of  State Legislatures  (NCSL) suggests 
that states in the aggregate experienced a he fty increase in general-fund spending in fiscal 
2007 (which ended on June 30 in most states) but  still finished the year with sizable

balances in their reserve funds.11  That said, current fiscal  conditions do not have the 
luster that was evident a year ago, mainly be cause revenue inflows have tapered off after 
a period of outsized increases.12  According to the NCSL, a ggregate reserve balances at 
the end of fiscal 2007 were somewhat smalle r than those at the end of fiscal 2006, and 
with spending slated to rise moderately in  fiscal 2008 (and revenues expected to remain 
subdued), reserves may decline further over th e coming year.  Moreove r, several states 
are concerned about budget pr ospects beyond the current fiscal year.  For example, 
California adopted a budget in late  August that is expected to be balanced for fiscal 2008; 
however, if current policies remain in place,  the state is likely to face significant 
operating shortfalls in 2009 and 2010. 
Prices 
After rapid increases earlier th is year, headline consumer price inflation was moderate in 
both June and July as energy prices fell.  Ov er the twelve months ending in July, total 
PCE prices were up about 2 percent, down from the 3½ percent in crease posted over the 
previous twelve months.  Excluding food and energy, PCE inflation also has been 
moderate in recent months, although it has drif ted up a touch from its very low rates this 
spring.  Despite the recent vola tility in energy prices, long-run inflation expectations have 
remained within the range that has prevai led during much of the past few years. 
Core PCE prices rose 0.2 per cent in June and 0.1 percent in July.  Although quite modest, 
these increases were enough to cause the three-month change in  core PCE prices to edge 
up to 1.6 percent in July from 1.1 percent in May.  The latest three-month change was 
boosted by prices of apparel and housing serv ices, both of which moved up after low 
readings in the spring.  On a twelve-mont h-change basis, core PCE inflation has 
decelerated from 2.3 percent in July 2006 to  1.9 percent in July 2007.  Step-downs in 
price inflation for prescriptions drugs, moto r vehicles, and nonmarket services account 
for nearly all of the deceleration in core PC E prices.  Although owners’ equivalent rent 
decelerated over the past year, this change  was largely offset by an acceleration in 
tenants’ rent and lodging away from home; on balance, changes in the prices of housing  
                                                 
11 The NCSL tabulation is based on information from the forty-five states that had fiscal 2008 budgets 
in place as of late July.  It is missing information fr om California, Illinois, Mi chigan, North Carolina, and 
Wisconsin, which together account for more than  one-fourth of state general-fund totals.  
12 According to unpublished preliminary estimates fro m the Rockefeller Institute, state tax collections 
increased 5 percent on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2007 after having posted double-digit increases over the preceding three year s.  Personal income taxes rose 8 pe rcent on a year-over-year basis in 
the second quarter, whereas sale s taxes and corporate income ta xes each rose about 2 percent.

services were not an important contributor to  the past year’s decel eration in core PCE 
inflation. 
Energy prices declined 1 percent in July af ter having fallen ½ percent in June.  Gasoline 
prices moved down 1¾ percent in July and appe ar to have dropped even more in August, 
even though inventories remain near the lo w end of their normal range.  These recent 
declines in gasoline prices have coincided w ith a sharp narrowing of the margin between 
retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices and their m ove to more-normal levels after 
reaching record highs in May.  Despite some large swings, PCE energy prices as of July 
stood only ½ percent higher than their year-earlier level.  In contrast, energy-price 
increases ranged from 14 percent to 22 per cent in each of the preceding three years. 
In July, food prices continued their string of  sizable increases obs erved since January.  
Some of this year’s increase reflects the difficulty of quickly expanding livestock herds 
and flocks, which had been pruned earlier in  response to low pri ces, but a significant 
portion of the step-up appears to be a pass-th rough of high corn prices, which have been 
boosted by strong demand for ethanol.  Corn pr ices have fallen back over the past few 
months, although the spot price remains about 40 percent higher than it was a year ago.  
Prices of some other grains, including wheat and soybeans, have surged as well, because 
output was reduced by adverse weather and a sh ift of acreage to corn production.  Over 
the twelve months ending in July, the PC E price index for food and beverages has 
increased 4 percent, compared with a rise of 2¼ percent in the previous year.  The 
acceleration has been most apparent for comestibles for which corn is a major input; for instance, beef prices in July  were up 6½ percent from a year  earlier, poultry prices were 
up nearly 8 percent, milk prices had jump ed 18 percent, and egg prices had surged 
34 percent.  By contrast, for food in purchas ed meals—a relatively stable component of 
consumer price inflation for which labor is a much larger share of overall costs—prices 
were 3½ percent higher in July than a y ear earlier, an accele ration of only about 
½ percentage point from the previous twelve months. 
Measures of inflation expectations re main moderate.  As measured by the 
Reuters/Michigan survey, the median expecta tion for year-ahead inflation declined to 
3.2 percent in August—still 0.2 percentage point above its level at th e turn of the year—
and the median expectation over the next five to ten years fell to 2.9 percent, the low end 
of the range seen in the past couple of years.  Readings on inflation expectations over the 
next ten years in the Survey of Professional Forecasters were mixed:   CPI expectations 
were unchanged in August, at 2.4 percent, while PCE price expect ations—used in the 
FRB/US model—edged up to 2.1 percent.  Fi ve-year inflation compensation derived

from TIPS ticked down since the time of th e August Greenbook, but forward inflation 
compensation over the subsequent five years is unchanged. 
Price increases for goods at earlier stages of  processing have slowed recently.  The PPI 
for core intermediate materials increased 0.2 percent in July, to a level only 2½ percent 
above its level a year earlier; the modest ri se was considerably le ss than the 8 percent 
increase over the preceding twelve months, as  prices for most energy-intensive products 
have decelerated over the past year.  Since the August Greenbook, commodity prices 
have dropped, even though they remain considerab ly higher than their ye ar-earlier levels.  
The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has fallen 3¼ percent since the 
August Greenbook, and the Commodity Research Bu reau’s index of industrial spot prices 
has dropped 7½ percent. 
Labor Costs 
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sect or rose at an annual rate of 4 percent 
in the second quarter after having increased at  an upward-revised rate  of 6 percent in the 
first quarter.  The increase over the past f our quarters—5¾ percent—is noticeably above 
the increase in the preceding four quarters and also well above the increase seen in the 
employment cost index (ECI) over the same period.13  Combined with the deceleration in 
output per hour, the compensation data imply that unit labor costs have continued to 
accelerate, with the change over the four quart ers ending in 2007:Q2 at 5 percent.  As a 
result, the markup of nonfarm business prices over unit labor costs has fallen back from 
its peak at the end of la st year, although it remains above its long-run average. 
More recently, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 
increased 0.3 percent in both July and Augus t, putting the twelve-month change in this 
measure of wages at 3.9 per cent, only a little below the ch ange for the twelve months 
ending in August 2006. 
                                                 
13 In the preliminary GDP release,  the BEA revised downward its esti mate of bonuses that accrued in 
the fourth quarter.  However, becau se the BEA will not revise its four th-quarter NIPA estimates until the 
next annual revision, the published levels of compensation per hour and unit labor costs for the fourth 
quarter of 2006 and onward will be overstated.  As a re sult, the current four-quarter changes in these series 
are overstated by 0.4 percentage point.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Amid heightened unease about exposure to subprime mortgages and about structured 
credit products more generally, conditions in  short-term funding markets deteriorated 
significantly after the August 7 FOMC meeting.  Rates jumped on both asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP) and unsecured commercial paper from lower-rated issuers, and the outstanding amount of paper contracted  sharply.  Increased desire for liquidity 
put upward pressure on interbank lending rate s and resulted in impaired functioning in 
term interbank funding markets.  In response,  the Federal Reserve took several measures 
to support liquidity.  These ac tions and announcements seemed to improve conditions in 
overnight markets, but considerable stress has remained in the commercial paper and 
term funding markets.    Investors significantly marked down their expe cted path for the federal funds rate and 
now appear virtually certain that the FOMC  will ease policy at this meeting.  Largely 
reflecting the change in policy expectations, two-year nominal Treasury yields declined 
about 50 basis points since the August 7 FOMC  meeting, and ten-year yields decreased 
about 35 basis points.  In corporate securitie s markets, yields on investment-grade and 
speculative-grade bonds declined—albeit so mewhat less than Treasury yields—and 
equity prices were volatile but about uncha nged on balance.  In the household sector, 
securitization of nonconforming mortgages rema ined very limited and credit conditions 
tightened further for borrowers seeking those types of loans. 
 
Money Market Functioning 
Days after the August 7 FOMC meeting, U.S.  and European commercial paper markets 
came under severe pressure after a large fo reign bank suspended redemptions at some 
high-yield money funds it sponsored that held relatively large positions in ABCP.  As 
yields on ABCP spiked, investors sought the relative safety of short-term Treasury 
securities and yields on three-month Treasur y bills dropped sharply.  Functioning in the 
bill market was notably impaired at times,  with reports of exceptionally high bid-ask 
spreads.  In the repo market, the demand fo r Treasury collateral increased sharply, 
particularly in the bill segment, and overnig ht repo rates for general collateral fell far 
below the federal funds rate.  Unsecured bank funding markets also showed signs of 
stress, including volatile overnight interbank le nding rates, elevated term interbank rates, 
and illiquidity in term funding markets.  The Federal Reserve responded to strained c onditions in short-term markets in a number 
of ways.  On August 9 and 10, the Trading Desk  provided significant levels of balances

to the banking sector, and on August 10, the Federal Reserve announced that it would 
“provide reserves as necessary  through open market operations  to promote trading in the 
federal funds market” and noted that “the discount window is avai lable as a source of 
funding.”  On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market 
conditions had deteriorated and that “tighter  credit conditions and increased uncertainty 
have the potential to restra in economic growth going forward.”  That day, the Federal 
Reserve temporarily reduced the primary credit rate 50 basis points and announced 
changes in practices to allow the provision of term primary credit to large as well as small 
depository institutions.  Later, the Federal Re serve clarified the acceptability of some 
ABCP as collateral for discount window borrowi ng, and, to help ease pr essures in the bill 
market, the Trading Desk announced a tem porary reduction—from 100 basis points to  
50 basis points—in the minimum fee for borrowi ng securities from the SOMA Securities 
Lending Facility.    These actions by the Federal Reserve repor tedly helped improve conditions in the 
Treasury bill market and in overnight funding markets.  For example, the spread between 
the federal funds rate and the corresponding Treasury general co llateral rate has returned 
to more normal levels.  Although the level of the effective federal funds rate has 
remained somewhat below the target rate, trad ing liquidity in the ove rnight federal funds 
market has appeared ample, with record leve ls of brokered volumes.  In contrast to 
overnight money markets, liquidity in term  funding markets has remained poor and term 
premiums in short-dated securities have b een quite elevated.  In addition, the spread 
between one-month libor and overnight inde x swaps has stayed exceptionally wide, 
suggesting a persistent reluctance among banks to commit term funds.

Interest Rates and Policy Expectations  
Over the intermeeting period, ongoing developmen ts in short-term credit markets and a 
few key data releases drove down the expected path for the federal funds rate.  The FOMC’s decision at its August 7 meeting to l eave the target federal funds rate unchanged 
at 5¼ percent, the accompanying statement, and the subsequent release of the minutes were all about in line with market expecta tions, and reactions in financial markets were 
muted.  Neither the August 10 nor the Augus t 17 statements by the Federal Reserve  
                                                
 
1 An overnight index swap (OIS) is a fixed/floating inte rest rate swap, with the floating leg tied to an index 
of daily overnight rates, such as federal funds.  Two parties exchange at maturity, based on the agreed notional amount, the difference betwee n interest accrued at the fixed rate and interest accrued through 
geometric averaging of the floating or index rate.  OIS contracts are used to hedge or to speculate on 
movements in overnight interest rates in all major currencies.

elicited large changes in interest rates.  Mo re recently, weaker-than-expected reports on 
housing activity and employment appeared to so lidify market expectations for an easing 
of policy at the September meeting.  Binary opt ions on the target federal funds rate after 
the upcoming meeting suggest that investors now assign r oughly even odds to 50 and  
25 basis point reductions in th e target funds rate at the upcoming meeting.  The Desk’s 
survey of primary dealers suggests similar expectations for the policy decision, and many 
dealers report that they expect the Committ ee’s statement to indicate that downside risks 
to growth are the predominant policy concern.   Looking further ahead, futures market quotes impl y that the expected federal funds rate at 
the end of 2008 is now about 4 percent, roughl y 50 basis points lower than at the time of 
the August FOMC meeting.  The distribution of  the expected federal funds derived from 
options widened considerably since early A ugust, and Eurodollar-imp lied volatilities six 
and twelve months ahead hit multiyear highs in  mid-August.  In line with this rise in 
volatility, several indicators suggest that  term premiums along the Eurodollar curve 
jumped over the intermeeting period.    Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 50 basis points, on net, since August 6, 
as investors marked down the expected path of monetary policy.  Five- and ten-year 
nominal Treasury yields declined about 50 a nd 35 basis points respectively.  Quotes on 
TIPS suggest that almost all of the decreases in these yields can be attributed to real 
yields.  Thus, implied inflation compensation over the next five years and five to ten 
years ahead were both about unchanged.    
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity price indexes we re volatile over the intermeeti ng period, but the net changes 
were small.  After reaching a peak in mid- August, options-implied volatility retreated, 
though it remained well above its range for most of the past several years.  The spread 
between the twelve-month forward trend ear nings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a 
real long-run Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—opened up a bit 
more over the intermeeting period after having wi dened in late July and early August.   
 Conditions in the commercial paper market de teriorated markedly over the intermeeting 
period.  The difficulties were triggered by a pprehension about potential losses associated 
with mortgage-related assets in ABCP program s, but they then spread to other ABCP 
programs and to lower-rated unsecured comm ercial paper programs as well.  ABCP 
spreads soared to record levels, and some conduits, particularly those holding mortgage

assets, were unable to roll over maturing paper.  These developments led several 
programs to draw on backup lines, extend the matur ity of their paper, or even to default.  
On a seasonally adjusted ba sis, total ABCP outstanding has dropped nearly 20 percent 
since the August 7 FOMC meeting.    Yields on investment-grade and speculative- grade corporate bonds fe ll a little less than 
those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, leavin g their spreads slightly above the already 
higher levels prevailing at the time of the August 7 FOMC meeting.  Both investment-
grade and speculative-grade bond spreads are near  their highest levels in four years, 
although they are still far belo w the peaks seen in mid-2002. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Both the NIPA measures and S&P earnings per share point to further increases in profits 
in the second quarter, although the pace was more moderate than it was a year ago.  Revisions to analysts’ year-a head expected earnings per share for the S&P 500 were 
slightly positive through mid- August.  Since then, however , expectations have likely 
deteriorated after a number of financial firms warned that credit market losses would hold 
down their profits in the near term.  Among financial firms, profit expectations for 
investment banks were marked down further as  analysts factored in a drop-off in fees 
from reduced leveraged buyout activity.  Over the intermeeting period, the available meas ures of corporate cr edit quality remained 
strong, but they generally reflect  conditions before the onset of financial turmoil.  In the 
second quarter, the liquidity of nonfinancial  corporate balance sheets stayed high by 
historical standards, while leverage rose s lightly from low levels .  Rating downgrades on 
corporate bonds continued to be modest in July, and the six-month trailing bond default 
rate remained near zero through August.  KM V’s aggregate year-ahead expected default 
rate also stayed near record lows in July.  
 
Business Finance 
After having been tepid in July, gross bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial 
corporations rebounded strongl y last month, whereas sp eculative-grade issuance 
increased only a touch.  Speculative-grade  bond deals and leveraged loans slated to 
finance LBOs have continued to be delayed or restructured.  Outstanding nonfinancial 
commercial paper dipped in August, although the contraction was small in comparison 
with that for ABCP.  C&I lending surged in  August, reportedly as some banks funded

leveraged loans that they had intended to syndicate to nonbank investors and perhaps as 
some firms substituted bank credit for commercial paper.   Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial co rporations slowed to  a trickle in August; 
the drop probably reflected both seasonal weakne ss and the effects of recent volatility in 
equity markets.  Equity retirements conti nued unabated in the s econd quarter, and early 
indications are that repurchases remain ed robust through August, as did equity 
retirements associated with cash-financed  mergers and acquisitions.  In contrast, 
announcements of new LBOs essentially came to a halt in August.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of rates on investment-grade commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened substantially.  The recen t increase in CMBS spreads reflects both 
concerns among investors and rating agencies  over the higher leverage on recently 
securitized commercial mortgage s and greater concerns about structured finance products 
in general.  The increase in CMBS spr eads has reportedly caused interest rates on 
commercial mortgages originated for securiti zation to increase about 25 basis points. 
 In the second quarter, investor concerns about  higher leverage led to an increase in the 
subordination rate—the share of the CMBS pool  that must default before holders of a 
given tranche must absorb any losses— for newly securitized BBB-rated CMBS.  
According to measures of loan quality from rating agencies, most loans originated in the 
second quarter that were intended for securiti zation in the third qua rter remained highly 
leveraged.  There are signs of improving lo an quality for mortgages intended for 
securitization—the share of newly originated  commercial mortgages with loan-to-value 
ratios at or above 80 percent, an indicator of the future qua lity of loans in CMBS pools, 
has shown some improvement in recent months.  Commercial mortgage debt ro se briskly in the second quart er, amid continued increases 
in the price of commercial real estate prope rties and the uptrend in leverage observed last 
spring.  The elevated pace of borrowing appears to have carried into the third quarter, as a 
backlog of loans originated earlier this year  has kept issuance of CMBS high.  There are 
indications that higher borrowing costs a nd tighter underwriting standards may be 
beginning to hold down the volume of commercial  real estate lending.  These indicators 
include a notable increase in canceled sales contracts in July, slower growth of

commercial mortgages extended by banks in Ju ly and August, and a lighter calendar of 
CMBS slated for issuance in the fourth quarter.  Nonetheless, fundamentals in th e commercial real esta te sector continue to be solid.  In 
the second quarter, the vacancy rate on commerc ial properties remained low relative to its 
range earlier this decade, and commercial rent s continued to post moderate gains.  As a 
result, delinquency rates on most types of co mmercial real estate loans have remained 
low.    
Household Finance  
On a year-over-year basis, growth of home mortgage debt slowed again in the second 
quarter, a decrease broadly consistent with the lower pace of home sales and the sharp 
deceleration in home-price appreciation.  Consumer credit continued to expand 
moderately through July.  Delinquency rates on most types of consumer loans have crept up in recent quarters, but the levels have generally remained in the lo wer portion of their historical ranges.  In 
contrast, the performance of nonprime mort gages has deteriorated further.  The 
delinquency rate on subprime variable-rate mort gages increased in July to a level well 
above the peak observed during the recession in 2001; the de linquency rate for variable-
rate loans in alt-A pools, although much lowe r, has also increased noticeably.  In the 
prime mortgage sector, the delinquency rate on the aggregate of all such loans remained 
low through June, even though the rate for the jumbo mortgages in th is aggregate roughly 
doubled over the preceding year.  Fo reclosure starts remained at  an elevated level in the 
second quarter, with a further increase among borrowers with subprime mortgages 
offsetting a decline for prime borrowers.  The available evidence suggests extremel y limited securitization activity for the 
nonprime and jumbo mortgage markets in r ecent weeks.  With their funding options 
constrained, lenders are reporte dly offering prime jumbo mortgages with higher rates and 
more-selective terms and are holding the loan s on their balance sheets.  Meanwhile, the 
supply of credit to borrowers  who qualify for conforming mortgage loans has been 
relatively unaffected by developments in ot her segments of the mortgage market.  
Issuance of agency-backed MBS was strong th rough July, particularly in comparison 
with the level seen in the subpr ime, alt-A, and jumbo markets.

The OFHEO index of prices for purchased homes  rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in 
the second quarter, down from an upward-revise d pace of 3¼ percent in the first quarter.  
According to the S&P/Case-Shiller index, home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan 
markets fell 4 percent for the year ending in July, and futures quotes on that index 
suggest that market participants expect  some further decline in coming months. 
 The ratio of household net worth to disposab le income ticked up in the second quarter, 
but the net decline in stock pr ices since the beginning of July should reduce net worth in 
the current quarter.  Long-term mutual funds  had sizable net outflows in August that may 
have signaled a decreased appetite for risk.  In contrast, money market funds received 
near-record monthly inflows last month.  
Treasury and Agency Finance 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auc tioned two-, five-, ten-, and thirty-year 
coupon securities.  Demand at the auction fo r the two-year Treasury note was reportedly 
quite strong, and the bid-to-cover ratio was well above average.  Bid-to -cover ratios at the 
other auctions were in their typical ranges.  Indirect bidd ing, an indicator of foreign 
demand, was roughly in line with recent leve ls.  Despite the recent financial market 
turmoil, the cash market for these securities generally functioned well, with fairly high 
trading volumes.  However, heightened volatil ity in the secondary market for Treasury 
bills reportedly caused dealers to be reluctan t to bid at some bill auctions, which resulted 
in very low bid-to-cover ratios.  Yield spreads on debt issued by government-spons ored enterprises (GSEs) spiked notably 
in mid-August but then receded.  Net debt  issuance by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has 
been light because of the portfolio caps  imposed on these GSEs by their regulator. 
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds for new capital projects and for advance 
refunding declined somewhat further in Augus t amid a jump in the ratio of long-term 
municipal bond yields to those of comparable -maturity Treasury securities.  Meanwhile, 
short-term issuance picked up in August—its typical season al pattern.  The perceived 
credit quality of municipal bonds appeared to  deteriorate somewhat in August, even as 
the number of ratings upgrades outpaced downgr ades.  The primary source of investors’ 
concerns about credit quality was the possibl e exposure of municipa l bond insurers to 
subprime mortgages, which contributed to th e spike in the municipal bond yield ratio.

Money and Bank Credit 
M2 increased at an annual ra te of about 10½ percent in August.  The increase was led by 
a surge in liquid deposits and retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in 
response to recent financial market turmoil.  Small time deposits, which had been rather 
sluggish, showed some notable inflows during the last two weeks of August, as some 
depository institutions bid aggressively to obtain this source of funds.    Commercial bank credit is estimated to have  risen sharply in August, as total loans 
expanded vigorously—mainly at large banks.  In addition to the jump in C&I loans, “other” loans surged, in part  because of short-term exte nsions to nonbanks and unplanned 
overdrafts.  The sharp increase in unplanned overdrafts appears to be consistent with 
some banks having extended backup fina ncing to commercial paper conduits.  
Commercial real estate loans also expande d solidly last month, although the average pace 
over July and August was only about half that re gistered during the firs t half of the year.  
On the household side, banks’ holdings of loan s backed by residential real estate were 
about flat in August, held down in part by some loan sales, but originations of consumer 
loans rose noticeably.  Total securities held  by banks increased moderately last month, 
partly because of a few large banks’ purchases of commercial paper.      According to the latest Call Report data, th e profitability of the commercial banking 
industry held about steady at a high rate in the second quarter, with a further narrowing of 
banks’ net interest margin about offset by ga ins in non-interest income and reductions in 
non-interest expense.  Banks’ rate of provisi oning for loan losses moved higher for the 
third straight quarter, but the increase was sma ller than in the previous two quarters.  The 
delinquency rate on all loans and leases moved higher for the fourth straight quarter, pushed up by a further rise in delinquencies on bo th residential real estate loans and loans 
to finance the construction of residential properties.
2  However, delinquency rates on 
other major loan categories we re little changed last quart er, and the overall delinquency 
rate on bank loans remained well below its long-run average level.   
                                                 
2 In March 2007, banks began reporting new Call Report memorandum items on loans outstanding, charge-
offs, and delinquencies that split construction and land development loans into “1-4 family residential 
construction loans,” “other construction loans,” an d “all land development and other land loans.”  
According to these new data, the delinquency rate on the residential construction portion of construction and land development loans rose to 3.1 percent at the end of Q2 from 2.4 percent in Q1, whereas the delinquency rate on the remaining portion of such loans only increased about 10 basis points in Q2, to  
1.8 percent.

In July, the value of exports of goods and serv ices increased 2.7 percen t.  Sharp increases 
in exports of both aircraft and automobiles c ontributed importantly to the overall gain.  
Exports of agricultural products and consumer  goods were also st rong.  In contrast, 
exports of industrial supplies and se miconductors exhibited declines.   
 
The value of exports in the second quarter increased 14.9 percent (a.r.), as exports 
increased briskly in June following strong grow th in May.  Exports of agricultural goods, 
automotive products, and industria l supplies exhibited particular  strength in the second 
quarter.  In contrast, exports of capital goods rose modestly, reflecting declines in aircraft and computers that partially offset str ong growth in other capital goods.  In the 
preliminary NIPA release, real exports of goods and services were reported to have risen 7.6 percent, with both exports  of goods and services e xhibiting strong growth.

IV-4 
The value of imported goods and services ro se 1.8 percent in July, boosted by a large 
increase in imports of automotive products.  Higher imports of oil and capital goods 
excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors  also contributed to the overall gain in 
imports.  Imports of non-oil industrial suppl ies, consumer goods, and services all 
recorded moderate increases, whereas imports of aircraft, computers, and semiconductors 
declined.   
 
In the second quarter, the value of imports rose 10.1 percent (a.r.), with imports growing 
only modestly in June following a large gain in May.  The increase in the second quarter 
entirely reflects higher import pr ices, as real imports, accord ing to the preliminary NIPA 
release, actually dec lined 3.2 percent.  In particular , import prices for oil and other 
industrial supplies surged in the second quarter, driving up th e nominal value of imports.  
In contrast, the value of imports of auto motive products and consumer goods declined. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In July, prices for U.S. imports of core goods rose 0.3 percent, after 
rising 0.1 percent in June.  Material-intensive goods led the way after being flat in the 
previous month.  Prices for imported food s hot up in July, and prices for non-fuel 
industrial supplies moved up afte r a slight decline in June.  The food price increase was 
almost entirely due to a sharp rebound in vege table prices, which had plunged in the two 
previous months.  Within non-fuel industrial supplies, prices in a number of categories fell in July, including prices for copper and aluminum, but a spike in prices for imported 
building materials more than offset those d eclines.  Prices for imported finished goods 
rose 0.2 percent, with prices of capital goods  accounting for most of the increase.  
Outside of core goods, prices for imported  computers were flat, and prices for 
semiconductors fell modestly. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose  7 percent in July, following a 4½ percent 
increase in June.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased 
about 9 percent in July.  Movi ng into August, the spot pri ce of WTI fell rapidly before 
retracing much of this decline late in the month and into early-September.  Smoothing 
through these ups and downs, spot WTI averag ed about $72 per barrel  in August, just 
$2 per barrel lower than its July average.  On September 11, OPEC announced that it will 
increase its production target by 500,000 barrels  per day.  Despite this news, the spot 
price of WTI rose to a record high of  $78.24 per barrel, refl ecting skepticism among 
market participants that actual OPEC production will increase significantly.

Exports.   In July, prices for U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.2 percent, after rising 
0.5 percent in June .  Prices for material-intensive expor ts were flat in the month, as a 
jump in prices for agricultural products was offset by a fall in prices for nonagricultural 
industrial supplies.  As in June , higher prices for meat and grain led the surge in prices 
for agricultural products.  For nonagricultural industrial s upplies, prices fo r iron and steel 
fell sharply and prices for aluminum also d eclined.  Prices for e xported finished goods 
rose 0.3 percent, with higher prices for expor ted consumer goods re gistering the largest 
increase.  Prices for exported computers fe ll, whereas prices of exported semiconductors 
edged up.    
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
After recording very strong net purchases in the f
 irst half of the year, foreign private 
investors on net sold U.S. securities in July, th e first outflow recorded in nearly four years 
(line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) .  Foreign demand was 
weak for all types of U.S. long-term debt  securities, especially for corporate and 
municipal bonds (line 4c).  For these bonds, foreign residents sold, on net, $12 billion in 
July.  This was the first such net sale sin ce July 1993, and a sharp change from purchases 
of $63 billion in May and $15 billion in June (middle-left panel of the chart on Private Security Flows).  Foreigners also sold, on net, agency bonds (line 4b), while their 
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were cl ose to zero (line 4a).  The largest sale of 
U.S. Treasury bonds was recorded against the Cayman Islands;  
 
.  Large sales were  also recorded against Japan, perhaps 
attributable to an unwinding of yen-carry trades.  There were net purchases recorded 
against Europe.  We note that the weakness in foreigners’ acq uisitions coincided with an 
unusually low issuance of U.S. corporate bonds  during July and an increase in the 
number of downgrades of mortgage-backed securities.  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. 
equities also slowed in July but re mained robust at $18 billion (line 4d).  
 Partially offsetting the sales of U.S. securi ties, the banking sector
  (line 3) posted an 
especially large net inflow of  $67 billion during July; a significant portion of this inflow 
owes to an increase in banks’ own liabilities ag ainst the Cayman Islands.  Further, half of 
the bank inflow reflects foreign purchases of short-term U.S. securities other than U.S. 
Treasury bills (which are included in line 4), including commercial paper ($12 billion) 
and certificates of deposit ($16 billion).  
 

IV-8 
U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities tota led only $7 billion in July (line 5 and the 
bottom panels of the chart on Private Security Flows), roughly 1/3 of th e total recorded in 
June.  Most of the weakening in July’s acquisitions was recorded against the United 
Kingdom, which yields little conclusive info rmation as to the ultimate destination of 
these flows as many non-U.K. s ecurities trade on U.K. exchanges.  The weakening of 
U.S. demand was most notable for foreign bonds (line 5a) and ma y just reflect the 
significant contraction in international bond issuance by foreigners. 
 
Foreign official inflows picked up to $44 billi on in July (line 1 and top-left panel of the 
chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows).  
 
 
 
 
 
.  Howe ver, for the past year, the timing of official 
purchases of U.S. securities (line 1) has r oughly coincided with increases in the custody 
accounts at the FRBNY.   Combining official flows with private banki ng and private security flows yields a net 
inflow in July of $97 billion, above the pace of the second q
uarter.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
At the time of the August FOMC meeting, several banks , including the German bank 
IKB Deutsche Industriebank, had begun to come  under stress as they were called to 
extend credit to asset-backed commercial paper programs that they had sponsored and 
that had been used to fund purchases of U.S. mortgage-backed securities.  Many banks increased their demand for liquidity on fears that there would be further draws on the 
credit lines that they had extended to co mmercial paper programs, placing pressure on 
overnight funding markets.  Amid these fears,  news on August 9 that the French bank 
BNP Paribas was restricting redemptions on th ree of its investment funds triggered a 
sharp market reaction, sending ove rnight rates well above centr al bank targets in most of 
the advanced foreign economies. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the central banks of Australia, Norway, and 
Switzerland all conducted special market ope rations over the following week to inject 
liquidity into overnight funding markets. 
Although central bank actions helped to partially stabilize overnigh t interest rates, 
concerns over liquidity led to funding difficulties in money markets at any but the shortest maturities.  Premiums on 1- and 3-m onth interbank offer rates rose by as much as 
60 basis points as financial institutions began to hoard the most liquid securities.  These 
disruptions to domestic m oney markets also sharply im paired funding flows between 
money markets in the United St ates and Europe.  According to market participants, bid-
ask spreads in the foreign exchange swap market rose up to 20 times their normal levels on August 9 and 10 and volumes were about on e tenth the normal amounts.  European 
firms accustomed to accessing U.S. money ma rkets for longer-term funding and using the 
foreign exchange swaps market to convert  that funding back to euros may have 
experienced especially painful funding problem s as a result.  Term-money markets have 
yet to recover and premiums remain elevate d, despite actions by th e Federal Reserve and 
the European Central Bank to make longer-term funding available and decisions by the 
Bank of Canada and the Reserve Banks of Aust ralia and of New Zealand to widen the set 
of securities that would be accep ted as collateral.        
 
Problems with asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) have surfaced in almost all of the 
major markets.  In Germany, in addition to IKB, Sachsen Landesbank was also unable to 
fund its ABCP conduit.  The British special  investment vehicle Cheyne Finance was 
forced to liquidate its assets and HBOS and Barclays both announced that they would 
expend funds to aid ABCP conduits that they  had helped to esta blish.  In Canada, a 
IV-13 
conduit of the financial services company Coventree failed to roll its ABCP and 
numerous Canadian ABCP issuers requested to draw on their liquidity backstops.   
Commercial paper issuance slowed in most c ountries, particularly issuance of ABCP.  
Overall corporate bond issuance also fell markedly in the advanced foreign economies 
over July and August, and investment-grade  corporate bond spreads have continued to 
rise modestly.  Despite the continued financ ial turmoil, spreads on sub-investment grade 
credit default swaps have stabilized, though at high levels.   
 
The trade-weighted exchange value of the do llar against its major trading partners has 
declined 1½ percent ove r the intervening period, but the do llar has appreciated a bit less 
than ⅓ percent against its other important trad ing partners.  The yen has appreciated 
almost 3¾ percent against the dollar as height ened market volatility has encouraged the 
unwinding of carry trades, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars, popular targets of 
carry trade funds, have deprecia ted 2 and 7 percent respectively  against the U.S. dollar.  
Major global equity markets fell sharply over the first half of A ugust, but have since 
partially rebounded as the stream of headlines related to credit troubles has moderated.  
Financial and bank stocks were pa rticularly hard hit, even in  Japan, which is believed to 
have only limited exposure to the U.S. subprim e-mortgage sector and has had only small 
losses related to it.  Implied volatilities on the major equity indexes peaked in 
mid-August near levels last seen in 2002.  
 
Emerging economy financial markets were a ffected by the turmoil in the advanced 
economies, with some illiquidity occurring in  their foreign exchange and bond markets; 
however, investors appeared to discrimina te among countries, a nd better performing 
economies have so far suffered fewer conse quences.  The exchange values of many 
emerging market currencies declined agains t the dollar and most emerging market stock 
indexes declined in mid-August at the height of market turmoil, but in most cases have 
since at least partially reversed.  Although th e Chinese renminbi depreciated against the 
dollar over the first half of August, it has since appreciated and is now ⅔ percent higher 
than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  The Chinese stock market has been largely 
unaffected by the recent turmoil, increasing 11 percent since the August FOMC meeting.  
The People's Bank of China raised benchmark interest rates at financial institutions for renminbi deposits and lending again on August 21, but this has had little effect on stock prices.  In a move intended to help remove differences between on-shore and off-shore 
equity prices, the Chinese government announced that residents would be permitted to 
invest directly in Hong Kong-lis ted securities, but subsequen tly postponed the removal of 
controls.

.  The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of the System  or the Treasury.  The Reserve Bank of 
Australia confirmed that it ha d intervened in cu rrency markets on August 16 in what it 
said was an effort to restore liquidity to the foreign exchange market, but did not disclose 
the size of the operation or the currenc ies in which it had intervened.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
On average, economic indicators received since the August Greenbook have softened.  
Second-quarter GDP growth slowed in most  advanced foreign economies, with the 
exception of the United Kingdom.  The step -down was most pronounced in Japan, where 
GDP contracted 1.2 percent at an annual rate, but was also substantia l in the euro area, 
where total domestic demand rose only about 0.5 percent (a.r.).  Although growth edged 
down to 3.4 percent in Canada, data late in th e quarter, including reta il sales, indicated a 
more significant weakening in ac tivity.  This softness appears to have continued into the 
third quarter in some economies.  In July, i ndicators in Europe generally have moderated 
on balance from their second-quarter levels; however those in Canada and Japan have 
slowed more notably.  Most of the readi ngs available on economic developments after 
August 9, when financial turmoil intensifie d, are measures of confidence.  These 
measures dropped on average, but they are othe rwise consistent with what was reported 
for July. 
 
Headline inflation in most of the advanced  foreign economies was close to 2 percent. 
Inflation rates held steady in Canada and th e euro area, whereas in the United Kingdom 
the twelve-month rate dropped to 1.9 percent in July.  In Japan, headli ne inflation was flat 
in July.  No major central bank raised its policy rate during the intermeeting period, 
although as discussed above, most major ce ntral banks provided extra liquidity to 
overnight money markets in response to th e recent turmoil in financial markets. 
 
In Japan , real GDP contracted 1.2 percent in the second quarter, after two quarters of 
robust expansion.  The declines in both public and private investment steepened 
markedly from the previous quarter.  Als o, consumption and export growth moved down 
noticeably, the latter bringing down the contribution from net exports substantially. 
 
Recent indicators of economic activity suggest that the economy continues to show some 
weakness.  Industrial production, industrial shipments, real house hold expenditures, and 
retail sales all fell in July.  Temporary fact ors appear to have played a role, as an 
earthquake in northern Japan disrupted auto mobile production and bad weather weakened 
spending.  However, the lackluster performa nce could also be more persistent since 
industrial production has now fallen in four of  the last five months.  Moreover, the 
continued decline in household earnings may also have contributed to weak consumer demand.

Notwithstanding the recent dec line in output, the labor market continues to improve, with 
the unemployment rate falling to 3.6 percent in July, the best reading since February 
1998.  The job offers-to-applicants ratio (the  number of officially posted job openings 
relative to the number of officially registered job seekers)  remained flat at 1.07, close to a 
fifteen-year high.  However, nomin al wages continued to fall. 
 
The nationwide core consumer price index (e xcluding fresh food only)  fell 0.1 percent in 
July from a year earlier, the sixth consecutive month of decline, and the second-quarter 
GDP deflator fell 0.2 percent from a year ago.  Meanwhile, the core CPI for Tokyo, a 
leading indicator of prices, remained unc hanged from a year earlier in August. 
 
On September 12, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe re signed citing a lack of  public trust that 
made it difficult to carry out government policie s.  His decision came as the Democratic 
Party of Japan opposed the passage of a law th at would allow Japan to continue providing 
logistical support to U.S. led operations in Afghanistan.  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced that it will hold an election on September 19 to choose the successor to Prime Minister Abe.  The LDP’s secretary general, Taro Aso, and former 
finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, are seen as possible contenders for the job.

Euro-area GDP growth for the second quarter slowed to 1.4 percent at an annual rate, 
down from 2.9 percent in the pr evious quarter.  The slowdow n was widespread across the 
major euro-area countries and owed primarily to a decline in fixed investment following 
two quarters of strong growth.  In additi on, a drawdown of inventories subtracted 
½ percentage point from GDP growth.  In  contrast, consumer spending rebounded after 
being flat in the first quarter  as a result of the German  VAT increase.  Net exports 
contributed ¾ percentage point to GDP growth as export growth picked up.

Other indicators of activity that had been relatively strong in the second quarter have 
moderated.  German industrial production wa s almost unchanged in July.  Euro-area 
manufacturing orders picked up sharply in June, though German orders plunged over 
7 percent in July.  The euro-area PMI for ma nufacturing declined from 54.9 in July to 
54.3 in August but was still above the threshold for expansion.  A number of business 
confidence measures, whose su rveys include at least some responses after August 9, 
moved lower, including the European Comm ission survey of euro-area industrial 
confidence, the German IFO business climate index, and the ZEW survey of German financial market participan ts.  The current conditions portions of these surveys

generally remained at a somewhat elevated leve l, even as the surveys of future prospects 
of activity weakened. 
 
Retail sales in the euro area ticked up 0.1 percent in July, matching their rise in the 
second quarter.  The euro-area unemployment ra te continued at 6.9 percent in July; the 
unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percen tage point over the past year.  Other 
indicators collected after the financial disr uptions intensified s how more moderation.  
The service sector PMI edged down in August, but remained above its level in the second 
quarter.  The European Commission survey of consumer sentiment declined fairly

Nonetheless, consumer sentiment is still well above its long-run average. 
 
Euro-area consumer prices inched up in August  from the previous month, according to 
the preliminary estimate.  The twelve-month increase in consumer prices was steady at

In the United Kingdom , real GDP growth increased to 3.4 percent in the second quarter.  
Private consumption grew 2.9 percent, up 1 pe rcentage point from the first quarter.  
Higher inventories added 1.8 percentage points to output growth.  Investment spending, 
which had been vigorous over the past two y ears, fell 4.3 percent.  Business investment 
remained strong, however, expanding 3.2 percen t, but government investment more than 
offset this as it returned to a moderate p ace after an exceptionally strong first quarter.

Recent data, including surveys that collected information partly after August 9, suggest 
that the economic expansion has continued at  a moderate pace in the third quarter.  
Consumer confidence reached a two-year high in August, in part as households’ 
expectations about their ability  to save improved.  Retailers reported that total sales rose 
about 4 percent in August from a year earlier.   Business confidence firmed in August but, 
having plunged in July, remained well below its average over the first half of 2007.  
Among consumer services firms, optimism a bout the business situation tumbled in the 
third quarter.  Nevertheless, the PMI for serv ices stayed elevated in August, and the PMI 
for manufacturing and construction were at  their highest leve ls since 1994 and 1998, 
respectively. 
 
The claimant count measure of the unempl oyment rate edged down to 2.6 percent in 
August, matching a thirty-year low achiev ed in late 2004 and early 2005.  The Labor 
Force Survey measure of the unemployment ra te was unchanged at 5.4 percent in July.  
Average earnings including bonuses grew 3.8 per cent in the twelve months to July, while 
unit wage costs in the manufacturing sect or rose 0.8 percent over that period. 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation fell sharply in July, dipping to 
1.9 percent.  It was the first time since March 2006 that the headlin e inflation was below 
the Bank of England's target of 2 percent.   Core inflation, which excludes energy and 
unprocessed food, also fell to 1.9 percent.  Food products, household furniture, natural 
gas and electricity services ma de the largest contributions to  the deceleration in inflation. 
 
In Canada,  real GDP growth edged down to a still -robust pace of 3.4 per cent (a.r.) in the 
second quarter.  Personal consumption expenditu re rose 4.9 percent, fuelled by gains in 
income.  After falling in the first quart er, business investment in machinery and 
equipment rebounded in the second quarter.  Exports of goods and services increased 
2.9 percent as exports of energy products surged.  Exports of manufactured goods 
registered mixed results as automotive pr oduct exports plummeted and industrial goods 
and materials bounced back following a declin e in the first quarter.  Imports also 
increased rapidly, resulting in an overa ll negative net e xport contribution.

The second quarter ended on a weak note, and da ta for the third quarter are sparse.  While 
consumer spending was strong in the second qua rter, the trajectory coming into the third 
quarter is slower, as retail sa les fell 0.6 percent in June.  Real manufacturing shipments 
fell 1.7 percent in June suggesting continued weakness in business fixed investment, and 
the manufacturing PMI remains below its sec ond-quarter level despite recovering some 
in August.  After sliding 4 percent in both June and Ju ly, housing starts recovered 
5 percent in August.  The nominal surplus of merchandise trade narrowed further in July.  
Although real exports improved from a dip in June, real imports  rose 4 percent. 
 
In August, employment growth increased sli ghtly from its subdued July pace.  Unusually 
large increases in public-sector  and education services acco unted for most of the August 
increase.  Education services had experienced  a larger-than-normal decline in July.  
Despite the August pickup, employment gains are still well below th e pace of the first 
half of 2007.  The unemployment rate remained  unchanged at its thir ty-three-year low of 
6 percent in August.  Twelve-month wage inflation increased to 4 percent from 
3.8 percent in July. 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price infla tion remained at 2.2 percent (n.s.a.) in July 
for the fourth consecutive month.  Core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile 
components and the effects of changes in indi rect taxes, ticked down to 2.3 percent in 
July from 2.5 percent in June.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Data through July, before the recent financia l market volatility, suggest that economic 
activity in emerging market c ountries remained robust.  Ou tput in the Asian economies 
soared in the second quarter, with severa l countries posting at or near double-digit 
growth.  In Latin America, Mexican a nd Venezuelan output rebounded sharply from 
earlier weakness.  Chinese indicators for July  point to only a mode st slowing of output 
growth from its red-hot pace in the first half of this year.  The scan t August data received 
thus far provide little indication that the turmoil in financia l markets has had a significant 
negative impact on real economic activity in emerging market economies.  Data for the 
third quarter show some pickup in inflation, in part related to further increases in food 
prices. 
 
In China , incoming data point to some modera tion of economic activity in the third 
quarter.  Industrial production fell in July on a seasonally-ad justed basis, and there was a 
significant deceleration of exports (s.a.) in July and August, which has contributed to a 
narrowing of the trade surplus.  The slower e xport growth was expect ed, as its strength in 
prior months had reflected a pulling forward of  shipments ahead of cuts in value-added 
tax rebates on many exports effective July 1.  Fixed investment for the twelve months 
ending in July posted a strong in crease of 26½ percent, but th is was slightly lower than 
the pace seen in recent months. 
 
Consumer prices continued to accelerate in July and August, with twelve-month increases 
of about 5½ and 6½ percent, respectively.  As in recent months, the acceleration in prices 
can be explained entirely by a runup in prices  of food.  In addition to the hog-disease 
cycle, which is still playing out, floods in pa rts of China are also pushing up food prices.  
While non-food price inflation remains low, at  less than 1 percent, concerns about food 
price increases spilli ng into non-food prices have inte nsified, as money growth has 
picked up significantly to 18½ percent for the twelve months ending in July.  As 
expected, Chinese authorities undertook anothe r round of monetary policy tightening in 
August, raising the benchmark one-year bank le nding rate 18 basis points to 7.02 percent.  
The increase in inflation pushed real deposit rates further into negative territory.  In 
response, the Chinese government raised th e benchmark one-year deposit rate 27 basis 
points to 3.6 percent and the reserve require ment ratio 50 basis points to 12.5 percent.

In a small but important step toward capital account liberaliz ation in late August, China’s 
State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced a pilot program giving permission 
to some individual investors in China to ma ke overseas investments in Hong Kong-listed 
securities.  Under the program, such inve stments can be done only by opening an account 
with a Bank of China (BOC) br anch that has an agency arrangement with BOC’s Tianjin 
branch.  If the program, which has yet to implemented, becomes mo re widespread and 
investments are also allowed in other inte rnational markets, it has the potential to 
somewhat ease pressure on the renminbi to ap preciate.  Anticipation of investments from 
mainland China led to a rally in the H-shares  (Chinese enterprises)  index of Hong Kong's 
market.

In Hong Kong, real GDP jumped 8.2 percent in the second quarter following below-
trend growth in the first quarter.  Domestic  demand surged, with private consumption and 
fixed investment both up sharply.  The unemp loyment rate has continued to trend lower 
and in July fell to its lowest level sin ce 1998.  In addition, the volume of exports and 
imports in July grew 8 and 9 percent (re lative to a year earl ier), respectively.  
Twelve-month inflation remained well under 2 percent in July as a result of a rent 
concession on public housing, which is scheduled to expire in October, but inflation has 
been trending upward over the past few months.

In Taiwan , output growth rebounded to 7.6 percent in the second quarter from a first-
quarter trough.  After contracting in the firs t quarter, industrial production jumped nearly 
8 percent in the second quarter and surged in  July.  The unemployment rate remained at 
3.9 percent in July, and the healthy la bor market has helped support domestic 
consumption.  In addition, trade data thus far in the third quarter have shown strong 
growth in exports, particularly in August.  Although twelve-month consumer price 
inflation was near zero in the second quarter and July, prices rose 1.6 percent in August.  
Typhoons destroyed crops, which boosted food prices, and clothing prices increased.

Major economic indicators for  Korea  have remained strong so far in the third quarter.  
Industrial production jumped 2.1 percent in July, supported by surging high-tech 
production.  Korea’s merchandise  trade balance was sizable in July, and the current 
account balance recovered further.  Trade in dicators for August also show continued 
strength.  In addition, July serv ice activity and retail sales al so strengthened.  Despite the 
recent financial market turmoil, August meas ures of business and consumer confidence, 
remained elevated.  Consumer price inflation dropped to 2 per cent over the twelve 
months ended August, reflecting lower energy an d food prices.  Inflation has held at or 
below the lower bound of the Bank of Korea’ s 2.5 to 3.5 percent target range; however, 
sharp increases in lending by financial institutions led the Bank to tighten the target 
interest rate for the second consecutive month in August to 5 percent.  The Bank of Korea 
held rates steady at its September meeting.  Broad money growth slowed slightly to 10 percent in July.

In India, output rose nearly 10 percent in the second quarter after a double-digit gain the 
quarter earlier.  Agriculture and construc tion output fell back after previous sharp 
increases, but manufacturing production contin ued to surge and service sector output 
remained robust.  The trade deficit, whic h had widened considerably in the second 
quarter, narrowed somewhat in July as imports shrank and exports expanded.  FDI 
inflows soared in the second quarter; and while  foreign investors withdrew from the stock 
market in early August, equity prices have almost recovered to their late July peak.  Thus far in the third quarter, twelve-month infla tion of both the CPI and the more closely 
watched wholesale price index have been be low their second-quarter levels, in part 
IV-35 
reflecting earlier administrative measures to  lower prices of selected imported goods 
including fuels.  In August, key domestic and foreign lenders in India announced that an 
Indian credit bureau to evaluate individual borrowers will be operational in November, 
and the Reserve Bank of India announced  it would launch an electronic reporting 
platform for derivative products starting at the end of August.

Across the ASEAN  region, activity continued to expand at a strong pace in the second 
quarter.  Real GDP soared over 14 percent in Singapore, buoyed by the volatile 
biomedical sector, and rose strongly elsewhere in the re gion as well.  Growth was 
generally driven by domestic demand, notably private consumption.  In July, industrial 
production in Singapore rose sharply following a large contra ction the previous month, 
and Thailand followed the same pattern but with a much smaller swing.  In Malaysia, 
industrial production contracted  for the second consecutive month in July following 
strong growth in May.  Trade balances in th e region were generall y strong except in 
Thailand, where the closure of plants for maintenance contributed to a pronounced 
narrowing of the surplus.  Twelve-month consum er price inflation generally has risen in 
recent months across the region, owing mostly  to higher food and/or energy prices.  A 
two percentage-point increase in the goods and services ta x in Singapore further boosted 
July inflation.  In Thailand, however, the rapi d appreciation of the baht and lackluster 
domestic demand continued to push inflation lower.  On August 19, a majority of Thai 
voters approved a referendum on a new consti tution.  The adoption of the constitution 
sets the stage for general elections on D ecember 23; a military government has been in 
power since the coup in September 2006.

In Mexico , real GDP growth rebounded to 5.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter 
from the weak first quarter, mainly on th e strength of agriculture and services, 
particularly transportation.  Industrial production, which contracted in the first quarter, 
grew only 1.3 percent in the second as performance in the manufacturing sector remained 
subdued.  Mexico’s consumer confidence index rose in August to its highest level this 
year, but it is unclear the exte nt to which the timing of the survey allowed consumer’s 
reaction to the recent financial mark et turmoil to be incorporated. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation continued to  hover around 4 percent in July and August, 
driven by increases in agricultural prices.  Twelve-month core inflation edged up to 
3.9 percent.  Headline infla tion has remained around the upper limit of the Bank of 
Mexico's 2-to-4 percent target range for a ye ar.  Nonetheless, as it has since April, the 
central bank decided during its  late-August meeting not to tighten monetary policy under 
the expectation that inflation will fall back within the target range  soon.  Once again, the 
central bank signaled a further tightening of  policy might occur if inflation does not 
recede as expected.

In Brazil , second-quarter real GDP growth (data r eceived too late to incorporate into the 
forecast and tables of Part 1) slowed to 3.2 percent, as a moderation in services growth 
more than offset a pickup in industria l production.  In July, however, industrial 
IV-41 
production fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by d eclines in producti on of capital and 
intermediate goods.  The trade su rplus has narrowed thus far in the third quarter.  Imports 
in July and August grew 31 percent relative to the same period last year, while exports 
rose 7 percent.  Inflation jumped in August, bringing twelve-month inflation to 
4.3 percent, up from about 3 percen t early this year.  The rise in  inflation reflects a rise in 
food prices, but other categories also saw increases. 
 
On September 5, the central bank reduced its policy rate ¼ percentage point to 
11.25 percent, down 8½ percentage points since the current easing phase began in late 
2005.  The move marks a more gradual approach  relative to the 50 basis-point reductions 
at the two previous meetings.  The smaller cut appears to be  in response to inflationary 
pressures from both soaring food pr ices and strong domestic demand.

In Argentina, the Index of Economic Activity (a monthly proxy of GDP) through June 
suggests that growth was strong in the sec ond quarter.  Argentine industrial production 
increased 1.5 percent in the second quarter, pr imarily due to growth in the motor vehicles 
sector.  However, industrial production fell for the second consecutive month in July and 
the trade surplus narrowed.  Twelve-month cons umer price inflation remained elevated in 
July and August, partly reflecting a combined  run-up in fiscal sp ending related to the 
October presidential election a nd an increase in food prices.

Petroleum output partially rebounded from its 5 percent decline in the first quarter and 
rose by about 3 percent, while non-petroleum out put rose 11 percent.  Inflation continues 
to be extremely high, but edged down to ar ound 16 percent in August on a twelve-month 
basis.  In mid-August, the Chavez government unveiled a constitutional reform proposal 
that entails, among other things, the removal of presidential term limits and the central bank’s legal autonomy.  A referendum on the pr oposal is expected in December.  In

disinflation process.  On August 28, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was formally elected 
the next President of Turkey.
