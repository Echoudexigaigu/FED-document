II-1 Overall economic activity appears to have advan ced at a solid pace in the third quarter.  
Despite the turbulence in credit markets and the further deteri oration in the housing 
market, consumer outlays picked up after pos ting a weak showing in the second quarter, 
and business outlays for both equipment and stru ctures seem to have remained reasonably 
strong.  In particular, consumer goods sp ending was well maintained in August and 
September, and orders and shipments for cap ital goods trended up through August.  The 
one notable locus of weakness was in resi dential investment, where the ongoing slump 
intensified, at least partly because of problems in nonconforming mortgage markets.  In 
the labor market, private payroll growth decel erated from its first-half pace.  After 
registering elevated rates during the first half  of the year, top-line inflation eased over the 
past several months because of falling ener gy prices; core inflation continued to be 
moderate. 
Labor Market Developments 
Employment decelerated in the third quarter.  Private payrolls increased at an average 
monthly rate of 74,000, about 40,000 per month less than in the first ha lf of the year.  
Employment in residential construction, manufacturing, and industries related to 
mortgage lending continued to decline, whereas  most service industr ies added jobs at a 
moderate pace.  With employment growth slowing and the workweek flat, aggregate 
hours of private production and nonsupervisory workers increased at an annual rate of 
1.2 percent in the third quarter, down from th e 2.1 pace recorded in the previous quarter.1 
On balance, other indicators  of labor demand do not suggest  as much softening as is 
indicated by the payroll survey.  The pace of la yoffs appears to have held steady thus far, 
according to such indicators as initial claims for unemployment insurance, layoffs as reported in the JOLT survey, layoff announcemen ts as compiled from press reports, and 
the short-term job losers rate from the hous ehold survey.  Indicat ors of hiring—hires as 
reported in the JOLT survey and hiring plans in surveys by Manpower and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) —have stepped down recently but remain  
                                                
 
1 With the September employment report, the Bure au of Labor Statistics announced its preliminary 
estimate of the annual benchmark revision that will be published with the January 2008 employment report.  
For March 2007, the preliminary benchmark revision for total private employment is -217,000 
(-0.2 percentage point).  By industry, the largest down ward revisions are expected in manufacturing, leisure 
and hospitality, and financial activities.  Construction employment is expected to be virtually unrevised (-8,000).  Thus, the surprising resilience of reported pa yrolls in the construction sector in the face of the 
sharp downturn in residential construction activity is not expected to be revised away by the upcoming benchmark.  The downward revision to private employment growth implies that, to a first approximation, 
productivity growth over the four quarters ending in 2007:Q1 will be revised up 0.2 percentage point, to 
about 0.6 percent.

at healthy levels.  Measures of labor market  tightness—the share of firms reporting to the 
NFIB that they had a hard-to-fill position a nd households’ assessments of job availability 
according to the Conference Board—suggest that little has changed in the balance 
between supply and demand since the beginning of 2007. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point in 
September to 4.7 percent, and the labor fo rce participation rate bounced back to 
66.0 percent following a drop in August.  The movements in the participation rate in 
August and September were probably due to th e late date of the August survey this 
year—late enough for a larger-than-normal numb er of students to have already headed 
back to school. 
Industrial Production  
After solid advances in June and July, industr ial production (IP) change d little in August 
and September.  Manufacturing output fell back 0.4 percent in August and edged up 
0.1 percent in September but, on the strength of large increases in June and July, rose at 
an annual rate of about 4 percent for the th ird quarter as a whole.  This advance was 
about the same as in the second quarter, as  greater strength in high-technology industries 
offset weakness in motor vehicles and parts.   Overall, manufacturing production appears 
poised for modest gains in the near term , although the decline in homebuilding will 
continue to be a drag on output of construction s upplies and products. 
In September, production of light motor vehicles tumbled 600,000 units to an annual rate 
of 10.1 million units.  About half of the decline reflected losses  from a two-day strike at 
General Motors.2  For the third quarter as a whol e, light vehicle production averaged 
10.6 million units (annual rate), down a bit from  the second-quarter pace but still well 
above the assembly rates recorded earlier this  year.  Inventories of light vehicles fell 
sharply in September, but inve ntories appear to remain above  desired levels at Chrysler 
and Ford.  Plans for the fourth quarter call for assemblies at a rate of 10.1 million units.  
Elsewhere in transportation equipment, Boei ng recently announced it would delay by six 
months its initial deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, which should damp production during 
the first half of 2008. 
High-technology output decelerated in Augus t and September, but overall the third 
quarter came in with an above-average gain of  nearly 30 percent at an annual rate.  The 
first half of 2007 witn essed a surge in computer production resulting from demand for  
                                                 
2 The staff estimates that GM lost 310,000 units (annual rate) in Sept ember because of the strike.  The 
brief strike at Chrysler appears to have had no significant effect on production.

high-end servers and computers capable of running Microsoft’s newest operating system.  
In the third quarter, preliminary data from Gartner indicate that unit sales of servers 
increased, but unit sales of personal computers fell slightly, held back by lower consumer 
demand.  Output of communications equipment continued to rise at a healthy pace in 
September. 
After a surge in June and July, semic onductor production decelerated in August and 
edged down in September, as downstream de mand at manufacturers of PCs and cell 
phones slowed.  Intel’s revenue guidance dipped for the fourth quarter, consistent with a 
slight pullback in the output  of MPUs.  Meanwhile, domestic production of circuit boards 
has risen in recent months, and the book-to-bil l ratio for this industry has been above 1 
for most of the year, pointing to further gains in production of high-end equipment in 
coming months.  Among other near-term i ndicators, the National Association for 
Business Economics (NABE) survey of business plans for spending on high-tech 
equipment over the next 12 months deteriorat ed in the third quarter, suggesting that 
future capital spending plans for high-tec hnology products may be damped some by the 
current financial stress, especially in the fi nance, insurance, and real estate category.3 
Excluding the production of energy, motor vehi cles and parts, and high-tech products, 
manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent in Septem ber, nearly reversing a drop in August.  
Increases in production of medical equipmen t and business supplies were particularly 
strong in September.  In contrast, the inde x for construction supplies declined for the 
third consecutive month, after increasing br iskly during the second quarter when the 
output of products associated with nonresiden tial construction posted large increases.  
The recent weakness in construction supplies was widespread and likely driven by the 
ongoing plunge in residential investment.  Production of both durable and nondurable 
materials rose in September, but the level of production was littl e changed from July. 
Looking forward, a subdued pace of motor vehicle assemblies and the ongoing 
contraction in residential construction will li kely prove a drag on the output of a variety 
of materials-related i ndustries, such as primary metals , plastics, and rubber products.  
Some weakness is already evident, as th e three-month IP diffusion index has moved 
down for two consecutive months.  The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) new orders diffusion index also moved down in September, and the New York and 
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Banks’ new orders  indexes were mixed in October.  All 
three indexes, however, remain consistent with continued modest gains in the near term.

Foreign demand has continued to support manuf acturing output, and the ratio of exports 
to shipments remained on its upward trajectory in August.  Last, few inventory overhangs 
are apparent, and the inventory-shipments ra tio derived from the staff’s flow-of-goods 
system continues to trend downward. 
Motor Vehicles  
After having slowed in June and July, de mand for motor vehicles has rebounded more 
recently despite little change in overall incentive spending; automobiles and light trucks 
sold at an annual rate of 16.2 million units in both August and September.  Over the first 
20 days of October, unit sales of the major Japanese nameplates—which represent more 
than one-third of total sale s—were running only a bit below their brisk September rate.  
To date, the recent turbulence in credit markets does not appear to be disrupting motor vehicle financing or sales. 
The Reuters/Michigan index of car-buying conditions moved down in early October but 
remains well above the recent lows that were seen from May through July, when households were particularly conc erned about gasoline prices.   
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending has been well maintained ov er the past few months.  In addition to 
the aforementioned improvement in motor vehi cle sales in August and September, real 
spending on other goods posted solid gains in bo th months.  Real outlays for consumer 
services rose a strong 0.6 percen t in August (the latest availabl e data), in part because of 
an estimated rise in spending on brokerage services and a weather-induced jump in 
energy services; services spending likely mode rated in September as the weather turned 
more seasonable.  All told, we estimate that to tal real PCE increased at an annual rate of 
about 3¼ percent in the third quarter. 
Gains in real income were robust over the summer, the result of solid increases in 
nominal wages and salaries and very low head line inflation.  Furthermore, the latest 
readings on average hourly earni ngs and prices point to stro ng gains in real wages and 
salaries in September.   
Other factors affecting consumer spending ha ve been mixed.  The recent drop in short-
term interest rates should help boost spendi ng by bolstering househol ds’ expectations for 
future economic growth and perhaps by lowe ring borrowing costs, and the stock market 
has risen, on balance, since August.  However,  house prices have continued to decelerate, 
and the turmoil in financial markets that bega n in August is likely exerting some restraint 
on consumer spending; since mid-summer, st andards on consumer and mortgage credit

have tightened.  In addition, consumer  confidence, as measured by both the 
Reuters/Michigan and the Conference Board su rveys, is down relative to readings from 
July despite the recent goods news on inflation, the labor market, and stock prices.   
With real income having risen somewhat mo re slowly than real PCE in August, the 
saving rate edged down to 0.7 percent.  Mo re generally, however, the saving rate has 
been rising from the low levels of the summer of 2006. 
Housing  
As was anticipated, the housing downturn appe ars to be deepening.  Sales of existing 
single-family homes dropped a cumulative 12½ percent during August and September, 
and new home sales slid 8¼ percen t in August (not at annual rates).  Th e deterioration in 
nonprime mortgage markets and the higher rate s and tighter lending conditions for prime-
rate jumbo loans have exacerbated the wo rsening conditions in housing markets.  
Nonprime mortgage originations (which incl ude the subprime and alt-A categories) have 
slowed to a trickle since mi d-summer, and, although spreads between rates for prime-rate 
jumbo and conforming thirty-year fixed-rate  mortgages have narrowed a bit in recent 
weeks, they are still 40 basis points wider than the 25 basis poi nt spread that prevailed on 
average since 2001.  Moreover, even though rates for thirty-y ear fixed-rate conforming 
mortgages have moved down of late, they are still about 20 basi s points above their 
average level over the first f our months of this year.  
Other indicators point to a further slowi ng in housing demand in the near term.  The 
index of pending sales agreements—which tends  to lead sales of single-family existing 
homes by one to two months—slid 6½ percent in  August on the heels of July’s decline of 
11 percent.4  In these two months, pending sales we re down in all regions of the country, 
with the largest cumulative declines in th e West and Northeast—regions where average 
home prices are higher and where nonconforming mortgages tend to be more prevalent.  
 
  
 
                                                 
4 On a contrary note, the four-week moving average of the Mortgage Bankers Association’s mortgage 
purchase index (not shown) still stands well above its mi d-April level.  However, this net increase is likely 
misleading for two reasons.  First, the purchase index does not sample loan applications taken by mortgage 
brokers, who issue the overwhelming majority of nonprime loans.  Second, the index measures mortgage applications rather than approvals; because mortgage lending standards have tightened this year for many 
borrowers, a smaller proportion of these applications are likely to have been approved than previously, and some borrowers may be applying to more lenders for a given loan.

Indeed, anecdotes from many builders suggest that a lack of buyer confidence will 
significantly restrain new housing de mand for the rest of this year. 
After having held production r oughly steady over the first half of this year, homebuilders 
are once again making significant cuts.  In September, single-family housing starts 
moved down another 1¾ percent, to an a nnual rate of 963,000 units , after declining a 
cumulative 15 percent during July and Augus t.  Meanwhile, adjusted single-family 
permit issuance—generally a useful indicator of future starts—continued along the steep 
downward trajectory that bega n about two years ago.  Yet, because of sagging sales, 
builders are making only limited progress at pa ring down their bloated inventories.  In 
August, the months’ supply of unsold ne w homes remained at about 8 months, 
approximately 65 percent above the upper end of  the fairly tight range it had occupied 
between 1997 and the summer of 2005.   
 
 
 
 
.  Mu ltifamily starts declined sharply in 
September, but the third-quarter reading rema ined within the fairly narrow range in 
which this series has fluctuat ed over the past ten years.  
Little new information on house prices has become available since the time of the September Greenbook.  The latest-available read ing for the purchase-only version of the 
repeat-sales price index calcula ted by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
(OFHEO) shows that prices were 2¾ percen t higher in the second quarter than a year 
earlier, well below the 8¼ per cent increase posted over the pr eceding four-quarter period.  
The ten-city version of the Ca se-Shiller repeat-sales price index—which is more heavily 
concentrated in urban areas that had seen la rger appreciations in earlier years—shows an 
outright decline of 4½ percent over the twelve-month period ending in July.  The average

measures but often reflects shifts in the mi x of homes sold—fell in  September relative to 
year-earlier readings.  Average new-home prices had held up fairly well through much of 
the current downturn, but they plunged in August relative to their year-e arlier level.  The 
decline is consistent with mounting anecdot al evidence that many large homebuilders are 
resorting to price discounts, rather than nonprice incentives,  to bolster sales and unload 
inventory. 
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) appears to have increased at a solid 
pace in the third quarter.  Orders and ship ments of nondefense capital goods excluding 
aircraft increased, on average, over July and August.  In addition, the drag from falling business purchases of motor vehicles has dissipated.  However, anecdotal evidence 
suggests that this summer’s financial market  turbulence may be restraining spending in 
some industries. 
The fundamental determinants of business in vestment have been mixed.  Business output 
has decelerated over the past year.  However, the user cost of capital continued to trend 
down through the second quarter, and corporate ca sh flow remained at an elevated level 
relative to corporate fixed investment.  In th e summer, financing costs increased amid the 
turmoil in corporate credit markets, especia lly for lower-grade borrowers, but these costs 
receded somewhat in early September.  Surv eys of business conditions, such as the ISM 
and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing diffusi on indexes and the NABE survey, remain 
consistent with further near-term gains in spending.  However, according to firms 
contacted by Reserve Banks as part of thei r Beige Book inquiries, about 20 percent of 
businesses have revised down their plans for cap ital spending over the next six to twelve 
months—and about 7 percent have revised up their capital spending plans—in response 
to the recent changes in financial conditions.  Based on our own discussions with industry contacts and on the third-quarter NABE surve y, some of this revi sion to spending plans 
appears to be at financial firms, which purchase a good deal of high-tech equipment. 
Business spending for the broad category of  equipment outside of high-tech and 
transportation likely increased at a solid rate  in the third quarter.  Although shipments 
were flat and orders declined in August, th e robust gains in the preceding month left the 
average value of shipments and orders in the first two months of the third quarter above 
the second-quarter average.

II-23 
In the high-tech sector, real business spending on computers and peripherals appears to 
have risen at a moderate pace in the thir d quarter.  Although industrial production of 
computers slowed in the third quarter, output for the business market appears to have posted a solid gain.  In contrast, busine ss outlays on communications equipment likely 
rose at a subpar pace in the third quarter, as the fraction of shipments going overseas seems to have risen. 
After tumbling sharply over the first half of this year, sales of medium and heavy trucks 
leveled off in the third quarter at an av erage annual rate of  about 325,000 units per 
month.  The earlier weakness was largely due to payback for purchases pulled forward by 
the change in engine emissions standards fo r heavy trucks, but this payback appears to 
have run its course, and the current levels  likely reflect a lower underlying pace of 
demand.   
.  Domestic 
outlays on aircraft have likely stepped down so mewhat in the third quarter, with sales to 
foreign airlines accounting for a higher sh are of domestic aircraft shipments.  
Nonresidential Construction  
Available data through August show that nonr esidential building ac tivity has remained 
vigorous on the heels of the sizzling 20 percen t (annual rate) spending gain posted in the 
second quarter.  The nonfinancial fundamentals for this sector remain solid, with vacancy 
rates remaining below their cyclical peaks de spite having edged up in recent quarters.  
Although the recent turbulence in commercial credit markets has somewhat clouded the 
outlook, anecdotes from general contractors through early October suggest that these 
developments have done little to slow the pace of  commercial constructi on thus far.  That 
said, the three-month moving average of the architectural billings index—which is 
reasonably well correlated with construc tion spending six months hence—has come 
down noticeably in recent months, hinting that financial turmoil may be hindering 
construction plans to some extent. 
Activity in the drilling and mini ng sector remains at a high le vel but does not seem to be 
increasing as rapidly as previ ously.  Available data through early October show that the 
number of rigs drilling for natural gas or cr ude oil has moved up little, on balance, so far 
this year after four years of robust increases.  Measures of footage drilled from the 
Department of Energy through September (not shown) show modest gains in recent

months.6  Looking forward, anecdotes in the Beige Book have improved somewhat of 
late but suggest that chronic shortages of equipment and key services are boosting costs 
and restraining new activity.  Incentives for further expansion of natural gas drilling—
which has propelled much of the recent growth  in this sector—also seem to have been 
damped by lower prices and persistently elevated inventories of natural gas. 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory invest ment excluding motor vehicles  increased at a moderate 
annual rate of $11 billion in the second quarter , and the book-value data in hand suggest a 
small liquidation over the first two months of the third quar ter.  The ratio of book-value 
inventories to sales in the manufacturing and trade sector  excluding motor vehicles in 
August remained at a level well below the el evated values seen around the turn of the 
year.  Information from the staff’s flow-of- goods system suggests that months’ supply of 
inventories excluding motor vehicles has b een little changed fo r several months.  
Purchasing managers, on average, viewed the level of their custom er’s inventories as 
about right in September, as the ISM cu stomers’ inventories index ticked up to 50. 
Federal Government Sector 
The federal unified budget deficit, which sh runk noticeably early in  fiscal year 2007, has 
leveled off over the past six months as th e rate of growth of  receipts has slowed 
markedly.  The Treasury reported an unadjuste d deficit of $163 billion for fiscal 2007, 
which ended in September.  The deficit adju sted for payment timing shifts and financial 
transactions was $181 billion, or approximately 1¼ percent of GDP, down from 2 percent 
of GDP a year earlier.7  
Receipts in the third quarter in creased just 3¼ percent relative to their year-earlier level, 
about half the pace seen for the fiscal year as a whole.  The slowdown was mostly due to 
a decline of 12 percent in corporate income ta x collections relative to their level a year 
earlier, probably reflecting weaker gains in pr ofits as well as volatili ty in the timing of 
payments.  By contrast, wit hheld income and payroll taxe s in the third quarter rose 
6½ percent above their year -earlier level, close to the rate of increase for the fiscal year as 
a whole. 
                                                 
6 The BEA reported that spending on drilling and mi ning structures jumped at an annual rate of 
49 percent in the second quarter, an estimate that is difficult to reconcile with the data cited above for the number of rigs in operation and footage drilled.  Ou r analysis of the historical data suggests that 
unexplained increases in the level of spending of this na ture tend to be reversed, in fairly short order, over 
subsequent quarters. 
7 The adjusted measure is larger than the unadjus ted one primarily because it excludes the proceeds 
from sales of the electromagnetic spectrum, which held down the actual (unadjusted) deficit.

Outlays (adjusted for payment timing shifts a nd financial transactions) rose 4¼ percent in 
the third quarter compared with their year- earlier level.  Defense spending increased a 
brisk 8½ percent relative to the same period a ye ar earlier.  These data suggest that real 
NIPA defense purchases in the third quarter  will be substantia lly above their second 
quarter level.  Outlays for the major transf er programs posted an increase of 6¼ percent 
from a year ago, in line with the pace seen ove r the fiscal year.  For the fiscal year as a 
whole, total outlays increased  only 3 percent (year over year), the slowest pace since the 
late 1990s, as payments for certain program s (disaster relief expe nditures, ag riculture 
subsidy payments, and student loan subsidies) that were temporarily elevated in fiscal 
2006 returned to more normal levels in 2007.   
Little progress has been made in comp leting the fiscal 2008 budget.  A continuing 
resolution is funding the fe deral government through November 16 while the Congress 
continues to work on the annual appropriations  bills.  The House ha s passed all twelve 
regular appropriations bills, and the Senate has passed seven that cover 90 percent of 
discretionary spending, but none of them have yet been enacted. 
State and Local Government Sector  
The incoming data point to a moderate increas e in real state and local purchases in the 
third quarter.  As we had thought likely, th e most recent labor market report contained 
sizable upward revisions to the previously  published figures for state and local 
employment in July and August, and empl oyment increased sharply in September.8  As a 
result, employment is now estimated to ha ve risen 23,000 per month, on average, over the 
three months ending in September, similar to the pace recorded over th e first half of the 
year.  Meanwhile, real constr uction spending appears to have  moved up further in July 
and August (the latest availabl e data) after increasing substa ntially in the first half.   
On the whole, state and local revenue fl ows have held up reasonably well of late, 
although recent gains have been much smaller than those recorded over the preceding two years.  According to the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local 
Government Tax Revenue, state revenues during the year ending in June—fiscal year 
2007 for most states—were 5 percent above their year-earlier le vel; individual and 
corporate income taxes posted solid—albeit  unspectacular—gains ove r this period, and  
                                                
 
8 Most of the upward revision was in local education employment, which had previously been reported 
to have declined a startling 82,000 between June and Au gust, but was revised up to show a small increase, 
on net, over the two months.  As the BLS noted in the Acting Commissioner’s statement on October 5, initial estimates of employment in local education typi cally are based upon a smaller percentage of survey 
responses than in other sectors, which can make estimation problematic in months when school sessions 
begin and end.

sales tax collections rose just  4 percent, held down in part by softness in purchases of 
building materials and supplies and other housin g-related items.  At the local level, 
revenues rose 6½ percent during the year endi ng in June as property taxes apparently 
continued to be bolstered by the lagged effects of earlier increa ses in real estate values.  
Prices 
After having risen rapidly in the first ha lf of the year, headline consumer prices 
decelerated considerably this summer, larg ely due to a fall in energy prices.  In 
September, the overall CPI increased 0.3 per cent after almost no ch ange in July and 
August.  These readings brought  the annual rate of increase in the headline CPI down to 
1 percent over the th ree months ending in September,  well below the 5 percent rate 
posted in the first half of the year.   Core  consumer price inflation continued to be 
moderate in August and September and, on a twelve-month change basis, is down 
noticeably from a year earlier.  Survey measur es of inflation expect ations edged down in 
September and early October; however, m easures based on TIPS have edged up a bit 
over this period. 
Energy prices increased 0.3 percent in Sept ember after having fallen in each of the 
previous three months.  Gasoline prices incr eased only slightly in September, despite a 
jump in crude oil costs, and app ear to have risen only modestly  so far in October as well.  
As a result, the margin between the retail pr ice of gasoline and crude  oil costs, which had 
reached record highs last spring, has declined to relatively low levels in recent weeks, 
even though inventories remain near the low end of their normal range.  
Consumer food prices posted further sizable  increases in August and September and 
continue to run well above the change in core prices.  These elevated rates of inflation in 
food prices reflect, in part, the ongoing pass- through of high corn prices, which have 
been boosted by the strong demand for ethanol.  Retail prices for chicken and milk have 
continued to rise appreciably in  recent months, and egg prices  have soared.  In contrast, 
beef prices have leveled out, and pork prices have turned down.  In addition, rising prices 
for other grains, most noticeably wheat and soybeans—the output of which was reduced 
by adverse weather and the shift in acreag e to corn production—have shown through to 
higher retail prices for products such as cereal  and bakery products.  Finally, other price 
increases—notably for food away from home—h ave remained elevated.  In spot markets 
for crops, corn prices have moved up somewhat since the September Greenbook but 
remain well below their peak reached earlier th is year, whereas prices for wheat appear to 
have stabilized in recen t weeks near their record high.  Spot  prices for steers and chickens

have moved down a bit since the Sept ember Greenbook, whereas hog prices have 
dropped sharply.  
In September, the CPI excluding food a nd energy rose 0.2 percent for the fourth 
consecutive month.  On the basis of the CP I and PPI data, we estimate that core PCE 
prices also rose 0.2 percent in September,  following smaller increases in each of the 
previous six months.   
Over the last six months, core PCE price in flation (at a 1.6 percent rate) has been running 
well below core CPI inflation (at a 2.4 percent rate).  In contrast, both core price indexes 
had increased at a 1.9 percent annual rate over the previous six-month period.  The 
¾ percentage point gap between core CPI infl ation and core PCE inflation over the most 
recent six months is unusually large, and we continue to view the recent low readings on 
PCE price inflation as partly transitory.  The recent relative softness in PCE price 
inflation reflects, in part, below-average rate s of nonmarket price inflation; because these 
price changes tend to be mean reverting, we e xpect this factor to diminish over time.  
Beyond that, differences in the weights used in  the two indexes have  contributed to the 
divergent movements, as has the fact that th e PPI measures of medical services prices 
used in the PCE price index have increased by much less than have the equivalent CPI 
measures.  Large gaps between the CPI and PC E measures of core in flation typically do 
not persist; however, outside of the nonmarket segment, hi story does not provide a strong 
indication of which measure will move to narrow the gap.

Taking a longer view, both the core CPI and core PCE indexes have decelerated over the 
most recent twelve months compared with the similar period twelve months earlier.  As 
already noted, below-average increases in th e nonmarket components of PCE have held 
down core PCE inflation this year, but market-based core PCE prices have decelerated markedly over the past year as well.  Core goods prices have fallen about 1 percent over 
the past year after rising little over the preced ing year (with noticeable decelerations in

the prices of apparel, prescription drugs, and motor vehicles).  In addition, increases in 
owners’ equivalent rent have slowed noticeably over the past year, whereas rent inflation 
has remained about the same as a year earlier. 
Recent readings of inflation expectations  have been mixed.  According to the 
Reuters/Michigan survey in early October,  the median expectation for year-ahead 
inflation inched down to 3 percent—the same as  its level at the turn of the year—and the 
median expectation over the next five to te n years edged down to 2.8 percent, the lowest 
level since August 2005.  Meanwhile, five-yea r inflation compensa tion as derived from 
TIPS has remained relatively subdued, and fo rward inflation compensation five to ten 
years ahead has remained at the high end of  the range in which it has been observed in 
recent years. 
Price movements for goods at earlier stages  of processing have been mixed in recent 
months.  The PPI for core intermediate mate rials edged up in September after decreasing 
0.5 percent in August, bringing September’s tw elve-month change in core intermediate 
materials prices to 1.7 percent, down consid erably from the rise of 7.2 percent posted 
over the year-earlier period.  This step-down reflects (in part) the continued deceleration 
in prices for a wide variety of energy-inten sive goods, such as industrial chemicals and 
plastics, as well as a significant deceleration in the price of construction materials—some 
of which are also energy intensive—such as metal products, asphalt shingles, gypsum, 
cement, and paints.  In addition, lumber a nd plywood spot prices have dropped noticeably 
since the September Greenbook. 
Commodity prices have moved up further since the Septembe r PPI pricing date (which 
occurred around the time of the September Greenbook).  The Journal of Commerce  index 
of industrial materials has risen about 2.8 percent since mid-September, and the 
Commodity Research Bureau’s index of industrial spot pri ces is up about 4.2 percent, 
both reflecting, in part, large price increases for a variety of metals. 
Labor Costs 
The only timely information we have receiv ed on wages since the last Greenbook is the 
September reading for average hourly earnings  of production or nonsupervisory workers.  
With the increase of 0.4 percent in Sept ember, average hourly earnings were up 
4.1 percent over the twelve months ending in September, the same increase as a year 
earlier.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
The functioning of short-term funding ma rkets improved somewhat early in the 
intermeeting period, but conditions in these ma rkets remained strained.  Credit spreads 
declined in the commercial paper and term  interbank funding markets but stayed well 
above longer-term norms, and liquidity in th e Treasury bill market was still reportedly 
poor at times.  The expected path for mone tary policy moved lower after the FOMC’s 
announcement of a 50 basis point easing at its September meeting, as many investors 
were surprised by the magnitude of the reduc tion in the target rate.  The anticipated 
policy path beyond the middle of next year m oved down a bit further,  on net, over the 
remainder of the intermeeting period, in res ponse to heightened concerns about economic 
growth.  Two-year Treasury yields declined roughly in line with the lower expected 
policy path, and yields on ten-year Tr easuries were little  changed, on net. 
 Stock prices jumped early in the intermeeting period in response to the cut in the target 
federal funds rate and some favorable econom ic news, but dropped back in recent weeks, 
leaving broad indexes up 3 to 4 percent on net.  Corporate bond spreads narrowed 
somewhat, leaving private yields a little lo wer.   Nonfinancial bond issuance was quite 
strong, including a marked pickup in speculativ e-grade offerings.  C&I loans continued to 
soar, as some banks had to retain LBO loans that they had planned to syndicate.  The 
credit quality of most households remain ed strong, but delinquency rates on subprime 
mortgages climbed further.  Securitiza tion of nonconforming mortgages remained 
limited, and spreads on jumbo mortgages stayed  high.  According to responses from the 
October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surve y, banks have tightened their standards and 
terms on a range of loan categories over the past three months. 
 
Money Market Functioning 
The functioning of money markets improved ear ly in the intermeeting period, but some 
strains remain evident.  Spreads on a sset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) over 
comparably-rated unsecured financial paper conti nued to decline from their peaks in late 
August and early September, with the spreads on paper issued by multi-seller conduits, which typically have full liquidity support from banks, falling the most.  Spreads on nonfinancial unsecured paper also declined ov er the intermeeting period.  Outstandings of 
unsecured paper, which fell in August and Se ptember, turned up in October, and the 
runoff of ABCP slowed somewhat.  However, some ABCP conduits, particularly structured investment  vehicles (SIVs), 
continue to face severe fundi ng constraints.  Two SIV progr ams defaulted late in the

intermeeting period, and a proposal by a consor tium of large banks to create a Master 
Liquidity Enhanced Conduit that would pur chase selected assets of some ABCP 
programs as a means of avoiding asset “fire sales” met with mixed reviews from other 
market participants.  Interbank funding markets showed some impr ovement, with the spread between thirty-
day libor and comparable-maturity overnight index swaps declining markedly after the 
September FOMC announcement.  The spread edged down a bit further, on net, in 
subsequent weeks but remained atypically  high, reflecting elevated premiums for 
liquidity and counterparty risk.  The effectiv e federal funds rate, which had traded well 
below the target at times before the Septem ber meeting, has averaged close to the new 
target since then but has remained relativ ely volatile.  Liquidity conditions in the 
Treasury bill market improved early in the in termeeting period but were still strained, 
with bid-asked spreads staying above the le vels prevailing before August.  Rates on 
three-month bills declined 17 basis points, on net, amid substantial volatility that was likely exacerbated by a paydown of Treasury bill s.  Overnight repo rates also displayed 
heightened volatility  on some days.   
 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The expected path for monetary poli cy dropped after the September FOMC 
announcement of a 50 basis point cut in the targ et federal funds rate.  Policy expectations 
firmed somewhat over the next  three weeks, particularly in response to a better-than-
expected employment report.  However, disa ppointing news about activity in the housing 
sector and a resurgence of concerns about mortgage and other credit markets pushed 
policy expectations back down late  in the intermee ting period.   
 Investors now see high odds that the FOMC will further reduce the target federal funds 
rate at the October meeting, most likely by 25 basis points.  Looking further ahead, 
futures markets quotes imply an expected fede ral funds rate of 3.8 percent by the end of 
2008—about 25 basis points below where it stood  just before the September meeting.  
Uncertainty about monetary policy, as meas ured by implied volatilities derived from 
options on Eurodollar futures contracts, de clined a bit further, on net, over the 
intermeeting period from the very high levels  reached in August.  These options also 
indicate that the distribution of future po licy rates remains skewed to the downside. 
 
Yields on two-year nominal Treasury coupon secu rities fell 28 basi s points, broadly in 
line with the decline in policy expectations, a nd ten-year Treasury yields declined just

Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity indexes rose about 3 to 4 per cent, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
Stock prices surged on the heels of the cut in the target federal funds rate and rose further 
following the October employment report.  However, mixed news in third-quarter 
earnings reports and renewed concerns about  the consequences of weakness in housing 
markets weighed on share prices more recently.  Stocks of financial firms continued to be 
particularly volatile, first boosted by diminished concerns  about downside risks from 
financial market turmoil, but then dragge d back down by disappointing third-quarter 
reports from many bank holding companies that  were adversely affected by writedowns 
of leveraged loans and mortgage-related assets .  Options-implied volatility of returns on 
the S&P 500 dropped sharply after the Sept ember FOMC announcement but has since 
drifted back up and is well above its range in  the first half of the year.  The spread 
between the twelve-month forward trend ear nings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a 
real long-run Treasury yield—a  rough gauge of the equity  risk premium—was little 
changed.  Over the intermeeting period, corporate bond yields declined, leaving spreads on 
investment- and speculative-grade corpor ate bonds down about 15 and 20 basis points 
respectively.  These spreads ar e still near their re cent highs but roughly in line with their 
averages over the past decade.  In the ma rket for nonfinancial commercial paper, the 
thirty-day A2/P2 quality spread narrowed to about 45 basis points. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
On the basis of nearly 200 reports in hand a nd analysts’ estimates for the rest, it appears 
that earnings per share for S&P 500 firms in th e third quarter were a bit lower than a year 
earlier—a sharp deceleration from the 10 pe rcent increase registered in the second 
quarter.  The falloff in the third quarter is mostly attributable to the financial sector, where earnings appear to have dropped about 15 percent from year-earlier levels.  In 
contrast, nonfinancial firms are estimated to  have logged four-quarter gains of nearly 
5 percent.  Substantial markdowns of forecas ts for financial firms’ current-year profits 
pulled revisions to expected earnings fo r the S&P 500 into negative territory in 
September and October.  Even so, analyst fo recasts remain surprisingly optimistic, with 
year-over-year growth now projected to bounce back to nearly 10 percent in the fourth 
quarter and beyond.

The credit quality of nonfinancial corporati ons appears to have remained strong through 
September.  In the second quarter, nonfinanci al corporate leverage increased slightly but 
remained near the low end of its range over the past twenty years, and the sector’s 
balance-sheet liquidity remained high by hist orical standards.  Rating downgrades on 
corporate bonds continued to be modest th rough August, and the six-month trailing bond 
default rate stayed near zero in Septembe r.  KMV’s aggregate year-ahead expected 
default rate, which had increased somewhat in August, inched up a bit further last month.  
 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinan cial corporations remained strong in 
September and continued apace into October.  Speculative-grade bond issuance, though still sluggish in September, picked up marked ly in October, and a couple of offerings to 
finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs)  cleared the market for the first time since late June.  
Even so, the backlog of LBO-related deals re mains very large.  Ou tstanding nonfinancial 
commercial paper dipped again in September but edged up in the first half of this month.  
Meanwhile, C&I loans continued to soar, in part as banks retain ed on their books loans 
that they had intended to syndicate.  Respons es from the October Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey indicate that a significant num ber of banks have tightened standards and 
terms on loans to businesses over the past three months, consistent with the shift in risk 
pricing in the bond market.  Overall, net de bt financing was robust in September and 
appears to have picked up a bit in October.  Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial co rporations was light in September but has 
strengthened a bit this month.  We estimate th at equity retirements posted another record 
in the third quarter, as repurchases rema ined robust and cash-financed mergers and 
acquisitions soared.  A sizable volume of  LBOs, a component of cash mergers, was 
completed in the third quarter, but almost no new large LBO deals have been announced since early July.  In contrast, the pace of  announcements of small- and middle-market 
M&A deals has continued to be quite robust.  
Commercial Real Estate  
Spreads on BBB-rated commercial-mortg age-backed securities (CMBS) over 
comparable-maturity Treasuries remained  elevated over the intermeeting period, 
reportedly reflecting ongoing c oncerns among investors and rating agencies about high 
levels of leverage on recently securitized co mmercial mortgages, as well as persistent 
worries about structured financial products in general.  The increase in CMBS yields

pushed up interest rates on commercial mortgages originated for securitization to their 
highest levels since late 2002.  Issuance of CMBS was robust in the third qu arter, primarily because of a backlog of 
loans that were originated earlier this year.  However, originations  data and the issuance 
calendar point to a marked slowing of CMBS  offerings in the fourth quarter, likely 
reflecting both the higher cost of capital in recent months a nd tighter underwriting 
standards.  CMBS issuers have  gradually responded to conc erns of investors and rating 
agencies by reducing leverage and increas ing credit support in newly issued pools. 
 Although delinquency rates on commercial mortga ges have shown no signs of increasing 
from their recent low levels, the volume of real estate transactions continues to fall from record highs in the first half of the year, led by a sharp decline in LBOs of REITs, as 
buyers that had depended on high leverage are withdrawing from the market.  Alternate 
sources of financing such as commercial banks and insurance companies, which historically have had more c onservative underwriting standard s, picked up market share 
as CMBS-financed lending contracted.   
Household Finance 
On a year-over-year basis, growth of home mortgage debt slowed in the second quarter, 
in line with the sharp deceleration in house pric es and the drop in home sales.  Consumer 
credit continued to expand moderately through August.  Over the intermeeting period, in terest rates on fixed-rate an d variable-rate conforming 
mortgages for prime borrowers increased 6 a nd 11 basis points respectively.  The spread 
between interest rates offered on jumbo fixed-rate prime mortgages and those on 
conforming thirty-year loans—our best indicator of pricing in the jumbo market—moved down 17 basis points but remained well above the levels seen earlier this year.  Notably, 
results from the October Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey indica te that substantial 
fractions of respondents had tightened standa rds on prime, as well as nontraditional and 
subprime, mortgages over the past three months.  The variable-rate subprime mort gage delinquency rate rose  sharply again in August, 
reaching almost 16 percent.  Delinquency ra tes on subprime fixed-rate mortgages ticked 
up again in August, but rates on prime mortgages stayed low.   Delinquency rates on most 
consumer loans have also remained at low levels.  Nonetheless, a sizable share of

surveyed banks reported tightening standard s for consumer installment loans over the 
past three months.    Issuance of mortgage-backed securities (MBS ) for subprime and Alt-A pools was limited 
in the third quarter, as underwriters expe rienced severe difficulties placing these 
securities with investors.  The limited data for October suggest that credit conditions for 
nonprime MBS remained very tight.  Subprim e mortgage credit default swap (CDS) 
index spreads—as measured by the ABX—wide ned further, and Standard and Poor’s 
downgraded a large number of securities b acked by Alt-A and s ubprime residential 
mortgages.  In contrast, issu ance of credit card and auto a sset-backed securities (ABS) 
was relatively robust in the th ird quarter and in October. 
 Available monthly indicators suggest that house prices remained sluggish nationwide in 
the third quarter.  According to futures quotes on the S&P/Ca se-Shiller indexes, market 
participants expect a further decline of home prices in te n of the largest metropolitan 
markets in coming months.  The ratio of household net worth to disposab le income likely inched down in the third 
quarter, held down by soft house prices and stoc k prices that were roughly flat on net.  
Long-term mutual funds, which registered net redemptions in August, had solid net inflows into all major fund categories in Se ptember, a pattern th at continued into 
October.  Assets in money market funds—i ncluding both retail and institutional funds—
grew rapidly again in September, but the infl ow fell well short of August’s record-setting 
figure. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
The Treasury conducted auctions of two- and five-year nominal coupon securities and 
five- and ten-year TIPS over the intermeeti ng period, and the auctions were generally 
well received by investors.  Liquidity in sec ondary markets for intermediate and longer-
term Treasuries improved somewhat over the intermeeting period, as bid-asked spreads 
for coupon securities retreated from recent hi ghs.  Liquidity premiums for on-the-run 
two- and ten-year securities were little ch anged.  Spreads on agency debt yields over 
those on comparable-maturity Treasuries  declined slightly on net.

remained below their pace over the first half of  the year, and short-term issuance slowed, 
following its typical seasonal pattern.    Indicators of municipal-bond cr edit quality have improved of late.  The number of rating 
upgrades significantly outpaced downgrades in the third quarter.  Also, the ratio of 
municipal bond yields to thos e on comparable-maturity Treasuries has retraced most of 
the jump in August, as concerns about th e possible exposure of municipal bond insurers 
to mortgage-related losses diminished.    
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 grew at an average annual rate of 5½ percent in Septem ber and October, about half 
the pace in August.  Small time deposits grew apace, as banks apparently offered 
attractive rates to help fund their expanding loan portfolios.  Assets in retail money 
market funds rose rapidly.  In the third quart er, the velocity of M2 resumed the decline 
that began about a year ago.  Commercial bank credit grew vi gorously again in September,  as C&I loans expanded at 
an annual rate of 44 percent, the fastest mont hly pace in more than thirty years.  The 
surge in C&I loans occurred primarily at larg e banks and banks affiliated with securities 
firms—institutions that likely retained on their books loans that had been intended for 
syndication.  That said, C&I loan growth at sm aller banks was solid as well.  Most other 
loan categories also expanded briskly in Se ptember, but non-home-e quity mortgage loans 
were about flat after adjusti ng for thrift acquisitions by banks.  Bank credit continued to 
surge in the first two weeks of October, driven by C&I lendin g and acquisitions of 
securities.  The hefty increase in bank credit  comes despite indications, from the October 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, that banks had tightened standards and terms for 
C&I loans, commercial mort gages, prime and nonprime mortgages, and consumer loans 
over the past three months.

Appendix 
III-A-1 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
 
The October 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.1 Special questions in the survey queried banks about changes in their lending 
policies for backup lines of credit for commercial paper programs and prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans.  As in the past two surveys, banks were asked separately about 
changes in credit standards and demand for prim e, nontraditional, and subprime residential 
mortgages.  This appendix is based on respon ses from fifty domestic banks and twenty foreign 
banking institutions.  In the October survey, domestic and foreign ins titutions reported having tightened their lending 
standards and terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the previous three months. 
Both domestic and foreign institutions also reported a tightening of lending standards on 
commercial real estate loans.  On net, domestic  banks indicated that demand for C&I loans had 
weakened over the survey period, whereas forei gn institutions reported that demand for these 
loans was little changed.  Both domestic and foreign institutions noted weaker demand for 
commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  In the household sector, domestic banks reported, on net, tighter lending standards and terms on consumer loans other than credit card 
loans, as well as tighter lending standards on pr ime, nontraditional, and subprime residential 
mortgages over the survey period.  Lending sta ndards on credit card loans were, by contrast, little 
changed.  Demand for residential mortgages a nd consumer loans of all types had reportedly 
weakened, on net, over the past three months.            
Business Lending 
 
Questions on C&I lending.  In the October survey, one-fifth of domestic institutions, on 
balance, reported that they had tightened thei r lending standards on C&I loans to large and 
middle-market firms over the past three months rela tive to the previous three months.  While the 
net fraction of domestic respondents reporting ti ghter lending standards over the survey period 
was only somewhat higher than in the July survey , the fraction of domestic institutions that 
reportedly increased spreads of loan rates over th eir cost of funds increased sharply in the 
October survey, to about one-third.  Domestic respondents also reported having tightened several price-related terms on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms over the survey period: 
Significant net fractions of banks indicated that they had increased the cost of credit lines and premiums charged on loans to riskier borrowers.   One-fifth of domestic banks, on net, reported 
more stringent covenants on loans to large and middle-market firms—the first net tightening of 
such covenants in a few years.

Smaller net fractions of domest ic banks reported that they had tightened their C&I lending 
policies for small firms over the past three months .  On net, one-tenth of respondents—a fraction 
similar to that in the July survey—reported tightening their lending standards on C&I loans to 
small firms, and one-fifth of domestic institutions reported charging higher  loan rate spreads on 
such loans.  Compared with domestic banks, larger net fractions of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reportedly tightened their lending standard s and terms on C&I loans over the past three 
months.  About one-third of foreign responde nts—up from one-eighth in the July survey—
indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on C&I loans.  About two-thirds of 
respondents reportedly widened spreads of loan rat es over their cost of funds, and a similar net 
fraction indicated that they had increased the cost of credit lines and raised premiums charged on loans to riskier business borrowers.  Almost all domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having 
tightened their lending standards and terms on C& I loans pointed to a less favorable economic 
outlook as a reason for having done so.  Larg e majorities of both domestic and foreign 
respondents also cited decreased liquidity in the secondary market and reduced tolerance for risk 
as reasons for a move toward more-stringent le nding policies.  By contrast, relatively few 
respondents indicated that concerns about thei r banks’ capital ratios had contributed to the 
tightening of lending standards and terms.  The net fractions of domestic respondents that  reported a weakening of demand for C&I loans 
from large and middle-market firms as well as small firms over the past three months were a bit smaller than in the July survey.  About one- eighth of domestic respondents noted weaker C&I 
loan demand from large and middle-market firms,  and one-tenth of banks indicated weaker 
demand from small firms.  The demand for C&I loans at foreign institutions was reportedly 
unchanged, on net, over the past three months.  Regarding future business, about 20 percent of 
domestic respondents and 10 percent of foreign r espondents reported that the number of inquiries 
from potential business borrowers had decreased re lative to the previous three months.   
 
Special questions on commercial paper backup lines of credit.   According to the October 
survey, both domestic and to an even greater exte nt foreign institutions had tightened, on net, 
their lending standards and terms for providing  backup lines of credit for commercial paper 
programs over the past three months.
2  About half of the domestic and two-thirds of the foreign  
                                                      
2 The number of domestic respondents to this set of special questions varied from sixteen to twenty-six, 
depending on the question. According to Call Reports, these institutions accounted for between 35 percent 
and 48 percent of C&I loans on the books of all domestic commercial banks as of June 30, 2007.  The number of foreign respondents varied from fourteen to seventeen; these institutions accounted for between 
40 percent and 54 percent of C&I loans on the books of all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks as 
of June 30, 2007.

respondents reported a tightening of lending st andards and terms on backup credit lines for 
single-seller, multi-seller, and other types of asset-backed commercial paper programs.  
Furthermore, about 25 percent of domestic and 60 percent of foreign respondents reported that 
they had tightened lending st andards and terms on credit lines for unsecured A2/P2-rated 
commercial paper programs; less than 10 percent of domestic and about 40 percent of foreign 
respondents indicated that they had instituted more-stringent lending policies on credit lines for 
A1/P1-rated commercial paper programs.  Questions on commercial real estate lending.  The net fraction of domestic banks that reported 
having tightened their lending standards for co mmercial real estate loans over the past three 
months increased notably, to 50 percent, relative to  the July survey.  The net fraction of foreign 
institutions that reported tightening their le nding standards on such loans was, at about 
40 percent, little changed compared with the Ju ly survey.  Regarding demand, approximately 
38 percent of domestic and foreign institutions —up from about 25 percent in the July survey—
reported that demand for commercial real estate loan s had weakened over the survey period.     
 
Lending to Households 
 
Questions on residential real estate lending.  In the October survey, significant numbers of 
domestic respondents reported that they had ti ghtened their lending standards on prime, 
nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgag es over the past three months; the remaining 
respondents indicated that their lending standard s had remained basically unchanged.  About 
45 percent of respondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages, compared with only about 15 percent th at reported having done so in the July survey.
3  
Of the thirty-eight banks that originated nontra ditional residential loans, about 65 percent—up 
from around 40 percent in the July survey—reported a tightening of their lending standards on such loans over the past three months.
4  Finally, five of the eight banks that originated subprime 
mortgage loans noted that they had tightened th eir lending standards on such loans, a slightly 
larger proportion than in the July survey.5   
 About half of the domestic respondents, on net, indicated that demand for prime, nontraditional, 
and subprime residential mortgages had weakened further over the past three months.  The net 
fractions reporting weaker demand for prime a nd nontraditional mortgage loans increased  
                                                     
 
3 Forty-seven institutions reported that they had or iginated prime residential mortgages. According to 
Call Reports, these forty-seven banks accounted for about 73  percent of residential real estate loans on the 
books of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2007. 
4 According to Call Reports, these thirty-eight institu tions accounted for about 71  percent of residential 
real estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2007. 
5 According to Call Reports, these eight institutions accounted for about 47 percent of residential real 
estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2007.

noticeably compared with the Ju ly survey, whereas the net fraction reporting weaker demand for 
subprime loans was only a little larger than in July.  Special questions on prime jumbo mortgage loans.   On net, about 45 percent of domestic 
respondents indicated that the volume of their banks ’ originations for prime residential mortgage 
loans that were above the conforming loan  limit had declined over the survey period.
6  Regarding 
securitizations of such loans, about 40 percen t of respondents reported that the share of new 
prime jumbo mortgage originations that was secu ritized over the past three months had declined 
relative to the previous survey period; the rema ining respondents indicated that there had been no 
substantial change in the share of such secur itizations.  Domestic banks reportedly tightened 
several lending terms on prime jumbo loans over the past three months.  In particular, significant fractions of respondents reported that they had in creased loan fees and spreads of mortgage loan 
rates over their cost of funds and that they  are requiring more-stringent income and asset 
documentation as well as higher minimum downpayments.  Questions on other consumer lending.  One-fourth of domestic banks—up from about 
10 percent in the July survey—reported that they had tightened their lending standards on consumer loans other than credit cards over the p ast three months.  Moderate net fractions of 
banks also indicated that they had tightened le nding terms on such loans; in particular, they 
reduced the extent to which such loans were granted to customers who did not meet credit-
scoring thresholds and increased minimum credit scor es and spreads of loan rates over their cost 
of funds.  A few banks indicated a diminished willingness to make consumer installment loans relative to three months earlier.  Lending standa rds and terms on credit card loans were reportedly 
little changed, on balance, over the past three m onths, although one-tenth of respondents reported 
that they had widened spreads of loan rat es over their cost of funds on such loans.

In August, the value of exports of goods a nd services increased 0.4 percent following a 
2.7 percent increase in July.  The August incr ease was split between higher exports of 
services and exports of goods.  Goods expor ts were boosted by a jump in exports of 
agricultural products and gold, wh ich more than offset a d ecline in exports of other 
goods.  Exports of automotive products fell back sharply following a surge in July.  
Exports of capital goods contracted  slightly, led by a drop in e xports of aircraft.  Exports 
of semiconductors declined, whereas exports of computers were flat.  
 
The average value of exports in July and A ugust increased 20 percent (a.r.) from the 
second quarter.  Almost all major categories of  exports recorded large increases, with 
exports of aircraft, automob iles, machinery, industrial supplies, and agri cultural goods 
exhibiting particular strength.  In contra st, exports of semiconductors declined.

The value of imported goods and services fe ll 0.4 percent in A ugust after increasing 
1.7 percent in July.  The decline reflected lo wer imports of goods, as imports of services 
were flat.  Higher imports of oil and cap ital goods, particularly computers and 
semiconductors, were more than offset by lower imports of non-oil industrial supplies, 
automotive products, and consumer goods.  A la rge decline in imports of natural gas, 
largely reflecting lower prices, contributed to the decline in  non-oil industr ial supplies, 
while weaker imports of pharmaceuticals helped hold back consumer goods.  
 
The average value of imports in July and A ugust increased 11¼ percent (a.r.) from the 
second quarter.  All major categories of imports  increased over the period, with imports 
of automotive products, oil, and capital goods making the largest contributions to the 
increase. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In September, prices of U.S. imports of core goods fell 0.1 percent, the 
first decline since February.  Lower prices fo r industrial supplies, particularly metals, 
were behind the decline.  Fo r the third consecutive month, prices for imported foods rose 
sharply, increasing 1.2 percent.  Prices for imported finished goods rose 0.2 percent for the fourth straight month.  After increasing in August, prices for imported computers and 
semiconductors both fell in September.  Prices  for imported natural gas fell 4.2 percent in 
September, following a 12.6 pe rcent decline in August. 
 
The average level of imported core goods prices in the third quarter was 3 percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter level.  Pr ices for material-inten sive goods were up 
4¾ percent, lifted by higher pri ces for foods, whereas prices for finished goods increased 
2½ percent.  Prices for semiconductors were  up 3¾ percent after a steep second-quarter 
decline of 16¼ percent.  In  the third quarter, prices for imported natural gas fell 
52 percent at an annual rate. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil ro se 5.4 percent in September, following a 
1.1 percent decrease in August, since January, the price of  imported oil has increased 
about 40 percent.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WT I) crude oil increased 
10 percent in September to average about $80 per barrel for the month as a whole.  In October, the spot price of WTI crude oil surged, peaki ng at $89.48 on October 18.  The 
spot price has subsequently edged down, closing at $86.48 on October 23.  Support for 
the high level of oil prices appears to have co me in part from concer ns about the level of 
inventories, both in the Unite d States and abroad, going in to the high-demand winter

months.  These concerns were exacerbated by threats of a Turkish invasion into Iraq, 
which could disrupt oil supplies from the regi on.  In addition, market participants appear 
highly skeptical that OPEC will act to alleviate near-term tightness in the oil market. 
 
Exports.   Prices of U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.4 percent in September.  After three 
months of large increases, prices for ag ricultural exports ju mped 4.1 percent in 
September.  Higher prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans accounted for much of the 
increase.  Prices for nonagricultu ral industrial supplies fell 0.2 percent, as lower prices for 
chemicals, copper, and aluminum offset higher prices for fuel and steel-making materials.  
Prices for exported finished goods rose 0.1 per cent in September, a rate similar to that 
observed in August.  Prices for exported co mputers fell 0.1 percent, whereas prices for 
semiconductors moved up. 
 
The average level of exported core goods pric es in the third quarter was 3 percent at an 
annual rate above the second-quarter level.  In  the third quarter, pr ices for agricultural 
products were up 24 percent, whereas prices for nonagricultural indus trial supplies were 
little changed.  Prices for finished goods ro se 2 percent, reflecting higher prices for 
consumer goods and capital goods excluding co mputers and semiconductors.  After sharp 
price declines in the first half of 2007, the rate of deflation for computer export prices 
slowed in the third quarter.   
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions  
This summer’s financial market turmoil had a noticeable effect on U.S. financial flows in 
August.  Foreign private purchases of U.S. Tr easury securities spiked  up to a record $45 
billion in an apparent “flight to safety” (l ine 4a of the Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions table).  These large purchases of  U.S. Treasuries in August were more than 
offset by exceptionally large sales of other U. S. securities.  Private foreigners sold $39 
billion in corporate stocks (line 4d), and foreign demand for U.S. debt was also weak, 
with foreign residents selling, on net, $12 bill ion of corporate and municipal bonds (line 
4c) and $5 billion of agency bonds (line 4b). We note that the reductions in private foreigners’ holdings of bonds coincided with unusually low issuance of U.S. corporate 
bonds during the third quarter, about half the pace  of issuance recorded in the first half of 
the year.  On balance, foreign investors sold $11 billion of U.S. securities in August (line 
4).  With the exception of agency bonds, these securities flows are unprecedented and are in sharp contrast to recent trends (top panels of the ch art on Private Security Flows). 
  
IV-8 
Flows from foreign official inve stors also deviated from past  patterns.  Foreign official 
investors recorded an outflow of $18 billion in Augus t, compared to an inflow of          
$46 billion in July (line 1).  Declines in U.S. holdings by fo reign official investors are 
unusual (the last one was in April 2003), and the magnitude of the decline in August was 
large (top-left panel of the ch art on Foreign Official Financia l Flows).   
 
 
 
 
 
.   
     
U.S. transactions in foreign securities appear to have been less affected by the turm oil.   
After a relatively weak July, U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities picked up to $36 billion in August (line 5), bringing the average fo r the two months back to near its pace of 
the first half of the year (bottom-left pane l of the chart on Private Security Flows).   
 Monthly data for the banking sector (line 3) show a record net outflow of $100 billion during August, com
pared with a net inflow of  $58 billion during July.  Much of this 
swing can be attributed to the market turmoil, as the spread between the repo and Treasury rates shifted up marked ly during the last week of August and nearly two-thirds 
of the outflow was associated with a reduc tion in U.S. bank borrowings from foreigners 
via RPs.   Combining all the monthly recorded flows, for both official and private transactions, yields a net outflow of $165 billion for August.  However, this figure does not include 
direct-investm
ent flows, which are recorded onl y quarterly.  Also, data  on U.S. residents’ 
holdings of foreign short-term securities, such as foreign commercial paper, are only available quarterly; a reduction in U.S. holdings of these secu rities represents a financial 
inflow (included in line 10) that would help  close the apparent gap between the current 
account and the flows that finan ce it.  Further, the relative stability of the dollar in August 
suggests that the net demand for U.S. assets  (from both domestic a nd foreign investors) 
did not decline appreciably, although the com position of that demand shifted from what 
has prevailed in recent months.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
Following the larger-than-expected cut in  the federal funds target announced on 
September 18, equity prices rose across the gl obe and risk spreads a nd implied volatilities 
on a wide range of assets declined.  These movements continued for several weeks after 
the FOMC meeting.  Although equity markets ga ve back some of their gains and risk 
spreads rose late in the pe riod in response to weak US housing data and disappointing 
bank earnings reports, market conditions improve d on net over the intermeeting period.    
 
Conditions in European interbank money market s, which had been severely strained since 
early August, improved substant ially at the shortest maturi ties over the period, although 
improvements for longer maturities were mo re modest.  The amount of outstanding 
asset-backed commercial paper issued in Eur ope declined sharply until early October but 
has since stabilized.  In an attempt to allevi ate the stress in euro money markets, the 
European Central Bank continue d to provide large amounts of euro liquidity, particularly 
early in the intermeeting period.  The Bank of England also injected short-term liquidity 
and allowed banks greater flexibility in meeting target balances.  The Bank’s repeated offers to depositary institutions of three-m onth funds at a penalty rate of 6.75 percent 
were shunned, however, as three-month sterling market interest rates remained below the 
penalty rate.  
 
The trade-weighted exchange value of the do llar against the major foreign currencies fell 
3¼ percent over the intermeeting period, and th e dollar declined 1¾ percent against the 
currencies of our other important trading partners.  The dollar depreciated 5 percent against the Canadian dolla r, with the exchange rate crossi ng parity for the first time since 
1976; the Canadian currency was likely s upported by better-than-expected Canadian 
employment data and rising crude oil and metals prices .  The dollar depreciated 
2½ percent versus the euro and sterling over the period, but only 1¼ percent against the 
yen, reportedly as some investors reestablished yen-funded carry-trade positions.  Consistent with this interpretation, the dolla r depreciated 7 percent against the Australian 
dollar and 6 percent versus the New Zealand dollar, currencies often favored in yen 
carry-trades.  Major European indexes a nd the Nikkei index rose about 4 percent on 
balance, even after declines late in the period.  Ten-year European sovereign yields 
declined a few basis points on net, but Japan’s ten-year benchmark yield rose 5 basis points.  As the yields on corresponding te n-year inflation-indexed bonds registered 
movements that were close to those of the nominal bonds, inflation expectations appeared 
to be little changed in these economies. 
IV-13 
Financial markets in emerging economies we re also buoyed in the weeks following the 
September FOMC meeting.  The Mexican peso and Brazilian real appreciated 2½ and 
5½ percent, respectively, against the dollar, and Mexican and Brazilian stock indexes 
rose 8 and 15 percent over th e intermeeting period.  Most currencies in em
erging Asia 
appreciated 1 to 4 percent against the dollar.  The renminbi’s spot exchange value against 
the dollar appreciated ½ per cent over the period, but the one-year forward exchange 
value of the Chinese currency rose 2½ percen t; it now prices in a 6½ percent appreciation 
against the dollar in twelve m onths.  Chinese stock prices ro se 8 percent over the period, 
but Hong Kong equity prices surged 20 percent.   Equity indexes in Korea, Taiwan, and 
Thailand rose 5 to 8 percent.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Third-quarter indicators of ec onomic activity for the advan ced foreign economies have 
been solid on balance.  In the euro ar ea, production and sales rebounded in the third 
quarter from their second-quarter levels.  However, recent surveys, including the 
movements on balance in the purchasing mana ger’s index (PMI) for the service sector, 
point to a notable slowin g in activity.  Likewise, the prel iminary estimate of third-quarter 
growth in U.K. real GDP (based mostly on the first two months of the quarter) was 
3.3 percent, though recent surveys s uggest that growth slowed only slightly in September.  
Recent Canadian data have been mixed, with  relatively strong employment growth and 
some weakness in retail sales.  In contrast, Japanese retail  sales and exports rebounded in 
August, and the Tankan survey for October se ems to lend credence to the view that the 
second quarter’s sharp contracti on in investment was temporary. 
 
To date the decline in some surveys in the euro area in the last couple months is one sign of a potential effect of the recent turmoil in financial markets.  In addition, credit 
standards at euro area banks have tightene d for both households and businesses in the 
third quarter.  Mortgage lending has also slowed in the United Kingdom, and lenders 
reported that they had reduced corporate cr edit availability in the third quarter. 
 
The four-quarter rate of head line inflation in Canada and the euro area rose to 2.5 percent 
and 2.1 percent, respectively, in September.   However, core inflation remained 
contained—edging down in Canada and staying the same in the euro area—and the quarterly rate of headline inflation moved lowe r in the third quarter.  The inflation rate 
edged down in the United Kingdom since th e last Greenbook, and prices in Japan 
continued to fall slightly.  
 
In Japan , the October Tankan survey continued to  portray an economy that is expanding 
moderately, with the headline index of ec onomic sentiment among large manufacturers 
remaining unchanged from June and high by hist orical standards.  On the other hand, 
perceptions of the economy held by small manufacturing firms and all sizes of non-manufacturing firms have worsened since June.  The survey also pointed to robust capital 
spending plans by large- and medium-sized fi rms, which supports the Bank of Japan’s 
view that the fall in capital expenditures in the second quarter is likely to be temporary.  
The survey indicated an across-the-board impr ovement in the sales outlook and that firms 
continued to see the labor market and resource utiliz ation as relatively tight.

Economic indicators for August have also been relatively positive.  Industrial production 
rebounded strongly from the decline in Jul y, as automakers recovered from the 
production disruption caused by the Niigata ear thquake on July 16.  Retail sales and real 
household expenditures also bounced back some from recent declines over the previous 
two months.  Net exports continued to rise in the third quarter, supported by strong export 
growth to Asia and Europe.  However, housing starts tumbled in August, as stricter rules regarding the approvals of construction plans were adopted  by the government earlier this 
summer. 
 
The labor market remains strong, with th e unemployment rate rising slightly to 
3.8 percent in August from the nine-year low registered in July.  The job offers-to-
applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings rela tive to the number of 
officially registered job seek ers) edged down to 1.06, still close to a fifteen-year high.  
Earnings growth moved furthe r into negative territory, however, as total cash earnings 
(which include bonuses) fell 0.8 pe rcent from a year earlier. 
 
The nationwide core consumer price index (e xcluding fresh food only)  fell 0.1 percent in 
August from a year earlier, the seventh consecu tive month of decline.   Moreover, the core 
CPI for Tokyo, a leading indicator of prices, al so declined 0.1 percen t from a year earlier 
in September. 
 
Former Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda wa s elected Prime Minister on September 25, 
following the resignation of form er Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Mr. Fukuda stated the 
need to continue the reforms initiated under Prime Minister Koizumi, but also mentioned the need to pay more attention to regional income disparities. 
 
Readings of activity in the euro area  have been strong on average in the third quarter, 
though more recent figures indicate some slowing.  Average retail sales for July and August retail sales were up 0.6 percent relative to the second quarter, the strongest gain in 
the past year.  However, the monthly pace of sales has slowed over the past three months.  
Household spending has been supported by a favorable job market: the unemployment rate remained at a record-l ow 6.9 percent in August, down nearly one percentage point 
from a year earlier.  Euro-area industrial production (excluding construction) rose in 
August; the July/August average was up a st rong 1.7 percent relative to the second 
quarter.  Production strength was broad-ba sed across capital goods, intermediate goods, 
and consumer goods.

Surveys of activity and confidence measures weakened considerably in September and 
October.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI dropped in September and, more sharply, in 
October (according to the flash estimate).  Th e services PMI register ed in September its 
largest one-month decline since the series started in 1998, al though nearly half of that 
decline was reversed in the flash October data.  The financial services sector was 
particularly hard hit in September, wh ere firms commonly cited the recent credit 
tightening and resulting financial uncertainty as the main  causes of reduced business 
activity.  The German services PMI showed a particularly sharp decline, consistent with 
German banks having faced especially larg e difficulties recently.  September economic 
sentiment tumbled more than in any m onth since October 2001.  Although overall 
industrial confidence re mains well above its long-run average, the components measuring 
the trend of recent production and production ex pectations fell.  Consumer confidence 
declined substantially for the second month in a row; confidence in the retail trade sector 
posted its largest monthly drop since 1995. 
 
The ECB’s survey of euro-area bank lending i ndicated sharply tighter credit standards in 
the third quarter.  The percen t balance of euro-area banks reporting a net tightening of 
credit standards for loans to enterprises was 31 percent in the third quarter, versus a net 
easing of 3 percent in the s econd quarter.  The percent balance of euro-area banks 
reporting a net tightening of credit standards for housing loans to households switched to 
12 percent in the third quarter from a net easing of 1 percent in the second quarter.  Banks 
indicated that the recent tensions in the cr edit markets have hampered their access to 
wholesale funding over th e past three months. 
 
Twelve-month euro-area inflation rose to 2.1 percent in September, according to the 
preliminary estimate.  The increase was widely anticipated by analysts and mostly represents a base effect: the removal of the monthly change for September 2006, when energy prices declined sharply, from the twelve-month calculation.  
 
In the United Kingdom , real output grew 3.3 percent (a.r .) in the third quarter according 
to the preliminary estimate.  Activities with in the business services and finance sector 
expanded 6.8 percent, nearly matching a four-year high achieved in the previous quarter.  
The economic expansion was also supported by strong retail sales, which grew 7 percent 
(a.r.) in third quarter as many retailers slashed prices to lower inventories.  The PMIs for 
services and manufacturing, which are derive d from surveys conducted mainly after the 
run on Northern Rock, both slid a touch in Se ptember but continue to indicate moderate

expansion.  Consumer confidence weakened s lightly in August, a nd business confidence 
fell back to its July level in October. 
 
Some indicators suggest that credit standards in the mortgage market may have tightened 
in the third quarter.  Gross mortgage lendi ng was up only 2.5 percen t on a twelve-month 
basis in September, its slowest pace in tw o years.  The number of mortgage loans 
approved reached a thirty-month low in Augus t.  Moreover, the underlying trend of house 
price inflation has moderated, especially ou tside London and the south-east region, after 
flirting with a double-digit rate for over a year. 
 
Activity in the labor market continued at a solid pace, and wage pressure remained 
contained.  The claimant count measure of the unemployment rate was unchanged at a 
thirty-year low of 2.6 percent in September.  The Labor Force Survey measure was also unchanged at 5.4 percent in July.  Average ea rnings including bonuses rose 4.2 percent in 
the twelve months ending in August, but uni t wage costs in the manufacturing sector 
declined 0.6 percent over the same period. 
 
The twelve-month rate of headline inflation was unchanged in September at 1.8 percent, 
after ticking down in August.  Inflation was held down by the phasing in of lower utility 
prices that were announced earlier this year and by lower price rises for clothing and footwear items.  Food price infl ation picked up, however, with particularly large rises in 
the price of dairy products.  Core infla tion, which excludes unprocessed food and energy, 
ticked down to 1.8 percent. 
 
In Canada , recent data have been mixed.  Monthly GDP growth in July was 1.9 percent 
(s.a.a.r.), slightly below market expectations.  GDP growth at this rate for the rest of the 
quarter would put third-quarter growth at  around 2.3 percent, well below its second-
quarter pace.  Goods-producing i ndustries showed a 1 percent d ecline, while output in the 
service-producing industries rose 3.3 percent.  Sales th rough August indicate some 
weakness in third-quarter consumption, though both retail sales and motor vehicle sales 
rose in August after declining during the previous two months.  Real shipments from 
manufacturing industries showed unusual volat ility in July and August, giving no solid 
indication of direction.  On net, shipments re main below their May level.  Housing starts 
surged in September; however, single-unit starts fell a little. 
 
Real imports rose sharply in July before fa lling back somewhat in August.  As with 
shipments data, the unusual monthly pattern a ppears to owe primarily to the automotive 
IV-27 
sector.  Imports of automotive products jumped 16.4 percent in July and fell 6.9 percent 
in August.  Real exports exhibi ted a similar, but more muted,  pattern.  On net, Canada’s 
nominal trade surplus in Augus t was well below its June level, implying a large negative 
contribution to third-quarter GDP growth. 
 
Employment rose by a solid 51 thousand jobs  in September.  However, gains in 
employment were concentrated in the public  sector, while privat e sector employment 
growth was muted.  From January to Septem ber, private and public sector employment 
increased by 43 thousand and 141 thousa nd jobs, respectively, compared with 
247 thousand and 17 thousand jobs over the same period in 2006. 
 
In September, the twelve-month rate of cons umer price inflation jumped 0.7 percentage 
point to 2.6 percent.  The acceleration in inflat ion was mainly attributable to the twelve-
month increase in gas prices; the rise in gas prices in September was only 0.8 percent.  
Core inflation, which excludes the eight most  volatile components and the effects of 
changes in indirect taxes, edged down further in September to 2 percent.  Average hourly 
wages increased 4.2 percent over the twelve mont hs ending in September.  This rate is 
the largest increase since the start of the series in 1997.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
 
Recent economic information, mostly through A ugust, shows no signs that the turmoil in 
financial markets has had a significant nega tive impact on real economic activity in 
emerging market economies.  Activity appears to have remained robust in emerging Asia, 
although down from its elevated second-quarter  pace, when growth in several countries 
was at double-digit levels.  Mexican economic i ndicators point to moderate growth in the 
third quarter.  In South America, activity has been strong, boosted by high commodities prices and, in Argentina and Venezuela, by expansionary macro policies.  Food prices 
continued to be a major source of infla tionary pressures in the emerging market 
economies.  Chinese authorities took severa l steps that were aimed at quelling rising 
prices. 
 
In China , incoming data point to some modera tion of activity.  The trade surplus 
narrowed in the third quarter  to $265 billion from $280 bill ion (a.r.) in the second 
quarter; export growth picked up a bit, but  the increase in import growth was more 
substantial.  Industrial produc tion has also decelerated in  recent months.  Chinese 
authorities announced a new set of measures in  early October to cool the country’s real 
estate market, including raising minimum do wn payment requirements for purchases of 
second homes and commercial property.  
 
Inflation moderated a touch in September, with  the 12-month increase in the headline CPI 
falling to about 6 percent from 6½ percent in August.  With money growth still elevated 
at about 18½ percent for the twelve months ending in Sept ember, authorities remain 
concerned about underlying inflat ion pressures, prompting them to take several steps to 
control prices.  First, the central bank raised benchm ark bank lending rates in mid-
September and reserve requirement ratios in mid-October.  Second, in mid-September, the government announced a freeze on prices that it controls (land, transport, utilities, and 
fuel) for the rest of the year.  However, f ood prices, which are not administered, were the 
source of the recent runup in consumer prices .  Third, the authorities announced that they 
will release some grain reserves and also decrease import duties on certain grains to 
stabilize food prices.  The measures aimed at releasing grain price pressures, which were 
generally anticipated, sh ould have some effect in curbing inflation. 
 
In late September, China formally launched its long-anticipated sovereign wealth fund.  
The fund will reportedly be given $200 billion of the country’s $1.4 trillion international 
IV-30 
reserves to make overseas investments.  Offi cials have stated that  that the wealth fund 
would aim to maximize returns while taking acceptable risks. 
 
China’s 17th Party Congress occurred in mid-October.   This is a five-y early meeting that 
establishes the new leadership and party line in major policy areas.  The political report 
of the Party Congress reiterated the policy priorities of market reform and openness and 
endorsed some limited progress on “inner-party  democracy.”  At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Party Congress announced the 25 members of the new Politburo (the 
“political bureau” that overs ees the Communist Party) and th e 9 members of that select 
group who will form the powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo.  There are 10 new members in the Politburo and 4 ne w members in the Standing Committee.  
President Hu Jintao was reappointed for a nother five-year term, as was Premier Wen 
Jiabao.  Two of the younger new members of  the Standing Committ ee, Mr. Xi Jinping 
(Party chief of Shanghai) and Mr. Li Keqiang (Party chief of Lianoni ng) are being billed 
as successors to the presidency and the premiership in 2012.  The leadership reshuffle is generally viewed as consolidati ng the authority of President Hu.

In Hong Kong, indicators of economic activity in the third quar ter show the economy 
carried forward momentum from the second quarter, when real GDP jumped 8.2 percent.  
In July and August, retail sale s volume was up 12 per cent versus a year earlier, compared 
with around 7½ percent in the firs t half of the year, boosted by an increase in tourism.  
Twelve-month inflation remained well under 2 pe rcent in the third quarter.  In his annual 
policy address in October, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tseng announced that salary and profit tax rates would be redu ced gradually over the next few years.

In Taiwan , economic indicators remained largely positive during the third quarter, 
particularly with respect to external dema nd, following strong GDP growth in the second 
quarter.  The trade surplus increased in the third quarter to its hi ghest level since 2005, 
with exports rising nearly 4 percent at a quarterly rate and imports up less.  Industrial 
production rebounded in September from a contr action in August, and was up on average 
in the third quarter.  Consumer price inflati on picked up in September, due largely to a 
sharp increase in food prices related to r ecent typhoons.  In response, the central bank 
raised its official discount rate ⅛ percentage point in September to 3¼ percent.

Recent data from South Korea suggest that activity remained  strong in the third quarter.  
Average industrial production for July a nd August was up 4 percent from the second 
quarter.  Indicators for consumer and business confidence were strong in the third 
quarter, and the unemployment rate continued to  decline.  The merc handise trade surplus 
edged higher, contributing to noticeable widening of the current account surplus.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation moderated to 2.3 percent in  the third quarter, 
below the central bank’s 2.5 to 3.5 percent target range.  Alth ough Bank of Korea left the 
policy rate unchanged at 5 percent at its October 11 meeting following two consecutive 
25-basis point increases, it remains concerned about the recent grow th in lending, notably 
to small and medium sized enterprises.

In Singapore , economic activity continued to expand at a strong pace in the third quarter.  
According to the advance unofficial estimates, real GDP grew 6.4 percent (s.a.a.r) from 
the previous quarter.  Average industrial pr oduction rose 13 percent in July and August 
from the second-quarter average despite a c ontraction in August, as production in the 
volatile biomedical sector surged and el ectronics production r ecovered.  Anecdotes 
indicate that strong ac tivity in construction and services  also contributed to the third-
quarter performance.  The trade surplus rema ined high in the third quarter.  In recent 
months, twelve-month consumer price inflat ion has been rising, owing not only to a 
2 percentage point increase in  the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July, but also to 
tighter economic conditions.  Concerns over rising inflation prompted the Monetary Authority of Singapore to announce that it w ill allow a more appreciated path for the 
currency at its October 10 meeting.

In India, economic indicators point to  a bit of slowing from th e rapid pace in the second 
quarter.  Average industrial production for July and August was slightly below the 
second-quarter level, and indi cators show declines in au to and electricity output in 
September.  After narrowing in July, the trade deficit widened sharply in August 
reflecting stable exports along with a jump in oil imports.  Inflation indicators have been 
mixed.  Twelve-month CPI inflation ticked up in August while inflation of the more 
closely watched wholesale price index decel erated further in September.  Neither 
consumer nor wholesale prices reflect risi ng oil prices, as ceili ngs on consumer fuel 
prices have not been adjusted since ea rly this year, when they were lowered. 
 
Strong capital inflows have put increasing pr essure on the Indian rupee, prompting the 
central bank to undertake substa ntial intervention operations and loosen restrictions on 
capital outflows.  In mid-October, the Indian  government also announced plans to restrict 
capital flows from unregulated overseas i nvestments into the Indian stock market, 
effective October 25.  International reserves  in October reached nearly $250 billion, 
30 percent of 2006 GDP in 2006.

Data from the ASEAN-4  indicate that economic growth in the region may have slowed 
from its strong pace in the second quarter.  Industrial production data were mixed; 
average production over July-August declined fro m the second-quarter level in Indonesia, 
but was up in Malaysia, Thailand, and the Phil ippines.  Trade surpluses in Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and Thailand narrowed slightly th rough the first two months of the third 
quarter.  Consumer price inflation picked up in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines 
during the third quarter, in part owing to food price pressures.  In Thailand, food prices 
also caused inflation in September to rise above 2 percent for the first time since early 
this year, but inflation for th e quarter as a whole fell as ra pid appreciation of the baht 
helped dampen import prices.  On October 4, the Philippine central bank cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to moderate growth in the third quarter.  Average 
industrial production in July  and August was up 1.3 percent from the second-quarter 
average.  The manufacturing and construction se ctors, areas of weakness earlier this year, 
continued to recover.  Oil production was down in the third quarter, however.  In mid-
September, Mexico's Congress approved Pres ident Felipe Calderon's plan to overhaul tax 
laws, the most significant economic reform in a decade.  The central provision of the tax 
bill is the establishment of a minimum corpor ate tax.  The fiscal overhaul is likely to 
significantly increase Mexico's tax revenues in the long run and thus ameliorate the 
government’s dependence on oil revenues. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation remained high at 3.8 percent in September, boosted by 
increases in prices of dairy products and tomatoes.  However, September marks the first 
month in the past year in which twelve-mont h headline inflation was within the Bank of 
Mexico's 2-to-4 percent inflation target range.  As in its previous monthly meetings since April, the central bank at its late-Septemb er meeting kept its benchmark rate, the 
overnight lending rate, steady at 7¼ percent beca use it expects inflation to remain within 
the target range.

In Brazil , data releases suggest that activity co ntinued to expand in the third quarter.  
August industrial production more than recove red from its July decline and was at a 
record high.  The trade surplus narrowed in the third quarter, as nominal exports were 
stable while nominal import growth continued to be strong.  Real ca pital goods imports in 
July were up nearly 50 percent on a tw elve-month basis.  Twelve-month headline 
consumer price inflation held steady at 4.3 pe rcent in September, as pressures from food 
prices abated, and core in flation remained at 3.6 per cent on a twelve-month basis. 
 
On October 17, the central bank held its policy rate  steady at 11¼ percent, in response to 
concerns about food price and domestic dema nd-side inflationary pressures.  The 
government announced that it is considering a sovereign wealth fund to manage a small 
part of the central bank’s $160 billion in international reserves.  The sovereign wealth 
fund would be focused on ensuring adequate liq uidity and security rather than seeking 
high returns.

In Argentina, indications are th at activity continued to be st rong in the third quarter.  The 
Index of Economic Activity (a monthly proxy of GDP) was up 2.2 percent on average in 
July and August from the second quarter.  Reported twelve-month consumer price inflation remained elevated in September at  8.6 percent, fueled by an increase in food 
prices.  (There continue to be allegations that Argentine authorities are tampering with 
the consumer price data.)  Credit conditions in Argentina have tightened considerably 
since July, despite the injection of liquidity  by the central bank and pressure on banks by 
IV-42 
the government to reduce rates.  Ahead of the October 28 presidential election, Cristina 
Fernández de Kirchner, President Ki rchner’s wife, has a commanding lead.

In Venezuela, macroeconomic policies continue d to be very expansionary ahead of the 
December referendum on a new constitution that  would further centra lize power with the 
executive and allow unlimited terms in offi ce for Chavez.  Monthly consumer price 
inflation in September was 1.4 percent, bringing twelve-month inflation to 15.3 percent, 
despite price controls and cuts in th e value-added tax earlier this year. 
 
In September, in an attempt to support th e currency, the government issued the third 
so-called Bond of the South, which consisted of the sale of roughly $0.6 billion of its holdings of Argentine government dollar-d enominated bonds and the sale of about 
$0.6 billion in Venezuelan government dol lar-indexed bonds.  The dollar-linked bonds 
are attractive because the govern ment allows investors to purchase them using bolivares 
at the official exchange rate, which is considerably higher th an the exchange rate in the 
parallel market.  Nevertheless,  the parallel market bolivar has continued to depreciate 
sharply since August and stood at 5,940 VE N per dollar on October 23, versus the 
official exchange rate of 2,144 VEN per dollar.

In Turkey, industrial production increas ed 2.4 percent in August, fueled by strength in 
the machinery and equipment sector.  Twelve-m onth consumer price inflation declined to 
7.1 percent in September, still above the Central Bank’s year-end target range of 
4 percent +/- 2 percent.  At its September and October meetings, the Central Bank cut its 
benchmark overnight borrowing and lending rates by a cumulative ¾ percentage point 
and one percentage point to 16¾ and 21½ per cent, respectively.  The Monetary Policy 
Committee indicated that the la gged effects of previous monetary tightening coupled with 
weakening external demand will continue to support the disinflation process.
