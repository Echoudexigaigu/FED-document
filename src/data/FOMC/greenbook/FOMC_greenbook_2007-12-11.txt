Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The latest data suggest that economic activ ity has decelerated sh arply in the current 
quarter after the robust gains of the summer.  The effects of the turmoil in financial 
markets appear to be spreading beyond real es tate, as gains in consumer outlays slowed 
to a crawl in the autumn and survey measures  of sentiment dropped further.  Many of the 
readings from the business sector have also  softened: In particul ar, industrial production 
fell in October, as did orders and shipment s for capital goods.  Private payrolls increased 
at a moderate pace during the summer and earl y fall, but initial claims for unemployment 
insurance have increased, on average, in rece nt weeks.  Headline inflation has moved 
higher over the past several months, reflecting larger increases in energy prices.  Core 
inflation, however, has remained modest. 
Labor Market Developments 
Employment gains have slowed somewhat in recent months.  Private payrolls increased 
at an average monthly rate of 78,000 over the past three months, about 45,000 per month less than during the preceding three months.  Employment in  manufacturing, residential 
construction, and other housing-related sectors such as real estate financing and building 
materials and garden-supply re tailers continued to decline in October.  Elsewhere, 
however, employment in most service-produci ng industries has continued to move up. 
Indicators from the household survey have poi nted to slightly weaker labor market 
conditions than indicated by the payroll surv ey.  In particular, the unemployment rate 
remained at 4.7 percent in October after m oving up 0.2 percentage poi nt over the third 
quarter.  The participation rate edged down 0.1 percentage  point in October, to 
65.9 percent; it has moved down about ½ percenta ge point since its re cent peak at the 
turn of the year. 
Although other indicators of labor demand ha ve weakened somewhat, they remain 
consistent with modest employment growt h.  The pace of layoffs has turned up since 
August, according to such indicators as in itial claims for unemployment insurance, 
layoffs reported in the JOLT survey, and the sh ort-term job-losers rate in the household 
survey.  Indicators of hiring—hires measured  in the JOLT survey and hiring plans 
reported by Manpower and the National Fede ration of Independent Business (NFIB)—
have edged down over the past six months, though they remain at healthy levels.  
Measures of labor market tightness, including the share of firms reporting that they had a 
hard-to-fill position and households’ assessments of job availa bility, suggest th at little has 
changed in the balance between supply  and demand since the beginning of 2007.

Productivity in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 
6.3 percent in the third quarter,  after a 2.2 percent ra te of increase in the second quarter.  
The recent jump in output per hour brings the ra te of increase over the past four quarters 
up to 2.7 percent, following four quarters over which productivity was about unchanged.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) fell 0.5 percent in October after small gains in August and 
September.  Although a weathe r-related drop in utilities output acc ounted for about a 
third of the October decline, production decreas es elsewhere were fairly widespread: The 
three-month diffusion index of IP moved belo w fifty for the first time since January, 
indicating that more industries registered falling output than  rising output.  Nonetheless, 
most forward-looking indicators remain modestly in positive territory.  In  manufacturing 
sectors for which we have weekly physical pr oduct data, the availabl e data suggest that, 
excluding motor vehicles, output edged up in N ovember.  Moreover, there appear to be 
few inventory imbalances, and strong export demand is tempering the ongoing drag on IP 
from the weak construction and motor vehicle sectors. 
The IP index for motor vehicles and parts fell  in October for the third consecutive month.  
Although light vehicle assemblies were essentia lly unchanged in October, a shift in the 
mix of production away from higher-value light  trucks and toward autos contributed to 
the decline.  Ward’s Communications curren tly estimates that assemblies will decline 
500,000 units in the fourth quarter.  At th e scheduled rate, motor vehicle production 
would subtract about ¾ percentage point (annual rate) from the rate of change in total IP 
this quarter.  The recent cuts to produc tion, coupled with steady demand (see next 
section), have brought inventor ies of domestic manufacturer s down to more-comfortable 
levels.  Elsewhere in transportation, commerc ial aircraft producti on registered another

solid gain in October.  However, Boeing’s deci sion to push back initial deliveries of its 
787 Dreamliner from mid-2008 to late 2008 will li kely damp production early next year.  
IP in high-tech industries increased a modest  0.5 percent in October.  High-tech output 
was restrained in October by the wildfi res in San Diego County, where several 
manufacturing plants were closed  during the week of the fires.1  The effects were 
primarily concentrated in computer IP, whic h was flat in October, and in the production 
of communications equipment, which decrea sed after four cons ecutive months of 
outsized gains.  Semiconductor IP posted a solid gain, as hea lthy MPU production in 
other parts of the country more than outw eighed the production di sruption associated 
with the wildfires. 
The available indicators point to moderate ga ins, on balance, in the output of high-tech 
industries during the next few m onths.  Intel’s revenue guidanc e for the fourth quarter is 
little changed from its level in the third-quarter  and is consistent with a slight slowing of 
real MPU production.  By contrast, domestic  orders for circuit boards have climbed 
notably in recent months, and the book-to-bill rati o remained above one in October, 
suggesting further production gains in comi ng months.  For communications equipment, 
Cisco reported that the recent financial market turmoil contributed to a slowing in orders 
from financial service providers in October.   However, a third-qua rter uptick in capital 
spending by telecommunications  service providers (TSPs) suggests that equipment 
spending—and therefore production—will rise mode stly over the remainder of the year.2 
Outside of energy, high-technology, and motor vehi cles and parts, production for most of 
the major market groups moved down in October.  Consumer goods output fell 0.6 percent, the result of widespread weakness in bot h durable and nondurable goods 
categories.  Output of business equipment e dged up, as the gains in commercial aircraft 
more than offset declines among other kinds of business equipment.  The index for construction supplies moved down in Octobe r for the fourth consecutive month.  
Materials output also declined in October,  with production likely curbed by the weak 
demand from the construction and motor vehicle sectors.  
                                                
 
1 Affected companies include Sony , Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Nokia.  Other industries 
affected by the wildfires include shipbuilding, bakeries and tortilla manufacturing, elect rical components, 
and aerospace parts.  However, the overall effect of the wildfires on total IP in October was minimal, 
amounting to a drag of less than 0.05 percentage point. 
2 A recent conversation with our contact at a major communications equipment manufacturer indicated that 
orders from TSPs were currently healthy.

Although the slower pace of motor vehicl e assemblies and the ongoing contraction in 
residential construction will likely restrain IP in the coming months, near-term indicators 
of manufacturing activit y continue to point, on balance, to  small gains.  The Institute for 
Supply Management’s diffusion index for new or ders remained above fifty in November, 
and the new orders indexes fr om the various regional survey s suggest little change in 
manufacturing output in the coming months.  Finally, the three-mont h moving average of 
the staff’s measure of real adjusted durabl e goods orders was about  flat in October. 
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of automobiles and light trucks were  at an annual rate of 16.2 million units in 
November, close to the pace that has prevaile d since the second quarter.  Sales have been 
relatively stable despite deterioration in consumer attitudes toward vehicle purchases.  The Reuters/University of Michigan survey’s  index of car-buying c onditions fell again in 
November, reaching its lowest level of the year.  Respondents expressed dissatisfaction 
with vehicle prices and intere st rates.  In addition, the percentage reporting concern over 
gasoline prices popped up last month, although it was well below the recent highs of last 
summer. 
Consumer Spending 
After posting notable gains this summer, cons umer spending has decelerated recently.  
Real spending was nearly flat in Septembe r and October.  Spending on goods excluding 
motor vehicles declined in October and was flat, on net, from August through October.  
Spending on services edged down a touch, on ba lance, in September and October, owing 
in part to an extraordinarily large drop in  securities commissions in September.  The 
latest readings on weekly chain store sales as  well as industry reports and surveys suggest 
subdued gains in November and an uneven start to the holiday shopping season. 
Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan and the 
Conference Board surveys, fell further in November; the Reuters/Michigan index now 
stands at its lowest level si nce Hurricane Katrina.  The se ntiment readings since late 
summer have been consistently below the le vel implied by predictive variables such as 
inflation, stock prices, an d employment conditions. 
Real DPI edged down in October following a sma ll gain in September.  With real income 
falling a bit and spending flat, the personal saving rate edged down to 0.5 percent in 
October.  Looking ahead, the recent increases in  gasoline prices will likely damp real DPI 
growth and put downward pressu re on the saving rate, at least for a time, as households 
attempt to smooth consumption.  Meanwhile, th e wealth-to-income ratio ticked down last

quarter as house prices fell a touch, and equity values were little ch anged on net.  Equity 
prices had moved down about 4 percent so far in the current quarter as of yesterday’s 
close. 
Housing  
Conditions in the housing market have deteriorated further in  recent months.  Sales of 
existing homes were flat in October followi ng sharp declines in August and September; 
new home sales in October were below their third-quarter pace.  These declines were 
likely exacerbated by the dete rioration in nonprime mortgage markets and the higher 
rates and tighter lending conditions for jumbo loans.  In response to weak demand and 
high inventories, homebuilders ha ve continued to cut production. 
Tightening financing conditions in mortgage  markets have continued to sap housing 
demand in recent months.  Nonprime mortgage originations (which include the subprime 
and alt-A categories) have slowed to a tr ickle since mid-summer, and data from the 
Federal Housing Finance Board’s Monthly Interest Rate Survey  suggest that the share of 
jumbo loans in total mortgage originations fe ll to 5 percent in Oc tober, about half its 
average share since early 2006.  In November, spreads between rates for jumbo and 
conforming thirty-year fixed-rate mortga ges were 55 basis poi nts wider than the 
25 basis point spread that has prevailed on average since 2001. 
After having held production r oughly steady over the first half of this year, homebuilders 
are once again making significant cuts.  Single-family housing starts moved down 
another 7 percent in October, to an annual rate of 884,000 units, following a 17 percent 
decline in the June-to-September period.  Meanwhile, adjusted single-family permit 
issuance—generally a useful indicator of future star ts—continued along the steep 
downward trajectory that bega n about two years ago.  Yet, because of sagging sales, 
builders are making only limited progress at pa ring down their bloated inventories.  In 
October, the months’ supply of unsold new homes remained above eight months, nearly twice as high as the upper end of the fairly  tight range that it ha d occupied between 1997 
and the summer of 2005.
3  Meanwhile, multifamily starts rebounded in October from an 
unusually low reading in September, and the level of multifamily starts in October was near the midpoint of the range in which this series has fluctuated ove r the past ten years.

Home prices have continued to decelerate in  the second half of th e year.  The purchase-
only version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by the Offi ce of Federal Housing 
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased at a 1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, 
the first nominal de cline since 1993.  Through the four  quarters ending in the third 
quarter, this index increased 1.8 percent.  The ten-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-
sales price index—which is more heavily co ncentrated in urban areas that had seen 
greater appreciation in earlier years—s howed a decline of 5½ percent over the 
twelve-month period ending in September.  The average price of existing homes sold—
which is available on a more timely basis than other measures but reflects shifts in the 
mix of homes sold—fell 4½ percent in October re lative to year-earlier readings.  In the 
market for new homes, the constant-quality i ndex of new home prices fell at a 3 percent 
annual rate in the third quarter, bringing the index below its year-ear lier level for the first 
time since 1992.  This decline is consistent  with mounting anecdotal evidence that many 
large homebuilders are resorting to price disc ounts, in addition to nonprice incentives, to 
bolster sales and unload inventory. 
Equipment and Software  
Real equipment and software spending posted a solid increase at an annual rate of 
7¼ percent in the third quarter.  However,  orders and shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft declined in October, suggesting some deceleration in spending is 
under way this quarter.  Financial market deve lopments have also been unfavorable, as 
financing costs have risen for lower-rated borrowers, and increasing financial market 
stress may make firms more reticent to invest. 
The decline in orders and shipments in October was led by weakness in the high-
technology sector.  Shipments of  computers and peripheral e quipment declined while IP 
for computers—a less volatile indicator—was fl at in October.  Orders and shipments of 
communications equipment plunged in Oct ober.  Temporary pr oduction disruptions 
stemming from the recent wildfires in sout hern California likely contributed to the 
October weakness in shipments, alth ough spending cutbacks by large financial 
institutions affected by recent market turmoil may have contributed as well. 
For transportation equipment, purchases of me dium and heavy trucks have changed little 
in recent months, and demand for these vehicl es appears to have st abilized at a modest 
level.  Orders for trucks moved back up in October, after dropping sharply in August and 
September, suggesting that sales will remain ne ar their current levels  in coming months.

II-21 
Business spending on equipment outside of hi gh-tech and transpor tation posted a second 
consecutive quarter of brisk growth over the summer.  More recently, while orders in this 
broad category rose in Oct ober, shipments were about fl at, pointing toward weaker 
growth in the current quarter. 
Prominent surveys of current business conditi ons, such as the IS M and Philadelphia Fed 
manufacturing diffusion indexes, remain consis tent with modest gains in equipment and 
software spending this quarter.  Other survey s, however, are less sanguine.  The diffusion 
indexes of six-month-ahead capital spending plans from the Philadelphia Fed and Empire 
State manufacturing surveys (not shown) poste d notable declines in November.  And, in 
the latest Duke University/CFO magazine  Business Outlook survey, CFO optimism about 
their firms and the economy declin ed from already-low levels.   
Financial market developments since the time  of the last FOMC meeting have not been 
favorable to business spending on equipment and software.  While the cost of capital was 
little changed for borrowers in the investment grade co rporate bond market, financing 
costs for borrowers in the hi gh-yield corporate bond market are up significantly.  Spreads 
over Treasury yields were up across the boa rd, reflecting heightened uncertainty and 
turbulence in financial markets, which may act  as a restraint on spending.  In addition, 
recently released data indicate that corporat e cash flow dropped off in the third quarter, 
leaving firms with diminished  internally generated funds  for financing investment. 
Nonresidential Construction 
Available data through October suggest that  nonresidential building activity remained 
vigorous early this quarter following an averag e annualized gain of 13 percent in the first 
three quarters of the year.  However, the th ree-month moving average of the architectural 
billings diffusion index—which is reasonabl y well correlated with construction spending 
six months hence—has moved down in recent  months, suggesting so me deceleration of 
spending.  In addition, there are some indicatio ns that financial turm oil may be affecting 
activity in this sector.  Although commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are not 
an important source of new-construction fi nancing, the sharp c ontraction in CMBS 
issuance may signal a more general deterior ation in financing c onditions.  Along these 
lines, nonresidential construction contractor s indicate that funding has become more 
difficult to obtain in some cases, especially for speculative projects.  In addition, signs of 
decelerating commercial property values may reduce the pace of new construction going 
forward.

The BEA reported that real expenditures on drilling and mining structures jumped 
26 percent at an annual rate in the third quart er following an even la rger increase in the 
second quarter.  The magnitude of these repor ted increases is some what surprising given 
other indicators of activ ity in this sector, and the latest  available information points to a 
much more modest increase this quarter.4 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory investme nt excluding motor vehicles in creased at an annual rate 
of about $14 billion in the thir d quarter, slightly faster than  in the second quarter.  The 
only available Census data for the current  quarter are book-value estimates of the 
inventory investment of manufacturers in Oct ober, which were up at a similar pace to that 
of the third quarter. 
We do not see much evidence of inventory im balances.  The ratio of non-motor-vehicle 
book-value inventories to sales ticked up slightly in September but remained near the low 
end of the narrow range this ratio has occ upied since 2004.  Similarly, information from 
the staff’s flow-of-goods system suggests th at overall months’ supply of inventories 
excluding motor vehicles increased a little in October but remained in the range that it 
has occupied over the past year.  At a more  detailed level, the flow-of-goods estimates 
provide few indications of any serious inventory imbalances in the manufacturing sector.  
One area where months’ supply has moved up appreciably in recent months is construction supplies; months’ supply for th is category has increased steadily since the 
middle of this year.  Elevated months supply in  industries such as primary metals and, to 
a lesser extent, wood products, fabricated  metal products, and plastic and rubber 
products, are all likely tied to the ongoing w eakness in construction and motor vehicles. 
Federal Government Sector 
The federal unified budget defici t has leveled off since the spri ng, as the rate of growth of 
receipts has slowed markedl y.  October receipts were 6 pe rcent above their year-earlier 
level, but about half of th is gain reflected additional working days in October 2007.  
Much of the slowing in the rate of increase in receipts in recent months has reflected 
lower corporate income tax collections, whic h posted year-over-year declines in most 
months from May through October; daily da ta indicate that co rporate collections 
remained sluggish in November.  By contrast, increases in withheld payroll and income  
                                                
 
4  The BEA’s estimates reflect proprietary information th at is not available to the staff.  Nonetheless, the 
number of drilling rigs in operation and measures of footage drilled from the Department of Energy (not 
shown), moved up little, on balance, during the first two quarters and has remained flat thus far in the 
current quarter.

tax payments have been well maintained this fall.  Outlays (adjusted for payment timing 
shifts and financial transactions) rose 5 percent in October compared with their year-earlier level, a pace above that recorded earlier this year.  Notably, nominal defense 
spending in October rose 9½ percent from its  year-earlier levels , signaling moderate 
growth in NIPA real defense purchases in the current quarter, relativ e to the third quarter. 
In mid-November, the fiscal 2008 defense a ppropriations bill wa s enacted, providing a 
6½ percent increase over fiscal 2007 for regul ar appropriations.  The $196 billion in 
supplemental appropriations to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that was requested by the Administration remains in limbo.  Meanwhile, little progress was made 
on resolving differences between the Presid ent and the Congress on the level of funding 
for domestic programs, and another con tinuing resolution was passed to fund those 
programs through December 14.  Alternative mi nimum tax relief for tax year 2007 is still 
under discussion.  
State and Local Government Sector 
Real state and local purchases are off to a so lid start in the curren t quarter after having 
risen at an annual rate of 2 percent in the thir d quarter.  State and local employment 
increased sharply for the third month in a ro w in October after some sluggishness in late 
spring and early summer.  In addition, real construction spending seems to have retained 
considerable vigor in October after rising appreciably over the first three quarters of the 
year. 
Based on information from 43 states, the Rock efeller Institute of Government estimates 
that state tax collections increased 4½ pe rcent on a year-over-year basis in the third 
quarter of 2007, an increase similar to that  recorded over the preceding year but well 
below the hefty gains recorded in 2004 and 2005.  Personal income ta xes rose 6 percent 
on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter  of 2007 while sales taxes rose 2¾ percent 
and corporate income taxes fell 2½ percen t.  The incoming information from the 
individual states has been mixed.  For exampl e, revenues in states such as Alaska and 
Louisiana continue to perform well owi ng to the boost from high energy prices.  
Revenues in some other states, however, are be ing crimped by the downturn in real estate 
markets and the softness in retail sales.  In  California, the Legislative Analyst’s Office 
recently shaved 3 percentage points from its forecast of revenue growth in fiscal 2008 (which ends on June 30) and now expects the st ate to end the fiscal year with a negative 
balance in its general fund budget.  Simila rly, Florida recently lowered its revenue 
projection another notch and now expects revenues  to decline for a second year in fiscal 
2008.

Prices 
Top-line inflation has stepped up somewhat from  its low rates this summer.  After almost 
no change in August, total PCE prices in creased 0.3 percent both in September and 
October as the surge in crude oil prices has started to push up ener gy prices at the retail 
level.  Excluding food and energy, PCE price inflation has been moderate in recent 
months, although it has moved up from its very low rates this spring.  Still, on a twelve-
month change basis, core consumer price infl ation is down noticeably from a year earlier.  
Despite the increase in energy prices, longe r-term inflation e xpectations remain 
moderate. 
Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in both Se ptember and October.  The increase in core 
PCE prices over the past three months—2.3 perc ent at an annual rate—is up from a low 
of 1.2 percent over the three months ending in May.  The pickup in core PCE price 
inflation over this period reflects acceleration in the prices of items that were unusually 
soft last spring—including apparel, prescr iption drugs, medical services, and nonmarket 
prices.5  On balance, core PCE prices rose 1.9 percent over the twelve  months ending in 
October, down from a 2.4 pe rcent increase a year  earlier; both the nonmarket and market-
based components of these prices registered decelerations over this period.  Core goods 
prices have fallen noticeably ove r the past year following litt le change a year earlier.  
Within the services component, owners’ equi valent rent (OER) has decelerated sharply 
over the past year, though increases in tena nts’ rent have remained about the same.6 
Consumer energy prices increa sed 1.5 percent in October af ter edging up in September.  
Natural gas rates moved up after falling for six consecutive months , electricity rates 
jumped, and gasoline prices increased 1.6 percent.  Based on recent survey data, gasoline prices appear to have increased  considerably further in Nove mber.  Still, those increases 
have not matched the rise in crude oil costs, and gasoline margins have  fallen to relatively 
low levels.  The return to more normal margin s is likely to put further upward pressure on 
retail gasoline prices thr ough the end of this year. 
Consumer food prices rose 0.3 percent in Oc tober, down slightly from the 0.4 percent 
increases in both August and Sept ember but still above the increas e in core prices.  After  
                                                
 
5 After an upward revision to the nonmarket component of core PCE prices, the unusually large gap that 
had emerged between core CPI and core PCE inflation is now much narrower.  As expected, the gap was a transitory phenomenon.  For the six months ending in October, core CPI prices increased 2.3 percent at an annual rate, compared with a 1.9 percent increas e in core PCE prices; such a gap is typical. 
6 The divergence of tenants’ rent and OER inflation over the past twelve months does not appear to be the 
result of the utilities adjustment that the BLS makes to OER; rather, it appears to imply that rents increased 
more rapidly in regions with a large proportion of renters.

months of substantial price in creases related to the high cost  of feeds, the indexes for 
beef, poultry, and eggs fell in October, and the price of milk rema ined unchanged.  Over 
the twelve months ending in October, the PCE price index for f ood and beverages rose 
more than 4 percent, a sizable step-up fr om the 2.5 percent incr ease over the previous 
twelve-month period.  In commodity markets, grain prices have moved higher since the 
October Greenbook, reflecting strong expor t demand and tight world supply; in 
particular, corn and wheat prices have rebounde d to their highs of earlier this year, and 
soybean prices have shot up as well.   
Broader measures of inflation have stepped down from the levels observed over the past 
few years.  In the third quarter, the fou r-quarter change in th e GDP price index was 
2.4 percent, down nearly ¾ percentage point from the increase over the preceding four quarters.  GDP prices excluding food and ener gy have also decelerated  over this period, 
reflecting the notable drop in core PCE infla tion as well as a significant step-down in the 
price increases for nonresidential stru ctures and residential investment.

In response to rising energy pr ices, the median expectation for year-ahead inflation, as 
measured by the Reuters/University of Mich igan Survey, increased 0.3 percentage point 
to 3.4 percent in November.  However, the survey’s measure of the median inflation expectation over the next five to ten years remains in the narrow range of the past few 
years.  Readings on inflation expectations over the next ten year s in the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters also have been  about unchanged.  Five-year inflation 
compensation derived from TIPs has changed l ittle over the intermeeting period; inflation 
compensation five to ten years ahead has also  changed little over th is period after having 
drifted up earlier this year.   
Outside the energy sector, price pressures at ea rlier stages of processing remain modest.  
The producer price index (PPI) for core in termediate materials rose 0.1 percent in 
October for a second month, and the twelve-month change in prices of core intermediate 
materials was only 1.9 percent, down from th e 5.7 percent increase posted over the year-
earlier period.  This pattern re flects, in part, a deceleration in  the prices of a wide variety 
of construction materials, such as cement and gypsum, as well as some metal products.  
Since the October Greenbook, spot industrial ma terials prices have moved down, led by a  
                                                
 
7 The deceleration in the construction deflators may be  somewhat overstated.  These deflators are derived 
from new home price indexes.  New home prices includ e land values as well as structures costs, and the 
statistical agencies’ attempts to strip out the land  component are probably no t adequate, because they 
assume that the average construction cost is a fixed fr action of the average sales price.  That said, the PPI 
for construction materials decelerated si gnificantly over the last four quarters.

drop in a wide range of metals prices.  The Journal of Commerce index of industrial 
materials has declined about 2 percen t since the October Greenbook, while the 
Commodity Research Bureau spot in dex is down about ½ percent.   
Labor Costs 
As is often the case, the recent readings  on labor costs have been mixed.  The 
employment cost index (ECI) for hourly compen sation of private industry workers rose at 
an annual rate of 3.1 percent over the three months ending in  September.  The twelve-
month change in the ECI was also 3.1 per cent, up only slightly from the increases 
observed in the past few years.   This stability in overall compensation inflation reflects a 
modest acceleration in the ECI fo r private wages and salaries th at has been largely offset 
by a deceleration in the ECI fo r benefits.  The deceleration in benefits costs reflects 
declines in employer contributions to re tirement and savings plans and workers’ 
compensation, while costs of health insurance in creased at about the same rate as a year 
earlier.   
After incorporating information from unemp loyment insurance records, compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector is now estimated to have increased at an annual 
rate of only 1 percent in the second quarte r, compared with the 4.4 percent estimate 
reported in the previous BLS re lease.  Compensation per hour is estimated to have risen 
at an annual rate of 4¼ percen t in the third quarter and is up 5¾ percent over the past 
year. 8  This four-quarter change is considerab ly above both the gain of 2¾ percent in the 
preceding four quarters and the increase in the ECI over the past year.  The biggest 
increases in compensation per hour were posted in  the fourth quarter of  last year and the 
first quarter of this year, and sizable end-of-year bonuses were reportedly a significant 
part of that surge.  Recent anecdotes from the financial sector suggest that bonuses will 
be much smaller this year. 
The increases in compensation per hour in the second and third quarters of this year were 
less than the rise in productivity, and unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector 
declined following notable increases in the prev ious three quarters.  In  all, unit labor costs 
are estimated to have moved up 3 percent from th e previous year as of the third quarter.   
                                                 
8 The 5¾ percent increase is overstated by about 0.4 percentage point as a result of the BEA’s estimates of 
wage accruals that are not yet fully incorporated in the published data.  After receiving final compensation 
data for the first quarter of this year, the BEA revise d downward its estimate of bonuses that accrued in the 
fourth quarter of last year.  However, because the BEA will not revise its fourth-quarter NIPA estimates 
until the next annual revision, the published levels of compensation per hour and unit labor costs for the 
fourth quarter of 2006 and onward will be overstated. As  a result, the current four-quarter changes in these 
series are overstated by 0.4 percentage point.

The markup of prices over unit labor costs has increased recently, although it is down 
from its peak in the middle of last year. 
According to the ECI, employer contributions for health insurance rose about 5 percent 
over the twelve months ending in September, similar to the increase over the preceding 
year.  Taken together, the avai lable indicators provide no evid ence that any major change 
in the rate of increase in health insurance costs is in the offing.  Private surveys suggest 
that overall premiums (that is, the shares  paid by both employers and employees) are 
rising in the neighborhood of 5 to 6 percent this year a nd will likely continue to go up at 
about this rate in 2008.  Among the major pl ans for public employees, premiums in the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program ar e expected to rise 2 percent in 2008 after a 
slightly smaller increase in 2007.  The prem iums for the California Public Employees’ 
Retirement System are expected to move up 7 percent in 2008 after a 12 percent increase 
in 2007.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Financial market conditions deteriorated over the intermeeting period amid concerns 
about mounting write-downs by financial institu tions on mortgage-related securities and 
other exposures as well as sl owing economic growth.  Concerns  about the availability of 
funding over the year-end both contributed to and were reinforced by growing strains in 
short-term funding markets.  Market participants place high odds on a rate cut at the 
December meeting, although options quotes sugge st that participants are uncertain 
whether it will be a 25 or 50 basis point reduction.  Further ahead, the expected path of policy bottoms out just below 3 percent by the end of 2008, about 90 basis points lower 
than at the time of the October FOMC meeting.  Nominal Treasury yields dropped 
sharply, reflecting a lower expected policy path and likely safe-haven demands for 
Treasury securities.  Equity prices were volatile and declined on net, with financial stocks underperforming.  
Corporate bond spreads surged to their highe st levels since 2003.  Nonetheless, bond 
issuance was solid.  Banks reportedly continue d to take loans onto their balance sheets 
that had been intended for syndication.  Yield ratios in the municipa l bond market spiked 
on investor concerns about th e financial health of bond insu rers and possibly the fiscal 
outlooks for state and local governments.  Delinquency rates on subprime mortgages 
climbed further, and those on prime mortgages and other non-mortgage consumer loans also worsened a touch.  Issuance of secu rities backed by nonconforming residential 
mortgages continued to shrink, and spreads on jumbo mortgages over their conforming 
counterparts climbed a bit higher.       
 Money Market Functioning 
Conditions in short-term funding markets deteriorated in recent  weeks.  Spreads of rates 
on term federal funds and on libor over thos e on comparable-matur ity overnight index 
swaps widened appreciably, in some cases exceeding their early-September levels.  
Spreads on thirty-day interbank loans rose particularly sharply after their maturities crossed year-end.  These developments were repo rtedly driven, in part, by the desire of 
financial institutions to hold safer assets on their balance sheets over year-end, as well as 
increased precautionary demand by banks to secure year-end funding related to uncertainties about bank balance shee ts and counterparty credit risk.  Spreads on asset-
backed commercial paper, as well as those on lower-rated nonfinancial unsecured paper, also rose from already-elevated levels.  St aff estimates indicate that issuers of asset-
backed commercial paper and A2/P2-rated unsecured nonfinancial  paper are paying a 
premium of roughly 55 to 80 basis points to ob tain funding over year-end.  Asset-backed

commercial paper outstanding continued to de cline, while the outstanding amount of 
unsecured paper increased.  
 Treasury bill yields declined 30 to 90 ba sis points over the intermeeting period, likely 
because of lower policy expectations as well as  safe-haven demands that were related, in 
part, to the year-end statement date.  Inflows into money market mutual funds that hold only Treasury securities have been heavy in r ecent weeks.  Liquidity in the bill market 
remained poor, with bid-asked spreads quoted  at several times their normal levels.  
General collateral repo rates tr aded well below the overnight funds rate for much of the 
period, reflecting heightened demand for Treasur y securities, especially over the turn of 
the year.     
 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Investor expectations regardi ng the path of monetary policy shifted considerably lower 
over the intermeeting period, largely in response to events in credit markets and concerns 
about economic growth.  Economic data released  during the period were  generally a little 
weaker than expected, but the releases themse lves appeared to have  only a modest effect 
on the expected path for policy.    
 Monetary policy communications also had lim ited effects on interest rates.  The 
Committee’s decision to lower the target f unds rate 25 basis points at the October 
meeting was largely anticipated by investors.  However, the expected path of monetary policy shifted up a bit in res ponse to the Committee’s assessment that the upside risks to 
inflation roughly balanced the downside risk s to growth.  The expected policy path 
moved down somewhat in response to the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint Economic Committee in early November, as analysts focused on his remarks that economic activity was expected to slow in the fourth quarter.   The release of the minutes of the October 
FOMC meeting, including the Summary of Ec onomic Projections, sparked considerable 
discussion among analysts but elic ited little market reaction.   
 Quotes on binary options now indicate that market participants place about 35 percent 
odds on a 50 basis point rate cut, 60 per cent odds on a 25 basis point reduction, and

federal funds rate to decline to just be low 3 percent by the end of 2008.  Uncertainty 
about the future course of monetary policy rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, and 
the implied distribution of expected rates continued to be skew ed to the downside. 
 
Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities also declined notably over the intermeeting period and the yield curve steepened; the two- year yield dropped a bout 95 basis points, 
and the ten-year yield fell about 45 basis point s.  Yields on inflati on-indexed securities 
generally moved in line with their nominal counterparts, and both medium- and longer-term inflation compensation were little change d.  However, survey measures of inflation 
expectations edged higher.  Staff models of the term structur e suggest that the decline in 
real yields over the intermeeting period was due  to declines in exp ected real short rates 
and term premiums, broadly consistent with investors’ apparently more pessimistic economic outlook as well as some special demand for Treasury securities.   
 
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad stock price indexes dropped about 5 percent over the intermeeting period on 
mounting concerns about the health of financial institutions and slowing economic 
growth.  The decline was broad-based, but fina ncial stocks continued to underperform.  
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 rose to the upper end of its range over the past 
several months.  The spread between the tw elve-month forward tre nd-earnings-price ratio 
for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treas ury yield—a rough gauge of the equity 
premium—widened.     Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting 
period, while those on speculative-grade bonds in creased.  With Treasury yields falling, 
spreads on investment- and speculative-grade  corporate bonds shot up to their highest 
levels since 2003.  The run-up in spreads refl ects increases in bot h near- and far-term 
forward spreads, suggesting greater concer ns about near-term credit quality and 
heightened aversion to risk.    
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 fi rms in the third quarter came in about 
4 percent below year-ago levels and, on a s easonally adjusted basis, about 10 percent 
below levels in the prior quarter.  Profit d eclines were concentrated in the financial 
sector, where earnings plummeted almost 30 pe rcent from year-ago levels.  In contrast, 
nonfinancial firms posted four-quarter gains of about 4 percent.  The deceleration in 
NIPA profits in the third quart er was less pronounced, reflecting the fact that write-offs

have no effect on this measure of profits.  Looking ahead, an alysts’ revisions to year-
ahead earnings for the S&P 500 as a w hole were negative through mid-November, 
although when excluding financial firms, ear nings projections were  about unchanged.   
 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms app eared solid through October.  Preliminary 
data for large corporations in the third quarter indicate that aggregate leverage stayed low 
and that balance sheet liquidity remained  high by historical standards.  Rating 
downgrades on corporate bonds we re modest again in October, and the realized six-
month trailing bond default rate remained near  zero.  Third-quarter Call Reports showed 
that the delinquency rate on C&I loans also remained low.  The KMV-based aggregate 
year-ahead expected default rate bumped up again in October but was still low by 
historical standards.  
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial  corporations was 
solid in November but below its brisk October pace.  Meanwhile, outstanding 
nonfinancial commercial paper rebounded afte r three consecutive months of decline.   
C&I loans rose, on net, especially late in  the period, when banks reportedly resumed 
bringing onto their balance sheets previously committed loans that were intended for syndication.   Overall, net debt financing picked up  a bit in November  from its already 
torrid rate in October.  The pace of initial equity offerings by nonfinan cial corporations increased in November 
from moderate levels, while seasoned offerings surged in a range of industries.  Equity 
retirements likely continued to dwarf issuan ce in the third quarter, as repurchases are 
estimated to have ebbed only slightly from  their record second-quarter rate, and 
retirements from cash-financed mergers and acq uisition set a new record.  So far in the 
fourth quarter, mergers and acquisitions are on track to set another record, boosted by a 
few large LBOs.  In addition, the pipeline of  pending deals is large, and the pace of 
announcements of small- and middle-market M&A deals has been robust.  Announcements of new share repurchase program s have slowed somewhat in the fourth 
quarter but remain sizable.    
Commercial Real Estate 
Spreads of yields on commercial-mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) rated AAA and 
BBB over those on comparable-maturity Treasu ries jumped to about 200 and 700 basis 
points, respectively, reportedly reflecting mounting concerns about high levels of

leverage on recently securitized commercial mortgages, as well as persistent worries 
about structured financial products in gene ral.  Through October,  interest rates on 
commercial mortgages originated for securiti zation remained at the high end of their 
range over the past several years.     Originations data and the issuance calenda r point to a marked slowing of CMBS 
offerings in the fourth quarter, likely reflecti ng both the higher cost of capital in recent 
months and tighter underwriting standards.  Originators of commercial mortgages for 
CMBS pools have gradually responded to conc erns of investors and rating agencies by 
reducing leverage on newly originated mo rtgages, although such loans do not yet 
constitute a substantial sh are of new CMBS pools.   
 The volume of commercial real estate transa ctions typically funded from sources other 
than CMBS remained solid in the third quart er.  In contrast, the pace of transactions 
typically funded by CMBS was substantially below the outsized pace in the first half of this year.  The ratio of net operating income to commercia l property prices dec lined further in the 
third quarter, narrowing the spread  of this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a 
rough measure of the risk premium on commercial real estate assets.  However, commercial real estate pri ce appreciation has reportedly  slowed more recently.  
Delinquency rates on CMBS and commercial real estate loans at banks and life insurance 
companies ticked up in the third quarter but re mained at the low end of their historical 
ranges.      
Household Finance 
Growth of residential mortgage debt continue d to slow in the third quarter amid further 
weakening in the housing market.  Meanwhile , nonmortgage consumer credit grew at 
about its average pace of the past few years.  Mortgage interest rates for both thirty-year 
fixed-rate mortgages and one-year adju stable-rate conforming loans edged down, 
whereas spreads to Treasuries  rose.  Indicative quotes on thirty-year jumbo-mortgage 
rates rose over the intermeeting period to a bit above their September highs.       
     
Delinquency rates on subprime mortgages contin ued to increase.  In October, those on 
variable-rate and fixed-rate subprime mortga ges reached about 19 percent and 7 percent, 
respectively, about 310 and 75 basis points a bove their August levels.  Delinquency rates 
on variable-rate prime mortgages ticked up in September, whereas those on fixed-rate

prime mortgages were about flat at low levels.  Delinquency rates on nonmortgage 
consumer credit generally edged up further duri ng the third quarter to about their average 
levels over the past several years.  Fina lly, household bankruptcy filings (not shown) 
continued their slow upward trend following the bankruptcy reforms of 2005.     
 The available evidence suggests that the issuance of nonconf orming residential-
mortgage-backed securities was paltry in Nove mber.  In contrast, issuance of conforming 
residential MBS has been robust.  Consumer  auto and credit card asset-backed issuance 
also remained solid despite elevated spreads.   In the third quarter, OFHEO’s purchase-only h ouse price index posted its first decline in 
more than a decade.  Futures markets on hous e prices, although not very liquid, suggest 
that investors expect declines through the mi ddle of 2008 in each of th e ten large cities in 
the Case-Shiller index.  Falling house prices, along  with essentially flat stock prices in the 
third quarter, held down the ratio of househol d net worth to disposable personal income.  
Net withdrawals from domestic equity mutu al funds continued in November, whereas 
international equity funds and domestic a nd international bond f unds saw further net 
inflows. 
 
Treasury and Agency Finance  
Treasury auctions of two-, five-, ten-, a nd thirty-year nominal bonds this intermeeting 
period were well received, and demand at three-  and six-month bill auctions was on the 
high end of ranges seen over the past severa l years.  Foreign custody holdings at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York were about  flat.  The spread between the on-the-run 
and a smoothed off-the-run ten-ye ar Treasury yields rose noticeably to levels last seen in 
2003, but the two-year premium remained low.  Liquidity of on-the- run Treasury issues 
generally remained strong.  Bid-asked spr eads increased, but only to modestly higher 
levels.       
 Yield spreads of agency debt over comparab le-maturity Treasuries increased sharply 
through mid-November but are up only a bit on balance over the in termeeting period.  
Agency share prices plummeted about 40 perc ent.  Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
posted large losses for the third quarter as a result of rising defau lts on mortgages that 
they guarantee as well as losse s on their portfo lios of agency and private-label mortgage-
backed securities.  Over the intermeeti ng period, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac raised 
their guarantee fees and tightened their underw riting standards slight ly.  In addition,

State and Local Government Finance 
Issuance of long-term municipa l bonds for new capital and advance refundings slowed in 
November, albeit to a still solid rate, amid ri sing yield ratios to Treasuries.  In recent 
weeks, several municipal bond deals were pulle d from the market, reportedly because of 
price volatility that was associated with m ounting investor concerns about the soundness 
of financial guarantors.  Short-term issuance also slowed in November.  
 
Municipal-bond credit quality showed some signs of weakening in recent months.  The number of rating downgrades substantially outpaced the number of upgrades in October 
and November combined.  Downgrades were mainly on revenue bonds for projects insured by a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, which was itself recently downgraded.   
Meanwhile, the ratio of m unicipal bond yields to t hose on comparable-maturity 
Treasuries spiked to the top end of its hist orical range.  The ratio increased more for 
insured municipal bonds but also rose for si milarly rated uninsured bonds, suggesting that 
investors may have become concerned about both financial guarantors and the fiscal 
outlooks for state and local governments.  Premiums on credit default swaps for the major bond insurers widened dramatically to distressed levels in early November and 
remained high.     
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded moderately in November.  A lthough liquid deposits continued to grow 
slowly, M2 growth was supported by a surge in retail money funds that likely reflected 
safe-haven flows. The growth of small time  deposits was solid in November, as some 
depository institutions apparently continued to  offer higher rates on retail deposits to raise 
funds.  An ongoing shift in demand overseas away from U.S. dollar banknotes toward the 
euro and other currencies likely continued to  limit the growth in this component of M2. 
 Growth of commercial bank credit slowed ove r the intermeeting period from its torrid 
pace in September and early October.  C&I loans decelerated considerably from the 
soaring pace seen earlier in the fall, but growth remained strong, as some previously 
committed large syndicated loan deals repor tedly continued to make their way onto 
banks’ balance sheets.  While the pipeline of  such deals has diminished somewhat, the 
level remains substantial.  Spreads on syndica ted loans have increased notably since late 
summer.  The November Survey of Terms of Business Lending suggests that spreads of

rates on a broad sample of bank loans to bus inesses over Eurodollar and swap rates of 
comparable maturity were about unchanged on average from the previous survey, which 
was conducted in early August.  Growth of residential mortgages on banks’ books 
dropped in recent weeks, likely reflecting, in part, ongoing tightening of lending 
standards in that sector and weaker dema nd.  Nonrevolving consumer loans were about 
flat over the past two months.  By contrast , sources of revolving credit for consumers—
both home equity loans and credit ca rds—grew briskly during November. 
 According to the third-quarter Call Reports, pr ofits declined significantly at the largest 
banks, driven by a precipitous drop in noninterest income and the highest rate of loss provisioning since 2003.  The decrease in profits along with ba lance sheet growth 
contributed to declines in re gulatory leverage ratios at seve ral of the largest commercial 
banks.  Profits of smaller banks were about  unchanged from the second quarter.  Loan 
delinquency rates rose in the third quarter, in larg e part reflecting de terioration in the 
performance of residential mortgages and construction and land development loans, 
which include loans to residential developers.

In September, the value of exports of goods  and services increased 1.1 percent following 
a 0.7 percent increase in August.  The Septem ber gain primarily reflected higher exports 
of goods, with exports of agricultural products exhibiting part icularly robust growth on 
both higher prices and greater  volumes.  Exports of indus trial supplies and consumer 
goods also moved up smartly in September, while exports of automotive products were 
flat.  In contrast, exports of capital goods fe ll, led by a decline in aircraft.  Services 
exports recorded moderate growth.  
 
For the third quarter as a whole, the value of exports increased 22.8 percent at an annual 
rate.  The strength of exports was widely di stributed across categories, with exports of 
agricultural goods, aircraft, and i ndustrial supplies recording particularly strong growth.  
Exports of other capital goods, automotive pr oducts, consumer goods, and services also 
climbed robustly.  In contrast, exports of semiconductors fell.

The value of imported goods and services rose  0.6 percent in Sept ember after decreasing 
0.7 percent in August.  The increase in impor ts primarily reflected higher imports of 
capital goods, with imports of computers s howing particularly robust growth.  Higher 
imports of automotive products, consumer goods , and services also contributed to the 
increase.  However, imports of petroleum were flat, and imports of industrial supplies 
fell.     
 
The value of imports increased 11.2 percent (a.r .) in the third quart er.  The increase in 
imports was widespread, with imports of automotive products, petroleum products, and 
capital goods showing the largest increases.  Imports of c onsumer goods and services also 
rose, whereas imports of computers and indus trial supplies declined in the quarter.   
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In October, prices for U.S. import s of core goods rose  0.5 percent after 
being unchanged in September.  Prices for material-intensive goods jumped more than 
1 percent after falling in the previous month.  Food price in creases continued at a very 
strong pace, with sharp increases in prices of imported fruit.  Prices for nonfuel industrial 
supplies rebounded after a dip in September, with most of this pattern accounted for by 
metals.  Prices for imported finished goods rose 0.2 percent, led by higher prices for 
imported autos.  Outside of core goods, prices for imported computers and semiconductors both declined fo r the second consecutive month. 
 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose  7 percent in October, after a 4.6 percent 
increase in September.  Oil prices continued to rise in November, with the spot price of 
West Texas intermediate (W TI) crude oil reaching a record high of just under $100 per 
barrel in mid-month.  The rise in oil prices ov er this period appeared to reflect heightened 
supply concerns.  By December 4, the spot pr ice of WTI had fallen back to $88 per barrel 
amid concerns about economic growth in the United States.  Futures prices for delivery 
beyond the near term, however, have moved up appreciably; the pr ice of the December 
2015 contract has moved up about $10 sin ce the time of the October Greenbook, to 
$87 per barrel. 
 
Exports.   In October, prices for U.S. exports of core goods rose 1 percent after rising 
0.4 percent in September.  Prices for mate rial-intensive goods surged for the second 
consecutive month.  Sharply high er prices for exported grains  boosted prices for exported 
agricultural products, which rose about 4 percent in ea ch of the last two months.  Prices 
for nonagricultural industrial supplies also increased, with prices for exported fuels

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
The apparent impact of the recent financial market turmoil on U.S. financial flows 
continued in Septem
ber, with net flows into U.S. securities by foreign private investors 
remaining extremely weak (line 4 of the Su mmary of U.S. International Transactions 
table).  In October, however, net inflows strengthened appreciabl y, approaching a pace 
frequently seen in the months prior to the turmoil (top-left panel of the chart on Private 
Security Flows).  The September weakness extend ed to all types of U.S. securities, while 
the higher October flows reflected a large incr ease in the demand for U.S. Treasuries and 
stocks.  After surging in Augus t, net foreign private purchases  of U.S. Treasury securities 
(line 4a) fell to $4 billion in September before bouncing back to an unprecedented level of $47 billion in October, as foreign investors on ce again turned to relatively safe assets.  
Foreign demand for corporate and municipal bon ds picked up a bit to small net inflows 
totaling $4 billion (line 4c) in September a nd $7 billion in Octobe r, after two unusual 
months in which there were net outflows.  We note that this weak demand coincided with 
unusually low issuance of U.S. corporate bonds in recent months, about half the pace of 
issuance recorded in the first half of the y ear.  Foreign net inflows into U.S. corporate 
stocks were modest in September, totaling $3 billion (line 4d), but rose considerably in 
October to $33 billion.  Net outflows from  agency bonds continued, totaling $6 billion 
(line 4b) in September and $3 billion in October.  
  After unusual outflows in August, flows from fo reign official investor s returned to a net 
inflow of $10 billion (line 1) in Septembe r and $41 billion in Oct ober, approaching the 
pace observ
ed in the first half of 2007 (top-le ft panel of the chart on Foreign Official 
Financial Flows).   
 
 
.   
 U.S. transactions in foreign securities appear to have been less affected by the turm
 oil.   
U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities were strong in September, totaling $47 billion 
(line 5), but fell to $6 billion in October.  Demand was pa rticularly weak for foreign 
stocks in October, as U.S. investors sold foreign stocks, on net.  However, such large 

IV-8 
inter-month swings are not unusual (bottom-left  panel of the chart on Private Security 
Flows).   
 
Flows through the banking sector remained vola tile with an extraordinarily large outflow 
totaling $86 billion in August, followed by sm aller, but sizable, outflows in September 
and October. 
 
Combining all the monthly recorded flows, for both official and private transactions, 
yields a net outflow of $93 bill ion for the third quarter, even  as the current account deficit 
-- which requires capital inflows to finance it  -- is estimated at about $185 billion.  Note 
that the monthly recorded capital flows do not include some transactions, which are recorded only quarterly.  For example, it is likely that in the third quarter many foreign 
parents provided additional financial support to  their U.S. affiliates to replace funding 
which until recently had been raised in th e commercial paper market.  These types of 
inflows, which are estimated with the quarter ly direct investment data (and included in 
line 10), would help close the apparent gap between the current account and the flows that finance it.  The additional flows need ed to close this gap would, however, be 
unprecedented; thus, a sizable third-quarter st atistical discrepancy may be required to 
reconcile the internationa l transactions accounts.

Foreign Financial Markets  
 
Renewed concerns about weak earnings a nd potential asset write-downs at banks 
weighed on sentiment in global financial markets over the intermeeting period and 
prompted a widespread pull-back from risky positions.  Equity prices fell substantially 
across the globe, and risk spreads and implie d volatilities on a wide  range of assets 
increased.  Conditions in European interb ank money markets, which had shown some 
evidence of improvement in late October and early November, deteriorated in recent weeks.  Market liquidity remained strained at all but the shortest maturities.  Spreads 
between 3-month interbank offer rates and overnight index swaps (OIS ), an indicator of 
credit concerns in the term-money market , rose more than 50 and 30 basis points 
respectively in sterling and euro over the in termeeting period.  Spreads between 1-month 
interbank offer rates and OIS jumped as the maturity of those contracts passed year end, 
signaling notable funding pressures as banks  seek to secure funding through the new 
year.  Commensurate with the strains in term  money markets, the bid-ask spread in the 
FX swap market widened and the average size of trades diminished.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England, like the Federal Reserve, pledged to provide 
additional money market liquidity to counter  rising funding costs around the end of the 
year.   
 
The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar, which dropped sharply in the days 
leading up to the October FOMC meeting, has increased about ¾ percent over the 
intermeeting period.  The dollar depreciated about 1½ percent against the euro and  
4 percent against the yen.  The dollar also de preciated against the Ca nadian dollar early in 
the intermeeting period, but has more than re versed its course amid concerns about 
slowing economic growth in Canada.  On net,  the dollar appreciated 7 percent against the 
Canadian dollar over the period.  On Decem ber 4, the Bank of Canada announced a 
25 basis point cut in its targ et for the overnight rate to 4¼ percent , citing lower inflation 
projections, competitive pressures related to the stronger Canadian dollar, and concerns 
that effects on Canada from the U.S. sub-pr ime crisis will last longer than previously 
anticipated .  
 
Global equity markets have fallen sharply on ne t since late October.  Major indexes in 
Europe, Japan, and North America dropped 5 to 8 percent.  Financial stocks have been 
particularly hard hit, except in Japan, whic h is believed to have only limited exposure to 
the U.S. subprime-mortgage sector.  However, in recent days stock indexes have reversed 
some of their declines.  Markets were buoyed by news that Citigroup will receive a 
IV-13 
capital infusion of $7.5 billion from Abu Dhab i Investment Authority, the world’s largest 
sovereign wealth fund, as well as by severa l Federal Reserve speech es interpreted as 
signaling a possible rate cut by the FOMC in December.  Implied volatilities on the major 
equity indexes continued to rise in November  amid renewed concerns about credit market 
conditions. Ten-year Europea n, Canadian, and Japanese nominal sovereign bond yields 
fell 10 to 45 basis points on net, as invest ors scaled back riskier positions.   
Consistent with the general movement towa rd less risky positions, the dollar appreciated 
1½ percen
t against the Brazilian real and 3 percent against the Mexican peso.  Most Latin 
American equity indexes dropped 3 to 7 perc ent.    EMBI+ spreads jumped 57 basis 
points for Mexico and 61 basis points for Brazil.   Asian equity indexes also declined 
substantially, including a 15 percent drop for the Shangha i composite index and a 6 
percent drop in Korea.  Th e dollar depreciated almost 1 percent against the Chinese 
renminbi.  The People’s Bank of China raised  the reserve requirement for banks 50 basis 
points to 13.5 percent on N ovember 13; the following day it was announced that China’s 
twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation had risen to 6.7 percent.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
 
Output growth picked up in the advanced  foreign economies in the third quarter but 
incoming data suggest that growth declined in the fourth quarter.  In Japan, real output 
rebounded in the third quarter, led by a strong performance of exports.  In the euro area, 
GDP growth returned to a solid  pace in the third quarter on th e back of a strong recovery 
in investment.  In Canada and the United Kingdom, output growth stepped down to a 
still-robust 3 percent, as rapid growth in im ports partly offset vigorous domestic demand. 
 
Indicators of fourth-quarter activity are le ss robust on balance.  Confidence indicators 
deteriorated in most major economies in the wa ke of the recent financial turmoil and have 
remained relatively weak.  In November, th e euro-area and U.K. purchasing managers 
indexes (PMI) for services were well below thei r level over the first half of the year but 
nevertheless continued to poi nt to a moderate expansi on.  However, labor market 
conditions have remained relatively strong, although in Canada private-sector job 
creation has stalled in recent months. 
 
Consumer price inflation picked  up in most of the advanced foreign economies in recent 
months.  In the euro area and the United Kingdom, the twelve-month rate of consumer 
price inflation rose markedly in October, pushed up by rapidly rising energy and food prices.  In Canada, following a substantial rise in September due to energy prices, 
headline inflation edged down in October a nd core inflation declined for a fourth 
consecutive month.  In Japan, headline inflation turned mildly positive in October.  
 
In Japan , real GDP expanded 2.6 percent (a.r.) in  the third quarter, following a sharp 
contraction in the second quarter.  The in crease in activity was mostly driven by the 
external sector, with net exports contributing 1.6 percentage points to growth.  Domestic 
demand, however, remained weak.  Private investment recovered somewhat from the 
steep decline in the second quarter, but invest ment growth was still well below its rate 
posted in recent years.  Similarly, consum ption growth remained sluggish as wages 
continued to fall.

Residential investment exerted a significant drag on growth in  the third quarter due to a 
recent rule that increases inspections of buildings to ensure that they meet earthquake 
resistance requirements.  Housing starts tu mbled as insufficient resources devoted to 
inspection and a lack of clarity in the law resu lted in bottlenecks in the review of building 
plans.  The government recently announced its intention to relax the law to ease the negative impacts on the construction sector.

Although the unemployment rate remained at 4 per cent in October, its le vel at the start of 
the year, the labor market shows some signs of weakening.  The job offers-to-applicants 
ratio (the number of official ly posted job openings relative to the number of officially 
registered job seekers) fell to 1.02 in Oct ober, from 1.05 in September.  One reason 
behind this weakening is that small- and me dium-sized companies, which experienced a 
deterioration in profitability recently, have  cut back employment.  Earnings growth 
moved further into negative territory, as to tal cash earnings (which include bonuses) fell 
1.3 percent in September from a year earlier. 
 
Pushed by higher oil prices, the nationwide co re consumer price index, which excludes 
fresh food only, rose 0.1 percent in the year to  October, the first su ch increase since last 
December, while the third-quarter GDP deflat or fell 0.3 percent from a year earlier.  
Excluding fresh food and energy, consumer prices continued to fall in October.

Euro-area  real GDP grew 2.9 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, a marked rebound from 
the second quarter, when poor weather de pressed construction spending.  The third-
quarter recovery was supported by robust pe rformances in France and Germany, and it 
was the result of a strong recove ry in domestic demand, particul arly in the rate of growth 
of investment.  Net exports subtracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth in the 
third quarter, as a surge in imports more  than offset an increase in exports.

Some signs of weakening growth emerged towa rds the end of the third quarter.  After 
growing 1.2 percent in August, industrial production fell 0.8 percent in September.  
Manufacturing new orders in Germany fell 2.5 percent in September from the previous 
month.  Growth in the volume of retail sales in the euro area edged up in September but 
declined 0.8 percent in October. 
 
Recent survey indicators have been mixed but, on balance, are consistent with some 
slowing in the pace of economic activity go ing into the fourth quarter.  Euro-area 
economic sentiment fell in November for the sixth consecutive month, although it remains well above its long-run average.  C onsumer confidence continued to decline and

service confidence fell markedly, outweighing some recovery in industrial confidence.  
Germany's IFO business climate index improved slightly in November, after six 
consecutive months of decline.  The euro-a rea services PMI fell in November while the 
manufacturing PMI rebounded unexp ectedly after four months of slippage.  Both series 
are near their lowest levels in more than tw o years.  In contrast to these indicators of 
softness, the euro-area unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent in November, the 
lowest rate since records began 15 years ago. 
 
The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation rose almost one percentage 
point over the course of October and November , reaching 3.0 percent, its highest level in 
six and a half years.  Whereas core infl ation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) 
edged up to 2.1 percent in October, energy pr ice inflation jumped from 3.0 percent in 
September to 5.5 percent in October, and unprocessed food price inflation rose from 
2.0 percent in September to 3.1 percent in Oct ober.  Although details are not yet available 
for November, preliminary indications from i ndividual countries suggest  that the rise in 
euro-area headline inflation that month was the result of further increases in food and 
energy prices. 
 
In the United Kingdom , real output grew 3.0 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, 
stimulated by strong domestic demand.  Consumption expanded 4.0 percent while business investment rebounded to 6.7 percen t.  Economic activity was particularly 
buoyant in the retail, financial intermediation, real estate renting, and business services 
sectors, but moderated in  the manufacturing sector. 
 
Recent data are consistent with a moderati on in the pace of economic growth in the 
fourth quarter.  Consumer and business conf idence indicators both slipped in November.  
The PMI for services weakened to 51.9 in October (above 50 indicates expansion), its 
lowest level in over four years, as firms were increasingly worried about their ability to 
attract new business.  The PMI for manufact uring firmed to 54.4 in November but the 
PMI for construction slid to 54.3.  A slowdown in the housing sector is under way.  Net 
mortgage lending fell 22.8 percen t in October from the prev ious month while the number 
of mortgages approved for house purchases decl ined 30 percent in the three months to 
October.  Most indicators of house prices ha ve shown some declin e in recent months.

The labor market continued to be solid.  The claims-based and Labor Force Survey 
measures of the unemployment rate were unchanged at 2.6 percent in October and 
5.4 percent in August, respectively.  Average earnings including bonuses rose 4.2 percent 
in the twelve months ending in August, while  unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector 
were little changed over the same period. 
 
Although wage pressure remains subdued, price pressure has incr eased in other sectors of 
the economy.  Producer output prices rose 3.8 per cent in the year to October, the fastest 
rate of increase in over a decade, as producers passed on higher prices of petroleum and 
food inputs.  The twelve-month rate of headline consumer price inflation rose 
0.3 percentage point to 2.1 per cent in October, standing above the central bank's target of 
2 percent for the first time since June.  Headline inflation was pushed up by the imposition of new environmental duties on gasolin e and by a rise in pr ice of several food 
items.

In Canada , GDP grew 2.9 percent in the third quarter, down from the 3.8 percent 
increase of the previous quarter.  Private consumption rose 3.0 percent, a slowdown from 
the rapid pace of the second quarter and well below its recent average growth rate of 
around 4 percent.  Imports outpaced exports by a wide margin, and inventories rose, 
contributing 3.4 percentage points to growth.  Fixed investment also expanded robustly, 
with machinery and equipment investment cont ributing almost a full percentage point to 
growth.  Structures, both residential and business, also made positive a contribution.

The housing market appears to have weakened sl ightly over the past couple of months.  
Single-unit housing starts declin ed in September and October.  The twelve-month change 
in house prices has slowed from a peak of 12 percent in 2006 to 6 percent in September.  
However, multi-unit starts have remained solid.  Total multi-unit starts from January 
through October are around 4 percent higher than they were in the comparable period in 
2006. 
 
October employment rose by a robust 63 thous and jobs, following a gain of 51 thousand 
jobs in September.  However, gains in employment continued to be concentrated in the public sector.  From January to October, private sector employ ment fell by 15 thousand 
jobs while public sector employment incr eased by 171 thousand jobs, compared with 
281 thousand and 8 thousand jobs, respect ively, over the same period in 2006.

In October, the twelve-month rate of consumer price infl ation ticked down to 2.4 percent 
(n.s.a.), following a sharp rise in September.   Core inflation, which excludes the eight 
most volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, slowed for the 
fourth month in a row, reaching 1.8 percent in  October.  Average hourly wages increased 
4.1 percent over the twelve-month period ending in September. 
 
On December 4, the Bank of Canada lowered its target for the overnight rate 25 basis 
points.  In a statement accompanying the announcement, the Bank cited lower inflation risks related to the level of the Canadian dollar, and greater downside risks to growth, 
associated with a weaker outlook for the U.S. economy, as the main reasons for the interest rate cut. 
 
Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Overall, growth in emerging Asia moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its double-digit pace in the second quarter, but re mained strong.  Economic growth was also 
solid in Latin America, largely reflecting st ronger-than-expected activity in Mexico.  The 
incoming data reinforce the view that the tu rmoil in financial markets has not had any 
significant negative impact on real economic activity in emerging market economies.  
Headline inflation rates have picked up in many developing countries , largely reflecting 
continued pressures from food and energy prices.  In particular, ve getable prices have 
accelerated in a number of countries.  In some cases, core inflation ra tes have also risen a 
bit. 
 
In China , real GDP growth slowed to 8¼ percent in the third quarter, according to staff 
estimates.  This reflected a narrowing of the trade surplus and a moderation in investment 
growth.  Incoming data for this quarter are mixed.  Exports, imports, and industrial 
production fell in October.  However, imports  fell more than exports, widening the trade 
surplus slightly from the previous month.  The twelve-month growth of investment and 
retail sales picked up in October. 
 
After moderating just a touch in September,  consumer price inflation was back up to 
6¾ percent for the twelve months ending in  October.  Food price increases again 
accounted for the acceleration in prices, with non-food price in flation remaining at a little 
over 1 percent.  The recent acceleration in food pr ices is attributable to a sharp pickup in 
vegetable prices, likely caused by floods in pa rts of the country.  Overturning its earlier 
announcement of a freeze in administered pr ices for the rest of the year, Chinese 
IV-31 
authorities recently announced an increase in  gasoline prices of about 10 percent in 
response to the sharp rise in world oil prices. 
 
Amid concerns about the rate of headline in flation and the failure of money growth and 
credit growth to moderate, the governme nt has issued fresh “window guidance” 
instructions to banks to freeze net lending for the rest of the year.  Specifically, banks 
have been asked to restrict the value of out standing loans at year-end to no greater than 
their level at the end of October.  Al though these requests are, strictly speaking, 
voluntary, most of the banks will likely make efforts to comply.

In Hong Kong, economic activity remains robust.  R eal GDP grew rapidly in the third 
quarter, albeit by less than the second quarter’s  torrid pace.  Activity  was buoyed in large 
part by private consumption.  Strong economic growth has put upward pressure on prices.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation jump ed to 3¼ percent in October, although part 
of the increase was a one-off expiration of a tax waiver.  Also in October, the trade deficit 
narrowed as exports increased more than imports.

In Taiwan , real GDP maintained its double-digit rate  of growth in the third quarter, with 
both domestic demand and the external se ctor supporting econo mic activity.  The 
unemployment rate has remained at around 3.9 pe rcent since the beginn ing of last year.  
In addition, industrial production continued to grow robustly in  October.  Inflation has 
begun to pick up, however, with twelve-mont h consumer price inflation jumping to 
around 5 percent in October and November.  A lthough the recent rise in consumer prices 
largely reflects the impact of typhoons on f ood prices, core infla tion has also begun to 
edge up.

In South Korea, real GDP expanded a solid 5½ percent in the third quarter, supported 
mainly by strong private consumption and, to  a lesser extent, net exports.  Consumer 
sentiment has remained strong so far in the fourth quarter, and the unemployment rate has 
continued to decline.  Industrial production rebounded in October from its decline in the 
previous month.  Twelve-month consumer pri ce inflation has picked up in recent months 
owing to a jump in vegetables prices resu lting from adverse weather conditions for the 
harvest.  The Bank of Korea left the policy ra te unchanged at 5 percent at its November 
meeting following two consecutive ¼ percentage  point increases in July and August, but 
has stated that it remains concerned about in flationary pressures a nd growth in lending.

In Singapore , third quarter real GDP growth fell to  4¼ percent after averaging 12 percent 
in the first half of the year.  Domestic demand, notably private consumption and fixed 
investment, contracted.  More recently, indus trial production has continued to decline, 
and the trade balance has edged down.  Howeve r, the most recent PMI readings suggest 
an expansion of activity going forward.  Afte r moderating a bit in September, twelve-
month consumer price inflation rose to a bout 3½ percent in Oc tober due mostly to 
increases in energy prices.

Indian  real GDP growth moderated to 8 percent in the third quarter, as further strong 
gains in services output were offset to some degree by a decline in manufacturing output 
after two quarters of double-digit growth.  Data from October point to a renewed 
widening of the trade deficit and a conti nued deceleration in twelve-month inflation, 
including for food prices.  Nonetheless, in flation pressures remain; the government has 
not altered ceilings on fuel pr ices since February, fiscal sp ending is surging, and capital 
inflows have been strong.  The Reserve Bank of India signaled that it remains concerned 
about inflation at its policy meeting in late  October by increasing its cash reserve ratio 
½ percentage point to 7½ percent and revi sing down its medium-term “guidance” rate of 
WPI inflation to 3 percent from a range of  4 to 4½ percent.  The government also 
indicated that it would continue  to intervene in exchange ma rkets, if necessary, to stem 
the rapid appreciation of the rupee.

Data from the ASEAN-4  indicate that economic growth generally picked up in the region 
in the third quarter.  Real GDP increased by more than 9 percent in Indonesia and 
Malaysia and 6¼ percent in Thailand.  However, real GDP growth in the Philippines 
slowed to just over 1 percent in the third quarter because of very weak exports of 
electronics, particularly to th e United States.  More recent data show that industrial 
production rose at a solid pace in Thailand in October.  Incoming trade data are mixed.  The trade deficit increased significantly in the Philippines in the third quarter and the trade surplus narrowed in Tha iland, but the trade surplus in Malaysia (an oil exporter) 
widened a bit.  In Indonesia, the trade surplu s increased in October,  after narrowing in the 
third quarter.  Consumer price inflation has generally continued to increase in the region in recent months, in part owing to food and oil price pressures.  The Bank of Indonesia, 
Bank Negara Malaysia, and the Bank of Tha iland kept their policy rates unchanged in 
their latest policy meetings.

In Mexico , real GDP rose at a stronger-than-expected  pace of nearly 6 percent in the third 
quarter.  Although manufacturing ac tivity showed some signs of softness, output in the 
services and construction sectors expanded vigorously.  In October, exports fell relative 
to the previous month.  The government announced plans for a massive $250 billion 
increase in infrastructure spending over the remainder of President Calderon’s term, with 
an initial 10 percent in crease in real expenditu res taking place in 2008. 
 
Twelve-month headline inflation remained hi gh at 3¾ percent in October.  Despite some 
moderation in agricultura l prices, core inflation readings  turned out to be higher than 
anticipated because of increases  in the prices of cigarettes  and milk.  In October, the 
Bank of Mexico (BOM) raised the benchmark overnight lending rate ¼ percentage point 
to 7½ percent.  The BOM last tightened policy in April.

In Brazil , data indicate continued expansion.  In October, i ndustrial production jumped 
2¾ percent, bringing twelve-mont h growth to nearly 10 percent.  Retail sales grew 
strongly in September, up about 9½ percent on a twelve-month basis.  Measures of 
capacity utilization have been high.  The trade balance narro wed in November, in part

In mid-November, the Brazilian government -controlled company, Petrobras, announced 
the discovery of a major oil field in the d eep waters of the Santos Basin.  The Tupi 
discovery is estimated to hold 5 to 8 billion barrels and represents a sharp increase in the 
country’s current proven reserves of 14 billi on barrels.  However, it will take several 
years before the oil field becomes operational.

In Argentina , indications are that activity continues to be strong.  The unemployment 
rate slid to 8.1 percent in the third qu arter, reaching a new low over the current 
expansion.  Industrial production grew more than  1 percent in Octobe r.  Reported twelve-
month consumer price inflation remained elev ated at nearly 8½ pe rcent.  (Allegations 
continue that Argentine authorities are tamper ing with the consumer price data.  Starting 
in December, INDEC will report a new updated basket for consumer prices.)  In the

In Venezuela , on December 2, in a surprise development, voters narrowly defeated 
President Hugo Chavez’s proposed constitutional reform.  The reform would have 
removed term limits, put the central bank unde r Chavez’s control, and greatly expanded 
other executive powers.  It was Chavez’s first defeat since he took power in 1998.  
Although Chavez accepted th e outcome, he indicated that hi s reform proposal was still on 
the table.  The economic repercussions of  the referendum result are unclear, but the 
outcome has boosted the mo rale of the opposition. 
 
Twelve-month inflation crossed the 20 percen t mark in November.  Fueled by very loose 
economic policies, real GDP rose an estimated 11½ percent in the thir d quarter, reflecting 
a 15½ percent increase in non-petroleum output.  In contrast, petroleum output contracted 
an estimated 9 percent for the second consecuti ve quarter.  In November, in response to 
the steep drop in the value of the bolivar in  the parallel market, the government issued 
dollar-denominated and dollar-linked bonds and announced that bond sales would continue until March 2008.  The dollar-de nominated bonds are attractive because the 
government allows investors to purchase them  using bolivars at the official exchange 
rate, which is considerably stronger than the exchange rate in the pa rallel market.

In Turkey, industrial production decreased nearly 3 percent in September because of a 
sharp decline in the food and metal manuf acturing components.  Twelve-month consumer 
price inflation increased to about 8½ percent in November , well above the central bank’s 
year-end target range of 4 per cent +/- 2 percent.  Nevertheless, at its November meeting, 
the central bank cut its benchmark overnight  borrowing and lending rates to 16¼ percent 
and 20¾ percent, respectively, while emphasizi ng that the current level of rates remains 
restrictive.  The Monetary Policy Committee in dicated that the lagged effects of previous 
monetary tightening coupled with weaker external demand should ease inflationary 
pressures.
