1 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will revise the March 2007 level of payroll employment in its 
January 2008 employment report.  Based on its preliminary estimate, we expect the BLS to revise down the 
level of private nonfarm payrolls about 200,000. Aggregate economic activity appears to ha ve decelerated sharply.  Notably, the 
contraction in homebuilding intensified in the fourth quarter and shows few signs of 
letting up.  Retail sales were weak in D ecember, perhaps reflecting the combined 
influence of rapidly rising energy prices , eroding housing and equity wealth, and 
depressed consumer sentiment.  The very-lim ited available information about auto sales 
in January suggests some softening from the reasonably steady pace of the preceding 
several months.  Sentiment appears to have soured on the business side as well, and 
industrial production contracted in  the fourth quarter.  Conditions  in the labor market also 
deteriorated noticeably near year-end, with private payroll employment posting a small 
decline in December and the unemployment rate rising sharply.  As for inflation, both headline and core measures have increased in  recent months.  The twelve-month change 
in overall consumer prices is up a good bit fr om its year-earlier levels because of higher 
price inflation for both food and energy; co re price inflation is roughly unchanged, on 
net, over that period. 
Labor Market Developments 
Hiring slowed to a trickle late last year.  After an increase of 87,000 in November, private 
nonfarm payrolls decreased 13,000 last month, as employment declined sharply in 
manufacturing, construction, and retail trade— the last of which reversed much of 
November’s outsized increase.  On average,  private nonfarm employment rose 37,000 in 
November and December, only about half of th e average pace seen from July to October, 
which had itself been a step-down from the gains in the first half of the year.
1  Over the 
year as a whole, the deterioration in labor demand was most pronounced in the 
construction and financial activities industries, which have been hardest hit by the difficulties in the housing and mortgage markets.   Nevertheless, the job cutbacks seen so 
far in the residential construction industry have been smaller than would be expected given the plunge in homebuilding. 
The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory worker s on private nonfarm 
payrolls held steady in December, at 33.8 hours; aggregate hours also were unchanged 
for the month.  In the fourth quarter, aggregate hours of private production or 
nonsupervisory workers rose at an  annual rate of  1.0 percent.

In the household survey, the unemployment ra te jumped to 5.0 percent in December, 
while the labor force participation rate held steady at 66.0 percent.  The unemployment 
rate moved up ½ percentage point from May to December.  In the past, increases of this magnitude have been associated with periods  of substantial and prolonged labor market 
weakness. 
Most other indicators of labor demand have al so weakened.  Initial and continuing claims 
for unemployment insurance moved higher in November and December, consistent with 
slowing employment growth.
2  Layoffs and discharges in  the Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover (JOLT) survey rose sharply between July and November, and higher  
unemployment among job losers accounted for about half of the increase in the overall 
jobless rate over the second half  of the year.  The most recent readings on net hiring plans 
from Manpower and the National Federation of  Independent Business (NFIB) point to a 
further slowdown in hiring.  In contrast to  these downbeat readi ngs, announcements of 
job cuts reported by Challenger, Gray, a nd Christmas continued to trend down through 
year-end. 
Other indicators of labor market tightness ha ve also pointed toward some softening of 
labor market conditions.  Unemployment exp ectations in the Reuters/University of 
Michigan Survey jumped in December and remained elevated in early January.  
Moreover, respondents to the Conference Board survey reported that job availability 
eroded further in December, and fewer small businesses in the NFIB survey reported 
                                                 
2 Initial claims have dropped back down in the last two weeks.  However, unem ployment insurance claims 
are very difficult to adjust for seasonal variation at this time of year, and thus we are not taking much signal 
from the recent declines.

having hard-to-fill positions.  In contrast, job vacancies as measured in the JOLT survey 
remained at a relatively hi gh level in November, although they have moved down in 
recent months toward the low end of the narr ow range that has prevailed since late 2005. 
Industrial Production  
Activity in the industrial sector has been stag nant, on balance, in recent months.  After 
posting widespread declines in October, industrial production (IP ) firmed a bit in 
November and held steady in December.  For the fourth quarter as a whole, IP declined at 
an annual rate of about 1 per cent, as a drag from motor ve hicles and construction-related 
industries more than offset a positive contribution from other industries.3  Manufacturing 
output declined at an annual rate of nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter, and the factory 
operating rate fell back to its long-run aver age.  In addition, se veral forward-looking 
indicators of manufacturing activity have de teriorated recently and suggest that the 
overall trajectory for IP will remain quite soft in the early part of this year.  Outside of 
manufacturing, utilities out put climbed for a second c onsecutive quarter, and mining 
output was bolstered by increases in natu ral gas extraction and in crude oil. 
The production of motor vehicles and parts fell  at an annual rate of 13 percent in the 
fourth quarter, subtracting about ¾ percentage point from the ra te of change in total IP.  
Assemblies of light vehicles declined to an  annual rate of 10¼ million units, down more 
than 400,000 units from the rate in the thir d quarter.  The recent cuts to production, 
coupled with the steady pace of light vehicle sales through the end of last year, helped bring inventories of all domestic manufacturer s down to comfortable levels; days’ supply 
for domestic light vehicles stood at 64 days at the end of December.  Nevertheless, with 
automakers projecting slower sales in 2008, their assembly plans call for production to 
edge down further in the first quarter, to a pace of 10.1 million units.  Elsewhere in transportation, commercial aircraft producti on climbed at an annual rate of about 
15 percent in the fourth quarter.  The ramping up of production of Boeing’s new 787 
Dreamliner should boost IP significantly in the first half of this year.

3 The previous two quarterly declines in total IP—in 2006:Q4 and 2003:Q2—were larger than last quarter's 
decrease but were relatively small comp ared with those in the past econom ic downturns.  In recessions, IP 
generally falls in conjunction with real GDP but by a much larger amount.  
4 Boeing recently announced another de lay of the initial delivery of the 78 7, citing start-up issues at its 
assembly plant and ongoing complications with several suppliers.  The announcement follows a November 
decision to push back delivery from mid- to late-2008.  In spite of these problems, the company still plans 
to complete roughly four 787s per month by the middle of the year.  However, these aircraft cannot be 
delivered until Boeing has received final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which now 
seems unlikely until early 2009.

Production in high-tech industries increased at an annual rate of 14.3 percent in the fourth 
quarter, a step-down from the third-quarter rate and somewhat below the average pace 
since 2003.  Although output of communications equipment picked up to a solid rate, 
production increases for both computers and semiconductors moderated in the fourth 
quarter.  The deceleration in semiconductor output has been broadly based.  For computers, preliminary data from the Intern ational Data Corporation indicate that PC 
sales only edged up in the fourth quarter. 
Available indicators suggest moderate gains for high-tech output during the next few 
months.  Intel’s guidance for the current qua rter points to little  change in nominal 
revenue from the fourth quarter and is cons istent with a moderate rise in real MPU 
production.  Domestic orders of  printed circuit boards declined in November from a 
relatively high level, but the book-to-bill ratio rema ined slightly above one, indicating 
that shipments and orders are roughly balan ced.  In addition, according to the latest 
NABE Industry Survey, high-tech  spending plans for the next twelve months picked up 
in the fourth quarter.  The improvement in  the diffusion index was widespread across 
industry groups; spending plans in the finance, insurance, and real es tate sector recovered 
some after dropping noticeably in the third quarter.  Outside of energy, motor vehicles and part s, and high-technology, production declined at 
an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter.  Among the major market groups, the 
index for construction supplies moved down in December for the sixth consecutive 
month.  Materials output decreased at an annua l rate of about 2 percent in the fourth 
quarter, with production likely curbed by w eak demand from the construction and motor 
vehicles sectors.  Elsewhere, the output of consumer goods increased in December but 
was down at an annual rate of n early 3 percent for th e quarter as a whole.  In contrast, the 
index for business equipment climbed further, due in large part to the ongoing strength of 
commercial aircraft production and to  apparent strength in export demand. 
The indicators of near-term manufacturing activity have deteriorated, on balance, since 
the December Greenbook and point to small d eclines in production in coming months.  
The ISM’s diffusion index of new orders dropped nearly 7 index points, to 45.7, in 
December—its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2001, when IP declined at an 
annual rate of about 5 percent.  In addition, the three-month moving average of the staff’s 
series on real adjusted durable goods orders  moved further into negative territory in 
November.  And although the new orders indexes from the regional manufacturing 
surveys were, on balance, above 50 in December,  the early readings for January from the 
Empire State, Philadelphia Business Outlook, and Richmond Federal Reserve surveys all

stood at or below 50.  Finally, the weekly physic al product data available for the first part 
of January have been about unchanged  from their levels in December.  
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of light vehicles averaged a moderate pace of 16.1 million units (annual rate) in the 
fourth quarter.   
.  Looking ahead, however, 
indicators of vehicle demand suggest a softer pace of sales in the near term.  Through the 
first twenty days of Januar y, the pace of sales at Toyot a, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda was 
nearly unchanged from December’s rate, but the major domestic firms are forecasting weaker sales.  More broadly, the gains in employment and real income have been weak 
recently, and the Reuters/Michigan index of car-buying attitudes remained near its 
historical low in early January. 
Consumer Spending 
The rise in real consumer spending appears to  have moderated in the fourth quarter.  For 
the retail control category of  goods, which excludes sales of auto dealers and building 
material and supply stores, monthly changes in nominal spending have been volatile, in 
part due to swings in sales at  gasoline stations.  Factoring in  our estimate of PCE prices, 
real spending in the retail c ontrol category rose weakly, on ne t, over the last three months 
of the year, consistent with the low readings  of consumer sentiment and industry reports 
of mediocre holiday sales.  After no change, on balance, in September and October, real 
outlays on services rose solidly in November  (the most recent month available), led by 
rebounds in energy services and commissions pa id to stock brokers.  However, warmer-
than-usual temperatures in December likely damped expenditures for energy services. 
The fundamental determinants of consumer spending have deteriorated recently.  Real 
disposable income posted a second monthly de cline in November, due mostly to higher 
consumer energy prices; with households adjusting only slowly to their reduced 
purchasing power, the personal saving rate fell  to -0.5 percent in November.  Also, the 
wealth-to-income ratio ticked down in the th ird quarter as house pr ices fell a touch, and 
available indicators point to co ntinued declines in house pric es in the fourth quarter.  
Furthermore, equity prices are down 14 per cent since the end of the third quarter and 
11 percent since the end of last year. 
The few available spending indicators for Janua ry have been soft; recent readings of 
weekly chain store sales point to just sm all gains, and anecdotal reports generally 
characterize spending as remaining weak this month.  Consumer sentiment, as measured

by the Reuters/University of Michigan and th e Conference Board surveys, held at low 
levels in December.  The preliminary reading of the Reuters/Michigan  index rose in early 
January but remains well below its level in mi dsummer.  The declin e in sentiment since 
July remains larger than we would have predicted given changes in inflation, stock 
prices, and employment conditions. 
Housing  
The contraction in residential construction st eepened in the second half of last year.  
Single-family housing starts moved down 3 percent in December to an annual rate of 
794,000 units, bringing the cumulative decline in  the second half of last year to 
31 percent and the decline since its peak in  the first quarter of  2006 to 53 percent.  
Adjusted single-family permit issuance—gene rally a useful indicator of current and 
future construction activity—also declined  noticeably in December.  Meanwhile, 
multifamily starts plunged in December, but th is series is volatile, and permit issuance 
points to a rebound in multifamily starts in the near term. 
The demand for new homes also seems to have weakened further in the last few months.  
The Census Bureau’s estimate of new home  sales dropped 9 percent in November after 
having held relatively steady si nce August.   
 
 
.5  In contrast, recent readings on the demand for 
existing homes have not been as bleak.  In particular, sales of existing single-family homes edged up 0.7 percent in November after holding steady in October.  In addition, 
the index of pending sales agreements—which tends to lead sales of existing single-family homes by one to two months—points to a December pace of sales that would 
leave existing home sales roughly flat in the fourth quarter.   
Tight financing conditions for nonprime and jumbo mortgages continued to restrain 
housing demand through the end of last year.  Available data suggest that issuance of 
securities backed by nonprime mortgages (which include the subprime and alt-A 
categories) slowed more than home sales in  the fourth quarter, suggesting that the

fraction of home sales financed with these types of mortgages has continued to trend 
down.  At the same time, data from the Federal Housing Finance Board’s Monthly 
Interest Rate Survey suggest that the share of  jumbo loans in prime mortgage originations 
was about 5½ percent from September to N ovember, about two-thirds of its average 
share since early 2006.  Spreads between ra tes for jumbo and conforming thirty-year 
fixed-rate mortgages also widened to 90 basi s points in December—about 65 basis points 
wider than the average spread between  2001 and mid-2007.  Although increased fees 
imposed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may ha ve tightened financing for borrowers at 
the margins of the prime category in the fourth quarter, interest rates faced by other prime borrowers moved down over the fourth quart er and fell further through the middle of 
January. 
Because sales of new homes fell 19 percent over the six months ending in November, 
builders have made little progress at paring dow n their bloated inventories.  Despite a 
small decline in the inventory of new homes fo r sale in November, the months’ supply of 
unsold new homes remained more than twice as  high as the upper end of the fairly tight 
range that it had occupied be tween 1997 and the summer of 2005. 
Home prices continued to decelerate in the second half of last year.  The purchase-only 
version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by th e Office of Federal Housing 
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased at an annual rate of 1 percent in the third 
quarter, the first nominal decline since 1993; ove r the four quarters ending in the third 
quarter, this index increased 1.8 percent.  The ten-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-
sales price index—which is more heavily co ncentrated in urban areas that had seen 
greater appreciation in earl ier years—posted a decline of  6¾ percent over the twelve 
months ending in October.  The average pri ce of existing homes sold—which is available 
on a more-timely basis than the other measures  but reflects shifts in the mix of homes 
sold—was 3.7 percent below its year-earlier re ading in November.  In the market for new 
homes, prices were about unchanged from a y ear earlier but have fallen on balance since 
spring, and in November the average price of homes sold declined 2.8 percent.  Recent 
declines in new home prices are consistent  with mounting anecdotal evidence that many 
large homebuilders are resorting to price disc ounts, in addition to nonprice incentives, to 
bolster sales and unload inventory. 
Equipment and Software 
Spending on real equipment and software appear s to have advanced at a sluggish rate in 
the fourth quarter after a so lid increase in the third quart er.  Although outlays in the

volatile transportation equipment category moved up briskly, spending on other types of 
equipment appears to have slowed appreciably. 
Business demand for motor vehicles appeared to firm in the fourth quarter.  Sales to daily 
rental fleets moved up noticeabl y, but the increase was likely tr ansitory.  Sales of medium 
and heavy trucks (classes 4 through 8) edged up in the fourth quarter after falling to a 
four-year low in the third quarter.  The recent strength in truck orders suggests that sales will continue to recover in the next few m onths from the payback that ensued after the 
January 2007 change in diesel engine regula tions.  With respect to aircraft, data on 
shipments and net exports through November su ggest that domestic spending on aircraft 
may have recouped part of its third-quarter de cline.  However, high fuel prices could be 
acting as a drag on spending; Federal Express re cently cited fuel pri ces when it postponed 
taking possession of new aircraft. 
Real outlays on high-tech equipment and softwa re appear to have increased at a subpar 
pace over the second half of last year.  Data from the Quarterly Services Survey show a 
tepid increase in spending on software in th e third quarter, which ma tched a tepid rise in 
real spending on computers and peripheral e quipment.  The subdued growth of computer 
spending likely continued into the fourth quarter:  Shipments of computers and peripheral 
equipment declined, on balance, in Oct ober and November, and IP for computers 
decelerated further in the f ourth quarter.  Orders and shipments of communications 
equipment did not rebound significantly in November from their large declines in 
October, but imports increased briskly in those two months, an indication that real 
spending in this category may post a modest gain in the fourth quarter. 
Business spending on equipment outside of high -tech and transportation appears to have 
fallen in the fourth quarter after posting sizable gains ove r the summer.  Shipments in 
October and November were fairly flat while orders declined, and imports in the first two months of the quarter were below th eir average in the third quarter. 
Available indicators of business conditions and sentiment have deteriorated.  The 
manufacturing diffusion index from the monthly ISM survey declined further in December, and the Philadelphia Fed’s survey of business sentiment plunged in January.  
The ISM semiannual report (released in Decem ber) suggests that this  deterioration of 
business sentiment is being reflected in capital  spending plans.  Compared with the same 
report one year ago, about 10 percent of survey respondents shifted from predicting 
increases in capital expenditures to predicti ng declines.  However, other diffusion indexes 
of capital spending plans paint a less uniformly negative picture;  as noted, the index from

the National Association of Business Economists ' industry survey rebounded in the fourth 
quarter from a third-quarter decline, with capital spendi ng plans improving for both high-
tech equipment and overall equipment. 
In addition, the cost and avai lability of financing for bus iness spending on equipment and 
software has become less favorable, on balan ce.  Although interest rates on investment-
grade corporate bonds have changed little, on net, since the time of the December 
Greenbook, rates on high-yield bonds have rise n considerably.  At banks, the latest 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported widespread tightening of standards and 
terms on loans to business borrowers. 
Nonresidential Construction  
Available data through November  suggest that nonresidential  building activity remained 
vigorous in the fourth quarter.  Although incr eases in investment we re widespread across 
major categories in the second half of 2007, gains were especially large in the office, 
power and communication, and “other” sectors.6  However, several indicators suggest 
that some deceleration of spending may be  in the offing.  The three-month moving 
average of the architectural billings diffusion index—which is reasonably well correlated 
with construction spending six months hence—moved down in the second half of 2007, 
and vacancy rates in the retail sector increased.7  In addition, there are some indications 
that financial turmoil may be affecting ac tivity in this sector .  Although commercial-
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are not an important source of new-construction 
financing, the sharp contraction in CM BS issuance may signal a more general 
deterioration in financing conditions.  Along these lines, nonresidential construction 
contractors have indicated th at funding has become more di fficult to obtain in some 
cases, especially for more speculative projects.8  In addition, signs of decelerating 
commercial property values may redu ce the pace of new construction. 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) repor ted that real expend itures on drilling and 
mining structures jumped at an annual rate of 26 percent in the third quarter after an even 
larger increase in the second quarter.  The magnitude of these reported increases is  
                                                 
6 The “other” sector includes religious, educational, lodging, amusement and recreation, transportation, and 
health-care facilities. 
7 Despite a decline in transactions in the office s ector since September, the available evidence does not 
suggest overbuilding in the office market.  Comple tion of new office space in the third quarter was 
30 percent less than its level of the mid-1980s, a period of substantial overbuilding.  Moreover, the vacancy 
rate in this sector remains well below its cyclical peaks of 1991 and 2003.  
8 These responses were reported in a survey conduct ed by Associated General Contractors of America.

        1.  The baseline assumes that budget authority for discretionary programs grows with inflation after fiscal 2008 and
that no new mandatory spending or tax legislation is enacted.
        2.  Adjustments measure the effect of alternative policies on the deficit and move the baseline closer to policies in
effect in 2007.  Real defense spending on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is assumed to remain at 2007 levels over the nextseveral years and then to drift down.  All expiring tax provisions are assumed to be extended, including relief from theAlternative Minimum Tax, which is assumed to be indexed for inflation after 2007.  Higher net interest costs reflect largerdeficits in the adjusted baseline.

somewhat surprising given other indicators of  activity in this sector, and the latest 
available information suggests a much more modest increase in the fourth quarter.9 
Business Inventories 
Our translation of book-value inventory data through November suggests that the pace of 
stockbuilding in the business sector (excludi ng motor vehicles) was little changed from 
its average rate over the first three quarters of 2007.  The rati o of manufacturing and trade 
book-value inventories (excluding motor vehicl es) to sales ticked down in November.  
Information from the staff’s flow-of-goods system suggests that months’ supply of 
inventories excluding motor vehicles ticked down in November, although this measure 
edged up in December.  The flow-of-goods estimates provide little indication of serious 
inventory imbalances in most of the manufact uring sector.  However,  stock-sales ratios 
do appear to be elevated in i ndustries such as primary metals  and, to a lesser extent, wood 
products, fabricated metal products, and plastic  and rubber products, likely because of the 
ongoing weakness in construction a nd motor vehicle production.   
Federal Government Sector 
The federal unified budg
et situation has deteri orated somewhat in recent months.  Year-
over-year increases in receipts have continued to slow, wher eas the rise in outlays has 
picked up a bit.  The Congre ssional Budget Office (CBO) e xpects the deficit to widen 
noticeably this year; its latest Budget and Economic Outlook , which was released on 
January 23, projects the deficit to widen from 1¼ percent of GDP in fiscal year 2007 to 
1¾ percent of GDP in fiscal 2008 and n early 2½ percent of GDP in 2009, assuming 
current budget policies are extended.10   
Receipts rose 5¾ percen
t in the fourth quarter  of 2007 relative to the same period a year 
earlier.  Individual income a nd payroll taxes posted a 7 perc ent increase, similar to the 
third-quarter rise.  But corpor ate income taxes decreased 6 percent in the fourth quarter 
relative to a year ea rlier, thereby continuing a decline that began during the summer. 
                                                 
9 The BEA’s estimates reflect proprietary information that  is not available to the staff.  In contrast, the 
number of drilling rigs in operation and measures of footage drilled from the Department of Energy (not 
shown) moved up little, on balance, during the second an d third quarters and increased slightly in the fourth 
quarter. 
10 The CBO’s Budget and Economic Outlook projects federal unified budget deficits for both fiscal 2008 
and 2009 assuming the Alternative Minimum Tax and other expiring tax provisions are extended and 
current real levels of spending for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are maintained.  The CBO projection does not include a stimul us package.  The CBO’s budget projections are based on economic 
assumptions that show real GDP growth slowing to 1½ percent over the four quarte rs of this year and the 
unemployment rate rising to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Outlays, adjusted for payment-timing shifts a nd financial transactions , rose 6 percent in 
the fourth quarter relative to a year earlier.  Interest outlays rose nearly 20 percent, as 
high readings on overall CPI inflation booste d the nominal interest costs of Treasury 
inflation-protected securities (TIPS).  Defense outlays rose 8 percent in the fourth quarter 
relative to a year earlier; they  were at a level consistent with a solid gain in NIPA real 
defense purchases last quarter re lative to the third quarter.  
In December, the Congress pa ssed a one-year extension of the Alternative Minimum Tax 
(AMT) and completed action on th e regular appropriations bills.11  An economic stimulus 
package around 1 percentage point of nominal GDP has b een widely discussed, although 
the Administration and congressional lead ership have yet to settle on a plan. 
State and Local Government Sector  
Real state and local government expenditures ap pear to have risen sharply in the fourth 
quarter.  State and local hiri ng was quite vigorous; employment increased an average of 
about 35,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter, well above the so lid monthly pace of 
approximately 20,000 in the first three quarters of 2007.  Real construction expenditures 
increased at a brisk annual rate of about 11 percent, on average, in October and 
November.   
Most states’ budgets remain relatively h ealthy, but fiscal conditions are tightening 
because revenue gains are slowing.  The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State 
and Local Government Tax Revenue  indicates that the year-ove r-year change in state tax 
revenues slowed to 4½ percent in the thir d quarter of 2007, down from the 7¾ percent 
gain over the preceding year.  The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) 
reports that aggregate state revenues have been coming in about as projected in fiscal 
2008 budgets but that receipts in indi vidual states have been mixed.12  Some midwestern 
and western states have experienced larger-than-anticipated gains in revenues, whereas several large coastal states—including California, Florida,  and New York—have 
experienced slower-than-expected increases in re ceipts.  Half of states reported that their 
revenues have been adversely affected by the housing market slump; the categories most  
                                                 
11 The Internal Revenue Service ann ounced that the processing of a sm all number of the early income-tax 
returns may be delayed by a few weeks because of the last-minute reprogramming of its computers as a 
result of the late enactment of the AMT bill.  This delay should have only a minor effect on the timing of 
individual refunds.   
12 Fiscal 2008 began in the third quarter of 2007 for forty-six states.

affected are sales taxes, real estate transaction fees, and capital gains taxes.13  The NCSL 
also reports that recent trends in revenues are generating concern among the states about 
the budget outlook for the remainder of fiscal  2008.  The National Association of State 
Budget Officers reports that states expect year-end budget balances to decline for the 
second consecutive year as a resu lt of the deceleration in revenues.  On average, states 
expect to end fiscal 2008 w ith reserves equal to approxi mately 6¾ percent of general 
fund expenditures, well below the 11½ percent r ecorded at the end of fiscal 2006 but still 
above the 5 percent threshold generally considered to constitute an adequate cushion. 
Prices 
Overall consumer price inflation has stepped up noticeably from the low rates posted last 
summer.  Total PCE prices moved up 0.6 percen t in November and are estimated to have 
increased 0.3 percent in December, thereby bringing the estimated twelve-month change 
in PCE prices through December to 3.5 percen t.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices 
have continued to rise at a faster rate than th ey did during the first ha lf of the year; for the 
year as a whole, core PCE pri ce inflation is estimated to ha ve been the same as in 2006.  
Long-term inflation expectations have moved up toward the top of the range seen in recent years. 
Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in both October and November and are estimated to 
have risen 0.2 percent again in  December.  The estimated increase in core PCE prices 
over the past six months—at an annual rate of 2.6 percent—is up noticeably from the rate 
of 1.9 percent posted over the first half of last year.  The pickup in core PCE price 
inflation over the second half of last year reflects an acceleration in prices that were unusually soft earlier in the year, such as prices for apparel, prescription drugs, and 
nonmarket services.  Smoothing through the vari ation in monthly changes last year, the 
twelve-month change in core PCE prices through December—estimated at 2.3 percent—
is unchanged from a year earlier. 
Consumer energy prices jumped 6 percent in  November after having risen 1½ percent in 
October, and they are estimated to have risen about 1 percent in December.  These 
increases mainly reflect the ongoi ng pass-through of th e higher cost of crude oil into the 
retail prices of gasoline and heating oil, although prices al so moved up, on balance, for 
electricity and natural gas.  At the turn of the year, the pri ce of crude oil surged to about 
$100 per barrel.  However, prices have retrea ted recently as forecasts of demand have  
                                                 
13 To date, property taxes—which are mostly collected by local governments—do not appear to have been 
adversely affected by decreases in house values.  Many states limit the annual increases allowed for 
property tax payments, and thus property tax revenues adjust to changes in house prices only gradually.

been marked down.  Currently, crude oil prices stand at levels close to those seen at the 
time of the December Greenbook.  Survey data through mid-January point to a small 
increase in retail gasoline prices this month.   
After a series of large increases over much of 2007, consumer food inflation has recently 
come in at or below core PCE inflation ra tes.  Although the PCE price index for food and 
beverages is estimated to have risen 4½ percent over the twelve months ending in 
December, consumer food prices rose 0.2 per cent in November and are estimated to have 
been about flat in December.  The upward pressure on retail food prices emanating from 
meats and poultry appears to have eased somewh at late last year as increased supplies 
have begun to come on line.  Elsewhere, a continued run-up in the prices of bakery products and a rebound in egg prices in December were offset by price declines in other categories of food at home.  In commodity ma rkets, grain prices have moved up sharply 
since the December Greenbook, as strong glob al demand has outpaced current world 
supplies, whereas prices for livestock have declined. 
The high readings on overall consumer price in flation late last year appear to have 
contributed to a pickup in infl ation expectations.  As measur ed by the Reuters/University 
of Michigan Survey, median expectations for year-ahead inflation moved up to 
3.4 percent in November and remained at that  level in December a nd early January.  The 
survey’s measure of median inflation exp ectations over the next five to ten years 
increased to 3.1 percent in December but ticked down to 3.0 percent in the preliminary January release.  Since the December Gree nbook, inflation compensation derived from 
TIPs has been mixed: five-year inflation co mpensation has declined about 0.2 percentage 
point, and the five-year-ahead measure ha s risen nearly 0.2 pe rcentage point. 
Outside the energy sector, price pressures at  earlier stages of processing have also 
increased somewhat of late.  The producer  price index (PPI) for core intermediate 
materials rose 1 percent in November and rema ined flat in December.  The prices of a 
number of energy-intensive in termediate materials—such as  industrial an d agricultural 
chemicals and plastics—moved up briskly late last year, but the prices of construction 
materials moved sideways, and the prices of metal products declined.  On balance last 
year, the index for core intermediate materi als increased 3¼ percent, compared with the 
4½ percent rise over 2006.  
Commodity prices have risen significantly  over the past year, and this trend has 
continued since the December Greenbook.  The Journal of Commerce (JOC) index of 
industrial materials has increas ed 1.5 percent since early December, and the Commodity

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  Overview 
While pressures in short-term funding market s have eased somewhat since the December 
FOMC meeting, perceptions of  a deteriorating economic ou tlook have weighed heavily 
on broader financial markets.  Equity pr ice indexes have plunged, and corporate bond 
spreads have shot up to their highest leve ls since 2003.  The FOMC lowered the target 
federal funds rate 75 basis points on January 22, and market participants place high odds 
on at least 50 basis points of additional eas ing at the upcoming FOMC meeting.  Further 
ahead, the expected policy path bottoms out  at about 2 percent in early 2009, about 
120 basis points lower than at the time of the December meeting.  Nominal Treasury 
yields have dropped sharply.  Near-term in flation compensation has moved somewhat 
lower, on net, but inflation compensation at mo re-distant horizons has risen modestly.   
 
 
 Delinquency rates on subprime mortgages in creased markedly, and those on prime 
mortgages and on nonmortgage consumer loans edged up.  Issuance of securities backed 
by nonconforming residential mortgages fell to its slowest pace since 2002.  Commercial 
bank credit continued to expa nd briskly, spurred by strong gr owth in business loans and 
in nonmortgage consumer loans.  In the January 2008 Senior Lo an Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices, banks reported further net tightening of terms and standards on business and household loans over the past three months. 
Money Market Functioning 
Conditions in short-term funding markets have improved since the December FOMC 
meeting, but strains remain.  Spreads of term  federal funds rates and libor over rates on 
comparable-maturity overnight index swaps have narrowed substant ially, on net, since 
the December FOMC but are still elevated by historical standards.  Spreads on asset-
backed commercial paper, as well as those on lower-rated nonfinancial unsecured paper, 
also fell significantly on net.   Asset-backed commercial pa per outstanding increased in 
each of the first two weeks of  January, after having contracted in every week since 
August. 
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose after th e turn of the year, as market participants 
reported significantly improved trading conditions; more recently, however, renewed 
safe-haven flows along with the lower policy pa th pushed yields markedly lower, on net, 
and liquidity in the bill market deteriorated.  In addition, rate s on general collateral 
Treasury repurchase agreements have generally traded substantially  below the overnight 
federal funds rate since the December FOMC.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The expected path of monetary policy over th e next year has tilted down steeply since the 
December FOMC meeting, largely in respons e to concerns about a deteriorating 
economic outlook.  Economic data, particul arly the ISM and employment reports 
released just after the turn of the year, came in weaker than expected, prompting strong 
reactions from market participants.  Reports of heavy losses at larg e financial institutions 
on mortgage-related securities also appeared to have pushe d down policy expectations, 
even as some large financial instituti ons were successful in raising capital. 
 
 
 Investors largely anticipated the Committee’s decision to lower the target federal funds 
rate 25 ba
sis points at the December meeting, though they were reportedly disappointed 
by the absence of any accompanyi ng measures to address strains in term funding markets.  
Some of that surprise was reversed th e next day, following the announcement of the 
Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the associat ed swap lines with th e European and Swiss 
central banks.  The release of the minutes of the December FOMC meeting elicited little 
market reaction.  The expected policy path moved down a few basis points with the 
Chairman’s speech on January 10, as market participants reportedly interpreted the remarks as suggesting that the FOMC would likely ease policy aggressively in response 
to a deterioration in the economic outlook. 
The 75 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate on January 22 largely 
surprised market participants, and implied rate s on short-dated futures contracts declined 
sharply on the announcement.   On net, market  participants now expect the federal funds 
rate to decline to about 2 percent by early 2009, about 120 basis points lower than they had priced in at the time of  the December meeting.  Options on federal funds futures 
contracts indicate that invest ors place high odds on at least 50 basis points of policy 
easing at next week’s FOMC meeting.  On balance, uncertainty about the course of 
monetary policy over the next six months has changed little on net since early December; option-implied distributions of the federa l funds rate over that horizon remained 
negatively skewed around a signi ficantly lower modal outcome. 
Consistent with the revision in  policy expectations and the re duction in the target federal 
funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities have decl ined substantially 
since the December FOMC, and the yield curve has steepened somewhat further; the two-
year yield has dropped 110 basis points, while  the ten-year yield has declined about 
60 basis points.  Near-term inflation compensation increased in early January amid rising oil prices, but it subsequently retreated and is now about 15 basis points lower, on net,

 Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes have fallen 14 percent over the intermeeting period, on 
perceptions of a deteriorati ng economi
c outlook and addition al write-downs by financial 
institutions.  Declines were widespread across sectors, bu t bank stocks were again among 
the hardest hit.  Stock prices of financial guarantors continued their precipitous declines 
with the news of possible and actual downgr ades of their insure r ratings, which also 
fueled already elevated concerns in the broader markets about further losses on CDOs 
and municipal securities.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained high 
by historical standards and increased markedly in the past few days.  The spread between 
the twelve-month-forward trend earnings-to- price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real 
long-run Treasury yield—a rough gauge of th e equity risk premium—widened further 
and is now at the upper end of its ra nge over the past two decades.   
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds ha ve fallen less than those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities since th e December FOMC meeting, while yields on 
speculative-grade bonds have risen about 80 basis points.  As a result, corporate bond spreads climbed to their highest levels si nce early 2003.  The run-up in speculative-grade 
spreads was particularly sharp and primarily reflected higher near-t erm forward spreads, 
suggesting increased concern among investor s about the outlook fo r corporate credit 
quality over the next few years.  Far-te rm forward spreads on speculative-grade bonds 
rose a bit above recent peaks, suggesting that corporate bond investors now require somewhat greater compensation for credit risk. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
W
ith about 100 earnings reports in hand and analysts’ forecasts for the rema
inder, 
operating earnings per share for the S&P 500 firm s in the fourth quart er are projected to 
have been about 20 percent below year-ago le vels, depressed by huge losses at financial 
firms.  In contrast, for nonfinancial firms in  the S&P 500, four-quarter growth in earnings 
per share is projected to have been about 12 percent.  Revisions to year-ahead earnings 
for the S&P 500 as a whole were substantia lly negative in the month ending in mid-
December, but revisions were modestly positive for nonfinancial firms.

Overall, the credit quality of  nonfinancial firms continued to  be solid.  Data on corporate 
balance sheets for the third quarter of 2007 i ndicate that the aggr egate ratio of liquid 
assets to total assets stayed high by historic al standards, while a ggregate leverage ticked 
up but remained low.  In December, rating downgrades on corporate bonds were again 
modest.  In addition, the r ealized six-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds 
stayed near zero in December, and the de linquency rate on C&I loans was close to 
historical lows in the third quarter.  The for ecast of the aggregate year-ahead default rate 
based on the KMV model moved up further in December, but remained moderately low 
by historical standards. 
 
 
 Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial fi
rms was strong in December but appears to have 
stepped down in January.  The moderation in  bond issuance likely  reflects typical 
seasonal patterns and rising yields on specu lative-grade bonds.  Ou tstanding nonfinancial 
commercial paper declined somewhat in D ecember but rebounded in January.  C&I loans 
expanded briskly in December and in the firs t half of January, though at a considerably 
slower pace than over the second half of 2007.  Aggrega ting across bonds, commercial 
paper, and C&I loans, net debt financing in  the fourth quarter a bout matched its robust 
third-quarter pace.   
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial fi rms, including both s easoned and initial 
public offerings, slowed in December and has been very light in January, likely due to 
typical seasonal patterns and the drop in equity  prices.  In the third quarter, the combined 
level of public and private e quity issuance was dwarfed agai n by the extraordinary pace 
of equity retirements.  This pattern likely  continued in the fourth quarter, judging from 
the partial data in hand on equity retirement s.  Retirements from cash-financed mergers 
and acquisitions set a new record in the fourth quarter, boosted by a few blockbuster 
leveraged buyouts from the pipeline of pending d eals.  However, relatively few new deals 
were announced.  Meanwhile, announcemen ts of new share repurchase programs by 
nonfinancial firms have continued apace. 
Commercial Real Estate 
The growth of commercial mortgage debt slowed a bit in the third quarter (latest 
complete data), perhaps restrained by an upward drift in commercial mortgage rates.  
Even so, the pace of debt growth in this sect or stayed in the upper end of its range over 
the past decade.  The sharp decline in co mmercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
issuance in the fourth quarter (not shown) suggests that the growth of commercial

mortgage debt may have slowed further.  Sales of commercial real estate decreased again 
in December, but remained high by historical standards.   
 
 
 
 Since the December FOMC meeting
, spreads of yields on AAA-rated CMBS over those 
on comparable-maturity Treasuries have rema ined at historically high levels, while 
spreads on BBB-rated CMBS continued to so ar.  These elevated spreads reportedly 
reflect continued concerns about high levels of leverage on recently securitized 
mortgages and about credit risks in structured fi nancial products in general.  Interest rates 
on commercial mortgages originated for secu ritization increased but remained below 
their highs early on in this decade. 
Fundamentals in the commercial re al estate sector continued to  be solid on the whole.  In 
the fourth quarter, the vacancy rate on commercial properties remained near its average 
level, and commercial rents continued to grow moderatel y.  Delinquency rates on CMBS 
stayed low through November; and in the third quarter, the delinquency rate on 
commercial real estate loans held at life insu rance companies remained near zero.  At the 
same time, commercial banks experienced a further uptick in commercial mortgage 
delinquencies, although the rate remained low by historical standards. 
Household Finance 
The growth of residential m
ortgage debt declined further in the third quarter.  
Nonm
ortgage consumer credit continued to gr ow at a moderate pace in November.  Since 
the December FOMC, interest rates on thirty-y ear fixed-rate conforming mortgages have 
fallen roughly in line with those on comp arable-maturity Treasuries, and indicative 
quotes on thirty-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage rates have fall en as well.  Interest rates 
on credit card and auto loans have been about unchanged (not shown), although their 
spreads over Treasury rates have widened.  
Household loan performance has deterior ated further on balance, though problem s 
rema
ined concentrated among subprime mortga ge borrowers.  In November, delinquency 
rates on variable-rate and fixed-rate subpr ime mortgages continued to rise notably, 
reaching 21 percent and 7.5 percent, respec tively.  Meanwhile, delinquency rates on 
variable-rate prime mortgages edged up to 2 percent, while those on fixed-rate prime 
mortgages stayed near 1 percent.  The deli nquency rate on auto loans held at captive 
finance companies ticked up further in Novemb er and now stands at its highest level 
since 1998.  In general, delinquency rates on nonmortgage consumer credit have trended 
up over the past year but remained at or belo w their average levels over the past decade.

While issuance of nonconforming residential- mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) was 
extremely weak in the fourth quarter, i ssuance of MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac (not shown) was robust.  Issuance of consumer  auto and credit card asset-
backed securities also remained solid last  quarter, although the deals were placed at 
notably higher spreads than in early autumn. 
 
  
 OFHEO’s purchase-only index of national hom e prices posted a small nom
inal decrease 
in the third quarter.  S&P/Case-Shiller’s te n-city composite house pr ice index fell sharply 
in October, leading financial market partic ipants to mark down the expected path for 
house prices slightly.  S&P/Case-Shiller futures quotes now i ndicate that investors expect 
house prices to fall at least through the middle of 2008 in each of the ten large cities that 
they cover.  With stock prices having declined  last quarter and house prices likely to have 
done so as well, the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income is 
estimated to have fallen in the fourth qua rter.  Long-term mutu al funds received net 
inflows in December despite continued net redemptions of domestic equity funds.  On 
balance, money market funds attracted new cas h in December, but much less than in the 
previous few months. 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Treasury auctions of two-, five -, and ten-year nominal notes and of ten- and twenty-year 
TIPS notes over the intermeeting period were a ll well received.  The Treasury raised the 
size of its bill auctions to offset the bills redeemed by the Federal Reserve to 
accommodate credit extended through the TAF.  Foreign custody holdings at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York were generally about flat, and forei gn participation in 
Treasury auctions continued to decline mode stly.  Spreads between on-the-run and off-
the-run ten-year yields widene d further to their highest levels since 2003.  However, bid-
asked spreads on both on-the-run and off-the-ru n Treasury notes have retreated somewhat 
since the end of the year and trading volume of on-the-run Tr easury securities has picked 
up. 
Yield spreads on GSE debt have declined  on net since the December FOMC, but 
remained a bit elevated by historical standards.  In January, Moody’s placed Freddie Mac 
on watch for a possible downgrade of its fi nancial strength rating.  Moody’s decision 
followed Freddie Mac’s announcement on the day of the December FOMC meeting that it expected substantial portfolio losses in th e fourth quarter.  GSE equity prices have 
fallen notably since the Decembe r FOMC meeting.  In early January, Fannie Mae raised 
capital by issuing $7 billi on of preferred stock, roughl y matching Freddie Mac’s

1 Historically, financial guarantors insure about half of municipal bonds.  State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds was solid in D ecember but has slowed in 
January.  While broadly consistent w
ith typi cal seasonal patterns, this recent slowdown 
may also reflect heightened concerns over the credit quality of financial guarantors.1  
Issuance of short-term municipal bonds was moderate in both months, suggesting state 
and local governments are not experiencing substantial near-ter m funding pressures. 
The credit quality of municipal bonds has dete riorated somewhat in recent months.  After 
having spiked in the fourth quarter, the number of municipal bond downgrades by 
Standard & Poor’s was neglig ible in early January.  Yiel ds on municipal bonds have 
fallen roughly in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasuries since the December FOMC meeting.  As a result,  the ratio of m unicipal bond yields to Treasuries has 
remained near its recent peak.  Fitch downgrad ed a major financial guarantor in January 
from AAA to AA, intensifying concerns that  credit ratings on a substantial portion of 
municipal bonds outstanding might also be downgraded.  Nonetheless, state and local 
government balance sheets have generally remained solid. 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded m
oderately in December.  Re
tail money funds advanced briskly, likely 
reflecting safe-haven flows, and growth in  small time deposits was supported by some 
large thrifts that continued to offer unusually high rates on these depos its.  In contrast, 
growth of liquid deposits remained slack, a nd currency contracted notably in December, 
reflecting the ongoing trend in overseas demand away from U.S. dollar banknotes toward 
those in euro and other currencies.    
Commercial bank credit expanded strongly in  December, supported by robust growth in 
business loans and in nonmortgage loans to households.  C&I loans surged in December, 
with strength evident across different size categories of domestic banks and foreign 
institutions.  Lending to busine sses through commercial real es tate loans stay ed solid in 
December.  In contrast, residential real es tate loans were only up a little in December, 
even as revolving home equity loans expande d briskly.  Consumer loans grew rapidly, 
possibly because of lower short-term interest  rates.   The strength in bank lending in 
December occurred despite the reported tight ening of credit conditions: According to the 
January 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey, domestic and foreign banks indicated

1 Banks received the survey in early January, and their responses were due on January 17. Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
 
 
 
 
 
 The January 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.1 Special questions in the survey queried banks about changes in terms on 
commercial real estate loans during 2007, expect ed changes in asset quality in 2008, and loss-
mitigation strategies on residential mortgage loans.  In addition, the survey included a new set of 
recurring questions regarding revolving home equity li nes of credit.  This appendix is based on 
responses from fifty-four domestic banks and twenty-three foreign banking institutions. 
In the January survey, domestic and foreign ins titutions reported having tightened their lending 
standards and terms for a broad range of loan types over the past three months.  Demand for bank loans reportedly had weakened, on net, for both businesses and households over the same period.     
Business Lending 
Questions on commercial and industrial (C&I) lending.  In the January survey, one-third of 
domestic institutions—a larger net fraction th an in the October survey—reported having 
tightened their lending standards on C&I loans bot h to small and to large and middle-market 
firms over the past three months.  Significant net fractions of respondents also noted that they had 
tightened pricing terms on C&I loans to all types of firms, including raising the cost of credit 
lines and the premiums charged on riskier loans over the survey period.  About 40 percent of domestic banks—a higher net fraction than in th e October survey—reported increasing spreads of 
loan rates over their cost of funds over the pr evious three months.  Smaller net fractions of 
domestic banks also indicated that they had tight ened nonpricing terms on C&I loans to all types 
of firms. 
Compared with domestic institutions, larger net fractions of U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks reported having tightened lending st andards and terms on C&I loans.  About two-
thirds of foreign banks—up from one-third in the October survey—noted that they had tightened their lending standards on C&I loans over the p ast three months, and large majorities also 
reported that they had tightened selected pricing terms for such loans.  Indeed, about 85 percent of foreign banks—a higher net fraction than in the October survey—indicated that they had  
increased spreads of loan rates over their cost  of funds over the past three months.   
Large majorities of domestic and foreign institutio ns that reported tightening lending standards 
and terms on C&I loans over the past three months pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry-specific problems, and a reduced tolerance for risk as

reasons for their more-restrictive lending policies.   Smaller but significant fractions of domestic 
and foreign banks noted that a deterioration of their current or expected capital or liquidity 
positions had contributed to the tightening of lending standards and terms over the past three 
months. 
 
 
 
 
 On net, large domestic banks reported that de mand for C&I loans from large and middle-market 
firms was about unchanged over the past three months, whereas about 40 percent of small 
domestic banks, on net, reportedly experienced w eaker demand for C&I loans from these firms.  
About one-fifth of both large and small domestic  banks, on net, also saw weaker demand for C&I 
loans from small firms.  Finally about 40 percent of foreign institutions reported weaker demand, 
on net, for C&I loans over the past three months. 
Nearly all domestic institutions that indicated a weakening of loan demand pointed to a decrease 
in customers’ needs to finance inventories and i nvestment in plant and equipment.  In addition, 
about three-fourths of domestic banks and all fo reign respondents cited a decrease in customers’ 
needs for merger and acquisiti on financing as a reason for lower demand for C&I loans.  
Regarding future business, about 15 percent of domestic and 50 percent of foreign respondents, 
on net, reported that the number of inquiri es from potential business borrowers had decreased 
over the previous three months. Questions on commercial real estate lending.   About 80 percent of domestic banks reported 
tightening their lending standards on commercial re al estate loans over the past three months, a 
notable increase from the October survey.  The net fraction of domestic banks reporting tighter 
lending standards on these loans was the highest since this question was introduced in 1990.   
About 55 percent of foreign banks—up from about 40 percent in the October survey—indicated 
that they had tightened their lending standards on such loans.  Concerning loan demand, about 40 percent of domestic respondents and 50 per cent of foreign respondents reported weaker 
demand for commercial real estate loans over the past three months.   
As in past years, the January survey querie d banks about changes in their lending terms on 
commercial real estate loans over the previous twelve months.  The responses to these special 
questions indicated that considerable net fracti ons of banks had tightened terms on commercial 
real estate loans in 2007; by contrast, in last year’s survey banks reported that they had eased 
lending terms, on net, in 2006.  In the latest survey, about half of domestic and foreign 
respondents noted that they had required higher de bt service coverage ratios and lower loan-to-
value ratios on commercial real estate loans in 2007.   In addition, about 40 percent of domestic 
banks and 50 percent of foreign banks indicated that they had reduced the maximum loan sizes 
that they were willing to grant over the past tw elve months.  About 45 percent of domestic banks 
and 75 percent of foreign banks repor ted raising loan rate spreads over their cost of funds in 2007.

A large number of domestic and foreign respondent s pointed to a less favorable economic outlook 
and to a worsening of the conditions of, or the out look for, commercial real  estate in the markets 
where their banks operate as reasons for tightening terms on commercial real estate loans in 2007.  
In addition, a large fraction of domestic banks not ed a reduced tolerance for risk, whereas foreign 
banks indicated that reduced liquidity of the secu rities collateralized by these types of loans was 
an important factor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
2 Fifty-one institutions reported that they originated prime residential mortgages.  According to Call 
Reports, these fifty-one banks accounted  for about 80 percent of residentia l real estate loans on the books 
of all commercial banks as  of September 30, 2007. 
3 According to Call Reports, these thirty-nine institutio ns accounted for about 70 percent of residential 
real estate loans on the books of all co mmercial banks as of September 30, 2007. 
4 According to Call Reports, these eight institutions accounted for about 45 percent of residential real

Questions on residential real estate lending.  In the January survey, significant numbers of 
domestic respondents reported that they had ti ghtened their lending standards on prime, 
nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgag es over the past three months; the remaining 
respondents noted that their lending standards had remained basically unchanged.  About 
55 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages, up from about 40 percent in the October survey.
2  Of the thirty-nine banks that 
originated nontraditional residential mortgage lo ans, about 85 percent reported a tightening of 
their lending standards on such loans over the past  three months, compared with 60 percent in the 
October survey.3  Finally, five of the eight banks that originated subprime mortgage loans noted 
that they had tightened their lending standards on su ch loans, a proportion similar to that in the 
October survey.4 
About 60 percent of domestic respondents, on net,  indicated that demand for prime and subprime 
residential mortgages had weakened over the past three months, and 70 percent of respondents, on net, noted weaker demand for nontraditional mort gage loans over the same period.  The net 
fractions reporting weaker demand for each of the three types of mortgage loans increased 
relative to the October survey. 
About 60 percent of domestic respondents indi cated that they had tightened their lending 
standards for approving applications for revolving home equity lines of credit over the past three 
months.  Regarding demand, about 40 percent of  domestic banks, on net, reported that demand 
for revolving home equity lines of credit had weakened over the past three months.

Questions on consumer lending.  About 10 percent of respondents—up from about 5 percent in 
the October survey—reported that they had tight ened their lending standards on credit card loans 
over the past three months.  About one-quarter of respondents noted that they had reduced the 
extent to which such loans were  granted to customers who did not meet credit-scoring thresholds; 
smaller net fractions also indicated an increase in minimum required credit scores and a reduction of credit limits on credit card loans.  About 15 percent of domestic banks—up from about 
5 percent in the October survey—indicated a diminished willingness to make consumer installment loans relative to three months earlier.  One-third of domestic banks—up from one-fourth in the October survey—reported that they had tightened their lending standards on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  Signi ficant net fractions of banks also noted that 
they had tightened lending terms and conditions on such loans.  In particular, domestic banks 
increased minimum credit scores, reduced the exte nt to which such loans were granted to 
customers who did not meet credit-scoring thres holds, and widened spreads of loan rates over 
their cost of funds.  Regarding loan demand, one-t hird of domestic institutions, on net, indicated 
that they had experienced weaker dema nd for consumer loans of all types. 
 
 
 
 Special Questions on the Outlook for Loan Quality in 2008 
A set of special questions asked banks about thei r expectations for delinquencies and charge-offs 
on loans to businesses and households in 2008 under the assumption that economic activity 
progresses in line with consensus forecasts.  On balance, th e responses indicate that large 
majorities of domestic and foreign banks expect  a deterioration in loan quality in 2008.  
Regarding loans to businesses, between about 75 percent and 85 percent of domestic and foreign 
banks expect a deterioration in the quality of their C&I and commercial real estate loan portfolios.  
In particular, about 15 percent of domestic and 20 percent of foreign respondents expect a 
substantial deterioration in the quality of thei r commercial real estate portfolio.  Concerning 
residential real estate loans, between about 75  percent and 80 percent of domestic respondents 
expect the quality of their prime, nontraditional,  and subprime residential mortgage loans, as well 
as of their revolving home equity loans, to deteriorate in 2008.  Finally, about 70 percent of domestic respondents expect a deterioration of th e quality of both credit card and other consumer 
loans. 
Special Questions on Loss-Mitigation Strategies on Residential Mortgage Loans 
A final set of special questions queried domestic  respondents about strategies that they expect 
their banks to employ in order to mitigate a poten tial deterioration in the credit quality of their 
banks’ residential mortgage loan portfolio or of  the mortgage loans that  their banks service for 
others.  More than 85 percent of respondent s indicated that they expect loan-by-loan 
modifications based on individual borrowers’ circumstances to be at least a somewhat significant 
loss-mitigation strategy at their banks.  More than 65 percent of respondents also anticipate 
steps—such as short sales or deed-in-lieu of fo reclosures—in which borrowers lose possession of 
III-A-9 
the house to be at least somewhat significant lo ss-mitigation strategies at their banks.  A large 
number of respondents also indicated that their loss-mitigation strategies will include refinancing 
of loans into other mortgage products at their banks or into Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) products.  Finally, about one-third of respondents expect streamlined loan modifications of the sort proposed by the Hope Now Alliance to be  a significant loss-mitigating strategy for their 
banks. 
 
 Domestic respondents expect their banks to f ace several potential obstacles in undertaking these 
loss-mitigation strategies:  Respondents anticipat e difficulties in contacting borrowers, and they 
are concerned with borrowers’ reduced motivation to  retain possession of their properties.  To a 
lesser extent, respondents also anticipate difficu lties arising from a shortage of qualified loss-
mitigation specialists at their banks.

The average value of exports in October and November was 8.1 percent (a.r.) higher than 
in the third quarter.  Higher exports of services were an important contributor to the 
increase in both months.  Exports of indus trial supplies also r ecorded a strong gain, 
boosted by a large increase in  exports of fuels in Nove mber.  Higher exports of 
sem
iconductors, aircraft, and machinery pus hed up exports of capital goods, while 
exports of agricultural goods increased only slightly following a large jump in the third 
quarter.  In contrast, exports of consumer  goods and automotive products fell from their 
level in the third quarter. 
The average value of imports in October and November increased 11.6 percent (a.r.) from 
the third qua
rter.  The increase in imports almost  entirely reflected a jump in the value of 
imported oil, as imports of non-oil goods ro se only 1.3 percent.  Non-oil goods imports 
were boosted by a large increase in imports of consumer goods, which more than offset a 
steep decline in imports of non-oil industrial supplies.  Imports of automotive products

and capital goods recorded modest increases, with the increase in  capital goods primarily 
reflecting a jump in imports of  telecommunications equipment.  Imports of services grew 
strongly. 
 
 
 Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   The average level of core import  prices in the fourth quarter was 
4 percent (a.r.) above the thir d-quarter average, as prices  increased in all m
ajor sub-
categories.  Prices for materi al-intensive goods were up near ly 8 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  After rising sharply in October and November, prices for imported nonfuel 
industrial supplies rose at a slower pace in December as metal prices fell.  In the fourth 
quarter, prices for finished goods increased 2¼ percent.  Within finished goods, prices for 
capital goods excluding computers and semi conductors and automotive products both 
increased at a rate of 3 percent, whereas pri ces for consumer goods rose only 1¾ percent.  
Outside of core goods, prices for imported computers fell 2½ percent (a.r.), whereas 
semiconductors prices rose 1 pe rcent in the fourth quarter.  
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil fell 0.6 percent in December, after a 13 percent 
increase in November.  In contrast, the s pot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) 
crude oil surged in December and broke the $10 0 per barrel mark in early January.  Since 
then, the spot price of WTI has fallen back amid growing concerns a bout the strength of 
economic activity.  As of the close of trad ing on January 22, the spot price of WTI stood 
at $89.86 per barrel.  In contrast  to the volatility in near-ter m prices, the futures price for 
delivery at the end of 2016 has been much stead ier and stands near $88 per barrel, little 
changed from the time of the December Greenbook. 
Exports.   The average level of core export pric es in the fourth quarter was 9¼ percent 
(a.r.) above the third-quarter  average, as prices of ma terial-intensive goods soared 
18 percent and prices of fini shed goods were up 2½ percent.  The large increase in 
material-intensive goods reflected a 40 percen t increase in prices fo r agricultural exports 
combined with a 12 percent in crease in prices for nonagricu ltural industrial supplies.  
Prices for agricultural exports ro se briskly in all three months of the quarter.  In contrast, 
prices for nonagricultural industrial supplie s rose at a much slower pace in December 
than in November.  Within finished goods, the category with the la rgest fourth-quarter 
increase was capital goods excluding comput ers and semiconductors, which rose almost 
3 percent.  Outside of core goods, prices for exported computer s declined 4¼ percent 
(a.r.) in the fourth quarter, whereas prices for exported se miconductors rose 1½ percent.

U.S. Current Account 
In Decem
ber, the U.S. current account defici t was reported at $714 billion (a.r.) for the 
third quarter of 2007, $42 billion narrower than in the second quarter (revised).  Most of 
this narrowing was the result of an increase in net investment income which remains 
large and positive in spite of the substantial negative net international investment position 
of the United States; direct investment and “other” private income receipts (portfolio 
interest and dividend payments ) both moved higher.  In addition, the deficit on goods and 
services narrowed by $21 bill ion as widespread increases  in goods exports outpaced 
increases in imports.  There was only a slight increase in the net surplus on services. 
Partially offsetting these improvements was an  increase in net unilateral transfers to 
foreigners, primarily increases in U.S. Government grants and private remittances and other transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
The financial flows associated with the curr ent account are presente d in the Summary of 
U.S. International Transactions table.  The impact of the recent financial market turmoil 
on U.S. financial flows is apparent in the re cently-released balance of payments data for 
the third quarter of 2007.  Recorded net pr ivate financial inflows moved down to $56 
billion.  There was also an a pparent ‘flight-to-quality’ in private foreign demand for U.S. 
securities, as net purchases of U.S. Treasuries picked up, while on net private foreigners sold corporate and agency debt and stocks.  Measured official inflows plummeted to $37 
billion, the smallest recorded quart erly inflow since early 2005.   
 
 
 
 In sum, third-quarter recorded net financial inflows were significantly smaller than the 
recorded current account.  The resulting statistical discrepanc y totalled $86 billion for the 
quarter and $138 billion for the first three quarters of 2007.  This positive statistical 
discrepancy indicates some combination of under-recorded net financial inflows or over-
recorded net imports of goods and services and other transactions measured in the current 
account balance. 
U.S. direct investment abroad in the third quarter (line 6) weakened as the pace of new 
investment by U.S. corporations in their fo reign affiliates fell sharply.  In contrast, 
foreign direct investment flows into the United States (line 7) surged  to a record level on 
increased investment of new capital and c ontinued strength in reinvested earnings. 
One notable impact of the recent financial turmoil was the sharp contraction in global 
demand for, and hence issuance of, asset-backed commercial pa per.  As a result, U.S. 
nonbank entities that had issued commercial pa per in the United States to fund their 
foreign parents’ operations were forced to sharply reduce lending to foreign affiliates.  
This reduction in U.S. claims on foreigners  implied sizable net nonbank financial inflows 
in the third quarter (inc luded in line 10).   
Turning to recent monthly data, in November  net flows into U.S. securities by foreign 
private investors (line 4) were at the pace seen prior to the turmoil (top-left panel of the 
chart on Private Security Flows).  There wa s continued strength in foreign demand for 
relatively safe assets.  Net foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries (lin e 4a) fell slightly but 
remained strong, totaling $25 billion, and purchas es of agency debt (line 4b) picked up 
slightly to $5 billion.  In contrast, forei gn demand for corporate and municipal debt (line 
4c) remained extremely weak at $8 billion. This weak demand coincided with unusually 
low issuance of U.S. corporate bonds in recent  months, as the rate of new debt issuance 
IV-9 
fell to 2002 levels.  Net foreign purchases of U.S. stock (line 4d) fell to $7 billion from 
October’s elevated pace. 
 Net inflows from foreign official investors rose to $67 billion in Nove
 mber (line 1), a 
record monthly pace (top-left panel of the chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows).  
 
.  Partial and confidential da ta on custody accounts at FRBNY point to 
continued strong inflows in December and January.  Note that recent high profile investments by sovereign wealth funds into U. S. financial firms are not yet apparent in 
these data and will be captured with other December securities transactions and reported in the upcoming months.  Following on weak readings in October, ther e was a further sharp decline in U.S. demand 
for foreign securities (line 5) in November, with the balance shifting to net sales of $19 
billion.  Demand was particularly weak for European and Japanese stocks and Asian 
debt.  Net sales have been fairly rare in re cent years (bottom-left panel of the chart on 
Private Security Flows) and in part reflect  lower issuance of dolla r-denominated foreign 
debt.   Flows through the banking sector (line 3) remained volatile, turning from a modest 
inflow in October to a modest outflow in November.

Foreign Financial Markets  
Conditions in European interbank money markets improved substantially over the period, 
although concerns about slower U.S. growth  and potential spi llovers to foreign 
economies weighed on equity markets.  Spreads between 3-month interbank offer rates and overnight index swaps (OIS), an indicator of credit concerns in the term-money market, declined 47 and 77 basis points in eu ro and sterling, respect ively, down to their 
November levels.  The announcement of coordinated central bank measures on December 12, including the Federal Reserve’s Term Auction Facility and swap lines with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Sw iss National Bank (SNB), appeared to 
contribute to these declines.  The ECB and the SNB auctioned off the dollars obtained in 
swap arrangements with the Federal Reserve.   The ECB auctioned a total of $20 billion at 
the marginal rates and maturities of the first two TAF auctions on December 17 and December 20, and re-auctioned $10 billion on January 15 at the marginal rate and 
maturity of the third TAF auctions.  The SNB auctioned $4 billion of 28-day funds on 
December 17 at a weighted average rate of 4.79 percent, and again on January 14 at a rate 
of 3.91 percent.  The bid-to-cover ratios  were 2.2, 1.4, and 1.48 for the ECB auctions, 
lower than the 4.2 and 2.73 recorded for the SN B’s auctions.  The volume of bids in the 
ECB’s auction was likely dampened by the 17 pe rcent haircut on collateral.  In the FX 
swap market, bid-ask spread s have fallen and trading volumes have increased.  The 
amount of outstanding European asset-back ed commercial paper (ABCP) declined in 
December, but rose sharply in early January.   Despite these improvements, global equity  prices have fallen sharply since mid- 
December, amid increasing concerns about furt her financial distress and spillovers from 
slower U.S growth.  Major indexes in Europe an d Japan dropped on balance 15 to          
20 percent.  Banking sector share prices ofte n led the declines amid concerns about the 
balance-sheet impact of the sub-prime crisis . Lower-than-expected earning reports by JP 
Morgan and Citigroup, among others, contributed to  the sharp declines in recent days.    
Several sovereign wealth funds announced that they would inject capital into U.S. and 
foreign banks over the period: Abu Dhab i Investment Authority: $7.5 billion to 
Citigroup, Singapore Government Investment Corporation: $9.7 billion to UBS, China Investment Corporation: $5 billion to Morg an Stanley, Temasek Holdings (Singapore): 
$4.4 billion to Merrill Lynch.  Implied volatil ities on the major equity indexes, after 
decreasing toward year end, rose in January.  Ten-year European, Canadian, and Japanese 
nominal sovereign bond yields fell  23 to 38 basis points on net, as prospects for monetary 
easing increased and investors scaled back riskier positions.

The broad trade-weighted index of the do llar is little cha nged on balance since 
mid-December, as the dollar appreciated 4.6 and 1.8 percent agai nst sterling and the 
Canadian dollar, respectively, but depreciated 5.9 percent vi s-à-vis the yen.  Concerns 
about slower economic growth in Canada and the United Kingdom contributed to the 
weakness of the Canadian dollar and ster ling, whereas the strengthening of the yen 
appeared to be driven in part by the unwi nding of carry-trade positions. On January 22, 
the Bank of Canada cut the target for its  policy rate 25 basis points, citing lower 
Canadian inflation and a weaker outlook for the U.S. economy. 
 
 The dollar appreciated 1.5 and 3.7 percent against the Mexica n peso and Brazilian real, 
respectively.  Most Latin American equity  indexes dropped 6 to 17 percent.  EMBI+ 
spreads increased 50 and 67 basis points for Mexico and Brazil.  Asian equity indexes 
also declined substantially.  The dollar depreciated about 1.9 percen t against the Chinese 
renminbi, but appreciated 2.5 percent vis-à- vis the Thai baht.  The Bank of Thailand 
announced on December 17 that it would furt her relax capital controls imposed in 
December 2006 to allow greater foreign currency holdings and to encourage capital outflows.  The People's Bank of China raised the required reserve ratio for banks and its 
benchmark interest rate, together with the one-year lending and deposit rates, in a series 
of tightening steps to cont ain inflation and prevent th e economy from overheating. 
We received no reports of intervention purchas es or sales of dollars from the central 
banks of industrial countries over the intermeeting period.  The Desk did not intervene 
during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Fourth-quarter indicators of economic activ ity for the advanced foreign economies 
suggest that growth is deceler ating, and real GDP estimates for the third quarter were also 
revised down in Japan and the United Kingdo m.  Recent data on household expenditures 
and retail sales have weakened on balance a nd there are signs that the Japanese and 
Canadian labor markets are deteriorating. 
 
 
 
 
 Consumers and businesses are considerably le ss upbeat about growth prospects, possibly 
as a result of the ongoing financial turmoil and tighter credit conditions.  In Japan, 
concerns about the elevated level of oil prices  led to a decline in the business sentiment of 
large manufacturers, the first drop in three year s.  Business confidence fell to its lowest 
level in two years in the United Kingdom and economic sentiment continued to decline in 
the euro area. 
Consumer price inflation has been increasing, pushed up by hi gher oil prices and, in some 
cases, food prices.  However, excluding energy prices, inflation remained subdued at 
around 2 percent, except in Japan where prices continue to fall.  The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 25 basis points to 4 percen t on January 22.  Other central bank officials 
held their policy rate constant in the inte rmeeting period, but markets now expect a lower 
path of interest rates than they did at the time of the last Greenbook. 
In Japan , real GDP growth was revised down to 1.5 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, a 
reduction of more than 1 percentage point.   Growth was mostly driven by external 
demand for Japanese products.  Domestic demand, however, remained weak.  Private 
investment continued to dec line in the third quarter, alt hough less sharply than in the 
second quarter.  Residential investment in pa rticular exerted a signi ficant drag on growth 
due to a revision to the Building Standards La w introduced in late June that increased 
inspections of buildings to ensure that th ey meet earthquake resistance requirements. 
Moreover, consumption growth appears relatively fragile as wages continue to decline. 
The December Tankan survey indicated that business confidence of large manufacturers 
fell for the first time in three years amidst co ncerns regarding the leve l of crude oil prices. 
Confidence also fell among majo r nonmanufacturers in December, the second straight 
quarter of decline, as firms find it increasingly difficult to pass on cost increases from 
higher oil prices to consumers.

Some signs point to a weak ening in employment.  Although the unemployment rate 
inched down to 3.8 percent in November, the jo b offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of 
officially posted job openings relative to th e number of officially re gistered job seekers) 
fell to 0.99, its lowest level in two years.  The slide in earnings grow th steepened, as total 
cash earnings (which include bonuses) fell 1.2 pe rcent in November fr om a year earlier. 
 
 
 
 
 The nationwide headline consumer price in dex (excluding fresh food only) rose  
0.4 percent in November from a year earlier , the first increase in eleven months.  
However, the rise in the index was due to an increase in oil prices, as consumer prices 
excluding fresh food and energy fell 0.1 percent. 
In the euro area , recent indicators are consistent with slower growth in the fourth 
quarter.  Growth in the volume of retail sales declined in October and November, putting 
the average level of sales for those two months  was down nearly one percent from that of 
the third quarter.  Industrial production rebounded somewhat in October, but fell  
0.4 percent in November. 
Recent survey indicators unambiguously point to economic weakness.  The European 
Commission survey of euro-area economic sentiment fell in December for the seventh consecutive month, with declines in conf idence widespread across the industrial, 
consumer, and construction sectors.  Germ any’s IFO business climate index fell in 
December, after a brief rise in November, as firms took a bleaker view of current business conditions; the index has fallen in se ven of the past eight months.  Also in 
December, the euro-area services PMI cont inued to decline, while the manufacturing 
PMI edged down after an unexpected rebound in the previous month.  Both series are 
near their lowest levels in more than two y ears.  In contrast, the euro-area unemployment 
rate remained at 7.2 percent in December, the same rate as in November and the lowest 
since records began 15 years ago. 
The ECB’s survey of euro-area bank lending indicated a further tightening of credit 
standards in the fourth quarte r.  The percent balance of euro-area banks reporting a net 
tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises was 41 percent in  the fourth quarter, 
up significantly from 31 percent in the thir d, reflecting the deterioration of financial 
market conditions since the st art of the financial turmoil last summer.  The percent 
balance of euro-area banks reporting a net ti ghtening of credit standards for housing loans 
to households increased from 12 percent in the third quarter to 21 perc ent in the fourth.

Banks reported that the recent turmoil in cred it markets continued to hamper their access 
to wholesale funding over the past three months. 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 Driven by higher energy and food prices, the twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer 
price inflation rose almost one percentage point over the course of  the fourth quarter, 
reaching 3.1 percent in December, its highest level in six and a half years.  However, 
excluding energy and unprocessed food prices, inflation was a more modest 2.3 percent. 
In the United Kingdom, real GDP grew 2.5 perc ent (a.r.) in the four th quarter according 
to the preliminary estimate.  The expansion was supported by strong wholesaling 
activities, which partially offs et slower retail sales, as well as faster growth among 
transport, storage and communication industries.  The business services and finance sector, the largest contributor to the current economic expansion, grew a modest  1.7 percent, well below its 5.1 percent average over the previous year. 
The Bank of England’s Credit Conditions Survey  showed that lenders reduced corporate 
credit availability significantly in the fourth quarter, and that the avai lability of credit to 
households was reduced by more than lenders  had expected a quarter earlier.  The 
tightening of credit likely contributed to a further moderation of activity in the housing 
sector.  Gross mortgage lending fell 21 percent in the twelve months to December.  
Indicators of house prices were either flat or  posted mild declines in the fourth quarter. 
Consumer confidence slid in December as households were increasingly worried about 
the general economic situation.  The PMI for se rvices firmed slightly in December, but 
firms reported a contraction in outstanding bus iness activities for the third consecutive 
month.  Business confidence rose in January  after reaching a tw o-year low a month 
earlier. 
By contrast, the labor market continued to display much resilience.  The number of 
people employed was 175 thousand higher in the three months to November than in the 
previous quarter.  The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell for the 
fifteenth consecutive month in December.  Average earnings growth including bonuses 
remained moderate at  about 4 percent.

Overall price pressure has risen further sinc e last Greenbook.  The twelve-month rate of 
headline inflation remained n ear target at 2.1 percent in December.  However, the 
quarterly increase at an annual rate registered 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter, its fastest 
pace since 1995 pushed up by rising energy and food prices.  Moreover, producers prices 
increased 5.0 percent in the year to December, their fastest pace since 1991, as 
manufacturers passed on higher ma terial and fuel inputs costs. 
 
 
   In Canada , indicators for the fourth quarter sugg est that growth is moderating from the 
2.9 percent rate posted in the third quarter.  Monthly GDP in October rose 2.9 percent 
(s.a.a.r.), which would lead to 2.3 percent grow th for the fourth quarter if November and 
December grow at the average ra te of the first ten months of  the year.  However, limited 
post-October data indicated some additional slow ing at the end of the quarter.  Imports of 
machinery and equipment, a good indicator of fixed investment, fell 2.5 percent in 
November.  New motor vehicle sales, a tim ely indicator of consumer spending, fell  
2.9 percent in November; new motor vehicle sa les have fallen six out of the last seven 
months. 
Following very strong growth in November , private employment fell sharply in 
December, leaving private employment up a pa ltry 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter.  
Public sector employment continued its out sized gains throughout the fourth quarter, 
leading the overall employment to rise 0.8 percent.  The unemployment rate remained 
unchanged at 5.9 percent in December, a thirty-year low. The housing market appears to have weakened sl ightly over the past couple of months.  
Single-unit housing starts declined a mode st 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  
Twelve-month house price appreciation has slowed  from a peak of 12 percent in 2006 to  
6.1 percent in November.  Although movements in multi-unit housing starts have been 
volatile, they have remained roughly flat, on average, over the past two years. 
In November, the twelve-month ra te of consumer price infla tion increased slightly to  
2.7 percent.  The increase in inflation owed primarily to increasing energy prices.  Core 
inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of changes in 
indirect taxes, increased 1.7 percent in October and November.  The twelve-month 
growth rate of average hourly wages jumped sharply in December, reaching 4.9 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Incoming data for the emerging market economies in Asia suggest that the pace of 
expansion moderated in the fourth quarter.  Trade balances have declined in several countries as exports slowed.  Indicators have been a bit mo re mixed in Latin America but, 
on balance, also point to a slowing of grow th, notably in Mexico.  Headline inflation 
remained elevated in the developing world.  Although food price infl ation has retreated 
some from earlier peaks in a number of countri es, energy prices have accelerated of late. 
 
  
 
 In China , incoming data continue to point to a mo re moderate rate of growth than was 
seen in the first half of last year.  Exports fell about 7 percent (s.a .a.r.) in the fourth 
quarter and, with imports roughly unchanged, the trade surplus na rrowed to less than 
$250 billion at an annual rate.  Over the Oc tober-November period, the average level of 
industrial production rose 2½ percent (s.a.) from its third-quarter level, representing a 
slight deceleration.  Monthly fixed asset investment has been erratic, with its 
year-over-year growth rate spiking in October and then fa lling back in November to 
about 26 percent.  The value of outstanding lo ans in December was just ½ percent higher 
than at the end of October, reflecting guida nce issued by the government in November to 
cap bank lending.  Twelve-month growth of M2  also slowed in December from its pace 
in the past several months.  In contrast, retail sales continued to accelerate, rising 19 
percent in November from a year earlier. 
Twelve-month inflation rose further to near ly 7 percent in November due mainly to 
soaring vegetable prices.  In addition, non- food price inflation also registered a 
significant increase; the recent hike in govern ment-controlled retail fuel prices helped 
push non-food inflation to 1.4 percent, higher than its average pace of 1 percent in 
previous months.  Amid concerns over in flation, the government announced that it would 
temporarily control the prices of some basic necessities such as grain, meat, and cooking 
oil, whose prices had been market determin ed.  Additionally, the cen tral bank raised the 
bank reserve requirement ratio in December  and January by a cumulative 1½ percentage 
points to a record 15 percent for large banks.  In December, benchmark interest rates 
were also raised 27 basis point s to 4.14 percent for the one-y ear deposit rate and 18 basis 
points to 7.47 percent for the one-year lending rate.

 Recent indicators for India  have been mixed but, on bala nce, point to a continued 
moderation of activity in the fourth quarter.  Industri al production rebounded in the 
October-November period from a contraction in the third quarter.  However, exports 
declined, contributing to a widening of the tr ade deficit.  Data from December suggest 
that consumer price inflation has stopped d ecelerating and wholesale price inflation has 
begun increasing after reaching a trough in October, rising fr om 3.2 percent in November 
to 3.6 percent in December.

1 Newly-industrialized economies: Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan In the NIEs1, indicators suggest that  overall economic activity moderated in the fourth 
quarter of last year from strong growth in th e previous two quarters.  In Singapore, the 
advance unofficial estimate (not shown) i ndicates that fourth- quarter real GDP fell 
3¼ percent as activity in the volatile biomedical sector c ontracted and production of 
electronics slowed.  Elsewhere, growth of industrial production also slowed in South 
Korea and Taiwan.  Across the region, trade balances generally decreased as exports 
slowed and, in some cases, imports rose. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation remain ed elevated in the fourth quarter owing 
mostly to higher food and energy prices.  However, food price inflation has retreated in 
the most recent months from previous peaks as the earlier effect of  adverse weather has 
faded in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea.  Citing  inflationary pressures, the central bank 
of Taiwan raised its discount rate .125 pe rcentage points to 3.375 percent on December 
20, while the Bank of Korea left its benchm ark rate unchanged at the most recent 
monetary policy meeting on January 10.

 Data from the ASEAN-4  region indicate that growth ge nerally slowed in the fourth 
quarter.  Growth of industrial production soft ened, and with the exception of Thailand, 
trade balances decreased.  Across the re gion, higher food and energy prices pushed 
twelve-month consumer price inflation higher.  Despite the inflationary pressures, central 
banks in Indonesia and the Philippines lowered interest rates by 25 basis points to 
8 percent and to 5¼ perc ent respectively, in or der to support growth. 
Separately, the Philippines central bank announced measures to liberalize capital outflows to stem local currency appreciati on, raising the amount residents can invest 
overseas without prior approval and the amount  of foreign exchange individuals can buy 
without documentation.  The Bank of Thailand announced measures to further relax the 
capital controls it had instituted in December 2006, scrapping the $100 million limit on overseas investment by Thai companies and doubling to $100 million the limit parent companies can invest in and lend to overseas subsidiaries. 
Results of Thailand’s December parliamentar y elections indicate that the People Power 
Party (PPP), the party close to ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won a 
landslide victory.  It remained, however, uncertain whether the military regime and the royal palace would cease their i nvolvement in Thai politics.

 Data from Mexico  suggest that growth slowed in th e fourth quarter.  In October, the 
index of overall economic activity was lit tle changed.  Industrial production for the 
October through November period weakened.  Sa me-store sales (not shown) were also 
down recently, but the trade balance moved into  surplus in November, following a string 
of deficits.  The recently approved budget for 2008 calls for a 10 percent increase in real 
expenditures (1.2 percent of GDP), which wi ll provide some support to activity going 
forward.  Headline inflation fell back to 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 4 percent, 
the upper limit of the central bank’s target rang e, in the previous quarter.  Twelve-month 
core inflation readings continued to be  elevated at 4 percent in December. 
In Brazil , real GDP growth jumped to 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, boosted by 
domestic demand, notably investment, as external demand slowed.  Investment continued 
to soar, rising nearly 20 percent for th e second consecutive quarter, and private 
consumption expanded at a solid 6 percent pace.   Recent indicators for the fourth quarter 
have been mixed.  Industrial production was down in November, and the trade surplus 
narrowed in the fourth quarter, but capacity utilization rates have remained very high.  
Consumer price inflation remained elevated at 4.3 percent in the four th quarter as higher 
food prices continued to exert pr essure on headli ne inflation.

 In December, the Brazilian congress reje cted a measure introduced by the Lula 
government to extend the financials transacti on tax (CPMF), which expired at the end of 
the year.  The loss of revenues from the rem oval of the tax is estimated at $40 billion 
(about 2½ percent of GDP).  In response, th e government proposed in early January a 
controversial plan to cut spe nding and to raise the tax rates on capital gains and banks’ 
profit. 
Economic activity continued to be very strong in Argentina .  Third-quarter real GDP 
soared by nearly 12 percent, led by st rong gains in agricu ltural production and 
construction activity.  Data for the fourth quarter indicate that activity continued to 
expand solidly.  In October and November , industrial production was up, and the trade 
surplus widened significantly.  Consumer pr ice inflation, though el evated, moderated a 
bit to 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 8.7 percent in the previous  quarter.  There are 
allegations that Argentine authorities have c ontinued to tamper with  the consumer price 
data to understate th e rate of inflation.

 In Vene
zuela , new finance minister Rafael Isea a nnounced goals of 6 percent real GDP 
growth and 11 percent inflation by the e nd of 2008.  There are no hints that the 
government will tighten monetary and fiscal po licies, which have been expansionary and 
fueled growth.  Both headline and core infla tion continued to rise significantly, reaching 
22.4 percent and 28 percent, respectively, in December.  On January 1, as had been 
announced early last year as an anti-inflati on measure, the government introduced a new 
currency, the bolivar fuerte (“strong” bolivar, which is equa l to 1,000 bolivares).  In the 
parallel market, the bolivar fuerte stood at 5.45 per dollar in mid- January, well below the 
official value of 2.14 per dollar.  In his mid- January state-of-the-nation address, President 
Chavez stated that the unlimited term provi sion which was rejected by voters last 
December might be re-introduced in 2010, th ree years before the end of his term.

         In Turkey, third-quarter real GDP c ontracted due to significa nt cuts in government 
spending and drop in exports.  Incoming data suggest that growth rebounded in the fourth quarter.  Average industrial production for October and November was up significantly 
over the third quarter level as manufactu ring activity strengthened.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation continued to rise  in recent months, reaching 8.4 percent in 
December, significantly higher than the upper li mit of the central bank’s year-end target 
of 4 percent.  Nonetheless,  the central bank cut twice it s overnight borrowing rate by a 
total of 75 basis points to 15½ and its lendi ng rate by a total of 125 basis points to 
19½ percent.  The Monetary Policy Committ ee indicated that th e lagged effects of 
previous monetary tightening coupled with w eak aggregate demand will continue to exert 
downward pressures on inflation going forward.
