Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
II-1 The economy appears to have st alled this quarter following a very weak fourth quarter.  
Labor market conditions deteriorated at the beginning of the year, with private payroll 
employment contracting in February for the third month in a row.  Residential 
construction activity has conti nued its steep descent.  Consumer spending looks to be 
about flat this quarter, as ga ins in household wealth and real income have diminished and 
sentiment has slumped.  Business spending gene rally also appears to have been sluggish 
around the turn of the year, while forward-looking indicators such as business sentiment 
have soured, and manufacturing output has faltered.  Meanwhile, the acceleration in 
prices since the middle of last  year has continued, led by increases in food and energy 
prices.  Core inflation has also stepped up in recent months, although the twelve-month 
change in core prices in January remain ed slightly below what it was a year ago. 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand has deteriorated markedly in r ecent months.  In February, private payroll 
employment fell 101,000 following smaller job lo sses in the previous two months.  With 
the exception of nonbusine ss services, the recent employment  declines were widespread.  
Manufacturing payrolls decreased at an average rate of 41,000 per month so far this year, 
about twice the pace seen in th e second half of last year.1  Job losses in the temporary 
help industry also steepened over this pe riod, while employment in wholesale trade—
which often moves closely with  the manufacturing sector—t urned down.  Employment in 
the residential construction industry and relate d financial services i ndustries continued to 
decline in early 2008.  The av erage workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers 
on private nonfarm payrolls moved down to 33.7 hours in January and held at that level 
in February.  Accordingly, aggregate weekly  hours fell in January and edged down a bit 
further in February to a level 0.4 percent (not  at an annual rate) be low the fourth-quarter 
average.  
Turning to the household survey, the unemploym ent rate has averaged  4.9 percent over 
the past three months, up from 4.5 percent in the first half of last  year.  Most of the 
increase since that time is attributable to a rise in unemployed job losers.  The labor force 
participation rate moved down 0.2 percentage point in February, to 65.9 percent, and has 
changed little, on net, since last spring. 
                                                 
1 On February 26, about 3,600 UAW employees at American Axle & Manufacturing, a motor vehicle 
parts supplier for General Motors (GM), went on st rike.  By the week ending March 15—the reference 
week for the March payroll survey—GM anticipates th at it will have temporarily shut down a number of 
assembly and parts plants, idling between 20,000 and 40,000 workers.

Most other indicators of labor demand have w eakened of late.  In particular, the four-
week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance climbed further to 
359,000 for the week ending March 8, about 35,000 above the level that prevailed last 
fall; continuing claims for unemployment insurance also moved higher over this period.  
The most recent readings on net hiring plan s from Manpower and the National Federation 
of Independent Business (NFIB) point to a further slowdown in hiring, and the vacancy 
rate (job openings as a percent of private employment) in the Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover (JOLT) survey has moved lower in recent months.  In contrast, announcements 
of job cuts reported by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas have not shown the same 
deterioration as other indicat ors, and the rate of layoffs and discharges in the JOLT 
survey moved back down at the turn of  the year after rising in the fall.  
Measures of labor market tightness are also ge nerally consistent with a softening in labor 
market conditions since late last year .  Unemployment expectations in the 
Reuters/University of Michigan Survey ju mped in December and remained elevated 
through February, while respondents to the C onference Board survey reported that job 
availability continued to er ode through last month.  Afte r having moved down over the 
second half of last year, the fraction of firms reporting hard -to-fill positions has changed 
little in recent months, according to the NFIB.  
The staff estimates that output per hour in th e nonfarm business sector rose at an annual 
rate of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  Over the four quarters of 2007, productivity 
increased 2.9 percent, up  from 0.9 percent in 2006.2  Over the past four years, 
productivity growth has averaged 1.8 percent. 
                                                 
2 These nonfarm business productivity estimates re flect the BLS’s recent incorporation of the 
benchmark revision to nonfarm payroll employment, which led to an upward revision of 0.3 percentage 
point to the increase in productivity over the four quar ters of 2007.  Productivity in earlier years revised 
little.

3 As noted, parts shortages from the American Axle  & Manufacturing strike have caused a significant 
number of GM assembly plants in the U.S. to shut dow n.  We estimate that each week of lost production at 
the affected plants would reduce total production in March by roughly 175,000 units (annual rate) and 
would reduce the change in total IP by about 0.05 percent.  
Industrial Production  
The available indicators suggest that industrial production (IP) dropped back in February 
after having edged up in the pr evious two months.  Factor y output appears to have 
slipped last month, and utilitie s output fell sharply after a weat her-related rise in January.  
While weakness in the cons truction and motor vehicle sectors has restrained 
manufacturing output recently, r obust exports have provided a partial buffer.  Capacity 
utilization in manufacturing stood at 81.5 percent in Januar y, ¾ percentage point below 
the previous peak last July but still ½ percentage point above  its 1972-2007 average. 
The output of motor vehicles and parts moved down further early this year.  Total motor 
vehicle assemblies in January and February av eraged an annual rate of 10.1 million units, 
down about 400,000 units from their pace in th e fourth quarter of last year.  The 
automakers have been diligent in their efforts to keep production a ligned with sales.  
Thus, despite the recent step-down in sales, days’ supply of light vehicles in February 
remained near its historical average.  The latest production schedules, which do not 
incorporate the strike-related plant shutdowns at General Motors (GM),3 call for 
assemblies to edge up slightly in both Ma rch and the second quarter.  Elsewhere in 
transportation, commercial aircraft production co ntinued to rise at the beginning of the 
year, as Boeing prepares for the launch of its new 787 Dream
liner.

Output in high-tech industries  has increased moderately of late.  Semiconductor output—
MPU and non-MPU chips—has slowed since the mi ddle of last year, and domestic orders 
of printed circuit boards, a nonchip categor y of semiconductor IP, slumped further in 
January.  Strong consumer demand led to a jump  in unit sales of personal computers (PC) 
in the fourth quarter, but sa les of servers only edged up.  Elsewhere in high-tech, the 
output of communications equipment continue d to post solid gains in January after a 
strong fourth quarter. 
Forward-looking indicators suggest that high-t ech output will continue to increase but at 
only a modest pace.  Intel’s latest guidance fo r the current quarter points to little change 
in nominal revenue and is consistent with a moderate rise in real MPU production.  The 
International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that the pace of PC sales will slow this 
quarter, and recent anecdotal reports from la rge computer producers such as Hewlett-
Packard and IBM indicate that domestic demand has decelerated noticeably.  First-
quarter earnings guidance from Cisco, a la rge producer of high-end data networking 
equipment, suggests that demand for this category of communications equipment softened appreciably since the turn of the year. 
Outside of energy, transportation, and high- tech, production was lit tle changed in the 
three months ending in January, and the availa ble data suggest that  output declined in 
February.  Among the major market groups, prod uction of materials fell in January, as 
did production of construction supplies, whic h was 1.3 percent below its level a year 
earlier.  Supplies associated with residentia l construction were down more than 7 percent 
relative to their year-earlier level, while the production of supplies associated with 
nonresidential construction wa s little changed.  Elsewhere, consumer goods output 
declined for the fourth consecutive m onth in January, while business equipment 
production rose modestly. Near-term indicators of manufacturing activ ity generally suggest that production will 
remain sluggish, at best, over th e next few months.  In par ticular, the three-month moving 
average of real adjusted durab le goods orders was flat in January, the Institute of Supply 
Management’s (ISM) diffusion index of new orders stood below 50 for a third month in 
February, and the new orders indexes from regional surveys conti nued to decline, on 
balance.  On a more positive note, the staff’s series on announced layoffs in the 
manufacturing sector has remained at a rela tively low level the past several months.

Motor Vehicles  
The average pace of light vehicle sales stepped down in January and February to an 
average annual rate of 15.3 million units, or 800,000 units below the fourth-quarter pace.  
.  The available 
indicators of vehicle demand suggest that sa les will remain soft in the near term:  
Employment has fallen, real income gains have  been weak, and the Reuters/University of 
Michigan Survey index of car-buyi ng attitudes remained near its  historic low in February.  
Through the first ten days of March, the pace of sales at Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda was about the same as last month, a nd our contacts at the major domestic firms 
are also projecting flat sales for March. 
Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending has slowed in recent mont hs.  Nominal sales in the retail control 
category, which excludes sales at auto dealer s and building material and supply stores, 
moved down in February on sharply lower sa les at gasoline stations and weakness at 
most types of establishments.  Factoring in our estimate of PCE pri ces, real spending in 
the retail control category of  goods has now fallen at an average rate of 0.2 percent per 
month over the past three months.  As noted above, spending on motor vehicles has also 
sagged recently.  And, although r eal spending on services is reported to have increased 
solidly from November through January, part of  this strength reflected a jump in outlays 
for energy services, which was likely trans itory.  Moreover, the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis (BEA) lacks timely data on many cat egories of services consumption, and its 
estimates for these categories are often extr apolations of past trends that may not 
accurately reflect the recent pace of spending.
4 
The slowing in consumer spending likely refl ects the deterioration in its fundamental 
determinants and tighter credit conditions fo r some households.  House prices fell in the 
fourth quarter of 2007, and equity prices have declined appreciably si nce the start of this 
year; both developments point to a noticeable decline in the ratio of household net worth 
to disposable personal income (DPI) this quarter.  In addi tion, real DPI was unchanged in 
the fourth quarter, held down by higher pr ices for food and imported oil, and was 
reported to have only edged up in January despite a temporary boost from the BEA’s 
estimate of turn-of-the-year bonuses.  While in terest rates on credit cards and auto loans 
have edged down recently, industr y reports suggest that tighter standards in consumer  
                                                 
4 Consumer spending on services has been subject to noticeable downward revisions around the start of 
downturns in economic activity—for example, from late 1981 to early 1982 and then from late 1990 to 
early 1991.

loan markets are limiting some households’ a ccess to credit, which may be constraining 
their spending.  Despite that credit tight ening, the personal savi ng rate in January 
remained a shade below zero for the third st raight month, as households are apparently 
adjusting only slowly to th eir reduced purchasing power. 
Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Reut ers/University of Michigan and Conference 
Board surveys, deteriorated sharply in February on heightened concerns about current 
economic conditions and the near-term outlook.  The index from the Reuters/Michigan survey now stands 20 points below its le vel in midsummer and is around the lows 
reached in the early 1990s.  About two-thirds of Reuters/Michigan survey respondents said they expect business condi tions to be “bad” next year , and about half said they 
expect an increase in unemployment. 
Housing  
The sharp contraction in residential construction has conti nued into 2008.  Single-family 
housing starts fell another 5 percent in January —similar to the average rate of decline in 
the second half of last year—to an annual rate of 743,000 units.  Adjusted single-family 
permit issuance—generally a useful indicat or of current and future construction 
activity—also moved down in January and remained below starts.  Meanwhile, 
multifamily starts moved up in January from their unusually low reading in December 
but remained below the range that this seri es has occupied for the past ten years.  
However, recent multifamily permit issuance poin ts to a return to the low end of this 
range in the near term. 
Home sales also weakened further in the past  few months.  The Census Bureau’s estimate 
of new single-family home sales stepped down 3 percent in January following an average 
monthly decline of 4 percent in the fourth quarter.   
 
.  In the market 
for existing homes, single-family sales edged up 0.5 percent in January after having moved down at an average rate of 1 percent pe r month in the fourth quarter.  In addition, 
the index of pending sales agreements—which tends to lead sales of existing single-family homes by one to two months—suggests th at sales will be fl at in February and 
March. 
Because sales of new homes continued to fa ll sharply over the past six months, builders 
have made little progress in paring their bloated inventories.  Despite a 10 percent 
contraction in the inventory of new homes for sale over th e six-month period ending in

5 The stimulus bill signed into law on February 13, 2008, contained provisions allowing a temporary 
increase in the conforming loan limit to 125 percent of the median house price in a city (not to exceed 
$729,750).  This development has not directly affected rates paid by conforming borrowers, although rates 
quoted by lenders offering jumbo mortgages have reportedly been quite volatile as jumbo loan programs 
are being restructured to accommoda te the new regulations.  The stimulus bill also raised the limit on 
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans.  However, FHA's relatively strict underwriting standards will likely limit the number of households  that will benefit from this change. 
6 In contrast, the OFHEO’s all transactions price index (seasonally adjusted by Board staff) decreased 
at an annual rate of only ½ percen t in the fourth quarter.  This index includes home values based on 
appraisals for refinancings in additio n to purchases.  Appraised values are likely to be less accurate because 
they are not arms’ length transactions but rather  reflect lagged information on house prices. January, the months’ supply of unsold new home s remained more than twice as high as 
the upper end of the fairly ti ght range that it had occupied  between 1997 and the summer 
of 2005. 
On balance, financing conditions have rema ined hostile to housing demand.  The supply 
of credit for nonprime and nonconforming loan s continues to be extremely tight.  
Issuance of securities back ed by nonprime mortgages (which include the subprime and 
alt-A categories) suggests that originations of these types of  loans were quite rare in 
January and February.  Meanwhile, data fr om the Federal Housing Finance Board’s 
Monthly Interest Rate Survey suggest that the share of jumbo loans in prime mortgage 
originations was about 4 percen t in January, roughly half of its average share since early 
2006.  Moreover, spreads between rates for ju mbo and conforming thirty-year fixed-rate 
mortgages increased to around 100 basis point s at the beginning of the year—about 
75 basis points wider than the aver age spread between 2001 and mid-2007.5  Interest rates 
on prime conforming loans have also moved up recently, although they remain well 
below levels seen in the middle of last year.  
Price declines for existing homes steepened in  the fourth quarter of last year.  The 
purchase-only version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight (O FHEO) decreased at an annual rate of 5 percent in the 
fourth quarter after slipping at a 1½ percent pace in the third quarter.6  The ten-city 
version of the Case-Shiller repeat-sales price index—which includes houses financed by 
nonconforming loans and is more heavily con centrated in urban areas that had seen 
greater appreciation in earlie r years—plunged at an annual rate of more than 20 percent 
in December after declining at a 15 percent p ace over the preceding three months.  In the 
market for new homes, the constant-quality  price index fell at an annual rate of 
6¼ percent in the fourth quarter.  This declin e in new home prices is consistent with 
II-20 
anecdotal evidence that many large homebuild ers are resorting to price reductions, in 
addition to nonprice incentives, to bolster sales and unload inventory. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software has decelerated in recent months as business 
conditions have deteriorated a nd financial markets have tightened.  We estimate that, in 
the fourth quarter, real equipment and soft ware expenditures rose at a sluggish annual 
rate of 2 percent.  In January, orde rs and shipments of nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft stood above th eir fourth-quarter averages, but more-timely surveys of 
business sentiment have a darker cast. 
The subpar rise in spending on equipment and soft ware last quarter is broadly in line with 
that quarter’s sharp decelerati on in business output and the e ffect of higher interest rates 
on the user cost of capital.  Since then, business financing conditions have continued to 
worsen.  In particular, corporate bond yields  have increased, and spreads over Treasury 
yields have widened.  Furthermore, recent su rveys have shown a sharp deterioration in 
businesses’ assessments of economic c onditions.  After plunging in January, the 
Philadelphia Fed’s index of business activity  in the manufacturi ng sector edged down 
further in February, while a similar index from the Empire State manufacturing survey 
slumped last month.  In addition, the IS M manufacturing diffu sion index, which had 
ticked up in January, fell back in Februa ry to about its low December value. 
Real business outlays on tran sportation equipment fell in the fourth quarter; more 
recently, the data have been mixed.  A January increase in aircraft shipments and a step-down in exports suggest that domestic spending on aircraft will incr ease this quarter.  
Meanwhile, sales of medium and heavy trucks (classes 4 through 8) have been flat for 
several months after reaching a four-year low last year; the r ecent strength in truck orders 
suggests that truck sales will firm over the ne xt few months.  On the other side of the 
ledger, fleet sales of light motor vehicles de clined, on balance, in January and February, 
with much of the weakness due to lower sale s to daily rental firms; our contact at 
Chrysler reported that his firm plans to cu t back noticeably on these types of sales in 
2008. 
Real spending on high-tech equipment and soft ware rose at a solid annual rate of 
13½ percent in the fourth quarter.  However, this vigor does not appear to have been 
maintained past year-end: Weak shipments,  a steep decline in orders, and higher net 
exports in January point to only modest gains in  domestic spending this quarter.  Also, as 
noted earlier, anecdotes from large PC producer s indicate that some deceleration in the

pace of domestic demand for computers and pe ripherals is under way.  Moreover, Cisco 
is now reporting weaker demand for communications  equipment, particularly in the retail 
and transportation sectors. 
After having contracted at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, real 
business investment in equipment other than  high-tech and trans portation appears likely 
to step down again in the current quarter.  While orders and shipments rose briskly in 
December and moved up further in January, most of the January increase in shipments 
was exported.  Imports of this broad categor y of equipment fell in both December and 
January, a sign that domestic demand remains subdued.  
Nonresidential Construction 
On the heels of robust gains during most of last year, nominal spending on nonresidential 
structures decelerated in December and poste d an outright decline in January.  Although 
spending in this sector is quite volatile, the recent deceleration is consistent with 
mounting indications of slow ing demand for nonresidential  buildings and tightening 
credit conditions.  Vacancy rates in the retail sector continued to trend up in the fourth 
quarter, while increases in commercial property values have been slowing, even posting 
outright declines in some markets.  In  addition, the three-month average of the 
architectural billings diffusion index—wh ich is reasonably well correlated with 
construction spending six months hence—m oved down, on net, in the second half of 
2007. 
This sector is likely also fee ling the effects of financial turm oil.  The sharp contraction in 
issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securitie s in the fourth quarter of last year may 
signal a more general deterioration in fi nancing conditions.  Indeed, nonresidential 
construction contractors have indicated that funding has beco me more difficult to obtain 
in recent months, especially for more speculative projects.7  These responses are 
consistent with results from the January Seni or Loan Officer Survey, in which about 80 
percent of domestic banks reported tighten ing lending standards on commercial real 
estate loans over the preceding three mont hs.  Moreover, a marked increase in 
delinquency rates on nonresidential  construction loans held by banks in the fourth quarter 
suggests that a growing share of bui lders are under financial strain. 
The BEA reported that real expenditures on drilling and mining structures rose at an 
annual rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter  after unusually large in creases in the second  
                                                 
7 These responses were reported in a survey conduct ed by Associated General Contractors of America.

8 The magnitude of second- and third-quarter increases was surprising given the indicators we track; 
the BEA’s estimates reflect proprietar y information not available to the staff.  However, our indicators are 
consistent with the BEA’s reported increas e in investment in the fourth quarter. and third quarters.8  Data on drilling rigs in operation and on footage of new wells drilled 
suggest that investment in the cu rrent quarter will rise at a pace  close to that of the fourth-
quarter. 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventories excl uding motor vehicles increas ed at an annual rate of 
$12 billion in the fourth quarter, a rate of accu mulation similar to that registered in the 
first three quarters of last year.  The pace of stockbuilding was modest enough to keep the 
inventory-sales ratio flat la st quarter.  In the latest  book-value data, the ratio of 
manufacturing and trade inventor ies to sales remained at a relatively low level in January. 
Data from the staff’s flow-of-goods system indicate that the months’ supply of 
inventories for the major industry and market groups excluding moto r vehicles ticked up 
in January, but few indications of serious inventory imbalances are evident.  The months’ 
supply for construction supplies and materials dipped in January but remains moderately 
above its trend.  Meanwhile, the ISM custom ers’ inventories index stood at 49 in 
February, an indication that, on net, purchasing managers do not think their customers’ 
stocks of inventories are elevated. Federal Government Sector  
Federal spending has stepped up in recent months.  Outlays in January and February, 
adjusted for payment-timing shifts and fina ncial transactions, were almost 7 percent 
above the level recorded a year earlier.  Defense spending posted a 14 percent increase, 
and interest outlays rose about 10 percent, as  high readings on inflation boosted interest  
accruals on Treasury inflation-protected secu rities (TIPS).  The strength in defense 
spending in January and February suggests that  real defense purchases, as measured in 
the NIPAs, will pick up this quarter after ha ving been essentially flat in the fourth 
quarter. 
Receipts in January and February were a bit lower than in the comparable period last 
year, as robust inflows of non-withheld income  and social insurance taxes were offset by 
a pickup in individual and corporate income tax refunds.  Our information on refunds 
paid to date suggests that the IRS is processing them at about the same pace as last year.  
Evidently, the IRS was able to respond quickly  to the December enac tment of alternative 
minimum tax (AMT) relief legisl ation and avoided refund delays.

Given the recent strength in outlays and weakness in receipts, the budget outlook has 
deteriorated.  The federal budget deficit, adju sted for payment-timing shifts and financial 
transactions, was $134 billion in January and Fe bruary, up considerably from the adjusted 
deficit of $92 billion recorded dur ing this same period last year. 
In February, Congress passed a stimulus p ackage totaling $163 bill ion, which consisted 
of roughly $113 billion in tax rebates to house holds and $50 billion in bonus depreciation 
on business investment in 2008.  Rebates will range from $300 for low-income 
individuals to as much as $1,200 for middle-income and upper-middle-income couples, 
plus an additional $300 per child.  Accord ing to the Treasury Department, rebate 
payments will begin on May 1 and will be al most complete by the end of July.  The 
bonus depreciation provision allows firms to immediately depreciate an additional 
50 percent of the cost of most new equipment placed in service during 2008.  This provision lowers tax revenues from busine sses in 2008 and 2009 but raises tax revenues 
in later years as depreciation allowances are reduced. Consequently, th e total cost of the 
provision through 2018 is about $7 billion. 
The Administration released its proposed budge t for fiscal 2009 on February 4.  In that 
document, the Administration forecasted a budget deficit of around $410 billion in both 
the current fiscal year, 2008, and in fiscal  2009; the forecast assumed the enactment of 
the President’s proposa ls (which contained a somewhat smaller fiscal stimulus package 
than the one that was ultimately enacted).  The key near-term policy proposals include 
increased defense spending—mostly for m ilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan—
and a one-year extension of AMT relief.  
State and Local Government Sector 
The available data on the state and local sect or suggest that real purchases will rise 
somewhat less in the first quarter than duri ng the final quarter of 2007 because of weaker 
spending on construction.  Nominal outlays fo r state and local cons truction in January 
were 1 percent (not at an annua l rate) below their fourth-quarter  level.  In contrast, hiring 
appears to still be rising steadily:  State and local employment increased an average of 
25,000 per month in January and February, about th e same pace as in the fourth quarter.  
The NIPA data show a noticeable deteriorati on in the budget balances of state and local 
governments over the second half of 2007, a result of rapidly increasing nominal 
expenditures coupled with a slowing in rece ipts.  Press reports suggest that state 
governments are responding to the weakening revenue environment through a variety of

9 Our estimate for January is about one-tenth percentage point lower than the figure published by the 
BEA because we took account of data on medical pri ces from the January producer price index (PPI).  The 
PPI was released too late for the BEA to incorporate th is information, but will be folded into the revised 
estimates released at the end of March.  The tables an d charts in this section show the figures published by 
the BEA. measures aimed chiefly at fiscal 2009 budgets , including reducing the planned growth of 
expenditures, increasing taxes, and tapping into rainy-day funds. 
Prices  
Consumer prices have remained on a relativel y steep upward trajectory in recent months.  
We estimate that total PCE prices rose 0.3 percent in January af ter a similar-sized 
increase in the previous month.9  The twelve-month change in PCE prices through 
January stood at 3¾ percent, boosted by surges  in the prices of both food and energy.  
Excluding food and energy, the pace of PCE pr ice increases has stepped up from the low 
rates posted last summer.  Although long-term  inflation expectations appear to have 
increased since the fall, they remain broadl y in the range seen in recent years.  
We estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in January for the fourth consecutive 
month.  The increase in core PCE prices of 2¼ percent over the twelve months ending in 
January is slightly smaller than the increas e over the previous twelve months, but this 
twelve-month change masks an acceleration in prices since mid-2007:  Over the past six 
months, core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent, significantly above the 
1½ percent rate over the previ ous six months.  Prices of core goods, which had fallen 
through 2006 and most of 2007, have since reve rsed course.  The upt urn has been led by 
prices for apparel and prescrip tion drugs, which have risen sharply after large declines in 
early 2007.  Price increases in other goods categories also ha ve picked up since late 
summer, as have price increases for both market and non-market consumer services.   
After jumping substantially in the fall, PC E energy prices conti nued their upward climb 
in December and January.  Retail gasoline pr ices appear to have dropped back in 
February, as demand flattened and gasoline i nventories surged.  But by the end of the 
month, sharp increases in crude oil prices we re again pushing up gasoline prices.  Over 
the twelve months ending in January, consum er energy prices rose 23 percent—a striking 
turnaround from the decline registered over the previous twelve months. After slowing late last ye ar, PCE food and beverage inflation bounced back up to 
0.6 percent in January; the gain left the twel ve-month change in the PCE price index for 
food and beverages at 4¾ percent, consid erably higher than the 2½ percent increase 
recorded in the previous twelve-month peri od.  In large part, th e acceleration in food

prices reflects widespread increases in the prices of agricultural commodities.  Spot 
prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans moved up s ubstantially last year and have continued 
their run-up so far this year:  Soybean prices  have increased another 13 percent since the 
January Greenbook, corn prices are up 18 pe rcent, and wheat prices have risen 
28 percent.  The recent increase in wheat prices was especially pronounced because 
stocks—particularly for the spring wheat varieties used in pasta and related products—
are currently quite lean.  More generally, the rise in grain pr ices over the past year likely 
reflects a combination of increased ethanol production, demand from emerging market countries, weather-related disrupt ions, and high input costs.  In  contrast, spot prices of 
animal products, especially beef, pork, and dair y products, have turned down of late, as 
supplies have been expanding gradually in response to earlier high prices. 
The high readings on overall consumer price in flation in the past si x months appear to 
have contributed to a pickup in near-term inflation expectations ; as for longer-term 
expectations, the weight of the evidence suggest s that these expectati ons have also drifted 
up a touch recently.  As measured by the Reuter s/University of Michigan Survey, median 
expectations for year-ahead inflation moved up from 3.1 percent in October to 
3.6 percent in February, with half of this  change coming since the January Greenbook.  
Regarding longer-term expectations, increase s in the Reuters/Michigan measure of 
median inflation expectations over the next five to ten years have amounted to only two-tenths since October, with no change since late January ; the February reading of 
3.0 percent was close to its average level over the past coup le of years.  According to the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, expected inflation over the next ten years has edged 
up recently with both the CPI- and PCE-base d expectations rising one-tenth, although 
this uptick just reversed the downtick a year earlier.  Inflation compensation derived from 
TIPS has moved up more noticeably of late.  Five-year inflation compensation has risen 
0.3 percentage point since the January Greenbook after having declined from the fall until late January.  The five-year, five-year-ahead measure has also moved up 0.3 percentage 
point since the January Greenbook and is 0.4 pe rcentage point higher than it was in the 
fall. 
Strong global demand and higher prices for energy and other commodities have 
contributed to continued pri ce pressures at earlier stages of processing of late.  The 
producer price index for core intermediate ma terials rose ¾ percent in January after a 
cumulative increase of 1 percent over the previous two months.  Prices for energy-
intensive products, such as pl astics and agri cultural and i ndustrial chemicals, have 
increased sharply over the past few months, but  these gains have been offset, to some 
extent, by a downturn in prices  for lumber, plywood, and gypsum.  On balance, the index

10 Compensation per hour is now reported to have increased at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third 
quarter.  This figure incorporates information on compensation from third-quarter state unemployment 
insurance tax records, as well as information on hours from the BLS’s annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey. 
11 The BEA estimates that some of these bonus paym ents were made—and will show up as wage and 
salary disbursements —in early 2008, though they represent remuneration accrued  for productive activity in 
the fourth quarter of 2007.  The BLS measures compensation per hour on an accrual basis. for core intermediate materials increased 4 percent over the twelve months ending in 
January, about ½ percentage point more than in the preceding year. 
Commodity prices have risen signific antly since the January Greenbook.  The Journal of 
Commerce  index of industrial materials and the Commodity Research Bureau spot index 
of industrial materials have both jumped 8¼ percent since mid-January.  Over the past 
year, these indexes increased at a slightly fa ster pace than the 15 percent average annual 
increase registered since the current surg e in commodity prices began in mid-2002.   
Labor Costs 
Labor costs have continued to in crease at a moderate rate, w ith little sign, as yet, of 
higher price inflation passing through to higher compensation.  The employment cost 
index for hourly compensation of private-indus try workers rose at an annual rate of 
3.1 percent over the three months ending in December.  The twelve-month change was 
3.0 percent, about equal to its average pace over the previous couple of years.  Wages and 
salaries rose at a 3.1 percent rate for the third quarter in a row, while benefits costs 
accelerated slightly to a 3.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.  However, the twelve-
month change in benefits costs remains below the change in the previous year because of 
a significant decline in retirement  and savings costs in early 2007.  
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business s ector is estimated to have risen at an 
annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter and was up 4 percent for 2007 as a 
whole.10  This four-quarter change  is a step down from the 5 percent rate posted in 2006, 
which was boosted by the timing of large bonus payments.  Bonus payments appear to 
have been smaller this bonus season—though re cent reports suggest that these payments 
may not have been as small as early reports had indicated.11  After falling for the previous 
two quarters, unit labor costs are estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 2.8 percent 
in the fourth quarter.  For 2007 as a whol e, unit labor costs in creased 1.0 percent, 
significantly below the substa ntial rise observed in 2006.

1 The spread on asset-backed commercial paper edged up, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
However, the small increase understates to some extent the strains in that segment of the commercial paper 
market because the spread is measured relative to th e AA financial rate, which became elevated over the 
intermeeting period. Overview 
Concerns about the economic outlook and the exposure of financial institutions to further 
losses weighed on financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Late in the period, 
significant strains resurfaced in short-term  funding markets, prompting the Federal 
Reserve to take several steps to increase liquidity.  On net, investors marked down the expected path for monetary policy substant ially.  Two-year nomi nal yields declined 
markedly, while ten-year nominal yields fell less, thereby leaving the yield curve 
noticeably steeper.  Amid higher-than-expected  inflation readings and notable increases 
in oil prices, TIPS-based inflation compensati on rose across the term structure.  Broad 
equity market indexes declined, and corpor ate bond spreads widened to multiyear highs.  
Indicators of household credit quality show ed further deterioration, particularly for 
nonprime mortgages.  According to Call Repor t data, commercial bank profits in the 
fourth quarter of 2007 were at their lowest le vel since the early 1990s, in part because of 
a sharp increase in loan-loss provisioning. 
Money Market Functioning 
Conditions in some short-term funding markets deteriorated over the intermeeting period.  
Spreads of Libor and term federal funds rates over those on comparable-maturity 
overnight index swaps (OIS) jumped in late February amid renewed funding pressures.  
The spread on lower-rated nonfinancial uns ecured commercial paper also widened, on 
net, and asset-backed commercial paper outstanding contracted a bit.
1  In addition, 
dealers reported that liquid ity conditions in the commercia l paper market deteriorated 
because of concerns about the health of some financial institutions that provide liquidity 
and credit support to the mark et.  Starting in mid-February, repurchase agreements 
backed by agency and private-label mortgage -backed securities (MBS) also came under 
significant pressure, with reports of larger “haircuts” being applie d by lenders and news 
of market participants missing margin calls on positions. 
Consistent with a step-up in funding pre ssures, auctions through the Term Auction 
Facility (TAF) during the inte rmeeting period drew more demand than those immediately 
following the turn of the year.  On March 7, the Federal Reserve announced that it would 
increase the size of TAF auctions in Marc h from $30 billion to $50 billion, which will 
result in $100 billion of TAF credit outstandi ng, and that it would begin a series of

twenty-eight-day, single-tranc he, term repurchase agreemen ts that are expected to 
cumulate to $100 billion.  The first larger  TAF auction held on March 10 generated 
strong demand.  On March 11, the Federal Reserve announced an increase in the sizes of 
its swap lines with the European Centra l Bank and the Swiss Na tional Bank, and those 
central banks announced that they would draw on those lines to provide dollar funding as long as necessary.  In addition, the Federa l Reserve announced a new term securities 
lending facility that will allow primary d ealers to borrow as mu ch as $200 billion of 
Treasury securities from the portfolio of th e System Open Market Account (SOMA) for a 
term of twenty-eight days, collateralized  by agency debt, agency-backed MBS, and 
AAA-rated private-label MBS.  Following th ese announcements, Libor-OIS spreads and 
spreads in markets for agency-guaranteed  MBS over comparable maturity Treasury 
securities narrowed somewhat.  
 
 Yields on three-month Treasur y bills dropped over the intermeeting period, mostly 
because of downward revisions to policy ex pectations, but some safe-haven demands 
may have also pressured yields lower, as  the spread below comparable-maturity OIS 
widened somewhat in recent weeks, albeit to  not to the levels observed last August.  
Liquidity in the bill market was strained at some points during the intermeeting period, 
but has reportedly improved amid increased issuance, particularly at the shortest 
maturities.  The heightened demand for Treasury debt continued to be reflected in 
periodic downward spikes in  the overnight repurchase agreement rate for general 
Treasury collateral. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The Committee’s decision to lo wer the target fede ral funds rate 50 basis points at the 
January meeting elicited a modest general r eaction in financial markets, but near-term 
futures rates declined a few basis points, as investors had apparently placed some odds on 
a smaller easing.  The expect ed path of monetary polic y over the next two years 
subsequently shifted down substantially, on net,  as market perceptions of deterioration in 
the economic outlook and increasing concerns about the financial sector apparently outweighed higher-than-expected incoming readings on in flation and soaring energy 
prices.  The release of th e January FOMC meeting minutes produced little market 
reaction.   
Federal funds futures and options indicate that  investors are now virt ually certain of at 
least 50 basis points of easing at the Marc h FOMC meeting.  Furt her ahead, Eurodollar 
futures quotes suggest that inve stors expect the federal funds  rate to fall to around 1.75

2 Figure based on index levels as of market clos e on March 12.  Relative to the January Greenbook, 
stock prices are about unchanged. percent over the next half-year, and to rema in at that level until early 2009.  Implied 
uncertainty around the near-term policy path has fallen a touch since the January FOMC 
meeting and remains higher than before the ons et of the financial market turmoil.   
Consistent with the downward revision to  policy expectations, two-year nominal 
Treasury yields fell markedly; ten-year yields declined less, leaving the yield curve 
noticeably steeper.  Judging from TIPS yields , the change in the slope of the nominal 
yield curve largely reflected a steepening in th e term structure of real yields.  Inflation 
compensation rose across the term structur e, likely prompted by higher-than-expected 
inflation data, climbing oil prices, dollar depr eciation, and, perhaps, perceptions that the 
FOMC is especially focused on downside risks to growth.  Survey measures of inflation expectations also suggest higher expected  inflation as well as  greater inflation 
uncertainty.  
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes d ecreased about 4 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.
2  Stocks tumbled on negative economic news as well as concerns about the 
financial guarantors and the portfolios of fina ncial intermediaries, but recovered some of 
their losses on the day that the Federal Reserve announced the new term securities 
lending program.  The Dow Jones index of fina ncial sector stocks was especially volatile 
and substantially underperformed the broader market, but the indexe s for the energy and 
basic materials sectors rose somewhat on the surge in oil and other commodity prices.  
The spread between the twelve-month-forwar d trend earnings-to-price ratio for S&P 500 
firms and a real long-run Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—was little changed at the upper end of its range over the past two decades.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained  on the high side of the average for the 
past several months.  
Yields on BBB-rated and high- yield corporate bonds incr eased over the intermeeting 
period, despite the decline in Treasury yields, pushing their spreads to  the highest levels 
since 2002.  Near-term forward spreads are par ticularly wide, suggesting greater concern 
among investors about the outlook for corporate credit quality over the next few years.  
Spreads on corporate bonds rated A and AA increased to their highest levels in over a 
decade, likely a reflection of the high proporti on of financial firms with these ratings.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With fourth-quarter earnings reports nearly  complete, operating earnings per share for 
S&P 500 firms are estimated to have plunged more than 25 percent from year-earlier 
levels; huge write-downs by financial firms led to a large decline in that sector’s 
earnings.  In contrast, earni ngs per share for nonfinancial firms increased 13 percent on a 
year-over-year basis, and reports from most  nonfinancial S&P 500 firms met or exceeded 
forecasts.  Looking forward, year-ahead earnings for both financial and nonfinancial S&P 500 firms were marked down signifi cantly in January and February.   
 
 
 
 Data on nonfinancial corporate balance sheets for the fourth quarter of 2007 suggest that 
corporate credit quality is holding up.  The aggr egate ratio of liquid assets to total assets 
remained high by historical standards, and the aggregate leverage ratio stayed low.  The 
delinquency rate on C&I loans ticked up again in the fourth quarter but remained low.  In 
January, ratings changes for corporate bonds were sparse, and the realized six-month 
trailing default rate on corporate bonds c ontinued to hover near zero.  However, a 
forward-looking measure of credit quality, the KMV forecast of the aggregate year-ahead 
default rate, jumped in January.  
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was so lid in January and February, but nearly 
all the issues were rated i nvestment grade.  Outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper 
also expanded at a moderate pace, while growth in C&I loans stalled in February after a 
gain in January.  Aggregating across bonds, co mmercial paper, and C&I loans, net debt 
financing expanded at a modest p ace over the past two months.   
Net equity issuance was deeply negative in th e fourth quarter (the most recently available 
data), as public and private equity issu ance was dwarfed by equity retirements.  
Retirements from cash-financed mergers a nd acquisitions set a new record, largely 
because of the completion of a number of  blockbuster leveraged buyouts.  In 2008, the 
pace of merger completions has slowed, and very few large deals have been announced.  Repurchases remained strong in the fourth quarter, but the pace at  which new programs 
(from nonfinancial firms) have been a nnounced has moderated a bit this year.  
In January and February, gross public equity  issuance by nonfinancial firms was sluggish, 
with IPO activity particularly sparse in the f ace of lower and more volatile equity prices.  
Financial issuance was sizable, reflecting severa l large offerings of preferred shares from 
major financial institutions.

3 On February 27, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) lifted the portfolio 
caps on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and said it w ould consider gradually reducing the extra capital 
required because of the GSEs’ operational and internal control problems during the past several years.   Commercial Real Estate 
Conditions in commercial real estate credit markets have remained somewhat tight.  
Commercial mortgage debt grow th moderated a bit further in the fourth quarter.  Sales of 
commercial real estate dropped back sharply in  January and February after hovering in an 
extremely high range in 2007.  Spreads of yields on AAA-rated and BBB-rated 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMB S) over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities soared further over the intermeeting period amid continued concerns 
about high leverage on recently securitized mort gages and investor distrust of structured 
financial products in general.  Issuance of CMBS has been sc ant thus far this quarter.   
Fundamentals for existing commercial propert ies remained solid, on balance, in the 
fourth quarter, with lit tle change in the vacancy rate and growth in commercial rents 
staying fairly high.  Delinquency rates on CM BS and on commercial real estate loans 
held at life insurance companies were low in the fourth quarter.  However, delinquencies on commercial real estate loans held by co mmercial banks rose further on continued 
deterioration in the performance of loans funding commercial and residential 
development projects.  
Household Finance 
Residential mortgage debt dece lerated further in the fourth  quarter.  Loan performance 
continued to deteriorate; delinquency rates on subprime mortgages climbed steeply 
further, and delinquency rates on prim e mortgages reached multiyear highs. 
Credit default swap (CDS) premiums for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased to 
historical highs in the early months of 2008, likely reflecting continued concerns about 
mortgage credit quality and, relatedly, these firms’ announcements of substantial fourth-
quarter losses.
3  A heightened supply of agency-guaranteed MBS and higher required 
compensation for prepayment risk have pushed up spreads over Treasury yields in this 
market over the past several months.  In addi tion, in early March, diminished liquidity in 
the agency MBS market boosted spreads even further.  Spreads peaked on March 6 and 
have since fallen back a bit.   The increase in secondary market spreads, along with 
increased guarantee fees charged by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), 
pushed up interest rates in the primary market  for conforming mortgages.  Issuance of

4 Legislation enacted last fall reduced the subsidy to lenders providing loans through the Federal 
Family Education Loan Program. agency-guaranteed MBS, supported by an elevat ed pace of refinancing in late January 
and early February, was robust through mid-March. 
Conditions in the nonprime and prime jumbo mortgage markets remain very tight, with 
issuance of private residential MBS scant in  January and drying up in February.  The 
Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, signed into law in mid-February, included a temporary increase in the size of mortgage s in certain high-price areas th at can be securitized by the 
GSEs.  The GSEs announced that the newly conforming loans would be subject to an 
additional 25 basis point guarantee fee and mo re stringent underwri ting guidelines than 
standard conforming loans, including lowe r maximum loan-to-value ratios and higher 
minimum credit scores.  Rates quoted by lende rs on jumbo mortgages have been quite 
volatile in recent weeks as originators have  scrambled to redesign loan programs.   
Most delinquency rates on consumer loans have continued to m ove up and now stand 
near or above their historical averages.  C onsumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in 
January, with issuance of consumer auto, credit card, and student loan asset-backed 
securities (ABS) remaining solid through that  month.  However, issuance in all three 
categories declined somewhat in February.  In the secondary market for student loans, 
investors have considerably reduced their participation owing to concerns about complex securities and reduced federal governmen t support of public and private entities 
providing government-guaranteed loans.
4  Spreads on consumer loan ABS have risen 
notably further in recent weeks, although the available data suggest that retail interest rates on credit card and auto loans have not changed much. 
In the fourth quarter, OFHEO’s purchase-onl y index of national hom e prices dropped at 
an annual rate of 5 percent, the largest d ecrease since the start of  the series in 1991.  
Futures quotes indicate that over the intermeeting period ma rket participants sharply 
marked down the expected path of house pric es.  Given declines in housing and stock 
prices, the ratio of household net worth to disp osable personal income fell in the fourth 
quarter. Long-term mutual funds, which in January  experienced net outflows due to heavy 
redemptions of equity funds, recovered these losses with sizable inflows in February.  
Money market mutual funds experienced net in flows at the highest pace on record in

 nominal terms this year through early March, a su rge prompted in part by investors’ shift 
toward relatively safe assets. 
Treasury Finance 
The five- and ten-year secu rities auctioned at the Treas ury’s midquarter refunding in 
February were received well, but demand in  the auctions for two-year notes and 
thirty-year bonds was below average.  Measures of foreign demand for Treasury 
securities were somewhat mixed, with indirect  bidding at the auctions down a bit further 
but custody holdings of Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York up 
modestly.  The Treasury noted that it expects to increase bill issuance, and possibly 
nominal coupon issuance, in th e coming months to address its projected increase in 
borrowing needs. 
Liquidity in the market for Treasury coupon secu rities has remained somewhat impaired.  
Bid-ask spreads have stayed higher than they were before the onset of financial turmoil 
last year, and the on-the-run prem ium for the ten-year note rose in February to its highest 
level since 2002.  Borrowing of Treasury secu rities in the SOMA Securities Lending 
Program stayed near record levels.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds slowed in January and February.  Although 
a moderation is typical early in  the year, issuance was also likely damped by the troubles 
facing financial guarantors.  Hi storically, these guarantors have  insured about half of all 
municipal bonds; this share has declined recently.  Issuance of short-term bonds has been 
light as of late, an indicati on that most state and local governments are not experiencing 
substantial near-term funding pressures. Relatively few municipal bonds saw ratings changes in February after a spike in downgrades in January associated with a major financial guarantor being downgraded 
from AAA to AA, which lowered the ratings on most of the bonds it insured.  The likelihood of an even larger wave of m unicipal bond downgrades was reduced when 
Standard & Poor’s confirmed AAA ratings in late February on  the two largest bond 
insurers. 
Even so, yields on long-term municipal bonds have jumped in recent weeks, reportedly 
reflecting some reluctance of dealers to provi de liquidity and an unusually large volume 
of sales from leveraged invest ors.  As a result, the ratio of municipal bond yields to 
comparable-maturity Treasuries has shot up, reaching record levels.

 Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at an annual rate of 17 percent in February.  Retail money funds extended 
their blistering advance, likely reflecting continued safe haven demands.  Following a slight boost in January from tax-related fl ows, liquid deposits accelerated markedly in 
February as the drop in market rates resu lting from the monetary policy easing trimmed 
their opportunity cost.   
Growth of commercial bank credit moderate d in January and February.  C&I loans 
decelerated markedly from th eir torrid fourth-quarter pace, mainly at large banks.  
Growth of these loans was likely damped  by a reduction in merger and acquisition 
activity, weak business spending, and fewer previously committed loan deals coming 
onto banks’ books.  The February Survey of  Terms of Business Lending suggests that 
spreads of C&I loan rates ove r banks’ cost of funds rose in the curren t quarter.  
Commercial real estate loans advanced relatively briskly ag ain over the first two months 
of the year, and loans secured by residential real estate cont inued to expand modestly.  
Consumer loan growth stayed moderate.   
According to the fourth-quarter Call Re ports, commercial bank profits plunged last 
quarter.  The decline was concentrated at larg e banks and was driven in part by a jump in 
provisioning for loan losses.  The delinquency rate on all loans and leases increased to a 
level only a little below its recent peak in 2002.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $58.2 billion in January after narrowing to 
$57.9 billion in December.  Exports rose sharply in both months, while imports dipped in 
December before recovering in January.   
 
 
 
In January, the value of exported goods and services increased 1.6 percent, following a 
similar increase in December.  The January gain reflected higher exports of both goods 
and services.  Within goods, exports of agricultural products and consumer goods 
exhibited robust growth, while exports of industrial supplies increased at a more 
moderate pace.  In contrast, exports of capital goods fell sharply, led by a decline in 
exports of aircraft, and exports of automotive products were flat.    
 
The value of exports in the fourth quarter rose by 12.6 percent (a.r.), helped by robust 
growth in December.  Exports of services increased strongly in the quarter.  The quarterly 
increase was also supported by strong gains in exports of industrial supplies and capital 
goods, which more than offset a fall in exports of automobiles and consumer goods.  
According to the Preliminary NIPA release, real exports of goods and service increased at 
an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  This number is likely to be revised up 
somewhat when recent revisions to the trade data are incorporated.   
 
IV-2 
 
IV-3 
 
 
 
IV-4 
The value of imported goods and services rose 1.3 percent in January, reversing a 
similarly sized decline in December.  Imports in January were importantly boosted by a 
large increase in the value of oil imports, reflecting both an increase in price and a jump 
in volumes.  Non-oil imports recorded a steep decline, with imports of consumer goods 
falling the most. Imports of industrial supplies and capital goods also fell back slightly, 
whereas imports of services, foods, and automobiles all showed moderate gains. 
 
    
 I
n the fourth quarter the value of imported goods and services increased 12.6 percent 
(a.r.), despite December‟ s sharp decline.  A large increase in the value of imported oil 
resulting from higher oil prices significantly boosted import growth in the quarter.  
Services imports also exhibited strong growth, while imports of non-oil goods fell back.  
Imports of non-oil industrial supplies and automotive products declined sharply in the 
quarter.  In contrast, imports of consumer goods exhibited strong growth, while imports 
of capital goods increased slightly.  As reported in the Preliminary NIPA release, real 
imports of goods and services declined at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  As with exports, this figure will likely be revised up, reflecting recent data 
revisions.     
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In the first two months of 2008, core import prices rose sharply, 
boosting their average level 7¼ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter level.  Most of this 
increase was due to higher prices for material-intensive goods, which were up nearly 
17 percent.  Prices for nonfuel industrial supplies rose 17¼ percent, largely reflecting 
sharpl
y higher prices for imported chemicals.  For imported food, the average level of 
prices in the first two months was 15½ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter average.  
Over the
 same period, prices for finished goods increased 3 percent, with prices for 
ca
pital goods excluding computers and semiconductors, consumer goods, and automotive 
products all rising at about that pace.  
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 4.8 percent in January, and then fell 
1.5 percent in February.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil 
ave
raged $92.95 per barrel in January.  Since then, however, the spot price of WTI has 
surged, rising 20 percent to $109.92 per barrel as of March 12.  The price of futures for 
delivery at the end of 2016 has also risen considerably, closing at $102.91 per barrel on 
March 12, about $15 higher than at the time of the January Greenbook.  The higher price 
of oil
 likely owes to a confluence of factors, including increased geopolitical risk, 
potentially stronger demand, and the recent fall in the value of the dollar.

IV-7 
Exports.  The average level of core export prices in the first two months of 2008 was 
11¼ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter level, as prices of material-intensive goods 
soared 21 percent and prices of finished goods rose 3 percent.  The large increase in 
material-intensive goods reflected a 44½ percent increase in prices for agricultural 
exports combined with a 14 percent increase in prices for nonagricultural industrial 
supplies.  Prices for agricultural exports have risen briskly so far this year because of 
higher prices for wheat, corn, and soybeans, which all have recently reached record 
highs.  Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies are up, mostly because of higher 
prices for chemicals, fuels, and metals.  Within finished goods, the category with the 
largest increase was capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors, which rose 
3¾ percent.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the last Greenbook, we have received data on U.S. international financial 
transactions for December and January.  The unusually weak foreign official inflows 
during the third quarter of 2007 (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Financial 
Transactions Table) were followed by record inflows during the fourth quarter, and for 
the year as a whole, foreign official inflows were nearly as strong as in 2006.   
 
.  Official net purchases of U.S. 
Treasuries accounted for only a little over 10 percent of total official inflows in 2007, 
down sharply from 2006, with most of the acquisitions focused on agency securities, 
corporate bonds, and stocks.  In January 2008, foreign official flows registered a record 
monthly inflow of $101 billion, with strong inflows in all types of U.S. securities.  In 
both December and January, sizable acquisitions of stocks and corporate bonds largely 
reflected the well-publicized capital injections into U.S. financial firms from sovereign 
wealth funds of China, South Korea, Singapore, and Middle East oil exporters.  Partial 
and confidential data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that foreign official inflows 
likely moderated somewhat in February from January‟s  very high level.  
 
The chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows offers more perspective on these data.  
Flows from G-10 and OPEC countries have fluctuated between small inflows and 
outflows since 2006, with the trend being a fairly small net inflow.  Inflows from other 
countries have continued to account for the greater part of official inflows, and have 
experienced significant volatility in the past few months. 
 
Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the table and the top panels of 
the chart on Private Securities Flows) for 2007 as a whole registered a 10 percent 
increase from 2006, mainly because of very strong inflows during the first half of the 
year.  With the start of the financial market turmoil in the third quarter of 2007, however, 
private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities fell sharply, with foreign net sales 
recorded for agency bonds, corporate and municipal bonds (a category that also includes 
asset-backed securities), and corporate stocks (lines 4b, 4c, and 4d of the table).  Net 
outflows in these categories were offset by increased purchases of U.S. Treasuries (line 
4a), indic ating a „flight to quality‟ in private foreign demand for U.S. securities.  Private 
purchases of corporate securities recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter, while 
purchases of U.S. Treasuries rose even further.  In January, foreign private purchases of 
all security types were small. 
 

IV-9 
After recording strong outflows in the third quarter, U.S. net acquisitions of foreign 
securities (line 5 of the table and bottom panel of the chart on Private Securities Flows) 
contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the year as whole, U.S. net 
acquisitions of bonds and stocks (lines 4a and 4b) were somewhat smaller than those 
recorded in 2006.  During December 2007 and January 2008, U.S. purchases of foreign 
stocks were minimal.  Total U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in January were 
similar to the monthly average of 2007. 
 
 As is typical at a monthly frequency, flows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) were 
volatile in 2007, with a net outflow of $75.8 billion for the year.  In January 2008, 
banking offices in the U.S. recorded modest outflows of $36.7 billion.  Some of these 
outflows may be linked to U.S. banks providing liquidity to European banks, particularly 
via repurchase agreements. 
Complete U.S. balance of payments data for the fourth quarter are not yet available.  
However, some partial data have come in, including changes in bank-reported foreign 
currency denominated claims and liabilities, as well as changes in U.S. investors‟ 
holdings of foreign short-term securities.  These flows, which will be included in line 10, 
indicate a further $100 billion in inflows during the fourth quarter in addition to the 
nearly $300 billion in inflows recorded for lines 1-5, suggesting that the statistical 
discrepancy will likely swing from positive $86 billion in the third quarter to a sizable 
negative number in the fourth quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets 
Market turmoil stepped up again in late February, in part as investor perceptions of the 
near-term prospects for U.S. growth declined further.  Less-downbeat economic data in 
the other advanced economies and statements by some foreign officials warning of 
inflationary pressures led investors to expect that the Federal Reserve‟s monetary policy 
response would be more substantial than that of other major central banks.  As a result, 
the exchange value of the dollar dropped on net over the intermeeting period, with the 
trade-weighted major currencies index falling 3¾ percent to a new post-Bretton Woods 
low.  The dollar depreciated 5 percent against the euro and 6 percent versus the yen over 
the period.  The dollar depreciated 2¼ percent against sterling and was little changed on 
net versus the Canadian dollar.  
 
The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada lowered their policy interest rates during 
the intermeeting period, by 25 and 50 basis points respectively, while the European 
Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left their policy rates unchanged.  ECB President 
Trichet, after the March 6 meeting of the Governing Council, again emphasized his 
concerns about inflationary pressures.  Similar concerns, driven in part by sharp increases 
in the prices of many commodities over the period, led the Reserve Bank of Australia and 
Sweden‟s Riksbank to increase their policy rates.  
 
Conditions in interbank term money markets for dollar and sterling, which had improved 
substantially in January, deteriorated again in late February, and spreads between Libor 
and overnight index swap rates began to rise again.  Although spreads in euro held fairly 
steady through February, they also turned up in early March as lending conditions 
continued to deteriorate.  On March 11, as part of a set of coordinated actions by G-10 
central banks designed to help calm term funding markets, the FOMC announced that it 
would increase the size of its dollar swap lines with the ECB and the Swiss National 
Bank, and the ECB and SNB announced they would resume their dollar auctions and 
increase their size.  Simultaneously, the Bank of England announced the continuation of 
its three-month repo operations with an expanded list of acceptable collateral, and the 
Bank of Canada announced that it would conduct two exceptional 28-day repo 
operations.  Following these announcements, the spread between dollar Libor and OIS 
rates declined, but euro and sterling spreads showed little reaction. 
 
In line with expectations of divergent monetary policies, two-year Treasury yields fell 
about 80 basis points on net over the period, while German two-year yields declined only 
20 basis points.  Ten-year sovereign nominal yields declined about 30 basis points in 
IV-14 
Germany and 20 basis points in the United States.  In European sovereign bond markets, 
market liquidity has reportedly worsened since late February, and spreads between less 
liquid Italian bonds and more liquid German bonds have widened about 25 basis points.  
European corporate spreads have also moved up over the intermeeting period, although 
by less than in the United States.  
 
Amid growing concerns about the impact of the global financial turmoil and the pace of 
U.S. economic activity, major headline equity indexes in Europe, Japan, and the United 
States ended the period down 3 to 8 percent on net.  Financial sector share prices 
registered more substantial falls in most major industrial countries.  Euro-area banking 
share prices dropped about 10 percent on average, and Japanese banking share prices lost 
almost 15 percent despite a report by Japan‟s FSA indicating that Japanese banks have 
only a modest total exposure to U.S. subprime-based assets.  Market analysts were 
focused over the period on the releases of earnings reports by major European banks, 
watching in particular for the amounts written down by the various institutions.  The 
picture was mixed, as some European banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Cred it 
Agricole reported larger-than-expected writedowns, but a number of others, including 
HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays reported smaller-than-expected writedowns. 
 
Latin American financial markets were relatively unaffected by the global financial 
turmoil.  The dollar was little changed against the Mexican peso and depreciated 5 
percent versus the Brazilian real.  Equity indexes in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina rose 2 
to 6 percent.  Latin American dollar-denominated bond spreads widened slightly.  In 
emerging Asia, dollar exchange rates were mixed, as were movements in equity indexes; 
Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai indexes rose, but indexes in China and Hong Kong 
declined. 
 
We received no reports of intervention purchases or sales by the central banks of majo r 
industrial countries over the intermeeting period.  The Desk did not intervene during the 
period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Real GDP growth slowed in the fourth quarter in the major advanced foreign economies.  
The source of the slowdown varied substantially across economies.  In the euro area, 
GDP growth was pulled down by an outright fall in domestic demand.  Domestic demand 
also slowed in the United Kingdom.  In contrast, Canadian domestic demand remained 
very strong, but was offset by a steep decline in net exports. 
 
Except in Canada, consumer price inflation has risen in these economies over the past 
several months, pushed up by higher food and energy prices.  In the euro area, inflation 
pressures are particularly acute; overall inflation reached 3.2 percent in February, the 
highest level since euro-area statistics were officially compiled in 1997.  Core inflation in 
Canada continued to moderate in January, reaching 1.5 percent. 
 
Statements accompanying central bank meetings in March cited increased downside risks 
to growth.  The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 50 basis points at its March meeting, 
citing downside risks to growth emanating from the United States.  The Bank of England 
cut its policy rate 25 basis points in February.  The European Central Bank and the Bank 
of Japan left rates unchanged, indicating concerns over inflationary pressures outweighed 
risks to growth.  
 
According to the preliminary estimate, Japan 's real GDP grew 3.5 percent (s.a.a.r) in the 
fourth quarter, spurred by export growth and strong business fixed investment, which 
bounced back following four quarters of decline.  Net exports contributed 1.8 percentage 
points to growth, despite a decline in exports to the United States.  The revisions to the 
Construction Standards Law implemented last summer continued to weigh on housing 
investment, which subtracted about one percentage point from growth.  However, the 
Ministry of Finance corporate survey is at odds with the recent strength in business 
investment, suggesting that the fall in capital investment that started earlier in 2007 
accelerated in the fourth quarter, as private capital expenditure fell 7.7 percent from a 
year earlier.

Recent economic indicators have been mixed.  Industrial production and core capital 
goods shipments fell in January.  Consumer confidence also dropped in February to its 
lowest level in almost five years.  However, consumption indicators remain healthy, with 
strong increases in January retail sales and household spending.  Real exports also rose in 
the first month of this year, boosted by strong demand from Asia and the Europe. 
 
The labor market continued to be tight, with the unemployment rate unchanged at  
3.8 percent in January.  However, the job offers- to-applicants ratio (the number of 
officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) 
remained at 0.98, its lowest level in two years, indicating that employment may soften.  
Total cash earnings (which include bonuses) grew 1 percent in January from a year 
earlier, following 13 months of declines. 
 
The nationwide headline consumer price index (excluding only fresh food) rose  
0.7 percent in January from a year earlier.  However, the rise in the index was the result 
of an increase in oil prices; consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy fell 0.1 
percent.

Euro-area real GDP growth slowed to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  Total domestic 
de
mand fell 0.1 percent as private consumption contracted and investment growth 
slowed.  Net exports contributed 1.7 percentage points to growth, although this largely 
reflects a decline in imports.  The fourth-quarter slowdown in euro-area growth was 
driven by slowing growth in both Germany and France, which together account for 
around 50 percent of euro-area GDP. 
 
Recent survey-based indicators point to a further slowing of growth in the first quarter.  
The European Commission survey of euro-area economic sentiment fell in February for 
the ninth consecutive month, with declines in confidence widespread across the 
industrial, consumer, and construction sectors.  Germany‟s IFO business climate index, 
although remaining at a low level, unexpectedly rose in February, as firms took a slightly 
less gloomy view of current conditions.

The final reading on the euro-area services PMI for January declined about 3 points to 
50.6 before bouncing back to 52.3 in February.   The manufacturing PMI has been about 
unchanged over the past three months after recovering from a sharp drop in October.  
Retail sales and industrial production improved in January. 
 
According to the preliminary estimate, headline inflation was 3.2 percent in February, 
unchanged from January and its highest level since euro-area statistics began in 1997.  
Recent headline inflation has been boosted by rising energy and food prices.  January 
core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) was a more modest 2.3 percent.   
 
In the United Kingdom , real GDP  growth moderated to 2.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth 
quarter.  Domestic demand weakened noticeably as private consumption rose and 
investment contracted.  Net exports made a positive contribution to GDP growth, as 
imports fell more than exports.  Inventories and government consumption also made 
positive contributions. 
 
 
 
Recent data on mortgage lending are consistent with a sharp reduction in new loan 
origination.  Net mortgage lending fell 25 percent in the twelve months to January,  while 
the number of mortgages approved for house purchases tumbled 39 percent.  In contrast, 
mortgage refinancing posted double-digit gains over the same period.  Twelve-month 
house price appreciation has slowed from double digit gains last summer to around 
2 percent in February.   
IV-27 
Consumer confidence slid to a five-year low in February as households were increasingly 
pessimistic about the general economic situation.  In contrast, business confidence rose in 
January after reaching a two-year low a month earlier.  The PMI for services rose to 54.1 
in February as firms reported an increase in outstanding business and were more 
optimistic about future business. 
 
The labor market remains robust, with wages up and unemployment remaining low in 
January.  The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell for a sixteenth 
consecutive month in January, and the number of vacancies remained at its highest level 
since 2001. 
The twelve-month rate of headline inflation  ticked up to 2.2 percent in January.  
Excluding energy, food, and alcoholic beverages, inflation slowed 0.1 percentage points 
to 1.3 percent.

In Canada , real GDP growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, with most of the 
weakness appearing late in the quarter.  Net exports subtracted from growth as exports 
fell and imports rose.  Final domestic demand accelerated, as private and government 
consumption soared.  Growth in private consumption was especially impressive as it 
occurred before a January reduction in the retail sales tax.  Inventory accumulation made 
only a modest contribution in the fourth quarter following an outsized gain in the third.  
Investment growth was solid.
 
 
Employment increased substantially in both January and February, 0.3 percent in each 
month.  In contrast to the pattern seen throughout 2007, employment growth was 
concentrated in the private sector.  Consistent with the gains in employment wages have 
increased at record rates, near 4.9 percent on a twelve-month basis.   
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation fell 0.2 percentage points to 
2.2 percent in January.  Inflation has been supported by rising gasoline prices and 
increases in mortgage interest costs.  Core inflation, which excludes the eight most 
volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, slowed further in 
January, reaching 1.4 percent.  The twelve-month growth rate of average hourly wages 
jumped sharply in December, reaching an impressive 4.9 percent.   
 
The Bank of Canada lowered its policy rate by 75 basis points over the quarter; a 25 basis 
point reduction in January was followed by a 50 basis point reduction in March.  The 
BOC cited concerns over downside risks to its outlook driven by a likely further slowing 
IV-30 
of activity in the United States.  The BOC indicated that further stimulus “is likely to be 
required in the near term.”

Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Recent information for emerging market economies suggests that growth has slowed, but 
is still fairly strong.  In emerging Asia, fourth-quarter GDP data were mixed, as growth 
picked up in China and South Korea but moderated in India and contracted in Singapore. 
Indicators point to a slowing of growth in Latin America, but by less than had been 
expected, especially in Mexico.  Headline inflation continued to rise in the developing 
world, largely owing to a continued increase in food and energy prices, and prompting 
governments in several countries to adopt controls on some prices.  In addition, a number 
of countries have refrained from following the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and 
some, including China, have been allowing more currency appreciation.  
 
In China , real GDP grew 9.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, up somewhat from 
the third quarter.  Nevertheless, the pace of growth in the second half slowed markedly 
relative to the very strong first half, although new seasonal factors suggest that growth 
was spread a bit more evenly over last year than previously thought.  Incoming data from 
the current quarter continue to suggest weakness in external demand.  For January and 
February as a whole, export growth slowed a bit more after a substantial decline in the 
fourth quarter.  However, import growth also slowed, resulting in a modest increase in 
the trade surplus to $261 billion (s.a.a.r.) from about $251 billion in the fourth quarter.  
According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2007 China recorded its first overall fiscal 
surplus (including both central and local governments) in many years, reflecting strong 
tax revenues; the central government alone posted a modest deficit of under 1 percent of 
GDP.  
   
Twelve-month consumer price inflation has risen sharply this year, reaching 8.7 percent 
in February.  The rise in inflation largely reflects an acceleration of food price inflation : 
severe snowstorms disrupted transport and the inclement weather has caused some crop 
damage as well, leading to soaring vegetable prices and further increases in meat prices. 
12-month food price inflation increased to 23 percent in February, while non-food 
inflation remained at around 1½ percent. 
 
IV-33 
 
 
Recent indicators for India  show a moderation of activity.  Fourth-quarter GDP 
moderated significantly, after a marked increase in the third quarter.  Industrial 
production rebounded in December from the previous month, although growth in mining 
and energy production slowed significantly.  The trade deficit widened sharply in 
January, as soaring imports swamped a slight increase in exports.  Both consumer and 
wholesale price inflation held roughly steady in January.  However, more recent weekly 
data for the wholesale price index indicate a renewed increase in inflation in February, in 
part driven by higher prices for some food products and cotton.  In addition, the 
government increased the ceiling on state-controlled fuel prices by 5 percent on  
February 14.   
 
Leading up to the start of the new fiscal year in April, the government announced its 
proposed 2008-09 budget in late February.  Expenditure is heavily loaded toward 
education, health, and infrastructure, and agriculture.  The government projects a 2008-09 
fiscal deficit of 2½ percent of GDP, but analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the 
significant off-budget spending (possibly exceeding 2 percent of GDP).  In February, the 
government also took steps to allow greater capital outflow, giving firms the option of 
issuing foreign-currency exchangeable bonds to fund operations abroad.

In the NIEs1, fourth-quarter economic performance was mixed, as real GDP growth was 
strong in South Korea and Hong Kong, but moderated in Taiwan, and was negative in 
S
ingapore.  Contributions of external demand to growth generally weakened.  In 
Singapore, the contraction resulted primarily from a sharp decline in activity in the 
volatile biomedical sector.  In January, industrial production rebounded in Taiwan,  
Singapore and South Korea.  Across the region, exports have generally risen in the  
current quarter, but except in Singapore these gains have been largely offset by strong 
imports, resulting in lower trade balances.  
 
Ex
cept in Singapore, twelve-month consumer price inflation stabilized in most recent 
months across the NIEs, but inflationary pressures remain.  Food price inflation has 
retreated from previous peaks in South Korea and Taiw an, as the earlier effects of 
a
dverse weather have faded.  In Singapore, inflation picked up, owing mainly to a one-off 
technical revision in the measurement of accommodation costs.  Amid inflationary 
pressures, the central bank of Taiwan allowed the local currency to appreciate at a more 
rapid pace, while South Korea announced some anti-inflationary measures, including a 
10 percent reduction in the tax on gasoline and other oil products and a freeze of public 
services and transportation fees.  On February 1, Taiwan decided to extend for another 
six months a measure enacted last year to keep lower tariff rates on several farm 
products.

Data from the ASEAN-4  region indicate that economic growth slowed in Indonesia and 
Malaysia but picked up in the Philippines and Thailand in the fourth quarter.  Despite 
wea
kening demand in Europe and the United States, economic indicators have generally 
remained robust in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of strengthening domestic 
consumption and increased regional trade.  Industrial production, on average, picked up 
due to inventory buildup in Malaysia and expansion in the electronics industry in the 
Philippines and Thailand.   
 
Across the region, increased food and energy prices continued to push consumer price 
inflation higher, prompting governments to adopt new measures to control inflation.  On 
Fe
bruary 1, the Indonesian government introduced progressive export taxes on palm oil, 
and subsidies for prices of soybeans, in addition to the already in-effect subsidies on fuel 
a
nd rice prices.  T he P
hilippines‟ Central Bank lowered interest rates ¼-percentage point 
in January.  In other countries, policy rates were kept on hold to contain inflationary 
pressures, despite increasing interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the U.S. policy rate.  On 
February 13, Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi announced the dissolution of parliament. 
The new elections were held on March 8.  The ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition 
won 63 percent of parliamentary seats, down from its previous 90 percent, and falling 
short of a two-thirds majority.  Abdullah Badawi will continue as Prime Minister. 
Although BN maintained a simple majority, the results are interpreted by political 
analysts as a setback for BN and a vot e against the government‟s recent handling of such 
sensitive issues as racial tension and inflation.  On March 3, Thailand‟s  central bank 
eliminated capital control measures instituted in 2006 during the military junta rule.

Real GDP for Mexico increased 3 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, more than most 
analysts had anticipated.  The increase was largely driven by the services sector, while 
manufacturing continued to show signs of moderation.  The Mexican government met its 
fiscal target of a balanced budget in 2007, as rising oil and non-oil revenues supported an 
increase in government expenditures.  Headline inflation ticked down to 3.7 percent in 
January, below the upper limit of the central bank‟
s target range .  However, core inflation 
readings continue to be elevated, with large increases in the housing sector price index. 
 
 
 
In Brazil , real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter.  January industrial 
pr
oduction partially rebounded from its dip in December, bringing twelve-month growth 
to 7¾ percent.  Strong domestic demand also continued to fuel rapid import growth, 
leading to a further narrowing of the trade surplus in January.  Twelve-month inflation 
through January remained high at 5 percent, boosted by food prices.  With capacity 
utili
zation rates still high and inflationary pressures from food and energy prices still a 
concern, at its March 6 monetary policy meeting the central bank unanimously voted to 
keep the target for the overnight interest rate, the Selic rate, at 11¼ percent.  The target 
has re
mained at that level since last September.

External and domestic factors continue to support growth in Argentina .  The increase in 
agricultural commodity prices has provided strong stimulus to agricultural production and 
exports.  The overall trade surplus increased further in the fourth quarter.  Domestic 
demand remains strong, primarily consumption and residential investment.  Consumer 
price inflation moderated to a still-elevated rate of 8.2 percent in January.  The figure 
reported by the national statistical office, though, was once again below market 
expectations.  Allegations that the authorities understate the rate of inflation continue.

Real GDP for Venezuela  increased 16 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.  Quarterly 
growth estimates should be viewed with great caution, however, and growth slowed last 
year on a four-quarter basis to about 8½ percent.  Petroleum output was down by over 
4 percent, reflecting managerial problems at the government-owned PDVSA and the 
hostil
e environment for foreign investors.  In early February, a UK court issued an 
injunction that freezes up to $12 billion in PDVSA assets held abroad until the 
Venezuelan government reaches a settlement with Exxon Mobil for last y
ear‟s 
government takeovers of energy projects.  Chavez reacted to the move by halting 
shipments to Exxon Mobil.  Inflation reached 24 percent in January on a twelve-month 
basis. 
 
Despite the high price of oil, the current account surplus narrowed $7.1 billion in 2007, as 
im
port growth was very strong, fueled by loose macro policies and the below-market 
official exchange rate.

In Turkey, third-quarter real GDP contracted due to significant cuts in government 
spending and a drop in exports.  Incoming data suggest that growth rebounded in the 
fourth quarter.  Average industrial production for the fourth quarter was up 3.7 percent. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation has continued to be hoisted by food and energy 
prices in recent months, reaching 9.1 percent in February, significantly higher than the 
upper limit of the central bank‟s  year -end target of 4 percent +/- 2 percentage points.  
Nonetheless, having loosened policy for six consecutive months, in February, the 
Monetary Policy Committee further cut the borrowing and lending rates 25 basis points 
to 15¼ percent and to 19¼ percent, respectively.  The Monetary Policy Committee 
indicated that the lagged effects of previous monetary tightening coupled with weak 
aggregate demand will continue to support disinflation in the medium term.
