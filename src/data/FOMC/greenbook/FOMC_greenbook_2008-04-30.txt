Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
The incoming data continue to suggest that the economy has stalled so far this year.  
Labor market conditions have deteriorated further, housing activity remains on a steady 
descent, and nonresidential co nstruction now appears to have turned down as well.  
Consumer spending has been anemic, with se ntiment tumbling further.  Investment in 
business equipment looks to have flattene d out in the first quarter.  And although 
manufacturing activity rose in March, it has nevertheless been soft for the year to date.  
Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, but overall 
inflation remains elevated. 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor demand continued to weaken in Marc h.  Private payroll employment fell 98,000 
following similar declines in January and February.  Once again, the declines were 
widespread by industry, with the ex ception of nonbusiness services.1  The workweek 
ticked up 0.1 hour in March, to 33.8 hours,  and aggregate hours of production or 
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payr olls rose 0.2 percent.  Nevertheless, 
aggregate hours fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent for the first quarter as a whole. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  rose 0.3 percentage point in March, to 
5.1 percent.  The unemployment rate averaged  4.9 percent in the first quarter, up from 
4.8 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.5 per cent in the first half of 2007.  Job losers 
accounted for most of the increase in March, as they have over the past year.  The labor 
force participation rate stood at  66.0 percent in March and has changed little, on net, over 
the past year. 
By and large, other indicators of labor dema nd have also continued to weaken.  Initial 
claims for unemployment insurance, the level of insured unemployment, and the 
household survey’s measure of job losers une mployed less than five  weeks as a percent 
of employment have all risen further this ye ar.   Moreover, the most recent readings on 
net hiring plans from both the Manpower and National Federation of Independent 
Business (NFIB) surveys moved down, and the vacancy rate (job openings as a percent of private employment) in the Job Openings a nd Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey fell further 
in February (the latest availa ble data).  In contrast, the hiring rate in the JOLT survey was 
flat from December to February  after declining since the midd le of 2006, while the rate of  
                                                 
1 On February 26, about 3,600 UAW employees at American Axle & Manufacturing, a motor vehicle 
parts supplier for General Motors, went on strike.  Shutdowns of auto plants directly and indirectly affected 
by the strike likely account for a substantial proportion of  the 24,000 jobs lost in the motor vehicle sector in 
March; even excluding motor vehicles, however, manufacturing employment fell 24,000.

layoffs and discharges in the JOLT survey has changed little recently, on net, after rising 
last year. 
Meanwhile, perceptions of labor market ti ghtness in the Conference Board and NFIB 
surveys eroded further last month, and the fr action of workers who are working part time 
for economic reasons rose again.  Households’ expectations for labor  market conditions 
in the Reuters/University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys also continued to 
worsen in March, and the Reuters/Michigan measure slid further in the first half of April. 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) has essentially m oved sideways since August, with robust 
export demand providing some offset to th e direct and upstream effects on production 
from weak residential constr uction and soft demand for moto r vehicles.  In March, total 
IP rose 0.3 percent after a 0.7 pe rcent decline in February, refl ecting sizable swings in the 
output of utilities and manufacturing.  Factory output last month was damped by a sharp 
drop in motor vehicle and parts production, the result of the strike at American Axle.  
Outside of motor vehicles and parts, manufact uring output rose 0.4 pe rcent in March after 
falling 0.5 percent in February.  The factor y operating rate stood at 78.5 percent last 
month, a level 1.6 percentage points belo w the recent high reached in July and 
1.2 percentage points below its 1972-2007 average. 
Motor vehicle production plunged to an annual rate of 9.4 million units in March, a 
decline of 700,000 units from the previous month.  A drop in assemblies at General

2 The strike at American Axle has halted or severely reduced production at eight GM assembly plants 
and about two dozen auto parts plants in the United States; the affected assembly plants account for about 
900,000 units (annual rate) of production.    
3 In addition to the strike at American Axle, local labor disputes halted production in April at an auto 
parts plant supplying GM and at a GM assembly plant. plants, more than accounted for last month’s decline.2  Most of the affected assembly 
lines produce full-size pickups and sport-utility  vehicles, the vehicles for which demand 
has slowed considerably in recent months.  On the whole, days’ supply of light vehicles 
was at comfortable levels through the end of last quarter.  For the current quarter, the 
automakers’ announced production schedules, wh ich do not incorporat e strike-related 
plant shutdowns (even for April), call for assemblies to move up to a rate of 10.3 million 
units.  However, because demand remains soft and the labor dispute is ongoing, production this quarter may be a good bit lower than the official  industry schedules.

After slowing abruptly at the end of last
 year, civilian aircra ft production was little 
changed last quarter.  Boeing recently a nnounced a further six-month delay for its 
787 Dreamliner, pushing the expected first deliv eries back to the th ird quarter of next 
year.  This development will likely cause civili an aircraft output this year to increase at 
its slowest pace since 2004. 
Although high-tech output rose briskly in March,  it slowed in the firs t quarter as a whole 
to a pace well below the average over the 2003- 07 expansion.  The deceleration was most 
pronounced for semiconductors:  Demand for chips other than microprocessor units 
(MPU) has been especially soft, and downstream demand from cell phone manufacturers 
reportedly has been weak.  However, chip i nventories do not appear to be excessive and 
should not be an impediment to further production gains.  For computers, unit absorption data from the International Data Corpor ation suggest that pr oduction of personal 
computers declined in the first quarter, with pa rticular softness in the consumer market.  
In contrast, anecdotal reports from Intel a nd IBM suggest that U.S. demand for servers 
has been relatively robust.  Elsewhere in  high-tech, the pace of output gains for 
communications equipment slowed considerably  in the first quarter after a relatively 
strong fourth quarter. 
On balance, the available forward-looking indicators suggest that  high-tech output will 
continue to increase at a m odest pace over the next few months.  For semiconductors, 
Intel’s initial guidance for the second quarter points to a solid rise in MPU production.  In 
contrast, a contact at a major manufacturer  of data networking equipment noted that 
global orders appear to be the weakest since 2003, with widespread softness in the United

States.  In addition, according to the latest survey from the National Association for 
Business Economists (NABE), business pl ans for future spending on high-tech 
equipment deteriorated in the first quarter. 
Outside of the energy, motor vehicles and pa rts, and high-tech categories, production 
decreased at an annual rate of  1.1 percent in the first quar ter.  Among the major market 
groups, the index for construc tion supplies registered anot her big drop.  The production 
of consumer goods edged down in the first quarter, as weakness in consumer durables—
especially in appliances, furniture, and products related to home improvement—was 
mostly offset by gains in the output of nondur ables.  Production of business equipment, 
however, climbed solidly, led by increases in industrial and other equipment. 
Available near-term indicators suggest that f actory output is likely to weaken over the 
next few months.  The new orders index from  the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) 
declined to 46.5 in March and is consistent  with modest declin es in manufacturing 
output.  The new orders indexes in the various  regional surveys, on balance, strengthened 
a touch in March but, at best , suggest little change in manufacturing output.  The first 
readings on activity in April were mixed.  Ne w orders in the Empire State Manufacturing 
Survey firmed slightly, but the new orders  index from the Philadelphia Fed Business 
Outlook Survey fell to a very low level.  Fi nally, outside of a further decline in motor 
vehicle assemblies, the available weekly produc tion data, on net, contri bute little to the 
change in output this month. 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of automobiles and light trucks averaged  an annual rate of just 15.2 million units in 
the first quarter, nearly 1 million units below the pace in the previous quarter (as well as 
that for 2007 as a whole).   
.  High gasoline prices and the su stained decline in residential construction 
activity continued to erode demand for full-si ze pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, 
and sales in these segments were particularly weak last quarter.  The market share of the 
Detroit Three automakers, who rely heavily  on sales in these ca tegories, moved down 
further last quarter, to 50 percent. 
Forward-looking indicators of demand for motor vehicles suggest that  sales will recede 
further in April.  The Reuters/Michigan index of car-buying attitudes continued to 
deteriorate in the first half of April; although the availability of cas h rebates and cut-rate 
financing has increased this year, the overall level of incentives has remained modest 
relative to past sales promotions.  Through the first 20 days of April, sales at the major

4 Because the Bureau of Economic Analysis lack s timely data on many categories of services 
consumption, spending on services has been subject to no ticeable downward revisions around the start of 
downturns in economic activity—for example, from late 1981 to early 1982 and then from late 1990 to 
early 1991. Japanese automakers were below the pace in March, and our contacts at the Detroit Three 
automakers also project weak er sales in the near term. 
Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumer spending appears to have flattened out, on balance, in recent 
months.  On the basis of the latest retail sa les data, we estimate that real expenditures on 
goods other than motor vehicles were little  changed in March after having declined 
slightly, on net, over the preceding six months; spending in March appears to have been 
boosted significantly by a sizab le increase in real outlays  on gasoline, which roughly 
offset declines in a number of other categor ies.  Smoothing through th e volatility in the 
energy components, real outlays on services were reported to have held up reasonably 
well through February, but estimates for these categories are often extr apolations of past 
trends that may not reflect the actual pace of spending.4  The personal saving rate stood at 
0.3 percent in February and has remained cl ose to zero since the middle of last year. 
Consumer spending continues to be restrained by adverse fundamentals.  In particular, 
after averaging an annualized rate of about 3 percent over the first three quarters of 2007, 
the rise in real disposable pe rsonal income has slowed to an annual rate of just 1 percent 
since then, as employment conditions have w eakened and prices for energy have risen.  
Moreover, household net worth is down:  Equity prices—though up this month—have 
dropped appreciably, on net, since the start of the year, while recent indicators point to 
further declines in house prices early this year.  And although in terest rates on credit 
cards and auto loans have edged down recently in  the wake of steep declines in Treasury 
rates, the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey suggests that le nders have continued 
to tighten standards on household loans (see appendix to the “Domestic Financial 
Developments” section). 
Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey, plunged in early 
April from already depressed levels.  Indee d, both this measure of consumer sentiment 
and the one from the Conference Board—w hich is available through March—have 
dropped precipitously since last summer.  Th ese declines reflect heightened concerns 
about the economy that can only partially be explained by the usual influences on 
sentiment, including inflation, the stock mark et, and employment conditions.  The index

from the Reuters/Michigan survey now stands  a touch below the nadir reached during the 
1990-1991 recession. 
Housing  
Residential construction activity has continued to plummet.  In the single-family sector, 
housing starts were at an annual rate of  680,000 units in March, down 13 percent from 
three months earlier, while adjusted permit issuance in this sector—w hich tends to lead 
new activity by a month or so—descended at a similar rate and remained below the level 
of starts.  Cutting through the month-to-month volatility, multifamily starts came in at an 
annual rate of about 310,000 units in the first quarter, in line  with their average since 
mid-2006 but about 10 percent below the middle of the fairly narrow range of readings 
posted during the housing boom. 
Housing demand has weakened substantially since late summer, and forward-looking 
indicators—such as pending home sales, th e Mortgage Bankers A ssociation index of 
mortgage purchase applications, and th e Reuters/Michigan measure of homebuying 
sentiment—provide little basis for expecti ng demand to firm in the coming months.  
Existing home sales fell 2¾ percent in Ma rch, down 18 percent from their reading 
12 months earlier.  As for new homes, availabl e data from the Census Bureau show that 
the number of new-home sales agreements dr opped to an annual rate of 590,000 units in 
February, a decrease of 30 percent from their ye ar-earlier level.  As a result, even though 
production cuts by homebuilders helped reduce the level of inventories about 13 percent 
over the year ending in February, the months’ supply of new homes for sale continued to 
move higher.   
 
 
. 
Much of the most recent weakening in housing demand can be attributed to the challenging mortgage lending environment.  The supply of credit is pa rticularly tight for 
loans that cannot be purchased by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  Nonprime mortgages (which include the subprime and a lt-A categories) have all but disappeared 
from the market this year.  Meanwhile, rate s for prime-rate jumbo mortgages have risen 
substantially relative to conforming rates sin ce midsummer, and the share of these loans 
in total prime-rate mortgage or iginations fell from 9 percent in  July 2007 to 3½ percent in

5 The stimulus bill enacted in February temporarily increased the conforming loan limit for a given city 
to 125 percent of the median house price for the highes t-priced county in the city’s metropolitan area, up to 
a maximum of $729,750.  In early April, Fannie M ae and Freddie Mac set up facilities to purchase these 
new jumbo conforming mortgages, and they appear ready to begin purchasing these loans from lenders 
soon.  Early indications suggest that rates for these loans will be about 50 to 75 basis points above rates for conventional conforming loans.  The stimulus bill also raised the limit on Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) loans. However, the FHA's relatively strict underwriting standards will likely limit the number of 
households that will benefit from this change. February 2008 (the latest available data).5  In contrast, rates fo r fixed-rate conforming 
loans are now about ¾ percenta ge point below their midsumme r peaks and, at just under 
6 percent, are quite low by historical standard s.  But these low rates are benefiting fewer 
buyers because the GSEs have tightened thei r standards for conforming loans and added 
extra fees for borrowers with lower credit scores and less collateral. 
House prices have continued to fall.  Despite an uptick in Febr uary, the new monthly 
version of the purchase-only repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight (O FHEO) decreased at an annual rate of 4 percent over the 
three months ending in February.  The 10-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-sales 
price index—which, unlike the OFHEO index, includes houses financed by 
nonconforming loans and is more heavily con centrated in urban areas that had seen 
greater appreciation in earlie r years—fell at an annual rate  of 21 percent over the three 
months ending in January.  And the constant-quality price index for new homes fell at an annual rate of 6 percent in the fourth quarter.  Although these lower prices may 
eventually help bolster housing demand, the most recent readings from the Reuters/Michigan house-price survey indicate  that a growing percentage of respondents 
expect prices to fall further in the coming year, a consideration that may make buyers 
reluctant to purchase homes until pr ices show signs of stabilizing. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software has decelerated in recent months after having 
posted a tepid increase in the fourth quarte r of 2007.  Shipments and orders of nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft were down in January and February, and investment more broadly remains under downward pressu re from slowing aggregate demand and 
tightening credit conditions.  On the whole, national and re gional indicators of business 
conditions remain downbeat.  In addition, corporate bond yields, though down in recent 
weeks, remain above levels prevailing at th e end of last year—esp ecially for high-yield 
issues—and the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows that banks continue to tighten both price and nonprice standards on business loans.

II-23 
Some of the softness in equipment spending in early 2008 has been in outlays on light 
motor vehicles, which have been pulled down by cutbacks of deliveries to daily rental 
companies.  In addition, sales of medium and heavy trucks (classes 4 through 8), which 
fell sharply over the course of 2007, remained de pressed in the first qua rter, and a drop in 
orders in recent months point s to continued near-term weakne ss in sales.  In contrast, 
shipments of complete aircraft to domestic purchasers appear to have picked up in early 
2008 after a steep decline in  the second half of 2007. 
Real spending on high-tech equipment and softwa re has also not exhi bited much vigor of 
late.  As noted above, industrial producti on of computers—the ma jor input into the 
estimate of computer spending in the national income and product accounts (NIPA)—posted a relatively moderate gain in the first quarter, and real M3 shipments of computers 
declined, on net, in January and Februar y.  Orders and shipments of communications 
equipment also fell substantially, on net, over the first two months of 2008.  Moreover, as 
mentioned above, the NABE survey conducte d in the first quar ter suggests that 
businesses have scaled back their plans for spending on high-tech equipment. 
Real spending on equipment other than high-te ch and transportation remained subdued in 
early 2008 after having slackened somewhat in late 2007.  Still, the spending data 
through February for this broad category are not as soft as would be implied by the 
downbeat readings on business sentiment of late .  To be sure, both orders and shipments 
fell a good bit in February, but some of this  decline may have reflected a hiccup in 
foreign demand for these capital goods rath er than a further slowing of domestic 
spending.  Indeed, the February internationa l trade data showed a drop in exports along 
with a jump in imports. 
Nonresidential Construction  
The recent monthly construction data suggest  that spending on nonresidential buildings  
crested around the turn of the year after posting robust gains in 2006 and 2007.  
Moreover, demand for existing commercial prop erties has fallen off substantially from 
record levels last year, and prices appear  to be decelerating.  Although vacancy rates 
point to fairly balanced supply and demand conditions in the markets for office and 
industrial space, vacancy rates for retail space have been trending up for some time now, 
and anecdotal reports suggest that the supply of new projects in the pipeline may outpace demand in this sector.  The three-month average of the architectural billings diffusion index—which is fairly well correlated w ith construction at a horizon of about two 
quarters—moved down sharply in March, poi nting to considerable declines in 
nonresidential construction in the second half of the year.

II-25 
The apparent deceleration in nonr esidential constructi on is likely due, at least in part, to 
the difficult financing environment.  Issuan ce of commercial mortgage-backed securities 
has slowed to a trickle in recent months, and the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey indicated that about 80 percent of ba nks tightened lending standards in the first 
quarter—about the same as January’s record  reading for this index.  Anecdotes from 
general contractors also point  to tighter credit conditions, especially for speculative 
projects. 
Finally, data on drilling rigs in  operation and on footage of ne w wells drilled suggest that 
real expenditures on drilling and mi ning structures in the early part  of this year likely rose 
at a pace similar to the 6¾ percent annual rate realized in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventory investme nt excluding motor vehicles di pped to an annual rate of 
just $4 billion in the fourth quarter, but book-value data for the ma nufacturing and trade 
sector point to a modest rebound, on average, in  January and February.  Still, outside of 
categories tied to housing c onstruction—namely, construction supplies and, to a lesser 
extent, materials—we continue to see little evidence that firms are burdened with excess 
stocks.  Although the ratio of book-value invent ories to sales (excluding motor vehicles) 
has inched up since the end of 2007, data fr om the staff’s flow-of-goods system suggest 
that months’ supply moved down in the first quarter after spurting in December.  In 
addition, businesses surveyed by the ISM in March continued to report that, on the 
whole, their customers were reasonably satisfied with thei r level of stocks. 
Federal Government Sector  
Largely because of weakness in receipts, th e federal budget defic it has continued to 
widen.  Adjusted for payment-timing shifts a nd financial transacti ons, the unified budget 
deficit was $215 billion during the three months ending in March, up from an adjusted deficit of $169 billion recorded during the same period last year. 
In total, tax receipts in the January to March period were about 1½ percent below their 
year-earlier level.  Individua l income and payroll taxes posted a meager 1¼ percent gain, 
while corporate tax receipts fell substan tially.  According to daily Treasury data, 
corporate receipts in April, which are mo stly the first quarterly estimates on 2008 
liabilities, appear to be about the same as collections last April.  Nonwithheld individual 
income tax payments—which are largely ne t payments on 2007 liabili ties—have come in 
slightly below the tax collections of this time last April.  However, because final

payments will continue to be recorded through early May, it is sti ll too soon to make a 
reliable comparison with last y ear’s individual tax filing season. 
Outlays in the January to March period, adjust ed for payment-timing shifts and financial 
transactions, rose 5½ percent from the year -earlier comparable period.  Defense spending 
increased 9½ percent and net interest paymen ts rose 7 percent; major transfers and other 
outlays moved up more modestly.  Relative to the fourth quarter  of 2007, however, the 
rise in defense spending was less pronounced and suggests only a small pickup in real 
defense purchases as measured in  the NIPA in the first quarter. 
State and Local Government Sector  
Real purchases by state and local governments appear to have decelerated sharply in the 
first quarter after having posted a hefty increase in 2007.  The deceleration was 
concentrated in construction expenditures, which fell steeply in December and remained 
subdued in January and February.  Although the construction series can be quite volatile, 
some slowing in construction activity after the rapid increase in 2007 seems consistent 
with the tighter fiscal conditions facing many states and localities.  Meanwhile, state and 
local employment rose 21,000 per month, on averag e, in the first quarter, approximately 
the same pace as in 2007. 
The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue 
indicates that state tax revenues during th e year ending in December were 4½ percent 
above their year-earlier level, about the same as for the year ending in September.  The 
recent increases in state revenues are substant ially below those recorded a few years ago, 
and press reports suggest that  at least a few states, incl uding California and Florida, 
expect to face significant budgetary stress in th e 2009 fiscal year (which begins on July 1 
in most states) as revenue growth is projected to slow further.  At the local level, growth 
in property tax revenue ticked down in the f ourth quarter of 2007 but remained relatively 
strong, as the downturn in housing prices ha s not yet translated into a significant 
slowdown in these revenues. 
Prices 
Boosted by large increases in food and energy prices, headline consumer prices continued 
to increase faster than core consumer prices over the first three m onths of 2008 but not as 
quickly as they did late last year.  On the basis of information from the consumer price 
index and other sources, we estimate that  overall prices for personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) increased 0.3 percent in  March, a rise that  brought the 12-month 
change through March to 3.2 percent, up from  2.5 percent for the preceding 12 months.

6 Some of the drop in inventories likely also reflects a runoff of gasoline stocks before the June 1 
switch to summer blends. We estimate that core PCE prices increas ed 0.2 percent in Marc h after rising just 
0.1 percent in February.  Smoothing through the volatility in the recent data, the three-
month change in core PCE prices has reced ed some since November and stood at an 
annual rate of 2.0 percent in March.  This step-down largely reflect s a swing in medical 
services prices, which have been nearly flat  recently after an earl ier period of large 
increases.  Over the 12 months ending in Ma rch, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, 
0.2 percentage point less than  over the preceding 12 months. 
PCE energy prices changed little, on average,  during January and February; we estimate 
that they moved up 2 percent in March a nd stood 16½ percent above  their year-earlier 
level.  Current survey data suggest that reta il gasoline prices have increased moderately 
in April.  Since the increase has fallen shor t of the surge in crude  oil prices, refiners’ 
margins have been squeezed.  In respons e, they have cut back on production, and 
inventories have fallen back toward seasonal norms.6  With margins tight, producers have 
very little cushion to absorb further increases in the price of crude oil. 
After advancing quickly in Ja nuary and February, food prices  rose at a more moderate 
pace in March.  Nevertheless, the 12-month change through March stood at 4¼ percent, 
about 1 percentage point higher than the in crease over the preceding 12 months.  Spot 
prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans have b een volatile recently after rising markedly 
over the past year.  Since the March Gree nbook, wheat prices have decreased 25 percent 
after surging at the beginning of the year, while corn prices have continued to climb higher.  These relative movements may reflect, in part, the release of  the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture’s annual Prospective Plantings  report, which showed that farmers are 
likely to plant less corn and more soybeans a nd wheat this year than they did in 2007. 
Measures of near-term inflation expectations  have risen sharply:   According to the 
Reuters/Michigan survey, median expectati ons for year-ahead inflation moved up from 
3.4 percent in December to 4.8 percent in ea rly April, the highest reading since 1990.  
Longer-term expectations as measured by th e Reuters/Michigan measure of median 
inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years edged back up in April to 3.1 percent; the April reading reversed the downtick ove r the preceding few months and brought the 
series close to the top of the narrow range s een over the past few years.  In contrast, 
measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury inflation- protected securities 
have moved down since the March Greenbook—t he five-year measure has edged down 
about 0.1 percentage point and the five-year,  five-year-ahead measure has decreased

   about 0.4 percentage point.  Even so, the medi an expectation over the next 5 to 10 years, 
at 2.8 percent, is still about 0.1 percentage po int above its level at the end of December, 
whereas the five-year measure now stands at 2.1 percent, a bit below its level at the end 
of the year. 
The producer price index for core intermed iate materials rose 1.1 percent in March, 
bringing the three-month change to an annual rate of 11 percent.  Over the past few 
months, price increases have been concentr ated in metals and in energy-intensive 
categories (such as chemicals, plastics, and paints).  The string of recent advances pushed 
the 12-month change in March to 5½ percent, more than 2 percentage points higher than 
over the preceding 12 months. 
 
Commodity price changes have been mixed r ecently, but prices remain well above levels 
of a year ago.  Since the March Greenbook, metals  prices have varied; notable within the 
metals categories is the price of steel scrap, which jumped 38 percent,  largely because of 
strong foreign demand and the strike-induced  shutdowns of several General Motors 
plants, a significant supplier of steel scrap.  On balance, the Journal of Commerce ’s index 
of industrial materials has increased 4¼ percent since the March Greenbook; the 
Commodity Research Bureau’s spot index of industrial materials, which excludes energy 
products, is up 2½ percent. 
Labor Costs 
Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent in March.  Over the past 12 months, this 
measure has risen 3½ percent, more than ½ percentage point below the rise over the 
preceding 12 months.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Conditions in financial markets improved somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period, as investors apparently  became less concerned about a severe deepening of the 
ongoing financial difficulties.  The improved sentiment was supported by the Federal Reserve’s continued efforts to bolster market liquidity and by news about large financial 
institutions that was seen as reducing the odds  of possible failures.  Investors marked up 
the expected path of policy notably, and the onset of a gradual policy tightening is now 
anticipated late this year.  Treasury yields rose with policy expectations and also on some reduction in the demand for safe-haven assets ; the largest increase was concentrated at 
the front end of the yield curve.  Over th e intermeeting period, inflation compensation 
over the next five years remained below the average level between the January and March FOMC meetings.  The five-year-for ward measure of inflation compensation 
moved lower.  Equity prices posted sizab le gains over the intermeeting period, and 
corporate credit spreads decreased, particularly  for speculative-grade and financial firms.  
Nevertheless, indicators of risk  and volatility remain elevated across most asset classes.  
With further losses on securities and househol d loans, pressures on bank balance sheets 
continued to mount, contribut ing to intensified strains in some short-term funding 
markets and to additional tightening of bank lending standards across all types of loans. 
 
 Money Market Functioning 
Over the intermeeting period, strains increased further in some short-term funding 
markets.  Amid heightened bank funding pressures, spreads of Libor rates over comparable-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rates widened significantly.  Primary 
credit borrowing picked up noticeably afte r March 16, when the spread between the 
primary credit rate and the target federal f unds rate was lowered to 25 basis points.  
Outsized demand for bank funding pushed stop-ou t rates on the ninth and tenth auctions 
conducted through the Term Auction Facility up to or above term Libor rates and 
considerably above the primary credit ra te.  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility—
established on March 16 to pr ovide overnight funding to prim ary dealers in exchange for 
a range of collateral includi ng investment-grade securities—drew substantial initial 
demand, although the amount outstanding decl ined somewhat over the period.   
In commercial paper markets, spreads of rates on 30-day AA-rated financial paper over 
rates on AA-rated nonfinancial paper shot up to record levels, while spreads on both 
A2/P2 nonfinancial paper and asset-backed co mmercial paper were vol atile and elevated.  
Even among programs that have been paying el evated spreads, low short-term interest 
rates have kept yields toward the bottom of their range of the past few years.

III-3 
Early in the intermeeting period, strong demand for safe-haven assets was reflected in 
historically low rates for general collateral (GC) Treasury repo a nd Treasury bills, and 
both markets were under considerable strain.  Conditions in those markets have improved 
significantly, evidently in response to Fede ral Reserve actions that increased the 
availability of Treasury securi ties.  In four separate auc tions conducted through the Term 
Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), the Federa l Reserve offered a total of $150 billion of 
Treasury securities in exchange for less-liquid assets.  Treasu ry GC rates moved back in 
line with other short-term interest rates,  and their spreads below mortgage-backed 
security (MBS) repo rates decreased.  Yields  on Treasury bills also  recovered, and their 
spreads below comparable-maturity OIS rates narrowed substantially.  Nevertheless, haircuts on non-Treasury collateral remain elev ated and in some cases have increased a 
little in recent weeks.  
 Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The expected path for the federal funds rate moved up significantly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  The 75 basis points of policy easing at the March FOMC meeting 
was somewhat less than investors had expecte d, and market participants reportedly also 
revised up their expectations on the basis of the FOMC stat ement, including the news of 
two dissenting votes; overall, the statement conveyed more c oncern about inflation than 
investors had anticipated.  The Chairman’s testimony on April 2 was associated with a 
further small upward shift in the expected policy path.  Incoming economic data were 
mixed but on net contributed to the rise in  policy expectations, as did a number of 
announcements by large financial institutions that investors interpreted as pointing 
toward more-favorable prospects for such firms.   
Options on federal funds futures indicate that  market participants now see about a  
70 percent probability of a 25 basis point cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting, about 
25 percent odds of no policy ch ange, and low odds of a 50 basis point cut.  Investors 
expect the funds rate to bottom out at about 2 percent this summer, and they anticipate 
that the target will rise gr adually in 2009 and 2010.  The April survey of primary dealers, 
on the other hand, suggests that economists expect  the target rate to  bottom out at about 
1½ percent in the first part of 2009.  Ov er the intermeeting period, the implied 
distribution of the federal f unds rate six months ahead became significantly less skewed 
to the downside, and implied uncertainty about the near-term po licy path decreased 
considerably.

Yields on Treasury coupon securities rose sharply over the intermeeting period, with 
2-year and 10-year yields climbing about 80 and 40 basis points, respectively, increases 
that were consistent with both the higher e xpected path for policy and an easing of safe-
haven demand.  At the 5-year horizon, TIPS-based inflation compensation was 
particularly volatile in the days around the March FOMC meeting, as investors sought the 
comparative liquidity of nominal Treasury s ecurities.  Since the March meeting, 5-year 
inflation compensation increased about 25 ba sis points, but smoot hing through the recent 
volatility, 5-year inflation compensation is sti ll in the lower portion of its range of the 
past several months.  Over the intermeeting period, inflation compensation 5 to 10 years 
ahead declined 30 basis points, returning to about the middle of its recent range. 
 
 
 Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes increased about 8 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
more than reversing the sharp decline reco rded between the January and March FOMC 
meetings.  Much of the rise came in  response to earnings and recapitalization 
announcements from financial institutions, wh ich investors read as trimming the odds of 
severe difficulties among major financial firm s.  Gains were widespread across sectors, 
but securities brokers outperformed the broader market.  The spread between the 
12-month-forward trend earnings-t o-price ratio for all firms in the S&P 500 and a real 
long-term Treasury yield—a rough gauge of th e equity risk premium—remained at the 
upper end of its range over the past two decades.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index came down over the intermeeting period but continued to be elevated.    
Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds rose a b it less than those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities, while those on speculative- grade bonds fell.  As a result, spreads on 
BBB-rated bonds decreased 15 basis points from their recent multiyear highs, and 
spreads on speculative-grade bonds dropped 100 basis points.  For speculative-grade 
bonds, near-term forward spreads fell much mo re than far-term forward spreads, an 
indication of an easing of concerns about th e outlook for corporate credit quality over the 
next few years.  Measures of secondary-m arket functioning for corporate bonds also 
improved notably over the intermeeting pe riod.  Although issuance remained weak, 
secondary-market prices of leveraged syndicated loans continued to rebound from their February lows, and bid-asked spreads narrowed somewhat.

have fallen 14 percent relative to year-earlier  levels.  The decline resulted from a large 
drop in financial sector earnings , reflecting additional write-dow ns of troubled assets.  In 
contrast, earnings per share for nonfinancial  firms are estimated to have increased  
8 percent over the past year.  Estimated ear nings for financial firms over the year ahead 
were revised down noticeably in March, but the corresponding estimates for nonfinancial 
firms were little changed. 
 
 
 
 The data indicate that nonfinancial corporations ended 2007 with solid balance sheets. 
The aggregate ratio of liquid a ssets to total assets remained  high by historical standards. 
and the aggregate leverage ratio only edged up from a low level.  In February, there were 
few ratings changes for corporat e bonds, and in March the rea lized six-month default rate 
on corporate bonds stayed close to zero.  Ho wever, the KMV forecast of the aggregate 
year-ahead default rate, climbed to its highest level in several years. 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in March and the first half of 
April.  The vast majority of issuance  was by investment-grade firms, although 
speculative-grade issuance, which had been lo w early in the year, picked up a bit.  
Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding edged down in March but moved back up in 
April.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) lo ans from banks jumped in March, as some 
borrowers reportedly tapped existing low-cost bank lines of credit, but outstandings were 
about flat in early April.  On balance, net debt financ ing through commercial paper, 
bonds, and bank C&I loans was solid through mid-April, albeit well below the pace over 
the second half of last year.   
Retirements from completed cash-financed merg ers and acquisitions were less than half 
their level in the fourth qu arter, and only one new deal valued above $5 billion was 
announced.  Retirements resulting from share re purchases also cooled in the first quarter, 
as profit growth slowed and firms reportedly sought to preserve cash positions.  Gross 
public equity issuance in March and the firs t three weeks of April was dominated by a 
single large initial pub lic offering and was otherwise sluggish in an environment of 
generally low valuations and volatile equity prices.   
Commercial Real Estate  
Sales of existing commercial properties were steady in February and March at a level far 
below the peak in 2007, and indications are th at commercial real estate prices have 
flattened out.  Spreads on credit default swap (CDS) indexes for commercial mortgage-

backed securities (CMBS) fell substantially, like those on most other debt securities.  
Even so, CMBS CDS spreads are still quite high by historical standards, and the cash 
CMBS market remained essentially dorman t over the intermeeting period.  Delinquency 
rates on CMBS and commercial bank loans b acked by existing propert ies have remained 
relatively low, while those on loans for residential and commercial construction projects climbed further in the fourth quarter.  In th e April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a 
large majority of banks reported tightening lending standards on co mmercial real estate 
loans over the past three months. 
 
 
 
 Household Finance  
Incoming data suggested a further deterioration in residential loan performance.  Data for 
February continued to show nonprime loans performing the worst, but the delinquency 
rates on other types of mortgages have risen. 
After having tightened notabl y in March, conditions in the conforming-mortgage market 
recovered somewhat in recent weeks.  Spread s between primary-market interest rates on 
conforming mortgages and rates on 10-year Treasury securities decreased over the 
intermeeting period.  Option-adjusted spreads on agency MBS also de clined on net over 
the period, amid significant volatility.  A lthough primary-market and secondary-market 
spreads remained high by historical standard s, issuance of agency MBS remained very 
strong in the first two months of 2008, sugge sting ample supply of credit for conforming 
mortgages.  In contrast, almost no non-agency  MBS were issued in January or February, 
indicating that the market for nonconformi ng products remained exceptionally tight. 
Indicators of the availability of nonmortgage consumer credit have been mixed.  Growth 
of consumer credit has slowed in recent months, particularly for nonrevolving loans.  
Following rising delinquency rates on credit-car d and auto loans early in the year, lenders 
reportedly continued to tighten standards and curb credit limits through April.  
Nonetheless, interest rates on consumer loan s decreased in recent weeks.  Issuance of 
most types of consumer asset-backed securiti es picked up in March, but issuance for auto 
loans remained quite light.  Amid continued difficulties in the secondary market, lenders 
representing more than 10 percent of government-guaranteed  student loan originations 
announced that they would not originate new loans in the fall of 2008, and originators of 
private-credit (non-government -guaranteed) loans raised interest rates and tightened 
credit standards.

Long-term mutual funds registered small in flows in March, as investors shifted the 
composition of their portfolios from equity funds to bonds funds.  Money market mutual 
funds continued to attract heavy inflows last month, but at a slower pace than earlier in 
the year. 
 
  
 
   Treasury Finance 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auc tioned 2- and 5-year nominal securities, 
with mixed results.  Demand at the auction fo r the 2-year security was quite strong, while 
the bid-to-cover ratio at the 5-year auction was slightly below its recent average.  Two 
inflation-indexed securities were auctioned as  well, with demand at both auctions in line 
with recent experience.  Allo tments to foreign investors in  the nominal Treasury auctions 
were roughly in line with other recent auctions. 
The greater availability of Treasury securities resulting from TSLF operations and sales 
from the System Open Market Account appe ars to have supported trading conditions in 
the Treasury coupon market, alt hough the functioning of this market is still somewhat 
strained.  Bid-asked spreads ha ve declined from their Marc h peaks but remain elevated, 
and the on-the-run premium for the 10-year no te remains at a five-year high.  Trading 
volumes in Treasuries have been ab out average in recent weeks.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds rebounded strongly in March and remained 
robust in the first half of April, reflecting, in part, the refina ncing of auction-rate security 
issues, for which the market remains impaired.  Short-term issuance was moderate, in line 
with typical seasonal patterns. 
The underlying credit quality of municipal bonds has rema ined strong; indeed, the 
number of ratings upgrades outpaced the num ber of downgrades in March and April.  
Yields on long-term municipal bonds declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  The 
yield ratio to comparable-maturity Treasuries retraced much of the spike in late February 
and early March. 
Money and Bank Credit  
M2 expanded at an annual rate  of 12½ percent in March, only a little below its torrid pace 
in February.  Retail money funds and liquid de posits accounted for the rapid growth last 
month.   In contrast, small time deposits contra cted in March, the firs t decline since 2004,

 Results from the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (s ee appendix to this section) 
indicate that commercial banks continued to  tighten their credit standards on all major 
loan categories over the past th ree months.  Indeed, the net fractions of banks tightening 
lending standards reached or surpassed historic al highs for all loan categories in the 
survey.  Notwithstanding this reported tight ening, commercial bank cr edit expanded at an 
annual rate of 13 percent in March, an in crease supported by growth in business and 
residential real estate lending.  Lending to businesses through C&I and commercial real 
estate loans jumped in March, particularly at large institutions.  Part of the recent strength 
in C&I lending was reportedly due to increa sed utilization of exis ting credit lines, the 
pricing of which does not fully re flect current lending practices. 
In March, outstanding residential mortgages at  banks rose at a vigorous annual rate of  
14 percent, in part because of a sluggish pace of securitization.  Growth of home equity 
lines of credit (HELOCs) was bris k last month, but commercial banks have started to take 
actions to limit their exposure to these loans:  According to the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey, a significant fraction of ba nks reported that they had tightened their 
credit standards for approving new applica tions for HELOCs, and a notable fraction 
reported that they had also firmed lending term s on existing home equity lines, mainly in 
response to declines in property values. 
Write-downs of mortgage-related assets a nd leveraged syndicated loans contributed 
importantly to a drop in commercial bank pr ofitability in the first quarter.  Banking 
institutions also increased lo ss provisions substantially.  In  addition to housing-related 
problems, banking organizations cited increas ed delinquency rates on consumer loans, 
and a few indicated that cracks had begun to appear in the credit quality of their small 
business loan portfolios.

1 Banks received the survey in early April, and their responses were due on April 17.  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey on Bank Lending Practices 
 
 
 
 
 
 The April 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.1 Special questions in the survey queried banks about changes in terms on home 
equity lines of credit and about their student loan programs.  This appendix is based on responses 
from 56 domestic banks and 21 U.S. br anches and agencies of foreign banks. 
In the April survey, domestic and foreign institutions reported having further tightened their lending standards and terms on all loan categori es over the past three months, with the net 
fractions of banks reporting tighter lending standa rds now being at, or above, historical highs for 
all loan categories in the survey.  Compared with the January survey, the net fractions of banks that tightened lending standards increased si gnificantly for consumer and commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans.  Demand for bank loans from both businesses and households reportedly weakened further, on net, over the past three months, although by less than had been the case over the previous survey period. 
Business Lending 
Questions on C&I loans.  About 55 percent of domestic banks—up from about 30 percent in the 
January survey—reported tightening lending sta ndards on C&I loans to large and middle-market 
firms over the past three months.  A significant majority of respondents reported tightening price terms on C&I loans to these firms, and in par ticular, about 70 percent of banks—up from about 
45 percent in the January survey—indicated that they had increased spreads of loan rates over 
their cost of funds.  In addition, smaller but significant net fractions of  domestic banks reported 
tightening non-price-related terms on C&I loans to these firms over the past three months.   
Regarding C&I loans to small firms, about 50 percent of domestic respondents reported 
tightening their lending standards on such loans over the survey period, compared with about  30 percent who reported doing so in the January  survey.  About 65 percent of banks—up from 
about 40 percent in the January survey—also noted that they had increased spreads of C&I loan rates over their cost of funds for these firms.  In addition, large net fractions of domestic respondents reported tightening othe r price-related terms, and smaller fractions tightened non-
price-related terms on C&I loans to small firms. 
About 60 percent of U.S. branches and agencies of  foreign banks—a slightly smaller fraction than 
in January—noted that they had tightened lending standards on C&I loans over the past three 
months, and very large majorities also reported that they had tightened price terms on such loans:

In particular, around 80 percent of foreign banks —about the same as in the January survey—
reported increasing spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds.  Finally, large fractions of 
foreign respondents reported tightening selected  non-price-related terms over the past three 
months. 
 
 
 
 
 Substantial majorities of domestic and foreign r espondents pointed to a less favorable or more 
uncertain economic outlook and to a worsening of  industry-specific problems as reasons for 
tightening their lending standards and terms on C&I loans over the past three months.  In 
addition, significant majorities of respondents c ited their banks’ reduced tolerance for risk and 
decreased liquidity in the secondary market for these loans.  About 35 percent of domestic banks 
and 45 percent of foreign institu tions—somewhat larger fractions than in the January survey—
noted that concerns about their banks’ current or expected capital position had contributed to 
more-stringent lending policies over the past three months. 
On net, about 15 percent of large domestic banks  reported that demand for C&I loans from large 
and middle-market firms had increased over the past three months, but a similar net fraction of 
these banks reported weaker demand from small firm s.  In contrast, about 20 percent of small 
domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for C&I loans from all types of firms over the 
past three months.  Finally, about 25 percent of foreign banks, on balance, reported weaker 
demand for C&I loans over the survey period. 
The vast majority of large domestic banks th at reported stronger loan demand from large and 
middle-market firms indicated that customer bo rrowing shifted to their banks from other bank or 
nonbank sources, as these other sources became less  attractive for such borrowers.  Substantial 
majorities of domestic and foreign institutions that reportedly experienced weaker loan demand 
over the past three months pointed to a decrease in customers’ needs to finance investment in 
plant and equipment.  In addition, as reasons fo r a lower demand for C&I loans, the majority of 
domestic banks indicated that customers’ needs to finance inventories had declined, and all 
foreign respondents noted a decrease in customers’  needs for merger and acquisition financing.  
Regarding future business, about 20 percent of la rge domestic banks, on net, reported an increase 
in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers over the past three months.  In 
contrast, tiny net fractions of small domestic banks and foreig n institutions indicated that 
inquiries from potential business borrowers had declined during the survey period. Questions on commercial real estate loans.   About 80 percent of domestic banks and  
55 percent of foreign banks—fractions simila r to those in the January survey—reported 
tightening their lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  
Concerning loan demand, about 35 percent of  domestic banks and 45 percent of foreign 
institutions reported weaker demand, on net, for co mmercial real estate loans over the past three 
months.

2 A total of 53 institutions reported that they origin ated prime residential mortgages.  According to Call 
Reports, these 53 banks accounted for about 80 percent of residential real estate loans on the books of all 
commercial banks as of December 31, 2007.

Questions on residential real estate loans.  Majorities of domestic respondents reported that 
they had tightened their lending standards on pr ime, nontraditional, and subprime residential 
mortgages over the past three months.  About 60 percent of domestic respondents—a somewhat 
larger fraction than in the January survey—ind icated that they had tightened their lending 
standards on prime mortgages. 2  Of the 37 banks that originated nontraditional residential 
mortgage loans, about 75 percent—a somewhat smaller fraction than in the January survey—
reported a tightening of their lending standards on such loans over the past three months. 3 
Finally, 8 of the 10 banks that originated subprime mortgage loans—a somewhat higher proportion than in the January survey—indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on such loans.
 4   
About 25 percent of domestic respondents, on net, experienced weaker demand for prime 
residential mortgage loans over the past three months, and 30 percent indicated weaker demand 
for nontraditional mortgage loans over the same pe riod.  The net fractions of respondents that 
reportedly experienced weaker demand for these two types of loans in the current survey were significantly smaller than in the January survey .  Finally, about 65 pe rcent of domestic banks— 
a net fraction similar to that in the January su rvey—reported weaker demand for subprime loans.  
About 70 percent of domestic respondents—a somewhat higher fraction than in the January 
survey—indicated that they had tightened their lending standards for approving applications for 
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) over the past three months.  Regarding demand for these 
lines, about 20 percent of domestic banks, on ne t, reported weaker demand over the past three 
months.  
Special questions on existing HELOCs.  About 50 percent of dom estic respondents reported 
having tightened terms on existing HELOCs over th e past six months.  Nearly all respondents 
pointed to declines in the value of the collateral significantly below the appraised value for the 
purposes of the HELOCs as reasons for tightening terms on these lines.  Large majorities of respondents also cited increased defaults of materi al obligations under loan agreements, as well as 
significant changes in borrowers’ financial circ umstances, as additional reasons for tightening 
terms on the existing HELOCs.

  Questions on consumer loans.  About 30 percent of dom estic banks—up from around  
10 percent in the January survey—reported that they had tightened their lending standards on 
credit card loans over the past three months.  In addition, significant net fractions of respondents indicated that they had reduced the extent to wh ich such loans were granted to customers who did 
not meet credit-scoring thresholds, reduced cr edit limits on credit card loans, and increased 
minimum required credit scores.  On net, about 25 percent of dom estic banks—up from around 
15 percent in the January survey —expressed a diminished willingness relative to three 
months earlier to make consumer installment loans.  About 45 percent of domestic banks—up 
from around 30 percent in the January survey—reported tightening lending standards on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  Simi lar fractions of respondents indicated that they 
had widened spreads of loan rates over their banks ’ cost of funds and had reduced the extent to 
which such loans were granted to customers who did not meet credit-scoring thresholds.  
Regarding loan demand, about 20 percent of r espondents, on net, indicated that they had 
experienced weaker demand for consumer loans of all types over the previous three months, 
down notably from around 35 percent in the January survey. 
Special questions on student loan programs.   In the April survey, 29 domestic banks reported 
that they had originated student loans unde r the Federal Family Education Loan Program 
(FFELP) in the fall of 2007.  Of these, about 40 percent, on net, expected that their commitments 
to provide these loans for the fall of 2008 will d ecrease relative to those made last year.  In 
addition, about 45 percent of respondents, on net,  expected the number of schools for which they 
will provide financing under the FFELP to decline relative to 2007, and about 60 percent of respondents expected to reduce the amount of bo rrower benefits on these loans relative to those 
provided in 2007.   
Of the 20 banks that reported originating private-credit (non-FFELP) student loans in the fall of 
2007, about 15 percent, on net, expected their co mmitments to provide these loans for the fall of 
2008 to decline relative to 2007.  In addition, about 40 percent of respondents expected a decline in the number of schools for which their banks will provide financing for this fall.  Finally, large fractions of banks anticipated that, compared w ith 2007, they will increase private-credit student 
loan rate spreads over their cost of funds.  Similarly, large fractions of respondents expected to tighten credit standards on private-credit student loans for the fall of 2008.

 U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $62.3 billion in February following a 
deficit
 of $59 billion in January.  The widening of the deficit reflected a sharp upswing in 
imports that more than offse
t continued robust growth of exports. 
 
In February, the value of exports of goods and services rose 2 percent, a continuation of 
recent 
robust growth.  Goods exports were boosted by strong growth of agricultural 
goods, automobiles, and industrial supplies, particularly fuels.  Exports of capital goods 
declined for the second consecutive month, with declines spread across a wide range of 
products.  Exports of services increased about 1 percent from the previous month, with 
most of this rise a
ttributable to exports of travel services. 
The a
verage value of exports in January and February increased 17 percent (a.r.) from the 
fourth quarter.  W
ith the exception of automobiles and aircraft, all major categories of 
exports increased.  Exports of agricultural goods, industrial supplies, computers, and 
consumer goods were particularly strong.

The value of imports of goods and services rose about 3 percent in February.  Excluding 
imports of petroleum, which declined in February, imports rose a very strong 5 percent.  
The
re were increases in most of the major categories of non-oil imports, with the most 
notew
orthy increases in  natural gas, automobiles, and consumer goods.  Outside of 
petroleum, declines were registered in building materials and computers.  Imports of 
se
rvices continued to rise at a robust pace. 
 
    
 
  The
 average value of imports in January and February increased almost 15 percent (a.r.) 
fr
om the fourth quarter.  Nearly all of the increase was in petroleum products, but there 
were more modest increases in imports of capital goods, foods and some categories of 
nonfuel industrial supplies.  In contrast, imports of automobiles and consumer goods 
recorded declined.  Imports of services rose, albeit at a slower pace than in recent 
quarters. 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In March, following large increases in January and February, core 
import prices rose 1.2 percent.  This increase is the second largest one-month increase in 
c
ore prices in the 13 year history of the index.  About two-thirds of the increase was due 
to higher prices for material-intensive goods, which rose 3 percent.  Prices for nonfuel 
industrial supplies jumped 3.2 percent, largely reflecting higher prices for imported 
meta
ls and chemicals.  For imported food, prices were up 2.5 percent.  In March, prices 
for
 finished goods increased 0.3 percent.  Prices for consumer goods rose 0.5 percent, 
driven in large part by increases for furniture and pharamaceutical s. 
F
or the first quarter, core import prices rose at an annual rate of 9½ percent (on a BLS 
ba
sis).  Much of the increase reflected higher prices for material-intensive goods, which 
increased at a 22¼ percent pace.  Prices for finished goods rose at a 3¾ percent pace, 
which is a notable pick-up from the 2007 pace of 2 percent.

Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 9.1 percent in March.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $105.42 per barrel in March, up 10 
percent from its February average.  Moving into the current month, the spot price of WTI 
has continued to climb, settling at $119.38 per barrel on April 22.  The price of futures 
for delivery at the end of 2016 closed at $108.83 per barrel on April 22, up $9  since mid-
March.  The increase in oil prices over this period likely reflects incoming adverse news 
re
garding prospects for supply in the coming year, particularily downward revisions to 
pr
ojected production in Mexico and Russia, as well as robust demand growth, despite the 
moder
ation of global economic growth. 
 
 
 E
xports.  In March, core export prices rose 1.9 percent.  Much of the increase reflected 
hig
her prices for material-intensive goods.  Prices for agricultural products rose 
4.1 percent.  Within agricultural products, soybean and corn prices were the largest 
contributors to the March increase, rising 9.6 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively.  
Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies were also higher, rising 3.7 percent, 
reflecting higher prices for fuels, metals, and chemicals.  Prices for finished goods 
decelerated slightly in March, increasing only 0.2 percent.   
In the first quarter, core export prices rose at an annual rate of 15¾ percent (on a BLS 
ba
sis), as prices of material-intensive goods soared 30½ percent and prices of finished 
g
oods rose 4 percent.  The large increase in material-intensive goods reflected a 
57½ percent increase in prices for agricultural exports combined with a 22½ percent 
incr
ease in prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies.  Within finished goods, the 
c
ategory with the largest increase was capital goods excluding computers and 
semiconductors, which rose 5½ percent. 
U.S. 
Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit for the fourth quarter of 2007 was reported at $692 
billion (a.r), which is $18 billion narrower than in the third quarter (revised).  For the 
third consecutive quarter, an improvement in net investment income was the primary 
reason for the narrowing deficit.  The fourth quarter increase of $47 billion (a.r.) in net 
investment income came mainly from a fall in direct investment income payments.  A 
smaller decline in portfolio interest and dividend payments was offset by a similar 
decline in portfolio income receipts, as both reflect the downward drift in interest rates.   
The
 large increase in net investment income was partly offset by a $21 billion (a.r.) 
widening in the deficit on goods and services in the fourth quarter and an increase in net 
unilateral transfers abroad.  The trade deficit on goods widened by $30 billion, with 
IV-8 
import growth outpacing export growth, while the surplus on services expanded 
somewhat.

 U.S. International Financial Transactions 
The financial flows associated with the current account are presented in the Summary of 
U.S. International Transactions Table.  Fourth-quarter foreign official inflows (line 1) 
were quite strong, bringing the total for 2007 to nearly the level of 2006 despite weaker 
inflows in the second and third quarters.  Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities 
(line 4) were also strong in the fourth quarter, driven particularly by continued „flight -to-
quality‟ into Treasury securities (line 4a).  These net purchases of Treasuries were at their 
highest quarterly level since early 2005.  Corporate stocks and bonds also posted solid net 
purchases by foreigners, more than reversing net sales in the previous quarter.   
 
The inflows f
rom private purchases of securities were offset by an unusually large 
outflow of U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) and an outflow in the volatile banking 
category (line 3).  U.S. direct investment abroad jumped in the fourth quarter because of 
increases in equity capital investment by U.S. corporations in their foreign affiliates.  
Meanwhile, foreign direct investment in the U.S. fell back to a more normal level in the 
fourth quarter after the previous quarter‟s surge (line 7).  
IV-9 
 
 
 
 
 
 Overall, net financial inflows recorded in the fourth quarter exceeded the recorded 
current account deficit, resulting in a -$57 billion statistical discrepancy for the quarter.  
This discrepancy will be narrowed somewhat once newly-released data on derivatives 
settlements are incorporated by BEA.  These new data show a net outflow of $13 billion 
for derivatives in the fourth quarter (line 8).   
Turning to the recent monthly data, in February private foreign net purchases of U.S. 
securities (line 4) jumped dramatically to $77 billion after a very weak inflow in January. 
This puts February among the highest months for private foreign net purchases recorded 
in the past two years. The surge was primarily into the safe havens of Treasury and long-
term agency securities.  Private net purchases of Treasury securities were near the peaks 
seen in the turbulent months of August, October, and November of last year.  However, 
February‟s $26 billion record high for private net purchases of agencies is in sharp 
contrast to the monthly net sales generally recorded since last August (top-right panel of 
the chart on Private Securities Flows).  Private foreign net purchases of corporate bonds 
and equities were also positive but small.  Meanwhile, U.S. residents stayed on trend by 
making $12 billion in net purchases of foreign securities (line 5), reflecting strong 
purchases of foreign stock only partly offset by net sales of foreign bonds.  
Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1) came down from their unusual highs 
of the past three months, but remained positive at $15 billion.  Official inflows went 
primarily into long-term agency bonds, with lesser inflows into corporate bonds and 
stocks.   
 
.  In contrast, foreign official investors on net sold 
short-term Treasury bills and short-term agencies.  The prices of these securities have 
been very elevated of late because of their desirability for use as collateral for repurchase 
agreements.  Official institutions, not needing them as collateral, may be shifting out of 
these securities in response.  Overall, while official inflows in February were below trend 
for most countries, inflows from OPEC remained near the record high set in January 
(charts on Foreign Official Financial Flows).  Finally, partial and confidential data on 
custody accounts at FRBNY show very strong foreign official net purchases of both 
agency and Treasury securities in March, .

Foreign Financial Markets  
The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign 
currencies is little changed since the March Greenbook.  The dollar rose about 3 percent 
against the Canadian dollar, 2 percent against sterling, and ½ percent against the yen, but 
it depreciated 2¾ percent against euro. 
 
Liquidity in European bond markets has improved as the spread between 10-year Italian, 
Portuguese, Spanish and Greek government bond yields and 10-year German government 
bond yields have decreased 15 to 20 basis points since the March Greenbook.  Ten-year 
nominal sovereign yields rose about 35 basis points in the euro-area, 25 basis points in 
the United Kingdom, and 10 basis points in Canada and Japan, and ten-year real rates 
rose 10 and 40 basis points in the euro-area, the United Kingdom, and Japan, but were 
little changed in Canada.  In line with improvements in market sentiment, major headline 
equity indexes in Europe, Japan, and the United Kingdom ended the period up 2 to 
6 percent on net.  Market analysts were focused over the period on the releases of 
better-than-expected earnings reports by Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, and 
efforts by banks to recapitalize.  In particular, on April 1, UBS announced that it would 
seek a new $15.1 billion rights issue, which would be fully underwritten by a group of 
investment banks.  
 
Despite improvements in market sentiment, the passing of quarter end, and several steps 
taken by foreign central banks to help funding markets, there are still heightened liquidity 
pressures in long term funding. LIBOR-OIS spreads widened in sterling and in euro.  The 
Bank of England lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points and conducted two 3-month 
repo auctions.  On April 21 the Bank of England unveiled a plan to swap securities 
backed by mortgages for government bonds for a period of one to three years as the U.K. 
mortgage market showed increasing signs of distress.  The ECB and SNB drew upon 
their swap lines with the Fed to auction $15 billion and $6 billion, respectively, in 28-day 
funds in conjunction with the March 25 and April 22 TAF auctions, and the ECB 
auctioned another $15 billion of 28-day funds in conjunction with the April 7 TAF.  On 
March 21 the ECB announced the introduction of a new long-term refinancing operation 
(LTRO) with a 6-month maturity.  Demand at the first LTRO auction on April 2 was 
high, indicating continued strong demand for term euro funding.  The Bank of Canada 
lowered its policy rate 50 basis points to 3 percent as expected. 
 
Several German landesbanks announced write downs since the March Greenbook, 
including the second largest landesbank, Bayern LB, which reported a €4.3 billion ($6.7 
IV-14 
billion) write down through the end of March, and WestLB, which reported a write down 
of
 €2 billion ($3.1 b illion).  A news report released in early April, citing internal 
doc
uments from the German bank regulator, BaFin, suggested that the regulator‟s 
baseline estimate for German bank losses, most of which are expected to be among the 
lande
sbanks, will total around €43 billion.   Credit Suisse ($2.9 billion), the Bank of China 
($1.3 billion), UBS ($19 billion), Deutsche Bank ($3.9 billion), KfW ($2.8 billion), and 
Mizuho ($5.6 billion) all reported write downs or loss provisions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The
 exchange value of the dollar against its other important trading partners has fallen 
1¼ percent since the March Greenbook, as the dollar has depreciated against most Asian 
a
nd Latin American currencies.  The dollar depreciated 1¾ against the renminbi on net as 
newspaper articles reported that China would use yuan appreciation as one of its major 
weapons to fight mounting inflation and the PBoC raised reserve requirements by 50 
basis points on March 18 and another 50 basis points on April 16.  The Shanghai 
Composite Index dropped 19 percent, continuing its slide since January 2008. The 
Mexican and Brazilian stock markets rose 9 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The 
S
outh Korea stock market rose 8½ percent.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Data released since the time of the March Greenbook point on balance to continued  
softening of growth in the advanced foreign economies.   In Japan, the Tankan survey 
continues to suggest subdued investment growth.  Euro-area retail sales have been flat so 
far this year, and sentiment and other survey indicators have generally declined further.  
Credit standards remained tight in Europe in the first quarter, and housing markets in a 
number of economies, such as Spain, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, continued to 
weaken.  Nevertheless, some upside surprises have materialized.  Industrial production in 
the euro area and retail sales in both the United Kingdom and Canada moved up at a solid 
pace early in the year.  Both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada continued to 
ease in response to ongoing concerns about the disruptions in financial markets and their 
effects on economic activity. 
 
 
 Inflation has continued to move up in most of these economies largely due to the past rise 
in energy and food prices.  The twelve-month rate of inflation moved up over the past 
two months in Europe, rising to 3.6 percent in the euro area and 2.5 percent in the United 
Kingdom in March.  Japanese inflation rose to 1 percent in February.  In contrast, 
inflation continued to drop in Canada, reaching 1.4 percent in March. 
In Japan , the March Tankan survey indicated that business confidence among large 
manufacturers fell significantly since the previous survey in December amidst higher oil 
prices, a much stronger yen, concerns about a slowdown of the U.S. economy, and 
turmoil in financial markets.  The decline in business confidence at small- and medium-
sized firms also accelerated, as high energy prices and low pricing power continued to 
lower firms‟ prof itability.  All companies lowered their investment plans for FY2007 and 
are projecting cuts in capital expenditures in FY2008.  
Indicators of production for the first quarter have been weak on balance as well.  
Shipments and machinery orders were down in the first two months of the year, and 
inventories rose slightly.  Industrial production edged up 0.1 percent on average in 
January and February relative to the fourth quarter.  Real merchandise exports rose 
3.3 percent in the first quarter, while real imports were about unchanged.  The solid 
growth in exports so far this year reflects robust demand from Asia and the euro area, 
while exports to the United States continued to decline. 
IV-21 
 
 
 
IV-22 
 
IV-23 
Although the labor market remains relatively strong overall, there are some signs that 
employment is weakening.  The unemployment rate inched up to 3.9 percent in February,  
and the job offers- to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings 
relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) fell to 0.97, its lowest level in 
two years.  On the other hand, total cash earnings (which include bonuses) rose for a 
second consecutive month in February, halting more than a year of declines. 
 
 
 
 The nationwide core consumer price index (excluding fresh food only) rose 1 percent in 
February from a year earlier.  The rise in the index was attributable to an increase in oil 
prices, as consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy fell 0.1 percent.  The core 
CPI for Tokyo rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier in March. 
On March 19, Governor Fukui stepped down as the head of the Bank of Japan upon the 
expiration of his term.   Deputy Governor Shirakawa was recently confirmed as the new 
Governor.  At its April meeting, the Bank of Japan unanimously voted to leave its target 
for the overnight call rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, amid concerns about the economic 
outlook and the health of financial markets.  
In the euro area , recent indicators generally point to continuing slowing in economic 
activity.  The slowdown appears to be particularly marked in consumer confidence and 
spending, as suggested by the 0.5 percent decline in the volume of retail sales in 
February.  Purchasing managers‟ indexes  (PMI) for both manufacturing and services 
eased a bit in March to levels consistent with subdued growth, and the flash estimate of 
the manufacturing PMI in April slipped further.  The European Commission survey of 
euro-area economic sentiment fell in March for the tenth consecutive month, with 
declines in confidence widespread across the consumer, industrial, and construction 
sectors.  However, Germany‟s IFO business climate index unexpectedly edged up in 
March, as firms took a slightly less gloomy view of current conditions. 
Growth in the euro-area manufacturing sector has slowed, but less sharply than in 
services, and the most recent manufacturing data have shown some resilience.  Euro -area 
industrial production (excluding construction) rose during the first two months of the 
year, and new manufacturing orders for capital goods have remained solid.  In February, 
the euro-area unemployment rate stayed at 7.1 percent —the record low set the previous 
month —as a further tightening of the labor market in Germany offset a rise in joblessness 
in Spain and Ireland.  The unemployment rate has fallen about one percentage point since 
the second half of 2006.  
IV-24 
 
 
IV-25 
Within the euro area, relatively favorable news about the German and French economies 
increasing ly contrasts with unfavorable news about the Italian and Spanish economies.  
That dichotomy can be seen in PMIs, sentiment surveys, and data on credit growth, 
spending and external trade.  Italian firms are facing pressures from the stronger euro and 
unit labor costs that have been rising faster than in the euro area as a whole over the past 
several years.  The Spanish economy is suffering the effects of an abrupt slowdown in the 
housing sector, exacerbated by tighter credit conditions faced by consumers and firms.  
Spanish approvals for home construction have moved sharply lower, house price growth 
has slowed markedly, and demand for new homes has weakened considerably. 
 
 
 
 Driven by higher energy and food prices, the twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer 
price inflation rose from below 2 percent in August to 3.6 percent in March, the highest 
rate since euro-area statistics began in January 1997.  Excluding energy and unprocessed 
food prices, inflation in March was 2.7 percent, the highest rate since early 2002. 
In the United Kingdom , data that we have received since the last Greenbook are 
consistent with the U.K. economy retaining some strength in the first quarter, though 
more forward-looking indicators point to a softening of real activity in the near term.  The 
volume of retail sales rose roughly 1 percent in both January and February following 
disappointing end-of-year sales, and the employment rate in January stood 0.2 percentage 
point higher than it was three months earlier.  However, consumer confidence slid close 
to a five-year low in March as households grew increasingly worried about their personal 
financial situation and the general economic situation over the next twelve months.  
Investment intentions in both the manufacturing and services sectors declined further in 
March, according to the Bank of England Agents‟ Survey of Business Conditions.  
According to the Bank of England‟s Credit Conditions Survey, lenders re duced the 
availability of credit “across the full range of their activities to households and 
corporat es” in the three months to mid-March.  The tightening of credit conditions was 
apparent in the housing sector, where the number and value of loans approved for house 
purchases were nearly 40 percent lower in February than a year earlier.  Halifax and 
Nationwide, two major lenders, reported that house prices were 3 to 4 percent lower in 
March than at their peak at the turn of 2007. 
Overall price pressure rose further in the intermeeting period, with both consumers and 
producers facing higher utility costs.  Manufacturers‟ input prices ramped up 20.4  percent 
over the year ending in March, their fastest pace of increase in a quarter-century, leading 
IV-26 
 
IV-27 
manufacturers to increase their output prices 6.2 percent over the same period.  Headline 
consumer price inflation was unchanged at 2.5  percent in March  after rising sharply in 
February as a result of higher electricity and natural gas prices.  Median inflation 
expectations over the coming twelve months, as measured by a Bank of England survey, 
rose to 3.3 percent in the first quarter, the highest value since the survey began in 1999. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On April 10, the Bank of England lowered the official interest rate to 5 percent, its third 
cut since December.  The Committee noted that the “prospects for output growth abroad 
[had] deteriorated ” and that business surveys suggested that “ a margin of spare capacity 
[would] emerge du ring this year .” 
In Canada , data for the first quarter continue to indicate a substantial drag from exports 
and an expansion of domestic demand.  Real exports rose in January and February, but 
remained below their average levels in the fourth quarter.  Real imports also fell because 
of declines in both machinery and equipment and consumer goods excluding automotive 
products.  The volume of retail sales grew 1 percent in January, likely boosted by a 
reduction in the sales tax, following solid fourth-quarter growth.   
Although, employment increased substantially in the first quarter (adding an additional 
86,000 jobs), actual hours worked fell 0.2 percent over the quarter.  Weather-related 
disruptions may have contributed to the fall in hours.  The twelve-month growth rate of 
nominal wages was 4.7 percent in March, down slightly from 4.9 percent in January. 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation fell more than ¾ percentage point 
from January to March, when it was 1.4 percent.  Core inflation, which excludes the eight 
most volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, edged down to 
1.3 percent, well below the 2.5 percent rate seen in the summer of 2007.  Although 
disinflation is apparent across a broad range of Canadian goods, a 7.1 percent fall in the 
prices for purchasing and leasing vehicles subtracted 0.5 percentage points from the 
twelve-month rate of headline inflation.  Food prices rose only 0.4 percent over the same 
period, in contrast with many other countries around the globe. 
The Bank of Canada cut its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent at 
its April meeting.  The Bank cited concerns over weakness in the global economy, 
reflecting a sharp slowdown in the United States and ongoing financial turbulence.

IV-29 
Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Recent indicators for emerging market economies generally point towards a moderation 
in activity, but growth remains robust.  Except for China and Malaysia, available data 
indicate that trade balances continued to decline in emerging market economies.  In many 
cases, softer growth of exports has been accompanied by strong growth of imports, 
suggesting that domestic demand has yet to slow significantly.  Headline inflation posted 
additional increases in most of the developing world, largely owing to rising food and 
energy prices.  Readings for core inflation have also shot up in a number of countries.  
Since the March Greenbook, authorities in China, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Brazil 
have tightened monetary conditions.  
 
 
 In China , staff estimates that real GDP grew at a surprisingly strong 10.8 percent 
(s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter.  Data on retail sales and fixed asset investment suggest that 
domestic demand has strengthened further; retail sales in the first quarter were up more 
than 20 percent from their year-earlier levels,  and nominal fixed asset investment was up 
nearly 25 percent.  However, external demand continued to weaken, as indicated by a 
further deceleration of the value of exports in the first quarter.  Despite the slowing of 
exports, the trade surplus in the first quarter increased —albeit only a litt le—as imports 
decelerated more than exports.     
Twelve-month consumer price inflation moderated somewhat, to about 8¼ percent in 
March, due to some deceleration in food prices.  Food price inflation, however, remains 
elevated.  In mid- March, the People‟s  Bank of China (PBOC) raised the required reserve 
ratio (RRR) for banks by ½ percentage point, and this ratio was raised again in mid-April 
by another ½ percentage point immediately following the first-quarter GDP data release.  
The latest increase, the sixteenth since the middle of 2006, brings the RRR to 16 percent 
for large banks.  Twelve-month growth of money supply and credit both decreased 
significantly in March.  Despite more RMB appreciation against the dollar in recent 
months, the PBOC has continued to accumulate international reserves at a rapid rate; 
reserves reached nearly $1.7 trillion in March, up about $150 billion so far this year.          
IV-30 
 
 
Industrial production in India rebounded in February, more than reversing its January 
decline, reflecting improvements in the mining and electricity sectors.  The current 
a
ccount deficit widened to 1.7 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007, largel y 
re
flecting an increase in the merchandise trade deficit.  In the first two months of 2008, 
the trade deficit remained elevated, with both exports and imports growing more than 
30 percent from the year earlier.  Consumer price inflation held relatively constant in 
F
ebruary, as did wholesale price inflation.  In March, however, wholesale inflation rose 
to 
a twelve-month rate of 6.4 percent from the 4.7 percent reading for February, 
sugg
esting that consumer price inflation will rise as well.  This increase largely reflects 
hig
her food prices and a recent government decision to pass through more of the rise in 
oil prices.  The government has recently adopted measures to stem inflation, including an 
e
xport ban on non-basmati rice and a reduction of the import duty on edible oils.  The 
c
entral bank raised banks‟ required cash reserve ratio ½ percentage point to 8 percent in 
mid-April. 
IV-31 
 
IV-32 
 
 
IV-33 
With the exception of Singapore, incoming data point to a moderation of activity in the 
fir
st quarter across the NIEs.1  After rebounding in January, industrial production fell in 
February, and trade balances so far this year generally continued to decline.  Consumer 
se
ntiment weakened in South Korea, and Taiwan‟s leading economic index continued to 
fall.  In Singapore, however, activity in the volatile biomedical sector rebounded sharply 
fr
om a contraction in the previous quarter, which we estimate propelled real GDP growth 
in
to double-digit territory in the first quarter.  
 
 Twelve-month consumer price inflation remained elevated, owing mainly to higher food 
and, in some cases, energy prices.  Inflation concerns prompted central banks in 
Singapore and Taiwan to tighten monetary policy.  In mid-April, the Monetary Authority 
of Singapore (MAS) announced an upward shift of the exchange rate policy band to 
allow a more rapid appreciation of the Singapore dollar.  The central bank of Taiwan 
raised its benchmark interest rate 12½ basis points to 3.5 percent. 
In Taiwan, the opposition party‟s (KMT) candidate Ma Ying -Jeou won the presidential 
election.  His victory is expected to strengthen economic and political ties between 
Taiwan and mainland China.  In Korea, the conservative Grand National Party of newly 
elected President Lee Myung-bak won the majority of seats in the parliamentary 
elections, which should facilitate the implementation of his economic reforms.

Incoming data from the ASEAN-4  have been mixed.  February industrial production 
readings indicate slowing and in some cases contraction.  Countries in the region 
generally experienced slowdowns in their exports, although, in Malaysia, exports reached 
a 15-month high in February due to strong fuel and palm oil exports.  On the positive 
side, despite weakening demand in Europe and the United States, domestic consumption 
continued to support economic activity.  For example, retail sales in Indonesia increased 
significantly over the first two months, and anecdotal evidence points towards similar 
patterns in the other countries.  Across the region, increased food and energy prices 
continued to push consumer price inflation higher.

Recent indicators in Mexico have been mixed.  After signs of slowing during the fourth 
qua
rter of 2007, industrial production rebounded in January but contracted in February. 
R
etail and wholesale sales posted strong gains over the same period, and both business 
and residential investment registered large increases in January.  Preliminary indicators of 
manufacturing activity, however, point towards weakness in March.  During the first two 
months of 2008, the trade deficit widened, reflecting stronger imports for intermediate 
inputs and capital goods together with softer export.  Headline inflation in March reached 
4¼ percent, outside the range targeted by the central bank.  Both food and core inflation 
continue to put upward pressures on consumer prices.  
 
 
 
 
In Brazil , recent data suggest that activity moderated in the first quarter.  Both industrial 
production and retail sales declined in February, although vehicle sales were strong.  
C
apacity utilization rates have tapered off, but remain elevated.  The current account 
de
ficit continued to widen on average in the first two months of 2008, with imports 
increasing rapidly and exports slowing some.  Capital goods imports have leveled off in 
re
cent months, but were still up by over 50 percent from their year-earlier levels.  
I
nflation has increased over the past year, reaching 4.7 percent over the twelve months 
e
nding in March.  Food prices contributed the most to the increase in inflation, and core 
IV-40 
inflation (which excludes food and energy and other government-administered prices) 
rose
 to nearly 4½ percent.  In a surprise move, the Brazilian central bank raised its policy 
rate 50 b asis p oints to 11.75 percent; most analysts expected a 25-b asis-p oints hike.  In its 
statement, the central bank explaine d this decision as an attempt to preempt additional 
infla
tionary pressures that could result in the need for more extensive monetary 
tightening. 
 
 
 
Real GDP growth in Argentina  continued to be strong in the fourth quarter of 2007, 
posting an increase of 8 percent (s.a.a.r.).  For the year as a whole, the economy grew 
9.2 percent, marking the fifth consecutive year of extraordinary growth.  The increase in 
c
ommodity prices in international markets continues to provide stimulus to agricultural 
production and exports.  During the first two months of 2008, the trade surplus has 
widened, despite a substantial increase in imports.  In an attempt to reduce upward 
pressures on domestic food prices, the government recently raised export taxes on several 
agricultural products, including soybean, grains and oilseeds.  Consumer prices in the 
first quarter of 2008 increased 8.5 percent from a year earlier, amid large increases in 
se
rvices prices such as housing, transportation and health.  Allegations that authorities 
understate the rate of inflation continue. 
 
IV-41 
 
 
 
 In Venezuela, private manufacturing activity  moderated in January and the  
unemployment rate increased to 8.7 percent.  Consumer price inflation continued to 
increase in the first quarter, reaching nearly 28 percent on a twelve-month basis in March.  
Economic management continues to be inept.  In April, President Chavez announced the 
na
tionalizations of the cement industry and of the c ountry‟s largest steel company.  
Mexican and French companies own the main cement companies affected, while the steel 
company is majority-owned by an Argentine company.  The government also seized 
30 sugarcane plantations. 
Recently, President Chavez has suggested that capital controls might be relaxed to make 
the exchange rate regime more flexible but that the government would not eliminate 
currency controls altogether.  In recent months, the government has been intervening to 
reduce the dollar‟s premium on the black market .  The premium had peaked at over 
200 percent in late 2007 and has since fallen to about 70 percent.

In Turkey, real GDP increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter, thanks to strong private 
sector investment.  After a large increase during the month of January, industrial 
pr
oduction in February showed signs of moderation.  Twelve-month consumer price 
inflation reached 9.2 percent in March, significantly higher than the upper limit of the 
c
entral bank‟s year-end target of 4 percent +/- 2 percentage points.  Food and energy 
prices continue to put upward pressure on inflation.  After six consecutive benchmark 
interest rate cuts, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep policy rates unchanged 
in March.  The Committee indicated that global uncertainty and adverse developments in 
food and energy prices have increased the need for a more cautious policy.
