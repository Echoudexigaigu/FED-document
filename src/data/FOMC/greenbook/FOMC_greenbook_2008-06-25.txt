Domestic Nonfinancial Developments  
II-1 The economy appears to have remained soft in recent months but does not yet show the 
sharp break in activity that has been charac teristic of most recessions in the past.  
Consumer sentiment has fallen to historically  low levels this spring, and sales of motor 
vehicles have dropped noticeably, although othe r consumer spending has held up well.  
Investment in business equipment appears to  have slipped a bit further in the second 
quarter, and homebuilding remained on a steep descent.  Manufacturing activity 
deteriorated in April and May, and forward-looking indicators  suggest that conditions in 
this sector will remain soft.  In the labor market, payroll employment continued to post 
modest declines in April and May, and the unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent.  
While core consumer price inflation has rema ined relatively stable in recent months, 
headline inflation has remained elevated beca use of continued large increases in food and 
energy prices. 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor demand remains on a gradual downward de scent.  Private payroll employment fell 
an average of 53,000 per month in April a nd May following averag e declines of 97,000 
per month in the first quarter.1  Declines have been wide spread during the first five 
months of the year, with the notable ex ceptions of nonbusiness services such as 
education, health, and food serv ices.  Meanwhile, the workweek held steady at 33.7 hours 
in May, the same as its first-quarter aver age.  And aggregate hours of production and 
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payro lls fell at an average monthly rate of 
0.2 percent over the past two months. 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te jumped to 5.5 percent in May from 
5 percent in April.  Last month’s increase was accompanied by a rise  in the labor force 
participation rate, especially among those aged  16 to 24, and we think that some of the 
surge in the unemployment rate may be rela ted to difficulties in adjusting for seasonal 
flows of young people in to the labor force.2  Nevertheless, unemplo yment rates rose in  
                                                 
1 Payroll employment in recent months has been held down by a strike at American Axle & 
Manufacturing, which ended on May 22.  The strike affected production at nine General Motors (GM) 
truck assembly plants and nearly two dozen parts plants at various times over the past three months.  In 
addition, contract disputes over local issues—which had shut down two GM assembly plants for several 
weeks—were also resolved near the end of May.  Neither  the workers on strike nor those indirectly affected 
by the strikes returned to work in time to be counted in the May employment figures.  We expect their 
return to add between 20,000 and 30,000 to the change in employment in June.   
2 Indeed, unemployed re-entrants and new entrants accounted for the bulk of the increase in 
unemployment in May.  Since young people are primar ily labor force entrants, May’s rise in entrants 
corroborates the notion that seasonal flows were part of the story behind the jump in unemployment in May.

older age groups as well, albeit by not as much as for young people, and the number of 
unemployed job losers increased further in Ma y.  On average over the past two months, 
the unemployment rate has moved up about ¼ percentage point from its first-quarter 
average of 4.9 percent to a level that is ¾ pe rcentage point above its recent low at the end 
of 2006. 
Some—but not all—indicators of labor market conditions have also continued to worsen.  
In the household survey, job losers unemployed less than five weeks have risen further as 
a percentage of employment since March, and the fraction of workers who are working 
part time for economic reasons has continued to move up.  In addition, perceptions of job availability in the Conference Board survey and of the difficulty of filling vacancies in 
the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey have eroded further since March, as have households’ expecta tions for labor market conditions in the 
Reuters/University of Michigan and Confer ence Board surveys.  Moreover, the most 
recent readings on net hiring plans from both the Manpower and NFIB surveys moved down, and the level of insured unemployment ha s continued to move up.  However, in 
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, the job openings rate  and the hiring rate 
both turned up in April (the latest available data), while the rate of layoffs and discharges fell back toward last summer’s levels. 
The staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 2¾ percent in the first quarter, which brought the increase over the previous four 
quarters to 3¼ percent.  The increase in pr oductivity over the past ye ar is quite robust, 
especially given the concurrent weakening in economic growth.  However, the strong 
gains in productivity follow a year of particularly sluggish productivity growth.

Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) moved down 0.2 per cent in May after a 0.7 percent drop in 
April.  This recent weakness has not been c onfined to motor vehicles and construction 
supplies; the three-month IP diffusion inde x remained below 50 in May after falling 
sharply in April.  Manufacturing output also fell in April and was unchanged in May, 
putting the index on track to post its third c onsecutive quarterly d ecline.  The factory 
operating rate dipped to 77.5 percent in May, a level 2.2 percentage points below its long-
run average. 
Motor vehicle production moved up in May even though assemblies were held down by 
weak demand and strikes at several plants .  We estimate that these strikes reduced 
production at General Motors by almost 1 millio n units (annual rate) from March to May.  
At the same time, soft demand for full-size pickups and sport-utilit y vehicles led other 
domestic producers to scale back their assembly rates. The modest pace of vehicle production over the past few months has kept inventories in 
check even as sales have plunged.  Days’ s upply at the end of May stood at 69, a level 
only somewhat higher than the desired ratio.  With the end of several strikes in May, the 
automakers plan to increase the pace of assemblies in June to an annual rate of 
10.1 million units.  If reali zed, this rebound in assemblies and parts production would 
contribute nearly ¼ percentage point to the change in IP in June.  Initial plans for 
assemblies in the third quarter call for production to step up further. 
High-tech production decelerated further in April and May after growth slowed sharply in 
the first quarter.  Computer output increased ½ percent, on average, in April and May, well below its pace of 2007.  The output of communications equipment slowed in May 
after having risen at a solid pace in April.  Semiconductor production also decelerated in April and May, as continued weakness in the demand for cell phones and consumer PCs 
resulted in slower production for some chip types. 
Looking ahead, available indicators point to only modest gains in  high-technology output 
in the next few months.  The Internationa l Data Corporation recently revised down its 
2008 forecast for PC demand and expects unit sales only to edge up this quarter.  In 
addition, recent statements from Dell and He wlett-Packard have expressed concern about 
weak U.S. demand.  And guidance by telecommunications service providers suggests that 
their capital expenditures will decline in the remainder of the year.  For semiconductors, 
Intel’s revenue guidance for the second quarter is consistent with a solid increase in 
microprocessor output, but in other chip categorie s, efforts to pare elevated inventories

may restrain production.  Meanwhile, the book- to-bill ratio for circuit boards climbed 
back above 1 after several m onths of declining orders. 
Output excluding the energy, high-tech, and mo tor vehicles sectors moved down in April 
and May.  The index for business equipment c ontracted nearly 2 pe rcent in April and 
slipped further in May as the production of industrial and other equipment declined.  
Output of consumer goods decreased in April and May, with particularly weak 
production of durable consumer goods. 
Output of construction supplies, which fell in  April and edged down in May, has declined 
nearly 10 percent since its peak in January  2006.  Output of products associated with 
nonresidential construction, whic h had previously offset so me of the production losses 
related to residential investment, has turned down in recent months.  Production of 
durable materials that are destined for furt her processing in the i ndustrial sector also 
stepped down in April and May after havi ng been unchanged, on balance, since mid-
2007. 
Forward-looking indicators of production have  been mixed; on balance, they suggest 
continued softness in the manu facturing sector.  The three- month moving average of real 
adjusted durable goods orders has increased, on net, since the start of  the year.  Although 
the May reading of the Institute for Suppl y Management (ISM) diffusion index for new 
orders edged up, this index continued to suggest declining orders.  Meanwhile, the 
Empire State new orders diffusion index m oved down to a modestly  negative level in 
June, while other regional new orders indexes remained at more neutral levels through 
May.  And the inventory-shipments ratio fr om the staff’s flow-of-goods system has 
trended upward in recent months, which may imply production cutbacks in the future. 
Motor Vehicles 
Demand for light vehicles has de teriorated significantly in r ecent months.  Sales tumbled 
to an average annual rate of 14.3 million units  in April and May, nearly 1 million units 
below the pace in the first quarter.   
.  In addition, the sharp increase in  gasoline prices over the past few months 
appears to have accelerated th e shift in consumer demand away from trucks and toward 
cars:  The share of pickups, vans, and sport-ut ility vehicles in total sales plunged in April 
and May, while the share of small cars shot up.  As a result, the domestic market share of 
the Detroit Three automakers, which rely he avily on sales in the full-size pickup and 
sport-utility categories, ha s continued to move down.

Indicators suggest that motor vehicle sales will fall further in June.  The availability of 
cash rebates and cut-rate financ ing has decreased so far in Ju ne, and consumers’ views of 
car-buying conditions have con tinued to deteriorate.   
 
 
. 
Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) ro se at an annual rate of 1 percent in the 
first quarter, but spending app ears to have picked up moderate ly since then.  In light of 
the latest retail sales data, we estimate that  real expenditures on goods other than motor 
vehicles increased a robust ½ percent, on average, in Ap ril and May—although, as just 
noted, retail purchases of motor vehicles have been quite weak.  Outside of the volatile 
energy category, real outlays on services we re also reported to have expanded through 
April.  However, real-time estimates for servi ces are often extrapolations of past trends 
that may not reflect the actual pace of spending.3 
While spending in May appears to have r eceived a boost from th e tax rebates, the 
fundamentals for consumer spending have deteri orated.  In particular, real income has 
increased at an average annual rate of just 1 percent since last summer, as labor market 
conditions have deteriorated a nd rising food and energy prices have put a sizable dent in 
consumers’ purchasing power.4  In addition, the ratio of household wealth to income 
dropped sharply in the fourth and first quart ers, developments that reflect declining 
values of both equities and houses.  As measured by the Reuters/Michigan and 
Conference Board surveys, consumer sent iment dropped again in May, continuing the 
vertiginous decline that bega n last summer.  Sentiment fe ll further in the preliminary 
Reuters/Michigan survey for June.  Both meas ures of consumer sentiment stand near the 
low points reached during the 1990-91 recession .  On a more positive note, consumer 
credit supply conditions do not appear to have  worsened.  Interest rates on consumer 
loans continue to decline in re sponse to the drop in short-term  interest rates, and growth 
in consumer credit has not yet slowed desp ite reports of tight terms and standards. 
                                                 
3 Because the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) l acks timely data on many categories of services 
consumption, spending on services has been subject to no ticeable downward revisions around the start of 
downturns in economic activity. 
4 The weakness in real income is evident despite a notable upward revision of $26 billion to the BEA’s 
estimate of nominal wages and salaries in the four th quarter—reflecting information from unemployment 
insurance tax records—and a boost to wages and salaries in January through March from an estimated 
temporary increase of $15 billion in bonus payments.

Housing  
Activity in the housing sector remains very weak.  In May, single-family starts dropped 
to an annual rate of 674,000 units.  This pace of construction is 36 pe rcent below its level 
in July 2007, before the escalation of the tu rmoil in mortgage markets, and 63 percent 
below its peak in early 2006.  Adjusted permits—an informative indicator of housing 
starts in the following month—slid to an  annual rate of 631,000 units in May.  
Multifamily starts were at an annual rate  of 301,000 units in May, only somewhat below 
their average since 1995. 
Although production cuts have helped pare in ventories of new si ngle-family homes by 
20 percent since their peak, new home sales ha ve continued to dete riorate sharply, which 
has pushed up the months’ supply of new homes for sale to levels not seen since the early 
1980s.  The Census Bureau’s measure of new sales agreements dropped another 7½ percent in March and April.   
 
.
5  
Meanwhile, sales of existing single-family home s have also been little changed, on net, 
so far this year after having fallen 14 percent in the latter half of 2007.  The index of pending home sales—an indicator of existi ng home sales one or two months hence—
jumped in April to its highest reading in six months. 
Much of the deterioration of the housing se ctor since mid-2007 is associated with the 
drag on demand from tight conditions in mort gage credit markets.  These problems are 
particularly apparent for nonconforming mortgages that cannot be purchased by 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)—such as nonprime and nonconforming jumbo mortgages—for which spreads relative to c onforming loans have remained elevated and 
new originations have fallen dramatically.  Moreover, although recent  legislation created 
a new class of conforming loans with higher lo an limits in high-priced cities, the market 
for these new jumbo conforming loans has been slow to develop, and offer rates for these loans are still 25 to 50 basis points above those for standard conforming loans.
6  In 
contrast, conditions in the conforming market  are much better, as rates for standard  
                                                 
5 
 
. 
6 Even before the mortgage-market turmoil, offer rates for prime jumbo loans were about 25 basis 
points above those in the conforming market, likely because of a higher risk of prepayment and the lower 
liquidity of private-label mortgage-backed securities.

7 However, these rates are now available to fewer buyers, as the GSEs have adopted more-stringent 
lending standards and are charging hi gher “delivery fees” fo r loans to borrowers with lower credit scores 
and less collateral.   30-year fixed-rate mortgages—at about 6¼ pe rcent—remain low by historical standards.7  
Beyond their effect on housing demand, financ ial market conditions may also be 
crimping the supply of new housing.  Recent anecdotes from builders suggest that 
tightening lending standards for acquisition, development, and construction loans are 
putting downward pressure on planned building activity, even in markets that have not 
experienced an appreciable reduction in demand. 
House prices continue to fall.  The monthl y version of the purchase-only repeat-sales 
price index calculated by the Office of Fede ral Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) 
decreased at an annual rate of 4¼ percent ov er the three months ending in March.  The 
10-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat -sales price index—which, unlike the OFHEO 
index, includes houses financed by nonconforming loans and is more heavily 
concentrated in urban areas that had seen  a more substantial run-up of house prices—
tumbled at an annual rate of 26 percent ove r the same period.  Meanwhile, the constant-
quality price index for new homes fell at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter.  
Although these lower prices may eventually he lp bolster sales, th e large proportion of 
respondents in the Reuters/Michigan survey who expect further declines in house prices over the coming year may signa l ongoing hesitation to enter the market on the part of 
many prospective buyers. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) appears to be moving down further in 
the second quarter after a slight decrease in the first quarter.  Business outlays for motor 
vehicles have declined substantially, and real E&S excluding transportation appears to 
have been roughly flat since the beginning of the year.  The fundamental determinants of 
E&S spending are largely consistent with the slowdown we have seen to date, as business 
output growth has decelerated and the user co st of capital has not de clined at the rapid 
pace seen in earlier years. 
On balance, monthly surveys of busin ess conditions—both national and regional—
remain downbeat.  In addition to its monthl y survey, the ISM released its semiannual 
economic forecast in May:  For the first ti me since 2003, the number of manufacturing 
firms expecting a decrease in their capital e xpenditures in the current year now slightly 
exceeds the number expecting an increase.  Mo st corporate bond yields have increased

since the April Greenbook, and although spread s over Treasury yields have come down 
further over this period, they remain at elevated levels. 
Business outlays on transportation equipment ha ve continued to fall at a rapid pace in 
recent months.  Business-sector spending for mo tor vehicles softened further in April and 
May after having declined in the first quarter.  Automakers continued to scale back 
deliveries of fleet vehicles to daily rental  companies, and demand from other businesses 
also receded.  Sales of medium and heavy tr ucks in April and May continued, on average, 
at the subdued pace recorded in the first quar ter.  With lackluster volumes for freight 
shipping, the pace of new orders  in recent months has been sluggish, suggesting that sales 
of medium and heavy trucks ar e unlikely to improve much in the near term.  Meanwhile, 
April data on shipments and net exports suggest that domestic aircraft outlays remained relatively stable in the second quarter. 
Real outlays on high-tech equipment and softwa re have increased at a subpar pace so far 
this year.  The latest data from the Quarterl y Services Survey show a moderate rise in 
spending on software in the first quarter.  More recently, industrial production of 
computers suggests only a tepid in crease in real computer outlays  this quarter.  Domestic 
spending on communications equipment was about flat in the first qua rter, and shipments 
moved down in April. After having posted modest declines in the prior two quarters, business spending on 
equipment outside of high-tech and transportatio n seems to have remained weak so far in 
the current quarter.  Although orders and shipments for this category of equipment 
increased noticeably in April, net exports of these capital goods also stepped up, an 
indication that a sizable fracti on of demand is from abroad. 
Nonresidential Construction  
Real spending on nonresidential  structures excluding drilli ng and mining rose at an 
annual rate of 3¾ percent in the first quart er, down substantially from the double-digit 
gains posted throughout 2006 and 2007.  This deceler ation is largely consistent with the 
evolving fundamentals in this sector.  Data from commercial property markets show that 
sales of existing properties have plunged from la st year’s record levels, and prices appear 
to be leveling out.  Moreover, the market fo r commercial mortgage-backed securities is 
moribund, spreads for corporate bonds remain wide, and recent Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Surveys show that most banks are tightening lending standards for commercial 
real estate loans.  Signs that the supply of  space may be starting to outpace demand have 
also begun to emerge:  Vacancy rates for office and industrial space ticked up in the first

8 Part of the substantial run-up in the flow-of-goods estimate of months’ supply reflects weak domestic 
absorption, which appears in the denominator of these ratios.  If inventories are instead compared with a 
measure of shipments that includes the large contribution of net exports, the recent run-up remains, 
although it is somewhat less striking. quarter following several years of steady decl ines, while rates for retail space continued 
to move upward.  The three-month average of  the architectural b illings diffusion index—
which is fairly well correlated with construc tion at a horizon of tw o quarters or so—has 
moved down sharply of late, which sugge sts outright declines  in nonresidential 
construction spending in the second half of this year. 
The BEA estimates that real spending on dr illing and mining structures dipped at an 
annual rate of 6½ percent in the first quarter  on the heels of robust growth during 2007.  
Although escalating energy prices have been stimulating activity in th is sector for some 
time, spending has been uneven from quarter to quarter.  Incoming data on footage drilled 
and the number of drilling rigs in operation point to a resump tion of gains in investment 
in the second quarter. 
Business Inventories  
Real nonfarm inventories excludi ng motor vehicles rose only slightly in the fourth and 
first quarters, as firms cut production to keep  inventories aligned w ith the sluggish pace 
of sales.  The indicators we track are se nding mixed signals concer ning whether firms are 
holding excess inventories.  According to Census Bureau data, the ratio of book-value 
inventories to sales (excluding motor vehicles  and parts) ticked down in April and has 
changed relatively little, on net, since mid- 2007.  Industry detail also provides little 
indication of widespread imbalances.  In addition, businesses surveyed by the ISM in 
May reported that their customers were reasonably comfortable with  their current stock 
of inventories. 
In contrast to the Census estimates, the st aff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggests 
that the months’ supply of inventories excl uding motor vehicles and parts has moved up, 
on balance, since November.  Th e recent rise in this measure has been fairly broad-based.  
Increases have been particularly evident in construction supplies and in materials.8

9 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 authorized about $115 billion in stimulus rebates, with 
$94 billion expected to be sent out by the end of July, another $5 billion dispersed in the remainder of 
calendar year 2008, and around $16 billion distributed during the tax-filing season in 2009. 
10 The amount of a rebate that exceeds a household’s income tax liability counts as a transfer payment 
in the budget rather than as a tax refund. economic activity, and outlays rose briskly.9   Adjusted for payment-timing shifts and 
financial transactions, the unifi ed budget recorded a surplus in the tax-heavy months of 
April and May that was $82 billion less than the adjusted surplus in the same period last 
year.  Over the 12 months ending in May, the adjusted deficit was $314 billion, or approximately 2¼ percent of nominal GDP. 
With a substantial portion of the stimulus re bates distributed in April and May, total net 
tax receipts during those two mont hs were 3½ percent lower than their year-earlier level.  
Excluding the stimulus rebates, individual in come and payroll taxes were only 4 percent 
above their year-earlier level,  likely reflecting the decelera tion in personal income.  The 
slowing in federal tax payments has been even more pronounced on the corporate side.  
In April (which includes corporations’ first quarterly estimated payments on 2008 
liabilities) and May, corporat e tax receipts were 14½ percen t below their year-earlier 
level, likely reflecting the decline in corpor ate profits since the middle of last year.  
According to daily Treasury data through June  16, corporate receipts in June, which are 
mostly firms’ second quarterly estimated paym ents on 2008 liabilities, appear to be about 
8 percent below the level of corporate payments last June. Federal outlays in April a nd May, adjusted for payment- timing shifts and financial 
transactions, were 13¾ percent above their level in the comparab le year-earlier  period.   
Defense spending rose briskly in April and May relative to the y ear-earlier period, which 
points to a solid increase in real defense purchases in the second quarter as measured in 
the national income and product accounts.  Tr ansfer payments moved up smartly relative 
to a year ago, boosted in part by a portion of the stimulus rebates sent to households with 
little or no tax liability.
10  And other outlays also were  significantly above their year-
earlier level, mostly because of an increas e in the estimated subsidy cost of federal 
programs for housing loans and student loans.  
State and Local Government Sector 
Incoming data suggest that real purchases by state and local gove rnments continued to 
rise at a sluggish pace in the second quarter after barely edging up in the first quarter.  
Nominal construction spending, which fell sharply in the first quarter, was only ½ percent 
above its first-quarter averag e in April.  Meanwhile, state and local employment

11 The preliminary data are based on reports from 41 states, including the 12 largest. 
12 Gasoline inventories rose to quite high levels earlier this year, putting downward pressure on 
margins, and refiners responded by cutting back on production.  Since then, gasoline inventories have run 
down considerably, which brought stocks to the lower end of their seasonal range, and refinery capacity 
utilization has begun to recover as the outlook for margins has improved.   increased by an average of 14,000 per month in April and May, slightly below the 
monthly pace of 18,000 new hires re corded in the first quarter. 
Recent reports suggest that state governments’ fiscal conditions have continued to erode with the slowing pace of economic activity.  According to preliminary data collected by the Rockefeller Institute of G overnment, state governments’ tax revenues rose at a tepid 
pace in the first quarter.
11  Sales tax receipts were lower than their year-earlier level in the 
majority of states, at least partly because of  reported weakness in sales of housing-related 
items.  According to the National Conference of State Legislator s, growth in receipts has 
slowed more rapidly than expected by state officials when fiscal year 2008 budgets—which cover the period through June 30 for most  states—were finalized last year.  In 
addition, about half of the states are now pr ojecting that revenues will be insufficient to 
cover the amount of spending currently planne d in fiscal 2009 budgets; these states may 
have to scale back planned spending, raise taxe s, or dip into reserv e funds to meet their 
balanced-budget requirements. 
Prices  
Headline consumer price inflation has rema ined elevated in recent months, mostly 
because of large increases in food and energy pr ices.   On the basis of the May data for 
the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), we estimate that overall 
PCE prices increased 0.5 percent in May, a ri se that would push the three-month change 
to an annual rate of just over 4 percent.  Fu rthermore, energy prices have only begun to 
reflect the recent surge in crude oil costs.  By  contrast, core consumer price inflation has 
remained relatively stable in recent months. 
We estimate that consumer energy prices move d up 4½ percent in May after no change in 
April, as a jump in gasoline prices in May more than reversed April’s decline in gas 
prices.  Retail gasoline prices had been slow to  adjust to the surge in prices for crude oil 
this spring, squeezing margins.  However, in recent weeks margins have begun to recover to more typical levels, and current survey data point to larger increases in gasoline prices in June.
12  The path of futures prices suggests crude oil costs will remain near their 
currently high levels, and if ma rgins continue to move back toward more typical levels, 
further sizable increases at the pump are likely this summer.  Retail prices for natural gas

and electricity rates have posted hefty gains in  recent months in response to the surge in 
crude energy costs, and spot prices for natural gas set at Henry Hub have climbed further 
in recent weeks.  All told, retail energy prices have risen more than 12 percent over the 
12 months ending in May, much more than  their increase over the preceding year. 
PCE food prices are estimated to have rise n 0.3 percent in May after having increased 
0.9 percent in April, putting the estimated a nnualized three-month change through May at 
nearly 6 percent.   Most spot prices for fa rm crops have increased further since the April 
Greenbook.  Although wheat prices have edged down 1 percent in response to early 
reports of plentiful yields for U.S. winter wheat, corn and soybean prices have climbed 
further in response to wet weather and flooding in some Midwest growing areas.  
Livestock prices have also moved up in rece nt weeks, partly reflecting stronger demand 
from abroad.  Even so, futures prices fo r farm products remain consistent with a 
significant deceleration in crude food costs later this year. 
Excluding food and energy, PCE prices are estim ated to have increased 0.2 percent in 
May after a rise of 0.1 percen t in April.  Over the 12 months ending in May, core PCE 
prices are estimated to have risen 2.1 percen t, up slightly from a year earlier.  While 
prices of goods and some services have accelerated over the past  year—likely boosted by 
rising import prices and energy costs—the inde xes for housing and medical services have 
decelerated. Some measures of near-term inflation expecta tions have risen sharply in the past couple 
of months, while measures of longer-term expectations have ranged from unchanged to 
up slightly.  In the Reuters/Mi chigan survey, the median exp ectation for inflation over the 
next 12 months continued its upward climb in May as participants reported concerns over 
food and energy price increases; median expe ctations were 5.1 percent in the June 
preliminary report, about the same as in May.  Median expectations for inflation over the 
next 5 to 10 years moved higher, to 3.4 percen t, in May and remained at that level in 
June; this figure is the hi ghest reading since 1995.  A ccording to the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, four-quarter-ahead  CPI inflation expectations increased 
0.3 percentage point in the second quarter, wh ile inflation expectati ons over the next 10 
years were unchanged.  Five-year infla tion compensation derived from Treasury 
inflation-protected securities (TIPS) moved up further over the intermeeting period to 2.4  percent, about 25 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year.  Inflation 
compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was roughly flat over the intermeeting period and has 
only edged up, on balance, from its value at the turn of the year.

13 The BEA’s upward revision to wages and salaries in the fourth quarter boosted the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics’ estimated increase in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector to an annual rate of 
6.6 percent, compared with the 4.7 percent estimate reported previously.   Excluding food and energy, prices at earlier st ages of processing ro se rapidly through 
May but have eased a bit in recent weeks.  The PPI for core intermediate materials 
advanced 2.0 percent in May following a stri ng of large monthly increases, bringing the 
three-month change to an annual rate of 18½ percent.  Price increases were widespread across materials but were particularly mark ed for metal products and energy-intensive 
categories, such as chemicals and plastics.  The PPIs for rail trans portation, trucking, and 
delivery services also posted sizable increases in May. 
In recent weeks, spot prices for a number of metals have partly  retraced their large 
increases of earlier in the year.  The Journal of Commerce  (JOC) metals index has 
declined about 11 percent since its peak in April and now st ands only 6 percent above its 
year-earlier level.  As a resu lt, the Commodity Research Bure au’s spot index of industrial 
materials has declined 4¾ percent since th e April Greenbook, whereas the JOC index of 
industrial materials, which includes energy products, is unchanged on balance. 
Labor Costs 
Despite higher overall consumer price inflat ion, hourly compensation has continued to 
rise at a moderate pace.  The employment cost index for private-industry workers rose at 
an annual rate of 3 percent over the three months ending in March, in line with its 
average over the previous three years.  Wage s and salaries rose at  an annual rate of 
3.4 percent during this period, and benefits costs rose at a rate of 2.3 percent—both about the same as in 2007.  And nonproduction bonuses in the three months ending in March 
also rose at about the same rate as in 2007, despite reports that Wall Street bonuses would 
be smaller this year. 
The staff estimates that nonfarm compensati on per hour increased at  an annual rate of 
nearly 5 percent in the first quarter and has risen 4 percent over th e past four quarters, 
down somewhat from its 5 percent pace a year earlier.
13  With the notable pickup in 
productivity growth, unit labor costs decel erated markedly over the past year. 
Turning to the available data for the current  quarter, average hourly  earnings increased 
0.1 percent in April and 0.3 percent in May, bringing the 12-month change ending in May 
to 3½ percent, about ½ percentage po int below its year-earlier increase.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  
 
 Overview  
Over the intermeeting period, investors marked  up considerably the expected path of 
policy in response to generally stronger-than-expected economic data and growing 
concerns about the outlook for inflation, and market quotes now place substantial odds on policy tightening in the next few months.  Nominal Treasury yields rose sharply, 
apparently as a result of wider term premiums as well as the upward shift in policy expectations.  Real yields rose by less th an their nominal counterparts, and inflation 
compensation jumped at relatively short horizons , likely reflecting the expected effects of 
surging oil prices.  Five-year-forward in flation compensation was little changed.   
Strains in short-term funding markets appear ed to ease a bit over th e intermeeting period,  
reflecting in part substantial credit extended under the Federal Reserve’s ongoing 
liquidity facilities.  In the corporate bond market, credit spreads narrowed slightly, and 
gross bond issuance surged in May.  Equity prices edged down, on net, over the intermeeting period, as the surge in oil prices  and a more pessimistic outlook for earnings 
in the financial sector weighed on the market .  Financial firms issued a large amount of 
equity shares, continuing their recapitaliza tion efforts.  Banks again registered weak 
profits in the first quarter because of elev ated loan-loss provisions, and asset quality in 
nearly all major loan categories deteriorated  further.  Household debt growth slowed 
again in the first quarter, and the perf ormance of both home mortgages and other 
household loans continued to worsen. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The expected path for the federal funds rate  rose notably over the intermeeting period.  
The decision at the April FOMC meeting to  lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis 
points prompted a modest decline in federal f unds futures rates, but these declines were 
subsequently more than reversed, as incoming data were generally firmer than expected, 
and speeches by Federal Reserve officials were interpreted as emphasizing concerns 
about the outlook for inflation, especially in  light of sharply rising energy prices.   
Market participants currently place high odds on the Committee leaving the target federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent at the June  meeting but also assign some probability to 
a policy tightening at the upcoming meeting.  Futures markets have priced in nearly  50 basis points of rate increases by the Oc tober meeting, and they imply cumulative 
policy tightening of about 200 basis points over the coming two years, 85 basis points 
more than was expected at the time of the la st FOMC meeting.  In contrast, the Desk’s 
survey of primary dealers indicates that most  expect the federal funds rate to remain

 unchanged through the first quarter of 2009 and to reach 2.75 percent by the end of that 
year, implying about 100 basis points less tig htening than is priced in by market 
participants.  The distribution of the federal funds rate six months ahead became a bit more skewed toward higher rates, and op tion-implied measures of uncertainty about 
policy rates six months to two y ears ahead increased noticeably.   
The yield on nominal 2-year Tr easury securities rose 62 basi s points, on net, owing to the 
shift in policy expectations a nd an apparent increase in te rm premiums.  Most of the 
increase in nominal yields occurred in intervals around data releases and speeches by 
FOMC members.  Meanwhile, yields on 5-year  and 10-year nominal Treasury securities 
moved up about 55 and 40 basis points, respectively.   
Real yields rose much less, implying a rise in inflation compensati on.  The increase in 
inflation compensation was concentrated at very short horizons a nd likely was mainly 
due to the expected effects of the substantial increase in  oil prices since the April 
meeting.  Survey evidence also  suggests that higher expectations of, and uncertainty 
about, inflation likely contribute d to the rise in inflation co mpensation at short to medium 
horizons.  All told, inflation compensation over the next five years increased about 
40 basis points, while five-year-forward infla tion compensation was little changed on net.  
Money Market Functioning 
Over the intermeeting period, strains in some  short-term funding markets appeared to 
ease a bit.  Notably, spreads of one- and th ree-month Libor over comparable-maturity 
overnight index swap (OIS) ra tes narrowed about 35 and 20 basis points, respectively, on 
net.  For longer maturities, however, liqui dity remained thin, and corresponding term 
Libor spreads over OIS were little cha nged on balance.  Spreads on 30-day A2/P2 
nonfinancial commercial paper and asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) also 
declined.  The Federal Reserve’s liquidity pr ograms may have helped to ease short-term 
strains.  Primary credit outstanding—both ove rnight and term—continued to increase, 
presumably due in part to the narrow spread  of the primary credit rate over the federal 
funds rate and the ability of depository institu tions to borrow for longer terms.  Offerings 
at the Term Auction Facility in May and J une were fully subscribed; however, with a 
significantly increased amount offered, the stop-out  rates were lower th an those in earlier 
months and often well below one-month Libor.  Some quarter-end pre ssures were evident 
in short-term interest rates late in th e intermeeting period, but anecdotally, market 
participants are not especially  concerned about their ability to obtain funding over the end 
of the quarter.

 Conditions in the Treasury general collate ral (GC) repo and bill markets generally 
remained healthy.  Functioning in these markets was likely supported, in part, by further 
sales of Treasury securities from the Syst em Open Market Account portfolio and the 
substantial amount of Treasury securities lent through the Te rm Security Lending Facility 
(TSLF).  Of the seven TSLF auctions held during the intermeeting period, only the most 
recent one, on June 12, received bids that exceeded the amount on offer.  The modest 
demand at these auctions likely reflects some improvements in dealers’ access to financing.  The renewed interest  at the most recent auction reportedly reflected liquidity 
demands in advance of the upcoming quarter-e nd.  For lower-quality collateral, market 
functioning remained impaired, with medi an haircuts on non-Treasury and non-agency 
collateral only a touch below the very elevat ed levels seen earlie r in the spring.  On 
balance, however, dealers appeared able to secure funding from market sources, and 
lending through the Primary Dealer Credit Fa cility (PDCF) decreased, although a few 
institutions have continued to access the PDCF regularly. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes fell 1 percent to 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
as the effect of generally positive economic data releases was outweighed by higher oil 
prices and increased concerns  about the earnings outlook for the financial sector.  As a 
result, stocks of securiti es broker-dealers and banks markedly underperformed the 
broader market.  The spread between the 12- month-forward trend earnings-to-price ratio 
for S&P 500 firms and a real long-term Treasury yield--a rough gauge of the equity risk 
premium--ticked up to the high end of its range over the past two decades.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index sees awed over the intermeeting period but is 
little changed on net.  
Yields on BBB-rated and specu lative-grade corporate bonds rose less than those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities, l eaving their spreads somewhat lower over the 
intermeeting period.  Both indexes of corporate bond spreads stayed  substantially below 
their peaks in March but remained elevated by historical standards.  Despite the sharp 
decline in equity prices for the financial sector, credit default swap (CDS) indexes for this 
sector rose only moderately, on balance, an indication that market concerns about default 
risk did not worsen appreciably.  Estimated bid-asked spreads (not shown) suggest that 
the secondary market for corporate bonds con tinued to function well.  In the secondary 
market for leveraged syndicated loans, c onditions improved somewhat, and the average 
bid-asked spread narrowed about 25 basis points.

 Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With nearly all company reports for the firs t quarter in hand, earnings per share for S&P 
500 firms are estimated to have fallen 18 percent from the year-earlier level, less than the 
25 percent drop in the fourth quarter.  Wr ite-downs and provisioning by financial firms 
accounted for most the weakness in both quarter s.  In contrast, earnings per share for 
nonfinancial firms in the first quarter are es timated to have risen 10 percent from the 
year-earlier level, boosted by large gains for the oil and gas industry.  Looking ahead, 
analyst estimates for year-ahead earnings for financial firms--and for the S&P 500 as a 
whole--were revised down in May, while th e corresponding revisions for nonfinancial 
firms jumped into positive territory because of  a sharp rise in energy sector forecasts. 
The available data, though stale in some cases, indicate that overall nonfinancial 
corporate credit quality has generally remained solid.  The aggregate ra tio of liquid assets 
to total assets for nonfinancial firms stayed high in the fourth quarter, and the aggregate 
leverage ratio moved up only slightly from a low level.   And although the delinquency 
rate on commercial and industrial (C&I) loan s ticked up in the firs t quarter, it remained 
low by historical standards.  The realized  six-month default rate on corporate bonds 
remained near zero in April, and there were few ratings changes for nonfinancial 
corporations in the first quarter.  In May, the KMV forecast of the aggregate year-ahead 
default rate continued to hover near the middle of its 15-year historical range. 
Business Finance 
Both investment-grade and speculative-gra de bond issuance by nonfinancial companies 
surged in May, buoyed in part by the relative st ability of yield spreads, which may have 
made it easier for issuers and investors to agree on deal terms.  Meanwhile, total 
outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper co ntracted again in May, and C&I loan 
growth slowed markedly.  This pattern of debt financing flows sugge sts that some firms 
are lengthening the maturity of liabilities to  improve liquidity.  Aggregating across bonds, 
commercial paper, and C&I loans, net debt fi nancing by nonfinancial firms was strong in 
May, though issuance of institutional leverage d loans reportedly continued to be very 
weak.  Issuance of both convertible bonds and e quity shares by financial corporations in 
April and May was very high by historical st andards, reflecting recapitalization by large 
financial institutions. 
Net equity retirements by nonfinancial firms are estimated to have ebbed a bit in the first 
quarter from last year’s record levels.  The volume of retirements from completed cash-
financed mergers dropped notably, while those resulting from share repurchases are also

 estimated to have cooled somewhat.  In th e second quarter, retirements from completed 
cash-financed mergers and announcements of new repurchase programs slowed further.  
On the other side of the ledger, gross public  issuance of equity picked up in May, though 
almost entirely because of seasoned offerings; there were scant initial public offerings.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Growth of commercial mortgage  debt moderated in the first quarter, and the market for 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMB S) has remained virtually shut down.  
Yields on investment-grade CMBS (not s hown) have been pers istently high, likely 
discouraging new issuance.  Spreads on CDS indexes for CMBS, while below their highs 
earlier in the year, remained quite elevated.  Moreover, the sales volume for existing 
commercial properties slowed further in April and May. 
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages he ld by commercial banks climbed further 
in the first quarter.  Much of the incr ease was due to delinqu encies on residential 
construction loans, but delinquencies on nonr esidential constructi on loans also rose. 
On the other hand, delinquencies on existing properties held by commercial banks and insurance companies have remained low, a nd CMBS delinquency rates have drifted only 
modestly higher, largely because of  loans on multifamily properties.  
Household Finance  
The deterioration in the performance of resi dential loans has continued, as delinquencies 
on nonprime and prime loans rose further in Ap ril.  Meanwhile, in the first quarter, the 
growth of residential mortgage debt continued to slow, and house pric es kept falling, as 
the purchase-only index calculated by the Offi ce of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
posted a record decline of 6.7 percent at  a seasonally adjusted annual rate. 
Conditions in the conforming-mortgage market  have not improved since the April FOMC 
meeting.  Spreads between primary-market interest rates on conforming mortgages and 
10-year Treasury securities rates were li ttle changed on net.  And although agency 
issuance of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) was again strong, issuance of private-label residential mortgage-backed securities was anemic.  The market for new conforming 
jumbo loans has been slow to take off, w ith only about $300 million in loans originated 
to date.  Moreover, the secondary market  for agency MBS was volatile, and option-
adjusted spreads widened on net.  CDS inde xes on the government-sponsored enterprises, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, moved up sli ghtly over the interm eeting period, although 
they remain well below recent highs.

 Delinquency rates on most types of consumer lo ans moved up further, particularly those 
on credit cards, and now stand close to thei r respective averages over the past decade.  
Interest rates on consumer loans (not shown) declined somewhat, as they continued their 
typically gradual adjustment to this year’s dr op in short-term rates.  Growth of consumer 
credit in April remained about in line with its average over recent years, despite the 
notably tighter terms and standa rds that banks have reported.  Issuance of most types of 
consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) was strong in May, led by a surge in auto loan 
ABS issuance, and has continued apace in th e first two weeks of June.  Spreads on 
consumer ABS have also started to narrow.  Reportedly, policy actions by the Congress 
and the Department of Education aimed at increasing the availability of funds for student lenders have helped to assuage concerns a bout student loan availability for the 2008-09 
school year. 
Long-term mutual funds registered strong inflows in April and May.  Domestic equity 
funds received inflows after several quarters of  sizable outflows, and international equity 
funds experienced renewed inflows as we ll.  Municipal bond funds also saw strong 
demand.  The large outflow in money market mutual funds in April and the subsequent 
rebound in May largely reflected seasonal tax-related patterns. 
Treasury Finance 
The Treasury’s midquarter refunding announcem ent was broadly in line with market 
expectations.  After a seven-year hiatus, the Treasury announced that it was reintroducing 
auctions of 52-week bills to help finance a sharply wider deficit.  The first auction of this security was well received, with a stop-out ra te slightly below expectations and a high 
bid-to-cover ratio.  The Treasury auctioned several other nominal securities over the 
intermeeting period, with maturities spanning 2 to 30 years; these auc tions were generally 
well received, with bid-to-cover ratios within historical ra nges.  Indirect bidding and 
allotments to foreign participants at thes e auctions continued their modest downward 
trend of recent months.  However, foreign offi cial holdings of U.S. Treasury securities at 
the Federal Reserve have risen briskly over the same period.   
Functioning in the Treasury coupon market improved somewhat over the intermeeting 
period, and on most days, bid-as ked spreads for on-the-run secu rities stayed near the low 
end of their range since last August.  De spite improved functioning overall, estimated 
yield curves continue to show  large fitting errors, the on-th e-run premium for the 10-year 
note remains close to its peak in early May, and the on-the-run premium for the 2-year

1 The April drop in securities is largely accounted fo r by the decision of a U.S. branch of a foreign 
bank to shift some securities holdings to a foreign offi ce.  Adjusting to remove the effects of this shift, 
securities holdings would have been about flat in April. note climbed noticeably for the first time since the recent financial turmoil began, 
suggesting that investors still have str ong demand for relatively liquid securities. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds continued to be robust in May, reflecting 
further restructuring by muni cipalities out of the now-esse ntially-defunct auction-rate 
security market as well as a general impr ovement in market conditions.  A substantial 
share of new capital issuance was for infrastr ucture projects.  Short-term issuance was 
moderate, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. 
The underlying credit quality of municipal bonds remained strong, and the number of 
ratings upgrades outpaced the number of downgrades in May.  Although the downgrade 
of two large municipal bond in surers in early June tri ggered a slew of automatic 
downgrades to municipal bonds this month, th ese actions were not surprising and had 
little effect on the market.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds declined a bit over the 
intermeeting period, and the ratio of such yields to those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities declined sharply, return ing to levels that prevailed prior to the 
financial turmoil.   
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at a sluggish 1¾ percent annual rate in the April and May period, with 
growth pulled down both by an unwinding of safe-haven flows associated with the 
financial turmoil in prior months and becau se of large final individual income tax 
payments.  These effects were partially offs et by deposits of economic stimulus payments 
and a continued decline in the opportunity cost  of holding money.  Li quid deposits rose at 
a 6 percent annual rate in Ap ril and May, while retail money market mutual funds slowed 
in April and contracted sharply in May.  Sma ll time deposits fell for the third consecutive 
month, and the currency component of M2, which has been somewhat volatile, was about 
flat, on net, over the two months.  
Commercial bank credit decreased modestly over the April-May pe riod, largely because 
of a runoff in banks’ holdings of securities a nd a drop in the volatile “other loan” series.

That said, C&I lending slowed appreciably, expa nding at only about ha lf its first-quarter 
pace.  Data from the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in early May

 indicate that, after ad justing for nonprice loan characteris tics, the average spread on C&I 
loans smaller than $25 million was slightly be low that reported in the February survey 
and was near the low end of their recent range.  In contrast, sp reads on commercial 
banks’ portions of syndicated loans remained at elevated levels in May.  Commercial real 
estate loans held by banks rose moderately  in April and May.  On the household side, 
residential mortgage loans fell, on net, over the past two months, wh ereas revolving home 
equity lines of credit continued to expand briskly, as bo rrowers reported ly drew down 
loans under existing low-cost credit lines.  Th rough May, originations of consumer loans 
have remained fairly strong. 
According to first-quarter Call Report data, commercial bank profitability—as measured 
by the return on assets—was adversely affected again by asset write-downs and elevated rates of loan-loss provisioning.  Without the boos t from the proceeds of the initial public 
offering of Visa Inc., which occurred in mid-March, results at many large commercial 
banks would have been worse.  Asset quality in nearly all major loan categories deteriorated further in the first quarter of 2008, with de linquency rates on residential 
mortgages as well as construction and land development loans registering very large increases.  All told, the deli nquency rate on all loans and leas es reached a level not seen 
since the early 1990s.

 IV-1 U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $60.9 billion in April after narrowing to 
$56.5 billion in March.  The widening of the deficit in April occurred as a jump in 
exports
 was outweighed by an even greater rise in imports. 
 
 
 
 In April,the value of exports of goods and services jumped 3.3 percent, following a 
1.9 percent decline in March.  The increase in April occurred across a number of 
catagories, with exports of industrial supplies and capital goods exhibiting particular 
strength.  Exports of consumer goods and automotive products also increased strongly.  
The decline in exports in March was also broadly based, although exports of aircraft and 
automotive products recorded particularly sharp drops.  Exports of services increased in 
both months.     
IV-2 
 
IV-3 
 
 
 
IV-4 
The value of imports of goods and services rose 4.5 percent in April, after falling 
3.3 pe
rcent in March.  Most catagories of goods recorded declines in March and increases 
in Apr
il.  The value of petroleum imports fell sharply in March before rebounding 
strongly in April, largely reflecting higher oil prices.  Imports of non-oil industrial 
supplies, c
apital goods, and automotive products also jumped up in April.  In contrast, 
imports of 
consumer goods rose only modestly in April following a sharp decline in 
Marc
h.  Imports of services rose at a moderate pace in both months.  
    
  Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In April, prices of core imports rose 1.5 percent, the largest one-month 
incr
ease in the 13-year history of the index.  This increase mostly reflected higher prices 
for material-intensive goods, which rose 2.8 percent in April.   Import prices for finished 
goods a lso contributed to April’s increase , rising 0.8 percent, due mainly to higher prices 
for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors).  In May, core import prices 
increased at a more moderate but still strong pace of 0.6 percent, as prices for both 
finished g
oods and material-intensive goods increased at slower rates.   
The average level of core import prices in April and May was almost 12 percent at an 
annual rate (a.r.) above the first-quarter average.  Prices for material-intensive goods 
were up 27 percent, whereas prices for finished goods increased 5¼ percent.  The 
second-quarter rise in prices for finished goods is the largest increase in this category 
since the fourth quarter of 1990 and is well above the 2007 pace of 2 percent.   
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 5.9 percent in April before climbing an 
additional 7.8 percent in May.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude 
oil averaged $112.33 per barrel in April, up 7 percent from its March average, and then 
spiked an additional 12 percent to an average of $125.39 per barrel in May.  The spot 
price of WTI has continued to climb higher thus far this month and closed at $134.01 per 
barr
el on June 17.  The price of futures for delivery at the end of 2016, which was at 
$137.05 per barrel on June 17, rose even more rapidly during the inter meeting period. 
IV-5 
 
 
IV-6 
 
IV-7 
The sharp upward movement in prices over this period appears to reflect  increasing 
concerns regarding supply, amid continuing strong demand from emerging markets, 
particularly China.  U.S. inventories for crude oil have fallen notably in recent weeks.  In 
addit
ion, both the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the International Energy 
Agency revised down their respective estimates of non-OPEC supply growth, adding to 
the gro
wing sense of pessimism regarding longer term supply prospects.  
 
E
xports.  Core export prices rose 0.5 percent in both April and May.  In April, prices for 
finished goods 
and for material-intensive goods increased at roughly the same rate.  In 
contrast, in May prices for finished goods rose only 0.2 percent, whereas prices for 
material-intensive goods rose 0.9 percent.  In April, falling wheat and soybean prices 
pulled down prices of agricultural exports 2.2 percent.  Although wheat prices continued 
to fall
 in May, higher prices for soybeans, vegetables, and meat resulted in a 0.3 percent 
increase in agricultural export prices for the month.   
 
The
 average level of core export prices in April and May was 8¼ percent (at an annual 
rate) above the first-quarter average.  Much of the rise can be attributed to the 22 percent 
increase in prices of nonagricultural industrial supplies.  Agricultural prices, having 
increased at a 58 percent pace in the first quarter, were up only 10 percent in the April-
Ma
y period.  Prices of exported finished goods were up nearly 3 percent, a rate 
comparable to that in 2007. 
 
U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $ 706 billion (a.r.) in the first quarter of 200 8, 
$37 billion wider than in the fourth quarter of 2007 (revised).  The widening resulted 
pr
imarily from a narrowing of the surplus in net investment income, as declines in 
income receipts on U.S. portfolio and direct investment abroad more than offset a decline 
in paymen ts on foreign portfolio investment in the United States.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Financial flows for the first quarter of 2008 show relatively modest net purchases of U.S. 
securities by private foreign investors (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Financial Transactions table; see also the chart on Private Securities Flows).  As has been 
the case since the financial turmoil began last summer, “flight to safety” considerations 
contributed to very strong net purchases of Treasury securities for the quarter (line 4a); 
foreign private demand for corporate stocks was weak (line 4d) and private investors on 
net sold agency and corporate bonds (lines 4b and 4c).  The net sales of corporate bonds 
in the first quarter were larger than in the third quarter of last year and are only the 
second such recorded quarterly outflow in these securities in more than 20 years.  In part, 
these net sales likely reflect weak net issuance of U.S. debt securities early this year.  
U.S. investors made moderate acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5).  Flows of U.S. 
direct investment abroad (line 6) eased a bit in the first quarter, primarily from a 
slowdown in reinvested earnings abroad.  Foreign direct investment into the United 
States (line 7) also slowed, primarily reflecting a shift from an increase to a decrease in 
net intercompany debt.   
IV-9 
 
Taken together, total private financial flows swung from a net inflow of $92 billion in the 
fourth quarter to a net outflow of $52 billion in the first quart er.  However, foreign 
official inflows (line 1) picked up further from their elevated rate in the fourth quarter, 
reflecting strong purchases of both Treasury and agency securities by Asian central banks 
as well as further acquisitions of corporate debt and stocks by some sovereign wealth 
funds.  In large part reflecting the swing in net private flows, the statistical discrepancy in 
the first quarter also swung to a sizable positive $53 billion, indicating some combination 
of over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial 
inflows.  
 
   
 
 The most recent data on securities transactions show that foreign private purchases of 
U.S. securities picked up a bit in April from the pace recorded in the first quarter, but this 
strength was again concentrated in Treasury securities.  Foreign private investors on net 
sold agency bonds and corporate stocks, but made small net purchases of corporate 
bonds.     
Foreign official flows into the United States remained quite strong in April,  
.  
Inflows from OPEC countries were weak in April following a pickup late last year and in 
January reflecting the high-profile capital injections into several U.S. financial firms by 
Middle East OPEC sovereign wealth funds.  In general, data for the OPEC countries have 
been volatile and most likely understate actual inflows from these countries.  Partial and 
confidential data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate a slower pace of official 
inflows in May and early June.  
U.S. official assets (line 2) showed a $15 billion outflow in April, reflecting primarily an 
increase in the amounts drawn from the reciprocal swap arrangements with the European 
Central Bank and Swiss National Bank.  These swap arrangements were also the primary 
contribution to the $24 billion outflow for this line in the fourth quarter.  The increase in 
the swap arrangements in May will contribute to a further $26 billion outflow for that 
month.  
Ther e was a small net inflow in April from U.S. residents’ net acquisitions of foreign 
securities in April, as U.S. investors on net sold foreign bonds (line 5a) and made small 
net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b).   

IV-10 
The volatile banking sector (line 3) posted a further net 
outflow in Apr
il, following the very large net outflow 
recorded in March.  Since the turmoil began in August 
2007, net lending abroad by banks has increased with 
unusual consistency (see inset chart).  These outflows, 
pr
imarily from foreign-owned banks lending to European 
affiliates, likely reflect tensions in interbank funding 
markets and cumulate to a sizeable $280 billion between 
August 2007 and April 2008. 
   
     
 The
 balance of payments data released in June showed 
upward revisions to foreign net purchases of U.S. securities of about $100 billion for 
2006 a
nd nearly $200 billion for 2007, based primarily on newly-released results of the 
survey of foreign holdings of U.S. securities as of June 2007.  The survey indicated 
considerably larger holdings of U.S. corporate bonds than previously available data had 
suggested, in part reflecting an apparent under-reporting of foreign acquisitions of U.S. 
asset-backed securities.  Inflows from foreign direct investment in the United States were 
also revised up nearly $100 billion for 2006 and 2007 together.       
The
se increases in financial inflows were partly offset by significant revisions to financial 
outflows.  There were sizable revisions —amounting to about $180 billion for the period 
2004-2007—to U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities, based primarily on results of the 
newly-released survey of U.S. holdings of foreign securities as of December 2006, which 
found larger holdings of foreign securities than previously estimated.  There were also 
significant revisions to “other flows” reported in line 10 for 2006, reflecting previously 
unrecorded increases in claims of U.S. issuers of asset-backed commercial paper and 
medium term notes on their foreign parents.   
On ne
t, the revisions to financial flows were nearly offsetting for 2006 but resulted in 
much larger inflows for 2007.  Combined with the revisions that reduced the size of the 
current account deficit in both years, the statistical discrepancy was revised to 
-$47 billion in 2006 and -$41 billion in 2007, suggesting some combination of under -
reporting of the current account deficit or over -reporting of net financial inflows.  The 
revision to the discrepancy for 2007 was striking, as the previous release had shown a 
positive discrepancy o f $84 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets  
Credit markets were relatively stable over the period, but bond yields rose noticeably as 
inflationary pressures came into the foreground of central bank concerns.  
 
 
 Yields on sovereign benchmark bonds rose 20 to 50 basis points and sovereign yield 
c
urves flattened in all of the major economies.  Although the major foreign central banks 
kept policy rates on hold, expectations of future monetary tightening increased as 
policymakers signaled greater concern about inflation.  Sterling yields rose after the 
re
lease of April CPI data showed that inflation had increased to 3 percent, and Governor 
King was required to write a letter of explanation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as 
inflation rose further to 3.3 percent in the May CPI release.  Euro yields rose as headline 
inflation climbed to 3.6 percent and several ECB members indicated that the ECB was 
likely to raise rates soon.  Canadian yields jumped on June 10, when the Bank of Canada 
defied market expectations of a rate cut and chose instead to hold rates fixed.  The central 
banks of Brazil, Chile, China, Egypt, Hungary,  India, Indonesia, Israel, the Philippines, 
Russia, and Turkey all tightened policy over the intervening period in order to combat 
rising food and energy prices, and yields on local-currency bonds have risen 
commensurately.    
Conditions in domestic European interbank markets remain ed strained, but changed little 
since the April Greenbook.  Spreads between 1-month Libor and overnight index swap 
ra
tes jumped 9 basis points in euro and 4 basis points in sterling as the maturity date of 
those contracts crossed into July, indicating some pressure associated with the quarter 
end.  Securitization has picked up modestly, and a few deals to sell asset-backed 
securities (ABS) have received attention, although b anks may have also used some 
recently issued ABS as collateral with the ECB.   In spite of the fact that demand for term 
funding in euro and sterling appeared fairly stable, implied rates from foreign exchange 
and currency basis swaps indicate that demand for dollar funding from European 
financial institutions may have appreciably increased.  The decision to increase the size 
of the Federal Reserve’s swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National 
Bank has allowed those institutions to lend greater amounts of dollar funding to their 
banks, and demand at the auctions for those funds has been high, with larger bid- to-cover 
ratios than at the Federal Reserve’s T erm Auction Facility.   
A numbe
r of major European banks announced further write downs for the first quarter, 
and financial stocks helped lead overall European equity indexes down about 5½ percent 
since the last Greenbook.  Several banks announced rights issues in order to shore up

their capital positions, and in some cases they were forced to offer lower prices in order 
to place the new equity.  Some Japanese banks also reported write- downs, but Japan’s 
FSA estimated that the six largest banks have so far suffered losses totaling 
$9.1 bil
lion, much less than the losses of their U.S. and European counterparts.  Japanese 
bank stocks rose over the period and the overall Nikkei index climbed 6½ percent.  Other 
Asian equity indexes were generally down, led by the Shanghai composite, which fell 
10 pe
rcent, and the performance of the major Latin American indexes was mixed.   
 
The
 trade-weighted nominal value of the dollar has moved in a fairly tight range.  The 
major currencies index rose 2 percent on net and the broad index increased about  
1 percent.  The dollar tended to move with perceptions of monetary policy and the 
relative economic strength of the United States versus foreign economies.  Chairman 
Bernanke’s discuss ion of the dollar on June 3 and market part icipants’ growing 
perception that the FOMC might raise rates more quickly than they had expected 
prompted the dollar to appreciate late in the period.  Of note, the dollar has depreciated 
1½ percent against the renminbi since mid-May after having remained essentially 
unc
hanged against that currency for most of April.  The dollar generally appreciated 
against most other emerging Asian currencies.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Real GDP in the advanced foreign economies expanded moderately in the first quarter, 
but the pace of economic activity varied markedly across economies.  In the euro area 
and Japan, strong investment contributed to a sharp acceleration in output.  In Canada, 
GDP contracted 0.3 percent on the back of large negative contribution from exports and 
inventories.  In the United Kingdom, output moderated to 1.6 percent due to a slowdown 
in r
eal estate and business activities.  Recent data point to softness across the advanced 
foreign economies in the second quarter.  Consumer and business confidence indicators 
have weakened in all major economies, and the PMIs show increased pessimism 
regarding the pace of business activity going forward.  Measures of the unemployment 
rate have started to drift up from decade lows in most economies. 
 
 
 I
nflationary pressures remain elevated on balance because of recent food and energy 
price increases.  In Europe, the prospect of inflation climbing to nearly 4 percent over the 
summ
er has led market participants to speculate that the European Central Bank and the 
Bank of England may increase interest rates this year.  The Bank of Canada held rates 
unchanged at its June meeting despite expectations of a cut, citing the possibility that CPI 
inflation would rise above 3 percent later in the year if current levels of energy prices 
pe
rsisted.  In Japan, headline inflation slid to 0.8 percent in April but interest rate 
expectations rose marginally over the intermeeting period. 
In Canada , real GDP contracted 0.3  percent (a.r.) in the first quarter.  Cutbacks were 
widespread in manufacturing, most notably in the automobile sector where production 
was hampered by a strike at a major supplier of automotive parts in the United States.  
Coming on the heels of rapid growth in the second half of 2007, inventory accumulation 
and business investment, especially in machinery and equipment, both eased markedly.  
Nevertheless, consumer spending advanc ed 3.2 percent, although this was the slowest 
quarterly rise in consumption in over two years.  Imports fell twice as much as exports; 
however, excluding autos, exports advanced 3 percent. 
I
ndicators suggest that GDP will avoid shrinking for a second consecutive quarter, 
although activity is likely to remain weak.  Housing starts in April and May, while 
healthy, were below their very strong first-quarter average.  The manufacturing sector 
rebounded in April, with widespread gains in the volume of sales.  However, the volume 
IV-22 
 
IV-23 
of new orders was down, with decreased orders for durables outweighing a rise in orders 
for nondurables.  Total employment continued to expand in both April and May, but 
more slowl
y than it did in the first quarter.  The unemployment rate held steady at 
6.1 percent in May, still near its 33-year low of 5.8 percent reached in February.  
 
 
 
 
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 1.7 percent in April, up from 
Mar
ch’s 1.4  percent, as disinflationary pressures stemming from the Canadian dollar’s 
appreciation seem to have subsided a bit.  At 1 percent in April, food price inflation 
remains low, although the rise in food prices between March and April was significantly 
faster than in the previous several months.  The Bank of Canada’s preferred measure of 
core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components of the consumer price 
index as well as the effects of indirect taxes, was 1.5 percent in April. 
IV-24 
 
 
 
IV-25 
In the euro area , real GDP grew 3.2 percent in the first quarter, with better-than-
ex
pected performance in domestic demand and net exports.  GDP growth was supported 
prim
arily by a 6.3 percent increase in German GDP, where construction activity was 
enha
nced by unusually warm weather.  Investment remained solid for the euro-area as a 
whole, but consumption continued to show signs of weakness, registering a second 
consecutive quarter of anemic growth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Recent data point to a moderation in economic activity in the current quarter, on balance.  
Business and consumer confidence indicators continued to deteriorate, and the volume of 
retail sale
s declined in March and April.  The PMI for manufacturing and the flash PMI 
for services remained only slightly above 50.  Nevertheless, IP rebounded in April and 
the unemployment rate held at 7.1 percent in April for the third consecutive month. 
IV-26 
 
 
IV-27 
The ECB’s survey of euro -area bank lending indicated a further tightening of credit 
standards in the first quarter.  The percent balance of euro-area banks reporting a net 
tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises was 49 percent in the first quarter, 
up from 41 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Banks also reported a further increase 
in the net tightening of credit standards for loans to households. 
 
 
 Eur
o-area twelve-month HICP inflation jumped to 3.7 percent in May, a record high 
since the start of euro-area statistics in 1997.  Inflation excluding energy and unprocessed 
food prices continued to meander around 2½ percent.  During the June meeting, the ECB 
Council left policy rates unchanged, but officials have signaled the possibility of a rate 
increase as early as July. 
In Japan , real GDP increased 4 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter.  Consumption and net 
exports both made unusually large contributions to growth (1.8 and 2. 0 percentage points, 
respectively).  Private investment rose a robust 3.2 percent after falling a cumulative 
4 percent over the previous three quarters. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV-28 
 
IV-29 
Recent indicators of production have been weak, however.  Industrial production 
contracted 3.4 percent in March and a further 0.2  percent in April, leaving the April level 
well below the first-quarter average.  April shipments data also fell short of their first-
quarter average.  Consistent with the weakening production numbers, export growth has 
slowed considerably since the beginning of the year; the 12-month growth rate of exports 
declined from 6 percent in January to 0.3 percent in April. 
 
 
 
 Although the labor market remains relatively strong overall, there are some signs of 
weakening.  The unemployment rate rose to 4 percent in April, and the job openings- to-
applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of 
officially registered job seekers) fell to 0.93, its lowest level since March 2005.  Total 
cash earnings (which include bonuses) grew a meager 0.9  percent over the twelve months 
ending in April. 
The nationwide core consumer price index (excluding fresh food only) rose 0.9 percent in 
April from a year earlier, compared with 1.2  percent in March.  Consumer prices 
excluding food and energy fell 0.1 percent.  The timelier core CPI for Tokyo rose 
0.9 percent in May from a year earlier. 
In the United Kingdom , real GDP moderated to 1.6 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, 
despite a sizeable increase in consumption.  Fixed investment contracted sharply after 
two quarters of solid growth, and inventories made a large negative contribution.  Net 
exports made a positive contribution as imports fell and exports moved sideways.  The 
service sector expanded 2 percent, its slowest pace since 2001, as real estate and business 
activities stalled. 
IV-30 
 
 
 
 
 Business and confidence indicators softened markedly through May.  The May PMIs for 
services and manufacturing indicated equal proportions of respondents expecting 
business activity in their sector to either expand or contract.  The Labor Force Survey 
mea
sure of the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.3 percent in March, and the number of 
people c
laiming unemployment benefits rose marginally in May, although the claimant 
count rate was unchanged. 
The housing market continues to be a major source of uncertainty for households.  Net 
nominal mortgage lending in April stood 30  percent below its 2007 average, while the 
value of mortgages approved for house purchases nearly halved over the same period, 
indicating that financial institutions are considerably limiting the origination of new 
loans.  The volume of remortgaging activities, on the other hand, continues to grow at a 
sustained pace. 
The twelve-month rate of CPI inflation climbed to 3.3 percent in May, prompting the 
Gove
rnor of the Bank of England to write a public letter to the Chancellor.  Energy and 
food prices, the largest contributors to the current run-up in headline inflation, rose 
15.6 and 7.8 percent, respectively, in the year to May.  The price of manufactured inputs 
soared nearly 30 percent over that period, its largest increase since 1976.  By contrast, 
average earnings including bonuses grew 3.2 percent in the twelve months to April, their 
slowest pace in five years. 
IV-31 
 
 
 
IV-32 
Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Recent indicators for emerging market economies generally point toward continued solid 
g
rowth, albeit at a slower pace than last year.  Strong exports among the emerging market 
e
conomies appear to have partially offset weakness in exports to the advanced 
ec
onomies.  Domestic demand remains robust in many of the countries.  Headline 
inflation rose further in most of the developing world, largely owing to higher food and 
e
nergy prices; several countries are facing upward pressure on core inflation as well.  The 
rising
 cost of energy subsidies has led several Asian countries to raise state-controlled 
fuel prices.  Since the April Greenbook, authorities in several countries, including Brazil, 
C
hina, India, and Turkey have tightened monetary conditions. 
 
 
 In China , data revisions led the staff to increase its estimate of real GDP growth in the 
fir
st quarter to a surprisingly strong 11.7 percent (s.a.a.r.).  Data on retail sales, up 
22 percent in April and May from a year earlier, suggest that domestic demand has 
c
ontinued to strengthen.  In addition, the trade surplus declined a bit in April and May, on 
average, from the first quarter, as imports jumped higher.  Since the fourth quarter of last 
year, growth of exports to the United States, Europe, and the rest of Asia has slowed.  
Ex
ports to Latin America have picked up ; however, Latin America accounts for less than 
5 pe
rcent of Chinese exports. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation was 8.5 percent in April, but fell to 7.7 percent in 
Ma
y, as food price inflation moderated from 22 percent to 20 percent.  To combat 
inflation, Chinese authorities have lowered import tariffs on selected foods, medicine, 
and cotton.  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) raised the required reserve ratio (RRR) 
for banks ½ percentage point in May and another 1 percentage point in June.  The latest 
increase brings the RRR to 17½ percent for large banks.  Bank lending ha s  been subdued 
over the past three months, with the twelve-month growth in loans less than 15 percent, 
the slowe
st pace of growth since early 2006.  The rate of renminbi appreciation slowed in 
Apr
il and the first half of May, but picked up again in the second half of the month.  The 
PBOC continues to accumulate international reserves at a rapid pace; reserves increased 
$75 billion in April to reach $1.75 trillion. 
On Ma
y 12, a massive earthquake struck the Sichuan province in China.  It is estimated 
that 90,000 people were killed and more than 350,000 people were injured.  The impact 
of this tragedy on the Chinese economy is not reflected in the data received to date, but 
ove
r the next few months there is likely to be some additional upward pressure on prices 
as distribution remains hampered and the supply of some agricultural products are 
IV-33 
diminished.  In addition, over the next few quarters, reconstruction is likely to provide a 
small boost to GDP. 
 
 
 
 
India’s GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year was revised up from 2.7 percent 
(s.a.a.r) to 7.6 percent, in part due to bountiful rains in the monsoon season that resulted 
in higher agricultural production than initially estimated.  Growth strengthened further in 
the first quarter of this year to 9.1 percent, the agriculture and services sectors were 
particula
rly strong but industrial production slowed.  The trade deficit widened in the first 
quarte
r and in April, as imports grew faster than exports.  Inflation, measured by both 
consum
er and wholesale prices, remained relatively constant in March and April, but 
some prices, particularly of metals and oil seeds, accelerated.  In addition, in early June, 
the gov
ernment increased retail gasoline prices 11 percent and diesel prices 9.5 percent.  
Amid inf
lationary pressures, the central bank raised the repo rate 25 basis points to 
8 percent on June 11,  more than a month before the bank's next scheduled policy meeting 
and it
s first hike in14 months.  The central bank also raised the reserve requirement 
25 ba
sis points to 8.25 percent and relaxed restrictions on capital inflows by raising 
for
eign investment limits; greater capital inflows may help reduce downward pressures 
on the rupee.

In the  NIEs1, first-quarter GDP growth picked up in Hong Kong and Singapore but 
slowed in Kor
ea and Taiwan.  Real GDP in Hong Kong was buoyed by strong Chinese 
growth.  In Singapore, growth surged to 14½ percent (s.a.a.r.) following a marked 
contra
ction in the fourth quarter, as activity in the biomedical sector rebounded sharply.  
In Korea and Taiwan, the slowdowns were broad-based.  More recently, industrial 
produc
tion growth for April was unchanged in Korea and plunged in Singapore, 
refle
cting a contraction in the biomedical sector.  Trade surpluses in Korea, Singapore, 
and Taiwan have widened thus far in the current quarter from the first-quarter average; 
Hong Kong’s trade def icit has narrowed. 
 
 Twe
lve-month consumer price inflation remained elevated in the NIEs, largely reflecting 
higher food and energy prices, although there have been some upward moves in core 
infla
tion as well.  Specifically, Hong Kong and Singapore experienced large increases in 
inflation in April, and Korea saw a large increase in May.  To respond to the adverse 
effects of inflation on the poor, the Korean government announced a $10 billion relief 
package for its lowest-income citizens over the next year.  In contrast, inflation in Taiwan 
edged lower in April and May.  Taiwanese authorities announced a large increase in fuel 
prices in late May.

Data from the ASEAN-4  show signs of a mild weakening in economic growth.  With the 
ex
ception of Indonesia, real GDP  growth slowed in the first quarter.  Final domestic 
demand was strong in both Malaysia and Indonesia, but there was a substantial 
dr
awdown in inventories.  Domestic demand remained solid in the Philippines, boosted 
by
 strong remittances.  In Thailand, domestic demand was weak in the first quarter, but 
industrial pr
oduction rebounded in April. 
 
 
 Tha
iland, the world’s largest exporter of rice, has benefited from recent record high 
prices for the commodity.  Nevertheless, the trade balance for Thailand has deteriorated 
as exports have failed to keep pace with imports.  The Philippines has been hit hard by 
the r
unup in the world prices of both rice and crude oil, which have sharply increased its 
import bill. 
Across the region, increasing food and energy prices continue to push consumer price 
inflation higher.  Both the Indonesian and Malaysian governments recently raised the 
domestic price of fuel, which is state-controlled.  Malaysia has announced plans to 
eliminate fuel subsidies altogether in August of this year, while Indonesia has opted to 
begin a system of rationing in September.  Thailand instituted a small subsidy on diesel 
fuel for buses, and the Philippines eliminated its 1 percent import tariff on crude oil.  The 
central banks of Indonesia and the Philippines have raised rates to combat inflation.

Mexican  real GDP growth decreased to 2.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, reflecting 
in part the slowdown in the United States.  Mining, construction, and the manufacture of 
texti
les and computer equipment decelerated, and the volatile agricultural sector posted a 
dec
line of 7 percent.  Data for the current quarter point to continued lackluster 
perf
ormance.  Industrial production declined 1.8 percent in April, with a particularly 
large decline in the mining sector, which includes oil and gas extraction.  Indexes of 
consumer confidence declined in April and May, while the manufacturing opinion survey 
has moved sideways since January.  The trade deficit continued to widen in April, 
reflecting a broad-based jump in imports and a decline in exports.  Headline inflation in 
May
 reached 5 percent on a twelve-month basis, pushing inflation further away from the 
4 percent upper bound of the central bank’s target range.  
 
 
 
In Brazil , first-quarter real GDP growth slowed to 2.9 percent from 6.6 percent in the 
fourth quarter.  On the production side, the weakness was mainly in the agricultural 
sector.  On the expenditure side, private consumption growth dropped to 1.3 percent, and 
investme
nt moved down from double-digit rates last year to 5.4 percent.  The trade 
surplus narr
owed in the first quarter but rebounded significantly in May as exports 
soared, following the end of a customs strike.  In April, both auto production and 
domestic sales were very strong, and capacity utilization rates remained high.  However, 
industrial output was up only slightly.  Headline inflation continued to move up, reaching 
IV-43 
5.5 percent in May.  Both food prices and prices of core goods have been putting upward 
pre
ssure on headline inflation.  The regulated price category, which includes energy, has 
risen onl
y modestly in recent months. 
 
 
 I
n early June, as expected, the central bank raised its target policy rate 50 basis points to 
12¼ percent, following a similar move in April.  The government also announced that it 
would raise its target for the primary fiscal surplus to 4¼ percent of GDP from 
3¾ percent of GDP.  The move was primarily aimed at allaying concerns about rapid 
growth of government spending.  Brazil ’s sovereign credit rating was raised to 
investment grade by S&P in April and by Fitch in May. 
 
In Argentina , growth of nominal exports and imports jumped in April, with exports 
supported b
y high prices for agricultural commodities.  In March, the government 
decided to increase export taxes on several agricultural products, including soybeans, 
gr
ains, and oilseeds, in an attempt to reduce food price inflation, triggering a strike by 
farmers.  The confrontation between the government and farmers spilled over into other 
sectors in recent weeks, when truckers began blocking roads, leading to some food 
shortages.  The tensions contributed to a decline in bank deposits and downward 
pre
ssures on the peso, prompting the central bank to engage in unsterilized intervention to 
support the currency, which put upward pressures on interest rates.  On June 9, the 
thirty-day bank deposit rate was 12.7 percent, up from about 8 percent in early May.   
Hea
dline consumer price inflation reached nearly 9 percent in April on a twelve-month 
IV-44 
basis, amid large increases in prices of services, such as housing, transportation and 
health.  Despite the introduction of a new CPI index, skepticism about the reliability of 
the official inflation data continues. 
 
 
 
 
In Venezuela, real GDP plunged by an estimated 9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter on 
sharp c
ontractions in manufacturing and construction.  Consumer price inflation 
continued to climb in May, reaching 30 percent on a twelve-month basis.  Food prices 
wer
e up 45 percent as a result of the relaxation of price controls.  The black-market 
ex
change rate is currently 3,400 bolivar per dollar, versus an official rate of 2,100.  
Financ
e Minister Rafael Isea resigned in mid-June to run in the forthcoming elections in 
November
, but policies are expected to remain expansionary under his successor, Ali 
Rodriguez, the current ambassador to Cuba and former president of state-oil company 
PDVSA.

In Turkey, real GDP increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by st rong private 
se
ctor investment.  Industrial production has shown signs of moderation in recent months.  
Twelve
-month consumer price inflation reached 10.7 percent in May, significantly higher 
than the 6 percent upper limit of the central ban k’ s year -end target.  The Monetary Policy 
Committee raised its policy rates 50 basis points at its May meeting, in light of 
inflationary pressures resulting from lagged pass-through from exchange rates and rising 
prices for energy and processed foods.  In early June, th e  central bank raised its medium-
term inflation targets to 7.5 percent in 2009, 6.5 percent in 2010, and 5.5 percent in 2011.  
Twelve-month-ahead inflation expectations increased to 8.6 percent in the mid-June 
Survey of Expectations.
