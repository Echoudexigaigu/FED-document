1 Since the June Greenbook, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 was passed.  Legislation 
included in the act provides extended unemployment insurance benefits for unemployed individuals who 
filed a claim for state benefits on May 7, 2007, or later; have exhausted their regular benefits; and meet earnings and work requirements.  Individuals could start filing for extended bene fits during the week of 
July 6, 2008; the Employment and Training Administration will begin to report claims for extended benefits in August. Aggregate economic activity held up reasonably we ll in the first half of  the year despite a 
weakening labor market, adverse financial c onditions for households and businesses, and 
the continued rapid descent in residential construction.  Alth ough sales of motor vehicles 
stepped down sharply over the course of th e spring, consumer spending on other goods 
was surprisingly well maintained until seeming to  falter in June.  Similarly, investment in 
business equipment excluding transportation s till appeared to be rising modestly.  
Nonresidential construction activity has not  tapered off yet even though vacancy rates 
have risen and credit conditions have tightene d.  Industrial production (IP) declined in the 
second quarter after litt le change over the previous two quarters, but the decline was not 
as sharp as in a typical recession.  At the same time, core consumer price inflation has 
remained relatively stable in recent months, while headline inflati on has been elevated, 
reflecting large increases in prices of food and energy. 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor demand continued to contract in the s econd quarter.  Private payroll employment 
fell 91,000 in June, and the level of employ ment in May was revised down by about 
75,000.  Losses now average 91,000 over the three months ending in June, close to the 
first quarter’s average monthly declin e of 97,000.  In the household survey, the 
unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent in June.  Unemployment rates for those aged 
16 to 24 partly retraced their jump in Ma y, but this decrease was offset by a further 
increase in the unemployment rate among thos e aged 25 and older.  The June reading on 
the unemployment rate brought the second-qua rter average to 5.3 percent, up from 
4.9 percent in the first quarter.   Another measure of slack, th e fraction of workers who are 
working part time for economic reasons, has continued to rise. 
Other indicators point toward continued w eakness in the labor market.  The level of 
insured unemployment has continued to move up, and the number of individuals 
unemployed due to job loss has risen furthe r as a percentage of the labor force.1  Most 
indicators of layoffs—including the short-te rm job losers rate and announcements of 
downsizing plans compiled by Challenger, Gray , and Christmas, Inc.—suggest that flows 
into unemployment remained elevated through June, and initial claims for unemployment insurance have drifted up a bit since then.

2 Although IP advanced 0.5 percent in June, output last month was boosted by a rebound in motor 
vehicle production and a jump in both mining and utilities output.  Manufacturing production excluding 
motor vehicles edged down 0.1 percent in June. Evidence on hiring also is gloomy.  The hires rate, as measured by the Job Openings and 
Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), moved down a bit further in May, while the JOLTS job 
openings rate held steady at a level ½ percen tage point below its year-earlier level.  
Moreover, the most recent readings on net hi ring plans from both the Manpower and the 
National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) surveys suggest further reductions 
in hiring in coming months.  Perceptions of  job availability in the Conference Board 
survey eroded a bit further in July.  The NF IB measure of hard-to-fill positions remained 
at a very low level in June. 
Households are very pessimistic about the outlook for the labor market.  Both the 
Reuters/University of Michigan and Conferen ce Board surveys remain near the lows of 
the early 1980s. 
We will receive the employment report fo r July two days after this Greenbook is 
published and will discuss that report in the Supplement to be distributed on August 1. 
Industrial Production  
IP remains weak.2  For the second quarter as a whole,  IP fell at an annual rate of 3.1 
percent after having been flat over the previous two quarters.  The decline in IP last 
quarter reflected weak domestic demand for industrial goods and a smaller boost from net 
trade than had been provided in the previ ous few quarters.  The factory operating rate 
held steady at 77.6 percent in June—about 2 percentage points belo w its long-run average 
but still more than 6 percenta ge points above its 2001-02 low. 
Motor vehicle assemblies tumbled more than 1 million units in the second quarter to an 
annual rate of 8.8 million.  The downshift in  production reflected both the effect of 
strikes, which restrained output at General Motors from March to May, and soft demand 
for full-size pickup trucks and s port-utility vehicles.  In June, with the end of the strikes, 
motor vehicle production rebounded to a still- subdued pace of 9.3 million units.  As for 
the third quarter, the domestic vehicle makers have substantially pared back their assembly plans from an initial rate of 10.5 million units to 9.6 million units. 
Vehicle inventories edged down, on balance, ov er the second quarter, but the drop-off in 
the pace of sales pushed up days’ supply to an  uncomfortably high 75 days at the end of 
June.  The recent shift in demand toward smaller,  more fuel-efficient vehicles is affecting

3 These models include the Ford Focus (produced in Michigan), the Honda Civic (produced in Ohio), 
and the Toyota Corolla (produced in Ohio).  In addition, inventories of Toyota’s popular Prius and Camry 
hybrid models, which are both produced in Japan, are extremely tight. 
4 Recent industry anecdotes suggest that financial stress in the air line industry has placed at risk 
roughly one-third of the unfilled orders at both Boeing and Airbus.  However, the current backlog of 
orders—more than seven years for both manufacturers at current production rates—suggests that even if 
cancellations were to soar, production would likely continue at high levels for several years. the composition of the inventory stock:  Days’ supply of light trucks rose sharply in the 
second quarter and stood at a very elevated 100 days at the end of J une, while supplies of 
autos remained relatively lean.  Capacity ut ilization rates for dome stic auto production 
have increased in recent months.  Indeed, production is running at or  near capacity for a 
few models of small cars.3  In contrast, the operating rate  at domestic plants producing 
light trucks has averaged a bout 55 percent since the spring. 
Elsewhere in transportation equipment, the outp ut of aircraft and pa rts picked up in June 
after having been little changed, on balance, since the end of 2007.  The first deliveries of 
Boeing’s fuel-efficient 787 are expected in the second quarter of 2009; given the lead 
times for assembling these aircraft, the output of  aircraft and parts wi ll need to continue 
to ramp up in the near term to meet the scheduled deliveries.4 
Production of high-tech equipmen t expanded at an annual rate of 20 percent in the second 
quarter after a similar-sized gain in the first quarter; these increases are relatively 
moderate by historical standards.  Se miconductor production rose at a solid clip 
throughout the first half of the year, as shar p increases in a few categories in the first 
quarter were followed by more broad-based increases in the second quarter.  Intel’s 
second-quarter revenues came in at the high end of their guidance and indicated robust 
demand for microprocessors and chipsets during the quarter.  Downstream from 
semiconductors, computer output decelerated in  the second quarter as increases in sales 
of both servers and personal computers were offset by a shift in demand toward lower-
value products.  The output of communicati ons equipment rose solidly in the second 
quarter after a lull in the first quarter. 
The available indicators of hi gh-tech manufacturing activity point to slower production in 
the current quarter.  The midpoi nt of Intel’s third-quarter guidance suggests a much more

5 Two counterpoints to the evidence of weakness in semiconductors—and indications that at least the 
bottom is not dropping out of the ma rket—are a recent upgrade of Gart ner’s semiconductor forecast and an 
“Apple effect” on flash memory due to strong demand for mobile devices. 
6 In addition, capital expenditures by major Internet portals, such as Google, Microsoft, and eBay, were 
down in the second quarter, and a recent statement by Cisco sugges ts that most communications equipment 
customers do not foresee a rebound in activity until early 2009. boards remained below 1 in June.5  For communications equipment, the annual guidance 
by telecommunications service providers sugges ts that capital expe nditures will decline 
over the remainder of the year; capital spe nding at AT&T and Verizon edged down in the 
second quarter.6  For computers, industry anecdotes project that produc tion is likely to 
continue to rise only moderately in the near  term.  In the most recent survey by the 
National Association for Business Economics, business plans for future spending on 
high-tech equipment edged down further in  the second quarter; although the diffusion 
index remains above 50, it is at a relatively low level by historical standards. 
Output excluding the production of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech 
products decreased at an annual rate of more than 3 percen t in the second quarter after 
having declined at a rate of about 2 percent in each of the two preceding quarters.  The 
index for business equipment fell more than  6 percent in the second quarter, as the 
production of industrial and other equipmen t—in particular farm machinery—dropped 
sharply.  The output of consumer goods decr eased for a third consecutive quarter, with 
declines in both durable and nondurable consumer goods. 
The output of construction supplies con tinued to fall in the second quarter, and 
production in June was about 9½ percent belo w its peak at the beginning of 2006.  The 
output of products associated wi th nonresidential constructio n, such as architectural and 
structural metals and constr uction steel, which previously  had partially offset the 
production losses related to residential invest ment, moved lower in the second quarter.  
The output of business supplies and materials also moved down. 
Indicators of near-term production generally point to further declines in manufacturing 
activity.  Despite an uptick in June, the th ree-month moving average of real adjusted 
durable goods orders has decreased, on balance,  since the start of the year.  The average 
of the new orders diffusion indexes from th e regional manufacturing surveys edged down 
to 46 in July after having fallen sharply in  June.  In contrast, the available weekly 
physical product data for July are on track to  contribute positively to IP, mainly because 
of higher output of motor vehicles, crude  oil, and refined petroleum products.

Motor Vehicle Sales  
Demand for light vehicles fell markedly in th e second quarter.  In June, sales plunged to 
an annual rate of 13.6 million units, the lowest level in 15 years, and sales for the quarter 
as a whole totaled only 14.1 million units.  In addition, industry analysts report that sales 
have remained depressed in July.  Most of the falloff in demand this year seems 
attributable to general factors such as inco me and employment.  In addition, the drop in 
June sales likely was a reaction to the sharp rise  in gasoline prices in recent months.  The 
percentage of Reuters/Michigan survey res pondents who cited high gaso line prices as the 
reason for their negative view of car-buying c onditions stood at near-record levels from 
May through July. 
Higher gasoline prices also appear to have accelerated the shift in motor vehicle sales 
toward small cars and cross-utility vehicles.  The limited availability of some smaller, 
more fuel-efficient vehicles may also have play ed a role in the drop in June sales.  The 
shift in demand has contributed to the c ontinued downward movement in the domestic 
market share of the Detroit Three automakers , which rely heavily on sales of full-size 
pickups and sport- utility vehicles. 
Consumer Spending  
The latest data on retail sales and consumer  prices suggest that real outlays for goods 
excluding motor vehicles (PCE control) dropped noticeably in June after three months of 
robust gains.  Smoothing through th e volatility over the first half  of this year, increases in 
real PCE control averaged 0.2 percent per m onth.  In contrast, real outlays for motor 
vehicles have declined sharply since the st art of the year.  Real spending on services 
posted a solid rise in May—the  latest month for which data  are available—with a boost 
from outlays for energy services and recreation.  Taken together, these pieces imply that 
real PCE rose moderately in the second quart er after posting a weak gain in the first 
quarter. 
The resilience of consumer spending so far this year contrasts with the continued 
weakening of its fundamentals.  The ratio of wealth to income declined in the fourth 
quarter of 2007 and the first quart er of this year, and househol d net worth has deteriorated 
further since then as equity prices have declined, on balance, and house prices have 
continued to fall.  Weakness in the labor market has restrained nominal gains in 
compensation even as the run-up in food a nd energy prices has crimped the purchasing 
power of a dollar.  Up to this point, househol ds have been able to tap existing credit lines 
and other assets to maintain their spending.  However, the most recent Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  indicates a substantial increase in

banks’ reluctance to extend cons umer credit (see the appendix to the “Domestic Financial 
Developments” section).  In addition, consumer sentiment—despite the small increase in 
July—remains at a depressed level. 
Fiscal stimulus, in contrast, is likely providing some s upport to consumer spending.  
Since the end of April, households have received  more than $90 billion in tax rebates.  In 
fact, tax rebates account for the entire 5.3 percent jump (at a m onthly rate) in real 
disposable income in May.  With only a few months of spending data available since the 
rebate distribution began and considerable uncertainty about the underlying strength of 
spending, the timing and the ultimate magnitude  of the response of households to the 
fiscal stimulus remain difficult to assess.  Th e available indicators provide mixed signals.  
Consumer surveys report that only a minority  of households expects to use the rebates 
mostly to increase their spe nding—strikingly similar to th e plans reported during the 
2001 tax rebates.  Yet some retailers are us ing special promotions in an attempt to 
encourage rebate spending, and they attribute some types of  purchases to tax rebates. 
Housing  
Residential construction activity  has continued to descend ra pidly this year, albeit at a 
somewhat slower pace than during the second ha lf of last year.  In June, single-family 
housing starts dropped to an annual rate of  647,000 units, and adjusted permit issuance—
a useful month-ahead indicator of starts—slid  to an annual rate of  630,000 units.  Both of 
these figures were about 15 percent below their December readings, compared with 
declines of about 30 percent in the preceding six-month period.  In the multifamily sector, 
housing starts jumped nearly 45 percent in June to an annual rate of 419,000 units—well 
above the range of readings seen over the past  two years.  Available information suggests 
that this increase can be traced to more-stringent building codes that took effect in New 
York City on July 1, which apparently led developers to move up some planned apartment projects. 
Even though cuts in new construction continue to trim the level of new-home inventories, 
the months’ supply of new homes remains severely bloated because of the ongoing 
reductions in demand for new houses.  The Cens us Bureau’s measure of sales agreements 
for new homes edged down to an annual ra te of 530,000 units in June, a decrease of 
12 percent from six months earlier after a dr op of 24 percent in the final six months of 
2007.

7 Recent anecdotes from builders also suggest that tightening standa rds for acquisition, development, 
and construction loans are putting downward pressure on housing production, even in markets that have not 
experienced appreciable declines in demand. 
8 Even before the mortgage-market turmoil, offer rates for prime jumbo loans were about ¼ percentage 
point above conforming rates, likely because the risk of prepayment is higher and because private-label mortgage-backed securities are less liquid. annual rate of 4.27 million units in June.  Thes e sales inched lower ove r the first half of 
this year following a 14 percen t drop in the second half of  2007.  Meanwhile, the measure 
of homebuying sentiment from Reuters/Mich igan and the NAHB index of homebuilder 
attitudes remain at levels consistent with a further deterioration in housing demand. 
Tight conditions in the mortgage credit ma rkets continue to restrain housing demand.7  
The deterioration has been  particularly acute for nonprime and nonconforming jumbo 
mortgages that cannot be purchased by gove rnment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs); new 
issuance of such loans has virtually halte d, and lending spreads remain very wide.  
Although recent legislation created a new cla ss of conforming loans with higher loan 
limits in high-priced cities, originations of  these new jumbo conforming loans have been 
very sluggish, and offer rates for these loans ar e still 25 to 50 basis points above those for 
standard conforming loans.8  Meanwhile, rates for standard 30-year fixed-rate 
conforming mortgages have risen about ¾ percentage point since mid-April to 
6.6 percent.  In addition, these mortgages have  become more difficult to obtain, as the 
GSEs have tightened lending standards and are charging higher gua rantee fees on loans 
to borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller down payments.  Moreover, down-
payment requirements have become a more binding restriction on ma ny potential buyers, 
because many private mortgage insurers ha ve raised their fees and adopted more-
stringent standards and because few lenders are willing to extend second mortgages that 
allow borrowers to sidestep these requirements. 
House prices remain on a downward trajector y.  The monthly version of the purchase-
only repeat-sales price inde x calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight (OFHEO) decreased at an annual rate of 6¾ percent over the three months 
ending in May.  By comparison, the 10-city vers ion of the Case-Shiller repeat-sales price 
index—which, unlike the OFHEO index, includes houses financed by nonconforming 
loans and is more heavily concentrated in ur ban areas that had seen a more substantial 
run-up of house prices— tumbled at an annual rate of almost 20 percent over the same period.   As for new homes, th e constant-quality price inde x—which attempts to control 
for changes in the quality and geographi c composition of new homes sold—was down 
3½ percent in the second quarter relative to its level four quarters earlier.  Though these

lower prices may eventually he lp bolster sales, survey evidence and anec dotal reports 
suggest that expectations of further house price declin es are quite prevalent, a 
consideration that may make potential buyers reluctant to purchase homes until prices 
show signs of stabilizing. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have been little changed in 
the second quarter, as a large decline in bus iness outlays for motor vehicles more than 
offset a modest gain in E&S excluding transportation.  Nont ransportation investment held 
up reasonably well through midyear  despite a subpar rate of in crease in business output 
and an apparent increase in the user cost of capital, reflecting higher borrowing rates and 
an acceleration in the rela tive price of capital goods. 
While monthly indicators of business sen timent—both national and regional—have 
edged back up over the past few months, they remain downbeat for the most part.  
Moreover, financial conditions have deterior ated further since the June Greenbook.  In 
particular, corporate bond yields have incr eased somewhat in recent weeks, leaving 
spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds ove r Treasury yields near their recent peaks 
in March.  In addition, according to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a large 
fraction of banks reported that they furt her tightened lending standards and terms on 
commercial and industrial loans. 
Business outlays on transportation equipmen t fell sharply in th e second quarter.  
Automakers continued to scale back deliverie s to daily rental companies; demand from 
other businesses weakened as well.  In June , sales of medium and heavy trucks edged 
down further from the already-weak pace obs erved in preceding months.  New orders 
also moved down, a sign that truck sales are un likely to improve in the near term.  Data 
on aircraft shipments through May suggest that domestic outlays in this category may 
have retreated a little in the second quarter. 
Spending on computers and software appears to ha ve risen at a moderate rate in the first 
half of the year.  The Bureau of Economic An alysis reported that software spending rose 
at a healthy pace in the first quarter, and Microsoft reported a strong increase in second-
quarter revenues.  Although nominal shipment s of computers and peripheral equipment 
from domestic producers declined at a more rapid pace in the second quarter, imports of such items jumped in May.  Investment in communications equipment has been soft recently, with shipments increasing only modestly and new orders declining in the second quarter.

Real spending on equipment other than high- tech and transportation looks to have 
improved a bit last quarter after having declin ed in the preceding two quarters.  Orders 
and shipments for this broad category of e quipment posted noticeable increases in the 
second quarter.  Orders for mining and oilfield machinery as well as for HVAC (heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning) equipment were particularly strong.  Moreover, the second-quarter increase in spending on capit al goods seems have been considerably 
greater than one would infer from domestic shipments alone, as imports of such items 
surged in April and May. 
Some—but not all—of the apparent increase in nomina l spending during the second 
quarter likely reflects large price increases  for these capital goods.  Prices have 
accelerated for both domestic and imported eq uipment:  The producer price index (PPI) 
for capital goods excluding hi gh-tech and transportation ro se at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent over the first half of 2008, up from 2½ percent in 2007.  Prices for imported 
capital goods excluding computers and semic onductors, which rose 3¼ percent last year, 
increased at annual rates of 4 percent in th e first quarter and 8½ percent in the second 
quarter. 
Nonresidential Construction  
Data through May continue to show a r obust increase in nonresi dential construction 
activity.  However, recent market fundamentals and forward-looking indicators for this 
sector have deteriorated.  Vacancy rates in the office and industrial sectors reversed 
course in the first quarter following several years of declines, and rates for retail space 
continued on an upward trajectory.  In the resale market, sales of existing commercial 
properties have plunged so far this year afte r 2007’s record pace, a nd prices are showing 
signs of softening.  On the financing side , issuance of commerci al mortgage-backed 
securities has fallen dramatically this y ear, corporate bond spreads remain wide, and 
recent (SLOOS) point to rapidly tightening standards for commercial real estate loans.  Costs are also surging:  The PPI for materials and components for construction rose at an annual rate of nearly 20 percent over the th ree months ending in June, and anecdotes 
from general contractors suggest that pri ce increases for key c onstruction inputs (like 
asphalt, steel, and plastic materials) are squeezing profit margins.  The negatives for nonresidential activity appear to be depressing plans for ne w projects; the three-month 
average of the architectural billings index ha s registered a string of  weak readings since 
February that are consistent with outright declines in nonresidential buildi ng outlays in 
the second half of this year.

9 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 authorized an expected total of about $115 billion in stimulus 
rebates, with $94 billion going out by the end of July, another $5 billion being disbursed over the remainder 
of calendar year 2008, and around $16 billion being distributed during the tax-filing season in 2009. 
10 The Administration's Mid-Session Review of the Budget (MSR), which was released on July 28, 
projects the deficit for fiscal 2008 to be $389 billion, narrower than the Administration’s estimate of 
$410 billion in February but wider than suggested by the trend for the deficit over the first nine months of 
the fiscal year.  Historically, the MSR has tended to be too pessimistic on the current-year deficit. In the drilling and mining sector, rising energy prices have been stimulating activity for 
some time now, though the quarterly pattern  has been uneven.  Recent readings for 
footage drilled and the number of drilling rigs  in operation suggest that activity resumed 
its upward climb in the second quarter after having paused early this year. 
Business Inventories 
The indicators we track con tinue to send mixed messages regarding whether firms are 
holding excess inventories.  On the one hand, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales 
(excluding motor vehicles) ticked down again in May and does not appear particularly 
elevated.  On the other hand, information from  the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system 
suggests that months’ supply of goods excludi ng motor vehicles and parts has moved up, 
on balance, since November 2007; the recent in crease is similar in magnitude to that 
witnessed during the 1995 inventory cycle and in the period before the 2001 recession.   
The details from the flow-of-goods system point  to some deteriorat ion in manufacturers’ 
inventory positions in areas such as equipment, construction supplies, and materials.   
Federal Government Sector  
The deficit in the unified federal budget dete riorated markedly in the second quarter as 
the rise in tax receipts slowed further, outlays increased briskl y, and the bulk of the 
stimulus rebates were mailed out.9  Adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial 
transactions, the unified budget su rplus recorded in the three tax-heavy months ending in 
June was $116 billion less than the adjusted surplus in the same period last year; the 
stimulus rebates accounted for about two-thir ds of this erosion.  Over the 12 months 
ending in June, the adjusted deficit was $349 billion, or approximately 2½ percent of 
nominal GDP.10 
Excluding the effects of stimulus rebates, tax receipts in the April to  June period posted a 
meager gain of 2 percent over their level in the comparable period last year.  The slowing 
in federal tax payments has been most pronounced in corporate tax receipts, probably 
reflecting the decline in corporate book profits relative to  a year ago.  Net corporate 
receipts in the second quarter—which incl uded firms’ first and second quarterly 
estimated payments on 2008 liab ilities—were 15 percen t below their level in the same

year-earlier period.  Individual income and payroll taxes, excluding stimulus rebates, 
posted a modest gain of 5 percent, down fr om more than 8¾ percent in the year-earlier 
period, likely consistent with the deceleration in personal income. 
Adjusted federal outlays in the second quart er rose 11¾ percent above the level in the 
year-earlier period.  Defense spending incr eased almost 12 percent over this period, 
which points to a robust increase in real defense purchases in the second quarter as 
measured in the national income and product accounts.  Transfer payments also moved 
up briskly relative to a year ago, boosted in part by the por tion of the stimulus rebates 
sent to households with little or no tax liabi lity; such rebates are counted as transfer 
payments in the budget. 
At the end of June, the Supplemental A ppropriations Act of 2008 was passed, providing 
$163 billion in funding for military activities in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  This funding is 
expected to be spent through the rest of 2008 and into the middle of 2009.  This 
legislation also included a temporary 13-week extension of unemployment insurance 
benefits to workers who have exhauste d their regular 26 weeks of unemployment 
benefits.  The extension is expected to provi de a total of about $12 billion in additional 
benefits to covered workers still unemployed in the sec ond half of 2008 and the first 
quarter of 2009. The Congress passed, and the President has signed, legislation making a number of 
changes to federal housing policy.  This legisl ation would provide temporary authority to 
the Treasury to purchase an uns pecified amount of debt and equity issued by Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks.  The Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) estimated that there is a greater than 50 percent chance that this Treasury authority 
will not be used before it expires at the end of December 2009.  Nonetheless, reflecting 
the large estimated expense in  the event the authority is  acted upon, the CBO put the 
expected cost of this authority to the fe deral budget at $25 billion, spread over fiscal 2009 
and 2010.  The other provisions in this legisl ation are estimated by the CBO to increase 
the federal deficit by around $20 billion thr ough fiscal 2010.  These provisions include a 
temporary program allowing the Federal Hous ing Administration to refinance mortgages 
that have been written down to 90 percent or less of their current assessed value, a 
temporary tax credit for first-time home buyers, and some additional funds for state 
governments to purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed and abandoned homes.

State and Local Government Sector 
Incoming data suggest that real purchases by state and local governments rose moderately 
in the second quarter.  Following a shar p drop-off in the first quarter, nominal 
construction spending rebounded in April and May, increasing at an annu al rate of about 
8 percent relative to the first-quarter average.   Hiring by state and local governments also 
appears to be holding up.  Employment ga ins in the second quarter averaged 21,000 per 
month, a bit above the average le vel of hiring over the past four years.  According to the 
Census Bureau, state and local tax revenues continued to dece lerate in the first quarter, 
posting an average increase of about 5 percent relative to a year earlier. 
Despite the slowing of state re venues, aggregate state budget bala nces still appear to be in 
generally good shape.  Recent data from the National Association of State Budget 
Officers (NASBO) indicate that states will end th e current fiscal year with balances in the 
range of 8 percent of expenditures on averag e—well above the threshold of 5 percent that 
is generally thought to provide an adequate fiscal cushion.  The situation varies across the 
states, however. Several states, such as California and Florid a, are already under 
significant strain, while others , particularly the agricultura l and energy-producing states, 
remain in solid fiscal health.  The NASBO report indicates that states expect to face 
increasing budget pressures ove r the next few years from  decelerating revenues and 
further increases in Medicaid.  In anticipati on of these future pressures, state governors 
have proposed increasing nominal expenditures only about 1 percent in fiscal 2009.   
Under the assumption that these proposed budgets are enacted and that spending and revenues come in as the governors expect, ye ar-end balances in fiscal 2009 would be 
roughly the same share of e xpenditures as in fiscal 2008. 
Prices 
Headline consumer price inflation has stepped up in recent months, spurred by sizable 
increases in food and energy prices.  On the ba sis of the June data for the consumer price 
index (CPI) and PPI, we estimate that overall PCE prices increased 0.8 percent last month 
after having risen 0.4 percent in May.  These increases would push the average annual 
rate of inflation over the first half of this year to 4½ per cent, up from 3½ percent over the 
12 months of 2007.   Excluding f ood and energy, PCE price inflation also is estimated to 
have been elevated in June, but, on balance, co re prices have increased this year at about 
the same rate as last year. 
We estimate that PCE energy prices climbed nearly 7 percent last month after having 
moved up more than 4 percent in May.  The recent run-up in energy prices has brought 
the change over the first half of this year to an annual rate of near ly 30 percent, up from

11 Sharply higher prices at the pump have weighed on the demand for gasoline, and gasoline 
inventories have increased to the upper end of their seasonal range this summer. 20 percent last year.  In the wake of the surg e in the cost of crude  oil this year, retail 
gasoline prices jumped in May and June after having declined slightly, on balance, in the 
first four months of this year.  Survey data  point to another large increase in gasoline 
prices in July.11  However, the recent drop in crude oil prices should greatly reduce the 
upward pressure on retail gasoli ne prices in coming months. 
We estimate that the PCE price index for food and beverages jumped 0.6 percent in June, 
and over the first six months of this year, thes e prices are estimated to have risen at an 
annual rate of 6¼ percent, up from 4¾ per cent over 2007.  Rising prices of agricultural 
commodities have continued to put significant up ward pressure on food prices this year.  
However, significant price increases have not been limited to food commodities; the 
index for food away from home, which tends to reflect broader inflati onary trends in the 
economy, has also accelerated this year.  Changes in spot prices for farm commodities are 
mixed since the June Greenbook:  Wheat pri ces are down noticeably in response to a 
good harvest that is well under way; prices for corn and soybeans have also declined on 
reports of more-favorable weat her in major growing regions.  However, livestock prices 
have risen further, reflecting strong demand and high feed costs.   Futures prices for farm 
products are consistent with a significant decel eration in crude food costs later this year. 
We estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.3 per cent in June after increases of 0.1 percent in 
both April and May.  Over the first six months of this year, core PCE prices are estimated 
to have risen at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, the same as in 2007.  The change in the market-based component of core PCE prices so far this year is also about the same as in 2007.  In the first half of this  year, prices for a wide vari ety of goods and services have 
accelerated.  Price increases for some, such as  airfares and transportation services, have 
no doubt been boosted by rising energy costs,  while those for a number of household 
goods likely reflect higher import prices.  At the same time, the indexes for motor vehicles and housing—weak areas of the economy—have decelerated. 
Some measures of year-ahead expectations  have moved up sharply in recent months; 
longer-run expectations have b een little changed recently but remain above their levels at 
the end of 2007.  According to the Reuters/Mi chigan survey, median expectations for 
inflation over the next 12 months moved up sh arply over the first half of this year and 
held at 5.1 percent in July, up noticeably from about 3½ percent at the turn of the year.  
Median expectations for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years edged down in July to 3.2 percent from their recent peak in May and Ju ne, but they remained a bit higher than

the average of 3 percent posted in 2007 and th e first quarter of this year.  Five-year 
inflation compensation derived from Treasury inflation-protec ted securities (TIPS) has 
declined 0.3 percentage point  since the June Greenbook but is about unchanged since the 
end of last year.  The measure of infl ation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead—at 2.9 
percent—has risen some since the June Greenbook and is  up 0.2 percentage point, on 
balance, this year.  These measures have exhibited greater variability this year, likely 
because of swings in the risk premiums that investors demand to induce them to hold 
relatively illiquid TIPS rather  than nominal securities. 
Excluding food and energy, sharp increases in the prices of products  and services at 
earlier stages of processi ng continue to put upward pr essures on business costs and 
consumer prices.  The PPI for core intermed iate materials moved up 1.3 percent in June, 
on top of a string of earlier larg e monthly increases.  The rise in June brought the increase 
in the first half of the year to an annual ra te of about 15 percent, up sharply from the pace 
of roughly 3 percent recorded last year.  Pric e increases have been particularly large for 
chemicals, plastics, and metal products.  The PPIs for trucking, rail transport, and 
delivery services also posted sizable increas es again in June and have moved up rapidly 
over the past year. 
In recent weeks, industrial materials pri ces have declined somewhat following large 
increases earlier this year:  Since the June Greenbook, both the Commodity Research 
Bureau spot industrials index and the Journal of Commerce  industrial commodities index 
have declined between 1 percent and 2 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  
 
 Overview 
Sentiment in financial markets deteriorated markedly early in the intermeeting period, 
largely because of heightened concerns a bout the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac, the health of financial institutions in general, and rising oil prices.  Those concerns eased somewhat in response to the federal government’s explicit support for Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, some bank earnings reports th at were better than expected, and declines 
in oil prices.  Nonetheless, equity prices decreased, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
corporate bond spreads widene d, mortgage rates rose, and investors marked down the 
expected path of monetary policy.  Mark et participants now place high odds on the 
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maki ng no change in the target federal funds 
rate at the upcoming meeting.  The yield on the two-year Treasury note decreased 
moderately over the intermeeting period, while yields on longer-term Treasury securities 
were about unchanged.  Near-t erm inflation compensation declined, likely owing to the 
drop in oil prices, whereas five-year forward inflation compensation increased.  Interbank 
funding and commercial paper markets remained strained.   
Net borrowing by businesses slowed somewhat in July.  Credit quality of the nonfinancial 
corporate sector slipped a bit in the first and second quarters.  House prices continued to 
fall in May, and delinquency rates on resident ial mortgages moved up fu rther.  Growth of 
consumer credit remained subdued in May.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, la rge majorities of domestic commercial 
banks further tightened their lending standards and terms on most categories of loans to 
businesses and households (see the appendix to this section).  In addition, second quarter 
earnings reports for a number of large banks indicated widespread increases in delinquency rates. 
Financial Institutions and Market Functioning 
Financial markets were buffeted over the in termeeting period by developments affecting 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as by re newed investor concerns about a further 
deterioration in the credit quality of other financial institutions, fu eled in part by the 
failure of a large thrift.  As pressures in tensified on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amid 
reports that they might need to raise a subs tantial amount of capita l, their stock prices 
tumbled through mid-July, and their credit default swap (CDS) premiums shot up.  For a 
time, investors reportedly pulled back from auctions of agency discount notes, and trading conditions in agency-sponsored mortga ge-backed securities (MBS) were said to 
be very poor.

1 Freddie Mac completed registration of an equity offering with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on July 18, facilitating its plans to raise additional capital. 
2 Developments at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spurred investor concerns about the financial 
condition of the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), an d secondary-market spreads on their senior debt 
rose in late June and early July but  are little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  In addition, 
many dealers have not been reporting quotes for CDS on FHLB debt for the past two weeks, suggesting 
that liquidity in this market is impaired.   On July 13, the Treasury Department a nnounced a proposal to support the two ailing 
government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and the Board of Governors authorized the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York to provide liquidity support at the discount window if 
necessary.  Subsequently, Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s stock prices reversed a 
portion of their earlier declines, premiums on CDS referencing their senior debt fell 
sharply, and both GSEs held auctions of s hort-term debt securities that were well 
received.1  However, option-adjusted spreads on MBS guaranteed by the GSEs were high 
and volatile over the intermeeting period.2  On July 30, legislation was enacted that 
largely incorporated the Treasury’s plan to  support the GSEs and included additional 
measures intended to help the housing market. 
Overall, second-quarter earnings  in the financial sector we re significantly below year-ago 
levels as banking organizati ons ratcheted up loan-loss provi sions and continued to write 
down the values of mortgage-related assets.  A number of financial institutions reported 
negative earnings, while several institutions raised significant amount s of new capital.  
CDS premiums for U.S. investment banks  and for large commercial banks rose 
moderately, on net, over the intermeeting pe riod, but are up somewhat more, on net, for 
regional banks.  CDS premiums on subordina ted debt issued by bank holding companies 
also rose substantially over the intermeeting period.      The intensification of concerns about the health of financial institutions left an imprint on 
the functioning of some financial markets.  CDS market functioning remained under stress over the intermeeting period, particularly for the CDS of financial firms.  Measures 
of liquidity for speculative-grade corporat e bonds deteriorated ma rkedly early on but 
have mostly recovered.  The average bid-as ked spread in the secondary market for 
leveraged loans widened slightly, and the av erage bid price on these loans moved down 
somewhat, which put additional pressures on banks attempting to reduce their backlog of previously underwritten deals.   
In short-term funding markets, strains pe rsisted over the intermeeting period.  Amid 
continued bank funding pressures, spreads of Libor over comparable-maturity OIS rates

 remained elevated, especially beyond the one-month horizon.  In the commercial paper 
market, 30-day spreads for both A2/P2 nonfinan cial paper and asset-backed commercial 
paper were about unchanged at elevated levels, and spreads fo r financial firms’ 
commercial paper trended higher.  Bid-aske d spreads on repos of GSE debt and, to a 
lesser extent, agency MBS, increased, and “haircuts” on GSE debt collateral rose 
moderately.  Conditions were little change d in repo markets for Treasury and non-agency 
collateral.  
Operations under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) were again well subscribed over the 
intermeeting period, with stop-out  rates above the primary cr edit rate, an indication of 
sustained funding pressures.  Primary credit  borrowing continued to be strong, reaching a 
record high on June 30, which likely reflected in  part the response of banks to quarter-end 
funding pressures.  In contrast, most Term Security Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions 
during the intermeeting period were undersubs cribed, and extensions of credit through 
the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) were small and infrequent over the past 
several weeks.   The Federal Reserve announced this week th e extension of the TSLF and PDCF beyond 
the year-end, along with an increase in the maturity of TA F loans to 84 days and a new 
program of options on draws on the TSLF around key calendar dates.  The spread 
between rates on 2008 Eurodollar futures cont racts and those on comparable maturity 
federal funds contracts declined following the announcement; reactions in other markets were limited. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Investors marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period.  Market participants a pparently anticipated the Committee’s decision 
to leave the federal funds rate  unchanged at the June meeti ng.  However, they reportedly 
read the accompanying statement as fairly ba lanced in its discu ssion of the risks to 
growth and inflation rather than suggesting greater concern about inflation as had been 
expected.  Money market futures rate s for early 2009 moved down roughly 10 basis 
points on the June FOMC announcement.  In s ubsequent weeks, futu res rates decreased 
further on financial jitters a nd in response to the Chairman ’s testimony on July 15, which 
was viewed as suggesting greater-than-anticipated concern about downside risks to 
growth.  In recent weeks, rates have revers ed part of these declines, bolstered by the 
federal government’s explicit support for the GSEs, some better-than -expected earnings

 reports from commercial banks, and the declin e in oil prices.  Economic data released 
over the intermeeting period had little net effect on policy expectations. 
On net, investors revised down the expected po licy rate at the end of this year about 30 
basis points.  Judging from options on federal funds futures, market participants assign 
very high odds on the target rate remaining at 2 percent at the August meeting.  Futures 
rates also indicate that invest ors now expect the target rate  to be left unchanged at the 
September meeting as well, consistent with th e average forecast in the July survey of 
primary dealers.  Further ahead, futures pr ices suggest a cumulative increase in the 
federal funds rate of more than 175 basis points by the end of 2010, about 30 basis points 
less than the rise anticipated at the time of the last FOMC  meeting.  The option-implied 
distribution of the federal funds  rate six months ahead narrow ed a bit, but it retained a 
moderate skew toward higher rates.   
Short-term Treasury yields declined, on balance, in line with policy expectations.  Two-
year nominal Treasury yields were down 19 basis points. Meanwhile, 10-year yields were about unchanged.  Five-year inflation comp ensation derived from yields on Treasury 
inflation-protected securities closely tracked  oil prices, ending the period down 33 basis 
points on net.  Inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead rose 19 basis points, with much of the increase occurring around the release of the June FOMC statement, the Chairman’s 
testimony, and higher-than-expe cted CPI inflation data. 
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity-price indexes declined about 4 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
as the energy sector substantially underperfo rmed.  Stock prices of financial firms were 
volatile and ended the period down about 2 percent.  The spread between the 12-month-
forward trend earnings-to-pric e ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury 
yield—a rough gauge of the e quity premium—climbed to th e top of its range over the 
past 25 years.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased significantly in 
late June and early July but was about unc hanged, on net, over th e intermeeting period. 
Yields on investment- and speculative-gra de corporate bonds rose, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, even as yields on compar able-maturity Treasury securities were little 
changed, pushing spreads back toward thei r March peaks.  Indexes of premiums on 
investment-grade CDS for nonfinancial firms changed little over the intermeeting period, 
while those for financial firm s increased notably, on net.

 Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
According to the approximately 300 second- quarter earnings reports in hand and 
analysts’ forecasts for the rest, earnings pe r share for S&P 500 firms are expected to 
come in about 18 percent below year-ago levels , mainly because of a sharp drop in profits 
in the financial sector.  In contrast, earnings per share for nonfinancial firms are estimated 
to have risen about 8 percent over year-ago levels, with roughly half  the gains accounted 
for by firms in the oil and gas industry.  Among firms that have reported, about three-
fourths posted earnings-per-share above anal yst forecasts.  Rega rding the outlook, an 
index of analysts’ expectations of year-a head earnings for S&P 500 firms was negative 
through mid-July. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms dete riorated a little in the first and second 
quarters.  The aggregate levera ge ratio of nonfinancial firms increased in the first quarter, 
and the aggregate ratio of liquid assets to to tal assets ticked down.  Rating downgrades on 
nonfinancial corporate bonds remained m odest but outpaced upgrades in the second 
quarter, and the number of nonfinancial fi rms on watch for a downgrade continued to 
exceed the number on watch for an upgrade.  The default of a large mortgage-related firm 
pushed up the six-month trailing bond default ra te in June, and the KMV-based aggregate 
year-ahead expected default rate jumped to its highest level since early 2003.   
Business Finance 
Overall, net debt financing by businesses has declined in July.  Bond issuance by 
investment-grade nonfinancial corporations sl owed from its rapid second-quarter pace, 
and speculative-grade issuance ticked down.  At the same time, outstanding nonfinancial 
commercial paper posted a solid gain, while commercial and industrial (C&I) loans 
apparently grew moderately.  According to th e July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, 
substantial majorities of banks tightened lending standards and terms on C&I loans over the past three months.  Public issuance of bonds  and equity by financial corporations sank 
in July, likely reflecting in part increased volatility in those securities. 
Both seasoned and initial equity offerings  remained weak in July, with almost no 
issuance outside the energy sector.  Equity  retirements from cash-financed mergers 
continued to fall in the s econd quarter, but announcements of new deals picked up.  
Retirements from share repurchases are also estimated to have continued to decline.  
Even so, net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained negative.

 Commercial Real Estate Finance  
The volume of sales transactions in the commer cial real estate sector remained weak in 
June, and a broad index of pr ices for commercial real estate edged down in the second 
quarter.  There has been no i ssuance of commercial mortga ge-backed-securities (CMBS) 
in July, and premiums on CDS written on CMBS rose over the intermeeting period, 
reversing more than half the declines from their rally earlier this year.  CMBS 
delinquencies remained low in June, but some  of the new CMBS delinquencies reflected 
the inability of borrowers to refinance large balloon payments as their initial loans came due.  Many large banking organizations noted in their second-quart er earnings reports 
that delinquencies on commercial mortgages—particularly loans to residential developers—increased.   
Household Finance  
Incoming data point to a further deterioration in  residential mortgage markets.  In the July 
Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey, most banks repor ted having tightened lending 
standards further over the past  three months for all classes of mortgage borrowers.  In 
addition, interest rates on conforming mort gages rose, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, a move consistent with higher spreads in the agency MBS market.  Interest rates 
on jumbo mortgages also increased.  In Ma y, the delinquency rates on both subprime and 
prime loans moved higher, and the monthly pur chase-only house price index calculated 
by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight declined further, dropping to a 
level about 5 percent below its  peak in April 2007.  The pr ices of indexes of CDS on 
AAA-rated tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities d eclined sharply early in the 
intermeeting period to record lows, but reversed a portion of these declines in recent 
weeks.  
MBS issuance by the GSEs was strong in the second quarter but is estimated to have 
slowed from that rapid pace in July.  Some  conforming MBS issued in the second quarter 
reportedly were backed by seasoned loan s from bank portfolios rather than new 
originations.  Residential mortgages held by ba nks have dropped steeply in recent weeks.  
Ginnie Mae issuance has increased over the past several months, as FHA originations continued to grow.  The market for private- label residential mortgage-backed securities 
remained closed.     
In May, the delinquency rate on auto loans at  captive finance companies stayed above its 
long-term average, and the delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools 
increased.  Growth in consumer credit in May remained near the middle of its range over

 the past few years.  Issuance of asset-backed  securities (ABS) collateralized by auto loans 
and credit cards slowed somewhat in July, and spreads widened for AAA-rated consumer 
ABS in response to increased concerns about credit quality and ongoing financial market 
turmoil.  Although conditions in the student  loan market have improved significantly 
from earlier this year, some lenders reporte d that the new Depart ment of Education 
procedures to support the mark et are difficult to implement. 
Long-term mutual funds attracted small net in flows in June, but preliminary data show 
sizeable net redemptions in early July amid falling equity prices.  Money market funds ran off in June, largely reflecting seasonal f actors.  Net inflows to money market funds 
appear to have resumed in July. 
Treasury Finance 
The Treasury Department conducted several au ctions of nominal and inflation-indexed 
securities over the intermee ting period, most of which we re well received.  Dealer 
participation at the 20-year TIPS reopening wa s, however, weaker than expected.  The 
6-month moving average of indirect bidding by foreign partic ipants continued to trend 
down.  In its mid-quarter refunding announcement, the Treasury Department announced 
that it is considering moving to a quarterly issuance schedule for 30-year bonds and that 
the Congress had approved an increase in the statutory debt limit. 
Liquidity in Treasury markets remained be low normal during the intermeeting period.  
Traders reported notably strain ed conditions in the bill ma rket approaching quarter-end 
and in early July as concerns about the GSEs increased.  Bid-asked spreads on coupon 
securities continued to be higher than historical norms.  However, yield-curve fitting 
errors stayed high as investor s apparently remain reluctant to arbitrage price differences 
across similar securities.  The spread between  on- and off-the-run ten-year notes also 
remained elevated, and the comparable spread  for two-year notes rose a little on net, 
indications of strong demand for relatively liquid securities.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds remained robust in July, partly reflecting 
additional restructurings of au ction rate securities.  A s ubstantial share of new capital 
issuance was for education and transportation projects.  Meanwhile, short-term issuance 
was also strong through July, consistent with  reports of budget shor tfalls of state and 
local governments.

3 Recent fluctuations in bank credit and its com ponents reflect larger-than- usual movements in the 
estimated seasonal factors.  The seasonal factors for Ju ne and July are difficult to estimate—particularly for 
commercial real estate loans—owing to the timing of changes in the panel of respondent banks. The credit quality of the municipal bond sect or remained solid.  The number of rating 
upgrades continued to outpace the number of downgrades in the second quarter. 
Downgrades picked up in July, reflecting dete rioration in the cred it quality of a few 
banks that provide liquidity support to tender option bonds, whic h are short-term 
securities backed by municipal bonds.  Yields  on long-term munici pal bonds were little 
changed over the intermeeting pe riod, as were ratios of long-term municipal bond yields 
to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries. 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 grew at an annual rate of 7½ percent in July after having b een about flat in June.  The 
pickup in money growth was broad based, and it  may have been partly attributable to 
safe-haven flows from equity mutual funds and other nonmonetary assets into liquid 
deposits and retail money market funds.  The expansion in small time deposits is largely 
attributable to a single institution offering high rates.  The growth of currency likely reflected greater domestic demand, but some indicators suggest that  foreign demand for 
dollars may have picked up from its recent sluggish pace. 
Comm
ercial bank credit is estimated to have increased only slightly in July, after having 
been about flat in June.3  C&I loans continued to rise moderately in July, while 
commercial real estate loans d eclined.  On the household side , residential mortgage loans 
on banks’ books contracted in July, on the heels of a steeper runoff in June that reflected 
heavy sales and securitizations with the GSEs .  In contrast, revolving home equity lines 
of credit expanded briskly in July, and c onsumer loans origin ated by banks grew 
modestly.  The weak growth in bank credit over the past two months is consistent with 
the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surve y, in which large fracti ons of banks reported 
having tightened lending st andards and terms on all major loan categories.

1 Banks received the survey on or after July 10 , and their responses were due on July 24. 
III-A-1  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey on Bank Lending Practices 
The July 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opin ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past 
three months.1 The survey included two sets of special questions: The first set queried domestic 
banks about securitizations with, or sales to, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of conforming-jumbo 
mortgage loans; the second set asked respondents how  they expected credit standards on loans to 
businesses and households at their bank to change in  the second half of 2008 and in the first half 
of 2009, assuming that economic activity progresses in line with consensu s forecasts.  This 
appendix is based on responses from 52 domestic banks and 21 U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks. 
In the current survey, large net fractions of domestic institutions reported having tightened their 
lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months. In particular, the net fractions of banks that ha d tightened credit standards on consumer loans 
increased notably relative to the Ap ril survey.  Considerable fractio ns of foreign institutions also 
had tightened their credit standards and terms on loans to businesses over the past three months, 
although these fractions were smalle r, on net, than those reported in the April survey.  Large net 
fractions of domestic and forei gn respondents expected their banks to tighten credit standards on 
all major loan categories in the second half of th is year, and smaller, though substantial, net 
fractions expected their banks to tighten standard s in the first half of 2009.  Finally, demand for 
loans from both businesses and households at dom estic and foreign institutions reportedly 
weakened, on net, over the past three months. 
Business Lending 
Questions on commercial and industrial lending.   About 60 percent of domestic banks—a 
slightly larger fraction than in the April surv ey—reported having tightened lending standards on 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three 
months.  About 65 percent of those institutions—up notably from roughly 50 percent in the April survey—also indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on C&I loans to small 
firms over the same period.  Significant majorities of domestic respondents indicated that they had tightened selected price terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes:  About 80 percent of banks—up from roughly 70 percent in the April survey—noted that they had increased spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds on C&I loan s to large and middle-market firms, whereas about 
70 percent of respondents—a somewhat higher fraction than in the April survey—reported having widened spreads on loans to small firms.  In  addition, significant fractions of domestic 
respondents reported having tightened non-price-re lated lending terms on C&I loans to firms of

 all sizes over the survey period, and the fraction of  banks that tightened such terms on loans to 
small firms increased considerably  relative to the April survey. 
About 35 percent of U.S. branches and agenci es of foreign banks—down from about 60 percent 
in the April survey—indicated that they had tight ened their lending standards on C&I loans over 
the past three months.  A majority of foreign respondents reported that they had tightened 
selected price terms on such loans, although the fr actions of foreign banks that reported having 
tightened such terms over the previous three months  were, on net, significantly smaller than in the 
April survey.   For example, about 60 percent of foreign banks—down from about 80 percent in the April survey—reported having raised spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the 
past three months. 
Very large majorities of domestic and foreign r espondents pointed to a less favorable or more 
uncertain economic outlook, their bank’s reduced  tolerance for risk, and the worsening of 
industry-specific problems as reasons for tighten ing their lending standards and terms on C&I 
loans over the past three months.  Roughly 65  percent of foreign respondents—up from about 
45 percent in the April survey—also noted that c oncerns about their bank’s current or expected 
capital position had contributed to the more-stringent lending policies over the past three months. 
In contrast, only about 25 percent of domest ic respondents—down from about 35 percent in the 
April survey—reported having tightened their lendi ng standards because of concerns about their 
bank’s current or expected capital position. 
On balance, the July survey poi nts to a further weakening of C&I loan demand over the past three 
months.  On net, about 15 percent of small domestic and 25 percent of  foreign banks reported 
weaker demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes over the survey period.  Regarding large 
domestic banks, about 10 percent of these institu tions, on net, noted weaker demand from small 
firms, although about 5 percent of these banks, on balance, reported that demand for C&I loans 
from large and middle-market firms had increased over the past three months. Substantial majorities of domestic institutions th at experienced weaker loan demand over the past 
three months pointed to a decrease in customer s’ needs to finance investment in plant and 
equipment as well as their needs to finance inventor ies.  In addition, about 75 percent of domestic 
and 70 percent of foreign respondents pointed to a decrease in customers’  needs for merger and 
acquisition financing as a reason for the lower demand  for C&I loans.  Regarding future business, 
small domestic and foreign institutions, on bala nce, reported that inquiries from potential business 
borrowers were about unchanged during the survey pe riod.  In contrast, about 15 percent of large 
domestic banks, on net, reported an increase in  the number of inquiries from potential business 
borrowers over the past three months. 
Questions on commercial real estate lending.   On balance, about 75 percent of domestic 
banks—a fraction similar to that in the April survey—reported having tightened their lending

foreign banks—down from about 55 percent in the April survey—also indicated that they had 
tightened their lending standards on commercial r eal estate loans.  Regarding demand for these 
types of loans, about 30 percent of domestic banks and 45 percent of foreign institutions—fractions slightly smaller than those in the April survey—reported weaker demand for 
commercial real estate loans over the survey period on net. 
Lending to Households 
Questions on residential real estate lending.   Large majorities of domestic respondents reported 
having tightened their lending standards on pr ime, nontraditional, and subprime residential 
mortgages over the previous three months.  A bout 75 percent of domestic respondents—up from 
about 60 percent in the previous survey—indicated  that they had tightened their lending standards 
on prime mortgages.
2  Of the 32 banks that originated nont raditional residential mortgage loans, 
about 85 percent—up from about 75 percent in the April survey—reported having tightened their 
lending standards on such loans.3  Finally, 6 of the 7 banks that originated subprime mortgage 
loans—a somewhat higher proportion than in the April survey—indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on those loans over the past three months.
4    
On net, about
 35 percent of domestic respondents— a slightly higher fraction than in the April 
survey—experienced weaker demand for prime resi dential mortgage loans over the past three 
months, and about 45 percent—up from roughly 30 percent in the April survey—indicated weaker demand for nontraditional mortgage loans ov er the same period.  On balance, 2 of the 
7 domestic banks that originated subprime mortgage loans—a proportion significantly smaller than in the April survey—reported weaker demand for subprime loans over the survey period. 
About 80 percent of domestic respondents—up from about 70 percent in the April survey—noted 
that they had tightened their lending standards for approving applications for revolving home 
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) over the past three months.  Concerning demand for this product, about 10 percent of domestic banks, on net, re ported weaker demand for HELOCs over the past 
three months, down from about 20 percent in the April survey.

5 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 raised the conforming loan limit through the end of 2008 for a 
first mortgage on a single-family home in the contiguous United States from $417,000 to 125 percent of the 
median house price in certain high-cost areas, with an overall cap of $729,750.  In the survey, conforming-
jumbo mortgage loans were defined as those that do not conform under the previous loan-size limits but do 
under the new limits.  
6 A total of 16 banks reported having securitized with, or sold to, the GSEs conforming-jumbo loans 
over the past three months. According to the Call Repor ts, these 16 banks accounted for about 60 percent of 
residential real estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of March 31, 2008.  A total of 
22 respondents expect their banks to securitize with, or sell to, the GSEs conforming-jumbo mortgage loans 
in the next six months. According to the Call Reports, these 22 banks accounted for about 70 percent of 
residential real estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of March 31, 2008.   Special questions on securitizations and sales of conforming-jumbo mortgage loans.5  About 
35 percent of domestic respondents indicated that  their bank had securitized with, or sold to, 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the government-s ponsored enterprises, or GSEs) conforming-
jumbo mortgage loans over the past three months, and about 45 percent of respondents expected 
their bank to do so over the next six months.6  As reasons for not securitizing or selling 
conforming-jumbo loans over the past three months or in the next six months, about 50 percent of 
respondents cited the cost of the GSEs’ guarantee fees or other pricing terms, and a similar fraction pointed to a lack of demand for conforming-jumbo loans.  Finally, about 40 percent of respondents pointed to the limited number of mort gage applicants at their banks who meet the 
GSEs’ underwriting criteria. 
Questions on consumer lending.  About 65 percent of domestic banks—up notably from about 
30 percent in the April survey—indicated that th ey had tightened their lending standards on credit 
card loans over the past three months, and about the same fraction of respondents—up from about 
45 percent in the April survey—reported having tightened standards on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  In addition, about 55 pe rcent of banks reported raising minimum required 
credit scores on credit card loans, and 60 percent of  respondents reported raising such scores on 
other consumer loans over the past three mont hs, up from about 30 percent and 35 percent, 
respectively, in the April survey.  In addition, 50 percent of respondents also reported reducing the extent to which both credit card and other cons umer loans were granted to customers who did 
not meet their bank’s credit-scoring thresholds.  Also, significant net fractions of respondents 
reported that they had reduced credit limits on credit card loans and raised minimum required 
down payments as well as spreads of loan rates on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  
On balance, about 35 percent of domestic banks —up from about 25 percent in the April survey—
expressed a diminished willingness to make consumer  installment loans relative to three months 
earlier.  Regarding loan demand, about 30 percent of respondents, on net, indicated that they had 
experienced weaker demand for consumer loans of  all types over the past three months, up from 
about 20 percent in the April survey. 
III-A-9 
 
 
 Special questions on the outlook for credit standards.  A final set of special questions in the 
July survey queried respondents about their outlook for changes in credit standards at their banks 
on loans to businesses and households in the second ha lf of 2008 and in the first half of 2009, 
under the assumption that economic activity pr ogresses in line with consensus forecasts. 
Responses to these questions suggested a gradual decline in the fractions of banks tightening 
lending standards over the next year, with very few banks expecting to ease standards over that 
period. 
Regarding loans to busine
sses, about 55 percen t of domestic and 45 percent of foreign 
respondents indicated that they expected their ba nks to tighten credit standards on C&I loans in 
the second half of this year, and about 45 pe rcent of domestic and 30 percent of foreign 
institutions, on net, anticipated tightening their lendi ng standards on these loans in the first half of 
next year.  Regarding commercial real estate lo ans, about 70 percent of domestic and 45 percent 
of foreign respondents believed that their institu tions would tighten thei r lending standards on 
these loans in the second half of 2008, and about 50 percent of both domestic and foreign banks 
anticipated doing so in the first half of 2009.   
On the household side, about 45 percent of domestic respondents noted that they expected their 
banks to tighten lending standards on prime residen tial mortgage loans in the second half of 2008, 
and about 30 percent, on balance, thought that they would tighten standards on those loans in the first half of 2009.  Concerning nonprime mortgage loans—a category that includes both nontraditional and subprime mortgage loans—about 65 percent of the respondents that reported 
having originated such loans indicated that they anticipated tightening their lending standards in 
the second half of the year, and about 50 percent belie ved that they would do so in the first half of 
2009.  About 60 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported that they expected to tighten their credit standards for approving applications for revolving HELOCs through the end of 2008, 
and 40 percent of banks anticipated a tightening on these products in the first half of 2009.  
Regarding credit card loans, about 60 percent of domestic respondents indicated that they expected their banks to tighten standards on th ese loans in the second half of 2008, and about 
35 percent, on balance, thought that their banks would tighten such standards on these loans in the 
first half of 2009.  Finally, about 50 percent of respondents reported that they expected to tighten their lending standards on consumer loans other th an credit cards through the end of 2008, and 
30 percent, on net, indicated that they anticip ated doing so in the first half of next year.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $59.8 billion in May, as a large increase 
in ex
ports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.   
 
In May, exports rose 0.9 percent, supported by strong exports of industrial supplies, 
particularly of petroleum products, and services.  Increased exports of passenger cars 
pushed up automotive exports, while exports of consumer goods were flat after jumping 
up in April.  Exports of agricultural products fell back a bit in May but remained at an 
elevated level.  Exports of capital goods recorded a substantial decline following a large 
increase in April.      
The average value of exports in April and May increased 15.1 percent (a.r.) from the first 
quarter, with a large portion of the increase reflecting higher exports of industrial 
supplies.  Exports of agricultural goods, consumer goods, capital goods, and services also 
recorded strong growth.  Exports of automotive products were a weak spot, recording a 
slight decline.      
IV-2 
 
IV-3 
 
 
 
IV-4 
The value of imports of goods and services rose 0.3 percent in May, boosted in part by a 
strong increase in imports of consumer goods, with televisions recording a particularly 
lar
ge jump.  Imports of capital goods moved up, supported by a surge in  computer 
imports.  Imports of industrial supplies and services imports also showed solid growth.  
In contrast, the value of petroleum imports fell back despite higher prices, as the volume 
of
 imports declined steeply.  Imports of automotive products also fell in May.         
 
    
   The
 average value of imports in April and May increased 14.6 percent (a.r.) from the first 
qua
rter, with imports of industrial supplies exhibiting particular strength.  Capital goods 
and consumer goods also recorded robust gains.  The value of oil imports rose, as an 
increase in the price of imported oil more than offset a decline in volumes.  In contrast, 
imports of automotive products declined. 
P
rices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  In June, prices of core imports rose 1 percent.  This increase mostly 
re
flected higher prices for material-intensive goods, which rose 2.5 percent after rising 
1.3 percent in May.  Prices for products made with steel and iron rose sharply in June.  
P
rices for imported finished goods rose a moderate 0.2 percent in June, the same pace as 
in May.   
The average level of core import prices in the second quarter was 13¾ percent (a.r.) 
above the first-quarter average, as prices increased in all major subcategories.  Prices for 
material-intensive goods rose 32 percent.  Prices for finished goods increased 5¾ percent, 
a pace 1¾ percentage points above that in the first quarter.  Prices of consumer goods 
contributed to the acceleration of finished goods prices, increasing 5¾ percent in the 
se
cond quarter.  Prices of capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors also 
accelerated, rising at a pace of 8½ percent, twice as fast as in the first quarter.  Much of 
the pr
ice increase for capital goods is due to higher prices for oilfield equipment, but 
prices for many other capital goods are also higher. 
Oil.  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 7.4 percent in June.  Similarly, the spot 
price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $133.93 per barrel in June, up 
6.8 percent from the May average.  In early July, the spot price of WTI climbed to above 
$145 per barrel but has since fallen back to $1 22.19 per barrel as of July 29.  The price of 
futures for delivery at the end of 2016 moved in a similar fashion, closing on July 29 at 
$118. 18 per barrel.  Increasing geopolitical risk likely provided support for oil prices 
during June and early July, as tensions escalated in the Middle East and violence

continued in Nigeria.  Prices have fallen back rapidly, however, amid rising concerns 
over the strength of economic activity and the resulting implications for global oil 
demand.  In addition, the most recent data from the International Energy Agency indicate 
that Saudi Arabia increased production in June, and market participants expect further 
production increases in July. 
  
 
 
 
 Exports.  Core export prices rose 1 percent in  June.  Almost all of the increase was due 
to higher prices for material-intensive goods.  Prices for agricultural products and 
nonagricultural industrial supplies both increased over 2 percent.  The increase in 
agricultural prices was driven by higher prices for soybeans, corn, meat, and fruit, which 
more than offset declines in wheat and vegetable prices.  For nonagricultural industrial 
supplies, the June increase was primarily driven by rising fuel prices, although higher 
prices for inorganic chemicals and plastics also contributed to the rise.  Prices for finished 
goods were little changed.  
The average level of core export prices in the second quarter was 12 percent (a.r.) above 
the first quarter average.  Much of the rise can be attributed to a 26 percent increase in 
pr
ices of nonagricultural industrial supplies.  Agricultural prices, having increased at a 
58 percent pace in the first quarter, were up only 14½ percent in the second quarter.  
Prices of exported finished goods were up 2½ percent, a rate comparable to that in 2007. 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
S
ince the June Greenbook, we have received data on U.S. international financial 
transactions for May, along with partial and confidential data on custody accounts at 
FRBNY through July 29.   Foreign official flows into the United States were $46 billion 
in Ma
y, on par with April’s figure and near their six -month average (line 1 of the 
Summary of U.S. International Financial Transactions table and the chart on Foreign 
Of
ficial Financial Flows).  
Among foreign officials, the G-10 and the ECB reduced their holdings of U.S. securities 
by nearly $11 billion in May, the largest outflow since 2006 (line 1a);  
.   Inflows from OPEC (line 1b) and from other countries (line 
1c) remained strong.  On net, foreign official inflows in May were concentrated in agency 
bonds.  Da
ta on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that official net purchases of 
agency bonds and Treasury securities likely remained strong during June but eased 
somewhat in July (see inset chart). 

IV-8 
Foreign private purchases of U.S. securities  
totalled $31 billion in May, exceeding the pace 
of the first quarter but well below the pace of 
the fourth quarter of 2007 (line 4 of the 
Summary of U.S. International Financial 
Transactions table; see also the chart on Private 
Securities Flows).  In contrast to foreign 
officials, foreign private investors continued 
selling agency bonds in May (line 4b) at the 
near record pace that began in March (top right 
panel of the chart); foreign private investors on 
net purchased Treasury securities,  but these 
purchases were modest (line 4a).  Outside 
agency bonds and Treasury securities, foreign 
private investors on net purchased corporate bonds; these purchases were well above the 
pace of the past six months (line 4c).  Net purchases of corporate stocks (line 4d) were 
about in line with their six-month trend.    
 
After r
ecording small net sales in April, U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities in May 
amounted to $27 billion (line 5), exceeding their six-month trend; these purchases were 
concentrated on foreign stocks (line 5b).  The bottom left panel of the chart shows that, 
despite their month- to-month volatility, private acquisitions of foreign securities have 
been declining, on average, since 2007.  This decline has been concentrated in purchases 
of foreign bonds.  Such purchases were especially weak early this year, in line with low 
issuance of foreign bonds.     
 
The volatile
 banking sector (line 3) posted a further net 
outflow in May.  Since the turmoil began in August 
2007, net lending 
abroad by banks has increased with 
unusual consistency (see inset chart).  These outflows, 
primarily
 from foreign-owned banks lending to 
European affiliates, likely reflect tensions in interbank 
funding markets and cumulate to a sizeable $336 
billion betwe
en August 2007 and May 2008. 
 
 

IV-9 
Finally, U.S. official assets (line 2) showed a $27 billion outflow in May, reflecting 
primarily an increase in the amounts drawn from the temporary swap arrangements with 
the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank.  These swap arrangements were 
also the primary contribution to the $24 billion outflow for this line in the fourth quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets  
Concerns about the GSEs weighed on the dollar and foreign stock markets, but both 
rebounded as U.S. earnings reports and macro data generally exceeded market 
expectations.  The major currencies index depreciated almost 2 percent between July 7 
and July 15, the period when worries about the GSEs were at their height, but it 
subsequently appreciated as investor sentiment improved and is now only unchanged 
from its level at the time of the June Greenbook.  Despite this market volatility, concerns 
about the GSEs seemed to have had little impact on foreign official demand for agency 
debt.  Although the major foreign stock markets erased most of the losses that they 
suffered in mid-July, they have still declined 6 to 8 percent on net since the June 
Greenbook amid signs that growth in the foreign advanced economies is slowing.  
 
 As expected, the European Central Bank (E CB) raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 
4.25 percent on July 3.  In the following press conference, President Trichet indicated 
that he consider ed policy to be neutral.  Expectations of further policy tightening in the 
advanced foreign economies have diminished as growth has appeared to slow and as the 
recent decline in oil prices has eased inflation fears.  Ten-year benchmark sovereign 
yields have declined 15 to 30 basis points in the euro area, United Kingdom, and Japan 
since the June Greenbook, while ten-year inflation compensation has declined roughly 
10 basis points in the euro area and Japan and 45 basis points in the United Kingdom.  
Pressures in interbank funding markets have eased modestly since the June Greenbook.  
Quarter-end pressures were high by historical standards but comparable to experience 
over the past year, as overnight euro and sterling Libor rates declined about 25 basis 
points at the start of the third quarter.  Spreads between euro Libor and OIS rates declined 
about 10 basis points as European banks appeared to successfully lock in funding in the 
days prior to the quarter end, and spreads between sterling Libor and OIS rates declined 
by a similar amount in mid-July.  British banks appear to be securitizing assets for use as 
collateral at the Bank of England’s special liquidity scheme, and their ability to make use 
of the scheme may be partly responsible for the modest easing of funding pressures in 
sterling.  Implied rates from foreign exchange and currency basis swaps indicate that the 
interest rates paid by European financial institutions for dollar funding also eased 
somewhat.  However, demand at the dollar term-funding auctions held by the ECB and 
Swiss National Bank  (SNB) remained strong, with the ECB’s auction s drawing record 
amounts of bids.  On July 30, The ECB and SNB announced that they would extend the 
maturity of a portion of their auctions of dollar funding from one-month to three months 
IV-14 
in collaboration with the Federal Reserve, but it is too soon to gauge market reaction to 
this decision.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The renminbi appreciated a further ¾ percent against the dollar and the Mexican peso and 
Brazilian real both appreciated 2¼ percent as the central banks of those two countries 
have continued to tighten policy.  Several Asian countries struggled to cope with falling 
stock markets, spending billions of dollars in an effort to prop up share prices.  In 
Taiwan, government officials requested that the government pension and insurance funds 
buy more domestic shares and hold their investments for a longer period. In Vietnam, the 
stock exchange and securities regulator erected a stabilization fund to support the 
countr y’s stock market.  Pakistan also announced that it would establish an equity market 
stabilization fund in the wake of rioting over falling stock prices.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Across the advanced foreign economies, information received since the last Greenbook 
points to subdued growth in the second quarter and increasing inflation pressures.  Weak 
second-quarter data on industrial production and sentiment in the euro area and on 
consumer expenditures and exports in Japan suggest the first-quarter pop-up in output 
growth was not sustained.  In Canada, where output declined in the first quarter, 
indications are for a mild rebound on improvements in the manufacturing sector.  In 
contrast, conditions have worsened considerably in the United Kingdom, with the 
housing sector looking particularly grim.  In all the major advanced foreign economies, 
rising food and fuel prices continue to drive inflation to recent highs, although core 
measures of inflation have generally remained contained.  The European Central Bank 
tightened policy in July, but other major central banks held rates constant.  Currently, 
market participants are expecting the major foreign central banks to keep monetary policy 
on hold through the rest of the year. 
IV-21 
 
 
IV-22 
Recent indicators point to a sizable step-down in Japanese  output growth in the second 
quarter, after the first- quarter’s 4 percent (a.r.) jump.  Surve y measures of household 
spending contracted, consumer and business sentiment declined sharply, and industrial 
production fell last quarter.  Real growth of merchandise exports has also slowed 
c
onsiderably since the beginning of the year, with export volume falling 3.2 percent over 
the thr
ee months ending in June, reversing the previous quarter’s gain.  
 
 
 
 
 
 The labor market is weakening.  The unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent in June, and 
the job openings- to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative 
to the number of officially registered job seekers) fell to 0.91 in June, its lowest level 
since February 2005.  In addition, total cash earnings (which include bonuses) rose just 
0.8 percent over the twelve months ending in May. 
Rising energy and food prices have been the primary reason for the 2 percent increase in 
Japanese consumer prices over the twelve months ending in June.  Consumer prices 
excluding fresh food rose nearly as much, but excluding food and energy, prices were 
roughly unchanged from last year.  The timelier core CPI for Tokyo rose 1.6 percent  in 
July from a year earlier.  At its mid-July meeting, the Bank of Japan unanimously voted 
to keep its main policy rate unchanged. 
IV-23 
 
IV-24 
Incoming data for the euro area  point to a stalling of economic activity in the second 
quarter, consistent with payback from the first-quarter GDP surge as well as underlying 
softness.  The earlier bounce was strongly influenced by unusually warm weather that 
brought forward German construction.  In May, euro-area industrial production decreased 
markedly, while German new orders for manufacturing goods declined further.  Both 
manufacturing and services PMIs for the euro area indicate contraction, and business and 
consumer confidence continue to deteriorate.  After months of declines, retail sales 
posted positive growth in May, but the average April-May level of retail sales was still 
down 0.7 percent from the first quarter.  Lending to the private sector continued to grow 
at a robust though somewhat moderating pace with most of the slowing concentrated in 
loans to households, especially mortgages.   
 
 Twelve-month HICP inflation rose to 3.9 percent in June, on the back of a 16 percent 
spike in energy price inflation.  Excluding energy and unprocessed food prices, inflation 
was around 2½ percent.  Following its July meeting, the ECB Council increased its main 
policy rate ¼ percentage point to 4.25 percent, and President Trichet indicated that he 
considered monetary policy to now be neutral.   
IV-25 
 
 
IV-26 
In the United Kingdom , real GDP rose a tepid 0.7 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, 
after a downward-revised 1.1 percent in the first quarter.  Declines in the manufacturing, 
construction, and financial-related services sectors weighed on second-quarter growth.  
Most recently, business confidence dropped sharply in July, consumer confidence slid to 
a near fifteen-year low in June, and second-quarter surveys of investment intentions 
showed further softening.  The number of individuals claiming unemployment benefits 
rose 4  percent in the second quarter, the largest increase since the early 1990s.   
 
 The slump in the housing sector has also deepened further since last Greenbook.  In June, 
house price indexes flirted with double-digit declines relative to their peak last fall and 
mortgage lending for house purchases dropped by two thirds over the past twelve months.  
The anticipation of further price declines, along with higher mortgage rates, tighter 
lending standards, and the uncertain economic situation, has kept potential home buyers 
at bay.   
The twelve-month rate of headline inflation jumped to 3.8 percent in June, reflecting one 
of the largest monthly increases since 1991.  The main contributors to the rise were 
energy and food products, especially gasoline, fruits, and meat.  Core inflation, which 
excludes energy and unprocessed food, firmed to a decade-high of 2.3 percent.  Earnings 
growth remained contained, however, with the indexes including and excluding bonuses 
in May standing about 3½ percent higher than twelve months earlier, slightly below the 
five-year average.  The Bank of England kept its policy rate unchanged in July. 
IV-27 
 
IV-28 
In Canada , indicator s suggest GDP growth returned to positive, albeit subdued, territory 
in the second quarter.  Real GDP by industry advanced 0.4 percent in April from the 
previous month; manufacturing activity, especially in motor vehicles, rebounded 
following a downturn in the first quarter, and wholesale and retail trade were up sharply.  
Volumes of manufacturing shipments and new orders rose in April and May.  Second-
quarter housing starts were down about 4 percent from the first quarter, but remain in line 
with their five-year average.  Consumer spending also continued to expand, although 
more slowly than in the previous two quarters, with the average level of real retail sales 
in April and May 2.3 percent (a.r.) higher than in the first quarter.   In April and May, real 
exports outpaced real imports. 
 
 
 
 Total employment expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter.  Continuing the trend 
of the past several months, full-time employment declined, while part-time employment 
expanded.  At 6.2 percent in June, the unemployment rate was at its highest level since 
early 2007, though still near a thirty-year low.   
The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation jumped to 3.1 percent in June, from 
2.2 percent in May, on the back of escalating energy prices and an end to the extremely 
low rates of food-price inflation over the past year.  However, t he Bank of Canada’s 
preferred measure of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components of 
the consumer price index as well as the effects of indirect taxes, remained  muted, ticking 
up to 1.6 percent in June, from 1.5 percent in May.  The Bank of Canada held rates 
constant at its July meeting.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Recent indicators for emerging market economies point to some slowing of growth in the 
second quarter.  Real GDP growth in China moderated but remained strong, supported by 
domestic demand.  Elsewhere in emerging Asia, incoming data suggest further slowing, 
including in India, Singapore, and Thailand, while second-quarter activity remained 
sluggish in Mexico. 
 
 
 
 Headline inflation rose further in much of the developing world, largely owing to higher 
food and energy prices, and several countries continued to face upward pressure on core 
infla
tion as well.  In contrast, in China, twelve-month headline consumer inflation 
c
ontinued to decline owing to a drop in food prices.  The rising cost of energy subsidies 
led several Asian countries to raise state-controlled fuel prices in June and July.  Since 
the tim
e of the June Greenbook, monetary authorities in emerging market economies 
have generally continued to tighten monetary conditions. 
In China , the staff estimates that real GDP increased 9.9 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second 
qua
rter, with China’s official release showing an increase of 10.1 percent (n.s.a.) on a 
four-quarter basis.  Growth has edged lower in the past year as external demand has 
weakened.  In contrast, domestic demand appears to have picked up steam in the second 
quarter.  Retail sales increased 23 percent in June from a year earlier.  Nominal import 
g
rowth was robust in the second quarter, although some of this increase likely reflects 
hig
her prices of imported oil.  Nominal export growth in the second quarter picked up a 
bit from the slow pace of the first quarter, but the four-quarter growth rate remains below 
that observed through most of last year.  The trade surplus in the second quarter fell to 
$217 bil
lion (s.a.a.r.) from more than $250 billion in the previous two quarters. 
Twe
lve-month consumer price inflation declined to 7.1 percent in June from a peak of 
8.7 percent in February, as food price inflation continued to wane.  In contrast, twelve-
mont
h non-food price inflation edged up from 1.6 percent in February to 1.9 percent.  In 
June, bank lending decelerated to its slowest pace since mid-2006, helping to cool 
inflationary pressures.  Foreign reserve accumulation also slowed; reserves increased 
$12 billion in June, down from an average of $50 billion per month over the first five 
mont
hs of 2008.

India’s industrial production declined slightly on average over the first two months of the 
second quarter.  The trade deficit widened further through May, reflecting increases in 
prices of oil and other commodities.  Inflation, measured by the widely followed 
wholesale price index, jumped to 11.4 percent in June, largely due to hikes in fuel prices.  
In response, the central bank raised the repo rate 50 basis points in late July.  The United 
P
rogressive Alliance (UPA) government narrowly won a confidence vote on July 22 that 
was held in response to its decision to meet commitments under the U.S.-India nuclear 
a
greement.  The UPA victory may help pave the way for needed structural reforms.

In the  NIEs1, on balance, data point to slower  GDP growth in the second quarter.  Korean 
real GDP growth remained steady at 3.4 percent in the second quarter, with growth 
supported by the external sector, as domestic demand was weak.  In Singapore, the 
advance (unofficial) estimate suggests that real GDP contracted sharply in the second 
quarter as a result of a fall in output of the volatile biomedical sector, weak electronics 
production, and slow exports.  In Taiwan, industrial production slowed.  The merchandise 
trade balance improved in Hong Kong and in Taiwan; the latter’s balance swung from a 
small deficit to a surplus as the value of imports declined. 
 
 Twe
lve-month consumer price inflation moved higher in the NIEs, largely reflecting 
higher food and energy prices, although there have been some upward pressures on core 
inflation as well.  In Taiwan, twelve-month inflation increased more than one percentage 
point in June after administered fuel prices were raised.  In late June, Taiwan ’s central 
bank raised its policy rate an eighth of a percentage point, its sixteenth consecutive 
increase.

In the ASEAN-4 area, incoming indicators generally point to a moderation in activity in 
the second quarter.  In Indonesia, industrial production declined on average over April 
and May, while consumer confidence reached a two-year low in June.   In Malaysia and 
Thailand, industrial production held up, but in Thailand, indicators of private investment 
and business sentiment deteriorated.  In the Philippines, strong remittances have helped 
support domestic demand.  In April and May, a fall in capital goods imports contributed 
to the improvement in the trade balance in the Philippines and Thailand. 
 
 Increasing food and energy prices continue to push consumer price inflation higher.  In 
July, in response to the rising fiscal costs of fuel subsidies, the Indonesian and Malaysian 
governments raised administered prices of fuel and Malaysian authorities indicated that 
they will eliminate fuel subsidies by end-August.  In contrast, domestic prices of fuel in 
Indonesia remain well below market prices.  Thailand, which had eliminated its fuel 
subsidies in 2006, reenacted significant subsidies on some fuels in July.  Inflation has 
become the major concern of central banks in the region.  The central banks of Indonesia, 
the Philippines, and Thailand raised interest rates further to combat inflation.

Financial conditions facing Vietnam  deteriorated sharply over the past few months, but 
have improved in July.  Headline consumer price inflation has risen sharply in recent 
months and in June surpassed 25 percent on a twelve-month basis, boosted by food 
prices, which comprise more than 40 percent of the CPI.  Concerns about rising inflation 
and the large and widening current account and fiscal deficits put the dong under strong 
downward pressures in late June.  Pressures appeared to abate after the central bank 
raised its policy rate 200 basis points to 14 percent in June and after the government 
outlined steps that it would take to tighten fiscal policy.  In late July, authorities 
announced a surprise 30 percent increase in the retail price of gasoline, which brought the 
retail price to market levels. 
 
 
  
 Data from Mexico present a mixed picture on activity in the second quarter.  Industrial 
production continued to edge down, as growth in the mining, utilities and construction 
sectors was more than offset by a contraction in manufacturing.  Retail sales increased on 
average over the April-May period relative to the first quarter.  The trade deficit 
narrowed somewhat, as exports inched down and imports declined more substantially. 
Headline and core inflation continued to increase in June.  Both readings exceeded 
5 percent on a twelve-month basis, above the 4 percent upper bound of the central bank’s 
target range.  In response, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate by ¼ percentage 
point in each of the last two policy meetings, bringing the rate to 8 percent. In addition, 
the Mexican government secured an agreement with food suppliers to freeze the prices of 
certain food items.  In late July, the central bank suspended dollar sales to the market in 
an effort to contain upward pressures on the peso, which has appreciated 7 percent so far 
this year.

 In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook also provide a mixed picture on the 
second quarter.  Industrial production over the April-May period was roughly unchanged 
from the first-quarter level.  Nonetheless, performance was strong in the natural resource-
intensive sectors (including mining, petroleum extraction and refining, and ethanol 
refining).  Retail sales in April and May expanded, but at a slower pace than in the first 
quarter, supported in part by rapid growth in credit.  Import growth continued to be very 
rapid, partly reflecting strong domestic demand.  However, the nominal trade surplus 
rebounded from a weak first quarter, in part reflecting payback from strikes that 
depressed exports.  Exports were also boosted by the rise in commodity prices. 
Both headline and core inflation continued to be sources of concern, in June reaching 
6 and 5½ percent, respectively.  Inflation expectations have also been creeping up, 
according to survey data.  In response, the central bank continued to tighten policy, 
raising the overnight rate 75 basis points to 13 percent in late July.

 In Argentina , following a sharp slowdown in the first quarter, activity was weak in the 
second quarter, weighed down by disruptions from the four-month- long farmers’ strike.  
Industrial production declined on average in April and May.  The trade surplus narrowed 
in the second quarter through May, in part reflecting a strike-related fall in exports.  The 
strikes ended in late July, when the government’s proposed increases in export taxes on 
several agricultural products were narrowly rejected by the Congress.  Tensions between 
the government and the farmers have also put considerable downward pressures on 
Argentine asset prices and have led to a decline in foreign reserves.  Reported headline 
consumer price inflation continued to rise, surpassing 9 percent in June on a twelve-
month basis, amid large increases in prices of services, such as housing, transportation 
and health.  Questions about the reliability of official inflation data continue.

 In Venezuela , real GDP fell by an estimated 9 percent in the first quarter, and we still 
expect a partial rebound in the second quarter.  Credit growth slowed considerably in the 
first half of 2008, most likely depressed by the rise in interest rates in recent months and 
by the deterioration in the business climate.  Vehicle sales in April were down by over 
15 percent on a twelve-month basis.  Inflation continues to rise; twelve-month headline 
consumer price inflation surpassed 30 percent in June, boosted by soaring food prices.

In Turkey, recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth softened in the second quarter 
following rapid first-quarter growth.  Industrial production growth slowed on average in 
April and May.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation remained high, but monthly 
inflation declined in June, as food prices declined.  At its July meeting, the Monetary 
Policy Committee raised the overnight borrowing rates 50 basis points to 16.75 percent.  
In June, the central bank raised the upper bound of its inflation target from 6 to 
7.5 percent for 2009, but lowered the 2011 upper bound from 6 to 5.5 percent, noting that 
food and fuel price pressures will abate over the medium term.
