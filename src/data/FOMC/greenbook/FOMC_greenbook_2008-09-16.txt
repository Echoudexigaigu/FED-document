1 The extended benefits program increases unemployment for two reasons.  First, the program draws 
some individuals who were out of the labor force into unemployment because a person must be looking for 
work to collect benefits.  Second, the program reduces  the incentive for benefit recipients to actively seek 
and accept employment offers. Economic activity appears to have decelerated  considerably this quarter.  The labor 
market deteriorated further in July and A ugust, as private payro lls declined and the 
unemployment rate moved sharply higher.  In addition, industrial output likely fell 
steeply in August, in part because of large cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies and in 
energy output.  On the spending side, consum er spending appears to be weakening under 
the ongoing pressures from declining household wealth, sluggish real wages, tight credit conditions, and dismal sentiment.  Meanwhile , residential investme nt has continued to 
move down at a pace similar to that seen in recent months.  In contrast, business 
investment in equipment (other than motor ve hicles) and structures appears to have held 
up early this quarter.  Consumer price infl ation has moved up significantly in recent 
months.  However, some of the pressure s driving up inflation seem to be easing. 
Labor Market Developments  
The labor market has continued to deteriorate.  According to the August employment report, private payroll employ ment fell 101,000 last month, a slig htly larger decline than 
the average pace seen from January to July of this year.  Most major industry groups shed 
jobs last month; manufacturing posted a particularly noticeable loss of 61,000.  
Employment also fell by 37,000 in the relate d temporary help serv ices industry.  In 
contrast, job losses in the construction indus try diminished over the past two months 
despite the ongoing contraction in residential investment.  Nonbusiness services, which 
include the education and health industries , and natural resources  and mining showed 
increases in line with those of recent months.  With the average workweek of production 
and nonsupervisory workers holding steady, aggregate hours have edged lower, and in August they stood 1.5 percent at an annual rate below the second-quarter average. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate jumped 0.4 percentage point, to 
6.1 percent, last month.  Both adult men and adult women experienced large increases in 
their unemployment rates, while the unemploym ent rate of teens re traced only a small 
portion of its steep increase between April and July.  We think th at part of the rise in the 
overall unemployment rate in August was due to the emergency unemployment benefits that went into effect in July.
1  However, the remainder seems indicative of a further 
increase in labor market slack.  Another m easure of slack, the fraction of workers who

are working part time for economic reasons, also continued to rise in August.  
Meanwhile, the labor force participati on rate held steady at 66.1 percent. 
Initial claims for unemployment insuran ce under regular state programs have moved 
considerably higher since the July/August Greenbook.  We think that the level of these 
claims has also been boosted by the emerge ncy unemployment compensation program, as 
it was the last time such a program was in place, in 2002, because some individuals who 
apply for extended benefits turn out to be e ligible for regular bene fits (for which they 
must file a claim).  However, claims have re mained elevated for longer this time than in 
2002, an indication that the labor market may have weakened further over the past month. 
Most other labor market indicators also sugge st a further weakening of the labor market.  
With regard to separations, the short-term j ob losers rate has changed little on balance in 
recent months, but the layoffs and discharges rate, as measured by the Job Openings and 
Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), edged up fu rther in July.  In addition, announcements 
of downsizing plans compiled by Challenger, Gr ay, and Christmas, Inc., remained at a 
high level in August. 
With regard to hiring, both the JOLTS hiring rate and the JOLTS job openings rate have 
continued their downward trajector ies.  Perceptions of job ava ilability in the Conference 
Board survey edged down further in A ugust, while the National Federation of 
Independent Business (NFIB) measure of hard-to-fill positions remained at a very low 
level last month.  The outlook for hiring re mains gloomy.  According to the Manpower 
survey, firms have lowered their fourth-quarter net hiring plans appreciably.  And while hiring plans in the NFIB survey ticked up in August, the three-month moving average 
stands close to its nadir in the last recession. 
According to both the Reuters/University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys, 
household expectations of future labor market  conditions have improved a bit from their 
very low mid-summer levels.  Even so, these ex pectations remain at lower levels than at 
any time since the early 1990s. 
With real GDP reported to have posted a siza ble increase even as hours were declining, 
the staff estimates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 4½ percent last quarter after having increa sed at a rate of 2½ percent in the first 
quarter.

accounts release, productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at  an annual rate of 4.3 percent last

3 Major industry groups with above-average operatin g rates in July included aerospace products and 
parts, which has been supported by the continued rollout of the more fuel-efficient Boeing 787 Dreamliner; 
energy-related industries , such as petroleum refining and oil and gas extraction; computers and 
communications equipment; food; and primary metals. rose 3½ percent.  In the nonfinancial corpor ate sector, the gain in productivity over the 
past year was somewhat smaller, at 2¼ percent. 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) is on track to post another decline in the third quarter after 
having fallen at an annual rate of more than  3 percent in the second quarter.  Output in 
July edged up 0.2 percent, but the production indicators for August suggest that IP fell 
sharply last month.  In particular, aggregate hours of production workers in 
manufacturing declined 1.1 pe rcent, and the available weekly production data, which 
cover about one-quarter of IP, point to a plunge in motor vehicle assemblies and declines 
in the output of refined petroleum products  and electricity generation.  The factory 
operating rate in July, at 77.7 percent, was 2 percentage points below its 1972–2007 
average and 2½ percentage points below its recent peak in July 2007; most major 
industry groups are operati ng at below-average rates.3 
Motor vehicle assemblies fell more than 1½ m illion units in August to an annual rate of 
8.2 million units.  The drop in production refl ects a decision by the automakers to scale 
back their production plans following the plunge in  July vehicle sales.  At a 9 million unit 
pace, third-quarter schedules are now 1¾ milli on units below the level of assemblies in

2007 and only a little above the second-quarter  pace, when strikes severely curtailed 
production at General Motors.  Preliminary schedules for the fourth quarter are for 
production to remain at about this low level. 
Although the number of new vehicles in inventor y has not been particularly elevated by 
historical standards, days’ supply reached an  uncomfortably high level of 88 days at the 
end of July, due to the plunge in sales that  month.  However, the cut in assemblies, 
combined with a recovery in the pace of sales, caused da ys’ supply to drop back to 
71 days in August, a level much closer to th e automakers’ target of 65 days.  The excess 
stocks that remain are concentrated in light  trucks, where days’ supply had jumped to an 
extremely bloated 115 days in July before dropping back to 80 days in August; days’ 
supply of autos stood at a relativ ely lean 61 days last month. 
Elsewhere in transportation, the production of  aircraft and parts has jumped during the 
past few months.  As of August, Boei ng had about 3,700 unfilled orders and was 
producing about 40 planes per month; Boeing’ s backlog, all else being equal, would 
support production for quite some time.  Howe ver, Boeing’s machinists went on strike 
last week, which idled most domestic capaci ty for commercial aircraft assembly.  
Prospects for resolution of the strike are uncertain, but if th e strike were to last one 
month, we estimate that it would take down manufacturing IP by roughly ½ percentage 
point in September and a small effect on Oct ober as well—similar to the experience with 
the previous strike in 2005. Following a sizable gain in the s econd half of last year, the output of high-tech equipment 
decelerated to a modest annual growth rate  of about 17 percent in both the first and 
second quarters of this year.  Computer production decelerated noticeably in the second 
quarter after having been booste d by strong server sales in th e first quarter.  Reports from 
computer manufacturers are mixed, but, on bala nce, they indicate that foreign demand 
has been robust and domestic demand has been soft.  Looking ahead, International Data Corporation’s projection for computer sales s uggests that production is  likely to increase 
moderately in the third quarter; however, the mixed tone of recent statements from manufacturers suggests a fair bit of un certainty.  Production of communications 
equipment stepped up in the second quarter, co nsistent with a strong increase in revenue 
at Cisco.  However, capital spending guidan ce for telecommunications service providers 
(TSPs) suggests little impetu s to third-quarter production.
4 
                                                 
4 TSPs are estimated to account for roughly one-third of private communications equipment investment 
and production.

The weaker demand from computer and communications equipment manufacturers 
contributed to a deceleration in semiconductor production in the first half of this year, 
after a considerable increase in the second ha lf of last year.  For the third quarter, 
production gains will likely remain relatively subdued; for example, a major manufacturer reported that it is not seeing the usual seasonal boost to orders in advance 
of the holiday season.  In addition, although inventory-sales ratios for semiconductors do 
not appear excessive, they seem to be creepi ng up at contract elec tronics companies and 
at wholesale chip companies, and some recen t reports have cited excess inventories of 
DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and flash memories. 
Elevated energy prices continue to spur drilling for oil and na tural gas.  Output in this 
industry increased at an annual rate of 5½ pe rcent so far this year.  Hurricane Gustav, 
which passed through the center of  the Gulf of Mexico at th e end of August, led to the 
evacuation of most oil and natural gas extracti on platforms and rigs in  the region as well 
as to the precautionary closure of some oil refineries.  These actions appear to have 
reduced the August change in IP by less than 0.1 percentage point but will have a more 
noticeable effect in September as the produc tion stoppages extended well into the month.

Output excluding the production of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech 
equipment was little changed for a third month in July.  The output of consumer goods slipped further, continuing a trend that started in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The 
production of business equipment rose about ½ percent in July after having edged up, on 
net, over the previous two months, but much of  the increase is attributable to a rebound in 
the volatile farm machinery ca tegory.  Elsewhere, the produc tion of construction supplies 
has changed little, on net, over the past seve ral months, as increases in the output of 
supplies more likely to be associated w ith nonresidential construction have provided 
some offset to further sharp declines in the production of supplies typically tied to 
residential construction.  The output of business supplies ha s continued to trend down, 
with notable negative contributions from printing and publishing.  Lastly, the output of 
materials to be further processed in the i ndustrial sector was little changed in July. 
Near-term indicators of production suggest that the industrial sector is likely to remain 
soft over the next few months, though out put growth will undoubtedly be boosted at 
some point by a strike-related rebound in production at Boeing and the return to 
production of energy facilities in  the Gulf of Mexico.  The new orders diffusion indexes 
                                                 
5 As of September 9, nearly 80 percent of crude oil production and about 65 percent of natural gas 
production in the Gulf of Mexico remained offline; in addition, one petroleum refinery remained entirely 
shut down.  These numbers are likely to incr ease reflecting the effects of Hurricane Ike. 
II-13 
from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the various regional surveys have 
generally remained below 50.  While the thre e-month moving average of real orders for 
durable goods (adjusted to ex clude industries for which reported orders have little 
information content for predicting shipment s) has edged up a bit in recent months, it 
remains consistent with weak IP.  In addi tion, foreign demand, which has helped support 
IP for much of the past year, shows signs of slowing.  For example, a trade-weighted 
average of the industrial production indexes fo r some of the United States’ major trading 
partners has been falling since late last year. 
Motor Vehicle Sales  
Demand for light vehicles impr oved last month but remained at a relatively low level.  
After having plunged to an annual rate of ju st 12.5 million units in July, light vehicle 
sales rebounded to 13.7 million units in Augus t, about the same pace as in June.  
.  The August 
increase in light vehicle sales likely reflecte d, in part, an expansion of customer incentive 
programs by the automakers.  In particular, sa les at General Motors surged more than 
800,000 units (annual rate), and the company c ited a strong response to its “Employee-
Discount-For-Everyone” program.6  More generally, the availability of cash rebates and 
cut-rate financing has risen sharply in the pa st few weeks.  In addition, while concerns 
over gasoline prices remain high, they appear to have subsided a little as prices have 
eased; the percentage of respondents to th e Reuters/Michigan survey who cited high 
gasoline prices or gasoline shortages as reasons for their negative view of car-buying 
conditions moved down somewhat in August, and demand shifted back towards trucks 
and away from autos last month. 
Besides high gasoline prices and weak macr oeconomic fundamentals, a number of other 
forces appear to be weighing on the demand for light vehicles.  In particular, lower trade-
in values for light trucks have reduced the cash that many consumers expected to have on 
hand to apply toward the purchase of new vehicl es.  The lower trade-in values have also 
prompted several automakers to pull back  from leasing, which typically has accounted 
for about 20 percent of sales, because thei r lending arms are accruing large losses when 
consumers return leased vehicles that have  fallen out of favor, such as large SUVs.7  
Finally, consumers also face tighter credit conditions for more traditional financing—
both from captive auto finance companie s, such as GMAC, and from banks. 
                                                 
6 Although General Motors’ employee pricing program was originally scheduled to expire on 
September 2, the company extended it until the end of September. 
7 Chrysler has decided to exit the leasing business altogether, and Ford and General Motors have 
announced plans to scale back vehicle leasing.

Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending has weakened noticeably in  recent months against the backdrop of a 
deteriorating labor market, higher food and energy prices, lower equity and housing 
wealth, and depressed sentiment.  Moreover, the temporary boost to spending growth from the tax rebates seems to be waning.  Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 
declined 0.4 percent in July after having edge d lower in June, as a result of a precipitous 
drop in motor vehicle outlays and a substa ntial decline in spe nding on other goods in 
those two months.  The recent weakness in consumer spending on goods excluding motor vehicles contrasts sharply with surprisingl y solid growth in th e spring.  Meanwhile, 
outlays for services (excluding the volatile energy components) were reported to have 
increased modestly in June and July.
8 
The weakness in real consumer spending re flects the challeng ing conditions that 
households currently face.  In the second quarter, lower equity prices and the ongoing 
declines in house prices pushed the ratio of wealth to income down for a third consecutive quarter to about its  level in early 2004.  Subdued gains in wages and salaries, 
combined with sharply higher food and energy prices, have also rest rained the purchasing 
power of households.  Excluding the tempor ary boost of roughly $90 billion (current 
dollars not at an annual rate ) in tax rebates disbursed from May through July, real 
disposable income fell at an annual rate of ¾ percent last quarter and continued to move 
lower in July.  Consumer sentiment remain s depressed, although readings from both the 
Reuters/Michigan and Conference Board survey s improved modestly in July and August.  
In spite of an apparent tightening of lending standards, credit card balances continued to 
increase at a solid pace in July as households likely borrowed to support their spending. 
Housing  
Residential construction activity  continued to dec line steeply through mid-year.  In July, 
single-family housing starts fell to an a nnual rate of 641,000 units, while adjusted permit 
issuance—a useful month-ahead indicator of starts—slid to an annual rate of 593,000 
units.  At an annual rate of decline of 22 per cent, the contraction in single-family starts 
over the three months ending in July was similar to the rate of decline earlier in the year.  In the multifamily sector, starts fell to 324,000 units in July, mostly reversing the 
previous month’s outsized gain.  June’s spike in multifamily starts can be traced to more- 
                                                 
8 As always, recent quarters’ estimates of real services spending—comprising over 60 percent of total 
PCE—may not be offering a timely view of the overall spending trajectory, because spending on several 
categories of services are based on judgmental trends  for the period more recen t than the 2006 Service 
Annual Survey.

stringent building codes that took effect in New York City on July 1, which apparently 
led developers to pull forward the start da te of some planned apartment projects. 
Home sales have moved sideways in recent m onths at very weak levels.  The Census 
Bureau’s measure of sales agreements for new homes—at 515,000 units in July—has 
changed little in recent months, but is down 35 percent from a year ago.  Sales of existing 
single-family homes have been relatively flat since the end of last year, and recent readings of the pending home sales index suggest  that sales will remain at a low level in 
the near term.
9 
Recent cutbacks in new residential constructi on have further reduced the level of new-
home inventories, and the flat pace of sales in recent months has allowed these inventory 
reductions to finally start to bring down the months’ supply of new homes for sale.  Even so, the months’ supply of new homes for sale remains extremely elevated at more than double the level that prevailed prior to the downturn in the housing market. 
Tight conditions in mortgage credit market s over the summer continued to restrain 
housing demand.  The deterioration has been es pecially acute for mo rtgages that cannot 
be purchased by government-sponsored enterpri ses (GSEs); securitization of such loans 
has virtually halted, and lendi ng spreads remain very wide.  Conforming mortgage 
markets had also tightened over the summer.  As of last week, the average rate for a standard 30-year fixed-rate conforming mort gage had risen about 30 basis points since 
May to 6.4 percent; however, rates at some lende rs have reportedly retraced most of this 
increase in the past few days in respons e to the conservators hip of Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac.  Non-price lending terms also tightened considerably over the summer as 
the GSEs’ tighter lending standards made conforming mortgages more difficult to obtain.  Moreover, down-payment requirements have  become more bindi ng for many potential 
borrowers (notwithstanding the first-time ho mebuyer tax credit described in the footnote 
above) because primary mortgage insurers have tightened standa rds and are charging 
higher fees, and because fewer lenders are wi lling to extend second mortgages that would 
allow borrowers to sidestep these requirements. 
House prices remain on a downward trajectory.  For existing homes, the monthly version 
of the purchase-only repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal Housing  
                                                 
9 A provision of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, passed at the end of July, offers 
first-time home buyers a tax credit of up to $7,500 on homes purchased between April 9, 2008, and 
June 30, 2009; the homebuyer must pay back this cr edit (without interest) in the succeeding 15 years (or 
sooner if the house is resold).  The tax credit is no t expected to have any effect on published home sales 
statistics until August or September.

Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased 4.8 pe rcent over the 12 months ending in June.  
By comparison, the national S&P/Case-Shill er repeat-sales pri ce index—which, unlike 
the OFHEO index, includes houses financed by nonconforming loans—fell about 
15 percent over the past year.  As for ne w homes, the constant-quality price index—
which attempts to control for changes in the quality and geogra phic composition of new 
homes sold—was down 3½ percen t in the second quarter relative to its level a year 
earlier.  Although these lower pric es may be starting to bolster sales, survey evidence and 
anecdotal reports suggest that expectations of further house price declines remain quite 
prevalent, a consideration th at may make potential buyers re luctant to purchase homes 
until prices show signs of stabilizing. 
Equipment and Software  
We estimate that investment in equipment a nd software (E&S) fell at  an annual rate of 
3½ percent in the second quarter, largely becau se of a sharp drop in business spending on 
motor vehicles.  In contrast, growth of r eal outlays for nontransportation E&S held up 
reasonably well last quarter.  More recently, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense 
capital goods excluding ai rcraft rose substantially in Ju ly, although some of the gain in 
nominal shipments reflected unusually large pr ice increases.  Moreove r, as in previous 
months, July orders and shipments may have  reflected increased foreign demand.  Thus, 
the nominal shipments data likely overstates  the true strength of domestic investment 
demand. 
Along those lines, the fundamental determinants  of E&S investment appear consistent 
with weak domestic demand.  Although bus iness output growth has not decelerated 
substantially over recen t quarters, other determinants  of business spending suggest 
gloomier prospects.  The user cost of cap ital has been rising, as corporate bond yields 
have edged up this year, despite declining Trea sury yields, and capital goods prices have 
accelerated.  In addition, corporate profits have weakened, and cash flow moved down 
again last quarter.  And although monthly readings of business conditions—both national and regional—have edged up over the past fe w months, they remain downbeat for the 
most part. 
Business outlays on transportation equipmen t fell sharply in th e second quarter as 
business purchases of light trucks tanked.  Spending on light motor vehicles appears to 
have declined again this quarter, a result of automakers aggressively scaling back 
deliveries to daily rental companies in A ugust; demand from other businesses remained 
sluggish as well.  Moreover, sales of medi um and heavy trucks fell back a good bit in 
July from the already-subdued rate observed in recent months.  The pace of new orders

for these trucks also slumped in July, an indication that sales are unlikely to improve in 
the near term.  Domestic aircraft investme nt stepped up in the second quarter, but the 
Boeing machinists’ strike, as mentioned above, seems likely to cause a drop in deliveries 
this quarter. 
Spending on high-tech E&S posted a moderate ga in in the second quarter, as robust gains 
in investment in communications equipment were balanced by tepid growth of spending 
on computers.  In the current quarter, the lukewarm 2008 guidance from TSPs (as noted 
earlier), along with the decline of computer orders and shipments in July, suggests 
weaker spending may be in store. 
Nominal orders and shipments of equipmen t other than high-tech and transportation 
jumped in July.  Although July’s data partly reflected a large rise in prices and perhaps 
another increase in foreign demand, these factors are probably not large enough to 
explain the entire nominal increase.10  Furthermore, orders outpaced shipments by a 
considerable m
argin in June and July.  July’s increase in  orders was relatively broad 
based, with particular strength seen in or ders for measuring and controlling devices, 
heating and ventilation equipment, industr ial machinery, and construction machinery. 
Nonresidential Construction  
Real nonresidential investm
ent (other than dr illing and mining) increas ed at a robust rate 
in the second quarter.  However, nominal expenditures declined in July, and market 
fundamentals and forward-looking indicators remain downbeat.  Vacancy rates in the 
office and industrial sectors moved higher in the first half of the year  after several years 
of declines, and vacancy rates for retail sp ace continued on an upward trajectory.  In the 
resale market, sales of existing commercial prop erties have plunged so far this year from 
2007’s record pace, and prices seem to be soft ening.  On the financing side, issuance of 
commercial mortgage-backed securities has fall en dramatically this year, corporate bond 
spreads remain wide, and the Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices reported a dramatic tightening of standards for commercial real estate loans over the first half of this y ear.  Meanwhile, construction costs are also surging:  The 
producer price index for materials and component s of construction rose at an annual rate 
of 23 percent over the three months endi ng in July, and anecdotes from general 
contractors suggest that pri ce increases for key constructi on inputs (like asphalt, steel, 
and plastic materials) are squ eezing profit margins.  These developments appear to be 
depressing plans for new projects.  Indeed, th e three-month average of  the architectural  
                                                 
10 The producer price index for thes e capital goods rose 0.8 percent in July, which accounted for a 
sizable portion of the 2 percent increase in July nominal shipments.

billings index has registered a string of weak readings th at are suggestive of outright 
declines in nonresidential  building outlays in the s econd half of this year. 
Supported by rising energy prices, investment in drilling and mining structures increased 
at an annual rate of nearly 25 percent in the first half of the year.  Recent readings for 
footage drilled and the number of drilling ri gs in operation suggest that investment 
continued its upward climb in July and August. 
Business Inventories  
Firms drew down their inventories at a rapi d pace in the second quarter, and book-value 
data for the manufacturing and wholesale trad e sectors suggest that inventories declined 
further in July.  The indicators we track ar e not sending a clear si gnal regarding whether 
firms are holding excess inventories.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales 
(excluding motor vehicles) continued to tre nd down through June.  However, information 
from the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that months’ supply excluding 
motor vehicles and parts remains elevated, pa rticularly in areas such as construction 
supplies, business equipment, and, to a lesse r degree, consumer goods.  Anecdotal reports 
of inventory imbalances have been limited to light trucks and some categories of 
semiconductors.  Meanwhile, purchasing managers reported that their customers’ inventories were high in August, as the ISM’ s customers’ inventories index came back up 
to about the elevated valu e it had attained in June. 
Federal Government Sector  
The deficit in the unified federal budget conti nued to widen in July as outlays surged, the 
last major wave of stimulus rebates was sent out, and tax receipts were about flat.
11  
Adjusted for payment-timing shifts and fina ncial transactions, the unified budget deficit 
in July was $33 billion larger than the adjust ed deficit in July of last year, with the 
stimulus rebates accounting for almost half the erosion.12  The Congressional Budget 
Office, in its updated budget outlook released  on September 9, anticip ates an unadjusted  
                                                 
11 The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 authorized an expected total of $112 billion in stimulus rebates, 
with $94 billion already sent out by the end of August, another $5 billion to be disbursed over the 
remainder of calendar year 2008, and nearly $13 billion to be distributed during the 2009 tax-filing season. 
12 The deficit in July on an unadjusted basis that includes financial transactions was even wider, as the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation spent $14 billion to cover insured deposits at failed financial institutions.  Moreover, the Daily Treasury Statements show that another $4 billion in outlays for deposit 
insurance were made in August and September.  These outlays are expected to be recovered over time as 
the assets of the failed institutions are sold and the premium payments made by financial institutions to 
cover deposit insurance are raised.

deficit for fiscal year 2008 of $407 billi on and projects the deficit to widen to 
$438 billion in fiscal 2009, both a bout 3 percent of nominal GDP. 
Federal outlays in July, adjusted for paymen t-timing shifts and financial transactions, 
were 10 percent above last July’s level.  Nominal defense spending increased almost 
18 percent from its year-earlier  level and is consis tent with a robust increase in real 
defense purchases this quarter as measured in the national income and product accounts.  
Transfer payments in July moved up briskly relative to a year earlier; they were boosted 
by outsized increases in outlays for Medicare and Medicaid and also by the portion of the 
stimulus rebates sent to households with little  or no tax liability (such rebates are counted 
as transfer payments in the budget).13 
Excluding the effects of the stimulus rebates, tax receipts in July were about unchanged 
from their year-earlier level a nd increased only 2 percent in the 12 months ending in July 
relative to the comparable peri od a year earlier.  The slowdown in the inflow of federal 
tax receipts has been most pronounced in corpor ate taxes, probably because of the decline 
in corporate profits over the past year.  Ne t corporate receipts ove r the 12 months ending 
in July were 14 percent below their level in the year-earlier period.  Individual income 
and payroll taxes, excluding the stimulus re bates, posted a gain of  only 4 percent, an 
increase likely consistent with the slowing pace of personal income. 
The Congress has been slow to work on the an nual appropriations bills necessary to fund 
discretionary federal spending programs in fiscal 2009, which begins  on October 1.  So 
far, the House has passed only one of the 12 appropriations bills, and the Senate has 
passed none.  A continuing resolution will be needed to fund agencies covered by 
appropriations bills that have not been enact ed by the start of the new fiscal year. 
The placing of the GSEs Fannie Mae and Fre ddie Mac into conservatorship will likely 
lead to additional budgetary costs through pur chases by the Treasury of the equity or 
mortgage-backed securities of the GSEs, which would be counted as outlays in the unified budget.  The Treasury reports that it will begin purchasi ng new GSE mortgage-
backed securities in September.  The Treas ury also has agreements with Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac to purchase up to $100 billion in senior preferred stock from each GSE in 
order to help keep each enterprise's assets greater than its liabilities.  At this time, however, the magnitude of these costs is highly uncertain. 
                                                 
13 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the temporary emergency unemployment insurance 
program will increase benefits by $12 billion until the program expires at the end of March 2009.

State and Local Government Sector  
The incoming indicators point to a modest rate of increase in real state and local spending 
in recent months after taking account of both the late st data and the substantial revisions 
to earlier figures for employment (downward) and construction (upward).  According to 
the latest labor market report, state a nd local employment rose 18,000 in August, the 
same as the average gain recorded so far this year.14  Meanwhile, real construction 
expenditures now seem
 to have rebounded sharply in the second quart er after a steep drop 
earlier in the year.  In July, nominal construc tion spending rose to a level 1¾ percent (not 
at an annual rate) above its sec ond-quarter average; this gain reflected sizable increases in 
all major categories but highways and set the st age for a further rise in real construction 
spending in the third quarter. 
On the whole, state and local revenue flows have been reasonably subdued of late, 
although the available data point to a no ticeable—though likely tr ansitory—pickup in 
receipts growth in the second quarter.  Drawing on inform
ation from 45 states, the 
Rockefeller Institute of Government estimates  that state tax revenue s increased 5 percent 
on a year-over-year basis in the second quart er after having posted  increases in the 
neighborhood of just 2 percent in the preceding two quarters.15  Personal income taxes 
rose 8 percent—an increase that appears to  have been boosted by a solid rise in final 
paym
ents of previous-year tax liabilities and thus is unlikely to be repeated in coming 
quarters.  As for the other major categories, collections of sales a nd corporate taxes both 
declined over the year ending in the second quarter, while ot her revenues rose sharply, 
especially in energy-producing states like Texas and Alaska. 
Prices  
Headline consum
er prices rose rapidly for a th ird consecutive month in July.  Driven by 
further large increases in food and energy pri ces, overall PCE prices rose 0.6 percent in 
July, thereby bringing the 12-month change to 4.5 percent, 2¼ percentage points higher 
than the year-earlier increase.  After some surprisingly low increases  in the spring, core 
PCE prices saw larger increases in June and July, which likely reflect ed, in part, further 
cost pressures and higher import prices.  Indee d, prices for goods at intermediate stages 
of production continued to rise rapidly through July.  Nevertheless, some cost pressures  
                                                 
14 State and local employment is now estimated to have risen just 6,000 in June and 2,000 in July 
compared with the previous estimates of 41,000 in June and 28,000 in July.  The downward revision was 
concentrated in local education employment, which is often revised substantially over the summer months. 
15 The missing states are New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Virginia.  
Taken together, these states accounted for 9 perc ent of state tax revenues in fiscal 2007.

may be weakening:  The dollar has strengthe ned, and spot commodity prices for crude 
oil, natural gas, and other industrial raw materials have declined recently. 
Consumer energy prices rose another 4 percen t (not at an annual rate) in July after 
similarly large gains in May and June.  This recent string of increa ses in energy prices 
pushed up the 12-month change through July to 30 percent.  Recent declines in crude oil 
prices have eased the pressure on gasoline ma rgins, which had been abnormally tight for 
some time, and are now leading to lower prices at the pump.  Indeed, survey data suggest 
that retail gasoline pric es decreased considerab ly in August and early September.  Spot 
prices for natural gas have also moved down r ecently as inventories (seasonally adjusted) 
have remained ample. 
Consumer food prices rose 1 percent in July, an even larger incr ease than the already 
elevated readings seen in recent months.  The 12-month change through July now stands 
at 5.7 percent, much higher than the 3.9 pe rcent increase recorded over the preceding 
12 months.  Although prices for almost all f ood commodities are substa ntially above their 
levels from a year ago, these prices have stepped down, on balance, since the July/August 
Greenbook (cattle is one notable exception).  However, prices  for food away from home 
have accelerated in the past few months; these prices tend to reflect broader inflationary 
pressures and tend to be  relatively persistent. 
Core PCE prices increased 0.3 percent for a second month in July.  These increases 
pushed up the three-month change through July to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, up from 
a pace of only 1.9 percent during th e three months ending in April.16  The 12-month 
change in core PCE prices, at 2.4 percent, is  up nearly ½ percentage point from the year-
earlier increase.  This accel eration was widespread across prices for goods and most 
services; one important exception is housing se rvices, for which prices have decelerated 
over the last 12 months, a slowdown consistent with the general weakness in this sector. 
The cost pressures affecting finished goods pr ices are showing through even more clearly 
to prices of intermediate materials.  Th e producer price index fo r core intermediate 
materials rose 2 percent in July, which brought  the three-month change to an annual rate 
of 23 percent.  These price increases have b een widespread but are especially noticeable 
for metals and for energy-intensive categories such as chemicals, plastics, and paints.  The string of recent advances pushed the 12-m onth change through July to 10 percent,  
                                                 
16 In addition to the larger increases in overall co re PCE prices in June and July, data on the non-
market component of these prices were revised up earlier in the year as part of the annual revisions to the 
NIPA.

nearly 8 percentage points higher than the change over the preceding 12 months.  
Nevertheless, as with energy and many food commodities, prices of industrial 
commodities have moved lower in recent weeks.   Both the Commodity Research Bureau 
spot industrials index and the Journal of Commerce  industrial commodities index have 
moved down since the July/August Greenbook, declining 6 percen t and 10½ percent 
respectively. 
Measures of inflation expecta tions are flat or down a littl e since the last Greenbook.  In 
the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, median expectations for year-ahead inflation 
moved down to 4.8 percent in August but still remain 1½ per centage points higher than 
they were late last year.  The Reuters/Michig an measure of median inflation expectations 
over the next 5 to 10 years held steady at 3.2 percent last month, down from its recent 
high of 3.4 percent but still above its January r eading of 3.0 percent.  As measured by the 
Survey of Professional Economists, expectations  for PCE price inflat ion over the next 10 
years held steady at 2.2 percent in the thir d quarter.  Finally, inflation compensation 
derived from yields on nomina l and inflation-protected Treasury securities has moved 
down since the last Greenbook, and the 5-year fo rward measure is now close to its level 
around the turn of the year. 
Labor Costs 
Hourly compensation has continued to increase  moderately with no sign of acceleration.  
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business s ector was revised down in the first half 
of the year on the basis of earnings data from unemployment insurance records through 
the first quarter.  We now estimate that compen sation per hour rose at  an annual pace of 
3¾ percent in the first half —about the same as the increase over 2007.  More recently, 
average hourly earnings increased 0.4 per cent in August and thus brought the 12-month 
change to 3.6 percent, down from 4. 0 percent over the preceding 12 months.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Over much of the intermeeting period, financia l markets were strained by concerns about 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and about the pros pect of continued wr ite-downs and credit 
losses at financial institutions more broadly.  Some uncertainty was resolved on 
September 7, when the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ha d been placed into conservatorship and 
that Treasury would establis h a backstop lending facility  for Fannie and Freddie and 
initiate a program to purchase mortgage-back ed securities (MBS).  In the two days 
following the announcement, spreads on Fa nnie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and on 
agency MBS decreased significantly, while sh are prices for their common and preferred 
stock plunged. 
 
 
 On net over the intermeeting period, investors pu shed back their expectation for the onset 
of monetary policy tightening to the third qua rter of next year and marked down their 
expected level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2010 about 60 basis points.  Yields 
on both intermediate- and long-term nominal Treasury securities decreased over the 
intermeeting period, and inflation compensa tion derived from yields on Treasury 
inflation-indexed securities fell in the near- and far-term.  Broad equity indexes moved a 
bit lower, on net, while risk spreads on co rporate bonds increased so mewhat.  Indicators 
of business and household credit quality pointed to a further deterioration, and the pace of 
borrowing generally continued to slow.    
Financial Institutions and Market Functioning 
Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s lower-than-ex pected second-quarter earnings results 
intensified concerns abou t the ability of the two housing government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs) to raise fresh capital to offset mounting losses on their mortgage 
exposures.  Before the conservatorship announc ement, prices for the GSEs’ preferred and 
common stock had declined on balance since the August meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC), while credit default swap (CDS) spreads on the GSEs’ 
senior debt narrowed further, as market  participants speculated that a possible 
government intervention regardi ng the GSEs could significantly dilute the existing shares 
but protect payments on senior debt.  In response to the announcemen t, risk spreads on 
the GSEs’ debt and MBS dropped further, whil e the value of their common and preferred 
stock plunged.  Fannie Mae’s auction of  $1 billion of 3- and 6-month bills on 
September 9 was reportedly well-received by the market.

CDS spreads for U.S. investment banks widened over the intermeeting period, but 
generally remained well below their March pe aks.  Lehman Brothers was the focus of 
much market commentary, as investors anticipated significant writedowns in the third 
quarter and speculated about the firm’s ability  to raise capital.  Lehman’s stock price 
plunged in recent days and its CDS spread jumped.  CDS spreads for commercial banks increased somewhat, on balance, with spreads for regional banks remaining substantially above spreads for large banks, likely reflecting greater concern about asset quality at the 
former and the implications for their funding.    
 Conditions in short-term funding markets remain ed strained over the intermeeting period.  
Spreads of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) over comparable -maturity overnight 
index swap (OIS) rates edge d higher from their already elevated levels.  In the 
commercial paper market, spreads on A2/P2 nonfinancial and asset-backed commercial 
paper fluctuated in a high range, as did spreads on financial commer cial paper.  The repo 
market for Treasury collateral continue d to function reasonably well over the 
intermeeting period, and there we re indications that conditions  in the repo market for 
agency debt and agency MBS may have im proved a little after Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac were placed in conservatorship.  Howeve r, over the intermeeting period as whole, 
median “haircuts” on agency MBS and private-label subprime and alt-A MBS repo 
transactions increased slightly. 
With regard to the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities, the 28-day Term Auction 
Facility (TAF) auctions conducted over  the intermeeting period were again 
oversubscribed, and stop-out rates were well above the primary credit rate and just below one-month Libor rates.  The Federal Reserv e conducted two auctions of 84-day TAF 
credit, both of which were oversubscribed.  Primary credit borrowing has climbed further 
since the August meeting of the Federa l Open Market Committee (FOMC), likely 
because of the facility’s rela tively favorable terms.  However, no credit was extended 
through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility over the intermeeting period.  Demand was 
strong for the three Term Secu rity Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions against Schedule 1 
collateral held over the period, while, as in pr evious auctions, the TS LF auctions against 
Schedule 2 collateral were undersubscribed.  On August 27, the first auction was held 
under the TSLF Options Program (TOP):  dealers bid on the option to draw on the TSLF for a one-week term period bracketing the quarter-end.  Demand at the TOP auction was

1 Results from the second TOP auction, scheduled for September 10, were not available in time for the 
Greenbook publication. Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The market’s expected onset of monetary po licy tightening was pushed back to the third 
quarter of next year amid he ightened concerns about the he alth of financial institutions 
and against a backdrop of deteri orating labor market conditio ns and a further decline in 
oil prices, which was seen as tempering infla tion pressures.  Futures quotes suggest that 
market participants expect slightly more th an 1 percentage point of policy tightening by 
the end of 2010, about 60 basis points less than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  
Uncertainty about the expected path of  policy decreased, as the option-implied 
distribution of the federal f unds rate six months ahead narrowed somewhat and became 
less skewed toward higher policy rates.  FOMC communications over the intermeeting 
period elicited very little market reaction, as the Comm ittee’s decision to leave the 
federal funds rate unchanged at the August FOMC meeting, as well as the accompanying 
statement and the subsequent release of th e minutes, were in line with investor 
expectations.   
Yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury se curities declined about 25 basis points and 
35 basis points, respectively.  Yields on 2- a nd 10-year inflation-indexed securities rose 
and were little changed, re spectively, leaving inflation compensation notably lower 
across the term structure.  The decrease in inflation compensation was most pronounced 
at shorter horizons, reflecti ng the expected effects of the drop in oil prices.  
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity price indexes decreased about 2 percent over the in termeeting period, with 
shares of retail firms widely outperforming th e market.  Financial sector indexes ended 
the period down 1½ percent, but were very volatile.  The spread  between the 12-month 
forward trend-earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury 
yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk prem ium—remained at the top of its range over 
the past 25 years.  Options-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained in the elevated range of the past year.  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds decreased 
slightly, while yields on speculative-grade bonds were little changed.  Given the

 relatively large decreases in comparable-m aturity Treasury yields, risk spreads on 
investment-grade bonds rose to the top of th eir historical range, and speculative-grade 
spreads nearly returned to th eir March peaks.  CDS spreads suggest that compensation for 
default risk for investment-grade financial firms rose markedly since the August FOMC 
meeting, while that for investment-grade  nonfinancial firms was little changed. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With nearly all second-quarte r earnings reports in hand, earnings per share for S&P 500 
firms are estimated to have dropped about 25 pe rcent from their year-ago level because of 
a plunge in financial sector profits.  Earn ings per share for nonfinancial firms are 
estimated to have increased about 7 percent ove r the past year, with roughly half the gain 
accounted for by the oil and gas industry.  An index of analysts’ expectations of earnings 
for S&P 500 firms over the coming year show ed a sharp downward revision in August, 
largely reflecting significant further ma rkdowns for the financial sector.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations  has deteriorated some in recent months.  
The net rate of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades by Moody’s in July was a little 
higher than in the second quarter.  The si x-month trailing bond default rate and the 
delinquency rate on commercial  and industrial (C&I) loans at commercial banks have 
both risen noticeably since the spring, although they remain at  low levels by historical 
standards.  The aggregate expe cted default rate over the ne xt year projected by Moody’s 
KMV rose in July, reaching its highest level since 2003. 
Business Finance 
Net debt financing by nonfinan cial businesses picked up in August from the weak pace in 
July, with the increase accounted for by a jump  in nonfinancial commercial paper (CP) 
outstanding.  Last month, some highly rated firms reportedly tapped the CP market to 
finance dividend payments and to fund, at  least temporarily, a large acquisition.  
Investment-grade bond issuance moderated a bit further in August, while speculative-grade issuance remained very light.  Bank lending to business through C&I loans was 
about flat during the July–A ugust period, likely reflecting bo th reduced demand for bank-
intermediated credit and the tighter terms a nd standards on these categories of loans that 
banks have reported in the past several Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveys.  
Both seasoned and initial equity offerings by nonfinancial corporations remained weak in 
August, with almost no issuance outside the en ergy sector.  In the second quarter, equity 
retirements from cash-financed mergers fell a bit further, but announcements of new

 deals continued apace.  Retirements from shar e repurchases are also estimated to have 
continued their decline in th e second quarter.  As a result, on net, nonfinancial firms 
retired equity in the second quarter  at the slowest pace since 2004.  
Commercial Real Estate 
The growth of commercial mortgage debt slowed sharply in th e second quarter and 
appears to have come down further this quart er.  In August, the value of commercial real 
estate transactions slipped to  its lowest level since early  2004, a decline reflecting the 
much tighter supply of financing for these tr ansactions and lower pr ices of commercial 
properties.  In the second quarter, prices of  transacted properties were about 10 percent 
below their year-ago peaks.  Issuance of co mmercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
was zero in July and August, and yield spread s for CDS indexes of BBB-rated tranches of 
CMBS reached a new high in mid-August before moving down in recent weeks. 
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by commercial banks climbed to  
4¼ percent in the second quarter, the hi ghest level since 1995, as delinquencies for 
construction loans, particularly those associated with residential projects,  rose further.  In 
contrast, the delinquency rate for commercial mortgages held in CMBS remained quite 
low in August, and almost no loans held by li fe insurance companies were delinquent in 
the second quarter.   
Household Finance 
Before the GSE conservatorship announcement was made, interest rates on 30-year fixed-
rate jumbo mortgages and conforming mo rtgages had decreased about a quarter 
percentage point since the August FOMC meeting.  The decline in the conforming 
mortgage rate was less than that on compar able-maturity Treasury securities, thereby 
leaving the mortgage spread at the top of its range over the past  two decades.  In part, the 
elevated primary market spreads reflected  unusually high option-adjusted spreads for 
agency MBS amid unsettled conditions in th e secondary market.  Following the Treasury 
announcement, option-adjusted spreads on agency MBS dropped substantially and 
reports indicated that some lenders lo wered rates on conforming mortgages around 
20 basis points. 
The very soft housing market has continued to weigh on mortgage credit quality.  Two 
national indexes, one published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
and the other by S&P/Case-Shiller, of existing home prices declined further in the second 
quarter, albeit not as sharply as in the previous quarter.  In June, the delinquency rate on

 prime (and near-prime) residential mortgage s edged up 10 basis points, to 1¾ percent, 
and the delinquency rate on subprime mortgage s increased about 45 basis points, to  
18¾ percent.  Preliminary data (not show n) indicate that th e delinquency rate on 
subprime variable-rate mortgages increased further in July.  
Issuance of MBS by Ginnie Mae continued to move up in July, while issuance by the 
GSEs that month was somewhat below the p ace earlier in the year.  No private-label 
MBS was issued that month.  In the second quart er, mortgage debt expanded at an annual 
rate below 1 percent, the slowest recorded pace since 1952.  The steep decline in total 
mortgage borrowing reflects a number of f actors, including th e tight supply of 
nonconforming loans, the rise in mortgage rates since the beginni ng of the year, the 
continuing drop in home prices, and sluggish home sales.   
Delinquency rates for revolving and nonrevol ving consumer loans at commercial banks 
edged up in the second quarter.  Delinquencie s on auto loans at the domestic captive 
finance companies remained elevated in July, and the charge-off rate on prime auto loans 
estimated by Moody’s (not shown) rose in June to its highest level since December 2003.   
Growth of consumer credit stepped down a lit tle in July.  Growth of nonrevolving credit 
slowed markedly, even as a large captive finance company launched aggressive auto 
financing incentives in July.  Since the A ugust FOMC meeting, interest rates on credit 
card and auto loans were little changed, genera lly remaining below the levels seen earlier 
this year.  Separately, new government-backed funding facilities appear to have largely 
assuaged concerns about the availability of student loans for the autumn semester.   The secondary market for consumer loans contin ues to show signs of strain.  Issuance of 
asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by credit card receivables and by auto loans 
was substantially weaker in July and August th an earlier this year.  Although issuance of 
student loan ABS has held up, on net, the A ugust figure reflected a single deal that was 
not widely distributed among investors.  Spreads on consumer ABS jumped in August 
and now stand above their March peaks, sugge sting that investors may have grown more 
concerned about the likely performance of the underlying loans.   As in July, long-term mutual funds saw sizable  outflows last month, which reflected large 
withdrawals from equity funds and moderate inflows to bond funds.  For the second 
consecutive month, money market funds attracted inflows exceeding $40 billion in 
August.

 Treasury Finance 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasur y conducted auctions of nominal coupon 
securities across a range of maturities, and th ese auctions were generally well received.  
Indirect bids, a rough measure of  demand from foreign official  institutions, stayed near 
the bottom of the range seen over the past several years.  However, foreign custody 
holdings of Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—another 
indicator of foreign demand—i ncreased notably over the intermeeting period, while such 
holdings of agency securities declined.     
Liquidity in the secondary market for Treas ury securities remained somewhat strained 
during the period.  Spreads between on- and o ff-the-run Treasury notes generally stayed 
elevated, an indication of c ontinued high demand for the most liquid securities.  In 
addition, fitting errors from the estimated nomi nal yield curve remained sizable; that is, 
there continued to be unusua lly large differences between yields on Treasury securities 
with similar maturities.  However, there we re some signs of improvement.  Average bid-
asked spreads for on-the-run nominal Treasury notes declined a bit further and now have 
nearly returned to levels seen before the onset of the financial turmoil last year, and trading volumes for on-the-run Treasury secu rities rebounded in early September from 
last month’s low level. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Issuance of long-term muni cipal bonds for both advan ce refundings and new capital 
projects was sizable in August.  Short-term  issuance was also str ong last month, a result 
of greater-than-typical revenue shortfa lls for state and local governments. 
Nonetheless, credit quality in the municipal bond sector appears to have remained solid 
on the whole, as the number of rating upgr ades continued to outpace the number of 
downgrades in the second quarter.  Yiel ds on long-term municipal bonds decreased 
slightly over the intermeeting period, even as those on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities moved down, pushing the ratio of a representative munici pal bond yield to a 
comparable-maturity Treasury yield to th e middle of this year’s elevated range. 
Money and Bank Credit M2 contracted at an annual rate of 1½ percent in August after ha ving expanded 6 percent 
in the previous month.  Smoothing through the monthly volatility, money growth has 
stepped down since the second quarter.  Th e August data showed a considerable 
reallocation among the components of M2.  Liqui d deposits and retail money funds fell at

2 Recent fluctuations in bank credit and its compone nts reflect larger-than- usual movements in the 
estimated seasonal factors.  The seasonal fact ors for recent months are difficult to estimate —particularly 
for commercial real estate loans —because of the timing of changes in  the panel of respondent banks. 
 
3 Because there are too few loans over $25 million, and their terms vary so widely, these loans are excluded 
from our analysis. annual rates of 8¼ percent and 5 percent, re spectively.  In stark contrast, small time 
deposits surged at a nearly 25 percent pace, as some banks and thrifts apparently 
continued to bid aggressively for these deposits to help stab ilize their core deposit base.  
Last month, growth of currency slowed from the robust pace in July that had reflected 
unusual demand from abroad.   
In July and August, commercial bank credit expanded at about the same pace as in the 
second quarter, as faster growth of securities holdings offset a slower expansion in loans.2  
Growth of commercial real estate and C&I loans was tepid, on average, during the July-August period, while residential real estate  loans and consumer loans on banks’ books 
grew at a pace similar to that in the second quarter. 
Data from the Survey of Terms of Busi ness Lending conducted during the week of 
August 4 indicated that the average spread on C&I loan originations of less than  
$25 million—adjusted for changes in nonpr ice loan characteristics—was about 
unchanged since the May survey.
3  The absence of a pronounced widening of yield 
spreads on those C&I loans is broadly consis tent with the recent NFIB survey, which 
showed that concerns among small firms a bout future credit conditions and current 
availability of credit have receded somewh at in recent months. By contrast, terms on 
large leveraged syndicated loans have remained very tight. 
Commercial bank profitability, as measured by industry return on assets, fell to about  
0.4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2008, th e lowest level since the end 
of 1990.  This year’s decrease has been somewhat more pronounced among the 25 largest 
institutions (as measured by assets), a segm ent of the industry in which a sharp increase 
in loan-loss provisions and la rge write-downs of asset valu es have weighed heavily on 
profits.  For the industry as a whole, loan-loss provisions increased to 1.3 percent of total 
loans and leases in the second quarter, about three times the y ear-earlier rate.  Despite the 
rapid pace of loan-loss provision ing, the ratio of loan-loss re serves to net charge-offs—a 
rough gauge of reserve adequacy—fell to a very low level.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $56.8 billion in June, as a large increase 
in exports of goods and services more than offset a more moderate increase in imports.   
 
  
 In June, exports rose 4 percent, supported by strength in exports of industrial supplies 
(
particularly petroleum products), agricultural products, and capital goods.  Exports of 
automotive products were pushed up by increased shipments of trucks to Canada, while 
strong exports of pharmaceutical products boosted consumer goods.  Exports of services 
also climbed.      
The value of exports in the second quarter increased 23¼ percent at an annual rate.  
Strong growth was recorded across most major categories; exports of industrial supplies 
and agricultural products were particularly robust.  In real terms, exports rose 13¼ 
percent in the second quarter, contributing 1.6 percentage points to U.S. real GDP 
growth.

  The value of imports of goods and services rose 1.8 percent in June, as a str ong increase 
in imports of oil (both on account of higher volumes as well as an increase in price) more 
than offset a sharp decline in non-oil goods.  Imports of capital goods fell, as computers 
slipped back after surging in May and other capital goods were weak.  Imports of 
consumer goods declined despite a jump in pharmaceutical products, whereas industrial 
supplies and automotive products were flat.  Services increased moderately. 
The value of imports in the second quarter increased 17½ percent at an annual rate, led by 
an increase in oil imports, as an increase in the price of imported oil more than offset a 
decline in the volume.  In real terms, however, imports contracted 7½ percent, resulting 
in a positive contribution to U.S. real GDP growth of 1.4 percentage points.  
Prices of Inter
nationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In July, for the second consecutive month, prices of core imports rose 
0.9 percent.  Compared with the June increase, July ’s rise  featured a relatively large 
contribution from finished goods, mostly reflecting a 0.8 percent increase in the prices for 
capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors.  Prices for consumer goods also 
accelerated, increasing 0.3 percent in July following 0.1 percent in June.  As in previous 
months most of the increase in the prices of core goods was due to material-intensive 
goods; prices for these goods increased 1.8 percent in July following 2.4 percent in June. 
Higher prices for chemicals and steel and iron products more than offset falling prices for 
nonferrous metals.  Higher prices for meat and vegetables also contributed to the 
increase.   
Oil.
  The BLS price index for imported oil rose 4 percent in July, amid considerable 
volatility in underlying s
pot prices.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) 
crude oil surged to $145 per barrel in mid July but then reversed course, leaving the 
monthly average price for July unchanged from June’s $133 per barrel.  Oil pr ices have 
fallen from an average of $117 in August to $103.26 as of September 9.  The rapid fall in 
oil prices that has occurred since mid-July appears to reflect a continued weakening of 
the outlook for global oil demand as well as increases in supply.  Part of this increase 
stems from Saudi Arabia, which raised crude production for the third consecutive month.     
IV-5 
 
IV-6 
 
IV-7 
 This apparent easing of the global oil balance has more than offset any upward price 
pressure stemming from increased geopolitical tensions due to the conflict between 
Russia and Georgia, as well as tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Exports.   Core export prices rose 1.9 percent in July.  Almost all of the increase was due 
to higher prices for material-intensive goods.  Prices for agricultural products soared 
6.7 percent in July, reflecting sharp price increases for corn and soybeans.  Prices for 
nonagricultural industrial supplies rose 2.6 percent, supported by higher prices for fuels 
and chemicals.  After increasing 0.1 percent in June, prices for finished goods rose 
0.3 percent in July.

r slowing sharply in the second half of 2007, foreign official flows into the United 
States surged during the first half of 2008 (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Financial Tr
ansactions table and the chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows ).  As 
market attention increasingly focused on concerns about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
official investors slightly reduced their holdings of agency securities in July.  However, 
these outflows from agency securities were more than 
offset by inflows into Treasury and other short-term 
securities.  All told, foreign official inflows were on 
trend in July, registering $41 billion, with nearly all 
com
ing from China, Russia, and members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  
Data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that 
official holdings of agency securities continued to 
decline through early September, even as holdings of 
Treasuries continued to rise (see inset chart).  In the 
two days foll
owing the announcement that Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac would be placed into 
conservatorship, foreign official holdings of agency 
securities at FRBNY increased slightly, but it is too 
early to tell if this signals a return to previous trends.     
Foreign pr
ivate net purchases of U.S. securities have continued to slow since the financial 
turmoil began in m
id-2007 and were weak in the first half of 2008, averaging about half 
of those recorde
d in the second half of 2007 (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International 
Financial Transactions table; 
see also the chart on Private Securities Flows).  Foreign 
private investors hav
e been selling agency bonds since March, but the pace accelerated in 
July to a record $51 bi
llion (line 4b).  There were also small outflows from net foreign 
private sales of corporate and municipal bonds and corporate stocks (lines 4c and 4d), but 
these were mostly offset by net purchases of Treasury securities (line 4a).  Overall, 
private foreign net sales of U.S. securities in July resulted in a record outflow of $53 
billion (line 4).   
IV-9 
Since early 2007, financial outflows associated with U.S. private investors’ net 
acquisitions of foreign securities have been decreasing on average (bottom left panel of 
the chart).  In July U.S. private investors sold, on net, $30 billion of foreign securities 
(line 5), which resulted in an inflow.   
 
 The volatil
e banking sector (line 3) registered an inflow of $21 billion in June, which was 
followed by a large outflow of $83 billion in July.  Most of the outflow in July was due to 
decreased funding from affiliated branches in the Caribbean.   
Complete U.S. balance of payments data for the second quarter will not be published 
until September 17.  However, some partial data have come in, including changes in 
quarterly reported custody holdings.  These data (which will be included in line 10 of the 
table) indicate a further $50 billion in inflows during the second quarter, primarily the 
result of a decrease in U.S. residents’ deposits in the Caribbean.

Foreign Financial Markets 
The dollar has appreciated sharply since the time of the last Greenbook in accordance 
with the deterioration of the foreign economic outlook.  The major currencies index 
increased by 6½ percent, with the dollar gaining over 12 percent against sterling and 10 
percent against the euro after the release of weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data 
for Europe and the news of downward adjustments to the growth forecasts of the Bank of 
England (BoE), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD).  The appreciation of the dollar against the yen 
has been modest.   
 
 Despite gloomier growth expectations, the BoE and the ECB left their policy rates 
unchanged over the period, citing concerns about inflation being well above target.  
Medium-term policy expectations have declined, however, since the July/August 
Greenbook, especially for the Bank of England.  The twelve month sterling overnight 
index swap (OIS) rate has declined by 44 basis points.  The comparable euro rate 
declined only 17 basis points amid statements by several ECB Governing Council 
Members that some of these expectations are premature due to continued inflationary 
pressures.  In line with expected easing by central banks, sovereign bond yields have 
declined since the end of July, reflecting declines both in real rates and in expected 
inflation.  Ten-year inflation compensation has declined by roughly 20 basis points in the 
euro area and 10 basis points in the United Kingdom.  Inflation compensation in Japan 
has declined as well, by 15 basis points.   
Conditions in money markets deteriorated somewhat since the time of the last 
Greenbook.  Spreads between three-month sterling Libor and OIS rates increased by 11 
basis points, likely driven at least in part by the worsening economic outlook for the 
United Kingdom.  U.K. housing prices have continued to fall, and Moody’s downgraded 
$3.6 billion of nonconforming U.K. residential mortgage-backed securities in August due 
to rising delinquencies.  The United Kingdom’s financial regulator, the Financial 
Services Authority, also fined Credit Suisse for incorrect securities valuations in mid-
August and announced that next year it will start probing “a large number” of London 
banks for similar problems.  Euro Libor to OIS spreads increased only modestly.  The 
demand for dollar funding in continental Europe still appears to be substantial.  The 
initial 84-day U.S. dollar auctions of the ECB and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), held 
in conjunction with the 84-day Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions by the Federal 
Reserve, were substantially oversubscribed.  The ECB and SNB also held three 28-day 
auctions during the period, and these drew substantial bids as well.  On concern that some 
IV-14 
European financial institutions might be taking advantage of the ECB’s broad collateral 
rules, the ECB announced several changes to its rules.  These changes are scheduled to 
take effect in February 2009. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Apparently reflecting the same concerns about weakening growth abroad that boosted the 
major currencies index of the dollar, the dollar rose nearly 4 percent against the 
currencies of our other important trading partners.  Currencies throughout the emerging 
markets declined, most notably the Brazilian real and the Korean won, which are 13¾ 
percent and 8¼ percent lower against the dollar, respectively, since the previous 
Greenbook.  The renminbi, however, depreciated only modestly against the dollar.  These 
depreciations occurred in spite of the fact that the central banks of Indonesia, Israel, 
Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam tightened policy in an attempt to curb 
mounting inflation.  A number of countries, including Russia, Korea, and Indonesia, are 
believed to have intervened in foreign exchange markets to support their currencies in the 
face of downward pressures. 
Despite the fact that stock markets rallied after the Treasury Department’s actions 
regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, equity prices around the world have, on net, 
declined since the July/August Greenbook.  The Dow Jones Eurostoxx index declined by 
2½ percent whereas the Nikkei index lost over 7 percent.  The Shanghai composite index 
fell by as much as 24 percent.  Financial stocks in the euro area have risen slightly over 
this period.  European banks reported second-quarter write-downs totaling around $40 
billion, although earnings reports in early August were better than had been expected.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Economic indicators received since the last Greenbook point to marked deterioration in 
the pace of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies.  Second-quarter GDP 
was flat in Canada and the United Kingdom and fell in both Japan and the euro area.  The 
weakness in the advanced foreign economies appears to have continued into the third 
quarter.  Confidence and survey indicators declined considerably in recent months in 
most of these economies.  In July, employment continued to weaken in Japan, and retail 
sales fell in the euro area and decelerated in the United Kingdom.  Headline inflation in 
the major advanced foreign economies stayed elevated, although it edged down in August 
in the euro area.  Since the last Greenbook, inflation excluding food and energy was 
generally little changed for the major economies.  No major central bank changed its 
policy rate during the intermeeting period.  
IV-21 
 
IV-22 
 
 
 
 
 In Japan , real GDP contracted 2.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter following a 
downward-revised growth rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter.  All major components 
of domestic demand except government consumption fell sharply.  Private consumption 
declined almost 2 percent, and private investment contracted more than 2½ percent.  Net 
exports also made a small negative contribution to growth. 
For t
he third quarter, trade data suggest a rebound in net exports.  After falling sharply 
earlier in the year, real exports grew steadily in May, June, and July, while real imports 
were up only slightly over the same period.  Elsewhere in the economy, recent data point 
to continued weakness.  Industrial production rose only 0.8 percent over the 12 months 
ending in July, well below the 2.2 percent in the previous 12 months.  Business and 
consumer confidence indicators have deteriorated sharply over the last year and are both 
at or near their 2001 lows. 
The labor market has continued to weaken.  Although the unemployment rate fell back 
0.1 percentage point to 4.0 percent in July, the job openings- to-applicants ratio (the 
number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered 
job seekers) declined to 0.89, its lowest level since October 20 04.  
IV-23 
 
 Rising energy and food prices have been the primary reason for a 2.3 percent increase in 
Japanese consumer prices over the 12 months ending in Ju ly.  Consumer prices excluding 
fresh food (Japan’s official definition of core inflation) rose nearly as much, but prices 
excluding food and energy were up only 0.2 percent from last year.  The timelier 
12-month core CPI inflation for Tokyo slowed from 1.6 percent in July to 1.3 percent  in 
August.  
On August 29, the Japanese government announced a $106 billion stimulus package in 
response to the weakening economy.  Although details remain sketchy, the bulk of the 
stimulus is likely to be allotted to loan guarantees to small and medium-sized enterprises.   
However, the stimulus is likely too small to have a substantial impact on Japan's 
economy.  Japan's Prime Minister Fukuda announced his resignation on September 1 in 
an effort to break political deadlock.  His party, the Liberal Democratic Party, has called 
an election for September 22. 
IV-24 
 
IV-25 
 
 
 Euro-area  real GDP contracted 0.8 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, with larger-than-
expected declines in France, Italy, and particularly Germany.  A collapse in investment 
was the main factor behind the second-quarter weakness.  Private consumption also 
posted a decline, partially offset by gains in government consumption.  The most recent 
ECB bank lending survey indicates credit standards in the euro area remained tight in the 
second quarter, mainly reflecting deteriorating expectations about the euro-area economic 
outlook. 
Recent
 indicators point to continued softness in the third quarter.  Euro-area economic 
sentiment dropped further in August, reaching its lowest level in over five years.  
Purchasing managers’ indexes  (PMIs) for both manufacturing and services in August 
indicated that these sectors contracted for the third consecutive month.  Retail sales 
declined 0.4 percent in July.  Particularly worrisome is the clear deterioration in the 
German economy, which had shown resilience until recently.  The German Ifo business 
climate index dropped in August for the third consecutive month, the manufacturing PMI 
fell below 50, and manufacturing new orders have been decreasing sharply in recent 
months. 
IV-26 
Euro-area 12-month headline inflation, as measured by the harmonized index of 
consumer prices (HICP), reached 4 percent in July, a record high.  Excluding energy and 
unprocessed food, inflation continued to hover around 2½ percent.  According to a 
preliminary estimate, headline inflation edged down to 3.8 percent in August.  The ECB 
Council left its policy rate unchanged at 4.25 percent at its August and September 
meetings. 
IV-27 
 
IV-28 
 
 
 
 In the United Kingdom , growth of real GDP in the second quarter was revised down to a 
meager 0.2 percent (a.r.), held down by flat consumption and plunging housing and 
gover
nment investment.  The fall in domestic demand was offset by positive 
contributions from net exports and inventories.  Recent data point to further weakness in 
the third quarter.  In July, retail sales stood below their second-quarter level, the 
claim-based measure of the unemployment rate edged up, and industrial production 
continued to fall.  Confidence indicators have weakened, on balance, since the last 
Greenbook to very low levels. 
On Septe
mber 2, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a one-year suspension of 
taxes on housing transactions of £175,000 or less, a measure that will cost the 
government an estimated £600 million.  The Chancellor also brought forward £1 billion 
in spending to fund a series of measures aimed at accelerating public housing 
construction, encouraging first-time buyers, and assisting families facing repossession.  
House price indexes fell more than 10 percent in the year to August, and the value of 
loans for house purchases in July was only a quarter of its year-earlier level. 
IV-29 
The 12-month rate of headline inflation climbed to 4.4 percent in July.  Food and energy 
prices, the largest contributors to the run up in inflation, rose 10 percent and 21 percent, 
respectively, over the same period.  Although inflation outside of energy and both 
processed and unprocessed food crept up in recent months, it remained contained at 
1.9 percent.  Average earnings, both including and excluding bonuses, st ood about 
3½ percent higher in July than 12 months earlier. 
IV-30 
 
IV-31 
 
 
 
 In Canada , real GDP rose a tepid 0.3 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, after a 
downward-revised fall of 0.8 percent in the first quarter.  Second-quarter GDP was 
restrained by a large negative contribution from net exports (2.8 percentage points), as 
exports – particularly to the United States – continued to fall sharply.  Investment also 
fell, partly reflecting a decline in residential construction.  In contrast, consumption 
growth was strong, at 2.4 percent, although half of its 2007 pace. 
Foll
owing a loss of 55 thousand jobs in July, employment increased 15 thousand in 
August.  Since the start of the year, employment has grown 0.5 percent, a much smaller 
increase compared to the first eight months of 2007.  The unemployment rate remained 
unchanged at 6.1 percent. 
The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation rose to 3.3 percent in July, up from 
1.4 percent in March, reflecting escalating energy prices and an end to the extremely low 
rates of food-price inflation over the past year.  The Bank of Canada’s preferred measure 
of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components of the consumer 
price index as well as the effects of indirect taxes, remained muted at 1.5 percent.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Data since the July/August Greenbook generally have showed continued slowing in 
emerging market economies.  Revised data for Mexico indicate that real GDP contracted 
in the first quarter and that growth was quite low in the second quarter as well.  In Asia, 
second-quarter output contracted sharply in Hong Kong and Singapore, and decelerated 
significantly in India, Malaysia, and Thailand.  However, in a few countries, including 
the Philippines, Indonesia, and Venezuela, output rebounded from below-trend rates in 
the first quarter.  In the current quarter, emerging market economies appear to have 
continued to grow at a subdued pace, weighed down by weak external sectors and 
varying degrees of weakness in domestic demand. 
Headline inflation in the developing world may be beginning to crest.  Although inflation 
rose in some countries, it fell in several Asian economies including China, Korea, 
Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.  Inflation in Mexico edged just a touch higher in July.  
Monetary authorities in several emerging market economies, including Korea and 
Mexico, have raised policy rates since the time of the July/August Greenbook. 
In China , data thus far in the third quarter have been mixed.  In July, industrial 
production contracted and bank lending expanded at about its second-quarter pace, which 
was the lowest since 2006.  On the other hand, the trade balance has jumped higher to 
average about $310 billion at an annual rate over July and August, well above the 
second-quarter average, as exports rebounded and imports contracted.  Exports were 
higher to all regions including the United States.  In addition, retail sales were up more 
than 23 percent from a year earlier. 
In August, 12-month consumer price inflation fell to 4.9 percent, down from more than 
8 percent early in the year, as food price inflation continued to wane.  Excluding food and 
energy, inflation has remained subdued at a little over 1 percent.  With headline inflation 
coming down, authorities have issued statements indicating a shifting of concern away 
from inflation and towards slowing growth.  Thus far, the authorities have taken limited 
actions aimed at aiding the export sector.  For example, in early August, China increased 
tax rebates for textile and clothing exporters.  Monetary authorities have also reportedly 
raised banks’ lending quotas 5 pe rcent, with the new funds to be directed toward small 
and medium-sized enterprises. 
IV-34 
 
 
 India’s  GDP growth fell in the second quarter to 5½ percent from 9 percent in the first.  
The slowdown reflected, in part, the response of domestic demand to three consecutive 
interest rate increases by the authorities.  Growth also slowed in agriculture and the 
export-oriented services sector.  Industrial production in the second quarter was flat.  
Both consumer and wholesale price inflation increased in July, although the pickup in 
wholesale price inflation was small compared with recent months.  On August 14, the 
government announced a 28 percent increase in employee salaries, which will likely 
stimulate consumption but also increase inflation pressures.  Imports grew faster than 
exports in July, and the trade deficit widened considerably relative to the first and second 
quarters.

1 Newly industrialized economies: Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan In the  NIEs1, second-quarter growth slowed in Taiwan and contracted in both Hong 
Kong and Singapore.  The slowing in Taiwan was broad-based and reflected weaker 
domestic and external demand.  The same was true in Hong Kong, only to a greater 
extent, with output falling 5½ percent.  Activity contracted 6 percent in Singapore, due in 
part to the volatile biomedical sector, but electronics also slowed, and a decline in 
government expenditures weighed on domestic demand.  In July, industrial production 
edged lower in Korea and showed a sharp contraction in Taiwan.  In contrast, production 
in Singapore rebounded in July.  Trade balances worsened in July except in Singapore, 
with Korean and Taiwanese balances moving from a surplus to a deficit. 
12-month consumer price inflation remained elevated in Hong Kong, largely reflecting 
higher food and energy prices.  In Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, there are some 
indications that headline inflation may have peaked.  Korean inflation jumped to 
5.9 percent in July but moved down to 5.6 percent in August on lower energy prices.  On 
August 5, the Korean central bank raised its official rate 25 basis points, the first increase 
in a year, in order to contain inflation, which remains well above the country’s target.   
12-month inflation fell about 1 percentage point in Singapore in July and fell about the 
same in Taiwan in August.

 In the ASEAN-4, real GDP growth in the second quarter slowed markedly in Malaysia 
and Thai
land, but growth rebounded from slow first quarters in Indonesia and the 
Philippines.  In July, industrial production in Thailand was flat, and the trade balance 
swung from a surplus to a sizable deficit.  Indonesia’s trade surplus also narrowed in 
July. 
Consumer price inflation rose significantly in all of the ASEAN countries in July, 
reaching about 12 percent on a 12-month basis in Indonesia and the Philippines.  In 
August, inflation in Indonesia and the Philippines was little changed but Thailand 
recorded a sharp drop, which was primarily due to increased government subsidies on 
energy.  Similarly, Malaysian authorities cut retail fuel prices a bit in August to quiet 
political unrest ignited by a massive fuel price hike in June.  To combat high inflation, the 
central banks of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand raised interest rates in August. 
The political environment in Thailand deteriorated rapidly in late August and early 
September.  T he Thailand Election Committee found that the ruling People’s Power Party 
committed election fraud in the December elections.  Following increased anti-
government demonstrations, Prime Minister Sundaravej declared a state of emergency, 
which allows the military more leeway to contain rioting in the capital.

 In Mexico , real GDP growth in the first quarter was revised sharply lower, from about 
2 percent to -½ percent, and output remained anemic in the second quarter, rising only 
0.6 percent.  Manufacturing, mining, utilities, and the construction sector all contracted in 
the second quarter.  Retail sales slowed as employment fell and real disposable income 
deteriorated owing to the rise in consumer prices.  In July, the trade deficit widened as 
import growth outweighed the increase in exports.  Although overall exports increased in 
July, there was a significant contraction in automobile exports.   
Headline and core inflation continued to increase in July, with both measures higher than 
5 percent on a 12-month basis.  With inflation above its 4 percent target, the Bank of 
Mexico raised its policy rate ¼ percentage point in mid-August, bringing the rate to 
8¼ percent.  This increase was the third consecutive one.    
IV-43 
 
 
 In Brazil , second-quarter real GDP rose 6½ percent following an upward-revised 
3.4 percent increase in the first quarter.  Consumption was robust, up 4.2 percent, while 
gross fixed capital formation soared 23 percent.  Net exports posted a neutral contribution 
to growth, with both exports and imports rebounding after a weak first quarter when trade 
was depressed by a customs strike.  Rapid growth in credit and rising incomes from high 
commodity prices continued to boost domestic demand.  Headline consumer price 
inflation declined in August to 6.2 percent on a 12-month basis, driven in part by falling 
food prices.   
In Argentina , industrial production recovered in the second quarter, and it increased 
sharply in July following a resolution to the conflict between farmers and the government 
over a proposal to tax exports; the conflict subsided after the Congress rejected the export 
tax bill.  The trade surplus narrowed in the second quarter, in part reflecting a 
strike-related fall in exports, but widened in July.  The financial condition of the 
government, however, has deteriorated.  The government borrowed $1 billion from 
Venezuela at a rate 2 percentage points higher than the average of its current outstanding 
debt, signaling that the government faces difficulty issuing new bonds at competitive 
rates in international markets.  In addition, Standard and Poor ’s downgraded Argentina’s 
sovereign debt rating to B from B+.  To restore credibility, the government announced 
that it would use some of its international reserves to pay off $6.7 billion of Paris Club 
debt, which has been in default since the 2001 -02 economic crisis.  Headline consumer 
price inflation remained around 9 percent in July on a 12-month basis, but the reliability 
of
 the official inflation data remains questionable. 
IV-44 
 
 
In Venezuela , second-quarter real GDP rebounded following a large first-quarter decline.  
Output rose at an annual rate of 14 percent, despite a contraction in the volatile petroleum 
sector of 7 percent.  Headline inflation continued to be very high, coming in at more than 
33 percent on a 12-month basis in August.  The bolivar declined 20 percent against the 
dollar in the parallel market over the second half of August.  A number of developments 
appear to have contributed to the currency drop.  These include the government takeover 
of Mexican-owned cement company Sidor and the announcement that the government 
will acquire Banco de Venezuela, the country’s third largest bank (whose Spanish owners 
had been looking for a buyer)  Also, in early August, the Chavez-appointed Supreme 
Court ruled as constitutional the disqualification of roughly 300 opposition candidates 
from the upcoming November local elections.

 Tensions remain high in Russia , after the invasion of Georgia in mid-August.  In early 
August, Georgia attempted to regain control over the breakaway region of South Ossetia 
by force.  The Russian response was to send its own troops to this region and to 
neighboring Abakhazia, also a separatist province, and then continue into the heart of 
Georgia to occupy strategic military locations.  The military conflict and political 
tensions have exacerbated concerns about the investment climate in Russia and stoked 
worries within the EU about the reliability of Russia as a source of energy.  Over several 
days in August and September, the Russian authorities intervened to support the ruble.  
As a result, international reserves fell about $14 billion in August.  Despite the 
intervention, the ruble has depreciated about 10 percent against the dollar since end-July.  
The Russian stock market has been on a downward trend since May.  Inflation remains 
uncomfortably high, coming in at a 12-month rate of nearly 15 percent in August.  
Falling oil prices and rising interest rates could weigh on activity in the future.      
In Pakistan , the economic situation is precarious.  An overheating of the economy, 
together with the sharp rise in world oil and other commodity prices, took 12-month 
inflation to nearly 25 percent in July.  In its latest monetary policy report, the State Bank 
of Pakistan estimates that the government fiscal deficit rose sharply to about 8 percent of 
GDP in fiscal year 2007-08 (which runs from July to June), and the current account 
deficit rose to about 8½ percent of GDP.  Until recently, sufficiently high capital inflows 
easily financed the current account deficit, but with intense political uncertainty since late 
last year, investor sentiment has turned against the country.  The Pakistani rupee has 
moved sharply down against the dollar since last October, and there has been a massive 
loss of international reserves resulting from efforts to prevent a free-fall of the currency; 
reserves are at a critically low level.  President Musharraf resigned in mid-August under 
pressure from the new ruling coalition, but the coalition broke up soon after his 
resignation.  In early September, Mr. Zardari (the husband of the assassinated 
Ms. Bhutto) was elected President.  There does not appear to be a quick end in sight to 
political uncertainty, security problems, and severe economic difficulties.
