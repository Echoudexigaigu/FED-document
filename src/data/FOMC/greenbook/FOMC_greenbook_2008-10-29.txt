Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
The spending and production data that we have received since the September Greenbook 
have been almost uniformly dour.  Consumer  outlays fell precipitously, weighed down by 
stagnant real income, tightening credit, de clining household wealt h, and concerns about 
the overall health of the economy.  The housi ng market remained exceptionally weak as 
construction activity continued its steep decl ine and the pace of new home sales eroded 
further over the summer.  In the business se ctor, fundamentals turned more negative; 
spending on equipment and software looks to  have decreased for a third consecutive 
quarter, and nonresidential c onstruction outside of the drilling and mining category 
decelerated noticeably.  In the labor market, private employment in September fell faster 
than earlier in the year, while the unemploy ment rate remained at 6.1 percent, after 
having jumped nearly ½ percentage point in August.  Regarding inflation, falling energy 
prices held down headline PCE inflation in  August and September.  After having risen 
more rapidly earlier in the summer, core PCE prices also decelerated over the past two months. 
Labor Market Developments  
Conditions in the labor market deteriorated  further in September.  Private nonfarm 
payroll employment fell 168,000, a noticeably larg er decline than the average pace of job 
loss over the first eight months of the year.
1  Manufacturing and the related temporary 
help industry continued to pos t sizable losses, as did the construction industry.  Retail 
trade and financial services sa w greater declines in employ ment than over the previous 
few months, while nonbusiness services, whic h include education and health services, 
continued to add jobs last month, but at the slowest pace this year. 
The average workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers ticked down 0.1 hour 
in September, and aggregate hours of productio n workers fell ½ percent.  For the third 
quarter as a whole, production worker hours fell at an annual rate of 2 percent after an 
average decline of about  1 percent in the firs t half of the year. 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te held steady at 6.1 percent last month 
after rising more than a percenta ge point between April and August.2  Another indicator 
of labor market slack, the fraction of work ers who are working part time for economic 
                                                 
1 The employment figures for September do not appear to have been significan tly affected by either 
Hurricanes Gustav or Ike or the strike at Boeing.  Separately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
announced the preliminary estimate for the annual benc hmark revision to be incorporated into the payroll 
figures next February.  The BLS estimates that the level of private payroll employment in March 2008 will be revised down by 81,000 or 0.1 percent, a small revision by historical standards.  
2 We estimate that the unemployment rate was boosted by about 0.3 percentage point in August and 
September by the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program.

reasons, rose further in September and now st ands 1 percentage point  above its level at 
the end of last year.  The labor force part icipation rate moved down to 66 percent last 
month but has changed little, on net, thus far this year. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance under 
regular state programs has risen steeply si nce mid-September, boosted by filings after 
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.  However, even after subtracting the De partment of Labor’s 
estimate of hurricane-related claims, th e four-week average moved up about 6,000 over 
the past month to 446,000 for the week ending October 11.  Insured unemployment 
(continuing claims) continued to  rise through early October, with some of this increase 
also reflecting the effects of the hurricanes.  Both the rise in insured unemployment and 
the continued high level of cl aims are consistent with a nother substantial decline in 
employment in October. Additional measures of job separations—the  short-term job losers rate from the 
household survey and the layoffs and discharg es rate, as measured by the Job Openings 
and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)—have crep t up, on balance, in recent months.  In 
addition, announcements of downsizing plans compiled by Challenger, Gray, and 
Christmas, Inc. remained somewhat elevated in September. 
Other labor market indicators suggest that  jobs are in short supply.  The JOLTS job 
openings rate continued on its downward trajectory in August, and help-wanted 
advertising fell again in September.  Both the measure of positions hard-to-fill and the measure of hiring plans in the National Fe deration of Independent Business’s survey 
remained low in September, as did percep tions of current job availability in the 
Conference Board survey. 
According to the Reuters/University of Mi chigan survey, household expectations for 
labor market conditions deteri orated markedly in early October, which reversed the 
improvement seen over the summer. 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) plunge d 2.8 percent (monthly rate ) in September, although 
nearly the entire decline was due to the e ffects of the recent hurricanes and the ongoing 
machinists’ strike at Boeing.  For the third quar ter as a whole, IP fell at an annual rate of 
6 percent, with about two-thirds of the dr op reflecting these special factors.  Energy 
producers bore the brunt of the hurricanes, and production in that industry has not yet 
fully recovered.  As of October 21, roughly 40 percent of both crude oil and natural gas 
extraction capacity in the Gulf of Mexico re mained offline.  In contrast, the effect on

non-energy producers, most notably  petrochemical producers, a ppears to have been short-
lived, with many reports suggesting produc tion disruptions of  about one week. 
In manufacturing, production fell  at an annual rate of 5¾ perc ent last quarter, with more 
than one-half of the decline attributable to the special factors.  Nonetheless, the three-
month manufacturing IP diffu sion index indicates that a majority of industries 
experienced declining output .  The factory operating rate sank to 74.5 percent in 
September, more than 5 percentage  points below its 1972–2007 average. 
The output of high-tech products rose at an annual rate of just 6 percent in the third 
quarter after rising at an aver age pace of 20 percent during th e first half of the year.  
Output gains for both computers and comm unication equipment slowed, and anecdotal 
information suggests that tight credit ma rket conditions held down demand for these 
products.  A major producer of communicati ons equipment reported that orders have 
fallen off noticeably, and private-sector forecasts for corporate spending on computers, 
particularly by financial companies, have b ecome dimmer.  Moreover, sales of personal 
computers at retail outlets are reportedly weaker  than would typically be expected at this 
time of year. 
Further up the high-tech supply chain, the out put of semiconductors decelerated during 
the third quarter, as the pr oduction of memory chips and microprocessor units (MPUs) 
declined.  Looking forward, near-term indicators have been gloomy.  Revenue guidance 
from Intel Corporation suggests that the pr oduction of MPUs will decline in the fourth 
quarter.  In addition, other companies have b een slashing prices on memory chips to clear 
excess inventories.  Moreover, orders for ci rcuit boards have con tinued to decline and 
remain below shipments.  Several industry groups, including iS uppli and SEMI, have 
sharply cut their forecasts for capital e xpenditures by semiconductor companies in 2009, 
citing the glut of memory chips and problems in financial markets. 
Manufacturing production excluding high tech, motor vehicles, and aircraft declined in 
the third quarter, and the wea kness was broad based.  Looking forward, recent readings 
on new orders suggest that the pace of production would likely decline further in coming months absent the expected  hurricane-related rebound.  Th e staff’s measure of real 
adjusted durable goods orders fell abruptly in August, and the new orders diffusion index from the Institute for Supply Management (IS M) plunged in September to a low that has 
been reached only three times since the early  1980s.  In addition, both the Empire State 
Manufacturing Survey and the Philadelphia Business Outlook Survey reported sharp declines in their orders indexes for Octobe r.  Moreover, after having boosted domestic

production considerably over the past year, de mand from abroad appears to be slowing; 
the ISM export orders index declined sharply in September, and, while still above 50, it 
was well below the levels seen earlier this year. 
The industrial slowdown has not been confined to the United States.  The JPMorgan 
Global New Orders Index—constructed from surveys of purchasing managers in 26 
countries—sank further below 50 in Septembe r, consistent with declining industrial 
production among many of the Un ited States’ major trading partners.  Given the 
increased use of globally inte grated supply chains, the dr op in the Global New Orders 
Index may both reflect and portend weakness in U.S. manufacturing. 
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of automobiles and light trucks tumbled 1¼ million units at an annual rate in 
September, back down to their July pace of 12½ million units.   
.3 
Early reports suggest that sale s continued to slump in October.  Our contacts at the 
Detroit Three expect total light vehicle sale s this month to run well below September’s 
pace, and sales of the major Japanese namepl ates were very weak through the first 20 
days of this month.  Anec dotal reports suggest that buyers may have encountered 
considerable financing difficulties this m onth.  The Reuters/Michigan index of car-
buying attitudes dropped in the first half of Oc tober, and the percent of respondents who 
felt that it was a bad time to buy because “i nterest rates were hi gh or credit is tight” 
surged to a level not seen since 1982.  Indeed, GM and Ford reported that they had substantially cut back their leasing programs.
4  And GMAC—which is jointly owned by 
GM and Cerberus Capital Management—announced  that it would provide financing only  
to the most credit worthy individuals and that it would extend fewer longer-term loans. 
Because of worries about the impact of the GMAC announcement, both GM and Ford 
began efforts around mid-month to try to assure  potential buyers th at their dealerships 
could help consumers obtain fi nancing for their purchases. 
Turning to production, light motor vehicle assemblies were unchanged in the third 
quarter at an annual rate of 8.5 million units.  Relative to initial schedules, last quarter’s 
underbuild was 18 percent, compared with an average third-quarter underbuild of 
4 percent.  Despite the low level of production last quarter, days’ suppl y of light vehicles

has been moving up, on balance, throughout the year; at September’s sales pace, dealers 
held an uncomfortably high 78 days supply at the end of last month.  Automakers’ 
schedules currently call for light vehicle asse mblies to move up a touch this quarter; at 
the current sales pace, these sc hedules, if maintained, woul d imply no improvement in the 
inventory situation. 
Consumer Spending  
The available data suggest that consumer sp ending declined in September for the fourth 
consecutive month.  For the third quarter as a whole, real personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) appear to have fallen sharply, with the cutbacks extending well beyond vehicle purchases.  We estimate that real purchases of goods other than motor 
vehicles fell at an annual rate of nearly 7 pe rcent last quarter, the sharpest decrease for 
this category since 1980.  Data on services spending lag the indicators of goods purchases 
by a month, but the most recent readings have  not been encouraging.  Real outlays for 
services were flat, on balance, in July and August, and excluding the volatile energy 
component, real spending was up just a touch over the two months.  Early indicators of 
October spending, including weekly chain stor e sales, suggest that demand has continued 
to deteriorate. 
The headwinds facing consumers have been in tensifying.  Real incomes have stagnated 
recently:  Taken together, the September labo r market report and the latest readings on 
consumer prices suggest that  real labor income fell last  month, and, excluding the tax 
rebates and transfers related to the Emer gency Unemployment Compensation program, 
real disposable income in July and Augus t was little changed, on average, from its 
second-quarter level.  In addition, credit c onditions have tightened, and the recent steep 
drop in the stock market and the continuing de cline in house prices ha ve further strained 
households’ balance sheets.  Likely reflec ting these developments, the preliminary 
reading from the Reuters/University of Michig an survey of consumer sentiment in early 
October moved back down to near the recessionary low recorded in June. On the credit-supply side, preliminary data  from the October Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey (SLOOS) on Bank Lending Practices  indicate that, on net, about half of 
domestic banks reported they were less willi ng to make consumer installment loans over 
the past three months than in the prior th ree-month period, and about 60 percent indicated 
they had tightened credit standards on both credit card loans and other consumer loans 
(see the appendix to the “Domestic Financial Developments” section).  Total consumer 
credit declined in August for the first time in  a decade.  Although the drop may have been 
due, in part, to households using their tax reba tes to pay down balances, a large portion of

the drop probably reflected the tightened  borrowing conditions and a precautionary 
pullback in spending. 
Housing  
Housing activity continued its steep descent in  the third quarter.  In September, single-
family housing starts fell nearly 12 percent to an annual rate of 544,000 units, and 
adjusted permit issuance—a useful month-ahea d indicator of starts —dropped to a similar 
level.  So far this year, single-family starts have fallen at an annual rate of 38 percent, the 
same rate of decline as in 2007.  Multifamily starts edged up to 273,000 units in 
September but remained toward the lower end of the range occupied over the past two years. 
Housing demand remains very weak.  The Census Bureau’s measure of new single-
family home sales fell nearly 12 percent in August and has declin ed at a 33 percent 
annual rate so far this year.  More recen tly, sales agreements at medium and large 
homebuilders—which currently represent abou t a third of overall new home sales—fell 
close to 12 percent in September accordi ng to the National Association of Home 
Builders.  The number of unsold new single-family homes continued to move lower in 
August.  However, inventories remained extr emely elevated relative to the current pace 
of sales, as the months’ supply of new homes stood at more than double its average prior to the recent housing market downturn. 
Sales of existing single-family ho mes, which are registered at closing rather than when an 
agreement is signed, moved down a bit in August, though the jump in August pending 
home sales suggests a rebound in the near term.  Since the end of last year, existing home 
sales have changed little, on balance, but the pace of sales in recent months likely has been boosted by increases in foreclosure-relate d sales.  Foreclosures often transfer the 
ownership of homes to banks or other mort gage holders, and these institutions, which 
typically do not hold real esta te on their balance sheets, tend to price houses to sell 
relatively quickly.  According to the National Association of  Realtors, 35 percent to 40 
percent of recently surveyed Rea ltors reported their latest tran saction to have been either 
a short sale or a sale resulting from foreclos ure, and the Realtors have suggested that 
recent sales increases—and outsized price d eclines—in parts of California and Florida

5 Foreclosure proceedings generally provide for a public auction of the foreclosed  property.  Sales from 
such auctions would not be captured in existing home sales figures.  However, when, as is now often the 
case, the value of a home is less than the amount owed on the mortgage, auctions often result in ownership of the property being transferred to the mortgage holder (typically a bank), which may hire a real estate agent to sell the property.  These sales would then be captured in the existing home sales data.

Q2Price of New Homes
II-19 
After having fallen in September, rates fo r conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages 
moved back up about 35 basis points over the fi rst half of October to around 6½ percent 
at midmonth.  Meanwhile, the market for nonconforming loans (that is, loans that cannot 
be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) has remained severely impaired.  Although 
increased lending through the Federal Housi ng Administration (FHA) —which can insure 
loans with down payments as little as 3 pe rcent—has offered an alternative source of 
mortgage finance for some nonprime and near prime borrowers, the higher costs 
associated with FHA mortgages and the FHA’ s relatively strict lending standards and 
documentation requirements suggest that their lending is unlikely to have completely 
replaced the reduction in cr edit from other sources. 
House prices remain on a downward trajectory.  For existing homes, the monthly version 
of the purchase-only repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal Housing 
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased 5¼ percent over the 12 months ending in July.  
By comparison, the 20-city S&P/ Case-Shiller repeat-sales price index—which, unlike the 
OFHEO index, includes hous es financed by nonconfom ing loans but is less 
geographically representative—fell more than  16 percent over th e same period.  Although 
these lower prices are making homes more affordable, survey evidence and anecdotal reports suggest that expectations  of further house pr ice declines remain quite prevalent, a 
consideration that may make potential buyers reluctant to purchase homes until prices show signs of stabilizing. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have posted its third 
consecutive quarterly decline last  quarter.  Over the first ha lf of the year the declines 
were concentrated in business purchases of motor vehicles, construction machinery, and a 
few other categories.  Recently, however, the spending cutbacks appear to have become 
more widespread. 
The fundamentals underlying investment demand have deteriorated fr om earlier in the 
year.  Anecdotal evidence s uggests that an increasing num ber of businesses have had 
difficulty securing new credit, and the Nati onal Federation of Independent Businesses 
(NFIB) survey on loan availability indicates  that credit conditions for small businesses 
have tightened considerably.  In addition, the October SLOOS showed that the vast 
majority of banks had again tightened both price and nonprice terms for business loans.  
Moreover, forward-looking indicators of busines s activity have become noticeably darker

of late; the national ISM manu facturing index moved sharply lower in September, and the 
available regional indicators of busin ess conditions plummeted in October. 
Real spending on high-tech E&S appears to ha ve stalled last quarter.  Shipments of 
communications equipment fell considerably in July and August, and telecom service 
providers lowered their guidance for capital e xpenditures in the second half of the year.  
Real spending on computers and software app ears to have decelerated to an extremely 
sluggish pace last quarter, partly a result of weaker demand from the reeling finance 
industry, which accounts for a disproportionate share of spending on these items. 
Real outlays on transportation equipment seem  to have held about steady in the third 
quarter after steep declines earlier in the year.  Business purchases of light vehicles 
appear to have risen in the third quarter, as automakers signifi cantly boosted their 
deliveries to daily rental companies.  But sa les of medium and heavy trucks fell sharply 
in the third quarter after little change over th e first half of the year; orders for these 
vehicles collapsed last quarter, and industry an alysts attributed the decline to difficulties 
in obtaining financing, even for shippers with  reportedly good credit .  As for aircraft, 
Boeing deliveries, which were robust in July and August, plunged in September because 
of the machinists’ strike; with the strike c ontinuing, it is likely that Boeing will make no 
deliveries this month. 
Real purchases of equipment other than high-tech and transportation appear to have fallen 
last quarter.  Nominal orde rs and shipments of these cap ital goods posted broad-based 
declines in August, and the earlier reported increases for July were revised markedly 
lower; moreover, continued significant increas es in capital goods prices imply that real 
orders and shipments were even weak er than their nominal counterparts. 
Nonresidential construction 
Real nonresidential investment (other than  drilling and mining) appears to have 
decelerated sharply in the third quarter after ha ving risen at a robust ra te in the first half 
of the year.  Nominal expenditures turned down in July and fell further in August.  
Meanwhile, vacancy rates have been rising, and property values have been falling.  In 
addition, it has become increasingly difficult to acquire financing for new construction 
projects:  Interest rates have  increased, and lending standards for commercial real estate 
loans have continued to tighten over the past  three months accordi ng to the most recent 
SLOOS.  Consistent with these worsening fundamentals, the arch itectural billings 
index—a leading indicator of nonresidential investment—remained at a low level in September.

II-25 
Although the latest readings on footage dri lled and the number of drilling rigs in 
operation suggest that real expenditures on dril ling and mining structures increased 
further in the third quarter, the recent decl ine in oil and gas prices will likely damp 
activity in this sector. 
Business Inventories  
Firms drew down their inventories at a rapi d pace in the second quarter, and book-value 
data for the manufacturing and trade sector s through August suggest that businesses have 
continued to shed real stocks over the summer.  Despite these runoffs , the indicators we 
track suggest that inventories in some i ndustries remain above desired levels.  In 
particular, the Census Bureau  data indicate that the rati o of book-value inventories to 
sales in the manufacturing and trade sectors, excluding motor vehicles, moved up in 
August, especially in a number  of durable goods sectors.  In addition, information from 
the staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that months’ supply excluding motor 
vehicles and parts remained elevated in Septem ber, particularly in areas such as business 
equipment, consumer goods, construction supp lies, and materials.  Finally, purchasing 
managers reported that their customers’ inventories were too high in September. 
Federal Government Sector  
The federal unified budget position eroded noticeably in the third quarter.  Receipts, 
adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financia l transactions, fell 5 percent relative to the 
same period a year earlier, reflecting an anem ic increase in individual income and payroll 
taxes and a 25 percent drop in corporate tax pa yments.  Individual income tax collections 
were held down by surprisingly weak quart erly nonwithheld payments in September, 
possibly the result of a furt her slowing in personal inco me and lower capital gains 
realizations.  The drop in cor porate tax payments was likely due to weak profits and the 
effects of the bonus depreciation provision th at firms are allowed to claim for capital 
spending in 2008. 
Turning to the expenditure side of the ledger, adjusted outlays in the third quarter rose 8 
percent from a year earlier.  This increas e was spurred both by the costs of the EUC 
program that was introduced in July a nd by continued robust increases in defense 
spending.  Data on defense spending from th e Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS) are 
consistent with another large increase in re al defense purchases in the national accounts 
in the third quarter. For fiscal year 2008 as a whole, which ended in September, the federal unified deficit 
reached $455 billion (3¼ percent of GDP), up from $162 billion (or 1¼ percent of GDP)

in fiscal 2007.  The substantial deteriorati on in the deficit reflects numerous factors, 
including the fiscal stimulus  package, relatively strong gr owth in defense spending, and 
the effect of the weakening economy on receipts and outlays. 
The recently approved Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) included 
$700 billion to fund the Troubled Assets Relief  Program (TARP).  Besides the TARP, the 
EESA also included $110 billion in net reve nue reductions, largely arising from the 
temporary extension of tax provisions such as  relief from the alternative minimum tax 
and the research and experimentation tax credit .  Separately, the continuing resolution 
that passed in September provided funding for discretionary programs in defense, homeland security, and veterans affairs for all of fiscal 2009 and provided funding for all 
other discretionary programs through March 6, 2009; the bill also included funding to support $25 billion in loans to help U.S. auto makers update their f actories and $23 billion 
of emergency funding in response to recent natural disasters.

State and Local Government Sector  
Despite reports of mounting budget pressures,  the incoming data point to a moderate 
increase in real state and lo cal purchases in the third qua rter.  Employment rose 24,000 
per month, on average, over the three months ending in September, a pace similar to that recorded over the first half of the year.  In addition, nominal construction spending rose 
in August (the latest available data) to a leve l 2½ percent (not at an  annual rate) above its 
second-quarter average; this gain was s purred by a sharp incr ease in spending on 
highways and sets the stage for a solid rise in real construction outlays in the third 
quarter. 
Going forward, however, state and local spending will no doubt be squeezed by the 
substantial deterioration in the sector’s fis cal position that is now taking hold.  Revenue 
collections in the final months of fiscal 2008 (which ended on June 30 in all but a few 
states) were tepid at both the state and local levels.
7  So far in fiscal 2009, revenues in 
many states are running below previously projected levels, and revenue forecasts for the year as a whole are being revised down in re sponse to the weakness in recent collections 
and the darker economic outlook.  In New Yo rk, for example, where the financial  
                                                 
6 Following the September CPI release, the Soci al Security Administration announced that the 
automatic cost-of-living allowance (COLA) for Soci al Security would be 5.8 percent.  The COLA 
adjustment is based on the change in the CPI-W and will boost benefits in January 2009. 
7 According to the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue, state 
revenues during the year ending in June were just 3 percent above their year-earlier level, while local 
revenues rose just 4 percent.  Both increases were more than 2 percentage points smaller than those recorded during the preceding year.

services industry accounts for one-fifth of the state’s tax re venue, the Division of Budget 
has shaved more than $1 billion (3 percent)  from its July projection of fiscal 2009 state 
tax collections; it expects to ma ke a substantial downward adjustment to its projection for 
fiscal 2010 as well.  Sizable shortfalls have also been reported in many other states, 
including California, Georgia, Illinois,  Maryland, Massachus etts, and Virginia. 
The responses to the deterior ation in revenues generally include calls for freezes on 
hiring and pay, layoffs, and other actions to move operating budgets back toward 
balance; some stretching out of construction pr ojects is also beginning to be reported.  In 
some cases, states are drawing down rainy da y funds to help close the emerging fiscal 
gaps and satisfy their balanced-budget requirements.  
Prices  
Headline consumer price inflation eased over the past two months, held down by declines 
in consumer energy prices.  We estimate that  overall PCE prices increased 0.1 percent in 
September after remaining unchanged in August.8  Despite these low readings, overall 
prices rose briskly over th e past year:  The 12-month change through September was 4¼ 
percent, up from the 2½ percent rise r ecorded over the previous 12 months.   Core PCE 
prices rose 0.2 percent in  August and September after two months of 0.3 percent 
increases.  Although increases in core consumer prices remain somewhat elevated 
relative to their pace earlier this year and la st, many of the factors that have been putting 
upward pressure on core inflation have diminished recently:  Prices for oil and other commodities have fallen sharply, core non-oil import prices and inte rmediate materials 
prices have both turned down, and inflati on expectations have retreated somewhat. 
Consumer energy prices have fallen back recent ly as sizable declines in spot prices for 
crude oil and natural gas have begun to show  through to the retail  level.  Consumer 
energy prices fell 3¼ percent in August, and we estimate that they decreased another 2 
percent in September.  Survey data from th e first half of October suggest that retail 
gasoline prices fell much more sharply this month.  Despite these price declines, gasoline 
margins have soared, both because of the usua l lagged reaction of reta il prices to changes 
in crude prices and because refinery outages in the Gulf region caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike pushed inventories to extremel y tight levels.  With nearly all of the 
gasoline refineries idled by the hurricanes having now restarted pr oduction, inventories 
are quickly being rebuilt and marg ins have started to turn down.  In contrast to very tight

gasoline inventories, heating oil inventories are only slightly lower than average for this 
time of the year, and natural gas inventories remain ample. 
Consumer food prices have continued to rise  rapidly in recent months, boosted in part by 
the substantial run up in farm commodity prices through midyear.  After surging 1 
percent in July, PCE food pr ices are estimated to have  moved up 0.6 percent in both 
August and September, thereby lifting their th ree-month change to an annual rate of 
9 percent.  Over the 12 months ending in Se ptember, food prices increased 6 percent, 
after having risen 4¼ percent over the previous 12 months.  Pr ices for most agricultural 
commodities have fallen considerably since July, although these do not appear to have 
yet shown through to the retail level. 
Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in September, up ½ percentage point from the pr evious 12-month change.  The step-up in 
core PCE price inflation this year likely re flects an acceleration in import prices and the 
pass-through of the previous la rge increases in the costs of energy and materials.  Indeed, 
prices of nearly all categories of goods have accelerated, and prices in many energy-
intensive categories of services—such as hous ehold operations and s upplies, airfares, and 
other transportation services—have shown si gnificantly larger accelerations than core 
PCE prices as a whole.  More  recently, these cost pressures have begun to ease with the 
drop in energy and other commodity prices as  well as the deceleration in import prices. 
Prices at earlier stages of processing have begun to soften.  After having risen significantly in each of the first eight months  of this year, the producer price index for 
core intermediate materials fell 0.3 percent in September.  This drop likely reflects some 
pass-through of declining comm odity prices, which started falling in mid-July and have 
dropped further since the close of the September Greenbook.  Over the past six weeks, the Journal of Commerce  index of industrial material s plunged 24 percent, and the 
Commodity Research Bureau index of spot industrials tumbled 17 percent.  Both now 
stand between 20 percent and 25 pe rcent below year-earlier levels. 
Survey-based measures of inflation expect ations have reversed  some of the upward 
movement seen during the spring and early su mmer.  Median expected inflation over the 
next 5 to 10 years, as measured by the Reuters/Michigan Survey, dropped back to 
2.8 percent in the October preliminary release,  similar to its level from a year ago and 
within the narrow range in which it fluctuated  over the previous few years.  Near-term 
inflation expectations have also declined in recent months; however, the 4.5 percent 
reading for median expected inflation ove r the next 12 months from the October

preliminary Reuters/Michigan Survey release remains quite elevated relative to its level 
in the past few years.  As discussed in the “Domestic Financial Developments” section, 
TIPS (Treasury inflation-protecte d securities) have exhibited heightened volatility in the 
past few months.  As a result, the staff’s measure of in flation compensation based on 
these yields is probably not very informativ e at this time about movements in inflation 
expectations or in inflation risk premiums. 
Labor Costs 
Increases in labor costs have remained mode rate.  Based on data from the latest GDP 
release, we estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm busin ess sector increased 
3¾ percent in the second quarter and 4 percen t over the most recent four quarters—about 
the same pace as in the past several years.  We estimate th at productivity in the nonfarm 
business sector rose 3¼ percent, up from only ½ percent over the previous four quarters.  
Accordingly, the increase in unit labor cost s over the most recent four quarters—at 
¾ percent—is well below its average rate over the past several years.  More recently, 
average hourly earnings of  production and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm 
payrolls rose 0.2 percent in September, th ereby bringing the yea r-over-year change to 
3.4 percent—about ¾ percentage point lowe r than its increase over the previous 
12 months.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  
 
 Overview 
Financial markets experienced extraordin ary strains over the intermeeting period. 
Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the rapid deterioration of the position of 
American International Group, Inc. (AIG), the closing of Washington Mutual, and the 
mounting pressures that forced the sale of Wachovia, concerns  about financial institutions 
intensified and liquidity in many markets became severely impaired.  In short-term 
funding markets, spreads between term Libor  and overnight index swap (OIS) rates 
soared to record highs, money market mutual  funds faced large redemptions for a period, 
and demand for commercial paper dropped.  Investor demand shif ted heavily to the safety 
and liquidity of short-dated Treasury securi ties, which generally traded at very low 
yields.  Against a backdrop of pronounced vol atility, stock prices registered a steep 
decline, and credit spreads for corporate bonds jumped.   
On October 8, the FOMC, in coordination with  other central banks, lowered the target 
federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1½ pe rcent.  Based on futu res quotes, market 
participants now anticipate fu rther policy easing this year .  In addition, the Federal 
Reserve responded to the financial market turmoil—partly in conjunction with the 
Treasury, the Federal Deposit In surance Corporation (FDIC) , and other central banks—
by taking numerous other actions to address ma rket functioning and liquidity.  Late in the 
intermeeting period, conditions in short-term  funding markets improved somewhat.   
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses has held up  so far in October, reflecting continued 
sizable draws on existing lines of cred it at banks and moderate bond issuance by 
investment-grade firms.  In the househol d sector, mortgage de linquency rates have 
continued to rise, and the government-sponsor ed enterprises (GSEs) and the Federal 
Housing Administration have remained the main  source of residential mortgage funding.  
Over the intermeeting period, markets for shor t-term and long-term municipal securities 
came under pressure, and yields in secondary markets climbed.  In the October Senior 
Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lendi ng Practices, a large fraction of banks 
reported having continued to tighten their le nding standards and term s on all major types 
of loans to businesses and househol ds over the past three months.  
Financial Institutions Investor anxiety about the conditions of financ ial institutions intensified over the past six 
weeks, and the accompanying pressures led to a number of significant reorganizations.  
With confidence about its condition eroding, Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by 
Bank of America in the days immediately before the September FOMC meeting.  Around

1 The table “Selected Recent Actions by the Federal Reserve” lists a number of official actions taken 
since mi d-September.   the same time, Lehman Brothers filed for ba nkruptcy, and conditions at AIG deteriorated 
rapidly.  On September 16, the Federal Rese rve, with the sup port of the Treasury, 
announced its intention to extend a sizable loan  to AIG to assist the company in meeting 
its obligations, thereby facil itating a process under which AI G could sell some of its 
businesses in an orderly manner.  On Se ptember 26, the FDIC took Washington Mutual 
(WaMu) into receivership and facilitate d JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of WaMu’s 
banking operations that same evening.  Holders of WaMu’s senior and subordinated debt 
suffered significant losses, which seemed to heighten anxiety among depositors and other 
creditors of other banks.  As pressures on standalone investment banks mounted, 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applie d for and received bank holding company 
charters from the Federal Reserve.  Subs equently, Goldman Sachs received a sizable 
equity injection from Berkshire Hathaway, as  did Morgan Stanley from Mitsubishi UFJ.  
In addition, after initially reaching an ag reement with Citigroup, Wachovia eventually 
agreed to be acquired by Wells Fargo in  a transaction covering all of Wachovia’s 
preferred equity and debt a nd requiring no financial assi stance from the FDIC.   
The negative sentiment toward financial firm s weighed on the secto r’s equity prices, 
which dropped about 17 percen t over the intermeeting period.   In addition to worries 
about future earnings, some of the reducti ons in market value may have reflected 
shareholders’ concerns about the dilutive eff ects of possible equity injections by outside 
private investors or the federal government.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads for large 
banks and for regional banks, which had so ared in the wake of Lehman Brothers’ 
bankruptcy and AIG’s deteriora tion in mid-September, changed little on net over the next 
month, but fell after the October 14 announcemen t of the Treasury’s Capital Purchase 
Program and the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.  Under these programs, a broad range of depository institutions  are eligible to sell preferred shares to 
the U.S. government and to obtain guarantees  of non-interest-beari ng transaction deposits 
and some senior unsecured debt.   
Short-Term Funding Markets 
Over the intermeeting period, money markets came under extraordinary pressure, and the 
Federal Reserve and other central banks took a number of actions to provide liquidity and 
improve market functioning.
1  In September, the Lehman bankruptcy and the problems at 
AIG sparked anxiety about shor t-term debt exposures among i nvestors.  The combination 
of markdowns on sizable holdings of Lehman Brothers commercial paper and enormous

 net redemptions by institutional investors caus ed the net asset value of the Reserve Prime 
Money Market Fund to drop below $1 per sh are on September 16.  Other prime money 
market mutual funds (MMMFs), which invest mo stly in short-term instruments other than 
Treasury and agency securities, experience d massive net outflows that week, while 
government-only MMMFs saw substantial net in flows. This reallocation sharply reduced 
the demand for commercial paper (CP) and significantly raised the demand for Treasury 
bills and other short-dated government secu rities.  As a consequence, short-dated 
Treasury bills traded frequently at near-zero yields, despite billions  of dollars of new 
issuance under the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP), while risk spreads on CP 
surged and were extremely volatile.   
On September 19, the Treasury and the Fede ral Reserve announced two new programs 
aimed at alleviating the pressures on MMMF s and the CP market:  The Treasury 
announced it would offer insurance to registered MMMFs using the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund, and the Federal Reserve announced its Asset-Backed Commercial 
Paper (ABCP) Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility (AMLF). The facility 
extends nonrecourse loans at the primary credit rate to U.S. depository institutions and bank holding companies to finance their pur chases of highly rated ABCP from money 
market funds.  The announcements helped stem the net redemptions from MMMFs.  However, CP markets remained under pressu re—particularly those for unsecured paper 
issued by financial firms and for ABCP, as ri sk spreads on such paper stayed wide and 
amounts outstanding continued to trend down.  On October 7, the Federal Reserve 
approved the establishment of the Commerci al Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), which 
will provide financing to a special purpose vehicle that purchases highly rated three-month unsecured CP and ABCP directly from issuers at moderate spreads to three-month OIS rates.  Additional details about th e CPFF were provided on October 14, and the 
program is expected to begin operation on October 27.  On October 21, the Federal 
Reserve announced the creation of the M oney Market Investor Funding Facility 
(MMIFF), in which the Federal Reserve will provide financing for a private-sector initiative to create a set of special purpose vehicles that would purchase highly-rated commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and other eligible money market instruments 
from eligible MMMFs.  In the past severa l days, conditions in the CP market have 
improved somewhat, and yields on highly-rate d unsecured financial paper and on ABCP 
have decreased.   
Conditions in unsecured interbank funding markets deteriorated significantly further over 
much of the intermeeting period, with spreads of one-month and three-month Libor over 
III-6 
 
 comparable-maturity OIS soaring to record  highs.  Conditions in these term funding 
markets improved somewhat after the FDIC announced late in the intermeeting period 
that it would guarantee certain liabilities of U.S. banking or ganizations, although there is 
considerable uncertainty about how the FDIC  program will be implemented.  In recent 
days, one-month and three-month Libor-OIS spreads have been around 100 basis points 
below their peak levels in early October.   
Early this month, substantial pressures emerged even in the overnight funding markets, 
which had previously functioned reasonably we ll.  The spread between overnight Libor 
and the target federal funds rate climbed to more than 350 basis points in early October, 
and overnight federal funds traded within an unusually wide ra nge, reflecting tiering 
across institutions.  Conditions in overnigh t funding markets improved significantly after 
the Federal Reserve, in conjunction with ot her central banks, injected considerable 
amounts of liquidity, with overnight Libor dr opping about 400 basis points since October 
9.  Even after the Federal Reserve started paying interest to depository institutions on 
required and excess reserves on October 9, the federal funds rate moved down to very 
low levels by the end of the day.  Entities th at are not eligible to  earn interest on their 
account balances at the Federal Reserve—such  as the GSEs—reportedly have accounted 
for much of the lending at ra tes below that paid to depos itory institutions for excess 
reserves.  On October 22, the Board appr oved a narrowing of the spread between the 
target federal funds rate and the rate paid on excess reserve balances—a move that should 
help foster trading in the federal funds ma rket at rates closer to the target.   
The repo market also experienced substantia l dislocations over th e intermeeting period.  
Amid extremely high demand for Treasury securities and reluctance among investors holding Treasury securities to lend them out, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general 
collateral was quite volatile and traded at very low levels fo r most of the period.  Against 
this backdrop, failures to deliv er Treasury securities (which include failures in the cash 
and repo markets) reached record high levels in recent weeks, and the overnight lending of securities from the System Open Market Account (SOMA) soared.  To address strains 
in the Treasury repo market, the Federal Reserve introduced temporary changes in 
SOMA lending during the intermeeting period, including a reduction in the fee structure 
and an increase in the dealer limit from $4 billion to $5 billion.  In addition, the U.S. Treasury conducted special aucti ons of coupon securities that were in particularly short 
supply.  Repo rates on agency mortgage-backed s ecurity (MBS) collateral were also very 
volatile.  The repo market for nontraditional collateral—that other than Treasuries, 
agencies, and agency MBS—came under signific ant pressure, as investors anxious about 
III-7 
 
 
 exposures to riskier securities pulled back  and as heavy redemptions at MMMFs reduced 
their ability to provide liquid ity to funding markets.  On net in recent weeks, dealers 
raised haircuts on a number of types of repo collateral from already elevated levels.  
Federal Reserve Liquidity Provisions 
Amid the disruptions in financial markets, on September 17, the Treasury announced a 
temporary SFP at the request of the Federal Reserve.  Under this program, the Treasury has issued bills, over and above its regular borrowing program, with the proceeds deposited at the Federal Reserve for the purpos e of draining reserves to keep the federal 
funds rate close to the FOMC’s target.  The level of balances  held at the Federal Reserve 
under the SFP currently stands at about $560 billion.  After the SFP was initiated, the Federal Reserve announced significant expansio ns to its Term Auction Facility (TAF) 
and reciprocal currency swap lines with some foreign central banks.   
Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet grew and the 
composition of its assets shifted further aw ay from government securities.  Depository 
institutions—both domestic and foreign—made heavy use of the discount window, with 
primary credit outstanding rising about $75 billion in recent w eeks to almost $110 billion.  
Meanwhile, TAF credit outstanding increase d $113 billion to $263 billion.  Credit 
extended through the Primary Dealer Credit Faci lity also surged ahead of quarter-end; 
although it has moved down some in recent weeks, the current level of $109 billion outstanding is much higher than at any point  before mid-September.  The nine Term 
Security Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions  conducted over the intermeeting period—
three for schedule 1 collateral and six for sc hedule 2 collateral—saw very high demand 
and stopped out well above the corresponding minimum fee rates.   In addition, on September 24, dealers exercised about $47 billio n of the nearly $50 billion of options for 
TSLF loans spanning the September quarter-end.  In terms of new programs, the total amount of credit extended under the AMLF is  currently about $110 billion, while credit 
extended to AIG amounts to around $83 billion. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Since the September FOMC meeting, market  participants have marked down their 
expected path for the federal funds rate for the next two years.  Initially, the FOMC’s 
decision to leave its policy rate unchanged at  the September meeting led some market 
participants to scale back expectations fo r policy easing over the next year.  However, 
market expectations quickly reversed in res ponse to the heightened financial turmoil and 
to generally weaker-than-expect ed economic data. As part of a coordinated action with

 other central banks on October 8, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds 
rate by 50 basis points.  Inve stors evidently interpreted the accompanying statement as 
suggesting a likelihood of additional easing in coming months.  Options on federal funds 
futures currently suggest that investors place considerable odds on the federal funds rate 
being reduced at least 25 basis points at the October meeting.  Futures prices suggest that 
market participants expect the funds rate to  be about 1 percent by year-end.  Eurodollar 
futures quotes, combined with our usual assumptions regarding term premia, imply that 
investors expect the FOMC to begin raising the funds rate by the second quarter of 2009, 
with the rate expected to be roughly 2¾ per cent by the end of 2010.  However, translating 
futures quotes into policy expectations is more difficult than usual given the difficulties in adjusting for term premiums in the cu rrent, volatile environment and also the 
likelihood that market participants may expect the funds rate to continue to trade below 
the target for a while longer.  
The short end of the nominal Treasury yield cu rve declined notably owing to substantial 
flight-to-quality flows and high demand for liquidity.  However, higher term premiums in 
connection with heightened uncertainty along wi th expectations of a large increase in the 
supply of Treasury securities associated with the Emergenc y Economic Stabilization Act, 
which was enacted on October 3, and other initiatives, pushed longer-term Treasury 
yields higher.  All told, two-year nomina l Treasury yields decr eased 32 basis points, 
while five- and ten-year yiel ds increased about 5 and 60 ba sis points respectively.  TIPS-
based inflation compensation over the next five years dropped more than 100 basis 
points.  Although the decrease partly reflected  a drop in the prices  of oil and other 
commodities as well as the weaker economic  outlook, it was likely amplified by a sharp 
increase in the premium investors required to hold TIPS rath er than their more liquid 
nominal counterparts.  Implied inflation comp ensation five to ten ye ars ahead rose about 
60 basis points over the intermee ting period, but this increase s eems to have been driven 
more by the effects of an exp ected future increase in the supply of longer-term nominal 
Treasury yields than by an increase in either inflation expectations or perceived inflation 
uncertainty.  Measures of in flation compensation derived fr om inflation swap contracts 
posted modest declines across th e term structure and appeared  more consistent with the 
mixed changes in inflation expectations reporte d in the Michigan survey in mid-October. 
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad stock price indexes fell more than 20 pe rcent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
as concerns about financial turmoil intens ified significantly and economic data showed 
further signs of weakness.  Although equity prices jumped more than 11 percent on

 October 13 after reports that the Treasury would soon announce a plan to inject capital 
into banks, they subsequently retraced a good pa rt of those gains.  Over the intermeeting 
period, the spread between the twelve-month fo rward trend-earnings-price ratio for S&P 
500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yi eld—a rough measure of the equity risk 
premium—soared to an extraordinarily high level, and option-implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 surged well beyond previous record highs. 
Yields and spreads on investment-grade a nd speculative-grade corporate bonds also 
ballooned, as perceived default risk and risk premiums evid ently jumped.  An index of 
CDS spreads for investment-grade financial firms climbed to about  twice its previous 
high, and an index for nonfinancial firms se t a record as well, although its level has 
remained far below that for financial firms. Judging from the wide range and the 
declining frequency of dealer quotes, liquidity and price di scovery in the CDS market 
continued to be strained, particularly for financial firms.  Markets for corporate bonds 
were also less liquid than usual, as estimated  bid-asked spreads in the secondary market 
for corporate bonds rose sharply—particularl y for speculative-grade bonds.  Conditions 
also deteriorated sharply in the secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans.  The 
average bid price plunged an unprecedented 15 cents to nearly 71 cents on the dollar, 
which reportedly reflected continued deleve raging by institutional investors and the 
unwinding of total return swaps.  The aver age bid-asked spread for leveraged loans 
surged. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
About 150 firms in the S&P 500 index have repo rted for the third qua rter.  Using actual 
earnings for those firms and Wall Street analysts’ estimates for the rest, earnings per 
share for the S&P 500 appear on track to come in about 9 percent below the year-earlier 
level.  Financial sector profits are again expected to post a substantial four-quarter 
decline.  In contrast, analysts  expect nonfinancial profits to  be about 12 percent above the 
year-earlier level, although the oil and gas industry accounts for virtually all of the 
anticipated gains.  In addition, an index of revisions to analys ts’ expectations of earnings 
for S&P 500 firms over the coming year is esti mated to have hit its most negative level 
on record in mid-October, a result of substa ntial markdowns of prof it forecasts for both 
financial and nonfinancial firms. 
For the roughly half of publicly traded ba nk and thrift holding companies that have 
reported to date, third-quarter earnings were  weaker than had been expected; almost  
III-14 
 
 
 90 percent of banks and thrifts reported earnings that fell short of analysts’ expectations.  
Excluding the three financial inst itutions that will be acquire d in the near term (Merrill 
Lynch, Sovereign, and Wachovia), third-quarter  earnings were only about 15 percent of 
the level reported a year earlier.  Among th e factors reportedly contributing to weak 
earnings last quarter were wr ite-downs on portfolios of secu rity holdings and continued 
sizable loan-loss provisions to offset increased credit losses on residential real estate 
loans, construction and land development loans,  auto loans, and credit card loans.   
Although the credit qua lity of nonfinancial corporations has remained solid overall, there 
has been some deterioration in recent months.  In the second quarter, the aggregate ratio of liquid assets to total assets continued to trend down gradually, while the aggregate 
leverage ratio was little changed at a low le vel by historical standards.  In the third 
quarter, Moody’s downgraded a moderate vol ume of nonfinancial bonds, while the 
volume upgraded was very small.  In additi on, the share of corporate bonds outstanding 
rated “deep junk”—that is, bonds rated B3 or below on Moody’s scale—increased to 
about 6½ percent last quarte r.  The realized default rate on all corporate bonds 
skyrocketed in September, but two financia l companies, Washington Mutual and Lehman 
Brothers, accounted for most of the jump. 
Business Finance 
Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial firms has been moderate in 
October, while no speculative-grade bonds have been issued.  Nonfinancial commercial 
paper outstanding has risen a bit this mont h, after having contracted noticeably in 
September.  Commercial and industrial lendi ng stayed strong in early October, as firms 
reportedly continued to draw heavily on existi ng bank lines of credit.  Overall, based on 
data for the first half of the month, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses in 
October is on track to be close to the third-quarter pace.   
Outside of a very large offering by General Electric, the volume of seasoned equity 
offerings by nonfinancial corporations has been weak this month, and there have been no 
initial public offerings.  In the second quarter, equity retirements from cash-financed mergers and share repurchases slowed somewhat .  As a result, net equity retirements by 
nonfinancial firms in the second quarter slow ed further.  In the third quarter, cash-
financed mergers continued at roughly the pace of the previous quarter, while 
announcements of share repurchase programs moderated again.  A few large financial 
institutions issued equity in September a nd October, although the total amount was below 
the pace in the first half of the year. 
III-15 
 
 
 Commercial Real Estate 
The growth of commercial mortgage debt is likely to have slowed further in the third 
quarter after having moderated quite a bit duri ng the first half of the year.  Preliminary 
data suggest that the value of commercial real estate transactions declined in September 
to its lowest level in five years, whic h likely reflected tight  financing and falling 
commercial property prices.  Conditions in secondary markets for commercial mortgages 
continued to be strained.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) 
was shut off completely in the third quarter.  Spreads on CDS of indexes of CMBS stayed 
high over the intermeeting period.  In Septem ber, the delinquency rate for commercial 
mortgages held in CMBS pools was little ch anged at a fairly low level, but the 
delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held by banks appears likely to have 
increased further in the thir d quarter on continued deterior ation in the performance of 
construction loans.   
Household Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming 
mortgages was volatile and increased, on net, about 50 basis points, to almost 6.5 percent 
as of October 16 (the latest observation).  As of that reading, the spread between the 
conforming mortgage rate and the on-the-run te n-year Treasury yield had nearly returned 
to the very elevated level posted just before  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into 
conservatorship in early September.  In re cent days, however, posted interest rates on  
30-year fixed-rate mortgages have moved dow n noticeably, largely reflecting a decline in 
nominal Treasury yields.  Meanwhile, th e interest rate on nonconforming jumbo 
mortgages has remained extremely high in recent weeks.   
The national house price indexes released by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise 
Oversight and by S&P/Case-Shiller showed further pronounced declines in July.  The 
very soft housing market has also continued to weigh on mortgage credit quality.  Delinquency rates for prime, alt A, and subpr ime mortgages all rose again in August. 
Currently both prime and subprime delinquency ra tes stand at levels that are about double 
those seen a year earlier, while the alt-A deli nquency rate is almost four times the level a 
year earlier.   
In secondary mortgage markets, issuance of  MBS by the housing GSEs increased slightly 
in September but remained somewhat below the pace seen in the first half of the year.  
Issuance by Ginnie Mae continued to be very strong last month, but the non-agency MBS 
market remained closed.

 Delinquency rates for securitized  revolving credit card debt ticked up in August, while 
delinquencies on auto loans at the domestic captive finance companies changed little. 
Both series have moved up considerably ove r the past few years but remain below the 
peak levels reached in the late 1990s.  Broadl y consistent with reports from some finance 
companies, results from the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Su rvey revealed that 
many lenders have further tightened terms and standards for consumer loans.  Sizable net 
fractions of Domestic banks reported lo wering credit limits on existing credit card 
accounts to both prime and nonprime borrowers, ci ting a less favorable or more uncertain 
economic outlook, reduced tolerance for risk, an d declines in customer credit scores as 
important reasons for the decreases.  Although most students appear to have successfully 
obtained government-guaranteed student loans fo r the fall semester, lenders continue to 
tighten underwriting standard s on non-government-guaranteed loans, and some major 
providers of these loans have exited the ma rket.  Restrictive supply conditions and weak 
demand have weighed on consumer credit, which, over the three months ending in August, increased at the slowest pace in more than fifteen years.  In secondary markets, 
spreads on asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by consumer credit were at historically high levels and issuance in the third quarter was considerably below the 
robust pace earlier this year. 
With asset prices falling steeply, investors,  on net, withdrew s ubstantial amounts from 
long-term mutual funds in September and ear ly October.  September’s net outflows, 
which were the largest on record in nominal terms, were concentrated in equity mutual 
funds, but this month’s redemptions have been  more widespread among asset classes.   
Treasury Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury c onducted several auctions for nominal and 
inflation-indexed coupon securities.  In a ddition, issuance of Treasury bills amounted to 
about $1.2 trillion, including $645 billion of cas h management bills under the temporary 
Supplementary Financing Program.  Demand for the Treasury bills was extremely 
strong—despite the large volum e of issuance, yields in secondary markets were 
frequently near 0 percent.  In addition, to a ddress the high level of fails to deliver in the 
Treasury market, the Treasury re-opened several i ssues in the 7- to 9- year sector that had 
experienced acute shortages in secondary markets.  Demand for the regularly scheduled 
coupon auctions was generally in line with, or  somewhat greater than, demand in prior 
auctions.  Foreign participation at Treasury auctions increased a li ttle last month, while 
another indication of demand from foreign official instit utions—foreign custody holdings 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—rose notably.

 Extremely high demand for Treasury bills and near-dated coupon securities contributed 
to strained conditions in the Treasury ma rket.  Bid-asked spre ads on on-the-run coupon 
securities surged and are now near their prev ious high levels in mid-March.  Meanwhile, 
yield-curve fitting errors increased as investor s apparently remained reluctant to arbitrage 
price differences across similar securities.  The market’s preference for relatively liquid 
securities pushed to new hi ghs the spread between yields  on the on-the-run and off-the-
run ten-year notes.  In Octobe r, daily average volume in secondary Treasury markets fell 
to about 20 percent below year-earlier levels. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Conditions in the municipal bond market dete riorated substantially over most of the 
intermeeting period.  Issuance of long-term municipal bonds for both advance refundings 
and new capital projects slowed markedly in September and early October.  A number of 
planned issues were scaled down or pulled a ltogether, as tax-exempt yields rose to a 
record high level relative to Treasuries.  Last  week, however, the market showed signs of 
stabilization—California and New York City were able to issue about $5½ billion of 
short-term debt, although both issues carried very high interest rates.  
The credit quality of municipal bonds deterior ated in the third quarter, as the number of 
rating downgrades far outpaced the number of upgrades.  In additi on, last month, markets 
for municipal securities came unde r substantial pressure as co ncerns about liquidity led 
investors to pull back from st ructured short-term securities that were backed by long-term 
bonds.  The resulting flood of the underlying long-term securities into the secondary 
market caused yields to jump to their highest levels in recent years and ratios of yields to 
Treasuries to soar well beyond pr evious record levels.    
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 surged at an annual rate of 15½ percent in September and is on track to accelerate to 
a 17 percent pace this month.  Liquid deposits su rged in September, in part because of a 
large expansion of accounts held by broker-deal ers, trusts, and corporate customers at a 
few large banks.  Small time deposits increase d sharply in September and skyrocketed in 
early October, as banks and thrifts reportedly continued to  bid aggressively for these 
deposits; in addition, the acceleration in Octobe r may reflect a shift in some funds away 
from liquid deposits, which, on the basis of av ailable data, are expected to essentially 
hold steady this month.  Growth of currency picked up notably, on balance, over 
September and October, with the available indicators suggesting stronger foreign and

 domestic demand.  And, after having been about flat in September, retail money funds 
have seen very large net inflows so far this month.   
The financial turmoil had a noticeable effect on bank credit, which surged in September.  
The volatile “other loans” category saw a ma rked increase in unplanned overdrafts by a 
wide range of customers, including money fund complexes, and in draws on lines of 
credit by financial companies, consistent with strains in funding markets.  Last month, 
banks acquired a large volume of non-agenc y, nongovernment securities, with purchases 
of commercial paper under the AMLF progr am reportedly accounting for some of the 
activity.  Bank credit was also  boosted by a surge in commercial and industrial loans, 
much of which can be attributed to drawdow ns on existing bank lines by a broad range of 
nonfinancial business borrowers.  In contrast, commercial real estate loans held by banks 
were flat over the period.  On the househol d side, residential mortgage loans held by 
banks remained on a downtrend in recent week s, while home equity and consumer loans 
continued to grow robustly. 
The October 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opin ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices found 
that a large fraction of domestic institutions continued to tighten their lending standards 
and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months.  Half of domestic 
banks reported being less willing to make cons umer installment loans, a net percentage 
that approaches historical highs.  Demand for loans from both businesses and households 
at domestic institutions continued to weak en, on net, over the past three months.

1 Banks received the survey on or after October 2,  and their responses were due on October 16. Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
The October 2008 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.
1 The survey included two sets of special questions: The first set asked domestic and 
foreign banks about changes in the dollar am ount of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans 
according to whether they were drawn under preexisting commitments or not; the second set 
asked domestic banks about changes in credit limits on existing credit card accounts for prime 
and nonprime borrowers.  This  appendix is based on responses from 54 domestic banks and 
21 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
In the current survey, large net fractions of dom estic institutions reporte d having continued to 
tighten their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three 
months.  The net percentages of respondents that reported tightening standards increased relative 
to the July survey for both C&I and commercial real estate loans, as did the fractions reporting 
tightening for all price and nonprice terms on C&I loans.  Considerable fractions of foreign 
institutions also tightened credit standards a nd terms on loans to businesses over the past three 
months.  Demand for loans from both businesses and households at domestic institutions 
continued to weaken, on net, over the past three months.  Modest fractions of both large and smaller institutions reported, on net, increases in the dollar amount of C&I loans not drawn under preexisting commitments over the past three mont hs; both small and large banks also reported 
increases in the amounts of C&I loans drawn unde r commitment over the same period, though the 
net percentage reporting an increase was significantly higher for large institutions.  Large fractions of domestic banks also reported ti ghtening standards on loans to households and 
decreased demand for such loans.  Domestic banks reported reducing credit limits on existing 
credit card accounts to both prime and nonprime borrowers, citing a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, reduced tolerance for risk, and declines in customer credit scores as 
important reasons for the decreases.

 Business Lending 
Questions on C&I lending.   About 85 percent of domestic  banks—up substantially from  
60 percent in the July survey—reported having tig htened lending standards on C&I loans to large 
and middle-market firms over the past three months.  About 75 percent of such respondents—up 
slightly from the fraction in the July survey—also indicated that they had tightened their lending 
standards on C&I loans to small firms over the sa me period.  Significant majorities of domestic 
respondents indicated that they had tightened pri ce terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  On 
net, about 95 percent of such respondents reporte d having tightened the costs of credit lines to 
large and medium-sized firms, while nearly 90 pe rcent reported such tightening for smaller firms.  
Nearly all banks—up from roughly 80 percent in th e July survey—noted that they had increased 
spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, 
while about 95 percent of respondents—a higher fraction than the 70 percent in the July survey—reported having widened spreads on loans to small fi rms.  In addition, the fraction of domestic 
respondents that reported having tightened non-pri ce-related lending terms on C&I loans to firms 
of all sizes over the survey period increased signi ficantly relative to the July survey:  Higher 
fractions of large banks reported having reduced both the size and the maximum maturity of loans 
or credit lines to large and middle-market firms.  Additionally, roughly 75 percent of large bank respondents reported having tightened loan covenants on loans to large and middle-market firms, and about 70 percent reported having tighte ned covenants on loans to small firms. 
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also had tightened their business lending stance.  About 70 percent of the branches and agencies—up substantially from about 35 percent in the July survey—indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on C&I loans over the past 
three months.  Large fractions of foreign respondents reported that they had tightened loan terms, including premiums charged on riskier loans, cost  of credit lines, and the maximum size of credit 
lines.   
Almost all domestic and foreign respondents poi nted to a less favorable or more uncertain 
economic outlook as a reason for tightening their lending standards and terms on C&I loans over 
the past three months.  Large majorities of r espondents indicated that their bank’s reduced 
tolerance for risk and a worsening of industry-sp ecific problems were factors in their decision.  
Roughly 75 percent of foreign respondents and a bout 40 percent of domestic respondents noted 
that a deterioration in their bank’s current or expected capital position had contributed to the more stringent lending policies over the past three months , higher fractions than cited that factor in the 
July survey.   
The October survey of domestic banks points to a slight further weakening of C&I loan demand 
over the past three months.  On balance, 15 percent of domestic respondents reported a 
weakening of demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms, with about 5 percent

 reporting a weakening in demand from smaller firms.  On net, 5 percent of the U.S. branches and 
agencies of foreign banks responding to the survey  reported an increase in demand for C&I loans. 
Substantial majorities of the domestic institutions that experienced weaker loan demand over the 
past three months pointed to decreases in customers’ needs to finance investment in plant and equipment, to finance inventories, and to finan ce customer accounts receivable as reasons for the 
weaker demand.  In addition, all foreign and a la rge fraction of domestic respondents pointed to a 
decrease in customers’ needs for merger and acquisition financing as a reason for the lower 
demand for C&I loans. Among banks that reported an increase in demand, nearly all domestic 
respondents reported that customer borrowing ha d shifted to their bank from other bank or 
nonbank sources because these other sources had become less attractive.  In addition, both domestic and foreign respondents indicated that  customers’ internally generated funds had 
decreased.  About 5 percent of domestic instituti ons, on net, reported that inquiries from potential 
business borrowers had increased during the survey  period; in contrast, about 25 percent of 
foreign respondents, on net, reported a decrease. 
Special questions on changes in the dollar amount of outstanding C&I loans.  About  
35 percent, on net, of domestic respondents reported an increase in the dollar amount of C&I 
loans drawn under preexisting commitments.  Resp onses, however, differed substantially by bank 
size, with nearly 60 percent of large banks repor ting such an increase, on net, compared with 
5 percent of smaller banks.  With respect to C&I loans that were not drawn under previous 
commitment, roughly 25 percent of large banks reported an increase in the dollar volume of 
outstanding loans, only slightly lower than the corresponding net percentage of smaller banks, 
35 percent.   In the foreign survey, about 65 percent of respondents indicated that the dollar amount of outstanding C&I loans that were drawn under commitment had increased on net.  Forty percent of respondents to the foreign survey reported such an increase in C&I loans not drawn under preexisting commitments. 
Questions on commercial real estate lending.   On balance, about 85 percent of domestic 
banks—slightly higher than the 80 percent repor ted in the July survey —had tightened their 
lending standards on commercial real estate loan s (CRE) over the past three months.  About  
65 percent of foreign banks—up from about 35 percent in the July survey—also indicated that 
they had tightened their lending standards on CRE loans.  On net, about 55 percent of domestic banks and 40 percent of foreign banks reported weaker demand for such loans. 
Lending to Households 
Questions on residential real estate lending.   Large majorities of domestic respondents reported 
having tightened their lending standards on pr ime, nontraditional, and subprime residential 
mortgages over the previous three months.  A bout 70 percent of domestic respondents—down

2 A total of 51 institutions reported that they had originated prime residential mortgages.  According to 
the Call Reports, these 51 banks accounted for about 77 percent of residential real estate loans on the books 
of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2008. 
3 According to the Call Reports, these 28 institutions accounted for about 61 percent of residential real 
estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2008. 
4 According to the Call Reports, these 4 institutions accounted for about 11 percent of residential real 
estate loans on the books of all commercial banks as of June 30, 2008. from about 75 percent in the previous survey—indicated that they had tightened their lending 
standards on prime mortgages.2  Responses differed importantly by bank size, with about 
80 percent of the largest banks, but only 55 pe rcent of the smaller banks, reporting tighter 
standards for prime borrowers.  One smaller ba nk reported having eased standards somewhat. 
About 90 percent—up slightly from July—of th e 28 banks that originated nontraditional 
residential mortgage loans reported having tighten ed considerably their lending standards on such 
loans.3  All 4 of the banks that responded to the survey’s question about lending standards on 
subprime loans indicated that they had tightened  their lending standards on such loans over the 
past three months.4  Three banks that had reported providing subprime mortgages in the July 
survey no longer were doing so in October. 
About 55 percent of domestic respondents—a so mewhat higher fraction than the roughly  
30 percent reported in the July survey—experienced weaker demand, on net, for prime residential 
mortgage loans over the past three months.  A higher net fraction of large banks than smaller 
banks reported a decline in demand.  About 70  percent—up from roughly 45 percent in the July 
survey—indicated weaker demand for nontraditio nal mortgage loans over the same period.  All 
4 of the domestic banks that originated subpr ime mortgage loans reported weaker demand for 
such loans over the survey period, compar ed with 4 of the 7 in the July survey. 
On net, about 75 percent of domestic respondents—down slightly from about 80 percent in the July survey—noted that they had tightened their lending standards for approving applications for revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) over the past three months.  About 20 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker demand for HELOCs over the past three months, double 
the fraction that had reported weaker demand in the July survey.  
Questions on consumer lending.  Down slightly from the July survey, large fractions of 
domestic banks reported tightenin g standards on consumer loans.  Nearly 60 percent of 
respondents indicated that they had tightened le nding standards on credit card loans, while nearly 
65 percent of respondents indicated that they had tightened lending standards on other consumer 
loans over the past three months.  Large banks reported a stronger tightening than other banks on 
both categories of consumer loans.  About 50 percent of banks reported having raised minimum required credit scores on credit card loans over the past three months, and 60 percent reported having raised minimum scores on other consumer  loans over the same period,  responses that 
were little changed from the July survey.  About 55 percent of respondent s also reported having 
III-A-9 
 
 reduced the extent to which credit card loans were  granted to customers who did not meet their 
bank’s credit-scoring thresholds, while about 60 percent of respondents reported a reduction in 
granting other kinds of consumer loans for that reason.  Also, significant net fractions of 
respondents reportedly raised minimum required down payments, as well as spreads of loan rates, 
on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  Half of domestic banks indicated that they had 
become less willing to make consumer installmen t loans over the past three months, a response 
approaching historical record levels and more ex treme than the 35 percent in the July survey.  
About 45 percent of respondents, on net, indicated that they had experienced weaker demand for consumer loans of all types over the past three months, up from 30 percent in the July survey. 
Special questions on existing credit card limits.  Two special questions asked domestic banks 
to indicate whether they had raised or lowered credit limits on existing card accounts and, if they 
had lowered limits, to give possible reasons for the change.  About 25 percent of domestic banks 
reported having lowered credit limits on existing credit card accounts to prime borrowers on net; 
about 30 percent of larger banks and 10 per cent of smaller banks had lowered such limits.  
Roughly 60 percent of banks had lowered limits  on existing accounts of nonprime borrowers; no 
banks reported raising limits to those borrowers.  About 95 percent of banks that had lowered 
limits cited a less favorable or more uncertain ec onomic outlook and reduced  tolerance for risk as 
reasons for lowering limits.   Large majorities of  respondents also cited a decline in customer 
credit scores and missed payment(s) by customers on credit card loan(s) and other loan(s) at their 
bank.

Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to  $59.1 billion in August,  as a large decline 
in the value of petroleum imports more than o ffset a fall in exports of goods and services.   
 
 
 In August, the value of exports of goods and se rvices declined 2 percent, led by a fall in 
exports of automotive products that followed a surge in July.  Exports of consumer 
goods, industrial supplies, and services also moved down 
after strong increases in 
previous months.  Exports of capital goods moved up strongly, but this primarily 
reflected  record exports of aircraft , while other categories were weak.   
Notwithstanding the August decr ease, the average value of exports in July and August 
rose 22.2 percent at an annual rate from the s econd quarter, the same pace recorded in the 
second quarter.  The increase was supported by strong exports of pe troleum products and 
other industrial supplies, alt hough all other major categories of exports also exhibited 
large gains.            
IV-2

 The value of imports of goods and services fe ll 2.4 percent in August,  as a large decline 
in oil imports (both on account of lower volum es as well as a decrease in prices) more 
than offset increases in non-oil goods and se rvices.  The gain in non-oil goods reflected a 
jump in imports of consumer goods, partic ularly pharmaceutical products, as well as 
strong imports of industrial supplies.  In contrast, imports of capital goods and 
automotive products fell.  Imports of services surged on  account of royalty payments 
associated with the 2008 Summer Olympics.       
The average value of imports in July and A ugust increased 15.8 percent at an annual rate 
relative to the second qu arter.  The increase largely refl ected increased imports of oil, 
which stemmed from both higher prices a nd higher volumes.  Industrial supplies, 
consumer goods, and services also  recorded sizable gains.  In  contrast, imports of capital 
goods, particularly aircraft, and automobiles fell off sharply.   
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In September, prices of core im ports fell 0.5 percen t, the larg est one-
month decline in over 8 years.  The decline reflected falling prices for material-intensive 
goods, automotive products, and consumer goo ds.  The 0.1 percent price declines for 
automotive products and consumer goods were the first declines recorded for these 
categories since early 2006.  However, most of the decline in the core import price index 
was due to lower prices for material-intensive goods, which fell 1.5 percent in September, 
driven by lower prices for me tals and some types of food.  The only major category of 
core goods with higher prices was ca pital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors), for which prices rose 0.2 percent in September.   
In the third quarter, core import prices rose  6¼ percent at an annual rate, a sharp step 
down from the 13¼ percent increase observed in  the second quarter.  After increasing 
31½  percent in the second quarter, prices for material-intensive goods rose 14¼ percent.  
Prices for finished goods increased 2¼ percent,  less than half the pace recorded in the 
second quarter.  Prices decelerated for both consumer goods and capital goods (excluding 
computers and semiconductors). 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price i ndex of imported oil declined for the second 
consecutive month, falling 9 percent in Septembe r.  The drop marked the largest monthly 
decline in two years.  Similarly, the spot pr ice of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude 
oil continued to decline in September, falling 11 percent to an average of $104 per barrel 
for the month as a whole.  Smoothing through highly volatile price movements in recent  
IV-5 
 
IV-6 
 
 
 weeks, spot WTI has continued to fall th rough mid-October, closing most recently on 
October 21 at $70.89 per barrel.  The steep fall in  oil prices appears to  reflect the rapidly 
deteriorating prospects for growth in  global oil demand stemming from recent 
macroeconomic and financial market developments.  Oil prices have moved lower 
despite significant supply disruptions st emming from hurricane damage to oil 
infrastructure in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as outages of a major pipeline that 
transports oil from Azerbaijan.   
Exports.   Following a 2 percent decline in August, prices of exported core goods fell 
1 percent in September.  Prices of agricult ural goods fell only 0.3 percent in September, 
after a 9.6 percent decline in August.  Prices  of nonagricultural industrial supplies fell 
2.7 percent in September, reflecting lower prices for metals and fuel oil.  Overall, prices 
for finished goods were flat in September.  A 0.3 percent decline in the prices of exported 
consumer goods offset small price increases  for capital goods (excluding computers and 
semiconductors) and automotive products.   
After increasing 12½ percent in the second quarter , core export prices rose 4¾ percent in 
the third quarter.  The slow down was concentrated within  material-intensive goods, 
which increased only 7 percent in the third quarter, following a 23¼ percent increase in 
the second quarter.  Prices of agricultural  products and nonagricultural industrial supplies 
rose 4¾ and 8 percent respectively.  Pri ces of exported finished goods were up 
2½ percent.

 U.S. Current Account 
The U.S. current account deficit was $733 bill ion (annual rate) in the second quarter of 
2008, $30 billion wider than in the first quarter (revised).  The widening resulted 
primarily from payments associated with incr eased earnings on foreign direct investment 
in the United States.  In a ddition, increased imports of petr oleum more than offset higher 
goods exports and widened the deficit on goods and services.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the September Greenbook, we have received U.S. balance of payments data for the 
second quarter of 2008, data on U.S. internati onal financial transact ions for August, and 
partial and confidential data  on custody accounts at the Fe deral Reserve Bank of New 
York (FRBNY) through mid-October.    
 
 Starting with the most recent data, foreign offi cial inflows (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. 
International Financial Transactions table and the chart on Foreign Official Financial 
Flows) slowed noticeably in August, despit e strong inflows from OP EC countries as oil 
prices surged.   
 
.  Partial and confidential 
data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that official 
inflows moved higher in Septem ber.  Over half of these 
inflows represented net purchases of Treasury securities; remarkably, the remaining inflows were not used to 
purchase other securities; rath er, they took the form of 
increased deposits in the “R P Pool”--a special cash 
account at FRBNY.  Although deposits in this account earn very little income--the yield is close to  the overnight 
rate on general collateral repurchase agreements--this low yield is likely outweighed by a desire to maintain liquid deposits at FRBNY.  Partial data for October show strong inflows into Treasury securities by foreign o fficials that were offset by net sales of 
agency securities by foreign officials (see inse t chart).   
.    
In September, the reciprocal swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were extended to other cen tral banks, and the sizes of existing swap 
facilities were increased.  Drawings on these f acilities (included in line 2) represent an 
additional $224 billion in net outflows in September and $200 billion in early October. 
Recent data on securities transa ctions show that foreign priv ate investors continued to sell 
U.S. securities (line 4; see al so the chart on Privat e Securities Flows) in  August.  Foreign 
private investors on net purchased Treasury secu rities (line 4a); however, these purchases 
were more than offset by net sales of agency and corporate debt (lines 4b and 4c), 

IV-10 
   
   
 
 resulting in an outflow.  Similarly, U.S. priv ate investors on net sold  foreign securities 
(line 5), which resulted in an inflow.       
Net banking outflows (line 3) eas ed a bit in August, following  very large net outflows in 
July and the two previous quarters.   Turning to the latest balance of payments rel ease, flows of U.S. direct investment abroad 
(line 6) eased a bit in the second quarter, as equity capital and intercompany debt 
outflows decreased.  Foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) picked up, 
primarily reflecting an increase in reinvested  earnings.  Custody data, which are only 
available quarterly (and include d in line 10), show a sizable  inflow as U.S. residents 
decreased their deposits in the Caribbean.  This partially offset the huge outflow recorded 
through interbank transactions (shown in line 3).  The statistical discrepancy in the 
second quarter swung to a sizable positive $47 billion, indicating some combination of 
over reporting of the current account deficit or  under reporting of ne t financial inflows.

 Foreign Financial Markets 
The banking and credit crisis has shaken financial markets across the globe since the time 
of the September Greenbook.  Strains have inte nsified in U.S. and European markets, 
while markets in the emerging market economies,  which until recently had not been hit as 
hard by the financial storm, have registered  sharp downward moveme nts in asset prices 
and extreme volatility.   
Following the collapses of Lehman Brothers an d the bailout of AIG, the spreads between 
term Libor and overnight index swap rates in  dollar, euro, and sterling rose from their 
already-elevated levels, w ith the increase most pronounced  in dollars.  The further 
constriction in interbank lending was soon fo llowed by several high-profile bank failures 
in Europe.  In late September, Bradford a nd Bingley, Fortis, and De xia were partially or 
fully nationalized, and Hypo Real Estate received a large capital injection from the 
German government, as their access to wholes ale funding rapidly dete riorated.  In early 
October, a widespread pullback from risk a ffected financial markets in virtually all 
advanced and emerging market economies, with rapid declines in stock prices, sharp 
movements in exchange rates, large increases in risk spreads, and an almost complete 
seizure of credit markets.   
The deepening of the crisis led many governme nt authorities to announce in the second 
week of October a series of measures of unprecedented scale and scope designed to 
support the banking system and to restore the f unctioning of credit markets.  In the days 
since these announcements, conditions in cr edit markets have improved somewhat, as 
evidenced by declining Libor-OIS spreads, and equity prices have risen slightly on net in 
most markets.  However, stock prices have  remained extremely volatile amid mounting 
concerns about the possible impact of the financial crisis on real economic activity 
around the globe.  On balance, since the time of the September Greenbook, equity indexes worldwide have registered very larg e declines, with headline indexes in Europe 
and Japan down 20 to 30 percent on net, about as much as in the United States.  Banking 
sector shares fell about 30 percent in Eu rope, and about 20 percent in Japan.   
Beginning in mid-September, to address the growing strain in th e global dollar funding 
market, the Federal Reserve repeatedly e xpanded its dollar swap lines with foreign 
central banks.  The Federal Reserve increased the size of the swap lines and the number of central bank counterparties (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and 
the United Kingdom were added).  Late in the period, as part of these swap arrangements, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of  England, the Swiss National Bank (SNB), 
IV-15 
 
 
 and the Bank of Japan began to conduct auc tions of dollar liquidity with 7-day, 28-day, 
and 84-day maturities at pre-announced fixed interest rates.  Dollar funding was made 
available in these auctions to fully m eet the quantity demanded by borrowers in 
possession of eligible collateral.  The SN B also used funds obtained in its swap 
arrangement with the Federal Reserve to pur chase a large amount of  dollar-denominated 
assets from UBS.   
On October 8, in a coordinated announcement, the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of 
England, the Bank of Canada, the SNB, and the Riksbank cut their respective policy rates 
by 50 basis points.  At the same time, the ECB announced that it would narrow the bands 
of its deposit and lending fac ilities to 50 basis points below and above its target.  Central 
banks in a number of other countries, includ ing Australia, China, Hong Kong, and India, 
among others, also cut policy rates over the period.  As the intermeeting period ended, 
markets were fully pricing further policy rate  cuts within the next few months by major 
foreign central banks.  To facilitate liquidity injections, a number of central banks modified their procedures for open market operations, often accep ting a wider array of 
collateral.  The ECB said that it would change  its weekly main refinancing operations to 
fixed-rate auctions for unlimite d amounts at its target rate.  The ECB also announced that 
it would accept foreign-currency-denominated debt  instruments issued in the euro area as 
collateral, and that it would provide Swiss-franc-denominat ed funding acquired via a new 
swap arrangement with the SNB.  The Bank of England, for its pa rt, restructured its 
discount window operations and made permanent the availability of long-term repurchase 
agreements against an expanded range of collateral.      
The major currencies index of the dollar has risen 7¾ percent on net since the time of the 
September Greenbook, as the dollar appeared to benefit from the global decrease in risk 
appetite.  The dollar appreciat ed about 16 percent against th e Canadian dollar, 9 percent 
versus the euro, and 7 percent against sterli ng, but it depreciated 8 percent versus the yen, 
with the yen’s strength apparently tied to  a rapid unwinding of carry trade positions.  
Confirming this view, the dolla r appreciated 19 percent against the Australian dollar and 
12 percent versus the New Zealand dollar, both currencies that are widely used as 
investment currencies for yen carry trades.  Implied volatilities in most currency pairs 
rose to multi-year highs, making hedging curr ency risk far more costly.       
Interest rates on sovereign bonds  in industrial countries exhi bited substantial volatility; 
nominal yield curves steepened on net, as 2-year yields declined while 10-year yields 
were mixed.  Ten-year indexed yields rose sh arply, leading to large decreases in observed 
IV-16 
 
  implied inflation compensation in the industrial countries.  However, most analysts 
believed this decrease partia lly reflected concerns about  the liquidity of indexed 
securities.   
Asset prices in emerging market economies experienced an extremely high level of 
volatility in the second half of the period.  Equity indexes have dropped about 20 percent 
on net in Brazil and Mexico since the September Greenbook, and almost 30 percent in 
Hong Kong and Thailand.  Sovereign credit de fault swap premiums rose sharply, leading 
several countries to postpone sc heduled sales of debt.   A num ber of countries introduced 
or increased guarantees on bank deposits  (Hong Kong, for instance, guaranteed all 
deposits through 2010), injected capital into lo cal institutions, or, like Brazil, provided 
access to U.S. dollar liquidity via foreign ex change swaps. The do llar appreciated about 
10 percent overall against the currencies of our  other important trading partners over the 
period.  Most notably, the dollar rose about 30 percent against the Brazilian real, the 
Mexican peso, and the Korean won, despite repo rts of heavy intervention sales of dollars 
by the monetary authorit ies of these countries.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Since the last Greenbook, incoming data fo r the advanced foreign economies have 
generally surprised on the downside of our already weak expe ctations.  Across the major 
industrial economies, confidence indicators ha ve dropped dramatically in recent months 
as the financial crisis and economic prosp ects have worsened.  Indicators of housing 
markets and credit availability point to further slowing, and labor market conditions, 
outside of Canada, have worsened.  In addi tion, trade data suggest less support from the 
export sector in the third qua rter for most of the major foreign industrial economies.  
These developments generally preceded the inte nsification of the global financial crisis in 
September, but almost certainly reflected the deterioration in credit and financial 
conditions ongoing in the months up until then. 
Inflation continues to be elev ated in the major advanced foreign economies, but the most 
recent CPI data for Japan and the euro area hi nt at a deceleration.  Excluding all food and 
energy prices, inflation generally remains we ll contained, though this measure for the 
United Kingdom has picked up.  Poor incoming economic data, combined with the recent 
sharp decline in commodity prices and significant wors ening of global financial 
conditions, led to policy rate cuts in all the advanced foreign economies except Japan and 
to a number of extraordinary measures to support domestic banking institutions.

 Since the last Greenbook, euro area  data have shown furt her economic slowing.  
Purchasing managers’ indexes fell deeper into  contractionary terr itory in September, 
credit growth continued to moderate, and ne t exports weakened.  Real retail sales for 
August rose 0.1 percent, but the trend rema ins negative.  Average industrial production 
for July-August was 0.3 percent below that in the second quarter,  despite a sizable 
increase in industrial production in August.  The August unemployment rate moved up to 
7.5 percent.  After peaking at 4 percent in July, twelve-month euro-area consumer price inflation fell back further to 3.6 percent in Se ptember, as fuel and food prices moderated.  
Excluding energy and unprocessed food prices (the ECB’s core measure), inflation was 2.5 percent.  Excluding all food and fuel prices, inflation was below 2 percent. 
After keeping policy rates on hol d at its October 2 meeting fo r the third month in a row, 
the European Central Bank participated in th e recent coordinated policy action with other 
central banks and reduced policy rates 50 basis points, to 3.75 percent.  The central bank 
stated that the downside risks to growth have  increased in response to the recent financial 
developments while the upside risk  to inflation had diminished. 
Several major European countries have announc ed measures to strengthen their banking 
systems.  On October 7, the members of the European Union announced an increase in 
the guarantee on households’ bank deposits from €20,000 to €50,000, with a number of countries choosing to raise the guarantee even higher.  Moreover, many governments 
have introduced guarantees on new issuance of debt by credit institutions.  Authorities have also instituted funds to provide banks with additional equity.  The combined rescue packages provided by France, Germany, and Sp ain alone amounted to almost €1 trillion. 
The smaller euro-area members also came unde r strain over the intermeeting period.  In 
particular, incoming data for Austria confir med economic weakness, and the central bank 
is now expecting flat GDP in the third and f ourth quarters.  The Au strian banking sector 
has been under considerable stress recentl y, largely due to its exposure to emerging 
European countries and Iceland.  On October 17, a consortium of banks together with the 
government announced a €450 million intervention in favor of the private bank Constantia, which had reported large losses.  For the Netherlands, available data indicate that the economy is faring moderately bette r, however, recent tensions in financial 
markets have significantly affected the banking sector.  Between the partial nationalization of Fortis and the capital injection into ING, the Dutch government has 
already spent almost €27 billion, or 5 percent of the country's GDP, to support banks.  The Belgian government participated with France and Luxemburg in the €6.4 billion 
IV-25 
 
 
 
 
 rescue of Dexia SA.  Belgian authorities later injected €1.5 billion into a mutual 
insurance company with la rge exposure to Dexia SA. 
Conditions worsened considerably elsewhere in Europe as well.  In Switzerland, the 
central bank joined the c oordinated action on October 8, cutting its policy rates and 
stating that recent indicators pointed to a mo re severe economic slowdown.  A week later, 
the central bank announced a rescue plan for Credit Suisse and UBS in order to improve 
their capitalization.  In the Nordic countries, economic grow th is at a standstill and 
financial institutions have come under incr easing pressure, in part reflecting their 
exposure to the Baltic countries.  In res ponse, governments have taken a number of 
measures to support banks, including capital injections, increasing liquidity, and raising 
deposit guarantees. 
In early October, the governme nt of Iceland was forced to take over the country’s three 
largest banks (with to tal foreign currency liabilities of  roughly nine times GDP).  The 
failure of these institutions contributed to th e collapse of Iceland’s foreign exchange and 
stock markets.  Iceland is in discussions with the IMF and several foreign governments 
regarding a rescue package.  Hungary, too, came under pressure over concerns about its 
ability to finance its considerable foreign currency liabilities, and in the past week has 
negotiated a €5 billion repo fac ility with the European Cent ral Bank, hiked its policy rate 
3 percentage points to support th e currency, and entered into discussions with the IMF.  
Credit default swaps have risen significantly  for Romania, Bulgaria, and the Baltic 
countries reflecting their re liance on Western European parent bank funding and their 
very large external financing requirements in the face of weakening global demand and tightening credit conditions.

 In the United Kingdom , real GDP growth in the sec ond quarter was revised down to 
zero, and incoming data suggest a contraction of  activity in the thir d quarter.  Industrial 
production declined for a sixth consecutive m onth in August.  The labor market, which 
had been resilient unt il a few months ago, is deterior ating rapidly.  The number of 
persons employed fell 72,000 in July, a m onthly drop last matched during the 1991 
recession.  Although the volume of retail sales gr ew in July and August, it remained near 
its second-quarter average. 
Banks and building societies ha ve retrenched considerably  from mortgage lending over 
the past few months.  In August, the va lue and number of loans approved for house 
purchases stood at only a quarter of year-earlier levels.  Hous e prices fell over 12 percent 
in the 12 months ended September. The 12-month rate of headline inflation clim bed to 5.2 percent in September, pushed up 
by hikes in natural gas and electricity prices.  Inflation excluding food and energy rose to 
2.2 percent, its fastest pace si nce 1996.  Core inflation has been pushed up by the prices 
of some imported goods, such as computers,  clothing, and footwear.  Although inflation 
expectations have increased noticeably, wage  inflation remains subdued; the index of 
earnings including bonuses rose 3.2 percent in the 12 months ended August. On October 8, along with other major central ba nks, the Bank of England cut the official 
interest rate 50 basis points to 4.5 percent.  U.K. authorities have also announced a series 
of measures to strengthen their banking system.  On October 7, deposit insurance 
coverage was expanded to 100 percent of th e first £50,000 of claim.  The next day, the 
government announced a program to guarantee new bank debt issued by  
U.K-incorporated banks with a substantial presence in the United Kingdom as well as by 
building societies.  The government also made  available £50 billion to assist banks in 
increasing their Tier 1 capital through the sale of equity.  On October 13, the government 
announced capital injections into the R oyal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS 
totaling £37 billion.

 Recent Japanese  indicators point to continued wea kness in the third quarter, after a 
downwardly revised 3 percent (annual rate) decline in s econd-quarter GDP.  Third-
quarter survey measures suggest that household spending has generally been anemic, and 
consumer and business sentiment posted furt her sharp declines.  Industrial production 
plummeted in August as did new manufacturi ng orders, and real export growth fell 
sharply as well.  The unemployment rate ro se to 4.2 percent in August, and the job 
openings-to-applicants ratio (t he number of officially poste d job openings relative to the 
number of officially registered job seekers) for June hit its lowest level in over three years. 
Japanese consumer prices rose 2.1 percen t over the 12 months ended August, a touch 
down from the July figure, reflecting a s light moderation in food and energy price 
inflation.  Consumer prices, excluding food a nd energy prices, were unchanged from last 
year. In the face of the recent financial turmoil, the Bank of Japan held its policy rate at 
0.5 percent but announced a series of steps on October 14 to alleviate liquidity pressures 
in short-term funding markets in coordina tion with the finance ministry.  The Bank 
expanded the list of Japanese government bonds it will accept as collateral in repurchase 
operations; the list now includes floating-rate , inflation-indexed, and 30-year government 
bonds.  It also halved the minimum-fee rates to 0.5 percent for these operations and will 
also increase the frequency and size of commer cial paper repo operations in an effort to 
facilitate corporate financing.  Finally, the Bank announced it will conduct biweekly 
auctions of U.S. dollar funds at a fixed rate  against pooled collater al through the end of 
2008.

 In Canada , indicators suggest GDP might have cont racted in the thir d quarter.  Although 
real GDP by industry advanced a robust 0.7 pe rcent in July, consumer spending was flat 
after falling in the two prev ious months.  Manufacturing shipments collapsed in August, 
and retail sales fell slightly.  Housing starts  dropped 8 percent in September and were 
down 22 percent over the past ye ar.  Exports continued their trend decline in August, and 
imports plunged, suggesting weakening domestic demand.  On the positive side, data through September indicate an ongoing broad-based expansion in Canadian employment. 
Canadian consumer price inflation edged up further to 3.6 percent over the 12 months 
ended August, supported by still-strong gain s in food and energy prices.  Inflation, 
excluding all food and energy, was lower at 1.1 percent. 
The Bank of Canada lowered its overnight ta rget interest rate from 3 percent to 
2.5 percent on October 8 as part of the coor dinated rate reducti on by several advanced 
economies, and an additional 25 basis poi nts at its scheduled policy meeting on 
October 21.  Also in October, Canadian  officials announced plans to purchase 
C$25 billion of mortgages (insured by the government-owned Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation) from banks for the stated purpose of maintaining available longer-
term credit.  The Bank of Canada also increa sed the size of its term lending facility from 
C$8 billion to C$20 billion and widened the range of acceptable assets for collateral.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Since the time of the September Greenbook, the financial market crisis has engulfed the 
emerging market economies, causing sharp falls in equity prices, depreciations of their 
currencies, and increases in credit spreads.  In addition to pressures from liquidation of 
emerging market assets by global investors, cu rrencies of some countries suffered from 
increased demand from local residents to meet their foreign currency-denominated 
obligations.  Most central banks  around the emerging market wo rld joined efforts to ease 
financial strains either by loosening moneta ry policy or by deployi ng their reserves to 
provide funding: China, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong cut interest rates; India lowered 
banks’ reserve requirements; and Brazil, Mexi co, and Russia increased dollar sales.  In 
addition, Korea announced a bank rescue plan, and several governments increased 
guarantees on bank deposits. 
Recent economic indicators–which predate the mo st recent period of intensified turmoil– 
show continued slowing in emerging market economies.  Industrial production contracted 
in many economies, including Mexico, Brazil, Ch ina, and Korea in July and August.  In 
many emerging economies, external balances ha ve deteriorated significantly, as a result 
of slowdowns in exports to advanced economie s.  In China, however, the trade surplus 
has increased sharply.  The latest data i ndicate that the headline inflation in the 
developing world has begun to ease, re flecting falling oil and food prices. 
In China, economic activity slowed sharply in the third quarter.  China reported that real 
GDP was 9 percent higher in th e third quarter than a year earlier, and the staff estimates 
that real GDP expanded 4.3 percent (seasona lly adjusted annual rate), down about 
5½ percentage points from the second quarter.  Industrial production contracted considerably as heavy industry around Beijing was shut down to lessen pollution during the Olympics and steel production slowed, refl ecting weakness in the construction sector.  
The trade surplus, however, widened significan tly in the third quarter as exports grew 
robustly and imports were roughl y flat.  Domestic demand continues to grow at a rapid 
pace, with retail sales in August up 23 percent from a year earlier.  Headline inflation in 
China fell to 4.6 percent in September on a 12-month basis after peaking at nearly 
9 percent in February.  The rise  and fall in headline inflation ma inly reflects the pattern of 
food prices; nonfood price inflation ha s only risen to about 2 percent. 
As inflation has fallen and concerns regard ing the global economy have increased, China 
has shifted its focus from c ontaining price pressures to en couraging growth and ensuring 
financial stability.  Since the time of the September Greenbook, the central bank has 
IV-34 
 
 
 
 lowered the one-year lending rate 54 basis points, the one-year deposit rate 27 basis 
points, and the required reserve ratio 150 basis points for all excep t the largest banks.  
The government has also intervened to stem the fall in the stock market, which is down 
about 65 percent from its peak last Oct ober and is down about 12 percent since the 
September Greenbook.  Unlike in some other countries of developing Asia, China’s 
foreign reserves have continued to incr ease, reaching $1.9 trillion in September. 
In India economic activity continued to slow in the third quarter.  Industrial production 
contracted sharply in August, reflecting an  unexpected slowdown in manufacturing.  The 
current account deficit widened to an all-tim e high of $43 billion in the second quarter 
because of a worsening trade deficit.  The trade deficit widened further through August, as import growth considerably  outpaced export growth.  Both consumer and wholesale 
price inflation (WPI) increas ed in August, although September’s wholesale prices 
decreased for the first time in a year, sugge sting that inflation pressure is waning. 
The Bombay Stock Exchange has fallen 31 percent since the September Greenbook and is down about 50 percent this year; the rupee depreciated 9 percent against the dollar 
since the September Greenbook.  On October 10, the Reserve Bank of India decreased 
the reserve requirement for banks by 150 basis points, which was followed by an 
additional 100 basis point reduction on Octobe r 15.  The central bank will also allow 
banks to use certificate of deposits as collateral and will hold 15-day repurchase agreement auctions.  In addition, On Octobe r 17, the government took a preemptive step 
to increase confidence in the banking system by agreeing to provide an undefined amount 
IV-35 
 
 of capital to banks in order to ensure that th ey meet the capital ad equacy ratio (CAR) of 
12 percent.  Currently, nearly all bank s have CARs of at least 10 percent.

1 Newly-industrialized economies: Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan In the NIEs1, economic activity appears to have slowed significantly, reflecting both 
weaker external demand from the advanced eco nomies and disruptions in global financial 
markets.  Through the first two months of the third quarter, industrial production 
contracted in Korea and Taiwan and was about  flat in Singapore.  The preliminary GDP 
release for Singapore indicated that the ec onomy continued to contract in the third 
quarter.  In Taiwan and Korea, trade ba lances worsened significantly, with both 
economies moving from sizable surpluses in th e second quarter to de ficits.  The trade 
balance remained about flat in Singapore in recent months.  Inflation appears to have 
peaked in the NIEs, with a ll four economies registering declines.  Hong Kong’s 12-month 
inflation fell to 4.5 percent in August, and Taiwanese inflation fe ll to 3.1 percent in 
September. 
The financial market turmoil has affected stoc k markets in these economies considerably.  
Taiwan has announced several measures, includi ng direct intervention in the market, to 
help support equity prices.  In addition, there have been reports of tightening liquidity in 
the interbank lending markets.  Hong Kong, following a run on the Bank of East Asia, 
instituted several measures designed to increase inter-bank liquid ity.  Also, Singapore 
increased guarantees on bank deposits.  In re sponse to their slow ing economies and to 
help relieve credit pressures, the economies  have loosened monetary policy.  Since the 
previous Greenbook, Korea lowered its base ra te 25 basis points, Hong Kong lowered its 
rate 150 basis points, and Taiwan lowered its rate 37½ basis points. 
Korean markets have come under intensified pressure after St andard and Poor's 
announced that it may lower credit ratings fo r major Korean banks, reflecting the banks 
facing a currency funding pressures and concerns about asset quality.  Since September 
Greenbook, the won has depreciated about 29 per cent against the dolla r, despite reports 
of heavy foreign exchange intervention, and the stock market has fallen 23 percent.  
Officials in Korea announced on Octobe r 18 that the government will guarantee 
$100 billion of foreign currency debt and that it will inject $30 billion into banks by drawing on its $240 billion of foreign exchange re serves.  This rescue package, which is 
the largest announced so far in  Asia, amounts to 14 percent of Korea’s GDP.  According 
to the official announcement, all new extern al debt issued by Korean banks through 
June 30, 2009 will be guaranteed for 3 years by the government.  The plan also called for the investment of a trillion won (about $758 million) into the Industrial Bank of Korea, 
which aims to make approximately 12 trillion won (about $9 billion) in loans to small- 
IV-38 
 
 
 
 
 
  and mid-sized businesses.  Additionally, the government will provide about $4 billion in 
aid to the country’s troubl ed real estate sector.

 Data from the ASEAN-4  region indicate that economic growth softened in the third 
quarter.  Industrial producti on fell in Indonesia and Malays ia but remained relatively 
robust for the Philippines and Thailand.  Exports have declined in the region, 
accompanied by a buildup of inventories.  Twelve-month inflation decreased significantly in the Philippines and Thailand but rose in Indonesia and Malaysia.  In 
response, Bank Indonesia raised policy rates 25 basis points to 9.5 percent on October 6 
despite the ongoing financial turmoil. 
To alleviate liquidity constraints on banks stemming from the financial turmoil, Bank 
Indonesia doubled the amount of deposits guaranteed by the government and began 
allowing commercial banks to use performing loans as collateral for loans from the 
central bank.  Both the Philippines and Malays ia have indicated th at their banks do not 
have insolvency problems.  EMBI spreads have increased markedly in both Indonesia 
and the Philippines since the September Gree nbook.  Equity prices fell sharply in all 
countries.  Indonesia halted share trading on Wednesday, October 8, and did not reopen 
trading until the following Monday.

 In Mexico , data point to a continued slowing of real activity.  Industr ial production fell in 
July, and auto production declined 4.7 per cent in August.  Automobile exports fell 
14.7 percent in August as demand weakened in the United States.  Retail sales have 
slowed considerably in the fi rst two months of the third quarter.  Headline and core 
inflation had remained elevated, reflec ting high food and energy price inflation.  
However, recent declines in commodity pr ices, rising unemployment, and weakening 
domestic demand began to lessen infl ationary pressures in September. 
The Mexican peso and the stock market have  lost significant value since the September 
Greenbook.  Reports suggest that in additi on to global investors’ broader-based 
liquidation of emerging market assets, Mexi co’s currency came under strong pressure by 
increasing demand from local i nvestors and companies in need of dollars to meet dollar-
denominated payments.  Some companie s had large losses on foreign exchange 
derivatives.  On October 8, the Bank of Mexi co (BOM) auctioned $2.5 billion to stabilize 
the peso after it fell nearly 14 percent, the biggest intraday drop since the 1994 
devaluation.  With BOM’s aggressive atte mpt to shore up the peso, Mexico’s foreign 
exchange reserves have fallen 13.3 percen t to $73 billion since the September 
Greenbook.

 In Brazil, incoming data have been mixed, but anecdotal evidence points to a sharp 
deterioration in economic condi tions in recent weeks.  In August, formal unemployment 
declined and capacity utilization rates remained high.  However, August industrial 
production declined, reversing the rise in July.  August retail sales were 10 percent above their year-earlier level, but auto sales declin ed in the third quarter after two quarters of 
rapid growth.  Monthly consumer price infl ation continued to d ecline, reflecting the 
waning of food price pressures. 
Brazil has been hit especially hard by the recent deterioration in financial conditions.  
The Bovespa equity index, which has been ve ry volatile, has declin ed sharply.  Reports 
suggest that access to dollar interbank funding by Brazilian banks has been severely 
curtailed, and consider able net capital outflows have occurred through mid-October.  
Following the sizable depreciation of the real in late September, two large companies 
announced large losses on foreign exchange  derivatives, and it is rumored that many 
firms could be confronting major losses.  Sm all- and medium-size banks have also been 
facing funding pressures in the local currency interbank market.  There have been some 
signs that the financial pressures have resu lted in sharp curtailment of personal and 
corporate credit, and there have been reports th at investment plans ha ve been scaled back 
considerably. The Brazilian government and central bank have taken several steps to alleviate dollar 
and real  funding pressures.  Measures to increase dollar liquidity have included one-
month repurchase agreement, dollar swaps, and some intervention sales of foreign exchange.  The central bank relaxed reserve requirements several times with the aim of 
alleviating funding pressures for smaller ba nks.  The central bank has indicated its 
willingness to acquire credit portfolios of sm aller banks, and large banks are reported to 
have acquired some credit portfolios.  Earl y this morning, (Octobe r 22), the Brazilian 
government granted the central bank the author ity to enter into swap agreements with 
other central banks.  The government also approved a number of measures that enable government banks to acquire problem banks a nd non-bank financial institutions.  Despite 
the financial turmoil, Central Bank President Meirelles indicated that the central bank may continue to raise its policy rate at  the next meeting on October 29 to curb 
inflationary pressures.

 In Argentina , economic activity strengthened in the third quarter foll owing a resolution 
to the conflict between farmers and the govern ment over a proposal to tax exports.  The 
trade surplus surged owing to a sharp increa se in commodity exports.  Headline consumer 
price inflation remained around 9 percent in th e third quarter, but the reliability of the 
official inflation data remains questionable.  The Argentinean stock market fell 
26 percent since the September Greenbook with an especially large drop occurring on 
news that government may try to nationalize the nation’s private pension assets in an 
effort to avoid defaulting on external obligations, pendi ng congressional approval.  
However, the exchange rate was affected only moderately; following increased intervention by the Central Bank of Argentina, the peso depreciated only 5 percent on net 
against the dollar over the intermeeting period.

 In Venezuela , the sharp decline in the price of oil, if it persists, is expected to put 
considerable stress on public finances  and the economy.  (Oil accounts for over 
90 percent of exports, about 20 percent of GDP, and roughly 50 percent of fiscal 
revenue.)  Inflation remains out of control, wi th the headline index 34 percent higher than 
a year earlier.  Venezuelan five-year credit  default swap spreads have soared over the 
past month and stand now at over 1,800 bp.  The bolivar is pegged to the dollar and is supported by capital controls.  The parallel market exchange rate  stands at 5,400/dollar 
versus the official exchange rate of 2,144/dollar.

  In Russia, economic activity has slowed considerab ly.  Industrial pr oduction growth was 
4.7 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the third quarter, down from 5.5 percent 
in the second quarter.  Growth of fixed investment and constr uction both approached 
three-year lows.  Meanwhile, inflation in Ru ssia remains elevated; twelve-month inflation 
in September was 14.9 percent.  Wages continue to soar; August nominal wages rose 33.1 percent while real wages ro se 15.7 percent.  Unemployment remains historically low 
at 5.3 percent as of August, adding to inflationary pressures. 
Russia’s financial system has been under consid erable stress, as the international crisis 
highlighted the corporate sector’s dependence on foreign borrowing.  The Russian RTS 
stock exchange fell about 48 percent sinc e the September Greenbook.  The Central Bank 
of Russia (CBR) is believed to have sold around $33 billion in reserv es since August 8 to 
support the ruble, bringing reserves down to  $530 billion from a peak of $600 billion last 
summer.  The Mosprime overnight interbank rate (for the largest banks) spiked to 
21 percent on October 20 before coming down below 8 percent in recent days, and interbank lending to smaller banks appears to  have dried up.  In response, the Russian 
government made funds available for the la rge government-owned banks (which account 
for over half of system retail deposits) to lend to smaller banks, but as of October 10, 
only an estimated $90 billion of the pledged $245 billion has reached the banking sector.  
The CBR plans to compensate large banks fo r losses incurred in th e interbank market. 
A number of other emerging economies have also come under si gnificant pressure as 
their access to international capital markets has become significantly impaired.  These 
include Kazakhstan, Pakistan, South Africa, Ukraine, and United Arab Emirates.  For some countries, political uncertainties have  exacerbated the impact of the financial 
turmoil.
