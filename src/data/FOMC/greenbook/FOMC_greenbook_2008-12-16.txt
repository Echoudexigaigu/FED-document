1 Excluding the effects of the Boeing strike, payrolls fell 335,000 in October and 567,000 in 
November. Recent data on spending and production show dete rioration in almost every sector of the 
economy.  Conditions in the labor market have worsened markedly as job losses have 
accelerated and the unemployment rate has ju mped.  Consumer spending has recorded 
large and broad-based declin es in recent months, and th e ongoing deterioration in 
consumer fundamentals provides little evidence that demand will stabilize in the near term.  At the same time, the housing market remains exceptionally weak, and residential 
construction activity has continued its steep decline.  In the business sector, the 
contraction in real spending on equipment and software appears to have gathered 
momentum and broadened in scope, and nonres idential building cons truction has turned 
down.  Excluding the effects of the Sept ember hurricanes and the Boeing strike, 
industrial production has registered large and widespread declines since July.  
Plummeting energy prices led to a drop in head line PCE prices in October, and core PCE 
prices also decelerated noticeably through October. 
Labor Market Developments 
Conditions in the labor market took another tu rn for the worse in November after having 
deteriorated sharply earlier in the fall.  Private nonfarm  payroll employment plunged 
540,000 last month after losses averaging a bout 370,000 in September and October and 
about 100,000 per month over the first eight months of the year.
 1  The quickening pace of 
job losses over the past three months was wi despread across industries, as each of the 
manufacturing, construction, retail, financial activities, and business services sectors 
experienced substantial declin es in payrolls.  The averag e workweek of production and 
nonsupervisory workers continued to move lo wer in November, and aggregate hours of 
production workers fell 0.9 percent last month to a level 1.4 percent (not at an annual 
rate) below their third-quarter average. 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te jumped to 6.5 percent in October and 
rose further to 6.7 percent in November—its  highest level since 1993.  The fraction of 
workers who are working part time for econom ic reasons, another indicator of labor 
market slack, continued its steep ascent last month and now stands 2 percentage points 
above its level at the end of last year.  In addition, the labor force participat ion rate fell

2 The extension of unemployment insurance benefits, which has induced workers to remain in the labor 
force, likely helped support the labor force participati on rate in the face of diminished job opportunities.  
Reflecting this influence, we estimate that the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program boosted 
the level of the published unemployment rate about 0.3 percentage point in October and 0.2 percentage point in November. 
3 The pattern of continuing EUC claims reflects the large number of claimants who began receiving 
benefits when the EUC was enacted in July and who now have exhausted their 13 weeks of EUC benefits. 0.3 percentage point in Novemb er after having held up surprisingly well for much of the 
year.2 
Initial claims for unemployment insuran ce under regular state programs shot up in 
November, with the four-week moving aver age reaching 525,000 for the week ending 
November 29.  Continuing claims for regular  state unemployment insurance also rose 
steeply last month, while continuing em ergency unemployment compensation (EUC) 
claims leveled off at around 700,000 after havi ng peaked at 1.4 million in September.3 
An additional measure of job separations—the short-term job losers rate from the 
household survey—increased further in November.  In addition, announcements of downsizing plans compiled by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., rose steeply last 
month. 
Other labor market indicators suggest that jobs are in shor t supply.  The job openings rate 
as measured by the Job Openings and Labor  Turnover Survey continued its downward 
trajectory in October, and he lp-wanted advertising fell again in November.  Hiring plans 
from the National Federation of Independe nt Business (NFIB) dropped steeply in 
November, and the latest reading from Manpower , Inc., remained at a low level.  NFIB’s 
measure of hard-to-fill positions remained low, as did perceptions of current job 
availability in the Conference Board survey.  Finally, household expectations for labor 
market conditions, as reported in the Reut ers/University of Michigan and Conference 
Board surveys, have been volatile in recen t months but remain near historic lows. 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) rebounde d 1.3 percent in October af ter plunging 3.7 percent in 
September, when activity was held down by th e hurricanes and the machinists’ strike at 
Boeing.  Excluding these special factors, outpu t is estimated to have decreased about 
⅔ percent in both September and October, with  declines widespread  across industries.  
Indeed, the diffusion index of three-month ch anges in IP, which should not be greatly 
influenced by these special factors, fell in  October to its lowest level since July 1980.

4 Despite the resumption of production on November 2, Boeing delivered only four aircraft in 
November, as a faulty connector was discovered that  required each aircraft under construction to be 
inspected and the faulty connectors to be replaced (previously delivered aircraft will have these connectors 
replaced during planned maintenance).  Production rates in November, particularly of the 737, were 
reduced, although by significantly less than deliveries of completed aircraft. The available data for November, such as  manufacturing production worker hours and 
the physical product data availa ble at the weekly frequency, suggest that, aside from the 
hurricane- and strike-related rebounds in output, the pace of production declines has 
intensified.  For example, st eel production has plummeted, and industry reports suggest 
that at least one-fourth of th at industry’s domestic capacity has been idled.  Similarly, the 
output of organic chemicals, which are used fo r a variety of industria l purposes, also has 
contracted sharply. 
The return to operation of oil and gas extr action capability that had been shut down by 
the hurricanes appears to have contributed ne arly 0.4 percentage point to the rate of 
change in IP in November.  As of December 3, 15 percent of the oil extraction capability 
in the Gulf of Mexico remained offline, while about 20 percent of natural gas extraction in the Gulf was still idled.  Although capacity in most othe r hurricane-affected industries 
has come back online, production in a fe w of these industries, most notably 
petrochemicals, remains below pre-hurricane  levels, likely because of weak demand. 
The restart of commercial aircraft producti on at Boeing in early November also boosted 
IP last month.  While pre-strike assembly rates will not likely be fully achieved until 
December, the resumption of production last month likely boosted the rate of change in IP in November about 0.4 percentage point.

The output of high-technology products declin ed in the third quarter and again in 
October.  Although domestic unit sales of person al computers (PCs) rose modestly in the 
third quarter, a marked shift toward lower-end PCs yielded a decline in real output.  Unit sales of servers fell last quarter, and nominal spending on voice and data networking 
equipment was about flat for this large cate gory of communications equipment.  Declines 
in semiconductor output averaged 1¼ percen t per month over the three months ending in 
October, as weak demand and excessive inve ntories for some types of chips weighed on 
output.  Although production declines have been fairly broad based across chip types, the 
output of both flash memory and microproce ssors has been particularly weak.  In 
addition, the production of circ uit boards has declined in recent months, and orders 
continue to run below shipments.

Looking ahead, several indicators point to a fu rther weakening in high-tech output.  For 
example, survey-based measures of high-tech  capital spending plans (such as the industry 
survey by the National Association of Busine ss Economists and the Empire State survey) 
were very soft; private-sector forecasts (s uch as IDC, Gartner, and the Semiconductor 
Industry Association) have been revised dow n; and high-tech company revenue guidance 
from Cisco, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel has been very downbeat.  In particular, 
Intel sharply revised downward its projections  for fourth-quarter revenue to a level 
consistent with a substantial decline in real semiconductor ou tput this quarter, and the 
company noted unexpectedly weak demand in all geographic areas and market segments, 
including the PC supply chain.  A number of high-tech companies (including Sun 
Microsystems, National Semiconductor, and Nortel) have recently announced layoffs, 
and others (such as HP and Micron) have extended holiday shut downs.  Planned capital 
spending by semiconductor manufacturers also co ntinues to be scaled back; orders and 
shipments of semiconductor fabricating equipm ent are down more than 30 percent from 
their year-earlier levels. 
Excluding energy, motor vehicles, aircraft, a nd high-tech products, production in other 
market groups weakened considerably in September and October, although the monthly 
pattern has been affected by the hurricanes.  The pace of declines steepened for a variety 
of consumer durables, such as appliances, furniture, and products related to home 
improvement.  The output of construction suppl ies resumed falling after a brief pause in 
the middle of the year, and declines in th e production of materials intensified, which 
likely reflected a widening of the weakne ss in demand for materials beyond the motor 
vehicle-related and constr uction-related sectors. 
The available forward-looking i ndicators of manufacturing activity suggest significant 
contractions in manufacturing output in coming months.   The three-month moving 
average of the staff’s measure of real ad justed durable goods orders plummeted in 
October, and the new orders indexes from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the regional surveys plunged to excepti onally low levels between September and 
November.  In addition, recent data and indica tors of trade, such as the ISM new export 
orders index and the JPMorgan Global new orders index, suggest that foreign demand, 
which had boosted domestic production consider ably over the past year, is no longer 
providing much impetus to IP. 
Regarding capacity in manufacturing, the ISM's semiannual diffusion index of capital 
spending plans by manufacturers, which correl ates well historically  with manufacturing 
investment, fell to 28.0 for 2009, its lowest leve l since the series’ in ception in 1961.  This

measure, together with the low current ope rating rates in manuf acturing, points to a 
sizable drop in capital spending by manuf acturers next year that would leave 
manufacturing capacity little changed in 2009 after it had in creased 1¾ percent this year. 
Motor Vehicles 
Sales of automobiles and light trucks collap sed to an annual rate of 10.5 million units in 
October and fell further in November to a 10.1 million unit rate, more than 2 million units 
below September’s already anemic pace.   
 domestic nameplates , in particular, lost market share. 
The sharp weakening in automobile demand likely reflects stagnant incomes, declining 
household wealth, and concerns about the ove rall economy.  Credit conditions also have 
remained unfavorable, as some automakers have  continued to restrict leasing activity and 
financing has remained very difficult to come  by for borrowers with low credit ratings.  
Indeed, an unusually high percentage of respondents to the Reuters/Michigan Survey 
reported that tight credit c onditions made it a bad time to buy a car in October and 
November.  Overall, however, the Reuters/ Michigan Survey’s measure of car-buying 
attitudes improved slightly, re flecting lower gas prices a nd, with the most generous 
consumer incentives in years, a greater number of consumers who view ed prices as being 
low. 
Light vehicle assemblies stepped down in November to an annual rate of 7¼ million units 
after having averaged a paltry  8.0 million units over the previous three months.  Even 
with these cutbacks, the level of vehicle in ventories has crept up in recent months.  
Although the level is still relatively low by hist orical standards, the anemic pace of sales 
pushed days’ supply to around 100 days in October and November, well above the 
automakers’ desired levels.  In response, automakers have announced that they now 
expect to continue production at a very low annual rate of just under 7¾ million units for 
the next four months. 
Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending has recorded large and broad-based declines in recent months.  Real 
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) fell 0.5 percent in October, the fifth 
consecutive monthly decline, with weakne ss evident in nearly  all broad spending 
categories.  In addition to the aforementioned dr op in light vehicle sales, real spending on 
goods other than motor vehicles plunged at an annual rate of more th an 9 percent over the 
three months ending in October.  The pace of spending on services also weakened through October with the three-month increase, at an annual rate of 0.6 percent, down

considerably from the 1¼ percen t increase in the fi rst half of 2008.  The latest readings 
on chain store sales suggest that spending on goods declined further in November.  
However, U.S. Department of Energy data  for October and November suggest that 
overall fourth-quarter spending will recei ve a modest boost from a bounceback in real 
spending on gasoline, likely relate d to the recent price declines. 
Consumer demand fundamentals have shown lit tle improvement of late.  The one bright 
note has been the boost to real income provided by the sharp reversal in energy prices; in 
October, despite the sizable employment d eclines, the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
reported that real disposable income increased  $86 billion.  Continued declines in equity 
and house prices likely have pushed the ratio of wealth to income down further, and 
measures of consumer sentiment from th e Reuters/University of Michigan and 
Conference Board surveys remained at recession ary levels in November.  In addition, the 
available evidence suggests a considerable further tightening in consumer credit 
conditions in recent months. 
Housing  
Housing activity continued its steep descent ear ly in the fourth quarter.  In October, 
single-family housing starts moved down 3 percent, and adjusted permit issuance—a 
useful month-ahead indicator of starts—plunge d to a level more than 11 percent below 
starts.  So far this year, single-family starts have fallen at an annual rate of 37 percent, the 
same rate of decline as in 2007.  Multifamily starts fell to 260,000 units in October, a value near the lower end of the range occupied over the past two years. 
Housing demand remains very weak.  The Census Bureau’s measure of new single-
family home sales fell 5 percent in October and has declined at  an annual rate of 
32 percent so far this year.  Although th e number of unsold new single-family homes 
continued to move lower in October—indee d, the stock has declined by one-third since 
its peak in mid-2006—inventories remained ex tremely elevated relative to the current 
pace of sales. 
By contrast, sales of existing single-family homes changed little, on balance, for the year 
ending in October, although a step-down in  pending home sales in October points to 
further declines in existing home sales in the near term.  The comparative strength of

5 Estimates of foreclosure-related sales (based on data on foreclosure starts and inventories) suggest 
that non-foreclosure-related sales declined about 10 pe rcent (not at an annual rate) over the first three 
quarters of 2008.  Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate 
agents, most foreclosure-related sales are included in the existing home sales statistics because banks 
frequently hire real estate agents to sell a property  after obtaining ownership through a public foreclosure 
auction. 
6 Unlike the FHFA index (formerly known as the OFHEO index), the LoanPerformance (LP) index 
includes both conforming and nonconforming loans.  In addition, the LP index has better geographic 
coverage than the S&P/Case-Shiller (CS) index.  Th e LP and CS indexes showed similar movements from 
2002 to 2007, but more recently the LP index has declined by less than the CS index.  existing home sales is partly attributable to increases in foreclos ure-related and other 
distressed sales, which tend to be sold at much lower prices than owner-occupied homes.5 
Financing conditions for prime borrowers ha ve eased lately, as rates for conforming 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell 50 basis poi nts in late November after the Federal 
Reserve’s announced decision to purchase agency debt to support mortgage financing.  In 
early December, the nominal 30-year fixed mo rtgage rate was lower than it had been 
since 2005 (except for a short-lived dip in early 2008).  Meanwhile, the market for 
nonconforming loans (that is, loans that canno t be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie 
Mac) remains severely impaired.  Although the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
has offered an alternative source of mortgage finance for some nonprime and near-prime borrowers, FHA’s relatively strict lending st andards and higher cost s suggest that such 
lending is likely to have replaced only a sma ll part of the reduction in credit from other 
sources. 
House prices remain on a downward trajector y.  For existing homes, the repeat-sales 
price index calculated by LoanPerformance—a recently developed index that we think is 
more representative than either the Fe deral Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) or 
S&P/Case-Shiller indexes—decreased 10 per cent over the 12 months ending in October.
6  
Although these lower prices are making homes more affordable, survey evidence and 
anecdotal reports suggest that expectations of further house price declines remain quite 
prevalent, a consideration that may make many potential buyers reluctant to purchase 
homes until prices show signs of stabilizing. 
Equipment and Software 
After having fallen at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent in th e third quarter, real spending 
on equipment and software (E&S) appears to be contracting at an even faster rate so far 
in the fourth quarter.  Moreover, while the downturn last quarter was concentrated in 
computers and transportation equipment, this quarter’s decline in sp ending appears to be 
more widespread.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft tumbled in

October, and orders continued to plunge.  Orders have d eclined more than 10 percent 
since July and were well below shipments in  October, pointing to further declines in 
shipments in coming months. 
Investment demand appears to have been  weighed down by weak fundamentals and 
heightened uncertainty about the future cour se of the economy.  Business output turned 
down noticeably in the third quarter, and pros pects for business activity, as reflected in 
surveys of business conditions and sentiment, have become considerably gloomier in 
recent months.  In addition, credit conditions remain tight, with corporate bond yields 
high, essentially no speculative-grade issuance, and widespread anecdotal reports of firms 
facing a challenging credit environment.  A ccording to the ISM semiannual report and 
other recent surveys, these adverse developm ents have apparently led to aggressive 
cutbacks in businesses’ capital spending plans. 
Real outlays for transportation equipment continued to sink in the third quarter and so far 
in the fourth quarter.  Real purchases of aircraft dropped sh arply in the third quarter as 
the machinists’ strike caused Boeing to make only a fraction of its planned deliveries in 
September.  Aircraft purchases appear to ha ve remained low so far this quarter; Boeing 
made no deliveries in October, and deliverie s in November were severely limited by the 
aforementioned problem with a faulty connect or.  Meanwhile, business purchases of light 
vehicles fell sharply in October and Novemb er, and although sales of medium and heavy 
trucks were little changed in  those two months, orders for these trucks tumbled in 
October, a sign that purchases will  move lower in the period ahead. 
Real spending on high-tech E&S dropped in the third quarter as a result of a sharp decline in outlays on computers and peripherals.  Software companies also reported considerable revenue losses in the third quarter.  High-tech  spending appears to ha ve entered the fourth 
quarter on a similarly weak note, as industrial production of  computers and shipments of 
high-tech equipment fell again in October.  Th ese data are consistent with reports from 
several producers of high-tech equipment of a pullback in business demand for their 
products. 
Nonresidential construction 
Real nonresidential investment (other than drilling and mining) d eclined in the third 
quarter after nearly three years of robust  expansion, and nominal expenditures edged 
down further in October.  The downturn in th is sector is consistent with weakening 
fundamentals.  Vacancy rates rose and property values fell in the first three quarters of 
the year.  In addition, surveys of loan offi cers through October, and anecdotal reports

more recently, suggest that financing for ne w construction projects has become extremely 
difficult to acquire.  The architectural bill ings index dropped again in October, an 
indication of further deteriora tion in nonresidential investment  in the future.  Moreover, 
declines in nonresidential construction em ployment have accelera ted considerably in 
recent months. 
The latest readings on footage drilled and the number of drilling rigs in operation suggest 
that real expenditures on dril ling and mining structures decele rated sharply in the fourth 
quarter.  The recent deceleration likely reflects the sizable drop in oil and natural gas prices since July. 
Business Inventories  
Firms continued to draw down their inventory stocks at a fast pace in the third quarter, 
and book-value data for manufacturing and whol esale trade (other than motor vehicles) 
point to further drawdowns in October.  Despit e firms’ attempts to keep their inventories 
under control, stocks in some industries appear to have move d above desired levels.  In 
particular, the ratio of book-value inventorie s to sales in the manufacturing and trade 
sectors, excluding motor vehicles, moved up in August and September, and this ratio 
continued to rise at the manu facturing and wholesale levels in October.  Months’ supply 
in the flow-of-goods system edged down in October after having risen in September, 
when shipments in some industries (such aer ospace and shipbuilding) were temporarily 
disrupted by the hurricanes and the strike at Boeing.  That said, this measure of months’ 
supply seems somewhat elevated for durable  goods excluding transportation equipment 
and is clearly elevated for some nondurable s industries, such as  plastics and rubber 
products.  Finally, the ISM index of customer s’ inventories remained above 50 for the 
fourth consecutive month in November, an indication that many purchasing managers see 
their customers’ inve ntories as too high. 
Federal Go
vernment Sector  
The deficit in the federal unified budget c ontinued to widen markedly in October and 
November.  Receipts in the pa st two months, adjusted fo r payment-timing shifts and 
financial transactions, fell 6 percent relative  to the same period a year earlier, with 
declines recorded for both personal and co rporate tax payments.  The reduction in 
receipts likely reflects the slower rise in nominal personal incomes, reduced capital gains 
realizations, and declining prof its for corporations.  On th e expenditure side, adjusted 
outlays in October and November increased 10 pe rcent relative to the same period a year

7 These adjusted outlay figures exclude financial transactions and so do not include the equity 
purchases related to the Troubled Assets Relief Progr am (TARP) or the government-sponsored enterprise 
(GSE) equity purchase program for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  In October and November, TARP-
related equity purchases totaled $192 billion, while GSE-related equity purchases equaled $14 billion.  The 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) scores both types of transactions as outlays in the unadjusted unified federal budget.  Including these transactions in federal outlays significantly increases the budget 
deficit in the past two months (as shown by the thin line in the “Surplus or Deficit” chart and the unadjusted deficit figures in the memo line of the table).  In contrast to OMB, the Congressional Budget 
Office believes that these asset purchases should be recorded on an accrual basis and calculates that the 
present value cost of these transactions equals about $64 billion, or $142 billion less than the cash 
disbursements recorded by the Treasury. 
8 The new expansion is scheduled to expire in March 2009, along with the original EUC benefit 
program. 
9 In October, 22 states plus the District of Columbia (about 58 percent of the total labor force) had 
unemployment rates at or above 6 percent. 
10 In the preliminary national income and product accounts (NIPA) release for the third quarter, the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) had estimated that real construction outlays fell at an annual rate of 
0.4 percent.  Because of the strong er construction data, we expect the BEA to raise its estimate of the 
increase in total state and local purchases from 0.8 percent to 1.4 percent. earlier.7  Spending rose for low-income support programs, which reflected the ramp-up of 
the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program and, more generally, the 
weaker economic conditions relative to a year  ago.  Meanwhile, spending for defense, 
Social Security, and Medicare continued to pos t solid gains relative to a year earlier. 
On November 21, new legislation expanded the EUC program for workers who have 
exhausted, or will exhaust, the previously available 13 weeks of EUC benefits.8  The new 
law extends EUC benefits for an additiona l 7 weeks for all eligible individuals  and a 
further 13 weeks for individuals in states with high unemployment rates—defined as a state unemployment rate of 6 percent or above.
9  This expansion of the EUC program is 
estimated to cost $6 billion. 
State and Local Government Sector 
Although state and local governments are facing mounting fiscal pressures, the incoming 
data have not yet shown a dramatic reduction in outlays.  On average, state and local 
employment rose 15,000 in October and Novemb er, about the same pace as was recorded 
over the first nine months of the year.  Meanwhile, after factoring in the sizable upward 
revisions to the data for August and Septembe r in the latest monthly construction report, 
we estimate that real constructi on outlays rose at an annual ra te of 3½ percent in the third 
quarter.10  In October (the latest available data), nominal construction spending edged up 
to a level nearly 1 percent (not at an a nnual rate) above its th ird-quarter average; 
however, given the sizable increases in the state and local construction deflator in recent

quarters, the increase in no minal spending in October probably implies little—if any—
gain in real terms. 
The state and local revenue picture remains gr im.  On the basis of information from 42 
states, the Rockefeller Institute of Government  estimated that state tax collections were 
flat in nominal terms on a year-over-year basis in the third qu arter of 2008, compared 
with an increase of 3 percen t for the preceding year.  State personal income taxes rose 
just 1½ percent over the year ending in the third quarter, wh ile sales taxes fell ¾ percent 
and corporate income taxes fell more than 8 pe rcent.  Since the end of the third quarter, 
the bad news has continued to pile up as re venues in many jurisdictions have fallen short 
of expectations and budget gaps have balloon ed.  Indeed, when surveyed by the National 
Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) in November, many states reported that 
revenues in every major category were running below projections, and some states that 
had previously enjoyed strong revenue collectio ns were scaling back  their expectations 
because of the recent declines in oil and commodity prices.  According to the NCSL, a 
number of states have already trimmed spe nding during the current fiscal year (which 
began on July 1 in most states), although more-significant budget-repair actions will 
likely be deferred until legislatures meet in  early 2009.  Actions to date have included 
across-the-board cuts in spendi ng (10 states), cuts in educa tion programs (8 states), and 
hiring freezes (19 states); 11 st ates have tapped rainy day a nd other funds to help close 
budget gaps. 
Prices  
Both headline and core consumer price infla tion slowed further in recent months.  With 
energy prices falling sharply, overall PCE prices  decreased 0.6 percen t in October after 
being little changed in August and Septem ber; over the preceding three-month period, 
overall PCE prices increased at  an annual rate of more than  7 percent.  Excluding food 
and energy, PCE prices were unchanged in Octo ber, bringing their three-month change to 
an annual rate of 1.4 percent, down from th e 2.7 percent rate of increase recorded over 
the preceding three months.  The 12-month change in core PCE prices slowed to 
2.1 percent, the same as in the year-earlier pe riod.  Meanwhile, prices of goods at earlier 
stages of production, both intermediate pr oducts and commodities, have continued to 
decline. 
Consumer energy prices continued their recent slide, falling almost 9 percent in October 
after a cumulative 5 percent decline over August and September.  Survey data suggest 
that retail gasoline prices, which dropped 13½ percent in Octo ber, fell even more sharply 
in November and the beginning of December.  Crude oil prices have also moved down

substantially since the Oct ober Greenbook, although not as sh arply as gasoline prices: 
Gasoline margins have moved down toward nor mal levels as gasoline inventories have 
begun to recover from their low levels afte r the refinery outages due to Hurricanes 
Gustav and Ike. 
In contrast, consumer food pr ices have continued to tre nd up.  Although the increase of 
0.4 percent in consumer food prices in Oct ober was less than in preceding months, the 
change was held down by price declines in the vo latile category of fruits and vegetables.  
Prices of other foods at home and of restaurant meals posted further sizable increases.  
Over the 12 months ending in October, f ood prices increased 6¼ percent after having 
risen 4¼ percent over the previ ous 12 months.  However, pr ices for most agricultural 
commodities have fallen further since the October Greenbook, and the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index of spot foods tuffs is down by more than one-third since 
early July. 
As noted, core PCE prices have continued to in crease at slower rates than they did in the 
summer, with an especially low reading in Oc tober.  Some of the more erratic categories 
of prices (such as lodging away from home and used cars) experienced especially large 
price declines in October.  But the recent slowing has genera lly been as widespread as 
was the acceleration of these prices back in the spring.  That earlier pickup in core PCE 
inflation likely reflected an acceleration in  import prices and th e pass-through of the 
previous large increases in the costs of energy and materials.  The recent reversal of these 
influences, as well as the weak pace of economic activity, likely has started to show 
through to core consumer prices, but given th e long lags of pass-th rough, the full effects 
of the recent abatement of these cost pressures may take some time to fully materialize. 
Prices at earlier stages of processing have continued to retreat.  After having risen 
significantly in each of the first eight months  of this year, the producer price index for 
core intermediate materials fell 1.7 percent in October, the second consecutive monthly 
decline.  This drop likely reflects some pa ss-through of declining commodity prices, 
which started falling in mid-July and have dr opped further since the close of the October 
Greenbook.  Since late October, the Journal of Commerce  index of industrial materials 
prices has plunged 24 percent, and the CRB index of spot industrials has fallen 
12 percent.  These two indexes now stand a bout 50 percent and 40 percent, respectively, 
below their levels in mid-July. Survey-based measures of inflation expecta tions have continued to fall or hold steady.

11 According to the productivity and cost data based on the preliminary GDP release, productivity in 
the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter.  The staff estimate is 
based on source data that became available after the GDP release.  Reuters/Michigan Survey, held at 2.9 percent in the November final release; this reading 
was down from a high of 3.4 percent in May and J une but similar to its levels from a year 
ago and within the narrow range in which it fl uctuated over the previous few years.  
Median expected inflation over the next 12 mo nths fell to 2.9 per cent in the November 
Reuters/Michigan Survey, its lo west reading of the year.  As  discussed in the “Domestic 
Financial Developments” section, Treasury infl ation-protected securities (TIPS) have 
exhibited heightened volatility in the past few months.  As a result, the staff’s measure of 
inflation compensation based on these yields is  probably not very info rmative at this time 
about movements in inflation expectati ons or in inflati on risk premiums. 
Labor Costs 
Labor cost increases have remained modera te.  The employment cost index (ECI) for 
hourly compensation of private industry work ers rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent 
over the three months ending in September.   The 12-month change in the ECI was 
2.8 percent, a little lower than  the increase seen over the preceding 12-month period.  
Similarly, compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual 
rate of 4.1 percent in the thir d quarter after a downward-revise d rise of 0.9 percent in the 
second quarter. The increase over the most recen t four quarters, at 3½ percent, was down 
1 percentage point from the increas e over the previous four quarters. 
The staff estim
ates that productivity in the nonf arm business sector rose at an annual rate 
of 1.4 percent in the third quarter.11  Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 
this year, productivity rose 2 percent, down from 2½ perc ent over the previous four 
quarters.  Combining the information on hourly output and compensation, the staff 
estimates that unit labor costs increased 1½ percent over the most recent four quarters, 
somewhat less than its average ra te over the past several years. 
More recently, average hourly earnings of  production and nonsupervisory workers on 
private nonfarm
 payrolls rose 0.4 percent in  November, thereby bringing the year-over-
year change to 3¾ percent—about the same as  its increase over the previous 12 months. 
According to the ECI, employer contributions for health insurance rose about 4 percent 
over the 12 months ending in September; this  rise followed back-to-back increases of 
slightly less than 5 percent over the preceding two years.  Taken together, the available 
indicators thus far provide no ev idence that any dramatic change  in the rate of increase of

12 The private surveys were released in September an d thus predate the sharp deterioration in economic 
conditions, which may be leading some firms to purchase less expensive health plans or to require 
employees to shoulder a greater  share of the premiums.   health insurance costs is in the offing.  Pr ivate surveys—which typically show somewhat 
larger increases than the ECI—suggest that ove rall premiums (that is, the shares paid by 
both employers and employees) will rise in the neighborhood of 5 percent to 6 percent in 
2009, similar to the survey results for 2008.12  Among the major plans for public 
employees, premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program are expected to 
increase 7 percent in 2009 after a rise of just 2 percent in 2008.  The premiums for the 
California Public Employees’ Retirement Syst em are expected to move up 5 percent in 
2009 after a 7 percen t increase in 2008.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  
 
 Overview 
Investor concerns about the prospects of a deep and prolonged recession intensified over 
the intermeeting period.  As a result, the exp ected trajectory of the federal funds rate 
dropped, and yields on Treasury se curities plummeted.  Broad equity price indexes fell, 
and risk spreads on corporate bonds ballooned.  Although interest rate s on most types of 
household loans were unchanged or m oved down over the intermeeting period, 
households appeared to face tighter credit s upply conditions amid further deterioration in 
credit quality.  The available information suggests that credit flows to businesses and 
households have slowed furthe r this quarter, likely a re flection of both the tighter 
financial conditions and reduced borrower demand that has accompanied the weakening 
of the economy.  There were a few signs of  improvement in some short-term funding 
markets, but conditions remained strained.  In particular, year-end pressures emerged in 
the commercial paper and some interbank term funding markets. 
Financial institutions remained under stress during the intermeeting period.  Heightened 
concerns about the possible insolvency of Citigroup and the potential systemic 
implications prompted the U.S. government to offer a rescue package.  The Federal 
Reserve and other authorities took broader steps as well to ad dress the weakening 
economic outlook and the persistent problems in financial markets.  These actions 
included a program to purchase $500 billion in  mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued 
by the housing-related government-sponsored en terprises (GSEs) and Ginnie Mae as well 
as $100 billion in debt issued by the GSEs; the actions also included the announcement of 
a facility to support i ssuance of certain asset-backed securities. 
Financial Institutions and Fi nancial Market Functioning  
On balance, investor concerns about the condi tion of financial institutions seemed to 
intensify over the intermeeting period, with  credit default swap (CDS) spreads for 
investment-grade financial sector firms ri sing to record highs.  After the Treasury 
Department’s announcement on November 12 th at funds from the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP) would not be used to pur chase troubled mortgage-related and other 
securities, investors pulled b ack from assets they previously thought might be supported 
by the program.  Spreads for CDS indexes of subprime MBS, commercial mortgage-
backed securities, and leverage d loans all increased substantially.  The deterioration in 
asset prices further increased concerns about the solvency of financial institutions with 
significant holdings of such securities.

 Investor anxiety intensified after Citigr oup’s announcement on November 19 that it 
would bring more than $17 billion of distre ssed assets onto its books from a structured 
investment vehicle, which led to increased speculation about its pos sible insolvency and 
an increase in commercial bank CDS spreads more broadly.  On November 23, after the 
Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) announced a joint rescue package for Citigroup, stock prices rose and CDS spreads for financial in stitutions narrowed some.   
On November 25, the Federal Reserve announced  that it would initiate a program to 
purchase MBS issued by the housing-related GSEs and Ginnie Mae and debt issued by 
the GSEs in an effort to reduce the cost and in crease the availability of mortgage credit.  
Agency debt spreads and option-adjust ed spreads on agency MBS fell on the 
announcement, but option-adjusted spreads have  been volatile since then amid reports 
that the Treasury is considering a plan to  finance mortgages at significantly lower-than-
market rates.  The Federal Reserve simulta neously announced the creation of the Term 
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) to support issuance of  securities backed 
by auto loans, student loans,  and government-guaranteed sm all business loans, but the 
terms of the TALF have not yet been finalized, and conditi ons in those markets have 
shown little improvement. 
Short-Term Funding Markets  
Conditions in money markets remained stra ined, although there were a few signs of 
modest improvement.  Spreads of London interbank offered rates (Libor) over 
comparable-maturity overnight index swap (O IS) rates remain extremely wide.  These 
spreads moved lower in early November, but some of this improvement was reversed 
when the maturity date on one-month deposits cr ossed into the new year .  Trading in term 
funding markets past one month reportedly rema ined thin.  With market participants 
anticipating a cut in the target  rate at the December meeti ng, federal funds began trading 
at record low rates in early December.  Throughout the intermeeting period, the effective 
federal funds rate was well below the target rate in response to the extraordinary level of reserve balances resultin g from the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs.  
Strains remained in repurchase agreemen t (repo) markets over the period.  Rates on 
Treasury general collateral (GC)  repos were near zero.  Fails to deliver in the Treasury 
market dropped sharply, in part because of a decline in transacti on volume as well as 
industry efforts to resolve out standing fails amid discussi ons of potentia l regulatory 
changes to address the issue.  Spreads on re po transactions backed by agency and MBS

 collateral over Treasury GC rates decline d, on net, but bid-ask spreads and haircuts 
continue to be very elevated.     
The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (C PFF), which purchases 90-day A1/P1-rated 
commercial paper (CP), began operation on Oc tober 27.  Spreads on 30-day asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP) continued to narrow after the CPFF came on line but 
subsequently reversed part of the declin e as that maturity extended over year-end.  
Spreads on A2/P2 paper, which is not elig ible for the CPFF, remained extremely 
elevated.  Reflecting heavy issuance into the CPFF, unsecured financial CP and ABCP outstanding bounced back from their respec tive October lows.  Meanwhile, unsecured 
nonfinancial CP outstanding has increased only modestly over the period.  
Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision 
The level of total Federal Reserve assets rose significantly over the intermeeting period 
as financial institutions continued to tap liqui dity facilities and purchases of commercial 
paper through the CPFF ramped up.  Deposito ry institutions made heavy use of the 
discount window, and credit outstanding from the Term Auction Facility (TAF) increased about $150 billion, to about $450 billion.  Howe ver, the TAF auctions held during the 
intermeeting period—including two 84-day auc tions and two forward auctions covering 
year-end—were all undersubscribed.  Balances at the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and 
the ABCP Money Market Mutual Fund Liqui dity Facility (AMLF) both declined 
substantially, but the CPFF purchased more than $300 billion of securities.  Draws by 
foreign central banks under swap arrange ments increased about $90 billion over the 
intermeeting period. 
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve also announced on November 10 a modification of 
the special lending facility for American Inte rnational Group, Inc. (AIG).  Under the new 
arrangement, the Treasury will purchase $40 billion of preferred shares in AIG using 
TARP funds, and the rates on outstanding lo ans from the Federal Reserve will be 
reduced.  In addition, the Federal Reserv e Bank of New York will create two limited 
liability corporations (LLCs), one to purchase residential MB S from AIG and the other to 
purchase collateralized debt obligations on which AIG Financial Products has written 
CDS contracts.  The assets of the LLCs w ill be funded by AIG and the Federal Reserve, 
with AIG purchasing subordinated debt of the LLCs and the Federal Reserve providing 
senior loans to these LLCs.

 The four Term Securities Le nding Facility (TSLF) aucti ons held over the period had 
relatively tepid receptions, which reportedl y reflected the large amount of liquidity 
currently in the financial system and furthe r dealer liquidation of difficult-to-finance 
assets.  Market participants exercised onl y $8 billion of options on $50 billion of TSLF 
loans against schedule 2 collateral on  their November 28 exercise date. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The decision by the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) on October 29 to lower 
the target for the federal funds rate 50 ba sis points and the language in the accompanying 
statement were broadly in line with market e xpectations.  Since then, the expected path 
for policy has shifted down substantially on worse-than-anticipated economic data and 
concerns about the weaker economic outlook.  Surveys of primary dealers indicate that 
they place significant odds on a 50 basis point cu t in the federal funds rate target at the 
December FOMC meeting and that they expect  that target to remain flat over 2009.  
Quotes on federal funds futures suggest that market participants expect the effective 
federal funds rate to trade at about 25 basis points after the December meeting.  Looking 
further ahead, futures quotes suggest that the FOMC is expected to begin gradually raising the target federal funds rate next spring.  Under our standard assumptions about 
term premiums, the market appears to be pricing in a rise in the effective rate to about ¾ percent by the end of 2009 and to about 1¾ percent by the end of 2010.  That said, heightened uncertainty about the magnitude of  term premiums and the persistent softness 
in the federal funds rate relati ve to the target make it diffi cult to estimate the market’s 
expected policy path with any precision. 
Two-year nominal Treasury yields fell abou t 90 basis points over the intermeeting period, 
while 5- and 10-year yields dropped about  110 and 125 basis points, respectively, in 
response to the downward shift in the expected policy path, the de terioration in the 
economic outlook, and a strong flight to safe and liquid assets.  In flation compensation 
based on TIPS (Treasury inflation-protected securities) for the next 5 years declined 
sharply over the period, as did inflation co mpensation 5 to 10 years ahead.  Although 
these declines appear to have reflected so fter energy prices and lower-than-expected 
inflation readings, they likely have been exacerbated by especially poor liquidity in the 
TIPS and nominal Treasury markets.  Infla tion compensation measured by inflation 
swaps changed little over the period.

 Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity-price indexes declined about 5 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
on continuing concerns about the likelihood of  a deep and prolonged recession.  Financial 
stocks led the declines, dropping about 15 pe rcent.  The spread between the 12-month 
forward trend-earnings-price rati o for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real long-run 
Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity premium—widened markedly in November 
but narrowed somewhat in early December.  The option-implied volatility on the S&P 
500 index remained extremely elevated.   
Yields and spreads on speculative- and inve stment-grade corporate bonds soared to 
multidecade highs over the intermeeting period.  Also, loan price data from the Survey of 
Terms of Business Lending in November indicated that commercial and industrial (C&I) loan rate spreads increased moderately from the August survey after having been 
relatively flat over the previous  year.  Liquidity in the s econdary market for corporate 
bonds remained subpar, particularly for the speculative-grade segment. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms in the third quarter came in about         
20 percent below their year-earlier levels.  Profit declines were concentrated in the 
financial sector; earnings per share for nonfin ancial firms rose about 10 percent, with 
firms in the oil and gas industry accounting for virtually all of the increase.  In mid-
November, an index of analysts’ revisions  to year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms 
logged its most negative level on record, re flecting substantial markdowns of profit 
forecasts for both financial and nonfinancial firms.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms deteriorated somewhat in recent months.  In the 
third quarter, the aggregate le verage ratio of nonfinancial fi rms climbed further, and the 
aggregate liquid-asset ratio continued to trend down.  The volume of nonfinancial 
corporate bonds downgraded by Mo ody’s in the third quarter ro se to a moderate level, 
while the volume of upgraded bonds was sm all.  The share of corporate bonds 
outstanding rated “deep junk”—that is, bonds rated B3 or below—increased to about 
6½ percent.  The C&I loan deli nquency rate remained at a lo w level in the third quarter, 
and the realized six-month trailing bond defau lt rate was little changed in October after 
having shot up in September on the defau lts of two large financial companies.

 Business Finance 
In the nonfinancial corporate sector, gro ss investment-grade bond issuance remained 
solid in November, but there was again no speculative-grade issuance.  Issuance of 
syndicated loans also continued to be very  weak.  Nonfinancial commercial paper 
outstanding inched up further in November afte r posting a modest rise in October, while 
C&I loans declined somewhat in November af ter outsized increases in the previous two 
months that were mostly attributable to draw s on existing credit lines.  Overall, net debt 
financing by nonfinancial businesses slowed appreciably in November, which reflected 
tighter credit conditions—especially for lo wer-rated credits—and probably also lower 
demand for credit as companies pared spending plans. 
In October and November, both seasoned and initial equity offerings by nonfinancial 
corporations outside the ener gy sector remained weak.  In the third quarter, equity 
retirements by nonfinancial firms continued to outpace the combined amount of private 
and public issuance, as equ ity retirements from cash-financed mergers picked up 
somewhat with the completion of a few large deals.  However, share repurchases are 
estimated to have moderated a bit in recent months, and announcements of future cash-financed mergers have slowed significan tly, likely owing to the weaker economic 
outlook. 
For financial firms, public equity issuance e dged down in November.  In contrast, gross 
bond issuance by financial corporations surged  in late November and early December, 
with nearly all issuance at  maturities less than three years, as some large banking 
organizations made use of the FDIC’s te mporary liquidity guarantee program.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Conditions in commercial real estate markets have deteriorated considerably in recent 
months.  Commercial real estate debt contracted  at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third 
quarter, held down by declines in property prices, sluggish sales of commercial real 
estate, and tight credit conditions.  Amid rising vacancies and soft rent growth, the third-
quarter reading of the price index for recently sold commercial properties fell to a level 
10 percent below its peak in 2007.  In October,  sales dropped to their lowest level since 
2003.  The delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held by banks rose to nearly 5 percent in the third quarter, which mainly  reflected a further deterioration in the 
performance of residential and commercial c onstruction loans.  Th e delinquency rate on 
commercial mortgages held in commercial mortgage-backed securities moved up in 
October but remained well below its peak in 2003.

   Note: Auto includes car loans, leases, and financing for buyers of
motorcycles, trucks, and other vehicles.  ABS are asset-backed securities.   *Through Nov. 21.   Source: Inside Mortgage Finance; Merrill Lynch.The market for consumer loan asset-backed 
securities (ABS) has come under severe 
strain, with a sharp jump in spreads this fall and virtually no new issuance since September. 
In recent years, abou t one-half of credit 
card debt has been funded through the ABS 
market.  The strains of late in this market have increased issuer s’ funding costs, 
which, along with deteriorating household credit quality, have led lenders to tighten terms and standards.  Although the aggregate interest ra te on variable-rate 
credit cards has generally fallen with the prime rate over the past year, several large issuers have recently announced rate increases, particularly  for higher-credit-risk 
customers.  In addition, loan officers are increasingly reporting that they have reduced credit limits and are tightening standards for approving new credit applications. 
In the auto loan market, finance companies, 
which currently account for almost one-half of the outstanding loans, have used ABS to 
fund about one-third of their loans.  Now 
unable to securitize, finance companies appear to be funding new loans by stepping 
up loan sales to banks and tapping existing 
bank credit lines.  Finance companies also appear to be raising interest rates and lending more selectively—indeed, in mid-October, GMAC Financial Services announced new 
restrictions on lending to higher-risk 
customers.  Loan originations by the finance companies associated with the Detroit Three automakers declined sharply in October, 
although this pullback mirrored the drop-off 
in sales and likely reflects reduced demand as well as credit constraints.  While some prospective vehicle buyers may be able to 
obtain financing instead from depository 
institutions, the majority of loan officers at commercial banks have reported a tightening of terms and standards on consumer loans. 
Reports of a tighter supply of vehicle loans 
may also be discouraging households from even seeking financing.  The share of respondents to the Reuters/University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers who 
reported that it was a bad time to buy a car because credit is hard to get has recently climbed to a level well beyond that seen 
during the credit crunch in the early 1980s.

 Household Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, in terest rates on 30-year fixe d-rate conforming mortgages 
fell about ¾ percentage point, with most of the decline following the November 25 
announcement of the Federal Reserve’s progr am to purchase MBS issued by the housing 
GSEs and Ginnie Mae.  Even so, the spread of the conforming mo rtgage rate over the 
10-year Treasury yield rose well above the elevated level posted just before Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorship in early September. 
In secondary mortgage markets, issuance of  MBS by the housing GSEs slipped further in 
October, in part because of reduced pr imary borrowing amid lower house prices.  
Issuance by Ginnie Mae continued to be very strong in October, but  the non-agency MBS 
market remained closed.  Total mortgage debt decreased in the sec ond and third quarters, 
the first declines in the history of the series, which extends back to the 1950s. 
The national house price index released by the Federal H ousing Finance Agency fell 
about 6 percent in the third quarter, while the S&P/Case-S hiller and LoanPerformance 
national indexes decreased more than twice as much.  Falling home prices and the 
slowing economy have conti nued to weigh on mortgage cr edit quality.  In September, 
2 percent of prime mortgages,  11 percent of alt-A mortgages, and 24 percent of subprime 
mortgages were 90 or more days  past due or in foreclosure.   These rates are well above 
their levels at the start of the year, and the increases have shown no sign of abating. The credit quality of consumer loans has also continued to deterior ate, albeit less starkly 
than for mortgages.  The delinquency rate s on credit cards in securitized pools, on 
nonrevolving loans at commercial banks, and on auto loans at captive finance companies 
have all risen significantly, on ne t, over the course of this year.  At this point, though, 
none of these delinquency rates has yet re ached the level of the last recession.  
Interest rates on consumer loans fell over the intermeeting period but by less than 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields, leaving spreads a bit wider.  Annualized growth in revolving credit over the three months ending in October was just 1¾ percent, while 
nonrevolving credit contracted moderately.  Some part of the drop-off is likely related to weaker demand for loans, but the available evidence also suggests that lenders are 
restricting supply and that conditions may ti ghten yet further in response to the recent 
strains in market for asset-backed securiti es (ABS) (see box “Problems in the Market for 
Asset-Backed Securities and the Availability of Auto and Credit Card Loans”).  The recently announced Term Asset-Backed Securi ties Loan Facility, which is designed to

year.  
Amid further drops in asset pr ices, investors, on net, with drew substantial amounts from 
long-term mutual funds in October and N ovember.  Redemptions were widespread 
among fund types.  Money market funds saw la rge net inflows in October and November, 
and heavy inflows have continued into early December.  Inflows to prime funds picked 
up in early November after se veral weeks in which government  funds had attracted most 
of the new cash.     
Treasury Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury c onducted several aucti ons of nominal coupon 
securities but held no auctions of inflation-indexed securities .  Issuance of Treasury bills 
totaled about $800 billion, incl uding about $250 billion of cash management bills.  
However, the decline in the outstanding quantity of bills under the Supplementary 
Financing Program led to a drop in Treasury deposits placed at the Federal Reserve.  
Market demand for bills remained extremel y strong, and the auctions of longer-term 
nominal securities were generally well receiv ed, with low stop-out rates and high bid-to-
cover ratios.  The reopening of the 30-year bond, however, attracted onl y tepid interest.  
Foreign participation in Treasury aucti ons was at or above normal levels. 
Treasury market functioning continued to be poor over the intermeeting period.  Spreads 
between on- and off-the-run securities increa sed to record levels, and bid-asked spreads 
remained wide.  Volume in the Treasury cash market decreased notably amid ongoing 
dislocations in financing mark ets and reports that market pa rticipants are hoarding safe 
securities ahead of year-end.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Conditions in the municipal bond market de teriorated, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, despite some improvements in early November.  Long-term issuance continued to 
rebound in November, mostly for education and transportation projects.  Meanwhile, 
short-term issuance slowed in November, a de velopment consistent with typical seasonal 
patterns. 
The credit quality of municipal bonds deterior ated further over the intermeeting period 
amid a worsening outlook for the fiscal posi tions of state and local governments.  The 
number of municipal bonds downgr aded in the third quarter wa s substantial by historical

1 The share of loans made under commitment in the November STBL increased slightly to a new high 
of 91 percent, in line with other reports of heavy draws from credit lines. standards and far outpaced the number of upgr ades.  Yields on long-term municipal 
bonds rose over the intermeeting period, and ra tios of municipal-bond yields to those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities soared to record highs. 
Money and Bank Credit 
In November, the growth of M2 slowed ma rkedly from the rapid October pace to an 
annual rate of about 8 percent.  The deceleration last month was widespread across most 
components of M2, with the notable exception of liquid deposits.  Growth of small time 
deposits stepped down a bit to a still-striking pace of more  than 30 percent (annual rate) 
as banks continued to bid aggressively for these deposits to buttress their funding.  Liquid deposits expanded moderately in November .  Within the liquid deposits component, 
flows into demand deposits, which are covere d by the FDIC’s new Temporary Liquidity 
Guarantee Program, were extremely strong, with an annualized growth rate of more than 
150 percent.  These funds came in part from shifts out of savings accounts and reportedly 
also partly reflected investor s’ reallocation of funds from money market instruments.  
Currency growth also remained strong, with data suggesting continued strong demand for 
U.S. banknotes from abroad.   The rapid expansion of the monetary base in recent months reflects the provision of balances through the Federal Reserve’s liquidity programs. 
The surge in bank credit in October gave way to broad weakness in November.  C&I 
loans outstanding fell slightly in November after having expanded at an annual rate of 
50 percent in October, largely because of the financial market turmoil, which led some 
nonfinancial companies to draw  heavily on their bank lines.
1  Consumer loans originated 
by banks also declined in November after s howing surprising strength in October.  A 
significant step-down in November in the gr owth of home equity  lines of credit 
contributed to weakness in real  estate lending.  The volatile series “other loans,” which 
includes unplanned overdrafts, loans to nonbank fi nancial institutions, and security loans, 
continued to reverse the run-up over the previous intermeeti ng period.  The large swings 
in securities holdings in recent months were  driven mostly by a substantial purchase of 
Treasury securities in October by one institution taking advantage of easier access to funding at its commercial bank than at its br oker-dealer subsidiary and to another large 
bank steadily reducing its participation in the AMLF since mid-October. 
The third-quarter Call Reports for commercia l banks showed a further drop in unused 
commitments to extend loans, consistent with  reports of widespread tightening of credit 
III-24 
 standards.  The banking industry’s return on a ssets fell to 0.26 percen t, its lowest level 
since the fourth quarter of 1990.  Profits were  eroded by realized losses on available-for-
sale securities and higher loan-loss provisi ons.  The overall delinquency rate rose to 
3½ percent, with an increase in almost all loan categories, an d the ratio of charge-offs to 
assets increased to nearly 1 percent.  In addition, the fair value of non-agency mortgage-
backed securities declined significantly furt her to 85 percent of book value in the third 
quarter.  Dividends exceeded net income for the second consecutive quarter.

 U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services  
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $56.5 billion in September, as a large 
decline in imports more than offset a sizable  fall in exports. 
In S
eptember, the value of exports of goods and services declined 6 percent; declines 
were widespread but largely concentrated in  industrial supplies and capital goods.  The 
fall in exports of industrial supplies primarily reflected a decrease in the value of exports of fuels  and chemicals due to both lower prices and transp ortation disruptions caused by 
Hurricanes Gustav and Ike .  The fall in exports of capital goods primarily reflected a 
decline in exports of aircraft and parts due to a strike at Boeing.  Exports of automotive products, consumer goods, and services also moved down. 
Although exports declined in both August and September, rapid increases in previous 
m
onths boosted the average value of exports in the third quarter by 12.3 percent at an 
annual rate .  The increas e was supported by strong exports of industrial supplies, 
although other major categories of exports also exhibited large gains.

 The value of imports of goods and services fell 5.6 percent in September, with imports of 
oil and consumer goods recording particula rly large declines.  The decline in oil imports 
reflected both a decrease in the volume of oil imports, partly on account of hurricane-related shipping disruptions, and a decrease in prices.  The decline in consumer goods 
partly reflected  a large fall in imports of pharmaceuticals, which tend to be volatile.  
Imports of non- oil industrial supplies and autom otive products also moved down.  
Imports of services fell back after being boosted in August by royalty payments associated  with the 20 08 Summer Olympics.  In contrast, imports of capital goods 
recorded a small increase following a decrease in August.       
Despite declines in August and September, the average value of imports in the third quarter increased 6.4 percent at an annual rate.   The increase largely reflected increased 
imports of oil, on account of higher prices (early in the quarter) as vo lumes declined.  
Industrial supplies, consumer goods, and servic es also recorded sizable gains.  In 
contrast, imports of capital goods, parti cularly aircraft and computers, as well as 
automotive products exhibited declines.    
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In October , prices of core imports fell 0.9  percent , the largest one-
month decline over the 14 -year history of the index.  Thi s decline, combined with the 
0.5 percent decline in September , reversed  much of the increases reported in the previous 
three months.  The October decline reflected a 2.8 percent drop in the prices for material-
intensi ve goods, which was due to both falling food prices and, more importa nt, falling 
metals prices.  In contrast, prices for finished goods were li ttle changed , as slightly higher 
prices for consumer goods and automotive product s were offset by falling prices for 
capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors. 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) price index of imported oil fell nearly 
17 percent in October, marking the third consecutive monthly decline.  The index has 
fallen more than 32 percent since July, the largest three -month decline since early 1991.  
The spot price of West Texas I ntermediate crude oil (WTI) also declined in October, 
falling 26 percent to an average of $77 per barrel for the month as a whole.  Since that time, the spot price of WTI has continued to decline , closing most recently on December 
9 at $ 42.07 per barrel.  The continued decline in oil prices reflects the worsening 
prospects for global economic activity and global oil demand.

Exports.  Following a 0.9  percent decli ne in September, price s of exported core goods 
fell 2.2 percent in October .  The sha rp decline in October largely reflected  an 8.7 percent 
fall in prices of agricultural goods.  Prices of non- agricultural industrial supplies fell 
3.8 percent in Octo ber, fo llowing a 2.7 percent drop in September.  In contrast to prices 
for material-intensive goods, prices for finished goods rose 0.4 percent  in October, a step-
up from the 0.1 percent increase recorded in September .  All major categories within 
finished goods saw comparable increases.  According to the BLS, the 0.4 percent price 
increase for automotive products is partially attributable to year -end model changeovers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the October Greenbook, we have received data on U.S. international financial 
transactions for September and October, along with partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) through November.  During these months of intensified turmoil, exchange market intervention affected foreign official flows, the reciprocal currency swaps, (which enhanced dollar liquidity abroad) led to increased private banking inflows, and the strong preference of foreigners for Treasury securities over other U.S. securities became still more apparent.  
  
 Foreign official flows changed from robust net purchases of U.S. securities in September 
to unusual net sales in October (line 1 of the “Summary of U.S. International Transactions” table and the chart “Forei gn Official Financial Inflows through October 
2008”) as several countries intervened in foreign exchange markets.   
 
.   
.  China’s 
acquisitions of Treasury securities jumped in September but then fell back in October and November to more typical rates, thereby contributing to the October swing to official net sales.   
Stepped-up drawings on the reciprocal swap facilities (included in line 2) generated significant official outflows in September and October as the Federal Reserve acquired deposit claims on partner central banks.  The corresponding, or “offsetting,” inflows could appear anywhere in the financial accounts, but, given the nature of the funding pressures abroad, we would anticipate a sizable reduction in U.S. net lending to foreign banks to generate some of these inflows.  Indeed, from August 2007 to August 2008, banking positions with foreigners (line 3) had been posting consistent outflows averaging about $45 billion per month, but these changed to inflows of $6 billion in September and an unprecedented $204 billion in October.  This shift in funding flow was more than accounted for by reduced U.S. bank lending to foreign banks (as distinct from other foreign entities) of $132 billion in September and $266 billion in October.  
Foreig n private purchases of U.S. securities totaled $42 billion in September and 
$48 billion in October (line 4), exceeding their pace from earlier in the year.  However, the composition of these inflows was even more heavily weighted toward Treasury 
securities than was the case earlier.  In particular, private foreigners, on net, purchased a 
staggering $104 billion in Treasury securities in October (line 4a), more than double the 

IV-9 
 
 previous high of April 2008.  In contrast, private foreigners continued to sell corporate 
bonds in September and October (line 4c).  Private foreign transactions in agency bonds returned to net sales in October after a brief renewal of net purchases in September, the month that conservatorship was announced for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (line 4b).  Finally, foreign net purchases of equity were relatively strong in September, following weakness earlier in the quarter, but returned to net sales in October (line 4d).  
After many years of quarterly net purchases, U.S. residents, on net, sold $85 billion in foreign long- term securities in the third quarter of 2008 (line 5).  The pace of net sales 
then increased in October to $34 billion for the month.  In addition, U.S. residents reduced investments in foreign short-term securities by $35 billion and in foreign deposits by $62 billion during the third quarter.  (These data, not shown, will be included in line 10 upon the release of the third- quarter balance of payments accounts.)  
Reductions in these financial sector investments are consisten t not only with a reduced 
desire for foreign exposure but also with the easing effect of the currency swaps on foreign banks’ dollar funding needs.  Overall, the third-quarter reduction in all types of U.S. investments abroad totaled more than $180 billion, generating a significant portion of the quarter’s net inflows.

     Foreign Financial Markets 
Clear evidence of a slowdown in activity and the rapid waning of inflationary pressures 
prompted central banks in advanced foreign economies to lower their policy interest rates, and long-term sovereign bond yields in these economies dropped sharply.  Net movements in equity prices and exchange rates were more moderate, although the volatility of these asset prices continued to be high amid further uncertainty about the severity and the duration of the ongoing global recession 
C
onditions in interbank funding markets have improved on net since the October 
Greenbook, with one-month Libor-OIS spreads in euro, sterling, and dollars narrowing, 
particularly in dol lars.  The basis spread implied by foreign exchange swaps between the 
dollar and the euro rose slightly in November, consistent with continued dollar funding pressure for some institutions, but the spread has declined sharply in the past few days as 
funding  pressure seems to have abated since early December.  There were relatively few new initiatives by governments in the major foreign economies aimed at stabilizing funding markets, but a number of European governments did clarify the debt guarantee programs they had initiated in October, and a few banks began to issue debt backed by those programs.  
Ten-year nominal sovereign bond yields, which changed relatively little in the previous 
period, dropped about 90 basis points in the United Kingdom, and 50 to 60 basis points in 
Germany and Canada.  Corporate spreads (both investment- grade and lower -rated) 
changed little in the euro area, but they rose in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan.  Equity indexes, which suffered very large drops in September, remai ned highly volatile 
but registered more moderate net movements in October .  The FTSE 100 rose 8  percent, 
and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx changed little on net.  Japan’s TOPIX index dropped 6 percent, about as much as the S&P 500.  Banking sector share prices fell sharply in the euro area and in the United States.    
The major currencies index of the dollar has changed little on net since the time of the October Greenbook, but some bilateral exchange rate movements have been more substantial.  The dollar depre ciated 1 percent on net versus the euro and 6 percent against 
the Japanese yen, which seemed to be boosted by a continued reduction in carry trades.  But the dollar appreciated 9 percent versus sterling.  Implied volatilities in most currency pairs remaine d elevated, although well below the multiyear highs reached in the previous 
intermeeting period.  
IV-14 
 
 On October 29, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of temporary reciprocal 
currency agreements (swap lines) with the central banks of Brazil, Mexico, and Korea, and with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  These facilities, designed to address dollar funding pressure in these economies, can support the provision of dollar liquidity in amounts of up to $30 billion to each of the central banks.  Financial markets in the four countries reacted positively to the announcements, including, in most cases, a narrowing of their sovereign spreads and an appreciation of their domestic currencies.  By the end of the intermeeting period, only the Bank of Korea had drawn on its swap line and auctioned dollar funding to its banks.  The Bank of Korea auctioned $4 billion of 84-day funds on December 2 at a weighted -average interest rate of 6.84 percent, and $3 billion of 84-day 
funds on December 9 at a weighted- average interest rate of 5.58 percent; the interest rates 
in both auctions were well above 3-month dollar Libor.   
Exchange rate movements against emerging market currencies were much more moderate than in the previous period.  In aggregate, the dollar ha s changed little against the 
currencies of our other important trading partner since the October Greenbook.  The dollar appreciated 5 percent versus the Brazilian 
real, was little changed on net against 
the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi, and depreciated 3 percent versus the Korean won.  There continued to be reports of foreign exchange intervention by a number of emerging market countries in support of their domestic currencies.  Following a few days when Chinese authorities let the renminbi depreciate a bit more than had previously been allowed, some concerns arose that the Chinese government was considering guiding the renminbi to depreciate against the dollar to help boost exports.  By the end of the period, nondeliverable forward renminbi exchange rates were pricing in a 4 percent depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the next 12 months.   
E
quity indexes were mixed in Latin American and Asian markets over the period.  The 
Chinese government’s announcement of a large fiscal stimulus package may have helped support Chinese equity prices, which rose 10 percent on net.  Equity markets in the emerging market economies were likely supported as well by further steps by a number of governments to help stabilize funding markets and to increase spending.  Sovereign yield spreads in Latin America and emerging Asia declined from their peaks of mid-October, but remained quite elevated.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Economic activity in most advanced foreign economies contracted in the third quarter, 
driven by sharp declines in investment and significant negative contributions of net exports, as the recession took hold more strongly.  Real GDP in Canada increased at a faster -than-expected pace, although consumption and investment continued to soften. 
Incoming data point to an even weaker pace of activity in the fourth quarter.  Confidence indicators plunged and have now reached levels not observed since the early 1990s.  In November, the euro- area and U.K. purchasing managers indexes (PMI) fell to levels 
associated with severe contractions in economic activity.  Labor market conditions deteriorated further, with rising unemployment rates in most countries.  
After peaking during the third quarter, consumer price inflation has moderated in all advanced foreign economies, primarily as a result of falling energy and food prices.  Faced with clear evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and rapid waning of inflationary pressures, all major central banks lowered policy rates in the intermeeting period.  The Bank of England slashed its base rate a total of 250 basis points and the European Central Bank by 125 basis points.  The Bank of Canada lowered its overnight target rate by 75 basis points.  The Bank of Japan lowered its target for the overnight call rate by 20 basis points, to 30 basis points.   
Since the last Greenbook, a number of countries have announced fiscal stimulus packages 
to cope with the slowdown in economic activity.  However, given the nature of the measures announced – mostly tax exemptions for private investment and increased 
spending for public infrastructure – fiscal policy will likely have limited impact in the current and upcoming quarters. 
IV-21 
 
IV-22 
 
 
 In Japan , GDP fell 1.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter after falling a downwardly 
revised 3.7 percent in the second quarter.  Domestic demand declined, as a modest 
rebound in private consumption was offset by a sharp drop in private investment.  Private investment has fallen in five out of the past six quarters.  N et exports subtracted 
0.5 percentage point from GDP growth, with a bounceback in imports outpac ing that of 
exports.  
More re
cently, exports fell 3.2 percent in October following declines in August and 
Septem ber.  Household spending has been anemic, and housing starts fell almost 
9 percent in October from the previous month, continuing a long decline.  Industrial production plummeted in October and is currently 7 percent below its October 2007 peak.  The job openings- to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings 
relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) in October hit its lowest level 
since May 2004. 
IV-23 
 
IV-24 
 
 
 
 
 Japanese twelve -month consumer price inflation was 1.7 percent in October, down 
sharply from 2.1 percent in September, reflecting a decline in food and energy prices.  
Excluding food and energy prices, c onsumer prices rose 0.2 percent from the previous 
year.   
On October 31, the Bank of Japan lowered its policy rate 20 basis points to 0.3 percent.  Market participants seem to expect further easing by the Bank of Japan in 2009, although Gove rnor Shirakawa has repeatedly expressed concerns about the negative impact of a 
policy rate near zero on the functioning of money markets. 
The Japanese government announced an ¥26.9 trillion fiscal stimulus on October 30 
(5.2 percent of GDP).  The majority of the package is allocated to credit guarantees for small and medium- sized enterprises.  The remaining measures include modest taxpayer 
rebates, increased tax breaks on mortgages, and a decrease in highway tolls.  Actual government expenditure is expected to increase by ¥5 trillion (1.0 percent of GDP).  
IV-25 
 
 
  
 In the euro area , real GDP contracted 0.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, with GDP 
for Germany and Italy falling about 2 percent.  Domestic demand rebounded somewhat 
from the poor second- quarter performance; additional declines in investment were offset 
by increases in total consumption and inventories.  A surge in imports provided sizable negative contribution of net exports to headline growth. 
Recent indicators suggest considerable weakness in the current quarter.  In October, the volume of retail sales fell 0.8 percent, with marked declines in Germany a nd Spain, and 
the unemployment rate increased to 7.7 percent.  November PMI figures for manufacturing and services dropped sharply to the lowest level since the early 1990s.  Consumer and industrial confidence indicators continued to plunge in November.   
Twelve -month consumer price inflation in the euro area in November fell to 2.1 percent, 
according to the flash estimate, down from 3.2 percent in October and a peak of 4 percent in July.  Although components are not yet available, the marked moderation in November appears to reflect the recent fall in oil and other energy prices.   
The European Central Bank cut its policy rate 50 basis points in early November and an 
additional 75  basis points on December 4.   The po licy rate now stands at 2.5 percent .  
The central bank stated that the downside risks to growth have increased in response to 
the recent financial developments and inflation ary pressures have diminished further.   
In the last month, the European Commission has officially stated that it will allow national governments to temporarily breach the 3 percent budget deficit limit imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact, in application of the “exceptional circumstances” clause.  Several governments—including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain—have announced fiscal stimulus packages.  However, the measures adopted so far only include modest corporate tax credits for new investments or increases in expenditures for public infrastructure.

 Real GDP in the United Kingdom  shrank 2.0 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter.  
Domestic demand plummeted, decreasing for the third consecutive quarter, and net 
exports made a negative contribution.   
Incoming data point to further weakness in the fourth quarter.  Unemployment claims 
continued to ris e in October, and retail sales posted a small decline.  In November, 
business confidence plummeted to a level not seen since the trough of the early 1980s recession, and consumer confidence was at its lowest level since 1992.  The November readings of the PMIs are consistent with a severe contraction in the manufacturing, services, and construction sectors.  The housing sector is still  under significant stress; 
housing price s have fallen 15 percent since their peak , and mortgage lending remains 
constrained. 
O
n November 24, the U.K. government unveiled a £20 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) fiscal 
stimulus package effective over the current and next fiscal year.  T he value- added tax 
(VAT) rate was temporarily lowered from 17.5 percent  to 15 percent  until Decembe r 31, 
2009.  The measure is expected to cost £12.5 billion in lost revenues.  In addition, t he 
government permanently increased  tax exemptions for individuals and brought forward  
almost £3 billion of spending in public infrastructure  to 2009. 
IV-28 
 
 Twelve -month  consumer price inflation in October moderated from 5.2 percent to 
4.5 percent as a result of falling commodity and energy prices.  The Office for National 
Statistics estimates that the reduction in the VAT will shave an additional 1.3 percentage points fr om inflation in December.   
On December 4, the Bank of England cut its main policy rate 100 basis points to 2.0 percent, citing additional deterioration in economic activity and considerable stress in credit markets as important factors contributing to th e monetary policy decision.  
The rate cut followed a 150 basis-point reduction in the policy rate in November.

IV-30 
 
 
 
  In Canada, real GDP rose an unexpectedly rapid 1.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, 
following a 0.6 percent increase in the second quarter.  Both consumption and investment provided softening, yet positive, contributions to growth.  Net exports provided no contribution to growth with a marked decline in imports balancing a reduction in exports.  
Third -quarter stren gth does not appear have continued into the fourth quarter.  
In November, employment declined 0.4 percentage point, posting the largest monthly 
loss since 1982.  The unemployment rate increased to 6.3 percent, and housing starts fell 
almost 19 percent from the previous month.  The PMI dropped sharply into the contraction region after a weak October reading.   
T
welve -month consumer price inflation slowed to 2.8 percent in October and 
core inflation remained at 1.7 percent.  The reduction in consumer price i nflation reflects 
primarily the recent fall in food and energy prices.  On December 9, the Bank of Canada lowered the overnight rate target 75 basis points to 1.5 percent, stating that the country is entering a recession.

IV-32 
 
 
 Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Economic activity in most emerging market economies decelerated sharply in the third 
quarter.  In Mexico and India, however, a surge in agricultural output helped to support 
growth.  Recent data on industrial production, retail sales, PMIs, and business and consumer confidence suggest that growth has likely remained depressed in the current quarter as well.  Headline inflation generally declined across emerging market economies, due primarily to lower food and energy prices and, in some cases, to weaker economic activity, but Brazil and Mexico are notable exceptions.  With inflation moderating and growth slowing significantly, authorities in several countries loosened monetary policy and announced fiscal stimulus packages. 
In China , growth slowed to an estimated 5.4 percent (a.r.) in the third quarter, half the 
pace of the previous quarter.  Indications are that growth has likely continued to slow in 
the current quarter.  In October, industrial production contracted for the fourth straight 
month.  The trade surplus widened in October and November as exports fell less than 
imports.  However, exports in November were below year -ago levels for the first time 
since 2001.  Domestic demand has held up well , with retail sales in October up 
22 percent from a year earlier , roughly the pace recorded in September.  With the slowing 
of the economy and declines in commodity prices, twelve-month headline inflation dropped sharply to 4 percent in October. 
Over the past few months, Chinese authorities have shifted their focus from containing 
price pressures to supporting growth.  Since the time of the October Greenbook, the 
People’s Bank of China has lowe red the one -year benchmark bank lending rate by 
135 basis points and has also lowered deposit rates and reserve requirements.  In addition, the government announced a large fiscal stimulus package totaling 16 percent of 2007 GDP over the next two years.  Nearly half of the spending is slated for infrastructure investment, and the remainder is to be allocated to rural development, health care, education, and various projects to protect the environment and spur technological innovation.  It is unclear, however, how much new stimulus is included in the package, particularly given uncertainties over the funding and timing of the expenditures.  Moreover, the total value of the package includes projects that had been previously announced, including the reconstruction of areas affected by the Sichuan earthquake in May.

ndia’s  real GDP grew at a surprisingly strong 8¼ percent pace in the third quarter.  
Manufacturing production was weak and exports contracted, but activity in the 
agricultural, mining, and construction sectors rebounded sharply from their depressed second -quarter levels.  Little hard data are yet available for the fourth quarter, but 
anecdotal evidence suggests that exports fell sharply in October and that overall economic activity is slowing.  Although consumer price inflation moved up, the closely watched wholesale price inflation declined further, to 11 percent in the twelve months ended in October.  
The Reserve Bank of India cut its policy rate a to tal of 150 basis points, to 6½  percent , in 
two consecutive meetings in November and December.  In addition, the central bank took a number of measures aimed at increasing liquidity and access to credit, including a 350 basis point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, an increase in the ceiling on foreign borrowing for non-bank financial companies and mutual funds, and a repurchase of sterilization bonds.  In early December, the government announced a fiscal stimulus package valued at approximately 1 percent of GDP, which includes expenditures on public infrastructure, a reduction in the value added tax, and assistance to small and medium enterprises.  The government also announced a 10 percent reduction in retail fuel 
prices.

1 Newly  industrialized economies: Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. In the NIEs1, economic activity fell sharply in the third quarter as the slowdown in global 
activity weighed significantly on the region’s exports and the deterioration in financial 
conditions adversely affected sentiment and domestic demand.  Real GDP contracted in both Singapore and Hong Kong for the second consecutive quarter, plunged over 10 percent (a.r) in Taiwan, and expanded only 2 percent in South Korea.  Recent data suggest that activity has remained weak in the current quarter.   Industrial production for 
Singapore, Korea, and Taiwan fell in October.  Other indicators of activity, such as PMI surveys, retail sales, and consumer and business sentiment, also point to weak activity.  Incoming trade data for the current quarter generally show significant improvements in trade balances, including a swing to surpluses in Korea and Taiwan from deficits in previous months.  Exports generally contracted, but this was more than offset by declines in imports owing to lower commodity prices and weaker domestic demand. 
Inflation declined further across the NIEs as food and energy prices continued to retreat.  With inflation rates falling and economic growth slowing rapidly, central banks continued to ease monetary policy.  The monetary authorities of Taiwan and Hong Kong cut th eir policy rates by 50 basis points.  The Bank of Korea cut its policy rate by 75 basis 
points in late October and again by 25 basis points in early November.  In addition, governments are loosening fiscal policy.  South Korea is implementing a previously announced fiscal stimulus package estimated at 3¾ percent of GDP.  Taiwan announced the distribution in January of consumption vouchers worth nearly 1 percent of GDP, and Hong Kong is proceeding with implementing previously announced infrastructure spending.

2ASEAN -4 economies: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand.   
 In the  ASEAN-42 region, growth fell significantly in the third quarter owing primarily to 
a contraction in exports.  Early indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that activity 
remains weak.  In October, exports fell in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.  Indicators of business and consumer confidence as well as retail sales data have been weak.  Across the region, twelve-month headline inflation has continued to decline, reflecting the moderation in food and energy prices.  In response to slowing growth and moderating inflation, the Bank of Thailand cut its policy rate 100 basis points in early December.  In a surprise move, the central bank of Malaysia cut its policy rate 25 basis points, the first rate change since April 2006.  Bank Indonesia began to loosen policy, lowering its policy 
rate 25 basis points to 9¼ percent in early December.

n early November, the Malaysian government announced a $2 billion fiscal stimulus 
package to develop the country’s infrastructure.  In Thailand, a n already fragile political 
situation deteriorated further over the past few weeks when protests caused the country’s largest airport to shut down, stranding thousands of tourists.  Subsequently, Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat resigned after the Constitu tional Court banned him from 
politics for five years and dissolved the country’s top three ruling parties for electoral fraud.  A special election is expected to be held soon.

      In Mexico , third -quarter real GDP grew at a higher -than-expected  pace of 2½ percent, 
owing primarily to a surge in agricultural output.  Activity in other sectors generally remained weak; industrial production fell, and the trade deficit widened.  The impetus from the agricultural sector will likely wane, and recent in dicators of activity have 
deteriorated, suggesting that growth will fall in the current quarter.  In October, exports contracted on account of weak U.S. demand, and business and consumer confidence as well as the manufacturing PMI plunged.  Despite tepid domestic activity and the fall in global commodity prices, twelve-month headline and core inflation remain elevated, reflecting the pass-through of previous increases in food and energy prices as well as the effect of the sharp depreciation of the peso agai nst the U.S. dollar. 
Mexico has taken a number of steps to contain the effect of the financial turmoil.  The Bank of Mexico intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the depreciating peso.  The Mexican government unveiled a fiscal stimulus package estimated at 1 percent of GDP, and the lower house of Congress passed a bill that authorizes private investment in PEMEX , the state’s oil monopoly.  Mexico’s oil export revenues are partially shielded 
from the recent declines in crude oil prices because of put options that give the country the right to sell its oil production for at least $70 per barrel over the next year.

n Brazil , third -quarter real GDP grew at an annual rate of 7½ percent, up 1 percentage 
point from the pace in the first h alf of the year.  Growth was supported by strong 
domestic demand, with consumption and investment up 11½ percent and nearly 30 percent, respectively.  Indications are that activity has slowed significantly in the current quarter.  In October, industrial output fell nearly 2  percent.  The decline was 
broad-based and led by a sharp fall in production of consumer durables.  In addition, preliminary data indicate that auto production and sales, which fell sharply in October, continued to decline in November.  Signs of the weakening economy are also apparent in the external sector where exports have plummeted.  Headline inflation remained elevated; with consumer prices rose 6.4  percent for the twelve months ending in October.  Since 
the October Greenbook, the central bank has continued to relax reserve requirements in an attempt to improve access to credit for smaller banks and to the private sector, but it has kept its target policy rate on hold at 13¾ percent since September.

 In 
Argentina, indicators for the third quarter have generally been mixed, but on balance 
point to a moderation of activity.  Exports improved following a resolution of the conflict 
between farmers and the government over a proposal to tax exports , and industrial 
production was up, but other indicators such as retail sales suggest that domestic demand 
was lackluster.  In October, industrial production fell and exports contracted sharply. Confidence indicators deteriorated further, weighed down by rapid declines in commodity prices and the government’s decision to nationalize the private pension funds, 
which prompted large capital outflows.  In November, the government unveiled a fiscal 
stimulus plan , calling for expenditure of more than $21 billion  on public infrastructure  
beginning in mid-December .  In addition, the government announced tax breaks for 
Argentine ans who repatriate their funds and debt relief for small businesses and fi rms 
that encourage employment.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell to 8.4 percent in October due to weak domestic demand and declines in commodity prices; however, the reliability of the official inflation data remains questionable .

enezuelan real GDP growth slowed sharply in the third quarter to 2¾ percent as non-
petroleum output stagnated.  Twelve-month headline inflation remained elevated at over 
30 percent in November.  The Venezuelan government repurchased $800 million of its external debt.  As expected, Chavez supporters won the majority of governorship and local posts during the November el ections because the Chavez- controlled Supreme Court 
barred roughly 300 opposition candidates from running.  Since the election, Chavez has called for additional nationalizations and for another referendum to allow him to stay in power indefinitely.

 In Russia , third-quarter growth fell to 2¼ percent, down from 6 percent in the second 
quarter, due to the declines in oil and other commodity prices, and the effect of stresses in 
financial markets.  Since then, conditions appear to have deteriorated further.  In October, retail sales and industrial production declined, and business confidence sank.  Inflation remained high, at more than 14 percent over the twelve months ending in October.  Russia’s financial system has been under considerable stress, as the global crisis revealed the Russian corporate sector’s dependence on foreign borrowing.  The central bank raised interest rates 100 basis points to 13 percent in early December and intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the ruble.  Reflecting the interventions, the provision of dollar funding to Russian banks and corporations, and valuation effects of the euro-denominated portion of the reserves, international reserves fell to $450 billion at the end of November, down from a peak of $600 bill ion last summer .
