1 Emergency unemployment insurance benefits have likely boosted labor force participation and the 
unemployment rate in recent months by encouraging unemployed individuals to remain in the labor force.  
In December, we estimate that emergency benefits contri buted about 0.2 percentage point to the level of the 
published unemployment rate and about 0.1 percentage point to the level of the published labor force participation rate.  Nearly all major sectors of the economy registered significant declines in activity at the 
end of 2008.  Conditions in the labor market continued to deteriorate in December as 
payrolls shrank and the unemploym ent rate climbed further.  Available data suggest that 
consumer spending decreased markedly again in the fourth quarter, and declines in housing construction steepened.  Business spending on equipment and software fell 
sharply late in the year, w ith all major components cont racting.  Industrial production 
plunged in the fourth quarter, as output was re duced in the vast majo rity of industries.  
Despite the cutbacks in production, spendi ng by households and businesses fell even 
faster, and, as a result, inventory overhangs  emerged in a number of areas.  Consumer 
prices tumbled in the last three months of 2008, as consumer energy prices plummeted 
and both food and core consumer pr ice inflation slowed noticeably. 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor market conditions continued to deterior ate rapidly in December, as employment on 
private nonfarm payrolls fell more than ½ million for a second consecutive month.  Since 
the recession began in December 2007, priv ate employment has plummeted 2¾ million, 
or nearly 2½ percent; in per centage terms, this drop is th e largest 12-month decline since 
1982.  Employment losses were once again spre ad widely across industries in December, 
and the 3-month diffusion index of payroll changes fell to 24.1, the lowest reading since the series began in 1991.  In addition,  the average workweek of production and 
nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payr olls fell 0.2 hour in December.  For the 
fourth quarter as a whole, aggregate hours for this group of workers declined at an annual 
rate of 7.7 percent. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  increased in December to 7.2 percent, up 
from 6.8 percent in November and 4.9 per cent in December 2007.  The fraction of 
workers who were working part time for economic reasons—another measure of the 
utilization of labor—surged in December, after steep increases over the preceding two 
months.  Over the 12 months ending in December, the share of employed individuals working part time for economic reasons rose 2.4 percentage points, to  5.6 percent.  The 
labor force participation rate edged down to 65.7 percent in December, 0.3 percentage 
point below the level a year earlier.

Other indicators also point to an ongoing w eakening in the labor market.  Measures of 
involuntary separations—short-te rm job losers in the hous ehold survey, initial and 
continuing claims for unemployment insurance, and announcements of job cuts as 
reported by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.—have remained hi gh.  Indicators of 
vacancies and hiring—the job openings and hiring rates from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, the Help Wanted Index, and hiring plans from the National 
Federation of Independent Busi ness (NFIB) survey—have declin ed further.  Meanwhile, 
alternative gauges of labor market slack—job availability as reported in the Conference 
Board survey and hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey—continued to worsen.  Finally, according to both the Reuters/University of Michigan and the Conference Board surveys, household expectations of future la bor market conditions remained pessimistic. 
Industrial Production 
Producers have continued to aggressively pare back production in response to weakening 
domestic and foreign demand.  Industrial pr oduction (IP) fell 2.0 percent in December, 
and for the fourth quarter as a whole, IP dr opped at an annual rate of 11½ percent.  Even 
this dismal fourth-quarter figure understates the pace of decline in activity; excluding the 
bounceback in aircraft production after the end of  the machinists’ strike at Boeing and the 
rebound in output after the September hurricanes , total production is estimated to have 
fallen 14 percent last quarter.  In the past few months, the de clines in output have become 
increasingly widespread across industries; the diffusion inde x of three-month changes in 
IP remained near a 28-year low last mont h.  Furthermore, lower production pushed down 
December’s factory operating rate to 70.2 percent,  a rate that was 9.5 percentage points

below its 1972–2007 average and 1.3 percen tage points below its trough in the 2001 
downturn. 
Light vehicle assemblies fell to an annual rate of 6.4 million units in December and 
averaged only 7.2 million units in the fourth  quarter.  The pace of production has dropped 
in each of the past three months, as auto makers have struggled to align vehicle 
inventories with the low levels of demand; despite the production cuts, stocks of light 
vehicles increased in the f ourth quarter and days’ supply rose to almost 100 days, well 
above the industry norm.  As a result, automa kers recently slashed their already-modest 
assembly plans for the first quarter; the curr ently scheduled rate of  5.9 million units, if 
realized, will be the slowest pace of produc tion since the first quarter of 1982 and will 
push the industry operating rate to under 45 percent. 
The production of aircraft and parts bounced back in December after having been held 
down in the autumn by a strike and by disrupt ions related to a faulty component.  The 
backlog of orders for Boeing aircraft remains enormous, which should support 
commercial aircraft production for several years.  Nevertheless, Boeing recently 
announced job cuts of 4,500 nonproduction workers,  and press reports indicate that some 
customers are deferring deliveries.  As yet,  however, cancellations have not increased 
significantly. 
The output of high-technology goods posted a second consecutive dec line in the fourth 
quarter, and losses were wide spread across subcategories.   Semiconductor production fell 
at an annual rate of more than  40 percent, with a particularly  sizable drop in the output of 
microprocessors.  Production of communications equipment contracted 6½ percent, and 
the output of computers declined further;  information from International Data 
Corporation shows a general weakening in demand for both personal computers and 
servers. 
The available indicators point to  a further weakening in high-tech output in the near term.  
The months’ supply of computers, communicat ions equipment, and semiconductors has 
risen despite sizable cuts to production.  For semiconductors, Intel’s internal estimate for 
first-quarter revenue is cons istent with another decline in microprocessor production, and 
recent projections from consultancies, such  as Gartner and iSuppli, predict a marked 
decline in global chip sales in 2009.  Orders for circuit boards have continued to trend 
down, on net, and suggest a weakening in production within the broader electronics 
sector.  Data from the Semiconductor Equipmen t and Materials Intern ational association

2 GMAC Financial Services expanded its lending pr ograms on December 29, a move that followed the 
approval of its application to become a bank holding company.  GMAC resumed writing loans for some 
customers with FICO scores below 720, a practice it had suspended in October, and it participated in a 
zero-interest loan promotion at GM in the final days of December. show that bookings for the equipment used to fabricate semiconductors fell back in 
December, and orders remain we ll below year-earlier levels. 
Outside of energy, motor vehicles and part s, aircraft and parts, and high-technology 
industries, production plunged at an annual rate of 16¼ percent in the fourth quarter, with 
sharp declines in each of the major market groups.  The output of consumer goods 
decreased at a 5½ percent rate, with particular weakness in consumer durables, such as 
appliances, furniture, and carpeting.  Busine ss equipment production fell at a 16¼ percent 
rate in the fourth quarter, partly because of a sharp decline in farm, construction, and 
semiconductor fabricating machinery.  The indexes for construction supplies and for 
materials both dropped at about a 25 percent rate, while production of business supplies 
fell at a 14½ percent rate. 
The indicators of near-term manufacturing activity suggest that manufacturing output will 
continue to contract sharpl y over the next few months.  For January, motor vehicle 
assemblies have been slashed, and the availabl e weekly data on the output of appliances, 
lumber, and steel point to further declines in  those categories.  In  addition, the various 
new orders diffusion indexes—which help predict near-term ch anges in industrial 
production—have been exceptionally weak.  Th e Institute for Supply Management’s new 
orders diffusion index fell to the lowest le vel in its 60-year history, while the first 
readings on orders activity in January, fr om the New York and Philadelphia Federal 
Reserve Bank surveys, remained at very low levels.  
Motor Vehicles 
Motor vehicle demand remains very weak.  Sa les of new automobiles and light trucks 
totaled only 10.3 million units at an annual rate in December, and industry contacts report 
that sales so far this month have continued to run close to that pace.  Surveys of consumer 
attitudes toward car-buying conditions have shown some improvement over the past two months, as customer incentives were mainta ined at a generous level, and credit 
conditions, though still tight, appear to have improved.
2  Nonetheless, the surveys showed 
that many consumers remain concerned about the economic outlook and have postponed purchases of new vehicles.

Consumer Spending  
After having fallen at an annua l rate of 3.8 percent in the third quarter, real personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) apparently cont racted further in the fourth quarter of 
last year, as consumers con tinued to grapple with sizable losses of wealth, weakening 
labor market conditions, and tight credit cond itions.  The latest data on retail sales and 
consumer prices suggest th at real spending on goods excl uding motor vehicles fell 
1½ percent in December, more than reversi ng November’s increase; over the last six 
months of the year, real outlays  in this category are estimated to have fallen at an annual 
rate of 9¼ percent.  Motor vehicle outlays edged down further in the final two months of 
the year after a sharp declin e in October.  Though services  spending rose modestly in 
November—the last month of available data —its six-month moving average appears to 
have slowed, on net, over the course of last ye ar.  Early indicators of spending in January, 
including weekly chain store sales and indus try reports, point to continued soft demand 
so far this quarter. 
The fundamentals of consumer spending were  generally weak through the end of the 
year.  Household wealth contra cted sharply; house prices cont inued to decline steadily in 
the final months of 2008, and equity prices  dropped 30 percent between September and 
yearend.  While households drew some relief from sharply lower energy prices in the 
fourth quarter, large-scale and widespread  job losses likely pushed down nominal 
compensation and fueled greater uncertainty  about income.  Consistent with more 
cautious spending behavior, the personal savi ng rate rose further in November, to 
2.8 percent, after hovering near zero earlier in the year.  Meanwhile, the latest Senior 
Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lendi ng Practices suggests that banks further 
tightened the terms and standard s on consumer credit in recent months (see the appendix 
to the “Domestic Financial Developments” s ection).  In line with these challenging 
conditions, consumer sentiment remained at very low levels thr ough the end of 2008 and 
showed little improvement in early January. 
Housing  
Declines in housing activity st eepened in the last two months  of the year.  Single-family 
housing starts dropped at an average monthl y rate of 14 percent in November and 
December, much faster than the 4 percent av erage rate of decline seen in the first 
10 months of the year.  Adjusted permit issu ance in this sector—a useful month-ahead 
indicator of starts—was 7 percent below the level of star ts in December.  In the 
multifamily sector, starts plunged 34 percent in the last two months of 2008.  Although 
the contraction in multifamily star ts accelerated in the second half of the year, the decline

in activity from its peak is still a good bit sm aller than the comparable decrease in single-
family starts. 
Housing demand also remains very weak, reflec ting, in part, heighten ed uncertainty about 
employment and income prospects.  More over, expectations of  further house price 
declines are likely making many potential buye rs reluctant to purchase homes.  In 
November, the Census Bureau’s measure of new single-family home sales fell 3 percent 
to a level 35 percent below its year-earlier level.   
 
 
.  Although the stock of unsold new singl e-family homes continued to move down 
in November to a level one-third below its peak in mid-2006, inventories remain 
extremely elevated relative to  the current pace of sales. 
Sales of existing sing le-family homes dropped 8 percent in  November and were 9 percent 
below their year-earlier level.  Nevertheless, the decline in existing home sales over the 12 months ending in November was much smalle r than the 35 percent contraction in new 
home sales.  The comparative strength in exis ting home sales is partly attributable to 
increases in foreclosure-related and other di stressed sales, which tend to take place at 
much lower prices than t hose of owner-occupied homes.

Mortgage rates for prime borrowers move d somewhat lower recently.  Rates for 
conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell another 35 basis points from early 
December to mid-January after a somewhat larger decline in late November.  The 
nominal 30-year fixed mortga ge rate has ranged between 5.0 percent and 5.1 percent 
since late December; these values are the lowest since the series began in 1971.  In 
contrast, the market for nonconforming loans (t hat is, loans that cannot be purchased by 
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) remains severe ly impaired.  Although the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) has offered an alternat ive source of mortgage financing for some 
nonprime and near-prime borrowers, the FHA’s relatively strict lending standards and 
higher costs suggest that such lending is likely to have repl aced only a small part of the 
reduction in credit from other sources. 
                                                 
3 Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate agents, many 
foreclosure-related sales are included in the existing ho me sales statistics because banks frequently hire real 
estate agents to sell repossessed properties.

4 Unlike the FHFA index (formerly known as the OFHEO index, calculated by the Office of Federal 
Housing Enterprise Oversight), the LP index includes both conforming and nonconforming loans.  In 
addition, the LP index has better geographic coverage than the S&P/Case-Shiller (CS) index.  The LP and 
CS indexes showed similar movements from 2002 to 2007, but more recently the LP index has declined by less than the CS index. House prices remain on a downward trajectory.  The repeat-sales pr ice index for existing 
single-family homes calculated by LoanPerf ormance (LP)—a recently developed index 
that is more representative than either th e Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) or 
S&P/Case-Shiller indexes—fell 10 percent over the 12 months ending in November.4   
Equipment and Software  
Real equipment and software (E&S) investment contracted sharply towa rd the end of last 
year, and the declines appear to have en compassed all major spending categories.  
Business spending on transportation equipment has been falling for more than a year, 
while spending on computers and software began to step down in the third quarter.  More 
recently, incoming data on orders and shipment s suggest that spending outside of these 
two categories likely declined no ticeably in the fourth quarter after having been about flat 
over the first three quarters of the year.   
Forward-looking indicators of real E&S spending portray a grim outlook.  Monthly 
readings of overall business conditions—f rom both regional and national purchasing 
manager surveys—remain at extremely depressed levels.  In addition, credit conditions remain tight:  The latest Senior Loan Offi cer Opinion Survey indi cates that many banks 
further tightened lending sta ndards on commercial and industria l loans in recent months, 
and an increasing fraction of small businesses reported difficulty obtai ning credit in the 
December NFIB survey.  Corporate bond yields, and spreads over Treasury yields, have receded in recent weeks, but spr eads remain at very high levels. 
The steep decline in business outlays on transportation equipment continued into the fourth quarter.  Business purchases of light vehicles fell consider ably, though a boost in 
deliveries to daily rental companies pushed up sales in December.  Sales of medium and 
heavy trucks moved down in December, and new orders dropped noticeably.  Combined with lackluster volumes for freight shipping, th e lower level of orders  suggests that sales 
of medium and heavy trucks are likely to decl ine further in the near term.  Turning to 
aircraft, although the machinis ts’ strike and other producti on problems limited deliveries 
of Boeing’s planes for much of the fourth  quarter, deliveries rebounded in December and 
order books are full, an indication that domestic  aircraft investment will likely pick up 
this quarter.

5 These expenditures may not significantly increase refi ning capacity in the next year or two.  Because 
of the long time required to complete renovations to petroleum refineries, the new projects started in 2008 
are not likely to come online for some time.  Moreover , some of the recent construction may be aimed at 
maintaining existing capacity. In high-tech, business spending on computers declined sharply in the third quarter and 
appears to have fallen further in the fourth quarter.  Shipments of computers and 
peripherals continued to recede in the fourth quarter, and, as noted ea rlier, the industrial 
production index for computers shrank ag ain.  Similarly, domestic demand for 
communications equipment likely dropped off, as imports plummeted in October and November.  Other signs of weakening dema nd include layoff announcements and cuts to 
capital spending plans by a growing number  of prominent manufacturers of high-tech 
products. 
Spending on equipment other than high-tech and transportation appears to have fallen 
sharply in the fourth quarter after remaining about flat, on balance, over the first three 
quarters of last year.  In October and November, imports of capital goods dropped back, 
and orders and shipments posted steep declin es for many types of equipment; the most 
recent data show orders running well below shipments.  
Nonresidential Construction  
Nominal construction expenditu res on nonresidential buildings (that is, structures other 
than drilling and mining) rose 0.8 percent in November to a leve l 2 percent above the 
third-quarter reading.  Real i nvestment stagnated or declined for many types of buildings 
over the past six months.  In contrast, construction in the power and manufacturing 
sectors continued to increase briskly in the second half of 2008, as spending related to 
petroleum refining (a subcategory of the ma nufacturing sector) a nd power generation and 
distribution responded to the surge in en ergy prices in the first half of 2008.
5  
Construction in these sectors remained elevated  in the second half of the year even as 
energy prices plunged, but trade reports ha ve indicated that some already-begun 
petroleum refinery renovations have been canceled or delayed. 
Falling energy prices have also affected investment in drillin g and mining structures.  The 
latest data on drilling activity suggest that  real spending on these structures—which also 
increased substantially in the first three quarters of 2008—flattened out in the fourth 
quarter and dropped sharply in January.

6 The Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recorded a deficit of $485 billion for 
the three months ending in December.  This figure includes the cost of financial transactions related to the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  (Treasury and OMB treat capital purchases under the TA RP on a cash-flow basis and do not incorporate the 
GSEs as part of the federal government but instead scor e only the costs of financial transactions associated 
with placing the GSEs in conservatorship.) 
On January 7, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an update of its outlook for the federal 
budget.  The CBO’s budget projection includes the cost  of the TARP, estimated as  the net present value of 
all of the program’s financial transactions.  Also, CBO includes in the budget all of the outlays, revenues, and net financial losses associated with the GSEs, treating these institutions as part of the federal 
government.  For fiscal 2009 as a whole, CBO projects a deficit of almost $1.2 trillion, more than 8 percent 
of gross domestic product, or GDP.  Using CBO’s accounting methodology for the TARP and the GSEs, 
we estimate a deficit of $300 billion for the three months ending in December. Outside of energy-related construction, the fundamentals of nonresidential investment 
have deteriorated further and point to a contraction in real  construction outlays in coming 
quarters.  Vacancy rates continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the 
January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey suggests that financing for new construction 
projects has become even more difficult to ac quire.  In addition, the architectural billings 
index fell to an extremely low level in the fourth quarter, and the declines in 
nonresidential construction employment steepened. 
Business Inventories  
Firms continued to pare stocks of inventor ies through November, but with sales falling 
even more sharply, overhangs have devel oped in a number of areas.  For the nonfarm 
sector as a whole, the ratio of book-value inventories to sa les (excluding motor vehicles) 
continued its steep increase in October and November.  Similarly, the overall inventory 
picture from the staff’s flow-of-goods system has also deteriorated:  Real inventories 
appear to have declined at  a fairly brisk pace through December, but months’ supply 
reached an elevated level at year-end, a nd this deterioration was widespread across 
categories.  Finally, the Institute for S upply Management’s index of customers’ 
inventories has trended up over the past few months and remained well above 50 in 
December. 
Federal Government Sector  
In the first three months of fiscal 2009, the deficit in the federal unified budget widened 
significantly.6  Federal receipts dropped  nearly 10 percent relative to the same year-
earlier period.  Personal tax payments fell 3½ percent, likely because of slowing gains in 
nominal personal income and lower bonus pa yments and realized  capital gains.  
Corporate tax payments plummeted 45 percent re lative to the same period a year earlier, 
which reflected the decline in business profits .  After excluding fina ncial transactions

7 Annual expenditures refer to general fund expenditures only. 
8 PCE prices for December are staff estimates ba sed on data from the CPI and PPI releases. (such as those associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the conservatorship 
of the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises) and adjusting for payment-
timing shifts, federal outlays rose 8½ percent in the past three months relative to the same 
year-earlier period.  Weaken ing economic conditions booste d spending for low-income 
support programs, including unemployment insura nce benefits and food stamps.  Outlays 
for defense, federal health programs, and So cial Security also posted sizable advances 
relative to a y ear earlier.  
State and Local Government Sector  
Incoming data for the state and local government sector have been mixed.  The pace of 
hiring by these governments slowed to an average of 5,000 per m onth in the fourth 
quarter, well below the average monthly gain of approximately 15,000 during the first three quarters of 2008 and consistent with re ports of deteriorating fiscal conditions in 
many of these jurisdictions.  In contrast, co nstruction spending continued to expand at a 
fairly rapid clip:  Average nominal constr uction expenditures in October and November 
were 2 percent (not at an annual rate) above the third-quarter level.  
The National Association of State Budget Officers recently  reported that the sluggish 
inflow of state revenues has generated an
 aggregate budget gap across all states of 
$30 billion (equal to 4½ percent of annual expenditures).7  However, fiscal conditions 
vary significantly acro ss states:  California alone account s for one-third of the aggregate 
budget gap, whereas Texas, whose reserve funds  have been boosted in recent years by 
oil-related tax revenue, is facing relatively less fiscal st ress.  According to press reports, 
many states are moving to close their budge t gaps, largely by cutting spending and 
drawing down reserve funds. 
Prices 
Consum
er price inflation continued to slow  in the fourth quart er.  Overall personal 
consumption expenditure (PCE) prices are estimated to have fallen ½ percent in 
December and to have tumbled at an annual rate  of 8¼ percent in the last three months of 
2008.8  Over the 12 months ending in December, PCE prices rose ¾ percent after an 
average annual increase of 3 percent over the previous four  years.  Excluding food and 
energy, PCE prices are estimated to have been  essentially unchanged in December for the 
third consecutive month.  The 12-month change in core PCE prices slowed to 1¾ percent in 2008 from 2¼ percent in 2007.  The prices of goods at earlier stages of production, both for intermediate products and spot comm odities, have declined sharply since July.

II-32 
Consumer energy prices began to move dow n in August and are estimated to have 
dropped 9 percent in December after having pl unged 18 percent in November.  The drop 
in energy prices during the second half of la st year largely reflected the pass-through of 
falling crude oil prices to gasoline prices.  Crude prices have shown little trend since the 
middle of December, and the latest survey re adings suggest a small increase in retail 
gasoline prices in January. 
Consumer food price increases be gan to moderate toward the e nd of last year.  Over the 
past three months, consumer food prices incr eased at an annual rate of 3 percent, 
considerably less than the 9 per cent rise posted over the previous three months, albeit still 
well above the rate of change in other cons umer prices.  Agricultural commodity prices, 
as measured by the Commodity Research Bur eau (CRB) index of s pot foodstuffs, have 
declined substantially since July, largely reflecting fla gging demand (both at home and 
abroad) for domestic agricultural commodities.   Although farm prices have turned up a 
touch since the December Greenbook, this rise is  mainly attributable to weather-related 
concerns about the Latin American harves t rather than to strengthening demand.  
PCE prices excluding food and energy also decelerated sharply over the final three 
months of 2008.  The deceleration was fair ly widespread across categories, although it 
was particularly steep among goods (especially motor vehicles and apparel) and the more 
erratic services cate gories (especially lodging away from home and imputed banking 
services).  These recent soft price readings have been associated with heavy discounting 
in an environment of weak demand and exce ss inventories, as we ll as lessening cost 
pressures from energy, other materials, and imports.  Prices at earlier stages of pr ocessing have also retreated in recent months.  After rising 
rapidly during the first nine months of th e year, the producer price index for core 
intermediate materials tumbled at  an annual rate of 25 percent in the last three months of 
2008.  The recent drop in intermediate materials prices likely reflected some pass-through 
of a precipitous decline in commodity prices in the second half of last year.  Although 
commodity prices have moved up somewhat of late, the Journal of Commerce  index of 
industrial materials prices is nonetheless 41 percent below its level of 12 months earlier, 
while the CRB index of spot indus trials is 32 percent lower.   
Near-term inflation expectations in the Reut ers/University of Michigan survey have 
declined considerably in recent months.  The preliminary January reading of median 
expected inflation over the ne xt 12 months was 2.0 percent,  up a bit from December’s 
reading but substantia lly below its peak of 5.2 percent in May.  Meanwhile, median

expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 year s stood at 3.0 percent in early January, also 
up from last month but down from 3.4 percen t in May.  As discussed in the “Domestic 
Financial Developments” section, the incr ease in implied inflation compensation 
calculated from Treasury inflation-protected secu rities (TIPS) appear s to reflect improved 
liquidity conditions in the TIPS market more than a significant upward revision to 
inflation expectations. 
Labor Costs 
We have received very little information on labor costs since the December Greenbook.  
Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent in 
December, which brought the 12-month change to 3.7 percent, the same as its increase 
over the previous 12 months.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Over the intermeeting period, conditions in short-term funding markets improved, 
particularly after year-end.  However, investors’ concerns about the economy and the 
health of the banking industry appeared to in crease, and the expected path for the federal 
funds rate moved down.  Market participants currently expect the funds rate to remain 
within its current target ra nge through the middle of this year.  Yields on long-term 
nominal Treasury securities were little cha nged over the intermeeting period as a whole, 
and interest rates on conforming fixed-rate  home mortgages only edged down.  Broad 
equity-price indexes declined, and stock prices for banking institutions underperformed substantially.  Spreads on investment-grade  and speculative-grade corporate bonds fell 
over the intermeeting period but remained very  high by historical st andards.  While bond 
issuance by highly rated corporations was solid in recent weeks, issuance by lower-rated 
companies remained weak.  In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, sizable fractions of banks reported having tightened  lending standards 
and terms further on all major loan categories,  although the fractions were not as large as 
in recent surveys.       
 Financial Institutions  
Although investors’ concerns about financial in stitutions appeared to have eased early in 
the intermeeting period, the si gnificant fourth-quarter lo sses reported recently by a 
number of large banking institut ions contributed to a deteri oration in market sentiment 
toward the sector.  On net, bank stock pr ices plummeted over th e intermeeting period, 
and spreads on the credit default swaps of  large banking institutions rose.  Among the 
banks that have reported earnings to date—a group that cove rs most large institutions and 
about one-third of all publicly  traded banks—average losses in the fourth quarter were 
considerably worse than analysts had antic ipated.  Sizable increases in loan loss 
provisions contributed importa ntly to fourth-quarter lo sses, and several banks took 
appreciable one-time impairment charges by writi ng down the fair value of  certain assets.   
On January 16, Citigroup and Bank of Amer ica (BOA) announced large losses for the 
fourth quarter and, more important, major restructuring plans in c onjunction with their 
dismal fourth-quarter earnings reports.  Citi group provided a plan for dividing the firm 
into two units, and BOA announced a new ag reement with the Tr easury, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve that will protect the firm against 
the possibility of unusually large losses on a pool  of certain assets, th e large majority of 
which BOA assumed as a result of its acquisi tion of Merrill Lynch.  As part of the

Asset Relief Program in exchange for pr eferred stock with an 8 percent dividend. 
Short-Term Funding Markets  
Conditions in short-term funding markets improved, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period.  In interbank markets, spreads betw een Libor and overnight index swap rates 
(OIS) narrowed further, on net, reportedly helped, in part, by the ample dollar liquidity 
provided by a number of central banks over the turn of the year.  So far this month, 
Libor-OIS spreads for maturities of one month or less have been only slightly above the 
levels prevailing before the ons et of financial turmoil in the summer of 2007, while the 
three-month spread has remained somewhat above normal levels.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper soared in the weeks leading up to year-end, but pressures eased at 
the end of December.  Spreads on asset-back ed commercial paper (ABCP) continued to 
narrow, with spreads this mont h generally staying in the lower end of the range over the 
past year.  Unsecured commercial paper outstanding—at financial and nonfinancial 
firms—and ABCP outstanding were both little changed on net.   
Functioning of the market for repurchase agreements (repos) also continued to improve.  
Overnight rates for Treasury repos m oved up from near zero around the December 
FOMC meeting, and spreads between repo ra tes for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 
and for Treasury general collateral remained  volatile but trended down.  Although reports 
of narrower bid-asked spreads in many collateral markets suggest recent improvements in 
market functioning, volumes in the repo market generally remained low, and “haircuts” on collateral stayed high.  Fails to deliver co ntinued to decline from peak levels, owing, 
in part, to industry efforts to mitigate fails. 
Federal Reserve Facilities and Programs 
Through January 15, the level of total Federal Reserve assets decreased from the peak 
levels posted in mid-December.  Primary cr edit fell substantially, mainly because of 
reduced demand from a few foreign institut ions.  Credit outstanding under the Term 
Auction Facility decreased about $30 b illion over the period to around $420 billon.  
Borrowing through the Primary Dealer Credit Fa cility also continued to trend down, and 
the auctions under the Term S ecurities Lending Facility continued to be undersubscribed.  
Credit extended to American Intern ational Group was about unchanged.   
Credit extended under the ABCP Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) 
continued to trend down, as sizable net inflows to prime money market mutual funds

  relieved pressures on money fund managers to  sell ABCP in secondary markets to meet 
redemptions.  Despite the reduction in cred it extended, this program has reportedly 
continued to be an important backstop fo r money market mutual funds.  Meanwhile, 
credit extended under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility moved up to about  
$350 billion.  Most of this credit is due to mature at the end of January. 
The Federal Reserve conducted several aucti ons to purchase agency debt and agency 
MBS over the intermeeting period.  In total, the System Open Market Account purchased 
about $20 billion in agency debt and almost $34 billion in agency MBS.  The Federal 
Reserve announced that it expe cts the purchase of up to $100 b illion in agency debt and 
up to $500 billion of agency MBS to be completed by the end of June.  Spreads on agency debt were mixed, but market sentimen t appeared to improve  recently, and Freddie 
Mac and Fannie Mae issued long-term debt for the first time in several months.  Spreads 
on agency MBS decreased notably, on balan ce, over the intermeeting period.  Despite 
reports focusing on the financial condition of several Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), spreads on FHLB debt held fairly steady over the intermeeting period. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The expected path for the federal funds ra te edged down over the intermeeting period, 
including a notable decrease af ter the December FOMC statemen t.  Market participants 
were reportedly surprised by the size of the reduction in the ta rget rate at the meeting and 
by the statement that policy rates would likely remain at exceptionally low levels for 
some time.  On balance, market expectations  fell somewhat further in early January on 
weaker-than-expected economic data and rene wed concerns about losses at some large 
banks.  Current market quotes imply that the fe deral funds rate will tr ade within the target 
range set at the December meeting through the middle of this year.  Under our standard 
assumptions about term premiums, the expect ed effective rate increases gradually to 
about 50 basis points by the end of 2009 a nd to around 1½ percent by the end of 2010.  
However, current economic conditions could well have pushed term premiums higher than our standard assumption, which would im ply a flatter trajecto ry for the expected 
federal funds rate.  Indeed, in a survey  conducted by the New York Fed’s Domestic 
Trading Desk this week, none of the economists  at primary dealers reported expecting the 
first increase in the target federa l funds rate to occur this year. 
Over the intermeeting period, 2-year nomina l Treasury yields increased about 15 basis 
points, on net, while 10-year yields rose a bout 5 basis points.  Medium- and long-term 
yields dropped sharply after the FOMC announcement on December 16, apparently in

 part because investors interp reted the statement as suggest ing that the Federal Reserve 
might increase its holdings of long-term Treasury securities.  However, these price 
movements were more than reversed this month, reportedly on the unwinding of year-end 
positions and in anticipation of significant future issuance by the Treasury. 
Over the intermeeting period, yields on Treasur y inflation-protected securities (TIPS) 
decreased significantly across the term struct ure.  Thus, as measured by the difference 
between yields on nominal and inflation- protected Treasury se curities, inflation 
compensation over the next 5 years increased more than 100 basis points, to -30 basis 
points, while inflation compensation over th e next 10 years increased about 60 basis 
points, to around 1 percent.  According to ma rket reports, the sharp decreases in TIPS 
yields—and the associated increases in im plied inflation compensation—were more a 
reflection of improved liquidity  conditions in the TIPS market  than of significant upward 
revisions to inflation expectati ons.  Nonetheless, measures of  inflation expectations from 
the Reuters/University of Michigan and the Bluechip surveys also increased somewhat. 
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Over the intermeeting period, broad equity-pri ce indexes decreased a bout 3 percent, on 
net, and stock prices for banks substantially underperformed the broader market.  The 
spread between the 12-month forward trend-earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and 
an estimate of the real long-run Treas ury yield—a rough measure of the equity 
premium—remained extraordinarily wide.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 
index decreased, on net, but stayed  high by historical standards. 
Yields and spreads on corporate bonds decrea sed noticeably over the intermeeting period, 
particularly for speculative-grade firms,  but spreads remained extremely high by 
historical standards.  Measures  of liquidity in the secondary  market for speculative-grade 
corporate bonds showed substantial improvement .  In contrast, bid-asked spreads in the 
secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans (not shown) remained exceptionally 
wide.   
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 fi rms in the third quarter were about  
20 percent below year-earlier le vels, with profit declines concentrated in the financial 
sector.  Analysts’ profit forecasts for S&P 500 firms point to continued declines in the 
fourth quarter, and substantial decreases are now  expected for nonfinancial firms as well.

 remained quite negative, with substantial mar kdowns of profit forecasts for both financial 
and nonfinancial firms.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms deteriorated further over the past several months.  
In the third quarter, the aggregate leverage ra tio of nonfinancial firms continued to trend 
up, and the aggregate liquid-asset ratio continued to trend down.  In November, the pace of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades by Moody’s jumped to its highest monthly rate since 2002.  The downgrades were widesp read across sectors, but about 20 percent 
were accounted for by a few auto manufacturer s and parts suppliers.  Incomplete data 
suggest further heavy bond downgrades in Dece mber.  In addition, the share of corporate 
bonds outstanding rated “deep junk”—that is , bonds rated B- or below by Moody’s—
increased again in the fourth quarter, r eaching its highest level since the 1990-91 
recession.  The delinquency rate on commercia l and industrial (C&I) loans edged up in 
the third quarter from a low level, and th e six-month trailing bond default rate moved a 
bit higher in December, reflecting a dist ressed exchange of bonds by General Motors 
Acceptance Corporation (GMAC). 
Business Finance 
In the nonfinancial sector, gross bond issu ance has remained solid in January for 
investment-grade firms, but issuance has continued to be quite weak for speculative-
grade firms.  Nonfinancial commercial  paper outstanding has rebounded this month, 
likely because of lower spreads and the eas ing of year-end pressures.  C&I loans 
increased over the first two weeks of January, owing, in part, to increases at a few banks 
that funded a large merger in  the telecommunications industr y.  Factoring in the sizable 
volume of corporate bonds that have mature d this month, overall net debt financing by 
nonfinancial businesses has been moderate. 
In terms of equity issuance, both seasoned and initial offerings by nonfinancial 
corporations remained weak through mid-Januar y, with almost no issuance outside of the 
energy sector.  In the third quarter, equity retirements by nonfinancial firms continued to 
outpace the combined amount of private and pub lic issuance.  However, retirements from 
completed cash-financed mergers diminished  in the fourth quarter, and few firms 
announced new share repurchase programs. 
Gross public equity issuance by financial firms has been weak in January.  In contrast, 
financial firms have continued to issue large volumes of bonds under the Temporary 
Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) esta blished by the Federa l Deposit Insurance

 Corporation (FDIC), although issuance of bonds outside the program has been quite 
limited.  Debt issued under the FDIC program ha s generally traded at spreads to Treasury 
securities roughly in line with  those of agency debt.  The FDIC announced its intention to 
propose rule changes to exte nd the maximum maturity of its guarantee under the TLGP 
from 3 years to 10 years where the debt is  supported by collateral and the issuance 
supports new consumer lending. 
Commercial Real Estate Finance 
Amid further declines in property prices and a negligible volume of sales, growth of 
commercial real estate debt slow ed dramatically in the third quarter.  In addition, against 
the backdrop of a further deterioration in  loan performance, lending conditions in 
commercial real estate markets remained extremely tight.  The delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held by banks rose to ne arly 5 percent in the third quarter, which 
mainly reflected a further deterioration in the performance of construction loans for both 
residential and commercial properties.  The delinquency rate on mortgages held in pools of commercial mortgage-backed securities (C MBS) rose in December to its highest level 
since early 2005, in part because of deterioration in market fundamentals, as vacancy rates increased, and the growth of rents slowe d.  Prices of indexes of credit default swaps 
on CMBS have generally remained quite low this month. 
Household Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, average intere st rates on 30-year c onforming fixed-rate 
mortgages edged down almost 10 basis point s to about 5.1 percent, while rates for 
nonconforming jumbo mortgages dropped around 85 basis points to about 7.8 percent.  
The spread between interest rates on conforming fixed-rate  mortgages and the 10-year 
Treasury yield edged down, on net, over the intermeeting period, but remained unusually 
wide. 
In secondary mortgage markets, issuan ce of MBS by the housing-related government-
sponsored enterprises (GSEs) continued to decline in November, in part because of 
reduced mortgage originations amid lower house prices and tight credit conditions.  MBS 
issuance by Ginnie Mae decreased slightly  in November, and the non-agency MBS 
market remained closed.  Total home mortga ge debt outstanding d ecreased in the second 
and third quarters of 2008, the first two quarter ly declines in the history of the series, 
which began in 1951.

 Repeat-sales house price indexes continued to show substantia l widespread declines into 
the fourth quarter of last year.  Falling home prices and decreasing employment and 
income have continued to push up mortgage de linquency rates.  In November, just under 
4 percent of prime mortgages, about 13 percent of mortgages in alt-A pools, and around 
25 percent of subprime mortgage s were 90 or more days past  due or in foreclosure.  
These rates are well above their levels at the st art of last year and ha ve yet to flatten out. 
The credit quality of consumer loans has al so continued to deteri orate significantly.  
Delinquency rates for credit card loans in s ecuritized pools, for nonrevolving loans held 
by commercial banks, and for auto loans held  by captive finance comp anies have all risen 
significantly, on net, over the past year.  A ll three of these delinquency rates are now 
close to the levels seen  in the recession of 2001. 
Interest rates on variable-rate  credit card accounts fell ove r the intermeeting period, as 
spreads to comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed slightly from elevated levels.  
In contrast, interest rates for new auto loan s have risen in recent weeks, and spreads to 
comparable-maturity Treasury yields conti nued to trend higher.  Outstanding revolving 
and nonrevolving consumer credit contracted slightly over the thre e months ending in 
November.  Given the decline in consumer  spending, some of the drop-off reflects 
weaker demand for loans, but lenders also have  restricted the supply of credit in response 
to worsening loan performance and inactive markets for asset-backed securities.  
Although tight credit remains th e norm, at the end of December, GMAC announced that 
it was resuming lending to borrowers with credit scores below 700—a practice it stopped 
in the fall. 
Regarding selected household assets, long-term mutual f unds experienced sizable net 
outflows in December, although the pace of redemptions was slower than in prior 
months.  In contrast, money market funds at tracted considerable net inflows again in 
December, with prime money market funds accounting for a much larger share of the 
increase than government money market funds. 
Treasury Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury c onducted several auctions for nominal and 
inflation-indexed securities.  Treasury bill issuance totaled $675 billion, including  
$135 billion issued under the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).  Nonetheless, 
outstanding bills issued through January 22 under the SFP have fallen to about

 $175 billion from a peak of nearly $560 b illion in November.  Investor demand for 
Treasury bills continued to be strong, part icularly ahead of year-end.  Auctions of 
nominal longer-term securities were also well  received.  The auction for newly issued  
10-year TIPS had a stop-out rate well below market expectations and the highest bid-to-
cover ratio for any TIPS auction since January  2000.  Overall, foreign participation at 
Treasury auctions increased a bit, and foreign custody holdi ngs of Treasury securities 
continued to climb in recent weeks.  In contrast, foreign custo dy holdings of agency 
securities fell further. 
Treasury market functioning deteriorated in  late December but has improved some this 
month.  Ahead of year-end, bid-asked spreads for on-the-run Treasury securities rose to 
very high levels, but they have fallen sharply since the turn of  the year.  Other indicators, 
however, point to continued market strains.  Trading volume in the Treasury cash market 
tumbled in December and has been only a litt le higher so far this month.  In addition, 
spreads between yields on on- and off-the-r un Treasury securities have moved down only 
a bit this month from last month’s extremel y elevated average level, and yield-curve 
fitting errors have remained quite large, as investors evidently have continued to be 
reluctant to take positions that could profit from unusual price differe ntials across similar 
securities. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Issuance of long-term municipa l bonds stepped down a little in January, as did issuance 
of short-term securities.  A substantial number of municipal bonds experienced rating 
downgrades in the third quarter, amid concerns  about the fiscal outl ook for state and local 
governments.  Over the intermeeting period, sentiment among municipal bond investors 
appeared to improve markedly.  Yields  on long-term municipal bonds decreased 
noticeably, but ratios of munici pal bond yields to those on co mparable-maturity Treasury 
securities remained exceptionally high. 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 surged at an annual rate of about 27 percent in December, the fastest pace since 
September 2001.  A substantial increase in liquid deposits accounted for most of the 
expansion, but small time deposits and currenc y also increased briskly.  Within liquid 
deposits, demand deposits surged, perhaps reflecting the appeal—particularly among 
institutional investors—of the unlimite d FDIC guarantee of non-interest-bearing 
transaction accounts in an e nvironment with very low money market rates.  Small time 
deposits increased substantially again last month—despite a decline in their average

 yield—in large part because a number of commercial banks offered aggressive rates to 
build core deposits.  Persistent strong foreign demand for bank notes contributed to 
another sizable increase in currency last m onth.  Assets in retail money market mutual 
funds rose slightly in December, after having contracted the previous month.  
Commercial bank credit contract ed at an annual rate of al most 13 percent in December, 
its second consecutive monthly decrease.  A large portion of the decline in bank credit 
stemmed from a runoff of securities, some  of which had been financed through the 
AMLF.  In addition, total bank loans outstandi ng decreased at an annual rate of about  
5¾ percent last month.  C&I loans contracted  sharply, reportedly reflecting broad-based 
paydowns of existing loans and weaker demand for new loans.  Comm ercial real estate 
loans continued to grow mode rately last month, with some respondents to the January 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey attributing part of the rece nt growth in these loans to 
the shutdown of the CMBS market (see the appendix to this sect ion).  Residential 
mortgages held by banks decreased for the fourth month in a row; reportedly, last 
month’s decline was due in part to increased loan sales to the housing-related GSEs.  
With terms having remained relatively attr active, credit extended under revolving home 
equity lines rose substantia lly in December, even though a number of banks reported in 
the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey that they had trimmed the unused 
portion of such lines for some customers.  Although originations of consumer loans by 
banks slowed to an annual rate of just 1¾ percent in December, a sharp decrease in securitizations led to a 7½ percent increas e in banks’ on-balance- sheet holdings of 
consumer loans. 
The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey c onducted in January in dicated that banks 
continued to tighten standards and terms over the past three months on all major types of 
loans to businesses and households, although the net percentage of  banks doing so was 
generally lower than the record-high levels posted in the October survey.  All of the 
respondents in January who reported having ti ghtened lending sta ndards or terms on  
C&I loans cited the less favorable or more  uncertain economic environment as an 
important reason for having done so; also, most  of the respondents cited a worsening of 
industry-specific problems and a reduced toleran ce for risk at their institution.  On net, in 
January, significant fractions of banks reported weaker demand for most types of loans.

1 Respondent banks received the survey on or afte r December 30, 2008, and their responses were due 
January 13, 2009. Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
The January 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and households  over the past three 
months.  The survey also included three sets of sp ecial questions:  The first set asked banks about 
changes in lending policies on commercial real esta te loans over the past year and new extensions 
of such loans over the second half of 2008; the second set queried banks about changes in the size 
of existing credit lines for businesses and households ; and the third set asked banks about the use 
of interest rate floors in floating-rate loan ag reements with both businesses and households.  This 
appendix is based on responses from 53 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks.1 
In the January survey, the net fractions of res pondents that reported having tightened their lending 
policies on all major loan categories over the previous three months stayed very elevated.  
Relative to the October survey, these net fractions  generally edged down s lightly or remained 
unchanged.  Demand for loans from both busin esses and households at domestic institutions 
reportedly continued to weaken, on balance, over the survey period.  
In response to the special questions on commercial r eal estate lending, significant net fractions of 
both foreign and domestic instituti ons reported having tightened all queried loan policies over the 
past year.  At the same time, about 15 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that the 
shutdown of the securitization market for comme rcial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) since 
the middle of 2008 led to an increased volume of commercial real estate lending at their bank.  
Regarding the other special questions, banks al so reportedly reduced credit limits on existing 
credit lines across a wide range of borrowers and increased the use of interest rate floors in new 
loan agreements during 2008. 
Lending to Businesses 
Questions on commercial and industrial lending .  About 65 percent of domestic banks 
reported having tightened lending standards on co mmercial and industrial (C&I) loans to large 
and middle-market firms over the past three months, down from the percentage that reported 
tightening in the October survey but still above th e previous peaks reported in 1990 and 2001.  At 
about 70 percent, the fraction of domestic responde nts that tightened standards on C&I loans to 
small firms over the past three months was only slightly lower than the one reported in the 
October survey.  Significant majorities of domestic respondents indicated that they had further 
tightened price terms on C&I loans to firms of a ll sizes over the past three months.  Specifically, 
around 90 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had increased spreads of loan rates over

 their cost of funds for C&I loans to large and middle-market firms and to small firms—fractions 
comparable with those from the October survey; likewise, very high fractions of banks reported 
having charged higher premiums on riskier loans a nd having increased the costs of credit lines to 
firms of all sizes over the survey period. 
On net, the fractions of banks that reported ha ving tightened nonprice terms on C&I loans to large 
and middle-market firms over the past three mont hs stayed at an elevated level but declined 
relative to the October survey.  Large fractions of  banks continued to note that they had reduced 
both the maximum size and the maximum maturity of loans or credit lines to firms of all sizes.  In 
addition, about 70 percent of all domestic respondents reported having tightened covenants on 
C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, a nd about 60 percent reported having done so on 
such loans to small firms. U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also tightened their business lending stance further 
over the past three months.  About 65 percent of fo reign institutions, a slightly smaller percentage 
than in October, indicated that they had firm ed their lending standards on C&I loans in the 
January survey.  Large fractions of foreign r espondents had tightened most price and nonprice 
terms on C&I loans over the survey period, incl uding increasing the premiums charged on riskier 
loans, raising the cost of credit lines, and reduc ing the maximum size of credit lines.  Foreign 
banks also reported that over the past three mont hs they had imposed more-restrictive policies on 
loan covenants and collateraliza tion requirements for C&I loans. 
All domestic and foreign responde nts pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain economic 
outlook as a reason for tightening their lending standards and terms on C&I loans over the past 
three months.  Most respondents indicated that a worsening of industry-specific problems, along with their bank’s reduced tolera nce for risk, were also important factors in their decision to 
tighten C&I lending policies.  In contrast, only about 25 percent of the domestic respondents that had tightened standards or terms over the past th ree months noted that a deterioration in their 
bank’s current or expected capital position had contributed to the change, down from 
approximately 40 percent in the October survey.  Large fractions of foreign respondents pointed 
to decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans (75 percent of respondents) and an 
increase in defaults by borrowers in public debt  markets (70 percent of respondents) as reasons 
for tightening standards and terms on C&I loans.   
On balance, domestic and foreign respondents reported a further weakening of demand for C&I 
loans over the past three months.  On net, about 60 percent of domestic respondents reported a reduction in demand for such loans from firms of a ll sizes.  About 25 percent, on net, of U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks saw a decrease in demand for C&I loans over the past 
three months, compared with the 5 percent of respondents that, on net, had reported an increase in 
C&I loan demand in the October survey.

2 Even though the survey question asks banks to exclude refinancing, reported demand often increases 
in periods in which refinancing has picked up.  The decline in the fraction for weaker demand likely 
reflects, in part, the rise in refinancing activ ity triggered by lower mortgage rates.     Substantial majorities of the domestic institutions  that had experienced weaker demand for C&I 
loans over the past three months pointed to d ecreases in their customer s’ needs to finance 
investment in plant and equipment, to finance mergers and acquisitions, to finance inventories, 
and to finance customer accounts receivable as reasons for the weaker demand.  Among the few 
domestic respondents that saw an increase in loan demand over the past three months, all 
indicated that business borrowing had shifted to their bank from other bank or nonbank sources because these other sources had become less attractiv e.  In addition, more than 30 percent of 
domestic and foreign institutions, on net,  reported that inquiries from potential business 
borrowers had decreased during the survey period.   
Questions on commercial real estate lending .  On balance, about 80 percent of domestic banks 
reported that they had tightened their lending st andards on commercial real estate (CRE) loans 
over the past three months, slightly less than the roughly 85 percent that had reported doing so in 
the October survey.  Fifty percent of foreign r espondents also indicated that they had tightened 
their lending standards on CRE loans over the survey period.  On net, about 55 percent of 
domestic and foreign respondents reported weak er demand for CRE loans over the past three 
months. 
Special questions on commercial real estate lending .  Significant net fractions of banks 
reported having tightened many CRE loan terms.   Over 2008 as a whole, the net fraction of 
domestic banks that increased their loan rate  spreads was about 95 percent, while about 
80 percent tightened their loan-to-value ratios.   About 30 percent of the domestic respondents 
indicated that the shutdown of the CMBS securiti zation market had led to an increase in CRE 
lending at their bank over the second half of 2008.   In contrast, about 15 percent of domestic 
banks reported a reduction in the volume of CRE lending as a result of the shutdown of the 
CMBS securitization market in the second half of last year.   
Lending to Households 
Questions on residential real estate lending .  Smaller, though still s ubstantial, fractions of 
domestic respondents continued to report having tightened their lending standards on prime and 
nontraditional residential mortgages in the Ja nuary survey.  About 45 percent of domestic 
respondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages over the 
past three months and almost 50 percent of the 25  banks that originated nontraditional residential 
mortgage loans over the survey period reported having tightened their lending standards on such loans.  About 10 percent of domestic responde nts saw weaker demand, on net, for prime 
residential mortgage loans over the past three m onths, also a significantly lower fraction than the 
roughly 50 percent that so reported in the October survey.

 slightly lower than in the October survey —reportedly experienced weaker demand for 
nontraditional mortgage loans over the same period.  Only four banks reported making subprime 
mortgage loans over the past three months. 
On net, about 60 percent of domestic respondents,  down from 75 percent in the October survey, 
noted that they had tightened their lending standards for approving applications for revolving 
home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) over the past three months.  Twenty percent of domestic banks, on net, reported weaker de mand for HELOCs over the past three months, slightly less than 
the fraction that had reported weaker demand in the October survey.  
Questions on consumer lending.  Large fractions of domestic banks again reported a tightening 
of standards and terms on both credit card and othe r consumer loans over the past three months.  
Nearly 60 percent of respondents indicated that they had tightened lending standards on credit 
card and other consumer loans, about the same fractions as in the October survey.  Close to 
55 percent of respondents also reported having re duced the extent to which credit card accounts 
were granted to customers who did not meet thei r bank’s credit-scoring thresholds, and a similar 
fraction reported pulling back from granting other ki nds of consumer loans to such customers.  
Roughly 45 percent of the respondents also reported having raised minimum required credit scores on credit card accounts and other consumer loans over the past three months, a proportion that is slightly lower than in the October su rvey.  About 45 percent of banks reported having 
lowered credit limits to either new or existing credit card customers, down from the 60 percent that had reported doing so in the October survey.   
On net, about 15 percent of domestic banks indicat ed that they had become either somewhat or 
much less willing to make consumer installment loans over the past three months, a decrease 
from roughly 45 percent in the October survey.  About 45 percent of respondents, on net, 
indicated that they had experienced weaker dema nd for consumer loans of all types over the past 
three months, similar to the fraction in the October survey. 
Special Questions on Existing Credit Lines    
The January survey included a special question th at queried banks on how they had changed the 
sizes of credit lines for existing customers for a number of account types over the past three 
months.  On net, domestic banks reported that th ey had reduced the size of existing credit lines 
for all major types of business and household accounts.  Regarding existing accounts for 
businesses, roughly 60 percent, on balance, reported a decrease in the limits on CRE accounts, about 50 percent indicated a decrease in the limits on credit lines extended to financial firms, about 30 percent indicated a decrease in cr edit limits on business credit card accounts, and 
roughly 25 percent noted a decrease in the size of C&I credit lines.  On net, a large fraction of 
foreign banks also decreased limits on CRE lines of credit, credit lines extended to financial 
firms, and C&I credit lines.  Regarding existing accounts for households, on net about 40 percent 
III-A-9 
 
 of domestic banks reported having reduced the sizes of existing home equity lines of credit and 
approximately 35 percent having trimmed exis ting consumer credit card account limits. 
Special Questions on the Use of Interest Rate Floors    
The January survey also included a special questi on regarding the use of interest rate floors in 
floating-rate loan agreements during 2008.  Eighty percent of domestic banks reported an increase 
in their use of interest rate floors in such agreements with businesses last year.  About 45 percent of domestic banks reported an increase in the use of such rate floors on loans to households over the same period.  No domestic bank reported a reduc tion in the use of interest rate floors on loans 
to businesses or households last year.  Large frac tions of domestic banks, however, reported that 
less than 5 percent of their outstanding loans—to both households a nd businesses—currently had 
interest rate floors that were binding, while only a small number of respondents indicated that a majority of their outstanding loans to house holds or businesses had binding rate floors.

U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply to $40.4 billion in November from 
$56.7 billion in October as a steep decline in imports outweighed a sizable fall in exports.  
November’s trade deficit is the smallest recorded since the end of 2003.   
The value of exports of goods and services fell 5.8 percent in November.  Much of this 
fall was due to a decline in exports of fuels, chemicals, and other industrial supplies, 
which in part reflects lower prices for these goods.  All other major categories of exports 
moved down as well. 
The average value of exports in October and November decreased 33.6 percent at an 
annual rate relative to the third quarter, largely as a result of a fall in exports of industrial 
supplies and capital goods.  The fall in exports of industrial supplies reflected both lower 
prices, especially for fuels and chemicals, as well as a decline in volume of exports.  The 
de
cline in exports of capital goods importantly reflected lower aircraft exports from 
Boeing stemming from a strike that lasted through October as well as production 
difficulties in November.  All other major categories of exports also moved down.

 The value of imports of goods and services declined 12 percent in November.  More than 
ha
lf of this decline was accounted for by a decline in imports of oil, mostly reflecting a 
dramatic decrease in pric es but also declining volumes.  Imports of all other major 
categories reco rded sizable decreases.  Imports of capital goods fell on account of lower 
imports of computers and machinery.  Imports of consumer goods were pulled down by a 
significant fall in imports of pharmaceuticals and household goods.       
The average value of imports in October and November decreased about 40 percent at an 
annual rate relative to the third quarter.  The decrease reflected a large decline in the 
value of oil imports, because of substantially lower prices.  Imports of capital goods, 
automotive products, other industrial supplies, consumer goods, and services also 
decreased.   
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  Following November’s 2  percent decline, which was the largest one-
month decline over the 14-year history of the index, prices of core imports fell 
1.3 percent in December.  Almost all of the December drop was due to a 5.7 percent fall 
in the prices for non-fuel industrial supplies, reflecting lower prices for metals and 
chemicals.  Compared with November, prices in other categories either declined at a 
slower pace or moved up.  After falling almost 0.5 percent in November, prices for 
a
utomotive products and capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors fell only 
0.2 percent in December.  After falling sharply in November, prices for imported foods 
and consumer goods rose in December.   
The average level of core import prices in the fourth quarter was an annual rate of 
11½ percent below the third quarter average, as prices in all major su b-categories posted 
declines.  The main contributors to the overall price decline were foods and non-fuel 
industrial supplies, whose prices fell at annual rates of 18 percent and 33 percent, 
respectively.  In contrast, the average price of imported finished goods declined at a pace 
of only ¾ percent. 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil fell nearly 30 percent in 
November and declined an additional 21 percent in December.  The index has fallen for 
five consecutive months and declined more than 47 percent for the year as a whole.  The 
spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil also fell in both November and 
December, dropping 46 percent from its October level of $77 per barrel to an average of 
$41 in December.  Since that time oil prices have been quite volatile amid concerns about 
IV-5 
 
 demand and supply uncertainties stemming from conflict in the Middle East, natural gas 
disruptions in Europe, and OPEC production cuts.  The spot price of WTI closed on 
January 21 at $42.25 per barrel.  
Exports.  Following a 4 percent decline in November, prices of exported core goods fell 
2.8 percent in December.  The slower pace of decline was most notable in the prices of 
nonagricultural industrial supplies, which fell 8.4 percent in November, but declined only 
6 percent in December.  After a 7.3 percent drop in November, prices of exported 
agricultural products fell an additional 6.5 percent in December.  Prices of finished goods 
fell 0.1 percent in December after falling 0.4 percent in the previous month.   
The average level of core export prices in the fourth quarter was 25 percent at an annual 
rate below the third quarter average, as prices for material-intensive goods fell sharply.  
Prices for agricultural products and non-agricultural supplies fell at annual rates of 
54 percent and 45 percent, respectively.  The average price for exported finished goods 
wa
s up at an annual rate of 1 percent from the third quarter average, despite declining 
prices in November and December.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the December Greenbook, we have received U.S. balance of payments data for the 
third quarter of 2008, Treasury data on U.S. international financial transactions for 
November, and balances in custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
(FRBNY) through mid January.  As has been the case for several quarters, the 
composition of U.S. flows continues to show a “flight to safety” and a general 
deleveraging.   In addition, the most recent Treasury data show a net outflow from 
foreign official sources as several countries drew down their dollar reserves in exchange 
market operations aimed at supporting their currencies.  
After recording large net inflows through September, official foreigners reduced their 
holdings in the United States in both October and November (line 1 of the “Summary of 
U.S. International Transactions” table and the chart “Foreign Official Financial Inflows 
through November 2008”).   
.   Custody data from FRBNY 
point to a return to small inflows in December.  As has been the case for several quarters, 
foreign official investors have continued to shift their holdings out of agencies into 
Treasury securities.   
Large drawings on the reciprocal currency swap facilities (included in line 2) generated 
significant official outflows in September and October, as Federal Reserve deposit claims 
at the partner central banks increased.  In November, the outstanding drawings declined a 
bit, which generated a small inflow.   
As the partner central banks in the swap arrangements lent these dollar funds in their 
domestic markets, there appears to have been some easing in funding pressures in Europe 
as evidenced by a reduction in loans by European-owned banks in the United States to 
their foreign parents.  All told, the net banking position with foreigners (line 3) posted an 
unprecedentedly large net inflow of $181 billion in October, followed by a smaller net 
inflow of $43 billion in November.   
The ongoing financial crisis has been associated with a contraction in gross cross-border 
positions, consistent with the general process of deleveraging seen elsewhere in the 
financial system.   Foreign private investors sold, on net, $27 billion of U.S. securities in 
November (line 4).  Net sales of U.S. securities are rare (see the top-left panel of the chart 
“Private Security Flows through November 2008”).  Further, the composition of these  
 
 
 

IV-9 
 
 positions has become even more heavily weighted toward Treasury securities.  Private 
foreigners, on net, purchased $10 billion in Treasury securities in November (line 4a), 
while continuing to sell agency bonds (line 4b) and corporate bonds (line 4c).  Foreign 
net purchases of equity were minimal in November (line 4d), following significant net 
sales in October. 
U.S. residents are also paring back their positions in foreign securities.  After many years 
of quarterly net purchases, U.S. residents, on net, sold $84 billion in foreign long-term 
securities in the third quarter of 2008 (line 5).  The pace of net sales then increased to $34 
billion in October and $33 billion in November.   
Turning to the latest balance of payments release, flows of both U.S. direct investments 
abroad (line 6) and foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) declined 
significantly in the third quarter as corporations reduced their intercompany debt 
positions.  U.S. residents decreased their holdings of foreign short-term securities and 
deposits abroad (available only quarterly and included in line 10), which generated an 
inflow as these investments returned home.  Increased borrowing by U.S. non-bank 
residents directly from foreign banks also contributed to the inflow recorded in line 10.  
The statistical discrepancy in the third quarter declined to a still sizable positive $40 
billion, indicating some combination of over reporting of the current account deficit or 
under r
eporting of net financial inflows.

 Foreign Financial Markets 
Conditions in foreign financial markets have been relatively calm since the time of the 
December Greenbook, although concerns about bank earnings and the stability of the 
global banking system appeared to grow late in the period.  One-month Libor-OIS 
spreads in euro and sterling narrowed, though by less than the spread in dollars.  The 
basis spread implied by foreign exchange swaps between the dollar and the euro rose 
slightly in mid-December, consistent with continued dollar funding pressure for some 
institutions, but the spread declined significantly ahead of the year-end as firms appeared 
able to secure funds.  Both investment-grade and lower-rated corporate bond spreads 
continued to rise in Canada but they decreased slightly in the euro area and changed little 
in the United Kingdom.   
Governments in major foreign economies initiated several actions aimed at easing credit 
market strains. On January 19, U.K. authorities introduc ed an asset protection scheme to 
insure certain bank assets for a fee, extended the government ’s debt guarantee for bank 
funding from April to the end of 2009 and introduced a scheme to guarantee asset-backed 
securities issued by banks, authorized a new facility for the purchase of high-quality 
assets by the Bank of England, and extended the maturity date for borrowing from the 
B
ank of England’s discount window to up to one year.  At the same time, the government 
pr
omised to negotiate commitments to lend more funds to the private sector from banks 
participating in its programs.  The French government also authorized a further capital 
injection of 10.5 billion euro into the country's top 6 banks, similar to its first capital 
injection last October; in Germany, the Financial Markets Stabilization Fund (SoFFin) 
extended the guarantee granted to Hypo Real Estate Group by an additional 12 billion 
euro; and the Irish government nationalized Anglo Irish Bank.  Earlier in the period, the 
Irish government inject ed 5.5 billion euro in several banks; the United Kingdom relaxed 
the terms of its bank credit guarantees; the Bank of Japan announced that it would 
increase its purchase of Japanese government bonds, including longer-term bonds, and 
would purchase commercial paper outright; and, after more than a year of negotiations, 
the Canadian government was able to broker an agreement to restructure a substantial 
portion of asset-backed commercial. 
Long-term sovereign bond yields in the advanced foreign economies dropped in the 
period after the December Greenbook, as inflationary pressures declined and expectations 
of easier monetary policy mounted.  Ten-year nominal sovereign bond yields dropped on 
net 11 to 20 basis points in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany and 40 basis points 
in Canada.  Market volatility continued to be high amid further uncertainty about the 
IV-14 
 
 
 severity and the duration of the ongoing global recession and amid mounting concerns 
over the stability of the global banking system. The FTSE, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx, 
Japan’s TOPIX, and the S&P 500 declined 4½ to 11½ percent.  Banking  sector share 
prices underperformed the major indexes. 
The major currencies index of the dollar has risen about ½ percent on net since the time 
of the December Greenbook, with the dollar depreciating about 5 percent against the yen 
but appreciating 7½ percent against sterling and ¾ to 1½ percent against the euro and 
Canadian dollar.  Expectations that euro-area monetary policy would remain relatively 
tight compared with the U.S. policy contributed to the weakness of the dollar against the 
euro at the beginning of the period.  The dollar subsequently strengthened against the 
euro, however, as comments by European Central Bank (ECB) officials, together with 
lower r
eadings on inflation in the euro area, suggested a growing inclination to ease 
policy.  On January 15, the ECB cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, to 2 percent.  Weak 
data in the United Kingdom and Japan also contributed the dollar’s recent rebound.  
Implied volatilities in most currency pairs remained elevated, although well below the 
multiyear highs reached in October. 
I
n aggregate, the dollar has also increased ½ percent against the currencies of our other 
important trading partners since the time of the December Greenbook.  The dollar has 
depreciated 3¾ percent against the Brazilian real and has appreciated 3¼ and ½ percent 
versus the Mexican peso and the Chinese renminbi.  There continued to be reports of 
foreign exchange intervention by a number of emerging market countries in support of 
their domestic currencies. Russia allowed 15 small devaluations in the last two months, 
bringing the currency’s overall devaluation against the dollar to about 1 8 percent since 
mid-December.  More than $100 billion of reserves were used in the last five months to 
defend the ruble.  Of note, on December 30, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United 
Arab Emirates signed a long-negotiated pact to form a currency union in 2010. 
Equit
y prices in Latin America and emerging Asia have been less volatile than in earlier 
periods.  Equity indexes were mixed in most Asian and Latin American countries, and 
dropped 19 and 3½ percent in Hong Kong and China, respectively.  Equity markets in 
many
 emerging market economies were likely supported by further steps by governments 
to help stabilize funding markets and to increase spending.  Sovereign yield spreads in 
Latin America and emerging Asia declined significantly since mid-December but remain 
quite elevated.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Recent indicators of economic activity suggest that output contracted sharply in the 
fourth quarter in the advanced foreign economies.  The pace of job losses rose, and 
measures of spending on durables and investment goods showed declines everywhere.  
Trade and industrial production plunged in Japan, and deteriorated further in Europe.  
According to forward-looking indicators, households and businesses are downbeat, amid 
deteriorating labor markets, tight credit conditions, and recent large falls in asset prices.  
In the euro area and the United Kingdom, confidence indicators are at or near their 
weakest levels since the recession in the early 1980s, and Purchasing Managers Indexes 
(PMIs) are at survey lows.  In Japan, consumer confidence is at an all-time low, and the 
manufacturing PMI survey points to a sharp fall in output and new orders. 
Consumer price inflation has continued to decline in the advanced economies, pushed 
down by lower oil prices.  Excluding food and energy prices, the movement in consumer 
prices has been more contained.  Over the intermeeting period, all major central banks 
lowered their policy rates.  The Bank of Japan intends to conduct additional outright 
purchases of government bonds and acquire commercial paper.  The U.K. government 
announced that it would set up a fund to allow the Bank of England (BOE) to purchase 
high quality private-sector assets for financial stability and monetary policy purposes. 
IV-21 
 
 
IV-22 
 
 
 Recent Japanese  indicators point to a large fall in fourth-quarter activity, after GDP 
contractions in the previous two quarters.  Industrial production declined a record 
8.5 percent in November, a figure significantly larger than the previous record monthly 
decline of 5.4 percent set in 1954.  Real exports collapsed in December, contributing to a 
record decline of 24.4 percent on a 12-month basis. 
On the household side, housing starts have fallen sharply, down 16 percent over the three 
months ending in November.  Nominal retail sales fell a little more than 1 percent over 
the same period, while consumer confidence remained near its historical trough.  
Although the unemployment rate remained relatively low, a more reliable indicator of 
Japanese labor market conditions, the job openings- to-applicants ratio (the number of 
officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers), 
dropped to its weakest level since early 2004. 
Japanese 12-month consumer price inflation was 1.0 percent in November, down sharply 
from the 2.3 percent peak reached in July, reflecting a decline in energy prices.  
Excluding food and energy prices, consumer prices were unchanged from the previous 
year. 
The Bank of Japan lowered its policy rate 20 basis points to 0.1 percent in December.  
Although the rate remains above zero, the Bank of Japan is taking many measures 
reminiscent of the earlier quantitative easing period, including the purchase of 
commercial paper and government bonds. 
IV-23 
 
IV-24 
 
 
 In the euro area , indicators for the fourth quarter generally point to significant weakness.  
Industrial production and the value of international trade fell further in October and 
November, and although the volume of retail sales increased 0.6 percent in November, its 
trend remains solidly negative.  The unemployment rate increased to 7.8 percent in 
November, the highest rate in  two years.  Euro-area PMIs, consumer and industrial 
confidence indicators, and the German Ifo business climate index all fell further in 
December. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area moderated to 1.6 percent in 
December.  Excluding energy and unprocessed food, it edged down to 2.1 percent.  
Twelve-month energy price inflation in December was -3.7 percent, down from the peak 
of 17 percent in July. 
In the last few months, several governments —including those of Germany, France, Italy, 
and Spain —announced fiscal stimulus packages.  The measures adopted so far include 
only modest corporate tax credits for new investment or increases in expenditures on 
public infrastructure.  On January 14, German authorities unveiled a second fiscal 
stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euro (2 percent of GDP).  The package, which 
stretches over the next two years, includes infrastructure investment, aid to the auto 
sector, modest tax cuts, and new credit guarantees for struggling businesses. 
At its January 15 meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its policy rate 50 basis 
points to  2 percent.  In recent statements, members of the E CB Governing Council have 
hinted that, given the step-down in inflation, further monetary policy easing is likely.   
IV-25 
 
IV-26 
 
 
 In the United Kingdom,  real GDP growth was revised down to -2.6 percent (a.r.) in the 
third quarter, reflecting greater drag from investment and net exports than was previously 
estimated.  Incoming data point to substantial weakness in the fourth quarter.  The 
contraction in industrial production steepened to -6.9 percent in November on a 12-month 
basis, a sharper pace of decline than during the recession in the early 1990s.  The volume 
of goods exported in November stood 9.0 percent below its third-quarter level, while 
imports of goods were 5.5 percent lower.  Unemployment claims rose further in 
December, and retail sales were flat relative to their third-quarter level in November.  
December PMI readings, all at or near survey lows, were consistent with a severe 
contraction in the manufacturing, services, and construction sectors. 
The slump in the housing sector continued unabated.  The main house price indicators 
fell over 2 percentage points in December, bringing cumulative declines relative to the 
peak of the market in late 2007 to just below 20 percent.  The number of loans approved 
for house purchases fell to 27,000 in November compared with an average of about 
110,000 per month over the period from 2001 to 2007. 
Inflationary pressure has subsided substantially.  The 12-month change in the producer 
price index tumbled to 4.3 percent in December, down from a peak of 34.1 percent in 
June.  Headline consumer price inflation fell to 3.1 percent in the year to December, 
pushed down by a 2.5 percentage point reduction in the value-added tax, effective 
December 1. 
On January 8, the BOE lowered its main policy rate 50 basis points to 1.5 percent, the 
lowest level since the institution was found ed in 1694.  Four days later, the U.K. 
government announced an additional £500 million ($720 million) in subsidies over the 
next two years to encourage firms to hire and train unemployed workers.  On January 19, 
the Chancellor stated that it would authorize the BOE to purchase high quality private-
sector assets in order to promote financial stability and conduct monetary policy.  Initial 
purchases of up to £50 billion will be allowed, funded by the issue of Treasury bills.  The 
government will also offer, for a fee, guarantees to deposit-taking institutions against 
future losses on their assets.

 In Canada , fourth-quarter indicators suggest that the economy contracted, following 
growth of 1.3 percent (a.r.) in the previous quarter .  Real GDP by industry fell 0.1 percent 
in October, and corresponding figures for preceding months were revised down.  The 
Ivey Purchasing Managers Index, which stood at 61 in September, dropped sharply in the 
fourth quarter, reaching 39.1 in December.  Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in November, and 
wholesale sales contracted 3.0  percent.  Real exports were 9.6 percent lower in November 
than a year earlier, while real imports were down 8.6 percent over the same period.  
Imports of machinery and equipment, a good indicator of fixed investment, fell 
5.8 percent in the year to November. 
Following modest employment gains in October, which were largely attributable to 
government hiring for the national election, the Canadian economy experienced sharp job 
losses in November and December.  The unemployment rate reached 6.6 percent in 
December, up from 6.1 percent in the third quarter. 
The housing market weakened significantly over the second half of 2008.  Housing starts 
were down 4 percent in December relative to 12 months earlier, and the value of building 
permits fell 20.5 percent in the year to November.  The index of new house prices fell 
0.4 percent and 0.3 percent in October and November, respectively; these were the first 
monthly declines since 1998. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell 0.6 percentage point to 2.0 percent in 
November.  The decline was due largely to the fall in gasoline prices.  Measures of core 
inflation rose over that period due to smaller price decreases for purchasing and leasing 
passenger vehicles than a year earlier.  Average hourly wages rose 4.3  percent in the 
12 months to December.  On January 20, the Ba nk of Canada lowered its policy rate 
50 basis points to 1 percent.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Economic activity in the emerging market economies appears to have slowed 
significantly further in the fourth quarter, with data received thus far strongly suggesting 
a contraction.  Korean GDP declined sharply in the fourth quarter, and Chinese real GDP 
stagnated according to staff estimates.  Industrial production, trade, and confidence 
indicators registered declines across many other countries in both emerging Asia and 
Latin America.  After some initial improvement, emerging equity markets have generally 
declined on net since the time of the December Greenbook.  In emerging Asia, headline 
inflation continued to fall, largely reflecting the steep decline in global commodity prices, 
but inflation remained stubbornly high in Latin American countries, likely owing in part 
to recent depreciation of their currencies.  Consequently, Asian authorities have had 
greater scope for expansionary policies than their counterparts in Latin America. 
In China , real GDP growth slowed to ¼ percent in the fourth quarter, as plummeting 
external demand led to declines in manufacturing.  The level of exports has fallen each 
month since September, and December exports were below year-ago levels.  The value of 
imports has fallen to an even greater degree, reflecting the combination of a decline in 
processing trade and lower prices of commodities.  Consequently, China’s trade surplus 
expanded to record levels in November and December.  Industrial production fell in the 
fourth quarter, and the purchasing managers index remained in the contraction range.  
Levels of production in the steel, auto, and electricity sectors in November were all below 
year-earlier levels.  One bright spot has been retail sales growth, which remained above 
20 percent on a 12-month basis in November.  With the slowing of the economy and 
declines in commodity prices, 12-month headline and producer price inflation dropped 
sharply in the fourth quarter. 
In response to the economic slowdown, Chinese authorities moved aggressively to 
provide fiscal and monetary stimulus.  Since the December Greenbook, the Peoples’ 
Bank of China has reduced the one-year lending rate 27 basis points, bringing the total 
reduction since September to 216 basis points.  Banks’ required  reserves were also 
reduced in December.  In addition to looser monetary policy and the large fiscal stimulus 
package announced in December, Chinese authorities are encouraging faster loan growth.

In India, recent indicators point to a rapid deceleration in economic output in the fourth 
quarter.  Industrial production fell sharply in October and partially rebounded in 
November.  Consumer price inflation remained above 9 percent on a twelve-month basis 
in November, although wholesale price inflation, which is more closely followed in the 
case of India, fell more than 4 percentage points from October to December.  The current 
account deficit remained at about 2 percent of GDP in the third quarter. 
In response to the slowing economy, the Reserve Bank of India lowered its policy rate, 
the repurchase agreement rate, 100 basis points and the prime lending rate 75 basis points 
earlier this month.  In addition, the government has eased credit to the export and auto 
sectors and removed a ceiling on overseas borrowing.  Fiscal policy is somewhat 
constrained by spending that is already $17 billion above the government’s target, and 
authorities have announced that there will not be any additional measures through March, 
the end of the fiscal year.

1 The NIEs are Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan 
In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs ),1 economic activity contracted sharply in 
the fourth quarter.  In Korea, real GDP contracted at more than a 20 percent annual rate 
in the fourth quarter.  In Singapore, a preliminary estimate of real GDP growth indicates 
a double-digit decline, reflecting a fall in exports and weak domestic demand.  Elsewhere 
in the region, recent readings on exports, industrial production, and indicators of 
domestic demand, such as PMI surveys, retail sales, and consumer and business 
sentiment also point to shrinking output.  Unemployment has risen in all of the countries.  
Despite falling exports, trade balances generally rose or remained in surplus owing to 
sizable declines in imports, which reflect lower commodity prices and weaker domestic 
demand.  In Taiwan, for example, the level of exports and imports in December were 
both down about 40 percent from a year earlier. 
Inflation declined further across the NIEs as energy and, in some cases, food prices 
continued to retreat.  With inflation rates falling and economic growth slowing rapidly, 
central banks continued to ease monetary policy.  Since the December Greenbook, th e 
central banks of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea have lowered policy rates by 
100 basis points, 125 basis points, and 150 basis points, respectively.

2 The ASEAN-4 are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. 
In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN-4 ),2 recent data suggest that 
international trade and domestic activity slowed markedly in the fourth quarter.  Business 
and consumer confidence continued to fall in Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.  
Industrial production fell except in Indonesia, which experienced a surprising rebound in 
October.  Exports and imports have also generally contracted across the region in recent 
months, but as in the NIEs, trade balances have not worsened significantly, except in 
Thailand. 
Headline inflation has dropped sharply in recent months, reflecting the fall in commodity 
prices and slowing economic activity.  With this increased room to maneuver, the central 
banks of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand have lowered interest rates since the 
time of the December Greenbook.  In addition, Indonesia introduced a $6.5 billion fiscal 
stimulus package.

In Mexico , economic indicators point to a considerable slowdown of activity in the fourth 
quarter.  Exports contracted sharply, largely reflecting weak U.S. demand, and imports 
also fell, in part because of the sharp depreciation of the peso.  Consumer credit plunged 
28 percent between September and the end of the year.  In November, the unemployment 
rate was nearly 1 percentage point above the third-quarter level, contributing to a steep 
fall in consumer confidence.  Industrial production fell 1 percent in November.  In 
response to the flagging economy, in early January, government officials announced 
additional fiscal stimulus measures targeted toward employment protection, support to 
small and medium-sized companies, and reductions in energy prices. 
Despite weak domestic activity and the fall in global commodity prices, 12-month 
headline and core inflation remain elevated, likely reflecting the pass-through of previous 
increases in food and energy prices as well as the sharp depreciation of the peso against 
the U.S. dollar.  The central bank had been reluctant to loosen monetary policy because 
inflation remains high, but in mid-January, the bank lowered it overnight rate 50 basis 
points.  This was the first change in the rate since August.  In other news, the Bank of 
Mexico’s Governor Guillermo Ortiz was appointed the next chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the Bank for International Settlements.  Governor Ortiz will serve as the 
chairman while completing his term at the Bank of Mexico.

In Brazil , data releases since the December Greenbook paint a gloomy picture for the 
fourth quarter.  Industrial output declined for the second consecutive month in November 
and was down more than 8 percent from its September level.  Production of consumer 
durables was down sharply, led by plummeting output in the auto industry.  Falling 
electricity consumption suggests that production continued to shrink in December.  Both 
exports and imports plunged in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a somewhat smaller 
trade surplus.  As a result of weakening demand, headline inflation declined in December 
to under 6 percent.  
This week, the central bank lowered its target for the overnight interest rate 100 basis 
points, the first move in the target since September.  Longer-maturity Brazilian yields had 
fallen earlier, as weakening domestic and international environments prompted investors 
to view interest rate cuts as increasingly likely. 
In Argentina , indicators for the fourth quarter point to a considerable slowdown of 
economic activity.  Exports declined, reflecting shrinking volumes in some sectors and 
declines in commodity prices.  Industrial production contracted in October and 
November, with automotive production plummeting 24 percent in November from a year 
earlier.  Firms producing base metals cut output by 11 percent and o il refining fell 
12 percent.  In addition, confidence indicators deteriorated, including a plunge in the  
IV-42 
 
 
 
 
manufacturing PMI.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell due to weak domestic 
demand and declines in commodity prices; however, the reliability of the official 
inflation data remains questionable. 
In Venezuela , inflation ended the year above 30 percent, and there are indications that 
activity has slowed considerably in recent months.  Both vehicle production and domestic 
sales were down about 12 percent in the 11 months through November relative to the 
same period a year earlier.  In addition, fiscal revenues have fallen sharply, reflecting the 
fact that over 40 percent of government revenues come from oil sales.  In late December, 
in response to downward pressures on the currency, the government further tightened 
capital controls.  (The bolivar stood at over 5,600 per dollar recently in the black market, 
over twice the official exchange rate.)  In mid-January, Finance Minister Ali Rodriguez 
Araque ruled out devaluation "for now" and indicated that the government would draw 
on its foreign savings to sustain domestic spending.  In February, a referendum will be 
held to reconsider whether to allow a president to have unlimited terms; a similar 
referendum was rejected in December 2007.

 In Russia , third-quarter growth fell to 2¼ percent but remained positive as still-strong 
private consumption more than offset plummeting investment and a continued decline in 
net exports.  The country remains in a financial crisis, with declines in oil and other 
commodity prices a major adverse contributing factor.  Over October and November, 
manufacturing output plunged, and retail trade was down sharply.  The PMI has sunk to 
well below its trough during the 1998 crisis.  Inflation remained high through December, 
with a 12-month increase in consumer prices of over 13 percent, likely fueled by the 
pass-through from the devaluation of the ruble. 
The central bank’s continued stepwise devaluations of the ruble have not alleviated 
downward pressures on the currency.  In part reflecting intervention sales of foreign 
exchange and the provision of dollars to Russian banks and corporations, international 
reserves continued to decline and stood at $396 billion as of January 16, down from a 
peak of $600 billion last summer.  In early December, the central bank raised its short-
term interest rate by 100 basis points to 13 percent.
