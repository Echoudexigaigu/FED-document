1 The emergency unemployment insurance program that began in July has likely boosted labor force 
participation and the unemployment rate by encouraging unemployed individuals to remain in the labor 
force.  The staff estimates that in January and February emergency benefits contributed about 
0.3 percentage point to the level of the published unemployment rate and about 0.2 percentage point to the 
level of the published labor force participation rate. 
II-1 Recent data indicate that economic activity is falling sharply.  The c ontraction is reflected 
in widespread declines in payroll jobs and industrial production.  Consumer spending 
appears to remain low after having changed little, on balance, in recent months.  The 
housing market continues on a steep descent,  and nonresidential co nstruction has begun 
to decline in earnest.  Business spending on equipment and software continues to fall 
across a broad range of categ ories.  Despite the cutb acks in production, inventory 
overhangs have worsened in a number of areas .  Both headline and core consumer price 
inflation remained subdued in January. 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor market conditions have continued to de teriorate at a rapid rate.  Private payroll 
employment plunged an average of 670,000 pe r month over the past three months.  
Employment losses remain widespread acro ss industries with the notable exception of 
health care.  Altogether, private payroll em ployment has declined nearly 3 million since 
October and 4½ million since the recession bega n.  Meanwhile, the average workweek of 
production and nonsupervisory workers on privat e payrolls remained low at 33.3 hours in 
February, and the aggregate hours for this gr oup stood about 8 percent (at an annual rate) 
below the fourth-quarter average. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  climbed ½ percentage point in February 
to 8.1 percent.  The unemployment rate has now increased 1½ percentage points since 
October and 3¼ percentage points since the recession began.  The labor force 
participation rate, which had remained relativ ely stable during the first half of 2008, has 
moved down about ½ percentage point since th en in response to weakening labor demand 
and stood at 65.6 percent in February.1 
Other indicators also suggest a continued de terioration of the labor market.  Weekly 
initial unemployment insurance claims moved up rapidly over  the past two months, as 
has the number of individuals who receive unemployment insurance benefits.  Other 
indicators of involuntary job separations—short-term job lose rs in the household survey,

3 These productivity estimates reflect the benchmar k revision recently made by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics to nonfarm payroll employment as well as subsequent additional data on hours and output in the 
fourth quarter. the layoff and discharge rate in the JOLTS, and announcements of job cuts reported by 
Challenger, Gray, and Christmas,  Inc.—have continued to climb.2  Hiring rates as 
measured in the JOLTS remain low, and hiring plans as measured in the NFIB survey and 
the Manpower survey (not shown) have weakened further.  Measures of job vacancy 
rates—job openings in the JOLTS and the Help Wanted Index—have continued to drop, and alternative measures of labor market slack—job availability as reported in the 
Conference Board survey and hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey—have also worsened so far this year.  Not surprisingly, measures of households’ expectations of future labor market conditions remain depressed. 
With output now reported to have dropped sh arply in the fourth quarter, the staff 
estimates that output per hour in  the nonfarm business sector dec lined at an annual rate of 
0.9 percent after fairly solid gains earlier in the year.  Over the four quarters of 2008, 
productivity increased 2.1 percent, about 0.5 pe rcentage point lower than the increase in 
2007.

decline to 10 percent.  Available indicators of produc tion for February (including 
production worker hours) suggest another sizable drop last mont h.  The declines in output 
remain exceptionally widespread across indus tries; the diffusion index of three-month 
changes in total IP moved down in January to a 34-year low.  In manufacturing, declines 
in output averaged about 2½ percent each m onth from November to January, and the 
factory operating rate fell to 68 percent in Janu ary, the historical low for a series that goes 
back to 1948.4 
Production of light motor vehicles tumbled to  an average annual rate of only 4.1 million 
units in January and February, about 3 million units below the pace in the fourth quarter, 
as manufacturers have responde d to the rapid deterioration in demand over the past few 
months.  Stocks of domestic light vehicles declined sharpl y in January and February, but 
days’ supply of light vehicles has remained  at a high level of around 100 days since the 
fourth quarter.  Looking ahead, industry production schedules call for the pace of 
assemblies to rise moderately in March and the second quarter. 
Elsewhere in transportation, ne w orders at Boeing for comm ercial aircraft have moved 
down in recent months.5   
.6  Moreover, airlines are requesting the 
deferral of aircraft orders in the face of weak demand for air travel.7  Nevertheless, 
Boeing has a large backlog of or ders that should continue to provide a buffer against a 
significant downturn in aircraft production and deliveries, at least in the near term.    
The output of high-technology products declin ed 3¼ percent in January.  Semiconductor 
production fell more than 7 percent, with out put of microprocessors and some types of 
flash memory chips particularly hard hit.  Computer production declined 3½ percent, 
with demand reported to be weakening for bot h business and personal computers.  Output  
                                                 
4 On February 18, the Federal Reserve published its  preliminary estimates of industrial capacity for 
2009.  Measured fourth quarter to fourth quarter, manu facturing capacity is estima ted to decline 0.6 percent 
in 2009 after having risen 1.7 percent last year.  Thes e estimates will be updated with the annual revision to 
industrial production and capacity that will be published on March 27.

7 According to industry reports, more than 11 perc ent of the global air transport fleet is currently 
“parked” in the desert airfields of California and Ariz ona, with U.S. airlines disproportionately represented 
in those airfields.  For comparison, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, roughly 13 percent of global 
airline capacity was similarly parked.

in most subcategories of communications equipment fell in January; however, output for 
the communications sector as a whole rose 1½ percent as these declines were more than 
offset by a large increase in the output of  the “satellite and earth station” industry. 
Looking ahead, available indicators point to  a further weakening in high-tech output 
through much of 2009.  In a survey by the National Association of Business Economists, responses to a question on longer-term high-tech spendi ng plans suggest widespread 
weakness this year.  For semiconductors, consul tancies such as Gart ner, Instat, and IDC 
lowered their global shipments forecasts in Febr uary to a level that is consistent with a 
sharp decline in semiconductor pr oduction in the first half of  the year.  Data from the 
Institute for Printed Circuits point to a sh arp drop in demand from the broad electronics 
sector for circuit boards and other high -tech equipment.  In the communication 
equipment sector, major providers of tele communications services  announced plans to 
significantly lower their capit al expenditure in 2009.  
Outside of the energy, motor vehicles and part s, aircraft and parts, and high-technology 
industries, production (amounting to about 62 percent of total IP) decreased 1½ percent 
in January with declines in all major market groups except defense and space equipment.  The production of consumer durables and busin ess equipment was particularly weak, and 
the index for construction supplies plunged 3½ percent to a level 17 percent below its 
year-earlier reading.  In addition, the out put of materials fe ll 1½ percent, with 
pronounced declines in most dur able materials categories. 
Broad indicators of near-term manufacturing activity suggest  that factor y output will 
continue to fall steeply over the next few m onths.  The new orders diffusion indexes from 
the Institute for Supply Management’s nationa l survey and from the regional surveys are 
at exceptionally low levels.  The three-month moving average of the staff’s series on real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude  industries for which reported orders have 
little information content for predicting ship ments) fell 3¼ percent in January and is 
consistent with substantial output losses in the coming months.  Fina lly, an indicator of 
foreign economic activity (a trade-weighted av erage of the IP indexes for some of the 
United States’ major trading partners) sugge sts that foreign demand, which had helped 
support IP for much of the past year, has plunged as well. 
Motor Vehicles 
Demand for new automobiles and light trucks tu mbled early this year, as the pace of sales 
dropped to an annual rate of 9.5 million units in January and 9.1 million units in February 
from an already depressed fourth-quarter leve l.

.  The fall in 
retail sales since mi
d-2008 has come
 as the la bor market deteriorat ed, household wealth 
declined, financing conditions tightened, and consumers expressed more anxiety over the 
economic outlook. 
Incentives fell back a bit in February and early March but remained high, and the terms 
on auto loans appear to have improved.  As a result, consumers raised their assessment of 
car-buying conditions in the Reuters/Universi ty of Michigan survey in January and 
February.  However, with many of the othe r determinants of vehicle demand stuck at 
abysmal levels, the effectiveness of the in centives and improved financing appears to 
have been limited. 
Consumer Spending  
After having fallen sharply over the second half  of last year, the available data suggest 
that total consumer spending held steady, on balan ce, in the first two months of this year.  
The latest retail sales data, together with th e staff’s projection for PCE prices, imply that 
real spending on goods excluding motor vehi cles moved up 1¼ percent in January and 
¼ percent in February.  In contrast, real outlays on motor vehicles shrank further in 
February after holding steady at low levels in the previous three months.  Spending on 
services moved up in January, but a sizable  rise in energy services accounted for 
essentially all of the increase. 
The financial strain on households intensified over the past several months.  By the end 
of the fourth quarter, household net worth had fa llen to less than five years of disposable 
income for the first time since 1995, and substa ntial declines in equity and house prices 
have continued early this year. Private wages and salaries continued to cont ract in January.  Howe ver, special factors 
boosted personal disposable income in January  and pushed the persona l saving rate up to 
5 percent.  Cost-of-living adjustments, refl ecting the sharp rise in the CPI last year, 
boosted transfer payments, while the Bureau of Economic Analysis lowered its estimate 
of net tax payments under the assumption that siza ble capital losses realized last year 
would reduce final settlements (April  payments less refunds) this year.
8  Given the sharp 
decline in employment, private wages and sa laries likely fell further in February.  
                                                 
8 The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits is based on the four-quarter change in the CPI 
for urban wage earners through the third quarter of the previous year.  This year’s increase of 5.8 percent 

II-16 
Consumer sentiment fell again last month as households voiced greater concerns about 
income and job prospects; in particular, expectations for the comi ng year deteriorated 
sharply despite the passage of  the economic stimulus package.  The Reuters/Michigan 
index now stands only slightly above its 29-year low reached in November, and the 
Conference Board index, which includes dire ct questions about em ployment conditions, 
has fallen to its lowest level since the series began in 1967.  
Housing  
The descent in housing activity has steepened  further recently.  Single-family housing 
starts dropped another 12 pe rcent in January, and permit issuance—a useful month-ahead 
indicator of starts—also continued to fall.  In the multifamily sector—where activity had 
held relatively steady through mid-2008—starts plunged 28 percent in January after large 
drops in each of the previous three months.  Industry sources high light the unavailability 
of construction credit in explaining the recen t downturn in this sector.  The long lag 
between when builders obtain financing for multifamily projects and when construction 
begins implies that the tightening of cred it for commercial construction loans over the 
past year may have only just begun to seriously impair activity. 
Housing demand remains very weak, likely re flecting the deteriora tion in employment 
and income prospects and expectations of fu rther declines in house prices.  The Census 
Bureau’s measure of new single-family home sales dropped another 10 percent in January to a level 48 percent below its year-ear lier level.   
 
.  Although the stock of unsold new single-family homes fell in January to 
its lowest level since 2003, inventories continue d to move up relative to the weak pace of 
sales. 
Sales of existing single-family homes fell 5 percent in January to an annual rate of just 
more than 4 million units, reversing the uptick seen in December.  Existing home sales 
currently stand 7 percent below their year-earlier leve l, a much smaller decline than in  
                                                                                                                                                 
was the largest since the early 1980s.  Government sala ries also increased in response to inflation in the 
previous year.

9 Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate agents, many 
foreclosure-related sales are included in the statis tics on existing home sales because banks frequently hire 
real estate agents to sell repossessed properties. 
10 Unlike the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s index (formerly known as the OFHEO index, 
calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterp rise Oversight), the LoanPerformance (LP) index 
includes both conforming and nonconforming loans.  In addition, the LP index has better geographic 
coverage than the S&P/Case-Shiller (CS) index.  Th e LP and CS indexes showed similar movements from 
2002 to 2007, but more recently the LP index has declined less than the CS index. new home sales.  The comparative strength in existing home sales is partly attributable to 
increases in foreclosure-relate d and other distressed sales.9 
Sales remain weak despite historically low mortgage rates for borrowers eligible for conforming loans.  After having fallen sharply late last year, rates for conforming 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages have fluctuated in a re latively narrow range so far this year.  In 
contrast, the market for nonconforming loans (t hat is, loans that cannot be purchased by 
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) remains severely  impaired.  Rates on jumbo loans continue 
to be elevated, and the priv ate nonprime market remains cl osed.  Although the FHA has 
offered an alternative source of mortgage fi nancing for some higher-risk borrowers, the 
FHA’s relatively strict lending standards and higher costs suggest that such lending is 
likely to have replaced only a part of the reduction in credit from other sources. 
House prices remain on a downward trajectory.  The repeat-sales pr ice index for existing 
single-family homes calculated by LoanPerforma nce—a recently developed index that is 
more representative than the Federal Hous ing Finance Agency and S&P/Case-Shiller 
indexes—fell 12 percent over the 12 months e nding in January, a slightly greater decline 
than over the previous 12-month period.

Equipment and Software 
Toward the end of last year, real invest ment in E&S began a sharp and broad-based 
decline, which shows no sign of abating.  Business spending on transportation equipment 
has continued to fall from already extremel y low levels, and demand both for high-tech 
E&S and for equipment other than high-tech and transportation plum meted in the fourth 
quarter.  More recently, nominal shipme nts of nondefense capital goods excluding 
aircraft dropped 6¾ percent in January, and orders fell sharply further to remain well 
below shipments.  These data point to another large drop in spending in the current 
quarter. 
Business outlays on transportation equipment, which had already fallen by the end of last 
year to about one-third of their peak level, co ntinue to decline this quarter.  Deliveries of

light vehicles to rental car companies dropped steeply, on balance, in January and 
February, and demand for light vehicles from other businesse s has softened since the end 
of the year.  Sales of medium and heavy truc ks also weakened in January and February, 
and new orders, which fell sharply in January, suggest sales are likely to slow further in 
the near term.  In contrast, data on airc raft shipments through January and on Boeing 
deliveries through February point to a firs t-quarter advance in domestic aircraft 
investment. 
Real spending by businesses on high-tech E&S fe ll at an extraordinarily rapid pace in the 
fourth quarter of last year, posting a decline that was even faster (in percentage terms) 
than the worst of the tech collapse in 2001.  Shipments and IP of computers and 
peripherals stepped down again in January, a de crease consistent with further declines in 
spending this quarter.  Cisco expects revenue this quarter to  be 15 percent to 20 percent 
below year-earlier levels, an indicati on of continued weakness in demand for 
communications equipment. 
The fundamental determinants of E&S spendi ng have worsened appr eciably:  Business 
output has dropped, and surging bon d yields led to an upward sp ike in the user cost of 
capital in the fourth quarter.  More forward-looking indicat ors remain grim.  Corporate 
bond spreads over Treasury securities are extrem ely elevated, and businesses report to the 
NFIB that the supply of credit was quite  restricted through February.  Meanwhile, 
readings of business conditions from both regional and nationa l purchasing manager 
surveys have been stuck at depressed levels , and indexes of capital spending plans from 
various surveys remain low. 
Nonresidential construction 
After holding up surprisingly well through most  of last year, the spending data for 
nonresidential structures are now  beginning to show declines consistent with the dismal 
fundamentals for this sector.  Nominal c onstruction expenditures on nonresidential 
buildings (that is, structures other than those for drilling and mining) fell 4 percent in 
January.  In real terms, investment declined for most types of buildi ngs over the past few 
months; even expenditures in the power s ector, which had supporte d total nonresidential 
investment during most of 2008, dropped sharpl y in January.  One exception is spending 
related to petroleum refining;  however, trade reports have indicated that some already-
begun renovations of petroleum refineries have been canceled or delayed recently, resulting, in part, from the plunge in energy prices in the second half of last year.

11 Interpreting the book-value inventory data is difficult when prices display large movements.  For 
example, the decline in bo ok-value inventories in the fourth quarter was exceptionally large, reflecting not 
only modest real drawdowns but also the revaluation of existing stocks at much lower prices.   
12 The FRB staff’s flow-of-goods system measures changes in inventories by tracking the flow of goods in 
the economy.  The system divides the output from the staff’s IP indexes into more than 60 different product 
categories.  For each product category, the system es timates the supply of goods flowing into the economy–
that is, domestic production plus imports.  The system then estimates how much of the supply flows out, 
whether as final demand, including exports, or as inputs for other goods.  The difference between the 
amount flowing in and the amount flowing out is the change in inventories.  
 Falling energy prices have also  curtailed investment in dr illing and mining structures.  
Real spending on these structures flattened out  in the fourth quarter of 2008 after eight 
years of substantial increases, and the late st data on drilling activity suggest that 
investment in this sector dr opped steeply early this year. 
Outside of energy-related construction, the fundamentals of nonresidential investment 
have deteriorated further.  Vacancy rates continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter 
of 2008, and the January Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
suggested that financing for new construction projects has be come even more difficult to 
obtain.  In addition, the archit ectural billings index continued to fall in January and 
declines in nonresidential constr uction employment have steepened. 
Business Inventories  
Census data on book-value invent ory investm
ent for January suggest that firms further 
pared their stocks early this quarter.11  However, sales have con tinued to fall more quickly 
than inventories, which has exacerbated the ove rhangs that developed in the second half 
of 2008.  The run-up in ratios of inventories to sales th rough January was widespread 
across categories but was particularly sharp for durable goods.  The staff’s flow-of-goods 
system also shows a deteriorating inventory picture.12  Stocks appear particularly elevated 
relative to demand for business equipment, cons truction supplies, and materials.  Finally, 
the Institute for Supply Management’s index of customers’ inventories in the early part of 
this year indicated that a majority of res pondents were concerned th at inventory positions 
are too high.

II-26 
After excluding financial tran sactions (mainly those associ ated with the TARP and the 
conservatorship of the housi ng-related government-sponsored enterprises) and adjusting 
for payment-timing shifts, federal outlays in January and February were almost 6 percent 
above those in the same period a year earlie r.  Outlays for income security programs 
posted robust increases over the year-earlier period, as spending on unemployment 
insurance benefits, supplemental security income benefits, and food stamps rose 
noticeably.  Spending for federal health prog rams and Social Security also showed 
sizable gains over the levels  of a year earlier.   
In contrast, federal receipts in the January-February period were roughly 16 percent lower than in the same period last year.  Re lative to the year-earli er period, personal tax 
payments fell almost 15 percent, likely reflec ting weak income and a drop in realized 
capital gains.  Refunds on 2008 individual tax li ability were also significantly higher than 
in the same period last year.  Information from the Treasury suggests that most of the 
surge in refunds reflects a higher average ref und per filer rather than  an acceleration in 
the timing of tax filing. 
The recently enacted economic stimulus package—the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act—includes tax reductions  and spending increases amounting to 
$787 billion over the next 11 years (details about the legislation are reported in the 
appendix to this section).  In its recently released budget, the Admi nistration expects the 
deficit in fiscal year 2009 to total $1. 8 trillion—12¼ percent of  GDP.  Under the 
President’s proposals, the deficit is projec ted to be about 7 percent of GDP in the 
following two years and then move down to level out at about 3 percent of GDP. 
State and Local Government Sector  
Real spending by state and local governments turned down sharply in the fourth quarter 
as budgetary pressures intensifie d and apparently has continued to fall in the first quarter. 
Real construction expenditures by state and lo cal governments moved down in the fourth 
quarter and plunged further in January.  Meanwh ile, employment in this sector was flat in 
the second half of 2008, a pronounced step-dow n from the fairly robust gains of 22,000 
per month in the first half of the year.  So far in 2009, however, employment in this 
sector appears to have rebounded a bit, risi ng an average of 12,000 per month in January 
and February. 
The fiscal conditions of state governments have deteriorated appr eciably as revenues 
have continued to decline.  The National Conference of State Le gislatures (NCSL) 
reported that as of January, states collectivel y estimated that (without accounting for the

13 Most notably, California recently dealt with its extraordinarily severe budget crisis through a 
combination of spending cuts (including a two-day-per-month mandatory furlough of all state government 
employees) and tax increases. federal fiscal stimulus package) they f aced a $50 billion budget shortfall for the 2009 
fiscal year.  Furthermore, according to the NCSL, states expected to face an $85 billion 
budget shortfall in fiscal 2010.  Many states are in the process of a ddressing their budget 
problems, primarily by reducing expenditures,  drawing down rainy day funds, and, to a 
lesser extent, raising taxes.13  More importantly, grants in  the federal stimulus package 
will help shore up state budgets.   
Prices  
Overall consumer prices increased in January af ter posting sizable declines late last year.  
Led by an increase in energy prices, total PCE prices m oved up 0.2 percent in January 
after averaging declines of 0.7 percent per month over the last three months of 2008.  
Excluding food and energy, PCE prices increas ed 0.1 percent in January after being 
essentially unchanged in the previous thr ee months.  Taking a longer view, core PCE 
prices rose 1½ percent over the 12 months  ending in January, down from a 2¼ percent 
increase over the previous 12 months; the 12- month change in total PCE prices slowed 
from 3½ percent to ¾ percent over the same  period.  As headline inflation has come 
down, survey-based measures of near-term infl ation expectations have receded; however, 
indicators of longer-term expect ations have been steadier.   
After posting dramatic declines in the previous  five months, consumer energy prices rose 
1¾ percent in January, largely reflecting an incr ease in gasoline pric es.  Survey results 
suggest that retail gasoline prices increased further in  February but have ticked down 
since then.  The increase in ga soline prices so far this year  reflects both some recovery in 
prices for WTI crude oil and a rebound in  margins since the end of last year. 
Consumer food prices continued to moderate  in the beginning of  2009, rising 0.1 percent 
in January for a second consecutive month, as la st autumn’s declines in farm prices have 
begun to show through to the retail level.  Over the three months ending in January, food 
prices have increased at an annual rate of  2½ percent—down from a 7 percent rate of 
increase over the previous three months but st ill higher than the rate  of change of core 
consumer prices.  After their sharp decline last fall, spot prices for corn, wheat, and 
soybeans now appear to ha ve stabilized around their mid-2007 levels and remain 
considerably higher than the av erage over the preceding decade.

Core PCE prices edged up 0.1 percent in Ja nuary, pushed up by increases in prices for 
core goods, especially apparel and motor ve hicles.  The January uptick in core goods 
prices follows a decline over the previous three months, which wa s associated with 
aggressive discounting in reaction to weak demand, excess inventories, and lessening 
cost pressures.  
Broader measures of inflation have also st epped down from the leve ls observed over the 
past few years.  In 2008, the GDP price inde x rose 2 percent, dow n ½ percentage point 
from the increase over 2007.  The deceleration in the GDP price index, however, is 
markedly smaller than the decelerations in the price indexes for overall PCE and gross domestic purchases, reflecting the fact that the steep declin e in the price of imported oil 
does not directly affect the price index for domestically produced  goods and services.  
The low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in re cent months have no 
doubt contributed to the decline in near-term inflation expectations from their high levels 
in mid-2008.  In contrast, measures of longer-t erm expectations have remained close to 
their average over the past couple of y ears.  Median one-year-ahead inflation 
expectations in the Reuters/Michigan su rvey hovered around 2 percent in January and 
February, down from around 5 percent last su mmer; the median expectation for inflation 
over the next 5 to 10 years rose to 3.1 pe rcent in February, up from January and 
December but close to the average over 2008.  Furthermore, according to the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, expected PCE infla tion over the next 10 years held steady at 
2.2 percent in the first quar ter of 2009, while expected CP I inflation over the next 
10 years edged down 0.1 percentage point, to 2.4 percent.  As discussed in the “Domestic 
Financial Developments” section, liquidity c onditions are still quite poor in the market 
for TIPS, making it difficult to infer infla tion expectations from TIPS-based measures. 
Prices at earlier stages of pr ocessing have retreated considerab ly after a rapid rise in the 
first half of last year.  The PPI for core  intermediate materials dropped 1 percent in 
January after decreasing 2¼ per cent, on average, in each of the previous three months.  
This pattern reflects, in part , weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a 
wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such  as chemicals and plastics.  Meanwhile, 
since the January Greenbook, commodity pr ices have stepped down after moving up 
somewhat in the first few weeks of this year.   
Labor Costs 
Hourly compensation has continued to increase  moderately.  The employment cost index 
for hourly compensation of private-industry work ers rose at an annual rate of only about

2 percent over the three months ending in  December, and the 12-month change, at 
2½ percent, is ½ percentage point below th e increase in 2007.  This deceleration was 
evident in both the wages and salaries and the benefits components of the index. 
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business s ector rose more rapidly in the second 
half of 2008 than in the first half, but the in crease for the year as a whole, at 4 percent, 
was similar to the increases over the preceding few years.  Despite a solid gain in labor 
productivity, unit labor costs rose a moderate  2 percent in 2008.  More recently, average 
hourly earnings for production and nonsuperv isory workers increased 0.2 percent per 
month in January and February.  This measure of wages has rise n 3½ percent over the 
past 12 months, down slightly from the increase over the previous 12 months.

14 The homebuyer tax credit does not require repayment if the home is purchased in 2009; however, 
those that used it in 2008 are still required to pay it back. American Recovery and Re investment Act of 2009 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 was passed by the Congress and 
signed by the President in February.  As shown in  the table, the fiscal stimulus package is 
estimated to increase the federal defic it by $787 billion from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 
2019, with $283 billion of the budget cost attr ibutable to tax cuts and $504 billion 
attributable to increased spe nding.  Almost three-fourths of the total budget costs of the 
package are expected to aris e in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. 
Individual Tax Cuts 
The largest component of the tax relief for individuals is a $400 “Making Work Pay” tax 
credit.  This tax cut is antici pated to show up primarily in lower tax withholding this year 
and next and also to be partially reflected in higher refunds duri ng the filing season after 
the end of the tax year.  The individual tax cuts also include the cost of providing relief 
for most households from the alternative mi nimum tax in 2009.  In addition, the package 
raises the earned income ta x credit and the child tax cred it over the next two years, 
increases the first-time homebuyer credit put  in place last year from $7,500 to $8,000 and 
extends it through November 2009, and allows the sales tax associated with light vehicle 
purchases to be tax de ductible this year.14 
Business Tax Cuts The business tax cuts include  the extension through 2009 of the 50 percent bonus (or 
accelerated) depreciation allowance for equipmen t spending that was instituted last year; 
this provision is estimated to  reduce business tax payments in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 
but is expected to raise revenues in the following years as firms subsequently have lower 
depreciation deductions after taking the tem porary bonus allowance.  The package also 
contains numerous other tax provisions for businesses, including the deferral this year 
and next of taxable income arising from the discharge of firms’ debt; this income will 
eventually be included in taxable income  and increase revenues in later years. 
Transfer Payments 
The stimulus package increases transfer payments through several programs, including 
those that (1) boost unemploym ent insurance benefits both by extending eligibility for 
emergency unemployment compensation through the end of this year and by temporarily 
increasing the weekly unemployment benefit by $25; (2) temporarily  increase benefits 
under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistan ce Program (formerly known as the Food

15 The state fiscal stabilization funds, administered by  the Department of Education, will be distributed 
to the states based on population.  Eighty percent of these funds must be disbursed by the states to school 
districts based on existing aid formulas, and the remaining 20 percent can be used at the states’ discretion.  These funds must be used by the end of the 2011 fiscal year (Sept. 30, 2011).  A small portion of the funds 
are reserved for incentive grants to be given to states  on a competitive basis in fiscal 2010, based on states 
meeting specified criteria on how they spent their initial allocations. Stamp Program); (3) provide a one-time $250 paym ent to recipients of  Social Security 
and veterans benefits, which is  expected to be distributed in the spring; (4) establish a 
new program to subsidize health insurance pr emiums to assist people who have become 
unemployed in continuing the health cove rage they previously  had through their 
employer; and (5) increase the funding for Pell Grants and other student financial 
assistance. 
Federal Grants to State Governments 
The stimulus package provides a temporary but significant increase in federal grants to 
state governments.  In particular, the legislati on provides fiscal stabi lization grants to the 
states—funds that are intended for educati on and other general government activities.15  
Also, the stimulus package provides budget relie f for the states by temporarily increasing 
the federal match rate for states’ Medicaid  costs through the end of 2010.  Finally, the 
package includes grants specifically for education programs and school renovation, along 
with other grants for highways, bridges, se wers, and various infr astructure projects. 
Federal Purchases 
The stimulus package provides additional budget authority for a number of federal 
spending programs, including funds for the Army Corps of Engineers, military construction, and other infrastructure proj ects, along with severa l research programs. 
Subsidies 
The stimulus package provides funds for severa l long-term projects, including those that 
extend access to broadband Inte rnet services, expand the use of health information 
technology by doctors and hospitals, and improve  a number of energy-related programs.  
Only a very small portion of the spending asso ciated with these programs is expected to 
be made over the next two years.

Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets
Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1  
  
 Overview 
Although functioning in a few financial ma rkets showed some limited signs of 
improvement over the intermeeting period, fina ncial conditions overall appeared to 
become even less supportive of economic activ ity.  Broad equity-price indexes tumbled, 
and some longer-term corporate risk spr eads widened on incoming data suggesting a 
weaker-than-expected economic outlook a nd market concerns about the likely 
effectiveness of government stimulus program s.  Asset prices of banking organizations 
were particularly hard hit, and Call Repor t data showed furthe r declines in bank 
profitability, credit quality, and lending commit ments in the fourth quarter.  In shorter-
term funding markets, changes in risk spr eads were mixed.  Corporate debt growth has 
held up, supported by strong bond issuance by hi ghly rated firms, while the latest 
indicators point to continued weakness in household borrowing.   
Financial Institutions Share prices of banking organizations droppe d sharply and CDS spreads on senior and 
subordinated bank debt jumped, on net, over the intermeeting period.  On February 10, 
the U.S. government announced a broad set of measures to strengthen financial institutions and to increase the availability of credit to  households and businesses.  
However, market participants were reporte dly disappointed with the lack of detail 
regarding important elements of the new Fina ncial Stability Plan.  Concerns about the 
potential nationalization of two large ba nking institutions also weighed on market 
sentiment, as did the barrage of weaker-than-expected economic data releases.  
Stock prices of insurance companies dropped sharply over the period, reflecting concerns 
about the adequacy of their capital positions .  On March 2, AIG reported losses of more 
than $60 billion for the fourth quarter of last year, and the Treasury Department and the 
Federal Reserve announced a restructuring of the government assistance to AIG to 
enhance the company’s capital a nd liquidity to facilitate th e orderly completion of its 
global divestiture program.      
Short-Term Funding Markets 
Changes in conditions in short-term fundi ng markets were mixed over the intermeeting 
period.  In interbank markets, spreads of Libor relative to OIS rates edged up.  In 
contrast, spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper continued to trend down over the 
intermeeting period, and spreads on AA-rated as set-backed commercial paper remained 
at the lower end of their range  over the past year.  In markets for repurchase agreements 
(repos), bid-asked spreads on most collateral na rrowed, and “haircuts” declined a bit on

1 A large quantity of MBS purchases is slated to settle at close of business on Thursday, March 12, as 
are the loans awarded through the March 9 Term Auction Facility auction.  After the settlements, the level 
of total Federal Reserve assets should be a bit higher than that at the time of the last FOMC meeting. repos collateralized by agency debt, CM BS, and some private-label MBS, though 
volumes remained low.   
Federal Reserve Facilities and Purchase Programs 
The level of total Federal Reserve assets ha s changed little, on ne t, since the January 
FOMC meeting.1  Primary credit was about flat, a nd credit outstanding under the Term 
Auction Facility (TAF) increased somewhat over the period as the February auctions 
experienced higher demand than previous auctions.  In contrast, credit extended under the 
Primary Dealer Credit Facility  declined somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Credit 
outstanding under the Asset-B acked Commercial Paper M oney Market Mutual Fund 
Liquidity Facility edged closer  to zero, and credit extende d under the Commercial Paper 
Funding Facility (CPFF) dropped roughly $100 billion to about $240 billion over the 
period.  At the end of January, about $240 billion of commercial paper that was 
purchased in late October unde r the CPFF matured.  Several fi nancial issuers that paid 
down paper from the CPFF substituted toward longer-term funding alternatives, including debt issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program established by 
the FDIC.  
Since the January FOMC meeting, the Federa l Reserve has purchased about $15 billion 
in agency debt and about $150 billion in agency MBS, including opera tions in the dollar 
roll market.  Federal Reserve purchases of MB S absorbed the bulk of new MBS issuance.  
The System conducted several Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions, all of 
which were undersubscribed.  A $50 billion TSLF Options Program auction covering 
quarter-end was conducted March 3 and was al so undersubscribed, despite a reduction in 
the fee for the associated TSLF draws. On March 3, the Treasury Department a nd the Federal Reserve Board announced the 
launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  In the program’s 
initial phase, the Federal Reserve will le nd up to a total of $200 billion to U.S. 
companies, collateralized by eligible AAA-rated ABS backed by recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, a nd small business loans guaranteed by the Small 
Business Administration.  Subscriptions for funding in March will be accepted on March 
17, and the first funds from the program will be disbursed on March 25.  The program 
will hold monthly fundings through December 2 009, or longer if the Federal Reserve

 chooses to extend the facility.  The Federa l Reserve and the Treasury Department have 
also announced plans to expand the facility in the future to accept CMBS and to explore 
the possibility of accepting other types of AAA-rated newly issued ABS, which could 
generate up to $1 trillion in new lending. 
Policy Expectations and Interest Rates 
The expected path of the federal funds rate was little changed, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, despite the deteriorati on in the economic outlook.  The decision by 
the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the January 
FOMC meeting and subsequent monetary policy communications were in line with 
market expectations and elicite d very little reaction in futures rates.  Market and survey-
based measures of policy expectations indicate that investors expect the federal funds rate 
to trade within the current ta rget range at least through the third quarter of this year.  
None of the respondents to the survey of primary dealers exp ect the funds rate to rise 
before the first half of 2010, and the majority  of respondents expect the first increase to 
occur in the first half  of 2011 or later.   
Over the intermeeting period, yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities 
increased about 30 basis points, at least in part in response to a massive increase in the 
expected supply of these securities.  Yiel ds on longer-horizon TIPS increased more than 
their nominal counterparts, leaving 5-to-10- year-ahead inflation compensation about  
40 basis points lower on net.  Inflation compen sation for the next five years fell slightly. 
Poor liquidity conditions in the TIPS market c ontinued to make these readings difficult to 
interpret.  Longer-term inflation expectations from surveys were mixed, with the 
Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters showing a small decline and the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showing an increase.      
Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads 
Broad equity-price indexes decreased about  15 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, as investors revised down their outlook for the economy  and concerns intensified 
about the health of major financial institutio ns.  The spread between the forward trend 
earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real long-run Treasury 
yield—a rough measure of the equity premium—was little cha nged, remaining at a very

2 We have revised the method by which we calculate the trend earnings series.  We now make use of 
information in equity analysts’ earnings expectations up to 24 months ahead; previously, we only used 
information on analysts’ expectations for earnings 12 months ahead.  We also incorporated information about dividends and earnings over the previous 12 months.  Under the new methodology, the equity 
premium is estimated to be about 2 percentage points lower in recent months than under the previous 
methodology but is still at the highest level in the 25-year history of the series.  high level.2  Options-implied volatility on the S& P 500 index was little changed over the 
intermeeting period. 
 On net, yields on BBB-rated and high-yie ld corporate bonds increased about 25 and 
100 basis points, respectivel y, over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of yields on BBB-
rated corporate bonds relative to those on co mparable-maturity Treasuries were little 
changed, while spreads on high-yield bonds increased about 70 basis poi nts.  Measures of 
liquidity in the secondary market for hi gh-yield corporate bonds worsened over the 
intermeeting period, while those for investment -grade bonds were little changed; for both 
segments of the market, liquidity remains re latively poor by historical standards.     
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 fi rms in the fourth quarter were about 
65 percent below year-earlier levels, with  nonfinancial sector earnings down about 
20 percent and the financial sector posting a substantial loss in aggregate.  Analysts’ 
forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were revised down dramatically in 
the month ending in mid-February, with substantial markdowns in the financial and 
nonfinancial sectors. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms has de teriorated further over the past few months.  
The pace of nonfinancial corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s in January was 
somewhat below its fourth-quarter level, which was the highest since 2002.  Expected 
year-ahead defaults estimated by Moody’s KM V continued to shoot up in February on 
falling asset valuations.  The delinquency rate on C&I loan s increased notably in the 
fourth quarter, and the six-month trailing bond default rate climbed higher in February.  
Business Finance 
Net debt financing by nonfinanci al corporations has held up fa irly well over the first two 
months of this year owing to strong corporate bond issuance amid a narrowing of yield 
spreads in the first several weeks of the y ear.  Investment-grade issuance more than 
doubled the already solid pace seen in the f ourth quarter as top-grade firms evidently 
decided to strengthen their ba lance sheets by shifting toward  longer-term debts.  In

 contrast, speculative-grade issuance remained very sluggish, although it picked up from a 
near-zero level late last year .  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding bumped up in 
January but dropped in February.  C&I loans contracted markedly, on net, over January 
and February with widespread paydowns.  
 In terms of equity issuance, both ini tial and seasoned offerings by nonfinancial 
corporations remained weak in January and February.  In the fourth quarter, equity 
retirements from share repurchases are esti mated to have slowed substantially, while 
retirements from cash-financed mergers were little changed at modera te levels.  All told, 
net equity issuance posted its smallest quarterly decline in more than five years.  So far 
this year, a handful of large mergers have been announced, but announcements of new 
share repurchase programs have been scant. 
Financial firms continued to issue a substantia l volume of bonds in January and February 
under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarante e Program.  In contrast, such firms have 
issued almost no equity this year. 
Commercial Real Estate 
The growth of commercial mortgage debt wa s anemic in the fourth quarter, damped by 
both weak fundamentals and difficult financ ing conditions for new construction and the 
acquisition of existing properties.  The volume of sales continued to drop in February, 
and price declines accelerated in the fourth quarter.  The delinquency rate on commercial 
mortgages held by banks rose in the fourth quarter to the highest level since 1994, mainly 
reflecting a further deterioration in the pe rformance of residential and commercial 
construction loans.  The delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held in CMBS has 
moved up sharply over the past several months, driven by both deteriorating 
fundamentals and the inability of borrowers to  find refinancing for balloon payments on 
maturing loans.  Moody’s Investor Service issu ed downgrades for a large swath of junior 
AAA tranches of CMBS, but senior AAA tranches experi enced few downgrades.    
Household Finance Over the intermeeting period, in terest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages fluctuated 
in a relatively narrow band and were lit tle changed on net.  Rates offered on 
nonconforming jumbo loans continued to r un significantly higher than those on 
conforming loans.  The gap between rates on conforming mortgages and yields on MBS 
backed by such mortgages narrowed about 30 basis points, and the sp read to Treasury 
rates of fixed-rate conforming mortgages also  narrowed significantly.  However, these

    spreads remain high by historical standard s amid diminished capacity at mortgage 
originators, increased hedging costs, and hi gher fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac. 
Issuance of MBS by the housing GSEs continue d at a relatively modest pace in January, 
and the non-agency market remained shut.  Total home mortgage debt outstanding 
declined again in the fourth quarter and has now fallen in each of the past three quarters. 
National house price indexes have fallen furt her, with the LoanPerformance price index 
posting a decline of 11 percent over the year en ding in January.  Declining home prices, a 
tight supply of mortgage credit, and th e slowing economy have continued to push up 
mortgage delinquency rates.  About 4 percen t of prime mortgages, 15 percent of alt-A 
mortgages, and 27 percent of subprime mortgage s were 90 or more days past due or in 
foreclosure in January. The credit quality of consumer loans has also  continued to deteriorate.  Delinquency rates 
on credit cards in securitized pools, on auto  loans at captive finance companies, and on 
credit card and other consumer loans held by commercial banks have all risen 
significantly, with some exceeding the p eak levels of the last recession.  
Interest rates on consumer lo ans fell over the intermeeting pe riod, with a decline in rates 
on new auto loans partly owing to an increa se in dealer incentives .  Both nonrevolving 
and revolving debt outstandi ng contracted over the three months ending in January.  
Spreads on AAA-rated ABS have fallen significa ntly since the beginning of the year 
amid optimism that the TALF may improve market conditions. 
Long-term mutual funds, which experienced hea vy redemptions in the second half of last 
year, attracted moderate inflows,  on net, over the first couple months of this year.  Over 
the past several weeks, however, equity f unds have had large outflows likely owing, in 
part, to declines in stock prices.  Money market funds had moderate net inflows in 
January and small outflows in February. 
Treasury Finance 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned $254 billi on of nominal coupon 
securities, roughly double the ra te of a year ago.  The auctions for nominal coupon 
securities were well received, and indirect bids, a rough measure of demand from foreign

3 In the fourth quarter, Standard & Poor’s upgraded a substantial number of municipal bonds, but the 
upgrades reflected a change in the company’s approach to rating these securities.  In particular, the change 
more closely aligned ratings for municipal bonds with those for corporate bonds with similar default and 
recovery rates.   official institutions, were above recent av erages.  Foreign custody holdings of Treasury 
securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York—another indi cator of foreign  
demand for such securities—increased steadily over the intermeeting period.  Meanwhile, 
Treasury bill issuance totaled $762 billion ove r the intermeeting period, about 25 percent 
more than issuance over a similar period last year.  Net issuance of bills under the 
Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) was about $25 billion, bringing the outstanding 
bills issued through March 3 under the SFP to about $200 billion. 
Liquidity in nominal Treasury markets showed some signs of improvement during the 
intermeeting period but remains strained.  Average bid-asked spreads on on-the-run 
nominal Treasury notes were relatively stable near their pre-crisis levels.  The magnitude of pricing errors from the staff’s nominal yield curve model decreased notably but was 
still quite large.  Daily average volume in the market for on-the-run Treasury securities picked up a bit but remains low.  The spreads between on- and off-the-run 10-year Treasury notes continued to be very elevated. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Issuance of long-term municipal bonds rema ined tepid in February, and lower-rated 
entities appear to be having di fficulty raising funds.  Even so, conditions in the municipal 
bond market showed some signs of improveme nt over the intermeeting period.  Yields on 
long-term municipal bonds decreased over th e period as investor concerns about the 
credit quality of municipal bonds appeared to ease somewhat with  the passage of the 
fiscal stimulus bill.  The ratio of yiel ds on municipal bonds to those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities rema ined high by historical standards.

Money and Bank Credit M2 increased at an average annual rate of 9 percent during January and February, a 
considerable deceleration from the pace seen in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Even so, the 
pace was rapid given the contraction in the economy.  Growth in liquid deposits, which 
represent about 60 percent of all M2 a ssets, remained strong.  Among the smaller 
components of M2, retail money funds ran off considerably in January and February, reflecting sizable outflows from Treasury -only funds, which currently are paying

 extremely low rates.  Small time deposits also contracted, as the inst itutions that had in 
recent months been bidding aggressively for these retail funds stopped doing so.   
Currency growth was robust in January a nd February, with much of the strength 
estimated to have come from foreign demand. 
Bank credit contracted in Janua ry and February on weakness in both loans and securities.  
C&I loans decreased at an average annual rate  of 7¾ percent, as banks reported broad-
based paydowns.  In addition, a few large loans to companies involved in recent mergers 
and acquisitions reportedly were repaid with funds raised in the corporate bond market.  
Commercial real estate loans also declined  in January and February.  Consumer loans 
originated by banks continued to expand at a moderate pace, on balance, over the first 
two months of the year.  Consumer loans held on balance sheet advanced sharply, mainly reflecting increases at a few banks that purch ased loans from their affiliated finance 
companies.  In addition, some banks br ought loans back onto their books that had 
previously been securitized. 
Fourth-quarter Call Report da ta showed continued deterioration in the condition of 
commercial banks.  Measures of profitability fell to their lowest levels since the late 
1980s because of large realized losses on invest ment securities, further increases in loan-
loss provisions, a decline in trading reve nue, and write-downs of intangible assets. 
The credit quality of the loans and securi ties on banks’ books weakened considerably in 
the fourth quarter.  Bank charge-offs as a per centage of all loans rose to nearly 2 percent, 
the highest rate since the series began in 1985, w ith increases recorded in all categories of 
lending.  The delinquency rate for all loans rose to about 4½ percent, with increases 
posted in all major categories.  The mark-t o-market value of non-agency MBS—defined 
as fair value over historical cost—dec lined to about 80 cents on the dollar. 
Commercial banks received $66 billion in capit al from their holding company parents in 
the fourth quarter, most of which was transferred as common equity.  This amount, presumably reflecting in large part funding provided by the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was by far the largest such transfer seen over the past 25 years.  The resulting 
increase in aggregate commerc ial bank capital more than offset aggregate losses and 
write-downs during the quarter, and regulat ory capital ratios based on risk-weighted 
assets rose noticeably.  In c ontrast, leverage ratios showed a modest decline, held down 
by substantial increases in cash assets, a cat egory that has a risk weight of zero and 
includes reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve.

 Loan price data from the February Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicate that 
C&I loan rate spreads over comparable-mat urity market instruments rose modestly 
overall from the November survey.  In addi tion, spreads increased sharply for lower-risk 
loans, especially for those not made under previous commitment—a category heavily 
influenced by current market conditions.

 IV-1 U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services  
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in December to $39.9 billion from a 
revised $41.6 billion in November, as a sizable decline in imports was almost entirely offset b y a significant fall in exports.  December’s trade deficit is the narrowest in more 
than five years.   
 
The value of exports of goods and servi ces fell 6 percent in December.  About one half of 
this fall was due to a decline in exports of industrial supplies, which  partly reflect ed 
lower prices for these goods.  Exports of automotive products, agricultural goods, and consumer goods also exhibited sizable decli nes.  Exports of capital goods moved down 
only slightly, with significant declines in exports of semiconductors and machinery partly offset by a strong rebound in exports of aircraft  after the end of production disruptions at 
Boeing.  
 The average value of exports in the fourth quarter decreased 41 percent at an annual rate, as all major categories of exports moved down.  Exports of industrial supplies and capital goods exhibited particularly pronounced falls.  The fall in exports of industrial supplies in large part reflected lower prices.  The decline in exports of capital goods importantly

reflected lower aircraft exports from Boeing, arising from the production disruptions that 
occurred in October and November. 
      
The
 value of imports of goods and services declined 5.5 percent in December , with all 
major  categories recording declines.  As with exports, much of the decline was 
concentrated in industrial supplies, for which prices have fallen sharply.  The value of oil imports declined despite an increase in volume s on account of a continued drop in price.  
Imports of capital goods and auto motive products also recorded sizable decline s.       
 
The
 average value of imports in the fourth quarter decreased 48 percent at an annual rate.  
The decrease reflected a large decl ine in the value of oil imports  due to substantially 
lower prices.  All other major categories of imports also declined sharply.    
    
Pr
ices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.  After  December’s 1.3 percent decline, prices of core import s fell 
0.9 percent in January. The January drop was driven by a 4.6 per cent fall in the prices for 
nonfuel industrial supplies , reflecting lower prices for metals and chemicals . In contrast, 
prices o f imported finished goods rose 0.2 percent on the back of a 0.5 percent increase in 
prices for capital goods exc luding computers and semiconductors. The prices of foods 
and consumer goods were unchanged in January.  Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil registered its sixth 
straight monthly decline, falling 2.4 percent in January.  This decline, however, was much smaller than in previous months.  T he spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) 
crude oil averaged $42 per barrel in January, little changed from December.  The spot 
price of WTI closed on March 11 at $4 2.33 per barrel.  
 
Exports. P ri
ces of exported core goo ds rose 0.8 percent in January, pushed up by a 
6.2 percent increase in prices of  agricultural products and a 1 percent climb in prices of 
capital goods  excluding computers and semiconductors.  T hese increases were partly 
offset by a 1.2 percent decline in the prices of non- agricultural industrial supplies, le d by 
a fall in the price s of chemical s.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
 
 
 
.  Overall, flows during December and January were similar to those during the 
months of intense turmoil in the fall, although there were a few indications of renewed 
investor willingness to make cross -border investments. 
For the fourth quarter of 2008 as a whole, foreign official flows swung to an outflow as some countries, , sold reserves to support their currencies (see line 1 of 
the table “Summary of U.S. International Transactions”).  These unusual outflows represent a sharp reversal from the strong pace of foreign official inflows recorded earlier in the year.  Net sales by foreign official institutions in the fourth quarter were concentrated in agency securities, while acquisitions of Treasury securities,  
, remained robust.  The selloff of agency securities paused in January, reversing 
to small net purchases (see the bottom panels of the figure “Foreign Official Financial Inflows through January 2009”).  These flows into agencies, coupled with stronger Treasury purchases , restored total foreign official activity to an inflow for 
January.   
.  
D
rawings on central bank liquidity swap facilities (included in line 2) expanded 
substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which generated significant official outflows as Federal Reserve deposit claims at partner  central banks increased.  As noted in 
previous Greenbooks, this expansion appeared to ease dollar funding pressures abroad.    As the partner central banks lent dollar funds to their domestic markets, European-owned banks dramatically reduced their borrowing from U.S. subsidiaries, which produced unusually large net banking inflows (line 3) for the fourth quarter.  In January, as the tone of some financial markets improved and European banks were able to access other sources of funding, including U.S. banks, drawings on the swap lines contracted. 
T
he intensified financial turmoil of the fourth quarter was characterized by a 
strengthening of flight- to-safety flows into Treasury securities by foreign private 
investors (line 4a) and a general deleveraging, as  private foreigners sold, on net, all other 
types of U.S. securities.  Private foreigners continued to sell significant amounts of agency securities (line 4b) through January, while net purchases of U.S. stocks hovered near zero in recent months.  In addition, the gross volume of cross-border transactions in  
 
 

IV-8 
securities (not shown) declined appreciably throughout the fourth quarter and into 
January.  Breaking a trend that has held for most of the turmoil, private foreign net Treasury purchases weakened notab ly in December and swung to net sales in January.  
The geographic distribution of these sales is consistent with foreign hedge funds selling to meet redemption requests.  In one bright spot, in December private foreigners made positive net purchases of U.S. corporate bonds (line 4c) for the first time since May 2008.  However, a portion of this December figure reflects sales of ABS by the U.S. subsidiary of a large Swiss bank to a special purpose vehicle established by the Swiss National Bank to acquire problem assets.  
 
 
 
  U
.S. residents sold foreign securities, on net, every month between July and December 
2008 (line 5).  This retraction of funds from foreign investments was a sharp departure 
from the trends of the past several years before the turmoil, and it provided an unusual boost to net private inflows in the third and fourth quarters (see the bottom panels of the 
figure “Private Securities Flows through January 2009”).  January, however, was a very 
strong month for foreign bond issuance, prompting a return to net purchases of foreign bonds by U.S. residents in that month.  
Finally, quarterly data on the cross -border positions of nonbank U.S. entities (which will 
be included in line 10) show a steep drop in both commercial liabilities and commercial 
claim s in the fourth quarter.  Consistent with the global slowdown in trade, trade credit 
extended by U.S. exporters in the form of trade receivables fell almost 20 percent in the fourth quarter while importers’ trade payables fell more than 40 percent to levels not seen since 2004.  About one-third of this decline in payables is against oil-producing countries, likely reflecting the fall in oil prices.

Foreign Financial Markets 
Since the time of the January Greenbook, foreign equity markets have declined sharply 
and the dollar has appreciated broadly, as the already gloomy outlook for foreign economic growth dimmed further.  Among the advanced foreign economies, headline equity indexes in Europe and Japan fell 8 to 9 percent over this period, led by the banking sector amid mounting concerns over the stability of the global banking system. European bank shares fell more than 12 percent as earnings reports for the fourth quarter were weaker than had been expected and fears about the exposure of many western European banks to emerging Europe increased. 
 
T
he major currencies index of the dollar rose 3 percent on net since the time of the 
January Greenbook, led by an 11 percent appreciation of the dollar against the yen.  The rise in the dollar was drive n in large part by weak foreign data, with indicators for Japan 
being particularly disappointing over the period. The dollar appreciated by a more modest 
1½ percent against the euro.  Implied volatilities on euro-dollar and dollar- yen have 
declined recentl y, but are still elevated by historical standards.  
 
T
he European Central Bank (ECB) cut its target for the main policy rate from 2 to 
1.5 percent on March 5 and signaled that further cuts were likely.  The effective euro 
overnight rate had been trading consistently below the 2 percent target, and was little changed following the ECB’s announcement, indicating that monetary conditions have been easier than the ECB’s target would imply.  The Bank of Canada cut its target for the overnight interest rate 50 basis points to 0.5 percent on March 3 and signaled for the first time that it may take further steps to inject liquidity.  The Bank of England cut its Bank Rate by a cumulative 1 percentage point, to 50 basis points.   
 
Despite rising concerns over the health of many financial institutions, conditions in money markets were relatively stable.  Libor -OIS spreads in euro narrowed moderately, 
and the basis spreads implied by foreign exchange swaps between the dollar and the euro decreased 7 to 13 basis points on net.  One-month Libor-OIS spreads in sterling rose 20 basis points between mid- February and early March, but have since retraced most of 
that rise.  Several governments took further steps to support financial markets over the period.  The Bank of England secured permission to purchase up to £150 billion in government and corporate bonds through its Asset Purchase Facility.  Yields on long- term British gilts fell 60 basis points after the announcement that the Bank of 
England would begin purchasing government securities and are now 44 basis points lower than at the time of the January Greenbook.  In addition to the Bank of England’s 
IV-13 
announcements, the British government also launched its Asset Protection Scheme, 
which insured £325 billion of assets placed in the Scheme by Royal Bank of Scotland and £260 billion of assets from Lloyds.  The Bank of Japan voted to resume purchases of equities held on banks’ balance sheets and announced plans to purchase up to 1 trillion  yen in corporate bonds.  The Bank of Japan also began its previously announced 
purchases of commercial paper.  
 
I
n aggregate, the dollar has appreciated 3½ percent against the currencies of our other 
important trading partners since the time of the January Greenbook, boosted by a 9 percent app reciation against the Mexican peso and the Korean won.  Mexican 
authorities continued to intervene to support the peso, and South Korean officials also acknowledged intervening against the dollar.  The dollar rose another 7 percent against the Russian ruble.  The Central Bank of Russia announced a modification to its exchange rate regime saying that it had “finished” devaluing the ruble against the euro/dollar basket 
and that it was establishing a range within which it would allow the ruble to trade.  
Curre ncy pressures were also evident in Hungary, with the dollar up 7 percent against the 
forint.  
 
E
quity indexes rose 7 percent on net in China and were modestly higher in Korea and 
Brazil, but declined 2 to 10 percent in most other Asian and Latin American countries.  Emerging European stock markets declined 6 to 15 percent.  Flows to emerging European equity funds have declined by about 10 percent since the January Greenbook, consistent with the rise of EMBI spreads for emerging Europe in recent weeks, as conc erns about 
those economies have increased.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Output growth in the advanced foreign economies collapsed in the fourth quarter, with 
sharp declines in GDP in all the major economies and a double-digit drop in Japan.  The performance of trade and investment was particularly abysmal, and consumption also 
declined sharply.  Recent indicators of economic activity, particularly industrial production, suggest that the pace of contraction accelerated late in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, which provides significant negativ e momentum going forward.  
Across the advanced economies, the employment situation has continued to deteriorate, and broad-based measures of consumer spending are flat or falling.  Confidence indicators for both households and businesses remain downbeat, and surveys provide little compelling evidence of a turnaround.    Consumer price inflation has continued to moderate, pushed down by lower energy prices.  Excluding food and energy prices, the slowing in consumer prices has been more 
contained, but the slight rise in core inflation observed last summer seems to have 
reversed.  Over the intermeeting period, the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank reduced their policy rates 50 basis points each, and the Bank of England cut a cumulative 100 basis points at its February and March meetings.  Major central banks increasingly signaled their willingness to use unconventional monetary policy tools.  In addition, a number of governments have moved forward with their fiscal stimulus plans.

  Japanese  real GDP fell at an annual rate of 12.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the third 
consecutive quarterly decline.  With this latest fall, the cumulative decline in GDP since 
its first-quarter peak is almost 5 percent, the largest peak -to-trough fall since the series 
began in 1955.  In the fourth quarter, a collapse in external demand drove the decline in output:  Exports fell 45 percent as imports rose, and net exports contributed nearly 
10 percentage points to the GDP contraction.  Total domestic demand contracted at a more subdued rate, falling only 1.2 percent, which was led b y private investment.  Only 
government consumption and inventories made positive contributions to growth. 
Indicators for the first quarter are stunningly negative.  The industrial production index plunged in November, December, and January, which brought the index 31 percent below its May 2008 peak and equal to its level of May 1984.  Real exports fell 16 percent (not at an annual rate) in January and are down 38 percent since their July 2008 peak.  Real imports, which had been growing robustly through October, dropped 7.3 percent in January.  The employment situation has continued to deteriorate this quarter, with the job openings- to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the 
number of officially registered job seekers) sinking a further 8 percent in January.  After a brief respite in November, household expenditures resumed their downward trajectory in December and January.  
IV-22 
 
 Japanese consumer price s were unchanged over the 12 months ending in January, sharply 
below the 2 .3 percent inflation rate reached in July.  Excluding food and energy prices, 
12-month consumer price inflation was negative 0.2 percent in January.  Despite the 
decline in agriculture commodity prices, food price inflation has stayed elevated.   
Although the policy rate of the Bank of Japan remains above zero, at 0.1 percent, t he 
Bank is also taking many measures reminiscent of the earlier q uantitative easing period, 
including the purchase of commercial paper , corporate bonds, equities from banks, and 
government bonds.  On the fiscal front, political infighting appears to be slowing the 
implementation of the fiscal stimulus packages announced earlier this year, and the government has yet to decide on new fiscal measures.   
IV-23 
 
 
IV-24 
 
 
 
 In the euro area , real GDP contracted 5.7 percent at  an annual rate in the fourth quarter, 
with GDP for Germany and Italy falling more than 8  percent and 7  percent, respectively.  
Total domestic demand fell 2.3 percent, with a sharp contraction in investment of 
10.5 percent.  A collapse in trade resulted in  a sizable negative contribution of net exports 
to headline growth of 3.5 percentage points.  Inventory accumulation contributed 2.2 percentage points to growth. 
Recent indicators for the first quarter continue to point to significant weakness in the euro area.  The business climate index and economic sentiment indicators continued to fall in January and February, reaching record lows.  Purchasing manager’s indexes (PMIs), which had stabilized in January, resumed their slide in February.  The German Ifo index also declined in February.  The euro-area unemployment rate edged up to 8.2 percent in January, almost 1 percentage point above its year- earlier level.  
A
ccording to the flash estimate, headline inflation in February was 1.2 percent.  In 
January, t welv e-month consumer price inflation in the euro area had moderated to 
1.1 percent  and was 1.8 percent excluding energy and unprocessed food.  
IV-25 
 
 
 In the p ast few months, several governments—including those of Germany, France, Italy, 
and Spain—announced fiscal stimulus packages.  T he measures adopted so far include 
modest corporate tax credits for new investment or increases in expenditures on public 
infrastructure.  Since the last Greenbook, Finland announced a fiscal package of 2 billion euro (1.1 percent of GDP), mainly focused on infrastructure.  Austria also announced a plan of 3.2 billion euro (1.1 percent of GDP) focused on tax rebates and tax cuts.  On February 4, in contrast, Ireland announced a deficit-reduction plan based on tax hikes, after a warnin g from the European Commission regarding its high deficit, which is 
widely expected to exceed 12 percent of GDP in 2009.   
On February 18, the European Commission initiated excessive deficit procedures against Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Latvia, and M alta, as they breached the 3 percent budget 
deficit limits.  Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Jaoquin Almunia stated that the commission will use the full flexibility embedded in the Stability and Growth 
Pact when considering the next steps under the excessive deficit procedure.  
The
 ECB reduced its main policy rate 50 basis points, to 1.5 percent, at its March 
meeting .  ECB President Trichet has signaled that, given the deterioration in economic 
activity in the euro area, further monetary policy easing is likely.  
IV-26 
 
IV-27 
 
 
 
 In the United Kingdom,  real GDP contracted 6.0 percent at an annual rate in the fourth 
quarter, reduced by a large  drawdown in inventories and weak final domestic demand.  
Consumption fell 2.7 percent, and investment declined almost 9 percent .  Government 
expenditures and net exports made positive contributions to GDP growth.  However, the 
volume of trade and manufacturing output both tumbled about 20 percent . 
For
ward -looking indicators were uniformly gloomy in the intermeeting period.  
Consumer and business confidenc e remained at or close to record lows in February.  PMI 
readings  continue to point to a severe contraction in the manufacturing, services, and 
construction sectors.  According to the Confederation of Business Industries, the net balance of manufacturers ex pecting capital expenditures to fall over the coming year 
reached nearly 60  percent in the first quarter, the most pessimistic reading since the 
survey began in 1958.  Moreover, t he value of new housing orders slid to a series low in 
December.  
Headline inflation ticked down to 3.0 percent in January, which marked the end of a series of three public letters by the Bank of England (BOE) explaining why inflation had exceeded its 2 percent  target by more than 1 percentage point.  The index of produc er 
input prices rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months to January, in sharp retreat from its peak of 34 percent reached in June 2008.  The steady fall in house prices continued in February, 
IV-28 
 
 and 31,000 loans were approved for house purchases in January, in line with the average 
over the past six months but only about one-fourth of the average of the 2001-07 period. 
T
he BOE lowered its main policy rate 100 basis points, to 0.5 percent, in two separate 
cuts over the intermeeting period.  On February 13, the BOE initiated the purchase of commercial paper in exchange for Treasury bills at its Asset Purchase Facility (APF), a measure aimed at restoring credit market liquidity.  On March 5, the BOE announced a £75 billion asset purchase program financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.  The initial plan uses one- half of the Treasury -authorized amount of £150 billion.  The 
new reserves will be used principally to purchase medium- and long- term government 
securities and to conduct purchase of private assets at th e APF.  The government also 
signed agreements with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, two major U.K. banks in which it owns large stakes, to insure them against future losses on their assets in exchange for a fee and a commitment to increase lending to  creditworthy borrowers.

 Canadian  GDP fell 3.4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.  Total domestic 
demand was down 5.6 percent, as consumption, investment, and to a lesser extent, 
inventories, all contributed negatively to growth.  Imports collapsed at a faster pace than expo rts, and net exports contributed 2.2 percentage points to growth.  Government 
consumption rose 2.8 percent. 
Incoming data for the first quarter are s parse.  Employment fell for the third consecutive 
month in January, pushing three-month job losses to a record level.  The unemployment 
rate rose to 7.2 percent, well above its January 2008 low of 5.8 percent.  In February, the PMI bounced off its historic low of 36.1 to 45.2.  Several other indicators, including monthly GDP, retail sales, and manufacturing orders, fell sharply at the end of the fourth quarter, suggesting significant weakness coming into the quarter.   
In January, headline inflation was 1.1 percent , as energy prices continued to fall on a 12-
month basis; excluding food and energy, inflation was 1.2 percent, down from 1.5 percent in December.   
T
he Bank of Canada has reduced its policy interest rate 50 basis points to 0.5 percent 
over the intermeeting period.  On March 3, the Bank indicated that it plans to keep rates low until recovery takes hold and signaled possible future “credit and quantitative easing.”  On January 27, Canada announced a fiscal stimulus program, consisting of tax 
IV-31 
 
 cuts, infrastructure spending, and job training.  The stimulus is expected to amount to 
about 1.4 percent of GDP for 2009 and 1.5 percent of GDP for 2010.  The plan is expected to pass the legislature in late March or early April.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs) weakened significantly in the 
fourth quarter, with most of them experiencing sharp contractions.  Financial conditions in emerging markets have also worsened somewhat since the time of the January Greenbook, with exchange rates falling further and CDS premiums continuing to rise.  
We estimate that real GDP in emerging markets declined at a 9 : percent pace at an 
annual rate in the fourth quarter, the worst since the start of our quarterly series in 1970.  
Exports, industrial production, and confidence indicators continued to drop in both Latin America and emerging Asia.  Incoming data for January and February strongly suggest a further sharp contraction in the first quarter.  To boost their slowing economies, authorities in EMEs, especially in Asia, have been unveiling fiscal stimulus plans that generally include a significant percentage for infrastructure projects, and have continued 
to loosen monetary policy.  Headline inflation continued to recede in Asia and has begun to come down in Latin America, largely reflecting the decline in commodity prices since the summer and increasing economic slack.  The easing of inflation in Latin America may increase the scope for expansionary policies in that region as well.  
In China , real GDP  data were revised up, boosting our estimate of growth in the fourth 
quarter to a still tepid 1½ percent at an annual rate.  There are some tentative signs that economic activity has begun to stabilize in China, but recent sharp contractions in the rest of the world will likely weigh on Chinese growth going forward.  The PMI rose for the third consecutive month in January, with the new orders and production subindexes above 50, although the aggregate index remained in the contraction range.  After falling sharply in October, industrial production remained relatively flat through the end of the year, with cement production registering positive 12-month growth and steel production rising in December.  Growth of nominal retail sales edged lower in December, but our estimate of real sales growth has hovered around 17 percent on a 12-month basis since August.  Exports plunged in February, whereas imports have been relatively steady over the past three months, although at levels not seen since 2006.  Hence, the trade surplus fell sharply in February after reaching record levels in previous months. 
T
he benchmark bank lending rates have not been lowered further since the end of last 
year, but Chinese authorities have been directly encouraging banks to increase lendin g.  
Consequently, loan growth accelerated sharply in December and January.  Some of these new loans appear to be funding for infrastructure projects related to the fiscal stimulus package amounting to 13 percent of 2008 GDP announced in November.  Consumer

 price inflation has continued to decline, turning negative in February to -1½ percent on a 12-month basis. 
India ’s real GDP  in the fourth quarter shrank nearly 2 percent at an annual rate according 
to staff estimates, its first quarter of negative growth since 2004.  The contraction was 
concentrated largely in the manufacturing sector, although services also slowed considerably.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that industrial production fell considerably in January as credit conditions remained tight.  Consumer price inflation rose in January to 9½ percent on a 12-month basis, but wholesale inflation, which is followed more closel y 
in India, continued to decelerate to 5¼ percent.  The trade deficit narrowed considerably in January, as imports declined more than exports.  The fiscal deficit now stands at 10 percent of GDP, well above the target.  Consequently, the interim budget pas sed last 
week, which will be in effect until a new parliament is elected in May, includes only a 
small tax cut.  The Reserve Bank of India lowered its targets for both the repo and reverse 
repo rates 50 basis points on March 4, bringing them to 5 percent and 3½ percent respectively, their lowest level since they were introduced in 2000.

1 The NIEs are  Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs ),1 re
al GDP  plummeted in the fourth 
quarter as the region’s exports collapsed and domestic demand generally weakened.  The 
most recent data suggest that activity will remain depressed in the current quarter.  Industrial production continued to contract in Singapore and Taiwan, but improved somewhat in South Korea.  Readings on PMI surveys, retail sales, and consumer and business sentiment remain weak.  January exports plunged across the region but, with the exception of South Korea, trade balances remained positive or increased, reflecting larger declines in imports.  Unemployment has risen in all of the NIEs. 
Inflationary pressures continued to recede as economic activity weakened, and  
 energy as 
well as , in some cases, food prices continued to retreat.  Inflation in Taiwan turned 
negative in February reflecting easing food prices.  In January, however, inflation ticked 
up in Hong Kong and Taiwan because of food price increases induced by the lunar new year holiday, which fell in January this year but in February last year.   With growth 
slowing rapidly, the central banks of South Korea and Taiwan continued to ease monetary policy, lowering their policy rates 50 and 25 basis points, respectively.  In addition, in early February, Taiwan unveiled a multi- year fiscal stimul us plan, which for 
this year is expected to amount to $9.5 billion, about 2½ percent of GDP.

2 The ASEAN-4  are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.   
 
 
 Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN-4) 2, real GDP growth 
slowed dramatically in the fourth quarter.  Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia each experienced their first contractions since the Asian crisis.  The Philippines was the exception, however, as GDP grew a stronger- than-expected 4 percent at an annual rate in 
the fourth quarter.  The weakness in activity is attributable to shar p declines in 
manufacturing and trade.  Exports and imports continued to fall across the region, as much as 40 percent in January on a 12-month basis for Indonesia and the Philippines.  Available indicators for January suggest that activity will remain wea k in the near term.  
Industrial production in Thailand was 21 percent below its year- earlier level in January, 
the worst decline in its history.  In Indonesia, leading indicators for consumer confidence and investment in January suggest a further contraction in the first quarter. 
Inflation continues to recede in the region.  With declining price pressures, central banks 
ha
ve been easing monetary policies.  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand 
aggressively lowered their target policy rates this year.  In Indonesia, the government passed a fiscal stimulus bill amounting to 1½ percent of GDP in February.  The plan will be implemented in 2009 and 2010 and it involves a reduction of taxes, an increase in infrastructure spending, and an energy subsidy.  In Malaysia,  the Finance Minister 
announced in mid -March a fiscal stimulus package valued at 9 percent of GDP .  The plan 
will be implemented in 2009 and 2010, and it will increase the 2009 fiscal deficit to 
7½ percent  of GDP .

 In Mexico , real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 10 percent in the fourth quarter, its 
steepest decline since the 1995 crisis.  Output of services and manufacturing fell 
11 percent and 9 percent at an annual rate, respectively.  Exports continued to decline reflecting weak external demand from the United States, while imports were curtailed by the depreciation of the peso, the continuing decline in remittances, and weakening consumer sentiment.  The trade deficit, which had widened in the fourth quarter, began to narrow in January.  On a 12-month basis, auto production contracted 51 percent in January and 38 percent in February.  Manufacturing PMI continued to slide in January and ticked up slightly in February. 
After peaking in December, inflation moderated slightly in January.  The pass-through of previous increases in food and energy prices as well as the sharp depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar appear to have impeded the disinflationary process.  In early February, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) temporarily engaged in an unannounced 
intervention in the foreign exchange market.  Last week, the BOM announced that they were discontinuing the ad-hoc interventions.  In February, the BOM cut the policy rate 25 basis points, which was less than had been expected.  Officials cited pressures in the financial markets and risk of higher inflation as the main reasons for the modest size of the rate cut.

 In Brazil , data releases since the January Greenbook continue to paint a gloomy picture.  
Real GDP in the  fourth quarter fell 13½ percent at an annual rate.  Employment in both 
formal and informal sectors fell sharply in December and continued to decline in January.  
More recent data indicate that economic activity has continued to be weak in the current quarter, with the exception of auto production, which soared in January as a result of fiscal measures that targeted autos.  Exports and imports in February were down 25 percent and 35 percent respectively, relative to their year -earlier levels.  Headline 
inflation stood at 6 percent on a 12-month basis in February, but more disaggregated data 
suggest some dissipation of the pressures from growth in food prices and exchange rate pass-through that kept both headline and core inflation elevated over the first hal f of 
2008. 
In late January, the central bank reduced its target for the overnight interest rate 100 basis points, to 12¾ percent, as had been expected.  Subsequently, the Brazilian government 
announced that it would increase credit from the government development bank 
R$100 billion (about $43 billion) to support the government- controlled company 
Petrobras and other firms.  With fiscal revenues down considerably, in late February, there were indications that the government is considering lowering its target for the consolidated primary fiscal surplus from 3.8 percent of GDP to 2.8 percent of GDP.

 In Argentina , indicators point to a considerable slowdown of economic activity.  Real 
GDP contracted in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2002.  The trade balance 
narrowed, reflecting a fall in exports due to weak external demand and declines in commodity prices.  Economic activity weakened further in January.  Industr ial 
production contracted 6 percent, led by a fall in automotive production.  Firms producin g 
base metals cut output 22 percent from a year earlier.   The press reported that the 
government may take control over the trading of agricultural products.  If the plan i s 
implemented, it would renew tensions between farmers and the government and could trigger a new round of strikes.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell  slightly  in 
January because of  weak domestic demand and declines in commodity prices; however, 
the reliability of the official inflation data remains questionable.  
In Venezuela , fourth -quarter real GDP grew an estimated 6½ percent at an annual rate, 
supported by expansionary policies.  Nonpetroleum output was up an estimated 7 percent while petroleum output declined 13 percent.  Growth last year as a whole slowed to 3¼ percent on a four-quarter basis, down markedly from the rapid pace experienced between 2004 and 2007.  Inflation re mained very high at a 12 -month rate of almost 
30 percent in January.  
In response to the collapse in the price of oil and resulting pressures on public finances, the government has taken stopgap measures to shore up the budget, including payment 
IV-47 
delays by government-owned PDVSA and the transfer of another $12 billion of the 
central bank’s international reserves to the government’s development bank .  Hugo 
Chávez  won a referendum in mid- February that allows him to stand for reelection in 
2012.  The government was widely expected to devalue the bolivar after the referendum, 
but concerns over the inflationary consequences of devaluation have shifted the 
government's priorities to the control of food prices.

 In Russia, economic activity continues to weake n.  Retail trade has contracted every 
month from October through January.  I ndustrial production in January was down 
16 percent from a year earlier, the worst decline on record.  The PMI has remained below 40 from November through January.  Inflati on is beginning to decelerate, but remains 
high at a 12-month rate of more than 13 percent in December.  Moreover, the exchange rate may continue to be a source of inflati on pressure as the cent ral bank has set a new 
lower bound for the ruble against a euro/dollar basket. 
Russia’s financial system has been under consid erable stress since the onset of the global 
f
inancial crisis, reflecting in  part the Russian corporate sector’s heavy dependence on 
foreign borrowing.  Unlike other EMEs, Russia has been raising intere st rates to try to 
stave off severe currency depreciation pressu res.  Russia’s international reserves have 
continued to decline and were  $381 billion at the end of Fe bruary, down from a peak of 
$600 billion last August, reflecting foreign ex change intervention, the provision of dollar 
funding to Russian banks and corporations by the government, and valuation losses from 
the euro’s decline against the dollar on the euro-denominated portion of the reserves.
