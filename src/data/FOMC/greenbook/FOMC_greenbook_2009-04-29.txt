1 The emergency unemployment insurance program that began in July has likely boosted labor force 
participation and the unemployment rate by encouraging unemployed individuals to remain in the labor 
force.  The staff estimates that, in March, emergency benefits contributed about 0.3 percentage point to the

II-1 The data on economic activity have been mixe d recently, but on balance the declines in 
some components of final demand appear to be slowing.  To be sure, firms have 
continued to make substantia l cuts in production and empl oyment in recent months, 
adjustments that are likely associated, at least in part, with the sizable inventory 
overhangs that have persisted into early th is year.  Nonetheless, smoothing through the 
monthly volatility, consumer spe nding seems to have stabilized in the first quarter after a 
steep drop in the second half of last year.  In addition, housing ac tivity, while still quite 
depressed, has leveled off in recent months.  Meanwhile, business fixed investment continued to contract sharply in the first quarter, with the most recent indicators still 
pointing to further reductions in outlays fo r both equipment and structures.  State and 
local governments are cutting back on spending as well.  Overall consumer prices have 
risen moderately in the first three months of this year after falling sharply in the fourth 
quarter of last year.  Core PCE prices, whic h were about unchanged in the final months of 
2008, have picked up over the first three months of 2009. 
Labor Market Developments 
Labor market conditions deteriorated fu rther in March.  Pr ivate nonfarm payroll 
employment registered its fifth consecutiv e monthly decline of more than 600,000, and 
job losses remained widespread across industries.  In addition to shedding jobs, firms 
continued to cut their labor input by shorteni ng hours worked:  The average weekly hours 
of production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls ticked down another 0.1 hour in March to the low level of 33.2 hours.   Taking into account reductions in both 
employment and the workweek, aggregat e hours of production and nonsupervisory 
workers fell at annual rate of 8¾ percent last quarter. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  rose 0.4 percentage point in March to 
8.5 percent.  (Thus far in this recession, th e unemployment rate has risen 3.6 percentage 
points, comparable with the sharp incr eases recorded duri ng the 1973-75 and 1981-82 
recessions.)  In addition, th e fraction of workers who were working part time for 
economic reasons—another measure of the util ization of labor—continued to rise last 
month.  The labor force participation rate, which was fairly stab le through the third 
quarter of last year, has moved down sin ce then and stood at 65.5 percent in March.

Other indicators also point to an ongoing de terioration in labor demand.  The four-week 
moving average of initial claims for unemp loyment insurance has remained high since 
the reference week for the March employme nt report, and the number of individuals 
receiving unemployment insurance benefits, rela tive to the size of the labor force, has 
surged to its highest level since 1980.  Layoff rates—as gauged by the percentage of 
short-term job losers in the household survey  and the layoff and discharge rate from the 
Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey—have stayed very high, while measures of job 
vacancies are low.  Meanwhile, alterna tive measures of labor market slack—job 
availability as reported in the Conference Board Survey and hard-to-fill positions in the 
NFIB survey—remain at levels consistent  with elevated slack.  Looking forward, 
indicators of hiring plans from the NFIB and Manpower, Inc. surveys have weakened 
further and, not surprisingly, households’ expect ations of future labor market conditions 
remain depressed. 
Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) declined  1½ percent in both Februa ry and March, and total IP 
fell at an annual rate of 20 per cent for the first quarter as a whole.  The declines in output 
were once again widespread across industries; the diffusion index of three-month changes 
edged up in March but continued to indicat e that significantly more industries cut 
production last month relative to three mont hs earlier than increased it.  In the

manufacturing sector, output fell 1.7 percen t in March, and the f actory operating rate 
declined to 65.8 percent, another low for a series that goes back to 1948.2 
At an annual rate of just 4.4 million units, pr oduction of domestic light motor vehicles in 
the first quarter stood at its lo west level in the 32 years fo r which comparable data are 
available.  While inventory stocks are extremely low, days’ supply remained elevated 
when gauged at last months’ low level of  sales.  Looking ahead, industry schedules 
currently call for assemblies to move up th is quarter but only to a 5.9 million unit pace. 
Elsewhere in the transportation equipment industry, the news is less bleak.   
 
 
.  Ho wever, the company recently 
announced that it plans to slow the pace of  production for the Boeing 777 starting in mid-
2010.  The output of military aircraft increa sed about 2¼ percent in 2008, reflecting an 
accelerated replacement cycle and an increase in the modification and remanufacturing of 
some aircraft models.  In 2009, the output  of military aircraft production will be 
supported by the ramp-up of the new F-35 jet fighter program; scheduled production of 
both combat and transport aircraft has also increased. 
The output of high-technology products decreased 3.1 percent in  March and contracted at 
an annual rate of nearly 30 pe rcent in the first quarter.  Semiconductor production fell at 
an annual rate of almost 50 percent in the fi rst quarter, with the declines broadly based 
across the various types of semiconductors .  Most notably, microprocessor production 
posted another sizable drop, and the output of memory chips continued to plunge.  
Computer production fell at an annual rate of  about 35 percent in the first quarter, 
reflecting an especially sharp deterioration in  the demand for servers.  In contrast, the 
output of communications equipm ent edged up, on net, in the first quarter, likely because 
of an increase in defense a nd homeland security spending. 
                                                 
2 On March 27, the Federal Reserve published its annual revision of industrial production and the related 
measures of capacity and capacity utilization.  The rate  of change in total industrial production was revised 
down for 2007 and 2008.  IP is now estimated to have advanced 1.8 percent during 2007 (measured fourth 
quarter to fourth quarter), 0.3 percentage point less than previously estimated, and to have fallen 6.7 percent during 2008, a decline that is 0.6 percentage point larger than previously published.  Revisions to the index for total IP in earlier years were very sm all, and the pattern of production in recent months was 
little changed.  The revised rates of capacity utilization for 2007 and 2008 are about ½ percentage point lower than previously published; operating rates in  earlier years were little changed.  Manufacturing 
capacity is now expected to fall 1.2 percent in 2009, a decline that is 0.6 percentage point larger than 
initially estimated.

II-11 
Looking ahead, although Intel has reported tent ative signs that the PC market may be 
bottoming out and high-tech spending plan s from NABE’s quarterly survey edged up, 
other available indicators point to a further weakening in high-tech output in the near 
term.  Data from Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Intern ational show that 
bookings and shipments of the equipment used to fabricate semiconductors moved 
roughly sideways in February and March after having fallen sharpl y in January; these 
data suggest that semiconductor producers remain wary of the outlook for demand and are hesitant to invest.  In addition, new orders for printed circuit boards moved down in 
February, a sign of weak near-term dema nd from downstream producers, such as 
computers and other consumer electronics. 
Production in the energy sector has fallen 4½ percent so far this year.  This decline 
reflects both a plunge in drilling activity ( likely a lagged response to the earlier sharp 
declines in energy prices) and weathe r-driven swings in utilities output. 
Outside of the energy, transportation equipm ent, and high-technology industries (which 
together account for just over one-third of to tal IP), production decreased 1.9 percent in 
March and at an annual rate of 22 percent for the first quarter as a whole.  The production 
of consumer durables and business equipment c ontinues to be partic ularly weak, although 
hefty declines were recorded  in all major market groups except defense and space 
equipment. Available near-term indicators of production po int to further declines  in factory output 
over the next few months, although not as steep as those registered in  the first quarter.  
The new orders diffusion index from the national ISM survey (an indicator of near-term 
manufacturing activity) wa s at an index level of 41 in Ma rch—up from February, but still 
consistent with moderate near-term dec lines in production.  More recently, the new 
orders diffusion indexes from the Empire St ate and Philadelphia Fed surveys moved up 
in April from their record lows in March, thou gh to levels that still suggest some further 
declines in production.  The sta ff’s series on the change in re al orders for durable goods 
(adjusted to exclude industries for which repo rted orders have little information content 
for predicting shipments) paints a similar picture for production to the one provided by 
the business surveys.  Finally, domestic pr oduction has continued to suffer from the 
slump in foreign demand.  Indeed, the manuf acturing export share—defined as the ratio 
of nominal exports of manufactured goods to nominal shipments—plunged in January 
and February after having been on an upw ard trend through the end of last year.

Motor Vehicles 
Sales of light motor vehicles rose to an annual rate of 9.8 million units in March. 
 
.  For the first quarter as a whole, sales of 
light vehicles averaged 9½ million units (annual rate), about ¾ million units below the 
fourth-quarter pace. 
Although several key determinants of retail  vehicle demand such as labor market 
conditions and household wealth remain weak, some indicators appear to have improved.  
Consumers’ assessment of car-buying conditions  in the Reuters/University of Michigan 
survey have moved up so far this year, with a particularly large jump in April.  In part, 
this improvement may reflect the high level of incentives in recent months and an easing 
in financing conditions after the Treasury’s injection of funds into GMAC and Chrysler 
Financial late last year.  In March, GMAC fina nced more than $2 billion in retail vehicle 
contracts—a level consistent with the aver age for this decade—and announced plans to 
further expand financing and to ease lending standards in April and May.3  In addition, 
conditions in secondary auto finance market s have improved lately, which may further 
help spur lending going forward.4 
Consumer Spending  
The incoming data indicate that total consum er spending may have flattened out in the 
first quarter after having fallen sharply over the second half of last year.  Smoothing 
through the monthly volatility, th e latest figures for retail sales suggest that real 
consumption expenditures on goods excluding moto r vehicles increased at an annual rate 
of about 1¼ percent in the first quarter; this compares with an annual rate of decline of 
nearly 9 percent in the second half of last year.  In addition, we estimate that consumer 
spending on new and used motor vehicles and parts increased last quarter following six 
consecutive quarterly declines.  Meanwhile, ou tlays for services were reported to have 
been about flat, on average, in January and February. 
                                                 
3 On April 1, GMAC announced that it would earmar k an additional $5 billion for consumer auto loans 
in April and May, cut interest rates for well-qu alified customers, and accept automotive finance 
applications for customers with credit scores less than 620.  
4 Spreads on AAA-rated auto loan ABS over swap rate s have narrowed significantly so far this year.  
In addition, both Ford and Nissan issued TALF-backed auto loan ABS to strong demand last month; no 
other captive finance companies or rental car companie s have participated in the TALF program to date.

II-17 
Despite the recent relative st ability of consumer spending, the fundamentals for this 
sector generally remain weak.  Ongoing job losses have contributed  to a sharp drop in 
wages and salaries in recent months, alt hough disposable income (DPI) was boosted last 
quarter by several transitory f actors, including tax cuts and transfers implemented as part 
of the latest fiscal stimulus package.  DPI was also lifted by a sharp decline in personal 
tax payments, although this is likely the result of  lower capital gain realizations last year.  
Moreover, house prices have continued to fall,  and despite the recent increase in the stock 
market, equity prices have come down sharpl y over the past year.   Meanwhile, although 
interest rates on auto loans and the availabi lity of credit for vehicle purchases have 
improved recently, rates on credit cards remain very high, and survey data from the April 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices suggest that banks 
continued to tighten standards on ho usehold loans in the first quarter. 
As measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey, consumer sentiment turned up in early 
April as households expressed somewhat more optimism about long-term economic conditions.  That said, the early -April reading was only slight ly above the historical low 
for the series, which was recorded last November. 
Housing  
The latest readings from the housing market suggest that the steep contraction in housing 
activity may have begun to moderate.  Singl e-family housing starts flattened out in 
February and March, and adjusted permit issu ance in this sector—a  useful month-ahead 
indicator of starts—remained a touch above starts in March.  Th e contraction in the 
multifamily sector may also have slowed recently:  The 16 percent decline in starts in the 
first quarter of the year was well below the pace of decline experien ced during the fourth 
quarter of 2008.  However, given the volatility of  this series, we are hesitant to place too 
large a weight on a sing le quarter of data. 
The recent data also suggest that housing demand may have stabilized.  Sales of new single-family homes edged up nearly 5 percent in February,  
 
.  Nevertheless, the level of new home sales remains very 
low, and even with the stock of unsold new single-family homes dropping in February to its lowest level since mid-2002, the months’ supply of new homes at the three-month 
average pace of sales remains very high.

5 Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate agents, many 
foreclosure-related sales are included in the statis tics on existing home sales because banks frequently hire 
real estate agents to sell repossessed properties. 
6 Although the FHA has offered an alternative source of mortgage financing for some higher-risk 
borrowers, the FHA’s relatively strict lending standards and higher costs suggest that such lending is likely 
to have replaced only a part of the re duction in credit from private sources. 
7 Unlike the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s index (formerly known as the OFHEO index, 
calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterp rise Oversight), the LoanPerformance (LP) index 
includes both conforming and nonconforming loans.  In addition, the LP index has better geographic 
coverage than the S&P/Case-Shiller (CS) index.  Th e LP and CS indexes showed similar movements from 
2002 to 2007, but more recently the LP index has declined less than the CS index. In the market for existing single-family homes, sales have been hovering around the 
4 million unit mark since November 2008.  Ex isting home sales held up comparatively 
well over this period relative to new home sales, reflecting, in part, increases in foreclosure-related and other distressed sales.
5  According to the Na tional Association of 
Realtors, the share of foreclosure-related sa les has about doubled over the past year to 
more than 40 percent of transactions in Fe bruary.  The increase in foreclosure-related 
properties on the market appears to have increased affordability, as the states where existing home sales seem to have been most  supported by strong increases in foreclosure-
related sales—California, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona—also saw the largest house price 
declines over 2008. 
More generally, lower mortgage rates and fa
lling house prices have contributed to an 
improvement in housing affordability.  Since early March, rates for conforming 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages have fallen another 30 basis points, there by bringing the total 
decline since October 2008 to about 160 basis points.  Rates on jumbo loans have come 
down as well, although the spread between the rates on jumbo and conforming loans 
remains quite elevated, and the market fo r private-label nonprime mortgages remains 
closed.6  National house prices remain on a downwar d trajectory.  The repeat-sales price 
index for existing single-family homes cal culated by LoanPerformance fell 12 percent 
over the 12 months ending in February, a slight ly greater decline than over the previous 
12-month period.7  These declines improve affordability but also may deter some 
potential buyers worried about purchasing in a falling market:  Evidence from the Reuters/Michigan survey and anecdotal reports suggest that  a preponderance of 
households expect prices to fall in the co ming year, although over the past few months, 
the share of households expecti ng a depreciation has shrunk.

Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E &S) appears to have dropped precipitously 
in the first quarter, with declines about as st eep and widespread as in the fourth quarter.  
Orders and shipments of nondefense capit al goods excluding ai rcraft moved down 
sharply, on net, over the first two months of the year.  Moreover, with new orders running 
well below shipments for the sixth consecuti ve month in February, the backlog of 
unfilled orders continued to shrink. 
With regard to transportation equipment, business outlays for motor vehicles posted 
another steep decline in the first quarter.  Al though deliveries of light  vehicles to rental 
car companies recovered some in February and March after having plunged in January, 
demand for light vehicles from other businesse s has softened further, on balance, so far 
this year.  Sales of medium and heavy trucks  tumbled in the first quarter, and new orders 
were sharply lower, an indication that sale s may slow even further in coming months.  
However, data on aircraft shipments through February and on Boeing deliveries through 
March suggest that business purch ases of aircraft bounced back  in the first quarter after 
being held down in the fourth quarter by the Boeing machinists’ strike. 
Real business outlays for high-tech E&S app ear to have dropped sharply again last 
quarter.  Orders and shipments of communi cations equipment plummeted, on net, over 
January and February.  Indicators of demand for computers and peripherals were more 
mixed:  IP for computers fell at an annual rate  of about 35 percent in the first quarter, and 
imports of high-tech equipment fell substantia lly more than exports through February, the 
most recent month of data available.  Ho wever, nominal orders and shipments of 
computers and peripheral equipment from the Census Bureau survey were little changed, 
on average, in the first two months of the quarter.  The first-quarter NABE survey suggests less gloomy prospects for spending on high-tech E&S:  The survey’s measure of 
high-tech capital expenditu res plans has moved up since the fourth quarter. 
After having plunged in the fourth quarter , real spending on equipment other than 
transportation and high-tech a ppears to have dropped even more steeply in the first 
quarter.  Orders fell sharply in January, as di d shipments, which then firmed only a bit in 
February.  Orders now stand nearly 6 percent below shipments, a sign of further declines in the coming months.

II-23 
The fundamental determinants of investment in E&S remain very weak.  Business output 
contracted steeply in the four th quarter and appears to have dropped considerably further 
last quarter.  In addition, cred it availability remains tight.  In the March NFIB survey, a 
large share of small businesses continued to repo rt difficulties in securing credit.  In the 
latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a preponderance of firms continued to report 
tightening their lending standards on business loans, although the net fraction of banks 
doing so has receded somewhat from the peak reported in the October 2008 survey.  On a 
more positive note, afte r spiking to high levels in the fourth quarter, bond yields have 
edged down since the beginning of the year.  In addition, recent survey measures of 
business conditions and capital spending plans have moved up, albeit modestly, from the 
very low levels occupied in recent months. 
Nonresidential construction  
Real spending on nonresidential  structures turned down la te last year, and nominal 
construction expenditures on nonres idential buildings (that is, structures other than those 
for drilling and mining) suggest th at real outlays contracted furt her in the first quarter.  In 
real terms, investment declined for most type s of buildings over the first two months of 
the year.  One exception is spending related to petroleum refining (a subcategory of the 
manufacturing sector), which has continued to increase.  However, trade reports have 
indicated that some renovations of petroleum refineries that were already under way have 
been canceled or delayed recently, resulting, in  part, from the plunge in energy prices in 
the second half of last year.  The dramatic drop in energy prices has also led to less 
investment in drilling and mining structures.  Real spending on these structures flattened 
out in the fourth quarter of 2008 after eight years of substantial increases, and the latest 
data on drilling activity suggest that investment in this sector dropped steeply in the first 
few months of this year. 
Outside of energy-related construction, the in dicators of nonresiden tial investment have 
deteriorated further.  Vacanc y rates moved higher in the firs t quarter, the architectural 
billings index remained low in March, and declines in nonres idential construction 
employment have steepened.  In addition, cr edit markets for commercial real estate 
remain quite strained:  The market for CMBS is closed, bank le nding for commercial 
construction contracted in the first quarter, and the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey suggested that financing for new pr ojects has become even more difficult to 
obtain.  However, the proportion of banks that  reported tightening their standards on CRE 
loans fell back in April.

Business Inventories 
Despite the sizable cuts in production recorded  in recent quarters, inventories remained 
excessive early this year.  As a result, firm s have continued their efforts to reduce their 
stocks of inventories:  The level of real nonfarm inventorie s fell about $31 billion in the 
last quarter of 2008, and motor vehicle inventorie s fell very sharply in the first quarter of 
this year. Outside of motor vehicles, the BEA estimates that real inventories rose in 
January, but book-value data point to a decline in February.  Furtherm ore, in the staff’s 
flow-of-goods (FOG) system, real inventories ar e estimated to have declined sharply in 
February and March.  Nevertheless, both th e Census and FOG systems measures of 
months’ supply remain elevated.  Finally, th e Institute for Supply Management’s index of 
customers’ inventories indicates that a majo rity of respondents continue to view their 
customers’ inventory positions as too high in March, although the overhang appears to be a bit less severe than it was, on av erage, in late 2008 and early 2009.  
Federal Government Sector 
The federal unified budget deficit deteriorated further in Ma rch, as receipts fell sharply 
and total outlays soared relative to a year earlier.  As a result, the deficit for the 
12 months ending in March totaled $1.1 trillion, compared with $200 billion for the 
previous 12 months.  The total deficit include d $384 billion in outlays related to TARP, 
capital injections into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and deposit insurance. 
Federal outlays during the Janua ry-March period, ex cluding major financial transactions 
and adjusting for payment-timing shifts, were 9 percent higher than in the same period a 
year earlier.  Transfer pa yments were 17 percent higher,  largely reflecting increased 
unemployment insurance benef its (due to both higher unemployment and the extended 
benefits program) and a jump in Medicaid pa yments to the states  as a result of the 
stimulus legislation.  Defense outlays, which had been rising at a double-digit pace over 
the past year, were only 5 percent above the ye ar-earlier level.  Real defense spending in 
the national income accounts probably fell in the first quarter, relative to the fourth 
quarter of last year. Federal receipts in the January-March peri od were 18 percent lower than in the same 
period last year.  Relative to the year-earlier period, individu al income and payroll taxes 
fell 12 percent, as individual income taxes fell  sharply and payroll taxes only edged down 
slightly.  Over the same period, net corpor ate income taxes fell 84 percent because of 
both the falloff in corporate profits and the partial-expensing provi sion.  Gross corporate 
income tax payments in March, which incl ude final settlements on 2008 income, fell

31 percent, and daily data indicate that Ap ril payments, which are mostly the first 
quarterly installment on 2009 income , dropped even more sharply. 
The House and Senate passed budget resolu tions that propose neither substantial 
additional spending nor signi ficant changes to tax laws over 2009-10, although they 
propose that most of the expiring tax cuts be extended after 2010.  The congressional 
leadership plans to hammer out a conference agreement on the budget resolution and to 
begin work on a fiscal 2009 supplemental sp ending bill for the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, disaster re lief, and other items. 
State and Local Government Sector 
Incoming data suggest that conditions in th e state and local sector are continuing to 
deteriorate.  Employment fell an average of  6,000 per month in the first quarter following 
job losses averaging 3,000 per month in the four th quarter.  Job losses in the first quarter 
were concentrated in local governments outside of education. The value of nominal 
construction spending put in place averaged $275 billion at an annual rate in January and 
February, a sharp drop-off from the $287 bill ion spent on construction in the fourth 
quarter. 
According to the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of State and Local Government 
Tax Revenue , the rise in tax revenues in both the st ate and local sectors has continued to 
slow during 2008.  Total state revenues were  just 1¼ percent above  their year-earlier 
level, while local tax reve nues were only up about 3½ percent; in comparison, revenue 
increases were 4¼ percent for states and 6½ percent for lo calities in 2007.  
Prices  
Overall consumer prices moved up, on balance,  in the first quarter  after having fallen 
sharply in the fourth quarter, as energy prices rebounded some what from their late-year 
plunge and core goods prices picked up.  We esti mate that total PCE prices were flat in 
March after rising 0.3 percent in both January  and February and that, for the third 
consecutive month, core PCE pri ces rose 0.2 percent last month.8  Taking a somewhat 
longer perspective, the 12-month percent chan ges in both total and core PCE prices, at 
0.7 percent and 1.9 percent respect ively, were noticeably below those of a year ago.  In 
addition, prices for goods at earlier stages of production have continued to move down. 
                                                 
8 PCE prices for March are staff estimates based on data from the CPI and PPI releases.

After having posted increases in January and February, PCE energy prices fell 
3¼ percent in March, reflecting si zable declines in all energy categories.  Current survey 
data suggest that retail gasoline prices decrea sed further in April despite the increase in 
crude oil prices since February.  Retail dema nd for gasoline has apparently been weak, 
which has boosted inventories and squeezed gasoline margins well below their average over the past five years. 
Consumer food prices edged down over the firs t three months of this year, as last 
autumn’s sharp drop in spot prices of crops  and livestock has continued to pass through 
to the retail level.  Over the three months ending in March, food prices decreased at an 
annual rate of ¼ percent—following a 4 percent rate of increase over the previous three 
months.
  So far this year, spot prices of crops a ppear to have stabili zed at levels well 
below their 2008 peaks. We estimate that PCE prices excluding food and energy rose at an annual rate of 
2½ percent over the three months ending in March, up from the especially low annual 
rate of increase of ¼ percent over the preced ing three months.  Relative to the fourth 
quarter, the acceleration in core prices in the first three months of this year was fairly 
widespread across categories.  However, th e pickup was particularly steep among goods, 
which had seen large price declines at the end of 2008, likely associat ed with aggressive 
discounting in reaction to weak demand and ex cess inventories.  Prices of nonmarket 
services have also risen more rapidly in recent  months after being soft  late last year.  In 
addition, the increase in March reflected a sizable jump in cigarette prices as tobacco 
companies raised retail prices in advance of the federal tax increase that took effect on 
April 1. Median near-term inflation expectations in the preliminary Reuters/Michigan survey took 
an unexpected bounce up to 3 percent in earl y April.  Those near-term views did not 
appear to influence longer-term expectations:  The median expectation for inflation over 
the next 5 to 10 years was 2.7 percent in April,  only a touch above th e March level and at 
the low end of the range seen over the past fe w years.  As is discussed in the “Domestic 
Financial Developments” section, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations 
continue to be difficult to interpret. 
Toward the end of 2008, prices at earlier st ages of processing retreated considerably, 
reflecting weaker global demand and the associat ed steep declines in the prices of energy 
and other raw materials.  So far this year, the PPI for core intermediate materials has 
continued to decline but at a noticeably slower pace.  Over the first three months of the

24 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008.  Meanwhile, since the March Greenbook, 
commodity prices have increased:  Both the Journal of Commerce index of industrial

Nonetheless, these indexes remain far below their year-earlier values.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1 Overview 
Conditions in financial markets showed so me limited signs of improvement over the 
intermeeting period, as risk premiums na rrowed and the functioning of short-term 
funding markets improved a bit.  Still, un certainty about the economic outlook and the 
upcoming release of bank stress-test result s continued to weigh heavily on market 
sentiment.  Nominal Treasury yields dropped on the FOMC’s March announcement, but 
reversed most of those declin es over the remainder of the period amid a reduction in safe-
haven demands and a perceived improvement in the economic outlook.  Broad stock-price indexes gained about 10 percent over the intermeeting period, and bank stock prices 
rose even more, boosted by news that some large banks were profitable in the first 
quarter.  Spreads on BBB-rated and specula tive-grade corporate bonds narrowed about 
40 and 280 basis points, respectively, but remained very high by historical standards.  Rates on conforming fixed-rate mortgages declined over the interm eeting period, perhaps 
reflecting, in part, the consid erable expansion of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS 
purchase program. 
 
Net debt financing by nonfinancial fi
rms slowed further in April, and household 
borrowing appears to have been lackluster in  the first quarter.  Corporate and household 
credit quality continued to deteriorate in recent months.  In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, siza ble fractions of banks again reported 
having tightened lending sta ndards and terms on all major loan categories (see appendix 
to this section).  
 
Policy Expectations and Interest R
ates 
Yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities dropped about 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, on the FOMC’s March 18 announcement that the Federal Reserve 
would begin purchasing up to $300 billion of long-term Treasury securities and would 
substantially expand its purcha ses of agency debt and agen cy MBS.  Since then, rates 
have moved up, likely reflecting a reduction in safe haven demands and a perceived 
improvement in the economic outlook.  On balance, yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities ended the intermee ting period down 14 and 20 basis points, 
respectively.  Uncertainty about long-term Treasury rates also dropped in the wake of the FOMC announcement but was little changed, on net, over the remainder of the period. 
 
Implied rates on Eurodollar futures contracts beyond year-end fell considerably after the 
March FOMC announcem
ent, as investors repor tedly reacted to the statement that the 
federal funds rate would likely remain at exceptionally low levels  “for an extended

period.”  Futures quotes reversed these decl ines over the remainder of the period and 
again suggest that market participants expect  the federal funds rate to trade within the 
current target range throu gh the third quarter of 2009.  However, readings on policy 
expectations from these markets continued to  be complicated by possible shifts in term 
premiums and other technical factors.  A bout one-half of the respondents to the April 
survey of primary dealers by the New York Fe d’s Domestic Trading Desk did not expect 
an increase in the federal funds rate ta rget until 2011—roughly the same as in the 
previous survey.  
 
Five-year inflation comp
ensation as measured  from TIPS yields rose 25 basis points, on 
net, to 0.4 percent over the intermeeting period.  The increase likely reflects, in part, 
recent improvements in TIPS liquidity.  Five-year inflation compensation five years ahead declined 12 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Near-term inflation 
expectations from the Reuters/University of  Michigan survey increased 100 basis points 
in early April, and long-term inflation e xpectations in the survey rose slightly. 
 
Federal Reserve Purchase Progra
ms and Facilities 
Assets on the Federal Reserve balance sheet  increased $120 billion over the intermeeting 
period because of a sharp rise in securities  held outright.  Purc hases over the period 
included about $50 billion in nominal Treasu ry coupon securities and $1.5 billion of 
TIPS.  The bulk of the nominal Treasury secu rities purchased were  on-the-run or first-
off-the-run issues with maturities ranging from  2 to 10 years.  Federal Reserve holdings 
of agency MBS and agency debt rose $138 billion and $17 billion, respectively.  
 
The first two subscription periods fo
r the Te rm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF) were held during the intermeeting pe riod and resulted in $6.4 billion of credit 
extensions collateralized by auto and credit card  ABS.  Of late, inve stors have reportedly 
become more hesitant to participate in th e TALF and some other programs because of 
concerns about political pressures and the po ssibility of restrictions on their hiring and 
compensation practices.  On net, credit extended under the vari ous Federal Reserve 
liquidity programs and other facilities decreased about $100 billion over the intermeeting 
period, mostly reflecting declines in primary credit outstanding and foreign central-bank 
liquidity swaps, as pressures in funding markets eased somewhat.   
 
On April 6, the Federal Reserve announced that  it had authorized foreign currency swap 
lines with four foreign central banks.  Th ese arrangem

through October 30, 2009, would allow the Federal Reserve to provide foreign currency 
liquidity to U.S. financial institutions. 
 
Financial Institutions and Markets 
Stock prices of banking organizations rose  28 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, as investor con
cerns about the condition of financial institutions appeared to 
diminish somewhat on news that some large banks were profitable in  the first quarter.  
CDS spreads for bank holding companies edged down, on net, despite continued 
uncertainty about the upcoming release of th e stress-test results.  Stock prices of 
insurance companies also rose noticeably over the period, likely reflecting speculation 
that the insurance industry mi ght receive TARP funding.   
 
On April 1, the FDIC extended its Temporary Liquidity Gua
rantee Program, which will 
now be available for new issuance through Oc tober 31 of this year and will provide 
coverage though the end of 2012.  At the same time, the FDIC raised guarantee fees for 
some issues.  Over the intermeeting period, financial firms issued an additional  $26 billion in guaranteed debt, and spreads of FDIC-guaranteed bonds to comparable-
maturity Treasury securities generally declined.   
 
Liquidity in the CDS market reportedly wa s poor early in the interm
eeting period, as 
market participants anticipated significan t changes to contract designs meant to 
standardize CDS and facilitate  a central clearinghouse.  These changes, which were 
implemented on April 8, passed without signifi cant market disruptio ns, and liquidity is 
said to have returned to recent norms. 
  
Short-Term Funding Markets 
Conditions in short-term funding ma
rkets improved somewhat over the intermeeting 
period.  In interbank markets, Libor fixings and spreads over overnig ht index swap (OIS) 
rates edged down in recent weeks, although Libor fixings beyond the one-month maturity 
remained elevated.  Spreads on A2/P2-ra ted commercial paper and AA-rated asset-
backed commercial paper declined a bit, on net, and are currently at the low end of their 
respective ranges over the pa st year.  Functioning of the market for repurchase 
agreements (repos) continued to improve, as  bid-asked spreads and haircuts on most 
collateral either narrowed or held stea dy, although repo volumes remained low.  
Consistent with steady or improving conditions in the term repo market, all seven 
intermeeting-period auctions under the TSLF  were undersubscribed.  The Schedule 1

that financing of Schedule 1–e ligible assets was cheaper in the private market.     
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock-price indexes rose about 10 perc ent, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
reportedly buoyed by announcem
ents of policy measures to improve credit markets and 
clean up banks’ balance sheets, and perhaps al so by some reduction in concerns about the 
economic outlook.  Financial stocks outperfor med broader markets, boosted by positive 
first-quarter earnings reports from a few major firms.  The spread between the forward 
trend earnings-price ratio for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real long-run 
Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equ ity risk premium—narrowed during the 
intermeeting period but remained very high by historical standards.  Option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index declined notic eably but remained very elevated relative 
to historic norms. 
 
On net, yields on BBB-rated and speculat ive-grade corporate bonds declined about 
60 and 300 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period.  As a result, spreads 
of yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds ove r those on com
parable-maturity Treasury 
securities declined about 40 basis points, while spreads on speculative-grade bonds 
narrowed about 280 basis points.  Even so, corporate bond spreads remained extremely 
high by historical standards.  Measures of bi d-asked spreads in the secondary market for 
high-yield corporate bonds improved somewhat, while corresponding measures for 
investment-grade bonds hovered at moderately elevated levels. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With about 100 earnings reports for S&P 500 fi rm
s in hand and analyst forecasts for the 
rest, first-quarter operating earnings per sh are are estimated to have been about  
40 percent lower than year-earlier levels, with  earnings per share for nonfinancial firms 
down a bit less.  Revisions to year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were substantially 
negative for the month ending in mid-March but noticeably less so than in the month 
ending in mid-February. 
 
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued 
to deteriorate over the past 
few months.  In the fourth quarter, the av erage leverage ratio of nonfinancial firms 
increased further, although the aggregate liquid-asset ratio also rose.  The pace of 
Moody’s downgrades of nonfinancial corporat e bonds was substantia l in February, and 
upgrades virtually ceased.  In March, the expected year-ahead default rate estimated by

Moody’s KMV remained extremely high, and th e six-month trailing bond-default rate 
dropped but remained near its peak le vels in the previous two recessions. 
 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial  corporations has been so lid in April but well below 
its outsized pace in the first quarter.  Inve stme
nt-grade bonds have continued to make up 
the bulk of issuance, although speculative-grade bond issuance has picked up a bit in 
April from muted levels in the first quarte r.  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding 
has partially rebounded in April from a drop in  the first quarter, while C&I loans have 
continued to contract.  Overall, net de bt financing by nonfinancial firms from bonds, 
commercial paper, and C&I loans ha s declined further in April. 
 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial fi rms, both initial and seasoned offerings, 
has remained weak in April.  Equity retire
ments in the fourth quarter slowed, as share 
repurchases declined substantially.  Data on merger activity and announcements of new 
share repurchase programs suggest that equity  retirements ebbed further in the first 
quarter.   
 
In contrast, gross equity issuance by financia l firms picked up in April, boosted by one 
large deal.  Financial firm
s issued bonds at a moderate pace, including debt issued under 
the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guaran tee Program as well as bonds without 
guarantees. 
 
Commercial Real Estat
e 
Credit markets for commercial real estate cont inued to show consider able strain in the 
first quarter.  The CMBS market stayed s hut, and commercial mortgages held by banks 
contracted further.  Sales of commercial real estate remain ed extremely sluggish in recent 
months.  Commercial real estate prices dr opped again in January, and preliminary data 
point to further declines in February and March.  Delinquency rates on securitized 
commercial mortgages shot up further in Ma rch, and major rating agencies downgraded 
large swaths of the junior AAA and lower-rated tranches of CMBS in recent weeks.  
Prices on senior AAA-rated commercial mortgage CDS indexes increased, on net, over the intermeeting period, reportedly as investors came to expect that highly rated CMBS 
would become eligible for the TALF.

Household Finance 
Interest rates on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages declined to 4.8 percent over 
the intermeeting period, perhaps reflecting, in part, the cons iderable expansion of the 
Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchase pr ogram.  Spreads of rates on conforming 
fixed-rate mortgages to long-term Treasury yiel ds narrowed to their lowest levels in more 
than a year.  Offer rates on nonconforming jumb o loans fell slightly but continued to be 
well above rates on conforming loans. 
  
Issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs increased in F
ebruary, as they securitized 
a spate of mortgages that were refinan ced in late 2008.  MBS issuance by Ginnie Mae 
continued apace, while the private MBS ma rket remained shuttered.  The Federal 
Housing Finance Agency index of existing hom e prices posted a decl ine of 6 percent over 
the year ending in January, while the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city index dropped 19 percent 
over the same period.  Falling home prices and the contracting economy continued to 
boost mortgage delinquency rates through February. 
 
Changes in consumer loan rates were m
ixed over the intermeeting period.  Rates on 
variable-rate credit cards we re about unchanged.   Rates on new auto loans at banks 
ticked up, while those on new auto loans extended through dealerships declined 
5 percentage points, likely because of increased financing incentives.  A significant decline in spreads on consumer ABS since the beginning of the year reportedly reflects, 
in part, the TALF eligibili ty of most 2009 issuance. 
      
Outstanding nonrevolv
ing consumer credit in creased slightly in February because of 
modest growth in auto loans, but revolvi ng consumer debt continued to contract.  
Consumer credit quality deteriorated further in recent months.  In the fourth quarter, the 
delinquency rate on nonrevolving loans at commercial banks topped its highest level in the previous recession.  In February, the deli nquency rate on credit cards in securitized 
pools increased again, while the delinquency rate on auto loans at captive finance 
companies was little changed at an elevated level.   
 
Long-term mutual funds experienced net rede mptions in F
ebruary and March, led by net 
outflows from equity funds amid volatile stoc k prices.  However, all major categories of 
long-term funds attracted net in flows in early April, and in  recent weeks, junk bond funds 
saw particularly heavy inflows.

Treasury Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury c onducted auctions for 2- through 10-year 
nominal coupon securities tota ling $158 billion and for 10-y ear TIPS totaling $6 billion.  
Auction results were mixed, perhaps reflecting the volume of i ssuance; the 5-year 
nominal issue, in particular, attracted a rela tively weak bid-to-cover ratio.  Indicators of 
foreign participation in Treasury au ctions continued to trend upward. 
 
The functioning of Treasury ma
rkets show ed some signs of recovery over the 
intermeeting period.  Premiums paid for on-th e-run Treasury securities fell, average bid-
asked spreads for Treasury notes were relatively stable near their pre- crisis levels, pricing 
errors from staff yield curve models decr eased for both nominal Treasury and TIPS 
securities, and conditions in Treasury-repo markets improved somewhat.  Still, daily 
Treasury trading volumes remained low.  
 
State and Local Government Finance Gross issuance of long-term  municipal bonds remained solid in April, but the 
com
position of new issues continued to be unusually skewed toward higher-rated 
borrowers.  Short-term issuance has been weak, about in line with typical seasonal 
patterns.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds declined, on net, and ratios of municipal 
bond yields to those on comparab le-maturity Treasury securities narrowed slightly but 
remained high by historical standards. 
 
Money and Bank Credit M2 expanded at an annual rate  of about 11 percent in March, as rapid growth in liquid 
deposits, the largest component of M2, was likely fueled by further reallocations by 
households toward safer assets.  Retail m oney m
arket funds and small time deposits 
contracted modestly.  Currency increased briskly in March, bol stered by elevated foreign 
demand.  The monetary base expanded rapi dly over the intermeeting period, boosted by 
increases in reserves due to the Fede ral Reserve’s asset purchase programs.  
 
Commercial bank credit shrank at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in March, as a decline in 
loans—am
id generally weaker demand and tighter lending standards—was only partly 
offset by increased holdings of securities.  C&I loans declined shar ply in March, and the 
runoff continued into early April.  In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the 
net fraction of respondents that indicated they  had tightened standards and terms for C&I 
loans was elevated but down somewhat from the January survey.  More than one-half of

respondents in the survey also saw a furthe r weakening in demand for such loans.   
Commercial real estate loans on bank bala nce sheets declined modestly in March and 
early April. 
 
In terms of loans to households, residential m
ortgages on bank balance sheets were flat in 
March, held down by record sales of single-fa mily mortgages from banks to the GSEs.  
In contrast, revolving home equity lines of  credit (HELOCs) expanded at a robust pace 
despite reports in the April Senior Loan O fficer Opinion Survey that banks had, on net, 
continued tightening standards for new HELOCs  and trimming the size of existing lines.  
On-balance-sheet holdings of consumer loans shrank 10 percent in March, mostly 
because of securitizations, including one  by an institution that had announced its 
intention to participate in the TALF. 
Appendix 
III-A-1 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
 
The April 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey
 on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and households  over the past three 
months.  The survey also included two sets of special questions:  The first set asked banks about 
their expectations for delinquencies and charge-o ffs on existing loans to business and households; 
the second set queried banks about international trade finance.  This appendix is based on responses from 53 domestic banks and 23 U.S.  branches and agencies of foreign banks.
1 
 
In the April surve
y, the net fractions of responde nts that reported having tightened their business 
lending policies over the previous three months—while staying very elevated—edged down for the second consecutive survey.  In contrast, somewh at larger net percentages of domestic banks 
reported having tightened credit standards on residential mortgages than in the January survey. The net percentage of domestic respondents that  reported having tightened their lending policies 
on credit card loans remained about unchanged from the January survey, while the net fraction that reported having tightened their policies on ot her consumer loans fell.  Respondents indicated 
that demand for loans from both businesses and households continued to weaken for nearly all types of loans over the survey period, an exception being demand for prime mortgages, a 
category of loans that registered an increase in demand for the first time since the survey began to track prime mortgages separately in April 2007.   
 
In response to the special questions on the outlo ok for loan qualit
y, a significant majority of 
banks reported that credit quality for all types of  loans was likely to deteriorate over the year 
assuming the economy progresses according to consensus forecasts.  In response to the special questions on international trade finance, the majo rity of domestic institutions that provide such 
credit and a substantial fraction of foreign ins titutions reported having tightened standards over 
the past six months. 
 
Lending to Businesses 
Questions on commercial 
and industrial lending .  About 40 percent of domestic respondents, 
on net, reported tightening their credit standard s on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans to 
firms of all sizes over the past three months, down from around 65 percent in the January survey.  
On balance, domestic banks have  reported tightening their credit standards on C&I loans to large 
and middle-market firms for eight consecutive su rveys and to small firms for ten consecutive 
surveys.  Although the latest net fractions—about 40 percent—are still very elevated, the April survey, nonetheless, marks the first time sin ce January 2008 that the proportions of banks 
reporting such tightening fell below 50 percent.  Similarly, the net fractions of domestic

respondents that reported tightening various te rms on C&I loans over the past three months 
remained elevated but were slightly lower than those reported in the January survey.  Specifically, 
about 80 percent of domestic banks, on balance, indicated they had increased spreads of loan 
rates over their cost of funds for C&I loans to large and middle-market firms, compared with 
around 95 percent in January.  About 75 percent of  domestic respondents indicated that they had 
increased such spreads for C&I lo ans to small firms, down from about 90 percent in January.  A 
significant majority of banks also reported havi ng charged higher premiums on riskier loans and 
having increased the costs of credit lines over the survey period. 
 
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also tightened their business lending stance further over the past three months.  About 30 percent of  foreign banks, on net, reported tightening credit 
standards for C&I loans, compared with 65 per cent in January.  As was the case with their 
domestic counterparts, significant fractions of fo reign banks further tightened various terms on 
C&I loans, though these fractions were somewhat lower than in January.  On balance, over 65 percent of foreign respondents reported an in crease in premiums charged on riskier loans and 
in the cost of credit lines and about 60 percent of  foreign banks reported an increase in spreads of 
loan rates over their cost of funds. 
 
Large m
ajorities of both domestic and foreign ba nks reported less favorable or more uncertain 
economic outlook, worsening of industry-specific problems, and reduced tolerance for risk as 
important reasons for the tightening credit sta ndards and terms on C&I loans.  A substantial 
majority of foreign respondents also indicated that an increase in defaults by borrowers in public debt markets, decreased liquidity in the secondary  market for business loans, and deterioration in 
their banks’ expected capital position were impor tant reasons for the change in C&I lending 
policies over the survey period.   
 
On balance, about 60 percent of d
omestic banks  reported a further weakening of demand for C&I 
loans from firms of all sizes over the past three months, similar to the fraction reported in the 
January survey.  In contrast, foreign banks, on net, saw little change in demand over the survey period, compared with about 25 percent that reported weaker demand in the January survey. 
 
All foreign respondents and 37 
of the 38 domestic banks that saw weaker demand for C&I loans 
over the past three months indicated that a d ecrease in their customers’ needs to finance 
investment in plant or equipment was an important reasons for the change in loan demand.  Substantial majorities of the domestic institutions that had experienced such weaker demand also 
pointed to decreases in their customers’ needs to finance inventories, accounts receivables, and 
mergers and acquisitions.  In addition, about 35 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported that inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased during the survey period, a 
fraction similar to that in the January survey.  In contrast, only about 5 percent of foreign

Questions on commercial real estate lending .  About 65 percent of domestic banks, on net, 
reported tightening their lending standards on comme rcial real estate (CRE) loans over the past 
three months, compared to about 80 percent in the January survey.  On balance, domestic banks 
have been tightening credit standards on CRE lo ans for 14 consecutive surveys, and the April 
survey marks the first time the net fraction of banks reporting such tightening fell below 
70 percent since October 2007.  About 35 percent of foreign branches and agencies also reported 
tightening their lending standards on CRE loans over the survey period.  The demand for CRE loans weakened further at survey respondents ove r the past three months.  About 65 percent of 
domestic banks, on balance, reporte d weaker demand for CRE loans, the highest net fraction so 
reporting since the survey began tracking demand for CRE loans in April 1995.  In contrast, the net fraction of foreign banks that reported a decrease in demand for CRE loans was about 35 percent, somewhat smaller than in the January survey. 
     
Lending to Households 
Questions on residential real estate lending .  Somewhat larger fractions of domestic 
respondents reported having tightened their lending standards on prime and nontraditional 
residential mortgages in the April survey than in the January survey.  About 50 percent of 
domestic respondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages over the past three months, and about 65 percent of the 25 banks that originated 
nontraditional residential mortgage loans over the survey period reported having tightened their 
lending standards on such loans.  About 35 percent of domestic respondents saw stronger 
demand, on net, for prime residential mortgage loans over the past three months, a substantial change from the roughly 10 percent that repor ted weaker demand in the January survey.  
However, the level of mortgage refinancing h as increased noticeably over the survey period, and 
the responses to this question are highly correla ted with such activity; even though banks are 
asked to abstract from mortgage refinancing in answering this question, it may be difficult for 
them to do so.  About 10 percent of responde nts reportedly experienced weaker demand for 
nontraditional mortgage loans over past three m onths—a substantially lower proportion than in 
the January survey.  Only two banks reported making subprime mortgage loans over the same period. 
 
On net, about 50 percent of
 domestic respondents,  down from roughly 60 percent in the January 
survey, noted that they had tightened their lending standards for approving applications for revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) over the past three months.  Regarding demand, about 30 percent of domestic banks, on net, re ported weaker demand for HELOCs over the past 
three months, slightly more than the fraction that had reported weaker demand in the January 
survey.  
 
Questions on consumer lending
.  Large fractions of domestic banks again reported a tightening 
of standards and terms on both credit card and othe r consumer loans over the past three months.  
Nearly 60 percent of respondents indicated that they had tightened lending standards on credit

card loans, about the same as in the January survey.  About 50 percent of respondents reported 
tightening standards on other consumer loans, down from 60 percent in the January survey.  Turning to loan terms, about 50 percent of r espondents reported having reduced the extent to 
which credit card accounts were granted to cust omers who did not meet their bank’s credit-
scoring thresholds, and a similar fraction repor ted pulling back from granting other kinds of 
consumer loans to such customers.  Roughly 55 percent of the respondents reported having raised 
minimum required credit scores on credit card accounts over the past three months, a somewhat higher proportion than in the January survey.  About 45 percent of respondents reported having 
raised scores on consumer loans other than credit cards, and about 65 percent of banks indicated 
that they had lowered credit limits to either new or existing credit card customers, up from the 45 percent that had reported doing so in the January survey.  In contrast, only about 5 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had b ecome less willing to make consumer installment 
loans over the past three months, down from 15 percent in the January survey and 45 percent late last year.  Regarding demand, about 20 percent of respondents, on net, indicated that they had 
experienced weaker demand for consumer loans of all types over the past three months, down 
substantially from the fraction so reporting in the January survey. 
 
Questions on existing credit lines.  The April survey repeated a special question from the 
January survey that queried banks on how they had changed over the past three months the sizes 
of credit lines for existing customers for a number of account types.  Regarding existing accounts 
for businesses, roughly 55 percent of domestic res pondents, on balance, reported a decrease in the 
limits on CRE accounts, slightly lower than in the January survey.  About 55 percent of respondents indicated a decrease in the limits on credit lines extended to financial firms, up slightly from the January survey.  About 30 percent indicated a decrease in credit limits on business credit card accounts, about the same as in the previous survey, and roughly 40 percent noted a decrease in the size of C&I credit lines, up significantly from the January survey.  On net, a large fraction of foreign banks also decreased li mits on credit lines extended to financial firms, 
CRE credit lines, and C&I credit lines.  Regarding existing accounts for households, about 40 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported having reduced the sizes of existing HELOCs, 
about the same as in the January survey, and a pproximately 50 percent reported having trimmed 
existing consumer credit card account limits, up from 35 percent in the January survey. 
 
Special Questions on the Outlook for Loan Quality in 2009
 
A set of special questions asked banks about thei r expectations for delinquencies and charge-offs 
on loans to businesses and households in 2009,  under the assumption that economic activity 
progresses in line with consensus forecasts.  The vast majority of domestic and foreign respondents indicated that they expect deteriora tion in credit quality for all types of business and 
household loans.  For each major category of lo ans considered in the survey, more than  
70 percent of respondents, on net, reported that the qu ality of their bank’s loan portfolio is likely 
to deteriorate this year, with more than 90 percent of domestic respondents reporting that loan quality is likely to deteriorate for nontraditional mortgages, credit card loans, and CRE loans. 
III-A-9 
Special Questions on International Trade Finance  
A final set of special questions queried both  domestic and foreign respondents about their 
provision of international trade finance (trade credit), which may consist of letters of credit 
guaranteeing payment, overdraft facilities, and ot her mechanisms for facilitating trade.  About 
65 percent of domestic and 80 percent of forei gn respondents reported providing such credit.  
About 60 percent of those domestic respondents and nearly 45 percent of those foreign 
respondents who provided such finance reported ti ghtening standards or terms over the past six 
months.  More than 80 percent of domestic banks  that reported having tightened standards or 
terms cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook abroad, increased concern about 
foreign country risk, worsening industry-specific problems, reduced tolerance for risk, and a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook in the United States as reasons for the tightening.  
All of the eight foreign banks that reported tight ening their standards and terms on international 
trade finance cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook in the United States and abroad and an increase in concern about forei gn country risk as important reasons for the 
tightening.  On net, about 70 percent of domestic respondents and about 10 percent of foreign respondents reportedly experienced weaker demand for trade credit over the past six months.

Trade in Goods and Services  
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed sharply in February to $26 billion from a 
revised $36.2 billion in January.  The narrowing of the deficit was mainly driven by a sharp decline in imports, although a rise in exports also contributed.  February’s trade deficit was the narrowest since November 1999. 
  
 
Following steep declines in previous months, the value of exports of goods and services rose 1.6 percent in February.  About one- half of this increase was accounted for by a 
sizable gain in exports of consumer goods, which in turn reflected a surge in exports of pharmaceuticals products.  However, most other categories of exports also moved up.  Exports of capital goods increased despite a modest decline in exports of aircraft.  
Exports of automotive products i ncreased after  a steep drop in January.  In contrast, 
exports of services declined.

IV-4 
 
 
    
 
 The average value of exports in January and February decreased about 37 p ercent at an 
annual rate, as all major categories of exports moved down.  The decrease in exports of 
industrial supplies reflected lower prices and volumes, while the decrease in exports of automotive products reflected significant production cutbacks impl emented by motor 
vehicle producers.  
The value of imports of goods and services fell  5.1 percent in February, with all major 
categories displaying substantial declines.  The decrease in imports of industrial supplies 
partly reflected lower prices for thes e goods.  For oil, however, the decline in imports was 
driven by lower volumes as prices moved up slightly.  The decline in imports of consumer goods was importantly driven by lower imports of toys and sporting goods, likely reflecting production disruptio ns in China related to the Lunar New Year.        
The average value of imports in January and February declined about 51 percent at an 
annual rate after  a 49 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 2008.  About one -third of 
the decline reflected a fall in the value of oil imports, mostly on account of lower prices. 
All other major categories of imports also declined sharply. 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   Prices of core imports fell 0.5 percent in March , with prices declining  
across all major subcatego ries.  Prices for foods and nonfuel industrial supplies fell about 
1 percent.  Prices for consumer goods and capital goods excluding computers and 
semiconductors fell about 0.5 percent, while automotive product prices declined a modest 0.2 percent.  
As measured by the B ureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), core import prices fell 11  percent 
at an annual rate in the first quarter, as prices declined in all major sub categories except 
automotive products.  The main contributors to the overall price decline were foods and nonfuel industrial supplies, whose prices fell 10 percent and 35 percent, respectively.  Finished goods prices fell ¾ percent, largely on the back of a 1½ percent fall in consumer goods prices. 
Oil.  
 The BLS price index of imported oil rose 10½ percent in March, marking the 
second consecutive monthly increase after a nearly 70 percent drop since July of last 
year.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil also increased in 
March, ris ing 20 percent to an average of $48 per barrel for the month as a whole.  Since 
IV-5 
 
 that time,  the spot price of WTI has remained at about that level , closing on April 21 at 
$46.51 per barrel.   
Exports.  Prices of exported core goods fell 0.7 percent in March, led by a 3.5 percent 
drop in the price of agricultural products.  Prices of non- agricultural industrial supplies 
fell 0.9 percent, and prices of consumer goods dropped 0.5 percent.  The prices of automotive products and capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors rose slightly.  
In the BLS data, core export prices  fell 10¾ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, 
as the prices of material -intensive goods continued to decline sharply.  The prices of 
agricultural products and non- agricultur al industrial supplies fell 11½ percent and 
28¾ percent, respectively.  Within finished goods, the prices of consumer goods declined 1½ percent, while prices of capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors and 
of automotive products rose 4¼ percent  and ½ percent, respectively.

  U.S. Current Account  
The U.S. current account deficit was $531 billion at an annual rate in the fourth  quarter of 
2008, $194 billion narrower than in the third quarter (revised) and the smallest deficit 
since the fourth quarter of 2003.  The narrowing resulted primarily from a decrease in the deficit on goods, as the recession and falling commodity prices have pushed down imports more than exports.  In addition, the surplus on investment income increased, as profits earned  on foreign direct investment in the United States declined by more than 
those on U.S. direct investment abroad, and the general decline in interest rates reduced the payments on the U.S. net portfolio liability position.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
S
ince the  March Greenbook, we have received balance of payments data for the fourth 
quarter of 2008, Treasury data on U.S. international financial transactions for February, 
 
.  These data suggest that in the first quarter of 2009 
foreign banks reduced their reliance on official sources for dollar funding, replacing it 
with private sources.  This is in sharp contrast to the heavy borrowing from offic ial 
sources recorded in the second half of 2008.  These data also indicate that there was substantial demand for Treasury securities in February and March, but demand for other domestic and foreign securities was extremely weak.   
Foreign official inflows picked up in February after several months of weakness (see line 1 of the table “Summary of U.S. International Transactions”).  Strong Treasury acquisitions, , were somewhat offset by sales of agency 
securities by G -10 and OPEC countries (see the bottom panels of the figure “Foreign 
Official Financial Inflows through February 2009”).  Unlike earlier months in which sales of agency securities were likely linked to flight -to-quality concerns, more recent 
sales are likely in response to a narrowing in the spread between GSE debt and Treasury 
bonds in January and February.   
 
.  
Foreign banks appear to have been successful in their efforts to replace official sources of dollar funding with private sources.  Drawings on central bank liquidity swap facilities contracted moderately in February after a sizable contraction in January.   This decrease 
generated significant official inflows as Federal Reserve deposit claims at partner central banks (included in line 2) decreased.  European-owned banks likely replaced these dollars with borrowing from their U.S. subsidiaries, consistent wi th the fairly large net 
banking outflows shown in line 3.   
Foreign private investors sought the safety of Treasury securities (line 4a) in February, 
and showed limited interest in other types of U.S. securities (see the top panels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through February 2009”).  Sales of agency securities by private foreigners continued through February but at a slower pace (line 4b).  Small net sales of U.S. corporate bonds and stocks (line 4c and 4d) continued despite strong issuance of  U.S. corporate debt in European markets.   
   
 
 

IV-10 
 
 
 After a brief upward tick in January related to a very strong month for foreign bond 
issuance, demand for foreign securities by U.S. residents fell back to near zero in February (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through February 2009”).   
Turning to the fourth-quarter balance of payments data, U.S. direct investment outflows 
(line 6) were healthy, as U.S. parents injected a sizable amount of new equity capital into their European finance affiliates.  Total foreign direct investment flows into the United States (line 7) were also strong; however, these flows include $52 billion for the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by the Belgian firm InBev.  Excluding this unusually large acqui sition, equity flows were weak and there were intercompany debt outflows.  
There were additional outflows in reinvested earnings, as losses by U.S. affiliates reduced their stocks of cumulated retained earnings.   
There was an unusually large net outflow associated with U.S. nonbanking concerns 
(included in line 10) in the fourth quarter, as SIVs and other nonbank financial intermediaries increased their claims on their foreign affiliates.  This was the first recorded outflow through these institutions since the second quarter of 2007.   
Estimated foreign acquisitions of U.S. currency (a financial inflow) jumped to a record 
$30 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 (line 9).  Demand for U.S. currency was widespread, but especially strong in countries that have traditionally turned to dollars in times of financial or political instability.

 Foreign Financial Markets 
Stock markets around the world have risen substantially since the time of the last 
Greenbook amidst a general improvement in investor sentiment, and boosted by some reports of better- than-expected performance from financial firms in the United States and 
Europe.  The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx and FTSE 100 indexes soared 15½ and 7½ percent, 
respectively, alongside the TOPIX index, which increased 15 percent.  In the euro area and the United Kingdom banking sector indexes gained over 45 percent.  In the United Kingdom, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered Bank reported a strong start to the year.  Additionally, Ba rclays announced that it had passed the stress test of the 
United Kingdom’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, and HSBC raised $19 billion in the largest-ever U.K. rights issue.  In Japan, financial shares rose, but less sharply, amid emerging concerns about the profitability and capital quality of some of its major banks.   
Pressures in interbank funding markets seem to have eased over the period.  Spreads 
between euro Libor and OIS rates narrowed by about 32 basis points, and sterling Libor to OIS spreads decreased similarly.  
In line with the rally in equity prices, bond yields have risen, on net, in most major foreign economies.  These moves in yields occurred despite the many central -bank 
actions over the period to loosen monetary policy, reportedly on reduced risk aversion, signs of moderation in the decline of economic activity, and excess supply concerns.  Since the time of the March Greenbook, both the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England (BOE) have begun to implement previously announced unconventional monetary policy measures.  The BOE has so far purchased close to £30 billion in assets as part of its Asset Purchase Program.  During its most recent Monetary Policy Council meeting, the BOE voted to continue with the £75 billion program.  The Bank of Japan expanded its regular purchases of Japanese government bonds to a larger- than-expected 
1.8 trillion yen per month, and it announced that it will expand its eligible collateral to include municipal debt.  In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) surprised markets on April 2 by reducing its main refinancing rate by a less -than-expected 25 basis points, 
to 1.25 percent, and deferred a decision regarding any new policy tools to its policy meeting in May.   
The dollar has depreciated against most other major currencies in an environment of s
eemingly increased investor risk appetite.  The major currencies index declined 
2 percent, with the dollar depreciating more than 4 percent against sterling and 
IV-15 
 
 
 1¼ percent against the eu ro.  The dollar fell sharply on the days after the March FOMC 
announcement and the smaller- than-expected rate cut by the ECB in early April but 
subsequently retraced some of these moves.  The dollar was flat against the yen over the 
period.    
Consistent with an improvement in investor sentiment towards emerging market 
economies, the dollar fell around 4 percent against the currencies of our other important trading partners.  Since the previous Greenbook, the Mexican peso has notably risen 12¾ percent agai nst the dollar.  The Mexican peso gained after Mexico announced it 
would activate its $30 billion swap line with the Federal Reserve; the Banco de Mexico sold a- less-than-offered $3.2 billion in term funds in its first auction.  The announcement 
that Mexic o would be the first country to sign up for the IMF’s recently established 
Flexible Credit Line also boosted the peso.  Poland and Colombia subsequently applied for the new facility.  Despite being broadly lower against emerging market currencies, the 
dollar was little changed against the Chinese renminbi.  A number of countries, including 
Russia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are believed to have intervened in foreign exchange markets to restrain upward pressures on their currencies.  
Numerous emerging market countries have further eased monetary policy, often by 
sharply lowering their policy rates.  IMF loan packages for Romania and Serbia, as well as a potential package for Turkey, have led to a substantial decrease in the credit default swap premiums for these countries.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Economic conditions continued to worsen in the advanced foreign economies in the first 
quarter.  Industrial production through February continued its steep decline, employment dropped sharply, and retail sales were weak or falling.  However, late first- quarter 
indicators, particularly the purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for all of the major economies, have begun to move upward, suggesting some moderation in the pace of output declines going forward.   
Consumer price inflation performance across the advanced foreign economies has been 
mixed since the last Greenbook:  Headline inflation has continued to fall in the euro area and held at around zero in Japan, but it has ticked up in the United Kingdom and Canada, in part reflecting the noticeable weakening in the currencies of these countries late last year.  
Central banks in the advanced foreign economies continued to ease monetary conditions in the intermeeting p eriod.  The Bank of Canada (BOC) and European Central Bank 
(ECB) both cut policy rates ¼ percentage point, and the Bank of England (BOE) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) further expanded asset purchases as part of their quantitative easing programs. 
IV-22 
IV-23 
 
 
 
 
 In Japan, i ndicators for first -quarter activity growth are bleak and suggest a second 
consecutive double-digit drop.  Industrial production plunged more than 9 percent in 
February after three months of sizable falls.  The index is now at its level of the early 
1980s.  Real exports have fallen 40 percent over the past six months, although the 
monthly declines have slowed with exports flat in March and down 3.5 percent in Febru ary.  Real imports rose slightly in March but are down 20 percent over the last three 
months.  In addition, the Tankan business sentiment survey plunged to a record low in the first quarter.  In a solitary bright note, private machinery orders excluding volatile elements rose 1.4 percent in February, although total orders fell more than 7 percent.   
The deterioration in the employment situation surged in the first quarter, with the job 
openings- to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openi ngs relative to the 
number of officially registered job seekers) dropping a record amount to a level of 0.59 in February.  Real wages fell 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in February.  The 
unemployment rate moved up to 4.4 percent.  
Consistent with t he weak labor market, indicators for the household sector are poor.  
After a brief respite in November, household expenditures resumed their downward 
trajectory in December and January.  The monthly index of real consumption fell at an annual rate of more than 6 percent over the first two months of the first quarter.  Housing starts fell 9.5 percent in February and are down more than 20 percent over the past six months.  New car registrations declined 13.5 percent in the first quarter. 
Japanese consumer price s were unchanged over the 12 months ending in February, 
leaving this 12-month measure of inflation sharply below the peak of 2.3 percent reached 
last July.  Excluding food and energy prices, 12-month consumer price inflation was  -0.1 percent in Februar y.   
The Bank of Japan left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting period and expanded purchases of commercial paper , corporate bonds, 
equities,  and government bonds.  On the fiscal front, political infighting appears to be 
slowing the implementation of the fiscal stimulus packages announced earlier this year.  Nonetheless, Prime Minister Aso announced a new fiscal package on April 10 of about ¥15 trillion, about 3 percent of GDP.  The staff estimates that this package contains about ¥5 trillion in new spending, bringing total effective stimulus to nearly 2 percent of GDP.   
IV-24 
 
IV-25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Recent indicators in the euro area  continue to point to significant weakness, although 
some tentative signs of moderation in the pace of contraction have emerged.  Industrial production declined 2½ percent in January and again in February.  The average level of retail sales for January and February w as slightly below that of the fourth quarter.  After a 
large decline in January, exports rebounded somewhat in February, driven by strong increases to the United States, Latin America, and ASEAN countries.  Imports continued to decline in February.  The eu ro-area unemployment rate increased to 8.5  percent in 
February.  Business and consumer sentiment indicators fell further through March, reaching record lows, but expectations six months forward improved.  PMIs, despite remaining well into contractionary te rritory,  stabilized in March .   
Twelve -month headline inflation in March was 0.6 percent, down from 1.2 percent in 
February .  Excluding energy and unprocessed food, inflation honed down to 1.5 percent.  
Twelve -month energy price inflation in March was neg ative 8.1 percent, down from t he 
peak of 17 percent in July. 
The ECB reduced its main policy rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent at its April meeting, 
a smaller cut than had been expected by markets .  ECB President Trichet signaled that, 
given the deteri oration in economic activity in the euro area, further monetary policy 
easing is likely.  He also suggested that unconventional policy measures would be 
announced at the May meeting. 
Since the last Greenbook, several countries adopted further measures to support their 
banking sectors.  On March 29, the Spanish government stated that it would inject capital into Caja de Ahorros Castilla -La Mancha (Spain’s twelfth -largest savings bank) and take 
over management.  On April 7, the Irish government announced the creation of a National Asset Management Agency  (NAMA), which is expected to  take €80 to 
€90 billion in property loans off banks’ balance sheets.  On April 9, the German government unveiled plans for nationalizing troubled mortgage lender Hypo Real Estate Holding.

 In the United Kingdom,  incoming data suggest that output continued to contract at a 
rapid pace in the first quarter.  Industrial production completed a full year of monthly 
contractions in February, standing 14 percent belo w its year -earlier level.  Large declines 
were recorded in the production of consumer durables — in particular motor vehicles and capital goods.  The Labor Force Survey and the claims- based measures of the 
unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent in January and 4.5 percent in March, respectively.  The volume of retail sales fell 1.9 percent in February but remained above its fourth-quarter average.  
Forward -looking indicators are consistent with a moderation in the pace of economic 
contraction in the current quarter.  PMI readings improved in March, although they remained solidly in contractionary territory.  Consumer confidence rose for a second consecutive month, although it remained near a survey low, but business confidence slid further.  Overall lending co nditions appear to be easing.  According to the BOE’s Credit 
Conditions Survey, a majority of U.K. lenders interviewed in March expected an improvement in the availability of corporate and secured household credit in the second quarter.  
The 12-month change in the CPI  ticked up to 3.1 percent in February, triggering the 
writing of a public letter by the Governor of the BOE detailing why inflation had exceeded its 2  percent target by more than 1 full percentage point .  Headline inflation 
then fell to 2.9 per cent in March.  Wage inflation eased in January, with the 12-month 
change in average weekly earnings including bonuses falling to 0.2 percent.  However, manufacturing unit labor costs rose sharply over that period because of a steep fall in productivity.  According to Nationwide and Halifax, two major U.K. lenders, house prices in March stood 20 percent below their fall 2007 peak. 
The Monetary Policy Committee of the BOE left its main policy rate unchanged at 
0.5 percent at its April meeting.  The Committe e also voted to continue its asset purchase 
program financed by the issuance of central -bank reserves.  Between the launch of the 
program on March 5, and the Committee’s meeting on April 9, t he BOE had acquired 
more than  £26 billion of asset s, with gilts a ccounting for the vast majority (£25 billion ) of 
purchases.  The Committee expected that it would take another two months to complete its £75 billion program.

 Incoming data in Canada for the first quarter are largely negative.  Monthly GDP fell 
0.7 percent in January after a 1  percent decline in December.  Employment was down 
significantly, and the unemployment rate rose to 8 percent in March.  These numbers 
alone suggest a steep decline for first-quarter GDP.  In addition, weak data from the housing market, with building permits down sharply in both January and February, are consistent with poor economic performance in the first quarter.  Manufacturing shipments and new orders both fell almost 6½ percent in January, and wholesale sales were down 4 percent.  However, there were several glimmers of hope that the pace of deterioration might not be increasing, including a January gain of 1.8 percent for retail trade and a February rebound in motor vehicle production.  Real imports stabilized in February and exports showed surprising strength, although the average levels of both in January and February were sharply below their fourth- quarter averages.  
Twelve -month headline inflation in March was 1.0 percent, down from 1.3 percent in 
February.  Core inflation was 1.3 percent in both months.  Average hourly earnings continued to increase, rising at a twelve-month rate of 4.8 percent in January.  
On April 21, the Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent 
and announced its intention to keep rates at this level until the end of the second quarter of 2010.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries  
There were tentative signs in the incoming data for the first quarter that the pace of 
decline in economic activity may be starting to abate in emerging market economies (EMEs).  In particular, conditions in China improved in the first quarter after fiscal 
stimulus measures and steps to spur credit growth.  Consumer price inflation moved lower in most EMEs, with some countries such as China in deflation territory.  There are firme r indications that financial conditions in most emerging markets have improved 
since the time of the March Greenbook.  CDS premiums generally narrowed, stock 
market indexes surged, and the currencies of several countries retraced part of their 
earlier shar p declines.  The improvement in financial conditions suggests that investor 
sentiment toward EMEs is on the mend.
 
In Chi
na, real GDP grew 6½ percent in the first quarter, as fiscal stimulus appears to be 
contributing to an acceleration of economic activity.  After slowing  at the end of last 
year, fixed -asset investment rebounded in the first quarter, up a robust 29 percent from a 
year earlier.  The official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 52 in March, 
suggesting an expansion in manufacturing for t he first time since September.  Industrial 
production also jumped in March, with average production for the first quarter up almost 
8 percent from the fourth quarter.  In contrast, retail sales growth edged lower in the first 
quarter.  T he trade surplus na rrowed , as exports fell sharply whereas imports were 
relatively flat.  
Benchmark interest rates and banks’ reserve requirements have been on hold since the end of last year, but Chinese authorities have been encourag ing banks to increase lending.  
Consequently, loan growth has continued to rise, with outstanding loans in March more than 17 percent above the December level.  It appears that many of these new loans are linked to the fiscal stimulus package.  The recent sharp rise in the Chinese stock market may also be providing a boost to consumer confidence ; the Shanghai composite stock 
index has risen almost 50 percent from its trough in November and is up nearly 20 percent  since the time of the March Greenbook.  Chinese consumer prices continued 
to fall an d were 1 ¼ percent below their year- earlier level in March .

 Incoming data from India  since the March Greenbook provide a mixed picture.  
Industrial production increased slightly in January and February after a modest decline in the fourth quarter.  Merc handise imports and exports continued to decline over the 
January -February period, leading to a small improvement in the trade deficit .  The closely 
watched wholesale price inflation has continued to fall and was almost flat in March on a 12-month basis.  Prompted by the weaker economy and abatement in inflationary pressures, the central bank reduced its policy rate a further 25 basis points at its mid -April 
meeting.  The month -long process for parliamentary elections began in mid-April.  The 
reigning Natio nal Congress Party is expected to retain its leading position in the coalition 
government.

In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs ),1 indicators of first -quarter economic 
activity were mixed.  In Singapore, the preliminary (unofficial) estimates indicate that 
real GDP contracted nearly 20 percent in the first quarter.  The contraction was broad -
based, led by a sizeable decline in manufacturing.  The construction sector was an exception, where housing and infrastructure projects supported activity.  In South Korea, by contrast, there are indications that the pace of decline in activity has moderated.  Industrial production was up in January and February, and business and consumer confidence improved.  Similarly, industrial production and exports orders were up in Taiwan.  Except for Hong Kong, exports generally rose from their depressed January levels, contributing to noticeable improvements in trade balances.  Reflecting the ongoing weakness in economic activity, unemployment climbed across the region.  
 
   
                                                
 
1 The NIEs are  Hong Kong, South Korea, Si ngapore, and Taiwan .  
Twel
ve-month consumer price inflation continued to decline, primarily reflecting 
significant slack in the economies .  After cutting interest rates in consecutive meetings to 
record lows, central banks in the region kept monetary policy on hold a t their most recent 
meetings.  Taiwan passed another fiscal stimulus package worth about $4.4 billion 
(1¼ percent of GDP).

2 The ASEAN-4  are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  Across the four major members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4),
 2 available indicators for Febr uary suggest that economic activity is 
beginning to stabilize , albeit at depressed levels in Thailand and Malaysia.  In February, 
exports in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand increased and industrial production rose .  
Consumer confidence indicators in March  were mixed across countries, with confidence 
up in Indonesia, but down in Thailand , which has been embroiled in severe domestic 
political tensions.  These tensions erupted in violence in mid-April, after protestors forced the cancellation of a major regio nal summit, prompting the government to impose a state 
of emergency.  The protestors are calling for new elections.  
Inflation in March continued to recede across the region.  With upward pressures on pr
ices abating , the central banks of Indonesia, Philippines,  and Thailand lowered their 
target policy rates by 25  basis points in April.

 In Mexico , incoming data have been mixed.  Over the January -February period, 
industrial production declined, but at a slower pace, driven in part by an uptick in auto 
production.  In the first 2 months of the quarter, exports declined further , albeit at a 
slower pace than the fourth  quarter of 2008.  T he trade deficit narrowed, as declines in 
imports exceeded declines in  exports.  Remittances showed some signs o f recovery.  
Manufacturing PMI moved up on balance in February and March but continued to indicate contraction.   
Headline consumer price inflation continued to ease, coming in at 6 percent on a 
12-month basis in March.  At each of its March  and April meet ings, the Bank of Mexico 
cut the policy rate 75 basis points, driven by abating pressures from exchange rate pass -
through and the recession.   In early April, Mexico began to draw on its swap line with the 
U.S. Federal Reserve that had been  established last  October.   In mid -April, t he IMF 
approved Mexico’s request to have access to a precautionary program of $47 billion through the Fund’s new Flexible Credit Line (FCL).  The FCL for Mexico is the largest financial arrangement ever approved by the Fund.

 In Brazil , data releases since the March Greenbook hint that activity may have started to 
bottom out .  The March PMI rose s lightly but remained in negative territory.  Industrial 
production rose over the first quarter through February, although it was st ill well below 
its level last September.  Retail sales were up a little over the January -February period.  
First-quarter auto production and sales  rebounded strongly from their steep declines late 
last year, boosted by tax reductions and the expansion in credit from government-owned 
banks.  Both exports and imports leveled off somewhat over February and March.  Headline and core inflation declined a bit in March . 
At their  March monetary policy meeting, central bank officials cut the target for the Selic 
rate by 150 basis points to 11¼ percent, as expected.  In late March, the government 
introduced a new deposit guarantee that was aimed at alleviating funding pressures of small banks.  T he government also introduced fiscal measures that were aimed at 
stimul ating residential investment and demand for consumer durables.

 In Argentina , indicators were mixed.  Industrial production contracted over the January-
February period, led by a fall in automotive production.  The trade surplus widened after 
having di pped in December, reflecting increased exports to regional tradin g partners and 
depressed imports.  In February, the government completed several local and foreign currency debt swaps in an attempt to ease its funding pressures .  Twelve -month consumer 
price inflation fell in the first quarter, reflecting weak domestic demand and  declines in 
commodity prices.  H owever, the reliability of the official inflation data remains 
questionable. 
In V
enezuela , the anecdotal evidence suggests that activity was weak  in the first quarter, 
despite very expansionary policies.  Reported inflation was 28 percent on a 12-month 
basis, but commentators question the reliability of these data.  In mid -April, the central 
bank reduced interest rates on its short- term certificate s of deposits; observers speculate 
that the move was aimed at inducing banks to hold more government debt.  The government has been indicating that it will issue more debt domestically .  In recent 
weeks, the Chavez government and the Chavez-controlled congress have taken several steps to further centralize power of the Executive.  Several opposition leaders are being investigated for corruption.

                     In Russia , fourth-quarter GDP contracted 7¼ percent  (a.r.), the largest decline since the 
1998 crisis.  In dicators were mixed in the first quarter, as construction showed some 
rebound but other indicators continued to suggest a contract ion.  Twelve -month inflation 
remained in the double digits, fueled by the pass- through from exchange rate 
depreciation.  Since March, the ruble has partially rebounded from its lows earlier this year.  In contrast to other major EMEs, the central bank had raised interest rates last year and early this year to defend the ruble.  Foreign exchange reserves , which had declined 
by over one-third from their peak of $600 billion in mid-2008, have been roughly stable over the past few weeks and stood at $385 billion in  mid-April.
