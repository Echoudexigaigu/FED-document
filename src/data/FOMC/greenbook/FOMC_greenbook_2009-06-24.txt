II-1 Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. The incoming data suggest that the economy  remains very weak, though declines in 
activity seem to be lessening.  To be sure, employment is still falling, and manufacturers 
have cut production further in response to excess inventories and soft demand.  But the 
reductions in employment and industrial pr oduction have slowed somewhat, consumer 
spending appears to be holding reasonably steady after a steep drop in  the second half of 
last year, and sales and constr uction of single-family homes seem to have flattened out.  
In addition, the recent declines in capital spending have been  less precipitous than those 
recorded earlier in the year.  Apart from a ta x-induced jump in tobacco prices, consumer 
price inflation has been fairly quiescent in  recent months, although the upturn in energy 
prices is likely to boost h eadline inflation in June. 
Labor Market Developments  
Labor market demand weakened further in Ma y, albeit less rapidly than earlier in the 
year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment  fell 338,000 last month following average 
declines of nearly 700,000 per month from  January to March and a drop of 600,000 in 
April.  May’s decline in employment was th e smallest since last September; with the 
notable exception of the manuf acturing sector, most industrie s reported a slower pace of 
job loss, and employment in nonbusiness servic es moved up for the first time since last 
summer. 
In addition to shedding jobs, firms have cut their labor input by shor tening hours worked:  
Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls 
dropped steeply from September to March but ha ve since flattened out near the low level 
of 33.1 hours.  Aggregate hours of producti on and nonsupervisory workers fell at an 
average pace of ½ percent per month in Apr il and May after falling ¾ percent per month, 
on average, over the preceding seven months. 
In the household survey, the unemployment rate  climbed further in May, jumping another 
½ percentage point, to 9.4 percent.  In addition, the fraction of workers who were 
working part time for economic reasons—althou gh flat over the past couple of months—
remained at an extremely elevated level.  The labor force participation rate moved up in 
May for a second consecutive month and was cl ose to where it was at the beginning of 
the recession.  The emergency unemployment insurance program that began last July has

1 The staff estimates that emergency benefits may currently be contributing about ½ percentage point to the 
levels of the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate. likely contributed to the rise in the unemploy ment rate and the resi liency in labor force 
participation by encouraging unemployed i ndividuals to stay in the labor force.1  In 
addition, the deterioration in household ba lance sheets may have caused some older 
workers to delay retirement and some s econdary workers to enter the labor force.  
Other indicators suggest continued weakne ss in labor demand.  The four-week moving 
average of initial claims for unemployment in surance has fallen back a little from its 
recent peak, but the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance benefits 
has continued to increase.  Layoff rates—as gauged by the percentage of short-term job 
losers in the household survey and the layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings 
and Labor Turnover Survey—stayed high in April and May, while measures of job 
vacancies remained low.  In addition, alternative measures of labor market slack—job availability as reported in the Conference Board Survey and hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey—remained at levels consistent with elevated slack. 
Regarding the forward-looking indicators of la bor market conditions, hiring plans in the 
NFIB and Manpower surveys have been about flat in recent months after two years of 
steep declines.  Households’ e xpectations of future labor market conditions have shown a 
more marked improvement.

The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an 
annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first quarter after having fallen at a 0.6 percent rate in the 
fourth quarter of last year.  On the whole, labor productivity has held up surprisingly well 
during the recession as firms have responded to the contraction in  aggregate demand by 
aggressively reducing labor input. 
Industrial Production 
Industrial production (IP) decreas ed 0.9 percent per month, on av erage, in April and May 
after average declines of 1.6 percent per month in the firs t quarter.  Manufacturing output 
fell at an average rate of ¾ percent per mont h in April and May, and the factory operating 
rate dipped further to 65.0 percent in May, yet another low for a series  that goes back to 
1948. 
The production of motor vehicles and parts fell  nearly 8 percent in May and subtracted 
about 0.3 percentage point from the rate of ch ange in total IP.  (The effect on production 
of the GM and Chrysler bankruptcies is di scussed in the motor vehicle section.)  
Elsewhere in transportation equipment, the pr oduction of commercial aircraft moved up 
1.1 percent in May.   
 
 
.2The 787 Dreamliner, which is a few years 
behind schedule, is expected to make its  first test flight late this month. 
In the high-tech sector, computer output fe ll 1.6 percent per month in April and May, on 
average, after having fallen at a similar p ace in the first quarter.  Business demand has 
been particularly weak; the paring of IT budgets  is reflected both in sharp declines in 
server sales and a lengthening of the PC replacement cycle.3  Output of communications 
equipment fell 0.7 percent, on average, in April and May; this decline is consistent with 
the contraction in capital expenditures at major telecommunications service providers in 
the first quarter. 
Further up the high-tech supply chain, near-t erm indicators of production have turned 
somewhat less negative, possibly reflecting a mild inventory restocking after months of 
drastic production cuts.  In Ap ril, orders for circuit board s rose sharply—albeit from a 
very low level—and outpaced shipments for the first time since early 2008.  Similarly,  
                                                 
2 In addition, United Airlines has requested proposals from both Boeing and Airbus for an order of up 
to 150 new aircraft, an investment valued at nearly $10 billion. 
3 A recent Gartner survey reported that IT budgets for 2009 were revised down further during the first 
quarter of this year.

global semiconductor sales climbed for the second consecutive month in April, and, over 
the three months ending in May, the real ou tput of semiconductors averaged monthly 
gains of 1.2 percent.  The outlook for semic onductors over the next few quarters has also 
improved slightly.  Indeed, several industry groups have updated their forecasts and no 
longer anticipate further declin es in the production of semi conductors in the second half 
of the year. 
The production of energy has declined each mont h this year.  In particular, the index for 
drilling and related support activity has plunge d more than 40 percent since December.  
The other major components of energy output—utilities, coal mining, and petroleum 
refining—are down so far this year, wh ile oil and gas extraction has edged up. 
Elsewhere in the industrial sector—that is, excluding motor ve hicles and parts, aircraft 
and parts, high-tech equipment, and energy—pr oduction declined in both April and May, 
though, on balance, at a slower pace than over the preceding five months.  After having 
decreased about ½ percent in April, the output of consumer goods edged up ¼ percent in 
May with gains in the produc tion of nondurable consumer g oods.  The output of business 
equipment decreased about 1¾ percent, on av erage, in April and May after monthly 
declines that averaged roughl y 2¾ percent in the first thr ee months of the year.  The 
declines in construction supp lies continued apace, although the primary source of the fall 
in production has shifted from supplies more closely related to residential construction to those more closely related to nonresidentia l construction activity.  Materials output 
contracted further in both April and May as  pronounced declines in durable materials 
continued. 
The available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity  suggest a more moderate 
pace of production declines in coming months.  Although the overall months’ supply of 
inventories remains elevated, sharp production cutbacks late last year and so far this year 
have allowed producers to stem the rise in stoc ks relative to sales.  Indeed, the diffusion 
index of three-month changes in months’ supp ly in the staff’s flow-of-goods system fell 
substantially over the past few months and now indicates that more industries have 
declining months’ supply than  have rising months’ supply. 
On the demand side, the ISM new orders diffusion index—a useful i ndicator of near-term 
factory activity—jumped 18 inde x points over the past thr ee months and edged above 50 
in May for the first time since November  2007.  In addition, the three-month moving 
average of the staff’s estimate of real adjust ed durable goods orders increased in April for 
the first time since mid-2008.  In contrast, despit e their moving up from the cyclical lows

reached earlier in the year, the various re gional new orders diffu sion indexes have, on 
average, remained below 50. 
Motor Vehicles  
Sales of light motor vehicles rose to an a nnual rate of 9.9 million units in May.  Most 
major automakers, including GM, which decl ared bankruptcy on J une 1, reported higher 
sales.  Sales at Chrysler, which declared  bankruptcy on April 30, moved sideways last 
month after plunging in April.  (For more information on the bankr uptcies, see the box 
“Recent Developments at Chrysler and General Motors” on II-12.)  Higher sales to retail 
customers more than accounted for the in crease in industry-wide sales in May. 
Consumers’ assessments of car-buying conditions  in the Reuters/University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers have improved markedly this year.  In general, the improvement 
has coincided with a large decrease in the percent of survey respondents reporting that 
credit is tight; this percenta ge has dropped sharply from the highs of last fall and is now 
back at typical historical le vels.  In early June, respondent s also mentioned lower prices 
and the availability of good deals as r easons for the favorable buying conditions.  
Correspondingly, the average value of light vehicle incentives ro se sharply at the end of 
last year and remained at a high level through early June.  Both Chrysler and GM have 
boosted incentives in hopes of propping up sales during their stays in bankruptcy; Ford 
has also launched a generous incentive progr am in an attempt to snatch market share 
from its Detroit rivals. 
Turning to light vehicle produc tion, the latest industry sche dules suggest that second-
quarter assemblies are running at an annual ra te of about 4½ million units—little changed 
from the historically low first-quarter rate —as the shutdowns at Chrysler and GM are 
being offset by modest increas es in production at most other automakers.  The pullback 
in production this year has re duced dealers’ stocks of do mestic light vehicles to 
extremely low levels, and the days’ supply fe ll from a peak of 101 days in February to 
just 73 days at the end of Ma y, quite close to the automakers ’ preferred target of 65 days. 
Looking ahead, initial industry schedules call fo r production to rise substantially in the 
third quarter to an annual rate of 7.1 million units.  More than one-half of this large jump 
in schedules reflects the planned resump tion of production at GM and Chrysler.  
However, other companies ―in particular, Ford and Toyota ―are also planning 
significant production increases ne xt quarter.  Whether automake rs will be able to ramp 
up production this rapidly is uncertain.  Indee d, initial industry plans have tended to be 
overly optimistic in recent quarters. 
II-12 
 
Recent Developments at Chrysler and General Motors  
On April 30, Chrysler filed for bankruptcy 
and immediately ceased production at all of 
its U.S. facilities.  On June 9, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Fiat, an Italian automaker, to take a 20 percent stake in a “New Chrysler” composed of the 
company’s viable assets.  The agreement 
with Fiat was signed on June 10.  The other stakeholders are the United Auto Workers retiree healthcare trust fund (55 percent) 
and the U.S. and Canadian governments.   
 
Chrysler recei
ved permission to close 
roughly 800 of its approximately 3,200 dealerships and to cut its production 
capacity 25 percent.  Fiat will provide the production technology and engineering assistance needed to produce smaller, more 
fuel-efficient cars.    
 
On
 June 1, GM filed for bankruptcy but did 
not shutter any of its production facilities.  
However, many of its plants were already 
scheduled to be closed through early July to 
trim bloated inventories.   
 
Under current plans, the U.S. government 
will convert about $40 billion of its 
anticipated $50 billion in total loans into a 60 percent stake in a “New GM.”  Smaller shares will go to the Canadian government 
(12.5 percent), the UAW retiree healthcare 
trust fund (17.5 percent), and GM’s bondholders (10 percent).  The latter two parties will also receive warrants.   
 
GM pla
ns to cut its domestic light vehicle 
production capacity from 3.2 million units to 2 million in 2010 and to 1.83 million in 2014.  
Thus far, 14 U.S. factories have been 
identified for closure by the end of 2010, 
including two assembly plants that will be shuttered and two that will be placed on “standby” should vehicle demand increase.   
 
GM
’s U.S. hourly employment will be 
reduced from about 61,000 in 2008 to 40,000 in 2010; salaried employment will also be 
reduced.  The company’s dealer network will 
be cut to approximately 3,600 dealers by the end of 2010 from about 6,300 dealers today.  
 
Finally, the number of GM’s U.S. brands will  
be cut in half, with the restructured company composed of Chevy, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac.  GM plans to sell the Saturn, HUMMER, and Saab brands, but no deals 
have been finalized.  The Pontiac brand will 
be wound down by the end of 2010.

4 A large drop in personal income tax payments more  than accounted for the increase in real DPI in the 
first quarter.  The first-quarter drop in tax payments reflected both the low level of this spring’s net final 
payments on 2008 liabilities—which the BEA spreads over the four quarters of this ye ar in its estimates of 
personal tax payments—and the ongoing weakness in personal (pretax) income. Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at an annual ra te of 1½ percent in 
the first quarter after having fallen sharply in the second half of 2008, and spending has 
held reasonably steady so far in the second quart er.  On the basis of the latest retail sales 
data, we estimate that re al expenditures on goods other than motor vehicles rose 
0.3 percent in May and have changed little, on net, since the turn of the year.  Real 
outlays on services were reported to have ri sen 0.2 percent in Apr il, a pickup from the 
average monthly gain seen over the first three months of the year. 
The fundamental determinants of consumer de mand appear to have improved a bit lately.  
Despite the ongoing decline in employment, real  disposable personal income (DPI) rose 
at an annual rate of 6½ percen t in the first quarter, and it pos ted another sizable gain in 
April as various provisions of the Ameri can Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(ARRA) boosted transfer paymen ts and reduced personal taxes.4  In addition, equity 
prices have recorded substantial gains in recent weeks, thus offsetting a small portion of 
the prior wealth declines.  Meas ures of consumer sentiment, while still at levels typically 
seen during recessions, have improved markedly from the historical lows recorded around the turn of the year. 
Housing  
On balance, the incoming data suggest th at housing activity may have bottomed out.  
Single-family housing starts ticked up in May to an annual rate  of 400,000 units after 
having moved roughly sideways  at around 360,000 units between January and April.  
Moreover, adjusted permit issuance for si ngle-family houses—a useful month-ahead 
indicator of starts—has been a little above the leve l of starts since January, which hints 
that further modest improvements in single-fa mily activity may be in store for coming 
months.  In contrast, activity in the much smaller multifamily sector has fallen 
significantly further this year after turni ng down in the second half of 2008.  The 
contraction in multifamily construction ove r the past year has reflected a sharp 
deterioration in the fundamentals in that sect or.  In particular, cr edit availability for 
multifamily construction projects has tightened appreciably, and prices of apartment 
buildings have fallen sharply after a sizable  net run-up over the preceding three years. 
The steep decline in the demand for new single-family houses also seems to have abated.  Sales of these homes have fluctuated in a narrow range around 350,000 units at an annual

rate since January,  
.  That 
said, the pace of new home sales is still ve ry low, and the months’ supply of new homes 
remains quite elevated relative to sales de spite a decline in th e stock of unsold new 
single-family homes to roughly one-half of its mid-2006 peak. 
Sales of existing single-family home s have been fairly stable sin ce late last year at a little 
more than 4 million units, and April’s 6¾ percent jump in pending sales agreements 
signals that existing home sales may turn upward in the coming months.  The relative 
stability of the resale market over this pe riod has coincided with a heightened proportion 
of transactions involving bank-owned and other distressed properties.  According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), sale s of distressed properties, which tend to 
occur at lower prices than sales of otherw ise-identical houses, have accounted for about 
45 percent of existing home sales so far this  year—roughly double their share of sales in 
early 2008.

According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, foreclosure starts jumped to a 
record high of 1.3 percent of all mortgages in the first quarter of 2009.  The upturn in 
foreclosure activity this year likely reflect s the expiration of some  of the moratoriums 
that had held down the initiation of foreclosure proceedings in the second half of 2008.  Despite the step-up in foreclosures, the NAR’s  measure of the stock of existing homes for 
sale has continued to trend down (both in ab solute terms and relative to sales) after 
having peaked in mid-2008.  Even so, existing-home inventories remain very high relative to sales.
6 
The apparent stabilization in housing demand seen  in recent months likely is due, in part, 
to the improvement in housing affordability that has resulted from  low mortgage rates 
and declining house prices.  Rates for c onforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages—
currently around 5.6 percent—have risen about 80 basis points si nce late April but remain 
below the levels seen over most of 2008.  Although the market for private-label nonprime mortgages remains closed, spreads between rates for jumbo and standard conforming 
loans have narrowed substantially in recent m onths (though they remain elevated relative  
                                                
5 Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate agents, many 
foreclosure-related sales are captured in these statistics because banks frequently hire real estate agents to 
sell repossessed properties.  
6 The NAR measure of existing-home inventories may overstate the actual overhang because it includes 
many houses that are still occupied by owners and re nters.  Using Census data from the Housing Vacancy 
Survey, the staff estimates that there were about 1.75 million vacant  single-family houses for sale in the 
first quarter, about 50 percent higher than the level that prevailed when home sales peaked in the summer 
of 2005.

7 The FHA has offered an alternative source of mortgage financing for some higher-risk borrowers, but the 
FHA’s relatively strict lending standards and higher costs suggest that such lending is likely to have 
replaced only a part of the reduction in credit from private sources.  to pre-crisis norms).7  Meanwhile, national house prices continue to head downward:  The 
repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance 
fell 10¼ percent over the 12 months ending in April, roughly the same as the decrease 
over the preceding 12 months.  Although thes e ongoing price declines continue to 
enhance affordability, they are probably al so deterring some potential buyers worried 
about purchasing in a falling market:  Eviden ce from the Reuters/Michigan survey and 
anecdotal reports suggest that  many households still expect prices to fall in the coming 
year, though the share of such households a ppears to have shrunk in recent months.  
Equipment and Software 
Real investment in equipment and software (E&S) is continuing to contract sharply; 
however, the decline in the second quarter appear s likely to be smaller than in the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.  Ou tlays on transportation equipment seem to 
be firming after an extended period of steep  declines, and the incoming data point to 
some moderation in the rate of decreas e in other major components of E&S. 
With regard to transportation equipment, sale s of medium and heavy trucks fell further, 
on net, in April and May, and the low level of  orders in recent months—which reportedly 
reflects the ongoing contractions in cons truction activity and industrial production—
points to continued near-term weakness in sales.  However, declines in business outlays 
on light motor vehicles appear to have abated :  Deliveries to rental car companies have 
been fluctuating in a narrow range since Fe bruary, and demand from other businesses has 
been moving sideways—albeit at a very low level.   In addition, the April figures on 
shipments of complete aircraft and internati onal trade, taken together, suggest an increase 
in domestic purchases of aircraft. 
Businesses apparently are continuing to cut their real outlays on hi gh-tech equipment and 
software, although the incoming information pr ovides differing signals on the speed of 
the decline.  This is especially true in the computer sector:  IP has continued to drop in 
recent months even as shipments from domestic producers have held fairly steady and 
imports have firmed a bit after plunging in th e second half of last year.  Shipments from 
producers of communications equipment fell in  April to a level a bout 3 percent below 
their first-quarter average.  Communications orders also de creased in April although they 
remained well above the lows seen at the start of the year.

8 Some of the recent strength in the energy-related s ectors likely reflects the reto oling of refineries to 
comply with more-stringent EPA regulations regarding the sulfur content of nonhighway diesel fuel, which 
are due to take effect in 2010.  In addition, a num ber of refineries are bein g expanded and refitted to 
accommodate equipment needed to process heavy crude oil from Canada (although many of these projects 
reportedly have been delayed or canceled in recent months).  Also, the construction of wind farms and 
other renewable energy generation facilities has stepped up , spurred, in part, by the relatively high cost of 
hydrocarbon fuels and a variety of tax incentives at the federal and state levels. Real spending on equipment outside of high-tech and transportation plummeted at an 
annual rate of 35 percent in the first quarter, with spending still dropping—though 
probably less steeply—in the cu rrent quarter.  Shipments declined 2½ percent in April, 
and although new orders have changed little, on net, since January, they remained well 
below shipments for major subcategories su ch as construction e quipment, industrial 
machinery, and metalworking machinery.  Shrinking backlogs of unfilled orders for these types of equipment imply further downward  pressure on shipments in coming months. 
On balance, the fundamental determinants of equipment and software investment remain weak.  Business output dropped shar ply in the first quarter, and th e user cost of capital is 
higher than it was a year ago.  In addition, credit remains ti ght; in the May NFIB survey, 
the share of small businesses reporting incr eased difficulty obtaining credit was the 
highest on record.  On a more positive not e, corporate bond yields and spreads over 
Treasury securities—though still elevated—have eased considerab ly in recent weeks.  In 
addition, monthly surveys of business conditions  and sentiment have generally been less 
downbeat recently than earl ier in the year, although the May update of the ISM 
semiannual forecast for 2009 indicated that only 8 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed, and 15 percent of nonmanufactur ing firms, plan to increase capital 
expenditures this year. 
Nonresidential Construction  
The recent data from the Census Bureau s uggest a substantial—and surprising—increase 
in outlays for nonresidential construction in March and April.  This uptick was 
concentrated in energy-relate d sectors—namely, the petrol eum refining subcomponent of 
manufacturing and all categor ies of power generation, transmission, and distribution.
8  
These energy-related sectors accounted fo r about 40 percent of nominal outlays on 
nonresidential buildings in April, up s ubstantially from about 22 percent in 2006. 
Outside the energy-related sectors, conditions  for nonresidential build ing remain dismal:  
Vacancy rates ascended further in the firs t quarter, the architectural billings index 
remains at a level consistent w ith steep spending declines for the rest of the year (despite 
having turned up of late), and the nonresident ial construction sector continues to shed 
workers.  In addition, responses to the Apr il Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on

9 In all, real nonfarm inventories fell at an annual rate of about $100 billion in the first quarter, but 
about two-thirds of the liquidation was in the motor vehicle sector. 
10 In the Monthly Treasury Statement for April, the Administration changed th e budget accounting for 
outlays associated with the TARP, putting all of them  on a net-present-value basis, taking into account 
assumptions about market risk.  Previously, equity purchases under this program were recorded on a cash-
flow basis in the monthly budget data, while loans and debt-related activities were accounted for on a present-value basis. Bank Lending Practices and reports in the late st Beige Book suggest that financing for 
new projects is becoming even more difficult to obtain, and Call Report data show that 
banks are paring back thei r portfolios of nonresiden tial construction loans. 
Real spending on drilling and mining structures  plummeted at an annual rate of nearly 
80 percent in the first quarter,  and continued sharp declines in footage drilled and the 
number of drilling rigs in ope ration point to another substan tial decline in spending in the 
current quarter.  Many factors appear to have discouraged explorati on activity, including 
the steep slide in natural gas and crude oil prices through the end of  last year and an 
apparent glut of new natural gas supplies fr om recently discovered fields in northern 
Louisiana and elsewhere. 
Business Inventories  
The sharp cuts in production so far this year are helping to reduce the level of inventories, 
though overhangs remain substantial.  Real nonfarm inventories excl uding motor vehicles 
fell at an annual rate of about  $30 billion in the first quarter,  and the book-value data for 
the manufacturing and trade sector in April s uggest that liquidation continued apace early 
in the second quarter.9  Nonetheless, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales 
(excluding motor vehicles) is still quite high.  And while the staff’s flow-of-goods 
inventory system also suggest s that inventories have rece ded, months’ supply for most 
major market groups (excluding motor vehicles a nd parts) remained elevated in May.  On 
the bright side, fewer than one-half of the supply managers surveyed by the ISM in April 
and May viewed their customers’ inventory positions as too high. Federal Government Sector 
The cumulative deficit in the federal unified budget has widened further in recent months 
as a result of the continued weak pace of economic activity and the budget costs 
associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
10  The deficit for the 12 months ending in May 
totaled $1.13 trillion, $800 billion more  than in the previous 12 months. 
Total federal revenues in Ap ril and May decreased more th an 27 percent relative to the 
same year-earlier period, refl ecting weak gains in nominal personal income, a likely drop

11 As expected, only a small portion of the funds targeted at infrastr ucture spending in the ARRA has 
been spent to date.  For example, the Department of Transportation reports that, as of June 5, 2009, only 
$175 million in transportation infrastructure stimulus funds had been spent. in capital gains realizations in 2008, and declin es in corporate profits.  In particular, final 
payments on individual tax liabilities for 2008—which are usually a large share of tax 
receipts in April and May—declined sharply re lative to their level of a year earlier.  
Meanwhile, withheld tax payments in Ap ril and May were reduced approximately 
$5 billion per month by the “Making Work Pa y” tax credit provision in the ARRA.  
Finally, corporate tax payments in April, wh ich mostly represent firms’ first quarterly 
payments on expected 2009 tax liabilities, we re substantially below payments in April 
2008. 
Federal outlays—excluding fina ncial transactions such as those related to the TARP—
increased 10 percent in April and May comp ared with the same year-earlier period.  
Spending associated with a number of provisions in the ARRA is estimated to have 
increased federal outlays about $38 billion in April and May relative to  a year earlier.  
Continued weak economic conditions contri buted to higher spending for low-income 
support programs, such as unemployment insura nce benefits, while outlays for defense, 
federal health programs, and Social Security we re also higher than a year earlier.  In 
contrast, net interest payments declined slightly compared with the same year-earlier period, as the reduction in Treasur y interest rates more than offset the rise in Treasury 
debt. 
A supplemental spending bill of $106 billion was passed by the House on June 16 and is 
awaiting final action by the Senate.  The bill pr ovides funding for the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, foreign aid, disa ster relief, and other items. 
State and Local Government Sector 
Real spending by state and local governments has remained weak.  Employment in the 
sector rose only 7,000 per month, on average,  in April and May after declining 6,000 per 
month, on average, in the first quarter of this year.  Based on data through April, 
construction spending appears to have rebounde d somewhat after having fallen steeply in 
late 2008 and early 2009.  However, we are cautious about attaching too much 
significance to the improvement given the volat ility of the data and the deteriorating 
fiscal condition of the sector.
11 
New reports from the National Conference of State Legislator s and the National 
Association of State Budget O fficers (NASBO) point to a sign ificant intensification of 
pressures on state and local budge ts.  Importantly, for the first 10 months of fiscal year

12 According to NASBO’s tabulations, governors’ budget proposals for fiscal 2010 include a net 
increase of $24 billion in taxes and fees as well as continued restraint on spending. 2009 (which ends on June 30 in most states), 29 states reported that collections for all 
major tax sources came in below year-earlier  levels, while 21 states indicated that 
personal tax collections had fallen more than  10 percent.  States have made some 
adjustments to spending to counter the shortf alls in revenue, but many are still dealing 
with significant gaps in thei r general fund budgets for fiscal 2009; they expect conditions 
to remain bleak in fiscal 2010 as well.12  California, for example, faces a budget shortfall 
of $24 billion—equal to roughly 25 percent of its annual general fund revenues—through 
the end of fiscal 2010 despite the enactment of  $40 billion of deficit-reducing measures 
last February. 
Prices  
Headline consumer prices turned back up ear ly this year after having been pushed down 
by the plunge in energy prices in late 2008.  Core inflation also picked up in the first two 
months of this year following the unusually low readings seen in the last part of 2008; 
over the past three months, however, core pri ces have posted smaller increases outside of 
a tax-induced jump in tobacco prices that boosted the readings for March and April.  
Based on our translation of the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index 
(PPI), we estimate that total and core PC E prices both edged up 0.1 percent in May.  
Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the 12-month change in total PCE prices was 
0.1 percent in May, 3½ percentage  points lower than a year ago, while core PCE inflation 
was 1.8 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from its year-earlier pace.  Meanwhile, 
survey measures of long-run inflation expecta tions have remained in the range that has 
prevailed over the past few years. 
We estimate that consumer energy prices  rose 0.3 percent in May after posting a 
2.4 percent decline in th e previous month.  Retail gasoline prices rose 3 percent in May, 
but this increase was partly offset by a 5¾ per cent drop in natural gas prices.  Survey data 
point to a much larger jump in gasoline prices so far in June; nonetheless, the rise in retail 
gasoline prices has not kept pace with the upturn  in crude oil prices over the past several 
months as gasoline margins have been s queezed.  Meanwhile, residential natural gas 
prices have tumbled as inventories ha ve risen to unseasonably high levels. 
Continued pass-through of last autumn’s sharp drop in livestoc k and crop prices, 
combined with weakness in consumer dema nd for food, has contributed to a leveling out 
in retail food prices this year  after a sizable increase in 2008.  In recent weeks, production 
uncertainty arising from unusually wet weather in major growing regions has made farm

13 Retail prices of tobacco products rose in March in  anticipation of the April 1 increase in the federal 
tobacco tax, and they increased further in April after the tax went into effect.  In total, the increase in prices 
of tobacco products appears to have been larger than the tax increase. 
14 With the jump in prices of to bacco products, the 12-month change in core market-based PCE prices, 
at an estimated 1.9 percent in May, was unchanged fr om a year earlier, whereas the core CPI decelerated 
0.5 percentage point over this period.  This differe nce stems largely from a deceleration in shelter costs 
over the past year:  Because housing services receive a larger weight in the CPI, a deceleration in these 
prices has a relatively larger effect on CPI inflation. prices quite volatile; on net, however, prices have risen only marginally since the April 
Greenbook and remain significan tly below their 2008 peaks. 
We estimate that PCE prices excluding food and energy rose at an annual rate of 
2.3 percent over the three months ending in May.   This rise in core prices was boosted 
significantly by back-to-back increases in prices of tobacco products in March and 
April.13  Excluding the increases in prices of tobacco products, the three-month change in 
core PCE prices was 1.3 percent in May, and the 12-month change was 1.5 percent.14 
After jumping to 2.8 percent in April, median  near-term inflation expectations in the 
Reuters/Michigan survey remained at that leve l in May and then rose to 3.1 percent in the 
preliminary June survey.  So far, measures of long-term inflation expectations have shown no sign of moving lower despite the considerable margin of labor- and product-
market slack present in the economy:  The me dian expectation for inflation over the next 
5 to 10 years from the Reuters/Michigan surv ey in early June was 3.1 percent, about the 
same as its average over 2008.  In addition, median long-term expected inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged up 0.1 percentage point in the second quarter. 
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of last year.  Commodity prices, which had moved higher over the first four months of 2009, have 
risen more sharply since the April Greenbook:  Both the Journal of Commerce  index of 
industrial material prices and the CRB index of spot industrial prices posted double-digit 
increases over this period.  Nevertheless, these prices remain much lower than their year-earlier levels. 
Labor Costs 
The incoming data on labor costs have been mixed.  Hourly compensation in the nonfarm 
business sector as measured in the Productivity  and Costs (P&C) releas e rose at an annual 
rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter and posted an increase of 4 percent over the year 
ending in the first quarter, similar to the av erage pace seen over the preceding several

15 The annual rate of increase of P&C hourly compensation in the fourth quarter of 2008 was revised down from 
5¼ percent to 4½ percent following the BEA’s incorporation of the state unemployment insurance data into its wage 
and salary estimates.  More-complet e estimates for the first quarter wi ll become available in August. years.15  Meanwhile, the employment cost index (ECI) for private-industry workers rose 
just 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in March, 1¼ percentage points less than the 
rise over the preceding 12 months.  The deceler ation in the ECI was about evenly spread 
across the wage and salary and benefits com ponents.  Much of the slowdown in benefits 
costs was in nonproduction bonuses, which fell 7 percent after rising 6 percent over the 
preceding year; the increase in employer c ontributions for health insurance—at 
4½ percent—was the same as over the preceding year. 
Turning to the current quarter, average hourly  earnings rose 0.1 per cent in both April and 
May.  Over the 12 months ending in May, this wage measure rose 3.1 percent, 
¾ percentage point less than over the preceding year.

Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets
Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1   
 
 Overview 
Conditions and sentiment in financial market s continued to show signs of improvement 
over the intermeeting period.  The results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program 
(SCAP) were positively received by fina ncial markets.  CDS spreads for banking 
organizations declined considerably, albeit to  still-elevated levels, and the institutions 
involved in the SCAP subsequently were able to issu e significant amounts of public 
equity and nonguaranteed debt.  The f unctioning of short-term funding markets 
improved, with Libor rates and Libor-OIS spread s declining over the period.  Broad stock 
price indexes increased, and spreads on corporate bonds continued to narrow.  
Meanwhile, nominal Treasury yields climbed steeply, apparently reflecting investors’ 
perceptions of an improved economic outlook, a reversal of flight-t o-quality flows, and 
technical factors related to the hedging of mortgage holdings.  TIPS data point to some 
increase in inflation risk pr emiums and inflation expectati ons as well.  Rates on 30-year 
conforming fixed-rate mortgages increased a bout in line with the jump in long-term 
Treasury yields. 
The volume of bond issuance and seasoned equity  offerings by nonfinancial corporations 
was robust in May, but outstanding bank loan s to households and nonfinancial businesses 
declined.  The available indicators suggest  that household and business credit quality 
continued to deteriorate, w ith delinquency rates on cr edit cards and on commercial 
mortgages now at their highest leve ls in more than a decade.   
Financial Institutions 
Market sentiment toward the financial se ctor improved over the intermeeting period, 
reflecting, in part, the release of the SCAP results for the nation’s 19 largest bank holding 
companies (BHCs) on May 7.  N early all the BHCs evaluate d had enough Tier 1 capital 
(of which more than $200 billion was previous ly issued capital from the government) to 
absorb the higher losses envisioned under the more hypothetica l adverse scenario; still, 
10 institutions were required to enhance their capital struct ure to put greater emphasis on 
common equity.  Guidelines for repaying gove rnment capital provided to the BHCs under 
the TARP were also announced in early June.  CDS spreads for banking organizations 
declined considerably over the intermeeting period, alt hough they remained well above 
historical norms.  Stock price indexes for the banking sector and the broader financial sectors jumped almost 15 percent.  
Since the announcement of the SC AP results, the 19 evaluated institutions have  raised or 
announced plans to raise around $70 billion in common equity through public offerings,

1 One condition for repaying TARP funds is that institutions demonstrate their ability to meet funding 
requirements without relying on the FDIC’s  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. conversion of preferred stock, a nd asset sales.  These offerings accounted for most of the 
record-high total financial equity issuance in May.  The evaluated BHCs have also issued 
roughly $10 billion of debt under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program 
and more than $25 billion in ot her debt, with considerable va riation across institutions in 
the rates paid on non-FDIC-guaranteed debt.1  On June 9, the Treasury announced that 10 
large financial institutions were eligible to repay the $68 billion in TA RP capital that they 
had received. 
Press reports during the inte rmeeting period indicated that  the Treasury would grant 
access to TARP funds to a number of insu rance companies.  Some of the named 
companies announced that they would not accep t such funds, while one major insurance 
company announced that it had obtained approva l to receive $3.4 billion in TARP funds.  
On the whole, stock price indexes of insurance companies rose over the intermeeting 
period. 
Short-Term Funding Markets 
Functioning in short-term funding markets generally improved over the intermeeting 
period.  Consistent with a reduction in con cerns about the financ ial condition of large 
banking institutions, Libor rates declined not iceably.  The one-month Libor-OIS spread 
narrowed to just above pre-crisis levels, and the three-month Libor-OIS spread—while 
still elevated—declined to a level not seen since earl y 2008.  Longer-term Libor-OIS 
spreads also narrowed but continued to be  elevated by historical standards.  
In the repurchase agreement (repo) market , bid-asked spreads for most types of 
transactions ticked down while haircuts we re little changed.  Reportedly, term repo 
volumes continued to be light but picked up slightly.  Since the April Greenbook, spreads 
on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-ra ted ABCP were little changed, on net, 
remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past 18 months. 
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserv e assets were about fl at at a little more 
than $2 trillion, with an increas e in securities held offset by a decline in credit supplied 
under credit and liquidity facilities.  The Federal Reserve a dded more than $250 billion to 
its portfolio of securities held outright.  Purchases of Treasury coupon securities 
accounted for about $90 billion of the increase; almost all of these purchases were

 nominal securities, with the bulk having maturities between 2 and 10 years.  In addition, 
the Federal Reserve purchased about $20 bi llion of agency debt and more than 
$150 billion of agency MBS.   
Consistent with the improvement in short-term funding markets, use of most Federal 
Reserve liquidity facilities declined.  Primary credit outstanding ebbed, and credit 
extended under the PDCF dwindled to zer o.  TAF credit declined as bid amounts 
submitted at auctions generally trended lower, although the number of banks submitting bids was little changed.  Bidding at TSLF au ctions continued to decline.  The CPFF saw 
the second major roll of commercial paper, with  less than one-half of this maturing paper 
reissued to the CPFF, in part because issuer s moved to longer-term sources of funds.   
During the intermeeting period, there were two TALF operations, which resulted in 
$22 billion in new TALF loans.  Most loans were secured by credit card or auto loan ABS.  Also during the intermeeting peri od, the Federal Reserve announced a further 
expansion of the collateral el igible to be pledged under th e TALF program to include 
newly issued and legacy CMBS, as well as insurance premium finance loans.  The Federal Reserve also authorized TALF loans with maturities of up to five years for loans to finance purchases of CMBS, ABS backed by student loans, and ABS backed by loans 
guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. 
Treasury Yields and Policy Expectations 
Futures quotes—combined with our standard assumptions about the term premium—now 
imply that the expected federal funds rate rises above the current target range around the 
end of this year; however, readings from th is market are likely somewhat distorted by 
widening term premiums.  No respondent to the primary dealer survey expects a rate 
increase this year.  
Over the intermeeting period, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased about 
60 basis points, while that on th e 2-year note rose about 30 ba sis points, with the largest 
increases occurring in late May and early June.  These moves were attributable to several 
factors, including investors’ perceptions of an improveme nt in the economic outlook, a 
reversal of flight-to-quality fl ows, a possible rise in inflati on expectations, and a rise in 
term premiums.  Term premiums appear to ha ve increased, in part, because investors sold 
long-duration assets as exposur e to mortgage prepayment ri sk dropped with a rise in 
mortgage rates; consistent w ith such hedging activity, 10-year  swap spreads jumped.  In 
addition, uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve would adju st its asset purchases in

 response to the increase in yields contributed to an increase in in terest rate volatility, 
which also likely pushed term premiums higher. 
Measures of TIPS-based infla tion compensation over the next  5 years and 5 to 10 years 
ahead increased about 80 and 8 basis points, respectively, and now stand close to the 
levels seen late last summer.  Special factors probably contributed to the widening in inflation compensation; in particular, the unwinding of safe-haven demands and 
increased mortgage-related hedging boosted nomina l yields relative to TIPS yields.  But 
inflation risk premiums and inflation expectations likely increased as well.  Indeed, survey measures of expected inflation have ticked up lately, and the largest moves in inflation compensation occurred on days of noticeable increases in oil prices. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes have risen about 7 percent, on net, since the April FOMC 
meeting, reflecting generally better-than-expected economic news and further declines in risk premiums.  The spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return 
over the next 10 years for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real 10-year Treasury yield—a rough gauge of the equity risk premium—narrowed noticeably but remained 
high by historical standards.  Option-im plied volatility on the S&P 500 index also 
declined but remained elevated. 
Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds declined  about 90 basis points, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, and those on speculativ e-grade corporate bonds declined about 
70 basis points.  As a result, spreads of BBB-rated and speculat ive grade corporate bond 
yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed about 150 and 
130 basis points, respectively.  Corporat e bond spreads have now reversed roughly 
one-half of the jump from mid-2007 to the end of last year, but their current levels are 
still at or above the peak levels poste d in 2002 following the previous recession.  
Estimates of bid-asked spreads in the seconda ry market for speculative-grade corporate 
bonds fell significantly to about their average levels in the few years before the summer 
of 2007, while those for investment-grade corporate bonds remained somewhat elevated. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Operating earnings per share in the first qua rter for S&P 500 firms as a whole were about 
32 percent below year-earlier levels, as were  profits for the nonfin ancial portion of the 
index.  Analysts’ current forecasts imply that  the pace of profit d eclines will moderate 
only a bit in the second quarter.  An index of  revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year-

 ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms was negative in the month ending in mid-May, but substantially less so than in the prior few months, with the index level for nonfinancial 
firms just a touch below zero.   
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial  firms continued to point to considerable 
stress.  The aggregate ratio of debt to asse ts for nonfinancial corporations rose a bit 
further in the first quarter and is now at it s highest level since 2001.  At the same time, 
nonfinancial corporations have boosted their hol dings of liquid assets as a share of total 
assets, in part because some corporations  held the proceeds of robust bond issuance in 
cash.  The pace at which Moody’s downgraded  nonfinancial corporate bonds slowed 
noticeably in April and May from its outsize d level in the first quarter but remained 
substantial.  Meanwhile, ratings upgrades cont inued to be modest.  In May, the six-month 
trailing bond default rate remained close to its peak levels in 1991 and 2002, and the 
expected year-ahead default frequency from Moody’s KMV remained extremely high by 
historical standards.  In addition, the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans moved up further in the first quarter to the middle of its historical range.   
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinanci al corporations was robust in May.  Investment-grade 
issuance rebounded from a lull in April.  Speculative-grade issuance was the highest 
since June 2007, but issuance of lower-rated speculative-grade bonds remained minimal.  
With decreasing bond yields, firms reportedly issued bonds to pay down bank loans, contributing to a further cont raction in C&I loans.  Net issuance of commercial paper 
turned positive in May, but the outstanding amount of paper is still down by roughly 
one-third since the start of the year.  Over all, last month, these sources of net debt 
financing by nonfinancial corporations boun ced back from their decline in April. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms from seasoned offerings surged in 
May to its highest level since October 2008, while initial public offerings remained 
muted.  In the first quarter, the pace of public  and private equity issuance was moderate, 
while equity retirements from cash-financed  mergers and estimated share repurchases 
declined.  As a result, net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was positive for the first time since 2002.

 Commercial Real Estate 
Commercial real estate mark ets have remained under considerable strain.  Outstanding 
commercial mortgage debt was roughly flat in  the first quarter, the weakest reading since 
1995.  Sales of commercial real  estate declined further in April and May, with the 
monthly volume now just a small fraction of th at seen in 2007.  Comm ercial real estate 
prices dropped again in the first quarter, le aving the price indexes down about 25 percent 
from their peaks in 2007.  Delinquency rates on both securitized commercial mortgages 
and commercial mortgages on existing properties at commercial banks have risen to their 
highest levels in more than a decade.  De linquency rates on constr uction loans at banks 
continued to escalate in the fi rst quarter from already elevat ed levels.  The inclusion of 
CMBS in the TALF program resulted initiall y in a narrowing of commercial mortgage 
CDS spreads; however, spreads have since widened as rating agencies have issued 
conflicting opinions regarding the credit quality of senior CMBS tranches. 
Household Finance 
Interest rates on 30-year conforming fixed-ra te mortgages jumped about 80 basis points 
over the intermeeting period, about in line with the rise in th e long-term Treasury yield.  
The increase left the conforming mortgage ra te above 5½ percent.  Issuance of MBS by 
the housing-related GSEs has increased in recent months, as the GSEs continued to 
securitize mortgages that were refinanced ear ly this year, and Fannie Mae securitized a 
portion of its portfolio of seasoned mortga ges.  MBS issuance by Ginnie Mae increased 
modestly in March and April, while the priv ate-label MBS market remained shuttered.  
After declining in the previous three quarters, outstanding residential mortgage debt was 
about flat in the first quarter .  Mortgage debt likely has continued to be restrained by 
weakness in housing activity, fa lling home prices, restrictive financing conditions for 
some types of borrowers, and elevated  charge-offs of defaulted loans. 
Home prices continued to decline in the first quarter: The Federal Housing Finance 
Agency home price index posted a decline of  7 percent over the year ending in March, 
while the LoanPerformance national index and the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city index 
dropped 12 percent and 19 percen t, respectively, over the same period.  The number of 
foreclosure starts increased sharply in the firs t quarter, in part owi ng to the expiration of 
various mortgage moratorium laws.  The increa se in foreclosure starts was particularly 
striking for prime loans; 2.5 percent of all outstanding prime loans are now in 
foreclosure, the highest reading since the series began in 1979.

 Conditions in the consumer ABS market improved noticeably.  Spreads on AAA-rated 
consumer ABS narrowed further over the inte rmeeting period and have now reversed a 
large fraction of the run-up from mid-2007 to their peaks at year-end 2008.  Issuance of 
consumer ABS continued to ramp up, led by TALF-financed issues.  Interest rates on 
new and used auto loans were little change d over the intermeeting period at levels well 
below those seen early this year, and interest rates on credit cards we re also about flat.  
Delinquency rates on all types of consumer loans have continued to  rise; however, the 
increase in credit card deli nquency rates has been particul arly pronounced over the past 
year, with most measures at their hi ghest levels in more than a decade. 
Reflecting a reduction in safe-haven demands , long-term mutual f unds, especially bond 
funds, attracted considerable inflows in Ap ril and May; money market funds saw net 
outflows over the same period as yields on these funds remained extremely low. 
Treasury Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury cond ucted auctions of nominal and inflation-
protected coupon securities across the term stru cture.  Issuance totaled about $265 billion 
and was generally well received, as bid-to-cove r ratios remained within recent ranges.  
Measures of foreign participation continue  to suggest strong demand for U.S. Treasury 
securities from abroad. 
The functioning of the Treasury coupon market improved further.  Fitting errors from 
staff yield curve models continued to shrink, bid-asked spreads remained near pre-crisis 
levels, and trading volumes picked up.  Spr eads between yields on on- and off-the-run 
notes narrowed considerably at the short end, although hedging-related demand appeared 
to maintain pressure on these spreads fo r longer-dated Treasury securities.  The 
implementation of the Treasury Market Practices Group’s re commendation of a 
mandatory charge for delivery failures in th e market for U.S. Treasury securities appears 
to have gone smoothly, and fails-to-deliver of Treasury securities have generally been 
low recently, with just a few noticeable exceptions. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Conditions in the municipal bond market continued to improve.  Gross issuance of long-
term municipal bonds remained solid in Ma y, as new capital issuan ce continued apace.  
Refundings decreased in respons e to higher interest rates,  and short-term issuance

2 Ratings upgrades outpaced downgrades in the first quarter, but most of the upgrades reportedly 
reflect a change in S&P’s rating methodology for municipal bonds.    remained weak, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.2  Yields on long-term municipal 
bonds rose somewhat, on net, over the inte rmeeting period; even so, the ratio of 
municipal bond yields to yiel ds on comparable-maturity Treasury securities dropped to 
its lowest levels in almost a year.    
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 expanded at an average annual rate of  just ¾ percent during April and May, a 
significant slowdown from the rate of grow th observed in the first quarter, as the 
reallocation of household wealth toward the safety and liquidity  of M2 assets appeared to 
have moderated.  Retail money market funds and small time deposits contracted in both 
months, probably in response to declining interest rates on these assets .  Currency growth 
slowed, likely reflecting prim arily a waning in foreign demand.  The monetary base 
continued its recent expansion in April and May, although at a slower pace of growth 
than in the first quarter, as the effect of Fe deral Reserve asset purchases on reserves was 
mostly offset by a drop in usage of liquidity facilities.   
Commercial bank credit increased slightly in May following six consecutive monthly 
declines, but the turnaround reflected a rise in securities holdings and in the volatile 
“other” loans category (that is, loans other than C&I, real es tate, and consumer loans).  
C&I loans dropped at an annual pace of 16 percent in May amid subdued origination 
activity and broad-based paydowns of outsta nding loans.  Home equity loans edged 
down—the first monthly decline in this category since October 2006—partly owing to 
banks’ reductions in existing lines of credit.   Closed-end residential mortgages decreased 
at a 9 percent pace; originati ons were reportedly strong, but th ey were more than offset 
by loan sales to the GSEs.  In April and Ma y, consumer loans originated by banks shrank 
at a 3½ percent pace, on averag e, and on-balance-sheet holdings decreased even more 
because of a number of large credit card securitizations.  The rise in banks’ holdings of 
securities last month reportedly reflected th e retention of some portions of these ABS 
deals. 
First-quarter Call Report data showed a further widespread deterioratio n in credit quality.  
The industry-wide charge-off rate rose to more  than 2 percent of all loans, the highest 
level since before at least 1985, and the ove rall delinquency rate increased to about 
5½ percent, the highest level recorded since the fourth quarter of 1991.  Even with the 
pressure on earnings from worsening credit  quality, large banks as a group were

 profitable in the first quarter, reflecting a jump in noninter est income related, in part, to 
new FASB accounting rules and a decrease in noninterest expense.   In contrast, profits of 
banks not among the top 25 BHCs continued to be negative as loss provisions increased 
further.  For the banking sector as a whole,  total unused commitments to fund loans, an 
indicator of bank credit availabi lity, contracted sharply in the first quarter.  Regulatory 
capital ratios increased to near the upper end of  their historical ranges  in the first quarter, 
as commercial banks continued to receive large amounts of capital from parent holding 
companies while average tangible assets and ri sk-weighted assets declined markedly.   
Loan pricing data from the Survey of Term s of Business Lending c onducted in early May 
indicated that C&I loan rate spreads over co mparable-maturity market instruments rose 
noticeably compared with the February survey.  The increase was partly attributable to a 
steep increase in spreads for loans made under commitment.  As time has passed, more of 
these loans have been drawn under commitments that were priced since the onset of the 
financial crisis and so refl ect wider prevailing spreads.

 IV-1 U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $29.2 billion in April, from a revised 
$28.5 billion in March, as a decrease in imports was offset by a slightly larger fall in 
exports.   
 
 
The value of exports of goods and services fell 2.3 percent in April after decreasing 
2 percent in March.  Most major categories of exports fell in April, with exports of 
machinery, industrial supplies, and consumer goods exhibiting significant d eclines.   
 
The average value of exports in the first quarter declined 39 percent at an annual rate, as 
almost all major categories of exports moved down, with exports of machinery, industrial 
supplies, and automotive products recording large decreases.  The decrease in exports of 
automotive products reflected weak global demand but also the significant production 
cutbacks implemented by U.S. automakers domestically as well as in Canada and 
Mexico.  Production cutbacks also contributed to sharp declines in auto imports (see 
below).  In contrast, exports of aircraft increased following the end of production 
disruptions at Boeing in the fourth quarter.

 The
 value of imports of goods and services fell 1.4 percent in April after remaining about 
unchanged in March.  Imports of machinery and industrial supplies displayed significant 
decreases, and imports of services fell moderately.  Imports of oil and consumer goods 
increased, with the increase in the value of oil imports reflecting higher prices, as 
volumes mov ed down. 
The average value of imports in the first quarter plummeted 55 percent at an annual rate.  
About one-third of the decline reflected a fall in the value of oil imports on account of 
lower prices.  All other major categories of imports also declined sharply.  Imports of 
machinery, automotive products, and industrial supplies exhibited particularly large 
declines. 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In April, prices of core imports were little changed from March with a 
0.3 percent decline in prices for material-intensive goods offsetting a 0.1 percent price 
increase in prices for finished goods.  In May, core import prices increased 0.2 percent, 
the first increase since August 2008, as prices for material-intensive goods increased 
0.6 percent, reflecting recent rises in commodity prices.   
The
 average level of core import prices in April and May was almost 2  percent at an 
annual rate below the first-quarter average.  Prices for material-intensive goods were 
down 5 percent, whereas prices for finished goods fell ½ percent. 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil rose 9.8 percent in April 
and was up an additional 8 .3 percent in May.  The index has now risen for four 
consecutive months since the trough that occurred in January of this year.  The spot price 
of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose at a more modest 3 percent pace in 
April before shooting up nearly 20 percent in May to average $59 per barrel for the 
month as a whole.  Since that time, spot WTI has continued to increase, closing most 
recently on June 16 at $70. 62 per barrel.  While the lagged effects of OPEC supply 
restraint are likely providing some upward support, the sharply higher prices appear to 
also reflect more buoyant prospects for global demand for oil.    
E
xports.  After falling sharply in February and March, core export prices rose 
0.4 pe
rcent in April and 0.6 percent in May.  In both months, the increase was led by 
prices for agricultural products, which rose over 3.5 percent each month.  In contrast, 
non-agricultural industrial supplies rose at a more modest pace each month, increasing 
IV-5 
 0.3 percent in April and 0.5 percent in May.  Prices for finished goods fell 0.1 percent in 
April and rose 0.2 percent in May, reflecting movements in the prices of consumer goods.  
IV-6 
 
 
IV-7 
 
 
IV-8 
 The average level of core export prices in April and May was ½ percent at an annual rate 
above the first-quarter average.  The rise can be attributed to the 10 percent increase in 
prices of agricultural products, which fell at a 12½ percent pace in the first quarter.  For 
non-agricultural industrial supplies, after a 28½ percent price decline in the first quarter, 
the average price level in April and May is down only 1 percent relative to the first 
quarter.  Prices of exported finished goods were little changed, as falling prices for 
consumer goods offset price increases for capital goods excluding computers and 
semiconductors. 
 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial 
transactions for March and April and Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) 
custody data for May and the first half of June.  Overall, these flows are consistent with 
the recent easing of tensions in financial markets.  Although as of yet there is little 
indication of foreign investor interest in acquiring riskier U.S. assets, U.S. investors have 
resumed purchasing foreign securities. 
  
After the unusual outflows in the fourth quarter of last year, when some official investors 
sold U.S. securities as they intervened to support their currencies, foreign official inflows 
have resumed this year (see line 1 of the table “Summary of U.S. International 
Transactions”).   
  As has been the case since last summer, official inflows continue 
to be overwhelmingly into U.S. Treasury securities (see the figure “Foreign Official 
Financial Inflows through April 2009”).  FRBNY custody data indicate strong official 
acquisitions in May and so far in June,  
.   
 
As conditions stabilized in interbank funding markets, drawings on central bank liquidity 
swap facilities contracted somewhat further in March and more noticeably in April; this 
decrease generated additional official inflows as Federal Reserve deposit claims at 
partner central banks (included in line 2) decreased.  Net outflows through the private 
banking sector persisted in both March and April (line 3), as private institutions 
continued to replace the liquidity swap facilities as sources of dollar funding abroad.  The 
slowdown in banking outflows in the past two months may reflect a greater ability of 
banks abroad to tap alternative sources of funds or a general reduction in the size of bank 
balance sheets.   

IV-9 
  
 
 
 Foreign private investors continued to seek the safety of Treasury securities in March 
(line 4a) but sold off some of their Treasury holdings in April as the tone in financial 
markets improved.  They appeared reluctant, however, to move into other types of U.S. 
securities (see the upper pa nels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through April 
2009”).  After selling U.S. equities in January and February, foreign private investors 
purchased a small amount, on net, in March and April (line 4d).  So far this year, 
however, they have continued to sell, on net, U.S. agency and corporate debt (lines 4b 
and 4c).  A further indication of continued foreign investor caution is that foreign gross 
purchases and sales of all U.S. securities (not shown) remain near the subdued levels of 
last fall.   
U.S. demand for foreign securities, however, has picked up so far this year (line 5 and the 
bottom panels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through April 2009”).  Strong 
purchases of foreign bonds, primarily new issues, in part reflect the improved 
environment for foreign bond issuance.  The renewed outflows into foreign securities are 
in sharp contrast to the net sales of foreign securities recorded in the second half of last 
year.   
U.S. balance of payments data, including complete information on financial transactions 
in the first quarter, will be released on June 17 and discussed in a Greenbook supplement.

 Foreign Financial Markets 
The major currencies index of the dollar has declined more than 7 percent since the time 
of the April Greenbook, as the dollar depreciated substantially against the currencies of 
all of its major trading partners except the yen.  This decline appeared to be driven by a 
renewed sense of optimism about global growth prospects, leading investors to shift away 
from safe-haven assets in the United States and Japan to riskier assets elsewhere. This 
shift marked a reversal of the flows that supported the dollar and yen in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 when investors moved into safer assets.  Despite some speculation that foreign 
governments were selling U.S. assets and thereby hastening the dollar’s decline, available 
data do not support these rumors (see U.S. International Financial Transactions  in this 
part of the Greenbook), and officials at several Asian central banks publicly reaffirmed 
that their demand for U.S. Treasury securities had not materially changed.  The Mexican 
peso depreciated against the dollar in the wake of Mexico’s weak macroeconomic 
performance over the period,  while Chinese authorities held the renminbi nearly 
unchanged against the dollar.  However, the dollar depreciated against most other 
emerging market currencies, prompting several central banks to intervene to purchase 
dollars in recent weeks.  
Global interbank markets improved in the wake of the May 7 release of the results of the 
Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, and the strong performance 
by financial stocks helped lead headline equity indexes higher.  Although the news over 
the period was dominated by the success that many U.S. banks had in raising capital in 
order to repay funds received from the TARP, several foreign banks also took advantage 
of improved credit conditions to raise capital, including Barclays, Lloyds, 
Commerzebank and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.  In addition, foreign 
banks increased their issuance of debt outside of their government guarantee programs. 
Libor- to-OIS spreads in euro and sterling decreased as foreign banks began to 
successfully access capital markets.  Spreads between three-month euro Libor and OIS 
rates fell from 56 to 48 basis points while comparable spreads in sterling fell from  
107 to 81 basis points.  The improved access to capital markets and the better economic 
outlook buoyed bank stocks, which rose 11 to 14 percent in Europe and Japan, while 
headline stock indexes in those countries rose 6 to 12 percent.  Most EME stock markets 
rose at least 10 percent, with several rising more than 20 percent, and mutual fund flows 
into those markets strengthened.    
IV-14 
  
 
 Yields on long-term sovereign nominal and indexed bonds rose over the period, though 
by less than in the United States.  Yields on benchmark German and British nominal 
bonds increased 32 and 45 basis points respectively, with rates on comparable 
inflation-protected bonds rising 7 and 19 basis points.  Although the widening differences 
between nominal and real bond yields might be interpreted as indicating that inflation 
expectations have increased, it seems likely that improving liquidity conditions 
contributed substantially to the more limited rise in inflation-protected yields.  The rise in 
yields has likely been at least partially driven by an increased willingness on the part of 
investors to move out of safe assets such as government bonds and into riskier 
investments; however, a segment of the investment community seems also to have grown 
concerned about the effect that rising fiscal deficits may have on inflation and the returns 
to holding long-term bonds.  On May 21, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook for the United 
Kingdom, warning that government debt may soar close to 100 percent of GDP.   
Ten-year gilt yields rose 15 basis points over the following day and a half, while the 
pound declined 1.5 percent despite t he fact that Fitch and Moody’s reaffirmed their 
highest ratings for the United Kingdom.   
The rise in bond yields among the advanced foreign economies came even though the 
ECB lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1 percent while the Bank of England 
and Bank of Japan kept their policy rates fixed at very low levels.  The ECB and Bank of 
England also announced new unconventional monetary policy decisions. Yields on 
longer- term gilts fell immediately after the Bank of England’s announced on May 7 tha t 
it would increase the size of its asset purchases from £75 billion to £125 billion, but this 
action only temporarily halted the upward trend in rates. Yields on covered bonds fell up 
to 30 basis points in the days following the ECB’s May 7 announcement t hat it would 
purchase up to €60 billion of those bonds. As with gilts, yields on European covered 
bonds have since risen, but the spread between covered and government bonds has 
remained lower than its level prior to the ECB’s announcement.

  Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
The contraction of output in the advanced foreign economies deepened in the first 
quarter, with real GDP declining at an average pace of more than 7½ percent.  Domestic 
demand plummeted in all major economies, led by double-digit declines in fixed 
investment and sizable negative contributions of inventories to growth.  Recent indicators 
of economic activity, however, suggest that the pace of contraction likely moderated in 
the current quarter.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) rebounded from the 
exceptionally low levels reached in the first quarter, and industrial production stabilized 
somewhat, expanding in several economies for the first time in about a year. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to moderate, with headline inflation 
standing around zero in all major economies except the United Kingdom, where it has 
moved down to about 2 percent.  Excluding food and energy prices, the slowing in 
consumer price inflation has been roughly stable.  Over the intermeeting period, the 
European Central Bank (ECB) reduced its main policy rate ¼ percentage point and also 
announced that it will purchase €60 billion worth of covered bonds over the next 
12 months.  The Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have continued 
purchasing assets as part of their unconventional monetary policy actions. 
IV-21 
 
 
 
IV-22 
  
 
Japanese GDP fell a record-breaking 14.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter following 
a 13.5 percent contraction in the fourth quarter.  Total domestic demand and net exports 
provided comparable negative contributions to the first-quarter fall.  Real private 
investment dropped almost 30 percent (a.r.), and has now fallen in six out of the past 
seven quarters.  Private consumption declined further, and government consumption was 
little changed.  Both exports and imports plunged at an unprecedented pace, resulting on 
net in a negative contribution of the external sector to growth of about 8 percentage 
points.  
IV-23 
 
 
IV-24 
  
 
 
 Recent indicators for economic activity are mixed but positive on balance.  Industrial 
production jumped a near-record 5.2 percent in April, although it remains well below its 
year ago level.  Consumption growth in March and April was much better than expected, 
and consumer confidence increased further.  Real exports rose sharply in April and 
imports edged up, suggesting that net exports might contribute positively to growth in the 
second quarter.   
Indicators for the housing sector and the labor market remain weak.  In April, housing 
starts fell roughly 12 percent from the previous month and were down more than 
30 percent in the last 12 months.  The ratio of job openings to  applicants (the number of 
officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) 
reached a record low level of 0.46 in April.  Employment fell 1.7 percent over the last 
12 months, a rate consistent with the 2001 and 1974 recessions, and the unemployment 
rate increased to 5 percent. 
Japanese consumer prices fell slightly over the 12 months ending in April, leaving 
inflation well below the peak of 2.3 percent reached last July.  Excluding food and energy 
prices, 12 -month consumer price inflation was -0.4 percent in April.   
The Bank of Japan left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the 
intermeeting period and continued to purchase commercial paper, co rporate bonds, 
equities, and government bonds.  On the fiscal front, political infighting appears to be 
slowing the implementation of the fiscal stimulus packages announced earlier this year.  
At the end of May, however, the Japanese government enacted a supplementary budget 
funding a large portion of the stimulus.   
IV-25 
  
 
 
 
In the euro area , real GDP contracted 9.7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, 
with German GDP falling more than 14  percent.  Inventory adjustment was a significant 
drag on euro-area GDP growth after contributing positively to growth late last year.  Both 
investment and consumption spending declined at about their fourth-quarter pace.  The 
negative contribution of net exports was less severe than in the previous two quarters, as 
the decline in imports was deeper than the drop in exports. 
Indicators received during the intermeeting period point to a moderation in the pace of 
contraction in the current quarter.  Industrial production in March and April fell at the 
slowest rate since last August.  Retail sales edged up in April for the first time in seven 
months.  The business climate index and economic sentiment indicators rebounded 
moderately in April and May.  PMIs rose in April and turned up sharply in May.  
In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to worsen.  The euro-area 
unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent in April, up from a low of 7.2 percent in early 
2008.  However, the extent of deterioration has varied considerably among euro-area 
countries, with the Spanish unemployment rate up more than 10 percentage points from 
IV-26 
  
 its most recent low, while Germany’s unemployment rate has r isen only about 
½ percentage point.  The relatively small response of the German unemployment rate, 
partly, reflects government subsidies to firms to retain employees.  The decline in the 
German workweek has been more significant.  
Twelve-month euro-area inflation was zero in May, down from 0.6 percent in April.  
Excluding energy and unprocessed food, inflation was 1.6 percent. 
The Governing Council of the ECB cut its main policy rate 25 basis points, to 1 percent, 
at its May 7 meeting.  In addition, President Trichet announced plans to extend the 
maturity of liquidity operations up to 12 months, prolong the duration for the extended 
list of eligible collateral to the end of 2010, and buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds.  
At its June 4 meeting, the ECB kept its policy rate unchanged and provided more details 
on its asset purchase program: Covered bond purchases will be made in both primary and 
secondary markets, will be spread out over the year starting in July 2009, and will 
involve bonds that are eligible for use as collateral in the ECB ’s financing operations, 
with a minimum rating of AA from one of the three main ratings agencies.

IV-28 
  
 
 
 
 In the United Kingdom , real output contracted 7.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, 
pushed down by a correspondingly sharp fall in domestic demand.  Private consumption 
dropped almost 5 percent, and investment tumbled amid cutbacks in capital expenditures 
across virtually all sectors.  Inventories continued to contribute negatively to growth, 
whereas the external sector again contributed positively to growth. 
Incoming data suggest that the pace of economic contraction has moderated markedly in 
the second quarter.  Industrial production edged up in April after declining for 
13 consecutive months.  In May, the PMI index rose above 50 for the first time since 
April 2008, a reading consistent with a slight expansion.  Orders for new houses and 
lending for house purchases edged up in March and April, suggesting that activity in the 
housing sector has stabilized somewhat.  In May, the number of persons claiming 
unemployment benefits posted the smallest increase since July 2008. 
Price pressure eased noticeably in recent months.  The 12-month rate of consumer price 
inflation fell to 2.2 percent in May.   Excluding food and energy, inflation was 
1.4 percent.  
During the intermeeting period, the BOE continued its steady purchases of public and 
private assets under its quantitative easing program.  As of June 4, the BOE had acquired 
nearly £80 billion in assets, the vast majority ( £77 billion) of which were gilts.

 In Canada , real GDP fell 5.4 percent in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.) following a 3.7 percent 
decline in the previous quarter.  Total domestic demand declined almost 10 percent, as 
investment fell sharply and inventories provided a sizable negative contribution to 
growth.  The decline in private consumption was smaller than in the fourth quarter, but 
government consumption growth slowed.  Net exports made a large positive contribution 
to growth as imports fell faster than exports.   
More recently, retail sales turned positive in March and the index of leading indicators 
edged up in April.  Manufacturing shipments rose slightly in April, and new orders fell a 
moderate 3.2 percent following a 3 percent fall in March.  Housing starts have continued 
to fall and in May were 11 percent below the first-quarter average.  After a brief respite in 
April, employment declined in May and has contracted in six of the past seven months.   
Twelve-month headline inflation in April was 0.6 percent, down from its peak of 
3.5 percent in August 2008.  Inflation excluding food and energy was 1 percent in April, 
down from last year but within its range over the past several years. 
At its June meeting, the Bank of Canada kept its policy rate at 0.25 percent and reiterated 
its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until the 
end of the second quarter of 2010.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Data received since the last Greenbook show that first-quarter real GDP contracted 
sharply in Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore but expanded considerably in 
India and Indonesia and slightly in Korea.  For the current quarter, indicators suggest 
continued stabilization of activity in emerging market economies (EMEs).  In China, 
which appears to be front-running the recovery, retail sales and fixed asset investment 
expanded strongly.  Financial conditions have continued to improve in most EMEs since 
the time of the April Greenbook:  CDS premiums narrowed further, equity markets 
surged, the currencies of several EMEs have appreciated, and capital flows to EMEs 
appear to have increased.  Inflation continued to decline in emerging Asia and has begun 
to ease in Latin America.  After cutting policy rates aggressively earlier, many central 
banks in emerging Asia have kept their rates on hold since the last Greenbook, although 
Indonesia and the Philippines are exceptions.  Central banks in Latin America are 
continuing to lower policy rates, as their easing cycle began later than emerging Asia’s.  
In China , indicators point to a relatively strong expansion in economic activity, boosted 
by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus.  In May, all subindexes of the purchasing 
managers index were in the expansionary range, including, for the first time since June 
2008, the new export orders index.  Cement and auto production experienced large 
increases in April and May, reflecting a rebound in the construction sector and continued 
strong demand for durable goods.  Fixed asset investment also grew sharply over the first 
two months of the second quarter, and retail sales remained robust.  The trade balance in 
April and May shrank relative to the first-quarter average as imports increased.  The 
fiscal stimulus appears to be a significant driver of investment and imports.  The 
Shanghai composite stock index has risen more than 60 percent from its trough in 
November and is up 13 percent since the time of the April Greenbook, likely providing a 
boost to consumer confidence. 
Benchmark interest rates and banks’ reserve requirements have been on hold since the 
end of last year, but the Chinese authorities have been encouraging loan growth this year 
after limiting it over the past few years.  Consequently, the increase in outstanding loans 
through May of this year already exceeds the growth seen in all of 2008.    Chinese 
consumer prices in May were 1½ percent below their year-earlier level, but seasonally 
adjusted monthly inflation has been positive in each of the past three months.

India’s GDP grew 7.8 percent (s.a.a.r) in the first quarter of 2009, well above staff and 
market expectations.  Growth was particularly strong in the services and construction 
sectors.   The headline purchasing managers index increased in both April and May, led 
by orders and production.  The trade deficit narrowed in April, as the fall in imports was 
sharper than that in exports.  Consumer price inflation increased in April,  whereas 
wholesale price inflation decreased.  This divergence reflects the large increase in food 
prices in April, which account for a greater share of consumer prices.  The government’s 
fiscal deficit for the 2008 fiscal year came in at a record high 6.2 percent of GDP, well 
above the official target.  National elections concluded in May, and the National 
Congress Party increased the strength of its coalition government and reelected 
Manmohan Singh as the prime minister.  Markets reacted positively to the election 
results, as the Congress Party has long supported economic reforms.

 Economic activity in the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs)1 generally continued to 
contract in the first quarter, as external and domestic demand remained weak.  In South 
Korea, however, first-quarter GDP inched up after a severe contraction in the fourth 
quarter of last year, primarily because of the effect of previous fiscal stimulus and 
monetary policy easing.  Indicators for the second quarter point to some firming of 
activity among the NIEs.  Exports have picked up from their depressed levels in previous 
months, and April industrial production was up across the region.  Retail sales and 
indexes of consumer and business sentiment also show some signs of recovery.  
Moreover, purchasing managers index readings have improved, although they remain in 
the range indicating contraction. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to fall across the region during the 
second quarter and turned negative in Taiwan and Singapore, reflecting considerable 
slack in economic activity and, in some cases, continued declines in administered energy 
prices.  Hong Kong announced a new stimulus package worth HK$10 billion (0.6 percent 
of GDP).  The stimulus includes a one-off income tax rebate and spending on public 
infrastructure.  Central banks have kept policy rates unchanged, following significant rate 
reductions in previous months.

 Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN-4) 2, real GDP contracted 
sharply in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand the first quarter but rebounded in 
Indonesia, rising a surprising 6.2 percent.  Available indicators for April suggest a 
resurgence of activity in Thailand, where industrial production increased considerably on 
a monthly basis.  Exports increased in April in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.  
Despite these monthly improvements, the level of trade in these economies is still well 
below its pre-crisis levels. 
Inflation continued to recede across the region.  With declining price pressures, the 
central banks of Indonesia and the Philippines each lowered their policy rates 25 basis 
points in May.  Bank Indonesia reduced its policy rate an additional 25 basis points in 
early June.

 Real GDP in Mexico  fell a dramatic 21½ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, 
matching the quarterly contraction at the peak of the 1994-95 peso crisis.  So far in the 
second quarter, incoming data provide a mixed picture.  The manufacturing purchasing 
managers index moved up, on balance, in April and May, but activity in the services 
sector weakened with a large adverse effect of the swine flu outbreak.  The outbreak 
peaked in late April and forced the government to temporarily suspend public education 
and all non-essential activities in Mexico City.  In April, exports declined further, but at a 
much slower pace than in the first quarter.   The trade deficit narrowed, as declines in 
imports exceeded those in exports.     
Twelve-month headline consumer price inflation remained at around 6 percent in recent 
months, reflecting, in part, the earlier pass-through from the depreciation of the peso 
against the U.S. dollar.  During the intermeeting perid, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) cut its 
policy rate 75 basis points, bringing it down to 5¼ percent.  With recent stability in the 
foreign exchange market, Mexican officials announced that the BOM will reduce its daily 
foreign exchange sales to the interbank market to $50 million a day from the current 
$100 million.  The BOM will also reduce the amount it auctions on any day when the 
peso depreciates against the dollar at least two percent from $300 million to $250 million.  
The officials left open the possibility of auctioning larger amounts if market conditions 
warrant.

 Brazilian  real GDP declined 3.3 percent at annual rate in the first quarter, pulled down 
by the continued plunge in investment.  Private consumption was up 3 percent, supported 
by fiscal stimulus and government-sponsored credit growth.  Both exports and imports 
continued to plummet in the first quarter each falling about 50 percent at an annual rate.  
On the production side, industrial output declined sharply, while services output rose 
3 percent.  There have been signs of recovery so far this quarter.  Industrial production 
rose for the fourth straight month in April but remained 15 percent below its September 
peak.  The purchasing managers index continued to climb from its lows in January.  
There have been anecdotal reports that inventories have been winding down.     
At its mid-June meeting, the Central Bank of Brazil cut its target for the policy rate 100 
basis points, to a record low 9¼ percent.  Net capital inflows have resumed, prompting 
the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate upward pressures 
on the real.  Inflationary pressures continued to abate.

 In Russia , real GDP fell 32 percent in the first quarter, in part, reflecting the adverse 
effects of the earlier declines in oil prices.  Industrial production, retail sales, and 
transportation all contracted.  However, boosted by the recent increases in oil prices, net 
exports jumped 28 percent in March and posted a small gain in April following eight 
straight months of decline.  The purchasing managers index has improved but remained 
in the range indicating contraction in May.  Inflation has slowed, due, in part, to 
stabilization of the ruble.  The central bank cut the refinancing rate 150 basis points to 
11½ percent in a series of moves over May and June.  In addition, the central bank has 
recently started to purchase foreign currency to stem ruble appreciation.   
In emerging Europe , economic activity collapsed in the Baltic economies, with first-
quarter real GDP contracting at an annual rate of 22 percent in Estonia, 38 percent in 
Lithuania, and nearly 50 percent in Latvia.  In Latvia, the collapse in output raised doubts 
about the government’s ability to meet the fiscal targets in the country’s IMF program 
and led to increasing pressure on the Latvian exchange rate in early June.  In mid-June, 
Latvia’s parliament passed draconian budget cuts, increasing the likelihood of securing 
the next IMF disbursement.  Elsewhere in emerging Europe, real GDP also contracted, 
but to a much lesser extent.  Particularly affected were some countries in Central Europe 
with relatively large automobile sectors.
