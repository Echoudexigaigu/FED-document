1 An appendix describes the BEA’s comprehensive revision of the national income and product 
accounts (NIPA), which we received last Friday.  Because the BEA released its detailed breakdowns for 
components of GDP and for prices just before Greenbook publication, some of the text and figures include 
more limited detail than usual. Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. The incoming data suggest that overall economic  activity is stabilizing.  Employment and 
manufacturing output continued to move lower through June, but the pace of decline has 
slowed noticeably in recent months.  Moreover, a sizable pickup in motor vehicle 
production appears to be under way.  Housing ac tivity is likely in the process of emerging 
from its prolonged slump, and consumer spending has moved down only a little further, on net, after having fallen sharply in the second half of last year.  The decline in equipment and software investment seems to be moderating, although the incoming data 
do not point to an imminent recovery.  Regarding inflation, core cons umer price inflation 
has remained relatively stable in recent mont hs, though a jump in gasoline prices pushed 
up overall consumer inflation in June.

Labor Market Developments  
Job losses continued in June, although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year.  Private 
nonfarm payroll employment fell 440,000 per m onth, on average, in the second quarter, 
down from an average of nearly 700,000 in the first quarter.  Most industries reported a 
slower pace of job loss in recent months, and employment in nonbusiness services—which includes education and health, along w ith other categories—rose in June for a 
second month. 
In addition to cutting jobs, firms have reduced their labor input by shortening hours 
worked.  Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private 
nonfarm payrolls, which had fallen steeply, on net, since last September, edged down 
further in June.  Aggregate hours of these workers fell at an annual rate of nearly 
8 percent in the second quarter, only a little less than in the first quarter. 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te moved up 0.1 percentage point in June 
to 9.5 percent.  The fraction of workers who were working part time for economic 
reasons held steady in June, but at a high level.  The la bor force participation rate 
dropped back a bit in June, but has fallen relati vely little, on net, si nce the onset of the 
recession, despite the deterioration in labor demand.  Among the factors that may have contributed to the resiliency  in labor force participation, the emergency unemployment 
compensation (EUC) program that began in July 2008 has likely encouraged unemployed

to the levels of the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate. individuals to stay in the labor force.2  In addition, losses in household balance sheets 
may have led some workers to delay retireme nt and some secondary workers to enter the 
labor force. 
Other indicators also suggest a slower pace of deterioration in labor demand.  With the 
effects of changes in the timing of summer shutdowns in the auto industry and other 
difficulties with seasonal adjustment la rgely behind us, both initial claims for 
unemployment insurance and insured unemplo yment appear to have moved down since 
June.  Layoff rates—as gauged by the layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings 
and Labor Turnover Survey and the percenta ge of short-term job losers from the 
household survey—stayed high in recent months, while measures of job vacancies appear 
to have stabilized at low levels.  In additi on, alternative measures of labor market slack—
job availability as reported in  the Conference Board survey and hard-to-fill positions as 
indicated in the NFIB survey—ha ve not deteriorated further. 
Regarding forward-looking indicators of la bor market conditions, hiring plans in the 
NFIB survey have moved up a bit so far th is year, and those in the Manpower survey 
have edged sideways; both series had falle n steeply during the past two years.  In 
addition, households’ expectations of futu re labor market conditions have shown a 
marked improvement.

3 The series for capacity utilization in manufacturing begins in January 1948. 
4 Boeing had expected to begin deliveries of the Dreamliner in 2010.  As of Greenbook publication, 
Boeing had not announced a revised delivery schedule for the 787. 
5 Boeing lowered its expected deliveries for both the 747 freighter and the 777 starting around midyear. The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an 
annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter after edging up at a ra te of 0.3 percent in 
the first quarter.  Over the f our quarters ending in the second quarter of this year, labor 
productivity is estimated to have risen 1.6 percent. 
Industrial Production  
The pace of decline in industrial production (IP ) slowed markedly to a still considerable 
annual rate of about 12 percent in the sec ond quarter.  The available indicators of 
production for July, including weekly output da ta, suggest that IP increased noticeably 
last month, led by a jump in motor vehicle assemblies; excluding motor vehicles, output 
in manufacturing likely rose a bit last month.  Regarding capacity ut ilization, the factory 
operating rate recorded another historical low in June:  At 64.6 percent, this rate was 
about 4 percentage points below its prev ious cyclical record low in December 1982.3 
After having fallen at an a nnual rate of nearly 70 percen t in the first quarter, the 
production of motor vehicles and parts declined  another 14 percent in  the second quarter.  
Preliminary estimates for July indicate that  light vehicle assemblies rose sharply and, 
combined with a concurrent rise in parts ou tput, likely contribute d about ¾ percentage 
point to the rate of change in total IP last  month.  Elsewhere in the transportation sector, 
the output of aircraft and pa rts declined roughly 16½ percen t at an annual rate in the 
second quarter, as production moved down following a post-strike rebound to a 
somewhat above normal level earlier this year.  Recently, Boeing announced a further 
delay in the 787 Dreamliner program.4  Despite the delay, commercial aircraft production 
probably will remain close to current leve ls in coming months due to Boeing’s large 
backlog of orders.5  
After tumbling in the first quarter, the produc tion of high-tech equipment fell at a more 
modest annual rate of 7½ pe rcent in the second quarter.  Production in the various 
components was mixed last quart er, as continued declines in  the output of computers and 
communications equipment were partly offset  by an increase in semiconductor output.  
The second-quarter gain in semiconductors was mostly due to higher chip production, 
particularly of microprocessors and DRAM, wh ich partly reflected the replenishment of 
inventories following substantial reductions in  the past few quarters; output in nonchip 
categories, such as circuit boards, conti nued to move down.  For computers, unit

shipments moved slightly higher in the sec ond quarter, but real output fell as production 
shifted toward lower-valued machines, such as netbooks.  The output of communications 
equipment in the second quarter declined at  an annual rate of 20 percent, a decrease 
broadly consistent with the steep dr op in capital expenditures by major 
telecommunications service providers over the first half of the year. 
Indicators of future movements in high-tech output continue to be mixed.  For semiconductors, Intel is upbeat about semiconductor demand over the remainder of this year, but it also reported that its revenue w ill decline in the third quarter, partly because 
of the shift to lower-priced chips.  After having plunged in the first quarter, orders for circuit boards increased last qua rter, and shipments rose in June for the first time this 
year.  Further downstream, anecdotes remain  mixed, but several i ndustry sources report 
an increase in third-quarter PC demand.  Cisco recently announced that its revenue was flat in the second quarter a nd will be little changed in th e third quarter.  Although Cisco 
reported that its orders began to increase last  quarter, it was not certain that the pickup 
would be sustained.  Finally, the diffusion index of planned capital spending on high-tech 
equipment in the NABE’s quarterly survey wa s little changed in the second quarter; at 
about 50, the index suggests that  high-tech spending is likely to remain lackluster in the 
near term. 
In the energy sector, producti on fell at an annual rate of 14 percent in the second quarter, 
reflecting weather-related drops in the output of  utilities and continue d sharp declines in 
drilling activity. Excluding the production of energy, motor vehicles, aircraft, and high-technology 
products, output fell at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter, about one-half 
of the pace of decline in the first quarter.  While the markedly slower pace of decline was 
broadly based, a notable exception was the output of business equipment, whose 
21 percent plunge last quarter wa s only slightly le ss steep than in the first quarter.  
Elsewhere, the production of consumer goods fell at an annual rate of 5 percent last 
quarter—after dropping 9 percen t in the first quarter—as d eclines continued in both 
durables and nondurables.  The indexes for bot h construction and business supplies also 
fell at a slower pace last quarter.  The produc tion of durable materials declined at an 
annual rate of 24 percent in  the second quarter, but the index for nondurable materials 
was little changed, in part because of higher output in the chemical industry. Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity  have brightened somewhat recently and 
suggest that factory output is poised to turn up modestly in the next few months.  The

6 About 40 percent of the jump in schedules this quarter reflects the planned resumption of production 
at GM and Chrysler.  The other 60 percent reflects scheduled production increases at the other major 
automakers, particularly Ford and Toyota. three-month moving average of the staff’s se ries on real adjusted  durable goods orders 
rose for the second straight month in June, and both the diffusion index of new orders 
from the national manufacturing ISM survey an d the average of the new orders diffusion 
indexes from the regional manufacturing surveys moved above 50 la st month.  Lastly, 
manufacturing activity in the foreign sector appears to have edged up in recent months, 
possibly signaling the return of some ex ternal support for domestic manufacturing. 
Motor Vehicles   
Production of light motor vehicles was at an annual rate of about 4½ million units in the 
second quarter—little changed from its histori cally low first-quarter rate—as the effects 
of the shutdowns at GM and Chrysler were offset by modest increases in production at 
most other automakers.  The pullback in produc tion this year has slas hed dealers’ stocks 
of domestic light vehicles to extremely low levels, and the days’ supply of vehicles fell 
from a peak of 100 days in February to a fa irly comfortable 70 days at the end of the 
second quarter.  Days’ supply fell further to an extremely low level in July as sales were 
boosted appreciably by the government’s so ca lled cash-for-clunkers program (see below 
for more discussion). 
The latest industry schedules call for production to  rise substantially in  the third quarter, 
to an annual rate of 6.4 m
illion units, reflect ing the resumption of operations at GM and 
Chrysler and efforts by other automakers to boost assemblies now that inventories have 
become leaner.6  The weekly production data we have received for July point to an 
appreciable rise in vehicle out put.  Production at scheduled le vels this quarter should help 
bring inventories in to better balance. 
Sales of light m
otor vehicles edged up in th e second quarter, rising fo r the first time since 
the recession began.  The improvement in the second quarter coincided with both a 
decrease in consumers’ concerns about tight credit conditions and a rise in the percentage of respondents in the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers noting lower 
prices and the availability of good deals.

7 Sales at GM, which emerged from bankruptcy on July  10, increased significantly in July after having 
been well maintained in recent months.  In spite of the company’s highly publicized restructuring, its 
market share has recovered some after bottoming out ea rlier this year.  In contrast, although Chrysler, 
which emerged from bankruptcy on June 10, also realized a jump in July sales, it has ceded market share. 
8 Many automakers also launched extremely generous promotions to coincide with the start of the 
government’s cash for clunkers program. 
9 Eligible trade-ins are limited to vehicles in driv able condition, which have been continuously insured 
by the same owner for at least a year prior to trade-in , were manufactured in model year 1984 or later, and 
have a combined fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon (mpg) or less.  Trade-ins must be replaced by a 
new vehicle priced at $45,000 or less.   The new auto must get at least 22 mpg and be at least 4 mpg more 
fuel efficient than the old vehicle to  qualify for a $3,500 voucher; if the new car gets at least 10 mpg more 
than the old vehicle, the voucher is worth $4,500.  New light trucks must get at least 18 mpg and be at least 
2 mpg more fuel efficient than the old vehicle to qualify for a $3,500 voucher; if the new vehicle gets at 
least 5 mpg more than the old, the voucher is worth $4,500.  Dealers must first provide documentation that trade-ins have been scrapped. 
10 As of Greenbook publication, the Congress was considering an extension of funding for cash for 
clunkers. In July, sales of light motor vehicles soared  about 1.5 million units, to  an annual rate of 
11.2 million.7  As noted, the surge in demand last  month largely resulted from the cash 
for clunkers program, and the composition of  the sales increase was heavily skewed 
towards automobiles.8  The Congress allocated $1 billion to the program under the 
Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save (o r CARS) Act, which was enacted in June.  
The program—which provides auto dealers w ith vouchers to be applied against the 
purchase price of new vehicles after eligible  trade-ins—officially began on July 27 and 
was expected to run through the end of October.9  However, the response so dramatically 
exceeded expectations that al l of the vouchers appear to have been exhausted by early 
August.10  Although the program is boosting sales si gnificantly, much of that increment in 
demand appears likely to be borrowed from later in the year. 
Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending in the first half of this year moved a little lowe r, on balance, after 
having fallen sharply in the second half of la st year.  The fiscal stimulus package, 
including lower tax withholdi ngs for workers, one-time payments for retirees, and 
increased benefits for the unemployed, has provided a noticeable boost to disposable 
income in the first half of the year but could not overcome the restraint on household 
purchases from the weak labor market and the substantial earlier declines in net worth.  
Real PCE edged down 0.1 percent in June af ter holding steady in May and declining 
0.2 percent in April.  Apart from the jump in motor vehicle sales last month, indicators of 
other spending in July, such as ICSC’s w eekly chain store sales and MasterCard’s 
estimate of retail sales, were mixed.

II-17 
The personal saving rate, which had jumped s lightly above 6 percent in May, moved back 
down in June to 4½ percent.  In large part, th e recent movements in the saving rate appear 
to reflect the transitory boost to disposable income from the fiscal stimulus in recent 
months.  Nonetheless, even after smoothing through the effects of temporary stimulus, 
the data suggest that households are saving a higher proportion of their income than prior 
to the recession, as would be expected give n the enormous loss of wealth.  Whether a 
structural shift in the saving function is in process will be difficult to discern for quite a 
while. 
Although the usual determinants of spending re main weak, some of the conditions facing 
households have generally improved recently.  Household net worth, while still far below 
its pre-recession levels, is receiving a boost from  the rise in equity prices since their low 
point in March.  In addition, the July Se nior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicates that the amount of additional tightening of 
conditions and standards for consumer credit ha s moderated further.  That said, the weak 
labor market continues to place significan t strains on households.  Even though higher 
transfers and lower taxes led to  a significant increase in disp osable income in the second 
quarter, nominal wages and salaries recorded another large decrease last quarter (albeit 
less than the decrease in the first quarter),  and the unemployment ra te has continued to 
rise.  In addition, measures of consumer se ntiment recently have retraced a portion of 
their earlier gains, although they still remain well above levels seen at the turn of the 
year. 
Housing  
Data from the housing sector over the past fe w months indicate that  construction activity 
may finally be emerging from its extended decl ine.  In June, single-family housing starts 
registered a sizable increase, and the level of starts stood 30 percent above its record low 
in the first quarter of this year.  Adjusted permit issuance—which is often a more reliable 
indicator of the underlying pace of new cons truction activity—was somewhat below the 
rate of starts in June but also has generall y moved up in recent months.  However, in the 
much smaller multifamily sector, starts have co ntinued to decline, on net, this year after 
having plunged in the second half of 2008 amid tight credit conditions and rapidly deteriorating demand fundamentals for apartment buildings. 
The latest sales data sugges t that new housing demand may also be strengthening after 
having stabilized in the early portion of this year.  The Ce nsus Bureau’s measure of the 
number of new-home sales agreements jumped  to an annual rate of 384,000 units in June, 
an increase of 17 percent from the record lo w in January.

.  Although sales levels still remain quite m
odest, they have been enough, 
given the very slow pace of production, to pare the overhang of unsold single-family 
houses:  In June, these inventor ies stood at about one-half of their peak in the summer of 
2006, and the months’ supply of new homes was down considerably from its record high 
in January. 
Sales of existing single-family houses, which had been fairly flat early in the year, posted 
their third consecutive monthly increase in  June, and pending home sales agreements 
through June suggest that re sale activity will ascend fu rther in the months ahead.11  To be 
sure, the existing-home market has been suppor ted for much of the year by heightened 
volumes of transactions involving bank-owne d and other distressed properties, which 
reportedly accounted for about 40 to 45 per cent of all sales transactions between 
December and April—roughly double their share over the same period in the preceding 
year.12  More recently, however, estimates from  the National Association of Realtors 
indicate that distressed sales dropped to one-third of existin g-home transactions in May 
and June; this development suggests that the mo st recent uptick in resales has been driven 
by an increase in transactions of nondistressed properties.  Meanwhile, though 
foreclosure activity has been ve ry elevated for some time no w, existing-home inventories 
have been on a downward trajectory (both in levels and in relation to sales) since early 
2008.13 
The apparent stabilization in housing demand seen  in recent months is  likely due, in part, 
to improvements in housing affordability stemming from low rates for conforming mortgages and lower house prices.  Even though the market for private-label nonprime 
mortgages remains closed, rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages—at about 5¼ percent—remain very low by historical st andards, and spreads between rates for  
                                                
11 According to the National Association of Realto rs, the high proportion of distressed sales and the 
unusually tight credit conditions in the housing market have made pending home sales a less-informative 
leading indicator of existing home sales than usual. 
12 Although the data on existing home sales include only sales handled by real estate agents, many 
foreclosure-related sales are captured in these statistics because banks frequently hire real estate agents to 
sell repossessed properties. 
13 This measure of existing-home inventories includes many structures that are still occupied by 
owners and renters. The staff estimates that about 1.65 million vacant single-family houses were for sale in the second quarter, up about 40 percent from the le vel that prevailed when home sales peaked in the 
summer of 2005.  The staff’s measure of vacant homes probably understates the true overhang because it does not factor in vacant houses that  are being withheld from the market or are being offered for rent.

jumbo and standard conforming loans have continued to narrow in recent months (even if 
they remain elevated relative to pre-crisis norms).  As for house prices, the repeat-sales 
price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance fell 
9¼ percent over the 12 months ending in May, a somewhat slower rate of decrease than over the preceding 12-month period.
14  Although the declines in house prices over the 
past several years have been good for affordab ility, that positive influence appears still to 
be tempered to a degree by the sizable num ber of potential homebuyers who remain 
hesitant to purchase houses for f ear of additional price declines. 
Equipment and Software 
Real investment in equipment and software (E&S) continued to contract sharply in the 
second quarter, although the estimated 8¼ percent annual rate of decline was 
substantially smaller than in the previous tw o quarters.  The modera tion in the rate of 
decrease in E&S spending resulted from a flattening in business purchases of motor 
vehicles and a slower rate of decline elsewhere. 
Business outlays on motor vehicles leveled o ff in the second quarter after an extended 
period of steep declines.  Medium and heavy tr uck sales increased in both May and June.  
However, both truck sales and orders remain extremely depressed.  Deliveries to rental 
car companies dropped in May and June but rebounded some last month.15  Demand for 
light vehicles from other businesses moved si deways last quarter—al beit at a very low 
level—and increased a fair bit in July. In the high-tech sector, real spending declin ed, on balance, in the second quarter, though 
with mixed results across components.  Real outlays on computers and peripheral 
equipment edged up at an annual rate of about  5 percent in the sec ond quarter, the first 
increase since a year ago.  However, th e BEA estimates that business spending on 
software continued to fall in the second quarter, at an annual rate of 12½ percent.  As for 
forward-looking indicators, orders for high-t ech equipment were up, on balance, in recent 
months from their low point in the first quarter, but the NABE index of capital spending 
plans for computers and communications equipm ent remained at a low level in July.  
                                                 
14 Although some measures of house prices have been about flat in recent months, the monthly data 
tend to be noisy and are subject to revision.

JuneDrilling and Mining Indicators
II-25 
Outside of high-tech and transportation, real  spending on equipment dropped again in the 
second quarter but at a less precipitous p ace than in the previous quarter.  Although 
orders in June remained below shipments in  this category, the gap has closed somewhat, 
implying a slower rate of decline in firms’  backlogs of unfilled orders and suggesting 
somewhat diminished downward pressu re on shipments in coming months. 
Although the fundamental determinants of i nvestment in E&S remain weak, conditions 
appear less unfavorable, on balance,  than earlier in the year.  In particular, the decline in 
business output was less pronounced last quarter than in prior quarters, and the user cost 
of capital fell back somewhat in the sec ond quarter after spiking last year.  Other 
forward-looking indicators have generally im proved recently, but they remain at levels 
consistent with a weak outlook for E&S investment.  Corporate bond spreads over 
Treasury securities have con tinued to ease, and monthly surveys of business conditions 
and sentiment generally have been less downbeat than earlier in the ye ar.  In addition, the 
July SLOOS reported that the net percentage  of banks that tightened on commercial and 
industrial loans receded somewhat, although the share of small businesses reporting 
increased difficulty in obtaining credit remained quite high in the June NFIB survey. 
Nonresidential Construction  
Conditions in the nonresidential constructi on sector generally remain dismal, with 
spending in most major categories remaini ng on a downward trajectory through June.  
While real spending excluding drilling and mining moved up somewhat in the second 
quarter, this increase came on the heels of significant declines over the preceding two 
quarters and was driven almost entirely by energy-related projects (such as new 
electricity generation facilities  and refinery expansions), wh ich surged noticeably in the 
second quarter.  Apart from this pocket of stre ngth, construction activ ity continues to be 
under downward pressure from a slew of nega tive fundamentals:  Available data show 
that vacancy rates are risi ng and that property prices are generally plunging across 
sectors.  In addition, measures of architectural  billings through June remained at levels 
consistent with further spending declines, and the nonres idential constr uction industry 
has continued to shed workers.  Finally, as  indicated by the July SLOOS, the financing 
environment for nonresidential construction pr ojects remains very tight, and available 
Call Report data from the first quarter show that banks are paring back nonresidential 
construction lending.  
Real spending on drilling and mining structures dropped at an annual rate of 70 percent in 
the second quarter after an even  larger decline in the first quarter; available indicators 
suggest that activity has tracked sideways at a low level in recent weeks.  The steep net

16 In all, real nonfarm inventories are estimated to ha ve fallen at an annual rate of $149 billion in the 
second quarter, with about one-third of this liquidation occurring in the motor vehicle sector. 
17 The ARRA and expanded EUC benefits are estima ted to have boosted outlays in the April–June 
period of this year by about $64 billion.  In the sa me period last year, spending was increased by about 
$30 billion by the portion of the 2008 stimulus rebates that was scored as a budget outlay.  As a result, the 
rise in stimulus-related payments contributed around 4 percentage points to the 10 percent increase in 
outlays in the April–June period. decline in energy prices from last summer’s peak has greatly diminished incentives for 
additional drilling activity.  Th is downward pressure has been  particularly pronounced in 
the natural gas sector, as spot prices have remained near a seven-year low because of weak demand and a glut of new supp ly from recently developed fields. 
Business Inventories   
The sharp cuts in production this year ha ve reduced inventory stocks significantly, 
though stocks remain high relative to the weak level of sales.  In the second quarter, real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles ar e estimated to have fallen at an annual 
rate of $102 billion following a decline of $51 billion in the first quarter.
16  Similarly, the 
staff’s flow-of-goods (FOG) inventory system  indicates a consid erable reduction in 
inventories last quart er.  Nonetheless, both the Census  and FOG system measures of 
months’ supply remain high, suggesting that fu rther inventory cuts are in store if sales 
remain near their current pace.  However, the ISM’s index of customers’ inventories moved further into favorable territory in July ; this reading hints at more-modest declines 
in inventory stocks going forward. 
Federal Government Sector 
The deficit in the federal unified budget dete riorated further in June.  The budget costs 
associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the conservatorship of the 
mortgage-related GSEs, the American Rec overy and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (ARRA), 
and the effects of the recession on revenues and outlays have all contributed to the 
continued widening of the budget gap.  The deficit for the 12 months ending in June 
totaled almost $1.3 trillion, about $1 trillion larger than in th e same period a year earlier. 
Federal outlays, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and excluding fi nancial transactions 
such as those related to the TARP and the GSE conservatorship, we re 10 percent higher 
in the April–June period than a year earlier.   The surge in these outlays has primarily 
reflected an increase in stimulus-relate d spending and the rise in income-support 
payments as labor market conditions have deteriorated.
17  Notably, outlays for regular 
unemployment insurance benef its have soared, and payments for the temporary EUC 
program have been greater than anticipated last winter when the program was expanded.

18 While the 2009 stimulus plan is estimated to ha ve reduced individual income tax receipts by about 
$12 billion in the April–June period, the stimulus tax rebates in 2008 lowered individual taxes by about 
$50 billion during the same period last year.  In addition, the 2008 and 2009 stimulus packages reduced corporate income taxes by similar amounts in both years, largely through the temporary bonus depreciation 
provision.  Thus, tax cuts associated with fiscal stimulus actions have not contributed to the year-over-year 
decline in total tax receipts.  
In addition, the stimulus package has boosted fe deral aid to state and local governments.  
As measured in the NIPA, real federal expe nditures increased at an annual rate of 
11 percent in the second quarter, largely re flecting a sharp rebound in defense purchases 
from a relatively low level in the first quarter. 
Receipts in the April–June period dropped 24 percent relative to a year earlier as 
economic activity declined.18  Individual income and payroll taxes fell 20 percent, mostly 
reflecting the decrease in wages and sala ries and the likely lower capital gains 
realizations.  Corporate income taxes were s ubstantially lower than a year earlier, as 
corporate profits have fallen.

19 Although less than $1 billion in infrastructure funds had been distributed by the end of the second 
quarter, states may have used their own funds to finance projects in anticipation of stimulus funds expected 
later in the year. 
20 As noted in the appendix, the definition of the price index for PCE excluding food and energy has 
changed to include restaurant meal s.  Because the BEA released its monthly detail on PCE prices just 
before Greenbook publication, the coverage here is briefer than usual. State and Local Government Sector  
Real purchases by state and local government s rose at a relatively robust pace in the 
second quarter.  Following sharp drop-offs in th e previous two quarters, real investment 
spending rebounded in the second quarter, increasing at an estimated annual rate of about 
18 percent.  This substantial boost in spending is likely at tributable to a number of 
factors, including anticipatory spending of s timulus funds, easing of credit conditions in 
the municipal bond market, and signifi cant reductions in construction costs.19  However, 
these data are very volatile, and some of this  strength may be reversed in coming months.  
Hiring by state and local governments continues to be lackluster.  Employment gains in 
the second quarter averaged 4,000 per month, si gnificantly below the average of roughly 
16,000 per month in the previous five years. 
According to the Census Bureau, state tax revenues continued to plummet in the first 
quarter, falling about 12 percent relative to a year earlier.  The declines were widespread, 
with 45 out of 50 states experiencing a dr op in revenue.  The falloff in state revenues—
which was sharper than states expected—has left many states scrambling to close budget 
shortfalls for the current fiscal year.  For example, the California legislature recently 
approved a package to help close the estimat ed $26 billion budget shortfall that had 
opened up for the current fiscal year after having already implemented substantial budget 
cuts and tax increases in February. 
Prices  
Overall PCE prices moved up 0.5 percent in J une following little change in each of the 
previous three months.  The June pickup re flected a sizable jump in gasoline prices, 
stemming from the earlier increases in crude oil prices.  Over the 12 months ending in 
June, headline consumer prices declined about ½ percent, compared w ith a rise of about 
4 percent over the y ear-earlier period.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices increased 
0.2 percent in June; over the past 12 mont hs, these prices have risen 1½ percent.20 
Although energy prices jumped in June, the la test available survey data show that 
gasoline prices essentially flat tened out in July.  With crude  oil prices up from their

meals, which are now considered se rvices in the national accounts. average in June and July, reta il gasoline prices are likely to  rise somewhat over the next 
couple of months.  Spot prices for natural ga s have leveled out in recent months after 
plunging to very low levels this spring, and re tail prices for natural gas increased slightly 
in June following large declines in the first five  months of this year.  Consumer prices for 
electricity continued to fall in  June, as earlier declines in  fossil fuel input costs have 
continued to pass through to electricity rates. 
We estimate that PCE food prices flattened out in June after having fallen for five 
consecutive months, a pattern suggesting th at the pass-through from the dramatic 
downturn in spot prices of fa rm products in the second half of last year may now be 
complete.21  Spot prices for a wide variety of farm products moved up noticeably in the 
earlier part of this year, but many have retr eated, on balance, over the past two months.  
Futures prices, however, continue to point to increases in farm  prices over the rest of the 
year.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent in the 
first half of this year.  This pace reflects the net effect of a number of factors.  Low 
readings on nonmarket price in flation apparently pushed dow n core PCE price inflation 
significantly around the turn of th e year.  But the tax-related hi ke in tobacco prices this 
spring boosted core inflation noticeably.  In recent months, nonmarket prices have no 
longer been pushing down core inflation, and to bacco prices have changed little.  Both 
the overall index of core PCE prices and its market-based component rose 0.1 percent in 
May and 0.2 percent in June. Nearly all of the broad measures of inflati on have slowed over the past four quarters.  
Headline PCE prices in the second quarter we re slightly lower than a year earlier, 
compared with a rise of 3¾ percent in the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 
last year, and core PCE inflation stepped dow n from 2½ percent to 1½ percent.  The price 
index for gross domestic purchases has dece lerated considerabl y—by an amount similar 
to that for overall PCE prices—whereas cha nges in GDP prices, wh ich exclude the price 
of imported oil, have slowed by less over the past year. Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/Michigan survey, which stood at 
2.9 percent in the final July survey, have been  holding relatively steady in recent months 
after bouncing back from about 2 percent ar ound the turn of the year.  Longer-term 
expectations stood at 3.0 percent in July, about the same as the average over 2008.

22 The ECI benefits data are unpublished. 
23 The series for P&C hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector begins in 1949.  The actual 
data on P&C hourly compensation in the second quarter are scheduled to be released by the BLS on 
August 11. At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for co re intermediate materials turned up in June 
following a string of monthly declines that likely reflected pass-th rough from the large 
declines in spot commodity pr ices in the second half of la st year.  Commodity prices 
rebounded considerably over the first six months  of this year, and they have increased 
noticeably further since the June Greenbook.  In particular, the CRB index of spot 
industrial prices has risen about 10 per cent since the middle of June, and the Journal of  
Commerce  index of industrial materials has increa sed about 12½ percent.  Price increases 
have been widespread for industrial materials, with particularly large increases for prices 
of metals. 
Labor Costs 
All of our measures of hourly compensati on and wages suggest that labor costs have 
decelerated sharply this year in response to th e considerable deterioration in labor market 
conditions.  The ECI for private industry workers increased at an annual rate of only 
¾ percent in the first half of 2009 after having risen near ly 2½ percent in 2008.  The 
slowdown was broadly similar for both the wages and the benefits components of the index, with the step-down in benefits primarily reflecting a large drop in nonproduction bonuses.
22  After incorporating sizable changes to the wages and salary data in the 
comprehensive revision to the NIPA, we currently estimate that P&C hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector fe ll at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the 
first half of 2009 after having risen 2½ percent in 2008; if th ese estimates prove accurate, 
the decline in the first half of this ye ar would be the largest drop in nominal 
compensation on record.

1 The most important definitional change was the in corporation of a new classification structure for 
PCE.  In addition, the BEA changed its procedures for treating natural di sasters so that the components of 
national income—which are meant to capture income  from current production—are insulated from the 
direct effects of property damage. 
2 The rate of change of real GDP was revised up between 1997 and 2002, reflecting the incorporation 
of information from the 2002 input-output tables.  As  a result, the 2001 recession now looks a little milder 
than it did before. 
II-A-1 Comprehensive Revision of the Nati onal Income and Product Accounts 
The comprehensive revision of the national inco me and product accounts (NIPA) was released on 
July 31.  The revision reflected the incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of 
more-comprehensive source data as well as so me changes in methodology and definitions.1 
The most notable revision is that the four-qua rter change in real GDP was revised down by 
1 percentage point in 2008, to 1.9 percent, and by  nearly another 1 percentage point at an annual 
rate in 2009:Q1, to negative 6.4 percent.  Th ese downward revisions occurred in a variety of 
expenditure categories, with the largest c ontributions coming from personal consumption 
expenditures, net exports, and invent ory investment.  Revisions to the rates of change in real GDP 
in the preceding few years were small.2  The recent revisions make the recession look somewhat 
deeper than before, and they help reduce (but not eliminate) the tension between the published 
declines in real GDP and the labor market data.  The revisions also leave the change in GDP in 
2008 closer to that year’s change in gross domes tic income (GDI), though the change in GDI was 
also revised down in earlier years such that, on net, the statistical discrepancy was about unrevised in the first quarter. 
The change in real disposable personal income (DPI) was also revised downward over the past 
two years and especially in the first quarter, as new source data pointed to considerably greater weakness in both employee compensation and hous ehold receipts of dividend income.  In the 
1990s, however, real DPI is now estimated to ha ve been substantially higher, reflecting new 
estimates of unreported proprietors’ income, rental income, and the cost of so-called cafeteria benefits plans; this higher level of income ca rried forward.  Thus, the personal saving rate was 
revised up about 1 percentage point, on average, from the mid-1990s through 2007.  More recently, however, the downward revision to the change in real DPI was greater than the 
downward revision to real PCE, and the saving ra te is now reported to have increased less over 
the past year than before; ind eed, the saving rate was revised dow n slightly in 2009:Q1.  The 
level of corporate profits was also revised downward over the past few years, and the profit share of GNP is now about 1 percentage point lower than before.  
Given these new data, we now estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 
1 percent during 2008, a downward revision of ab out 1¼ percentage points.  In addition, we 
estimate that the change in compensation per hour  in the nonfarm business sector will be revised

3 The definitional change to core PCE prices was as sociated with the new classification structure for 
PCE in which restaurant meals were moved out of nondurable goods and into a new “food services” 
category; as noted, these food serv ices are now included in core PCE.  (For more discussion of the 
definitional changes to core and market-based PCE, see Deborah Lindner and David Lebow (2009), “Core PCE Price Inflation in the Upcoming Comprehensive Revision,” memorandum to the Federal Open Market 
Committee, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, 
July 15.) down sharply to an increase of only 2½ percent in  2008 and to a decline of 2½ percent at an 
annual rate in 2009:Q1.  With these revisions, compensation per hour now shows a clear and 
substantial deceleration over the past year, and we  estimate that unit labor costs will be reported 
to have declined over the past year.   
The BEA’s changes to its price indexes were gene rally small.  PCE inflation was revised down in 
2008 and again in the first quarter of 2009, prim arily reflecting new estimates for the change in 
the nonmarket component of prices.  Core PCE prices were affected by a change in definition, as 
restaurant meals are now included in core pri ces; core PCE price inflation generally revised 
slightly higher with this new definition.  Howe ver, despite the definitional change, core PCE 
inflation is now estimated to have been lower in the first quarter because of new lower estimates 
of the change in nonmarket prices.  The market -based component of core PCE prices underwent a 
more substantial change in de finition (involving the treatment of hospitals and other nonprofit 
institutions), and the change in these prices was revised up about ¼ percentage point per year, on average, over history.  Note that these defin itional changes to core PCE and market-based PCE 
did not affect overall PCE prices.

Domestic Financial Developments 
III-1   
 Overview 
Conditions in financial markets showed signs of continued improvement over the 
intermeeting period, as risk premiums gene rally narrowed and the functioning of short-
term funding markets improved a bit.  Broad stock price indexes ro se about 13 percent, 
reflecting strong second-quarter earnings re ports and indications that the economy is 
stabilizing.  Bank equity prices rose in line with the broader indexes.  Both the expected 
path of the funds rate as well as nominal Treasury yields were little changed over the 
period, while near-term inflation compensati on fell slightly.  Spreads on BBB-rated and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed furt her and are now a bit below their peak 
levels following the 2001 recession.  The spread over Treasury yields of the rates on 
conforming fixed-rate mortgages and adjustab le-rate mortgages decl ined, but the latter 
remained elevated. 
Bond and equity issuance by nonfinancial cor porations slowed in July, and outstanding 
bank loans to households and nonfinancial businesses continued to decline.  The 
available indicators suggest that household cred it quality deteriorated further in recent 
months, while indicators of business credit qua lity were mixed.  The July Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that demand weakened and 
banks continued to tighten standards and te rms on all major loan categories, although the 
net percentages of banks doing so declined further.  
Treasury Yields and Policy Expectations 
The expected path of the funds rate derived from futures quotes was little changed, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  Investors in itially marked up their policy expectations 
following the release of the June FOMC stat ement as they apparently interpreted the 
statement as suggesting a more favorable asse ssment of growth prospects than had been 
anticipated.  However, investors marked dow n the expected policy path after the June 
employment report and the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy testimony.  Market participants reportedly took not e of the comments indicating that monetary policy would 
be highly accommodative for an extended period and seemed more confident that the FOMC had the tools necessary to withdr aw policy accommodation in a smooth and 
timely manner when needed.  With our sta ndard term premium assumptions, futures 
quotes indicate that market participants cont inue to expect the ons et of policy tightening 
in the first quarter of 2010.  However, none of the respondents to the August primary dealer survey expect a rate incr ease before the second quarter of 2010.

 Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, despite sizeable intraday movements in  response to macroeconomic data releases 
and Federal Reserve communicatio ns.  The June employment report sent yields lower, 
while the stronger-than-expected reports on housing starts and manufacturing activity 
precipitated rate increases.  Option-implie d volatility on 10-year Treasury yields 
remained high, although it declined somewhat on balance. 
Five-year TIPS-based inflation compensation de clined about 15 basis points, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, while  five-year inflation compensation five years ahead 
increased about 25 basis points.  Changes in survey-based measures of inflation 
expectations were mixed. 
Financial Institutions 
Investor sentiment toward the financial se ctor improved further over the intermeeting 
period, boosted, in part, by second-qu arter earnings results that were generally better than 
expected at larger banking in stitutions.  Bank equity prices  rose about 17 percent over the 
period, and CDS spreads on financial firms d eclined.  Nonetheless, some investors 
commented that the positive upside surprises at  large financial instit utions were mostly 
related to investment banking and trading ac tivities, which are less prominent sources of 
revenue at smaller or regional institutions, and mortgage refinanc ing activity, which may 
recede if longer-term rates rise.  Market par ticipants also focused on the large consumer 
loan losses reported by many banks.   
The financial condition of CIT Group, Inc., one  of the largest lenders to middle-market 
firms, worsened sharply over the period.  After failing to receive government support, 
CIT obtained $3 billion in pr ivate financing on July 20 from some of its largest existing 
bondholders.   While reports suggest that CI T has averted a near-term funding crisis, 
prices of CDS contracts on CIT indicate that the risk of ba nkruptcy continues to be very 
high.  Broader conditions in financial markets have to date remained largely unaffected 
by these developments. 
Short-Term Funding Markets 
Functioning in short-term funding markets generally showed further improvement over 
the intermeeting period.  Consis tent with a reduction in c oncerns about the financial 
condition of large banking institutions, Libor rates continued to edge down.  Three- and 
six-month Libor-OIS spreads— while still somewhat elevat ed by historical standards—
declined a bit further and stand at levels last recorded in early 2008.  The changes to

1  The Federal Reserve announced the extension of the AMLF, CPFF, PDCF, TSLF, and the temporary 
reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) through February 1, 2010.  Auctions under the TSLF 
Schedule 1 and TSLF Options Program were suspended. The frequency of Schedule 2 TSLF auctions was 
reduced to one every four weeks and the offered amount was reduced. The authorization for the MMIFF was not extended, and an additional administrative criterion was established for use of the AMLF.  In view of the decreasing need for TAF funding, the amounts auctioned at the biweekly auctions of TAF funds was reduced from $150 billion to $125 billion for auctions after July 13.  On July 24, these amounts were 
further reduced to $100 billion. 
     
 
 Regulation D that became effective on July 2 appeared to have only a small effect on 
trading in the overnight  federal funds market. 
Bid-asked spreads for most types of repurchas e agreem ents ticked down.  Since the June 
Greenbook, spreads on A2/P2-rated
 commercia l paper and AA-rated ABCP were little 
changed, on net, remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past two years.  
Outstanding commercial paper in the CPFF declined from roughly $110 billion to  
$60 billion in July, as only 40 percent of the volume of maturing paper coming due was 
rolled back into the facility.  
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Re serve assets remained around $2 trillion, as 
an increase in securities held roughly offset declines in funds supplied un der credit and 
liquidity facilities.  Around $59 billion in Treasury securiti es was purchased, including 
$1.5 billion in TIPS, bringing the total amount  of purchases to about $227 billion.  
Further, the Federal Reserve purchased about  $12 billion in agency debt and about 
$124 billion in agency MBS.  Market comment ary and the results of the August primary 
dealer survey suggest that investors expect no modifications to Federal Reserve purchase 
programs at the upcoming FOMC meeting. 
On June 25, the Federal Reserve announced exte nsions of and m odifications to a number 
of its liquidity programs.1  Reaction in financial market s to the announcement was muted, 
and participation in these facilities generally  continued to decline over the intermeeting 
period.  TALF loans backed by asset-backed securities totaled $5.4 billion in July, and 
loans backed by legacy commercial mortgage -backed securities equaled $636 million.  
No requests for loans to finance new-issue CMBS were submitted.   
III-5 
 
 
  Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes rose  about 13 percent, on net, ove r the intermeeting period, as 
investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the 
economy may be stabilizing.  The spread between  the staff’s estimate of the expected real 
equity return over the next 10 years for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real 10-year 
Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity risk  premium—narrowed a bit but remained high 
by recent historical standards.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index also declined a bit further.  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on BBB-rated and speculative- grade corporate bonds 
declined about 80 and 140 basis points, resp ectively.  As a result, corporate bond spreads 
narrowed further and are now below the p eak levels reached in 2002 following the 
previous recession.  Excluding eff ects related to CIT, staff es timates of bid-asked spreads 
for both investment-grade and speculative-gr ade corporate bonds were  little changed.  
Conditions in the leveraged loan market contin ued to improve as secondary-market prices 
rose further and bid-asked spreads narrowed. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With most reports in hand and analyst estimates for the rest, operating earnings per share 
for S&P 500 firms in the second quarter are estimated to have come in about 25 percent below year-earlier levels, less negative than fi rst-quarter growth. The four-quarter rate of 
decline for nonfinancial firms in the index al so appears to have turned up.  In addition, 
the data suggest that, on a nons easonally adjusted quarter-over-quarter basis, operating 
earnings rose substantially in the second quarter, for bot h nonfinancial as well as 
financial constituents.  Moreover, both the financial and nonfinancial reports were substantially stronger th an market participants had expect ed, with about three-fourths of 
the reports exceeding analysts’ expectations—a high share by historical standards.  The 
magnitude of the positive surprises was also la rge.  In contrast, reported revenues were 
close to analyst estimates on average, an i ndication that the earnings news primarily 
reflects larger-than-anticipated cost reduc tions.  Companies’ gui dance about future 
earnings has been neutral overall, and an index of revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year-
ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms turned sli ghtly positive over the past two months after 
having been deeply negative for more than a year.  
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial  firms were mixed.  Th e aggregate ratio of 
debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations rose in the first quarter, as did the aggregate 
liquid asset ratio.  Moody’s ra tings downgrades of corporate bonds of nonfinancial

 companies continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the second quarter, but the pace 
of deterioration moderated some from that observed in the first quarter.  The expected 
default frequency for nonfinancial firms fr om Moody’s KMV dropped in July to about 
one-half of its peak level earlier in the year, as stock price gains tr anslated into higher 
estimated asset values and lower leverage. Th e six-month trailing bond default rate ticked 
up in June with the default of General Motors. 
Business Finance 
Gross speculative-grade and investment-grade bond issuance by nonfinancial 
corporations slowed in July from its out sized second-quarter pace.  Issuance of 
institutional loans in the syndicated leveraged loan market reportedly continued to be 
extremely weak.  Meanwhile, bank loans and commercial paper continued to run off, 
leaving net debt financing by nonfin ancial corporations at around zero. 
The pace of gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms, both from seasoned and 
initial-public offerings, slowed in July following a very robust second quarter.  Equity retirements from cash-financed mergers and es timated share repurchases were modest in 
the first quarter and outpaced by issuance.  As a result, net equity issuance in the first quarter was positive for the first time since 2002.  In the second quarter, announcements 
of mergers and acquisitions and new share repurchase programs remained weak. Equity issuance by financial firms slowed to a trickle in July after ba llooning in the second 
quarter, when banks raised most of the equ ity capital required by the SCAP and many 
other financial institutions sold additional shares.  Financial bond issuance was solid, 
with only about 20 percent issued under the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. 
Commercial Real Estate  
Commercial real estate mark ets have remained under considerable strain.  Outstanding 
commercial mortgage debt was roughly flat in  the first quarter, th e weakest performance 
since 1995, and bank balance sheet data point to a further contraction in the second 
quarter.  Sales of commercial properties continued to drop in the second quarter, with the 
monthly average now at levels last seen at the beginning of this decade. Moreover, nearly 40 percent of properties were sold at a nomin al loss.  Commercial real estate prices 
dropped again in May and June, leaving the price indexes about one-third lower than 
their peak levels in 2007.  The delinquency  rate on securitized commercial mortgages 
shot up further in June from its already elev ated level in May, in part owing to the 
bankruptcy of General Growth Properties.

 Commercial mortgage CDS spreads narrowed ov er the intermeeting period, primarily in 
response to two policy actions and announcem ents.  The first CMBS subscription in 
TALF, though small in size, apparently reduced  the uncertainty regarding the criteria the 
Federal Reserve would apply to reject leg acy CMBS.  In addition, the announcement that 
the Public-Private Investment Program would finance investment in AAA-rated CMBS 
bonds that had been downgraded and thus were  ineligible for legacy TALF financing 
reportedly helped mitigate much of the negative effects of recent downgrades by rating agencies.  
Household Finance 
The rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate  mortgages dropped back below 5½ percent 
over the intermeeting period, with its spread  to the 10-year Treasury yield narrowing 
slightly.  The spread of the yield on the 5/ 1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) over 
the 2-year Treasury yield declined but remained elevated.  Issuance of MBS by the 
housing-related GSEs was about the same in May as in April.  MBS issuance by Ginnie 
Mae grew slightly in May, while the priv ate-label MBS market remained shuttered. 
Home prices showed some signs of stabiliz ation in April and May.  The Federal Housing 
Finance Agency index and the LoanPerfor mance national index dropped 6 percent and 
9 percent, respectively, over the year ending in May, while the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city index posted a decline of 17 percent over th e same period.  Monthly readings on the 
LoanPerformance index actually increased in  March, April, and May, though the monthly 
data are particularly noisy and subject to  large revisions.  Delinquency rates of both 
prime and subprime mortgages continued to rise. 
Issuance of consumer ABS has reached its pr e-crisis levels, mainly driven by TALF-
financed issues.  Spreads on AAA-rate d ABS were about unchanged over the 
intermeeting period and remained well below their peaks at the end of 2008.  Interest 
rates on new auto loans were about flat in th e second quarter at leve ls well below those 
seen earlier this year, and in terest rates on credit cards we re little changed in May.  
Delinquency rates on auto loans at captive fina nce companies rose a little in April and 
May; delinquency rates on credit card loans were little changed over the same period and 
remain near their highest levels in more than a decade. Possibly reflecting an improvement in risk appetites—and perhaps stimulated by recent 
outsized returns—long-term mutual funds, par ticularly bond funds, attr acted considerable

 inflows in June and July.  In contrast, m oney market mutual funds saw net outflows over 
the same period as yields on these funds remained extremely low. 
Treasury and Agency Finance 
Over the intermeeting period, ten auctions of  Treasury securities totaling $252 billion 
were held.  Although the auctions were for record amounts, they were generally well 
received early in the intermeeting period, with  bid-to-cover ratios near or above recent 
levels.  Foreign demand at these auctions also  appeared solid.  However, auctions for the 
two- and five-year notes during the week of July 27 were met with tepid demand.  In its 
midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasu ry indicated that its financing needs 
likely would require gradually increasing auction sizes and making potential changes in 
the auction calendar and in the range of benchmark securities  offered.  The Treasury also 
indicated that TIPS issuance w ould likely increase in fisc al year 2010 and that it is 
considering replacing the 20-year TIPS with  a 30-year TIPS.  Changes to the TIPS 
program will be announced in November.  Fina lly, the Treasury noted that it expects to 
reach the debt ceiling in  the last quarter of  this calendar year. 
Indicators of Treasury market functioning were little changed over the intermeeting 
period, and functioning continues to be somewhat impaired.  However, fitting errors from 
the staff’s nominal yield curve model continued to shrink and are now at levels similar to 
those seen in early 2008, pointing to improve d market performance.  Bid-asked spreads 
held roughly steady, and trading volumes remain low.  The staff’s measure of the on-the-run liquidity premium for the 10- year Treasury note was little changed at elevated levels, 
although well below its peak last fall.   
Auctions of agency debt were generally well received during the intermeeting period.  
The spread between yields on senior a nd subordinated agency debt narrowed 
significantly following the announcement by Fr eddie Mac that it would be tendering 
offers for all of its outstanding subordinate d debt.  On July 20, Freddie Mac announced 
the pricing of the tender offers and reported that it tendered nearly $3.9 billion of its 
$4.4 billion of outstanding subordi nated debt.  Market partic ipants reportedly expect 
Fannie Mae to follow suit by buying back its subordinated debt. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Conditions in the municipal bond market were  little changed over the intermeeting 
period.  Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was solid in July, mostly driven by 
the strength in new capital issuance.  Short-te rm issuance was moderate, consistent with

 typical seasonal patterns.  Yi elds on long-term municipal bonds were little changed over 
the intermeeting period, as were their ratios to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities.  Rating upgrades in  the second quarter continue d to outpace downgrades, as 
rating agencies continued to implement change s to the rating scale for municipal credits 
toward the more lenient corporate scale.  On July 14, Moody’s lowered California's credit 
rating from A2 to Baa1. However, on July 24, the state reached a deal to close its 
$26 billion budget gap, alleviating concern of near-term further deterioration of the 
state’s credit quality.  Investor s reportedly remain concerned about the state’s longer-term 
budget.   
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 increased slightly, on net, over the past  two months.  Retail money market mutual 
funds and small time deposits dropped sharply in June and are estimated to have 
contracted again in July, likely reflecting the ve ry low rates of intere st on these assets and 
a continued reallocation of wealth toward riskier assets.  These declines were partly offset by net growth of liquid deposits, suggesting some  portfolio reallocation within M2 assets 
as well.  Currency growth was also wea k, on balance, which re portedly reflects soft 
foreign demand with global economic conditions stabilizing.  The monetary base declined appreciably in June and July because  of a reduction in use of liquidity and credit 
facilities that more than offset continued large-scale asset purchases.  
Commercial bank credit contracted further in June and July, as all major loan categories 
declined.  Core loans fell at an 8¾ percen t pace, on average, reflecting weaker demand 
for most types of loans, some substitution from bank loans to other funding sources, and 
an ongoing tightening of lending standards and terms.  C&I loans dropped steeply amid 
subdued origination activity and broad-based paydow ns of outstanding loans.  In the July 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, res pondents indicated that the most important 
reasons for the decline in C&I loans this year were weaker demand from creditworthy 
borrowers and the deterioration in credit quality that has redu ced the number of firms that 
respondents viewed as creditworthy.  The cont raction in commercial real estate lending 
accelerated, as large fractions of respondents in the July survey again noted tighter 
standards.  While that fraction was down so mewhat from the April survey, it remained 
higher than the fraction for any other loan category aside from nontraditional mortgages. 
Regarding lending to households, residential real estate loans are estimated to have 
contracted in July for the fourth straight m onth, in part because of a continued rapid pace 
of securitizations and loan sa les to the GSEs.  The contraction in home equity lending 
III-20 
 
 steepened in June and Ju ly, likely owing in part to further reductions in the credit lines of 
existing customers over the past few months, as indicated in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  The stock of consumer loans originated by banks continued to shrink at 
a moderate pace in June and July, while on-balance-sheet holdings decreased more rapidly.  The decline in consumer loans is consistent with weaker demand and some further tightening of standards and terms.

1 Respondent banks received the survey on or after Ju ly 14, 2009, and their responses were due on July 
28, 2009. 
2 For questions that ask about lending standards, reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
banks that reported tightening standards (“tightened considerably” or “tightened somewhat”) minus the 
percentage of banks that reported easing standards (“eased considerably” or “eased somewhat”).  For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net percen tages equal the percentage of banks that reported 
stronger demand (“substantially stronger” or “moderately stronger”) minus the percentage of banks that 
reported weaker demand (“substantially  weaker” or “moderately weaker”). Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
The July 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opin ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and households  over the past three 
months.  The survey also included two sets of speci al questions:  The first set asked banks to rank 
the causes of declines this year in commercial and industrial (C&I) lending, and the second set 
asked banks about their expectations for lending st andards relative to norms over the past decade.  
This appendix is based on responses from 55 domest ic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies 
of foreign banks.1 
In the July survey, domestic banks indicated that  they continued to tighten standards and terms 
over the past three months on all major types of loans to businesses and households, although the 
net percentages of banks that tightened declined compared to the April survey.2  Demand for 
loans continued to weaken across all major categories except for prime residential mortgages.  
The fraction of domestic banks reporting additional weakening in  demand in this survey was 
slightly less than in the April survey for C&I lo ans and home equity lines of credit, approximately 
the same for commercial real est ate (CRE) and nontraditional residential mortgages, and slightly 
more for consumer loans.  
In response to a special question on the sources of decline in C&I lending this year, domestic 
banks ranked decreased loan demand and deteri orating credit quality as the most important 
sources.  In response to a second special question, most banks expected their lending standards to remain tighter than average across all lending categories until at least the second half of 2010; for below-investment-grade firms and nonprime househol ds, the expected timing is later, with many 
banks reporting that standards for such borrowers  will remain tighter than average for the 
foreseeable future.  On balance, the largest banks  generally expected lending standards to remain 
stringent for longer than other banks. 
Lending to Businesses 
Questions on commercial and industrial lending.  About 30 percent of domestic respondents, 
on net, reported tightening standards on C&I loans to large firms.  That percentage is roughly

10 percentage points lower than in the April su rvey, continuing the declining trend that began 
after the measure reached a peak of roughly 85 percent in the November 2008 survey.  Standards 
on C&I loans to small firms were reported as havi ng been tightened by a net fraction of about 
35 percent of domestic respondents, down from a bove 40 percent in April and 70 percent in 
January.  
 
 
 Tightening of the various terms on C&I loans by do mestic respondents conti nued, but, in general, 
the net fractions that reported tightening con tinued to fall from their highs in late 2008.  
Approximately 60 percent, on net, reported increasing spreads of loan rates for large firms, 
compared with 80 percent in April.  For small firms, about 65 percent reported increasing spreads, compared with 75 percent in April.  These movements contrast with the narrowing in corporate bond spreads over the same period.  Signi ficant net fractions of respondents continued 
to report tightening of other price terms on loans to firms of all sizes; in particular, the costs of 
credit lines and premiums charged on riskier loans were reported as having been tightened by net 
fractions in excess of 50 percent of respondents. 
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also reported tightening their business lending stance 
further over the past three months.  For C&I lendi ng, the net percentage that reported having done 
so was again lower than in the previous survey.  About 15 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported tightening credit standards for C&I loans, compared with 30 percent in April and 65 percent in January.  Regarding lending terms,  about 30 percent of foreign banks, on net, 
reported increasing the costs of credit lines, comp ared with 65 percent in April.  The net 
percentage of foreign respondents that repor ted increasing premiums on riskier loans was  
30 percent, down from 70 percent in April.  In addition, about 15 percent of foreign banks reported increasing the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds, down from about 60 percent 
in April.   
The predominant reasons banks gave for tightening credit standards or terms for C&I loans 
resembled those reported in the previous two su rveys.  Both domestic and foreign respondents 
nearly unanimously cited a less favorable or  more uncertain economic outlook and large 
majorities cited a reduced tolerance for risk.  Domestic respondents also widely noted a 
worsening of industry-specific problems, while fo reign respondents were more likely to cite an 
increase in defaults by borrowers in public debt markets, as well as deterioration in their banks’ current or expected capital positions.  The net fr action of foreign banks reporting concern over 
decreased liquidity in the secondary market fo r C&I loans fell substantially to 30 percent from 
about 70 percent in the April survey.  
Considerable net fractions of domestic respondents again reported weaker demand for C&I loans 
from firms of all sizes.  About 45 percent of  domestic respondents reported weaker demand for 
C&I loans to large firms, on net, and 55 percent indicated weaker demand from small firms; these 
figures are somewhat lower than the April figures of 60 and 65 percent for large and small firms,

 respectively.  About one-fourth of reporting fo reign banks, on net, indicated weaker demand for 
C&I loans, in contrast to the April survey, in  which these banks reported that demand was about 
unchanged, on net.  
Both foreign and domestic respondents unanimous ly  cited a decreased financing need by 
customers for investment in plant or equipm ent as a reason for weaker demand for C&I loans 
over the past three months. The other predomin ant reasons for weaker demand included decreases 
in the need to finance inventories, accounts recei vable, and mergers or acquisitions.  On net, 
about 25 percent of domestic banks reported th at inquiries from potential business borrowers had 
declined during the survey period,  slightly less than was reported in April.  A little more than  
15 percent of foreign banks reported a decline in such inquiries, an increase from the April 
survey.  
Special Question on Commercial and Industrial Lending  
The July survey included a special question on C&I lending.  To gather information about the 
effects of supply and demand in the market for C&I loans, the survey asked banks to rank the 
relative importance of five potential sources of the decline in C&I lending this year.  According 
to domestic banks, the most important factor, on average, was lower loan demand from 
creditworthy borrowers because their funding need s have declined, followed by deteriorating 
credit quality of potential borrowers.  Foreign ba nks, in contrast, ranked lower loan demand due 
to reduced funding needs third, and listed de teriorating credit quality as the most important 
reason, followed by tighter bank lending standard s.  Despite strong corporate bond issuance over 
the past few months and improved functioning in the commercial paper markets, both domestic and foreign banks indicated that one of the least  two important factors (among those listed on the 
survey) was the availability of other sources of f unding.  Respondents also indicated that higher 
spreads and fees were relatively unimportant.  
Questions on commercial real estate lending.   The fraction of domestic respondents that 
reported tightening standards on CRE loans fell to a bout 45 percent, compared with 65 percent in 
April.  Still, t
his fraction is higher than that  reported for C&I loans and all consumer lending 
categories except nontraditional residential mortgage s.  About 45 percent of foreign banks also 
reported tightening standards on CRE loans, a slight  increase from the figure reported in April.  
The net percentage of domestic respondents th at reported weaker demand for CRE loans fell 
slightly to roughly 65 percent, but it remained la rge by historical standards and relative to other 
loan categories.  About 45 percent of foreign r espondents also reported weaker demand, a slight 
increase from the April survey.

of existing mortgages.  
 
 
 resumed declining from its peak level of about 75 percent one year ago.  The measure fell 
approximately 25 percentage points in this su rvey to roughly 20 percent.  For the second 
consecutive survey, domestic banks reported increased demand from prime borrowers for 
residential mortgages; however, consistent with the recent reduction in refinancing activity, the net fraction fell to 15 percent from 35 percent in April.
3  The net fraction of respondents that 
tightened standards on nontraditional residential mortgages fell to roughly 45 percent from  65 percent in April.  The net fraction that repor ted weaker demand for such mortgages was little 
changed at around 15 percent.   
The net fraction of domestic banks that repor ted tighte
 ning their lending standards on home 
equity lines of credit fell to roughly 30 percent from 50 percent in the April survey, and the 
fraction of banks reporting weaker demand for home equity lines of credit decreased to about  15 percent from 30 percent in the April survey. 
Questions on consumer lending.  For the second consecutive survey, domestic banks reported 
little change in their willingness to make consumer installment loans. The net fraction of domestic banks that reported tighter credit card lending standards fell significantly from nearly  60 percent to around 35 percent.  Similarly, th e net fraction of domestic banks that reported 
tighter standards on consumer loans other than  credit cards declined to 35 percent from 
45 percent in April.  For both credit card and other consumer loans, domestic banks continued to report tightening of loan terms and conditions, alth ough the net fractions of banks that tightened 
were not as high as in April. The net fraction of  domestic banks reporting weaker demand for all 
types of consumer loans rose a few pe rcentage points to about 20 percent. 
Questions on existing credit lines.  As in the April survey, significant net fractions of 
respondents reported decreasing the sizes of credit lines for existing customers on all types of business and consumer accounts surveyed.  Neve rtheless, these net percentages edged down for 
all categories of credit lines. 
Special Questions on the Levels of Lending Standards 
A set of special questions asked domestic banks a bout the level of their current lending standards 
relative to the average level over the past decade (longer-term average) and about their 
expectations for this relative level in the future .   Most of the recurring survey questions ask 
banks about changes in the levels of their lending standards over the past three months rather than 
about the levels of their lending standards.  Because recent survey responses have indicated 
widespread tightening of standa rds, these special questions were intended to elicit information 
about whether banks have responded to the curre nt economic downturn by pushing the level of

4 Because of data limitations, weights correspond to loan types but not to cred it quality categories.  For 
example, the loan amounts used to calculate the weighted distribution of responses for investment-grade 
C&I lending standards are the same weights used to calculate the distribution of responses for non-
investment-grade C&I lending standards. their lending standards above the longer-term averag e and, if so, whether the elevated level of 
standards is expected to persist for some time.   
For C&I loans to investment-grade firms, 50 pe rcent of the respondents reported that their 
standards were tighter than the longer-term average but were expected to return to average levels 
by the end of 2010 or earlier.  In addition, 25 pe rcent of respondents indicated that standards on 
investment-grade C&I loans were not tighter than  the longer-term average.  Around 20 percent of 
respondents indicated that they expected C&I lending standards for both investment-grade and 
non-investment-grade C&I loans to remain tight er than their longe r-term average for the 
foreseeable future.  When weighted by outstanding C&I loan amounts on banks’ books, this 
measure rose to nearly 25 percent for both credit quality classifications.4 
With respect to CRE lending standards, nearly a ll banks indicated that current standards were 
tighter than their longer-term average levels.  Ar ound 40 percent expected standards to return to 
longer-term average levels by the second half of 2010 or in 2011 for bot h investment-grade and 
non-investment-grade lending.  However, 40 per cent indicated that standards for investment-
grade CRE lending would remain tighter than their longer-term average levels into the foreseeable future, and about 55 percent expect ed this outcome for non-investment-grade CRE 
loans. 
For prime residential real estate lending (incl uding home equity lines of credit), of the 
respondents that reported that standards were cu rrently tighter than longer-term average levels, 
about one-half expected standards to return to tho se levels by the end of 2011, with most of those 
expecting a return by the second half of 2010.  Wh en weighted by residential real estate loans on 
banks’ books, however, the fraction that indicated standards would indefinitely remain tighter 
than their longer-term average leve ls rose from less than one-half to more than three-fourths.  The 
comparable measure for nonprime standards was about 60 percent unweighted, and about  
80 percent when weighted. 
With respect to prime credit card borrowers, in the unweighted analysis, roughly one-third of 
respondents expected standards to remain tighter  that their longer-term average levels for the 
foreseeable future, while one-fourth  expected a return to longer-ter m average levels in 2011, and  
one-fourth expected a return earlier than 2011.  Lending standards for nonprime credit card 
borrowers were expected to remain tight for a lo nger period, with two-thirds of respondents not 
expecting a return to longer-term average levels for the foreseeable future.  When weighted by 
credit card loans on banks’ books, about 80 per cent of respondents reported that credit card 
lending standards would remain tighter than averag e for the foreseeable future for both prime and 
III-A-10 
  nonprime borrowers.  The weighted analysis also showed that almost all respondents with large 
credit card operations considered credit card lending standards to be tighter than the average over 
the past decade.   
When asked about expected lending standards fo r ot her consumer loans to prime and nonprime 
borrowers, 25 percent and about 20 percent of res pondents, respectively, reported that standards 
for such loans were not tighter than longer-ter m average levels.   Another 50 percent and  
25 percent of respondents, respectively, indicated that standards for consumer loans to prime and 
nonprime borrowers were tighter than longer-term average levels but would ease by the end of 
2011 or earlier.  Weighting by on-balance-sheet loans, however, again indicated much smaller 
percentages of loans at banks for which respondent s either expect standards to ease in the nearer 
term or view standards as not currently tighter than average.  For prime borrowers, nearly  
65 percent of outstanding other consumer loans we re held by respondents that did not see their 
standards for other consumer loans easing to longe r-term average levels in the foreseeable future, 
and only 10 percent of loans were held by responde nts that reported prime lending standards were 
not tighter than longer-term average levels.  For nonprime borrowers on a weighted basis, about 
85 percent of other consumer loans were held  by respondents that did not expect lending 
standards for these loans to ease to longer-term average levels in the foreseeable future, and around 5 percent of other consumer loans were held by banks that indicated their nonprime 
standards on such loans were not tight er than longer-term average levels.

Trade in Goods and Services 
In May, the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $26 billion, the smallest deficit 
since 1999, as exports increased mode rately and imports declined.  
The value of exports of goods and services ro se 1.6 percent in May after falling 2 percent 
in April.  The May increase was led by a climb in exports of industrial supplies, 
particularly of petroleum pr oducts, and reflected both higher prices and greater volumes.  
Exports of capital goods and consumer goods  rose modestly, whereas automotive 
products and services fell.  
Despite the May increase, th e average value of exports in April and May declined 
8.5 percent at an annual rate from the fi rst quarter, with exports of capital goods 
recording the most pronounced weakness.  Most  other major categories of exports also 
declined, with only industrial supplies and agricultural goods showing increases, helped 
by higher commodity prices.

  The value of imports of goods and services fell 0.6 percent in May, a deceleration from 
April’s 1.5 percent decline.  Imports of petr oleum products exhibite d the largest decline 
in May, with the fall wholly reflecting lower volumes, as petroleum prices rose.  Imports 
of services and automotive products moved down a touch, while industrial supplies were 
flat.  Overall imports of consumer goods were also flat, as a large decline in 
pharmaceuticals offset increases in a number of other goods.  In contrast, imports of 
computers moved up strongly.    
The average value of imports in April and Ma y fell 14 percent at an annual rate from the 
first quarter.  Lower imports of industrial supplies and capital goods accounted for most 
of the decline, but services and automotive products also declin ed.  In contrast, imports of 
consumer goods and petroleum recorded small increases.   
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   In June, prices of imported core goods rose 0.2 percent, following a 
0.3 percent increase in May.  The June incr ease reflected higher prices for material-
intensive goods, which rose 0.6 percent.  Within that category, higher prices for 
unfinished metals led to an increase in prices for industr ial supplies, and prices for 
imported foods also rose.  Prices for fini shed goods edged up, increasing 0.1 percent 
across all major categories.  
The average level of core import prices in the second quarter was 1.2 percent (a.r.) below 
the first-quarter aver age, a much smaller drop than th e 11.3 percent decline observed in 
the first quarter.  One factor contributing to the difference was a deceleration in prices of 
material-intensive goods, which fell only 2.6 pe rcent in the second qua rter after having 
fallen 30.1 percent in the first quarter.  Likewi se, prices for finished  goods fell less in the 
second quarter than in the firs t.  In contrast, prices for capital goods excluding computers 
and semiconductors fell more rapidly in the second quarter, dr opping 1.6 percent after 
having declined only 0.7 per cent in the first quarter.  
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price inde x of imported oil rose for a fifth straight 
month, increasing more than 20 percent in June.  The spot price of West Texas 
intermediate (WTI) cr ude oil rose by a similar amount, averaging just less than $70 per 
barrel for the month as a whole.  In July, th e price of spot WTI wa s volatile but, on net, 
was little changed, and closed most recently on August 4 at $71.42 per barrel.  The lack 
IV-5 
of change of oil prices on balance reflects the offsetting of positive news regarding global 
economic activity by high global crude and pe troleum product inventories and increased 
OPEC production.

  Exports.   Core export prices jumped 1.4 percent in June after incr easing 0.7 percent in 
May.  Prices for material-intensive goods rose 2.9 percent, le d by higher prices for 
agricultural exports.  Prices for finished goods rose 0.2 percent, as higher prices for 
capital goods excluding computers and semi conductors and for consumer goods offset 
falling prices for automotive products.   
The average level of core export prices in  the second quarter was up 3.1 percent at an 
annual rate from the first-quarter average.  The rise can be attributed to the 20.8 percent 
increase in prices of agricultural products, which had fallen at a 12.3 percent pace in the 
first quarter.  For non-agricultural industrial su pplies, after a 28.4 percent price decline in 
the first quarter, prices were up 2 percent in the second quarter.  Prices of exported 
finished goods firmed 0. 5 percent on balance.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received  Treasury data on inte rnational financial 
transactions for May and June that support th e view that tensions in financial markets 
eased in those months.  Private investors both  in the United States and abroad appear to 
have resumed purchases of riskier cross-border securities.  Foreign pr ivate investors have 
also resumed their purchases of U.S. Treasur ies.  Foreign offici al inflows picked up 
further in May and June and the more r ecent custody data from FRBNY suggest they 
weakened only slightly in July. 
  Notwithstanding their strong demand for Treasur ies in June, foreign private investors’ 
purchases of U.S. Treasuries in the second quarter were well below those in the first 
quarter and the second half of last year (see  line 4a of the table “Summary of U.S. 
International Transactions” and the upper pane ls of the figure “Pri vate Securities Flows 
through June 2009”).  However, foreign private investors’ purchases of U.S. stocks picked up smartly in the second quarter, with large purchases in May and June (line 4d).  
Foreign investors sold little U.S. agency a nd corporate debt, on net, in May and June, in 
marked contrast to the large net sales record ed since last summer (lines 4b and 4c). 
 Similarly, U.S. investors made sizable purch ases of foreign secu rities in the second 
quarter (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through June 2009”), a significant swing from the net sales reco rded in the second half  of last year.   
 Foreign official inflows in the second quarter were well above the pace of the first quarter 
(see line 1 of the table “Summary of U.S. In ternational Transactions”) and exceeded their 
2007-08 rate.   
 
. As has been the case since 
last summer, official inflows continue to be overwhelmingly into U.S. Treasury securities (see the figure “Foreign Official Financial Inflows through June 2009”).  FRBNY 
custody data indicate that offi cial acquisitions of  U.S. Treasuries remained strong in 
July, although total official in flows appear to have weakened  a touch as most countries 
reduced their holdings of agencies.  Amounts outstanding of the Fed’s central ba nk liquidity swaps have declined to 
$76 billion as of July 31; the unwinding of thes e swaps is recorded as a reduction in U.S. 
official claims on foreigners (line 2).  U.S. banks conti nued to lend abroad in June 

IV-10 
 (line 3), allowing foreign banks to reduce thei r draws on the swap lines.  A slight upward 
trend in gross cross-border ba nk claims (not shown), also reflects this reengagement.

 Foreign Financial Markets 
Stock markets rose globally, on net, and th e dollar depreciated mildly against most 
currencies as positive U.S. earnings reports a nd news of strong growth in emerging Asia 
lifted investor sentiment.  European and Japanese stock indexes have increased roughly 9 
and 6 percent, respectively, since the June Greenbook.  European bank stocks rose about 
17 percent, spurred by early reports of better-than-expected profits among some 
European banks as well as by strong earni ngs reports from some U.S. financial 
institutions.  Mutual fund flows to the EM Es turned positive after a brief period of 
outflows in late June; emerging Asian stock markets have increased  8 to 25 percent, 
while emerging Latin American stock markets ha ve increased 2 to 15 percent.  Since the 
June Greenbook, the dollar has depreciated a bout 4 percent on a tr ade-weighted basis 
against the major foreign currencies and about 1 percent against the currencies of other 
important trading partners of the United States. 
Overnight interest rates in the euro area have  declined to about 35 basis points in the 
wake of the June 24 injection by the European  Central Bank (ECB) of one-year funds at a 
fixed rate of 1 percent.  Banks took dow n a record €442 billion in the operation, 
increasing euros outstanding from ECB refinancing operations 45 percent.  The ECB also 
began its purchases of covered bonds, buying roughly €5 billion of bonds so far.  Yields 
on intermediate-term European covered bonds  have declined roughly 30 basis points 
since the purchases began in early July.  In contrast, yields on longer-dated gilts rose as much as 19 basis points immediately after th e Bank of England (BOE) surprised markets 
by leaving the size of its Asset Purchase Faci lity (APF) unchanged at  £125 billion at its 
July MPC meeting.  Gilt yields continued to edge higher as the ba nk’s purchases neared 
their limit under the facility, which was reached  last week; however, the completion of 
purchases, which was expected, had little appa rent impact on the gilt market.  Market 
participants were divided as to whether the BOE would author ize any further purchases at 
its August meeting, but the MPC decided to renew its purchases just as the Greenbook 
closed.  Citing the depth of the recession, the BOE raised the size of the APF to 
£175 billion and widened the set of gilts it w ould purchase, stating that it expected to 
conduct its additional purchases over the next three months. Benchmark gilt yields fell about 20 basis points on the announcement. 
Although the BOE may yet choose to make further use of its Asset Purchase Facility, 
bank officials have begun to publicly discu ss the outlines of a possible exit strategy; 
Deputy Governor Charles Bean disclosed th at it was quite likely that the BOE would 
raise its benchmark interest rate before selling any securities  acquired through the 
IV-15 
 
  Facility.  ECB officials have also begun to publicly discuss the outlines of an eventual 
exit strategy–ECB Vice President Lucas Papade mos stated that the decision to drain 
excess liquidity need not be made before intere st rates were raised.  He also implied that 
the ECB would eventually revert to its pre-crisis method of conducting refinancing 
operations, in which it auctioned fixed amounts of funds that banks compete to borrow, 
rather than offering funds in whatever quantities banks demand at fixed rates. 
Spreads between euro and sterling Libor a nd corresponding overnight index swap rates 
have declined since the June Greenbook, a nd functioning in the FX swap market has 
reportedly improved.  Nonetheless, spreads in  the FX swap market remained well above 
their pre-crisis levels, and market participan ts welcomed the Federal Reserve’s June 25 
announcement that it would extend its swap lines with other central banks through 
February 2010.  The ECB, BOE, and Swi ss National Bank (SNB) announced that they 
would continue to conduct 7- and 84-day auctions of dollar f unding until at least 
September 30, but they discontinued their 28-day auctions, citing low demand.  The 
SNB, ECB, Polish central bank, and Hungarian central bank also separately agreed to 
continue their own one-week swap operations supporting the exchange of euro and Swiss 
francs until at least th e end of October.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Recent indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies suggest that 
the pace of contraction has moderated furthe r.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) 
continued to rebound, although they do not yet point to expansion for all countries.  
Industrial production, while remaining well belo w pre-crisis levels, jumped in Japan, 
edged up in the euro area, and stabilized  further elsewhere.  Economic sentiment 
indicators also improved.  However, labor mark et conditions continued to deteriorate, and 
credit standards remain generally tight.   
Twelve-month consumer price inflation mode rated further, with all major advanced 
foreign economies except the United Kingdom expe riencing negative h eadline inflation.  
Excluding all food and energy prices, consum er price inflation has remained roughly 
stable.  Over the intermeeting period, the E CB began to implement its plan to purchase 
€60 billion of covered bonds over the next 12 months, and the BOE expanded its asset 
purchase program from £125 billion to £175 billion.

 In Japan , indicators for the second quarter are positive on balance.  Real exports surged a 
record 60 percent at an a nnual rate in the second quart er, but their level remains 
depressed, at 30 percent below their 2008 pea k.  After a 22 percent plunge in the first 
quarter, industrial production ro se 8.3 percent in the second quarter but remains at a low 
level.  These developments, combined with much-better-than-expected growth in real 
consumption, point to a return to positiv e growth in the second quarter.   
In contrast, performance in the housing and labor sectors has continued to be poor.  
Except for the temporary, regulation-induced de cline in 2007, housing starts are at their 
lowest level since records began in 1965.  Starts fell about 16 percent over the second 
quarter  and are down more than 30 percent in  the past 12 months.  House price 
appreciation in the major cities, which had turned positive in 2007, moved back down, 
falling almost 10 percent through the firs t quarter from a year earlier.   
The deterioration in the labor market continue s.  The job openings-to- applicants ratio (the 
number of officially posted job openings rela tive to the number of o fficially registered 
job seekers) reached a record low level of  0.43 in June.  Employment fell 2.1 percent 
over the past 12 months, the largest fall si nce 1955.  The unemployment rate rose to 
5.4 percent in June.  Furthermore, the 12-mont h change of real wages reached a record-
IV-24 
  
 low of negative 5.3 percent in June; in manufacturing, real wages fell more than 
12 percent.  
Japanese consumer prices fell 1.8 percent ov er the 12 months ending in June.  Prices 
excluding food and energy fell 0.7 percent over the same period.   The BOJ left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting 
period and extended its program of purcha ses of commercial paper, corporate bonds, 
equities, and government bonds until the end of  this year.  On July 21, Prime Minister 
Taro Aso dissolved the lower house of Par liament; general elections will be held on 
August 30.

 In the euro area , recent indicators suggest that the pace of contraction moderated in the 
second quarter.  Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in May after declining 7.4 percent 
in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in Apr il; in particular, Germany’s industrial production 
jumped 3.7 percent in May.  Retail sales gr ew 0.2 percent in Apr il, the first positive 
reading in seven months, but fell 0.5 percen t in May and 0.2 percent in June.  The 
business climate index, as well as consum er and industrial co nfidence, has rebounded 
somewhat in each month since April.  PMIs generally posted gains from April to July, 
although they are still in the contraction region.  The Ifo index of German business 
sentiment edged up further in July, continui ng a recovery from its historical low in 
March. 
However, labor market conditions continued to worsen.  The euro-area unemployment 
rate rose to 9.4 percent in May, up from a low of 7.2 percent in early 2008.  The extent of 
deterioration has varied considerably am ong euro-area countries,  with the Spanish 
unemployment rate up more than 10 percentage  points from its most recent low, while 
Germany’s unemployment rate ha s risen only ½ percentage poi nt.  The relatively small 
IV-27 
 
 
 
   response of the German unemplo yment rate partly reflects go vernment subsidies to firms 
to retain employees. 
The net percentage of euro-a rea banks reporting a tightening of credit standards applied 
to firms declined to 21 percent in the second quarter, down from 43 percent in the first.  
The net tightening continued to mainly refl ect expectations rega rding general economic 
activity and the industry or fi rm-specific outlook.  The net percentage of banks reporting 
a tightening of credit standards for loan s to households for house purchase and for 
consumer credit also decreas ed in the second quarter.  
According to the flash estimate, twelve-mont h euro-area July inflation was negative 
0.6 percent.  In June, headline inflation wa s negative 0.1 percent.  The downturn in 
energy prices has been an important factor in the decline of inflation:  Twelve-month 
energy price inflation in June was negative 11.9 percent, off from the peak of 17 percent in mid-2008.  Excluding energy and food, June inflation edged down to 1.4 percent.   
The Governing Council of the ECB kept it s benchmark policy rate unchanged at 
1 percent at its August 6 meeting.  Following the ECB’s record liqui dity injection of €442 
billion in one-year funds, th e overnight EONIA rate has d eclined to about 0.35 percent 
since end-June, just above th e 0.25 percent rate on the ECB’s deposit facility.  The ECB 
has begun to implement plans to buy €60 b illion worth of covered bonds, and by early 
August had purchased about €5 billion in such bonds.

 In the United Kingdom , real GDP contracted 3.1 percent at an annual rate in the second 
quarter, according to the preliminary estimat e, bringing the cumulative drop in activity 
since early 2008 to almost 6 percent.  The out put of services industr ies fell 2.6 percent, 
with the largest declines observed in the tran sportation sector.  The volume of activity in 
production and construction industries c ontracted 0.6 percent and 8.4 percent, 
respectively. 
Indicators received since the la st Greenbook are broadly consiste nt with a stabilization of 
economic activity in recent months, but signs of a general economic recovery remain 
limited.  The PMIs for manufacturing and services stood at 50.8 and 53.2 in July, and 
indicators of consumer and business conf idence improved further.  The Labor Force 
Survey measure of the unemployment rate jumped to 7.6 percent in April, and the claims-based measure ticked up to 4.8 percent in J une.  Both the Halifax and Nationwide house 
price indexes have edged up in recent months , after having fallen about 20 percent from 
their peaks. 
The supply of credit to the nonfinancial sector  continues to be tight, and the demand for 
credit very weak.  Net lending to private nonfin ancial corporations again turned negative 
in the second quarter, while net lending secured by dwellings reached a historical low.  
According to the BOE’s Credit Conditions Surv ey, lenders reported an increase in default 
rates and losses given default on both corpor ate and household loans in the three months 
IV-30 
 
 
 to mid-June.  However, respondents on net expected an increase in the availability of 
credit to households and corporati ons over the following three months. 
The 12-month rate of headline inflation mode rated to 1.8 percent in June, falling below 
the BOE’s 2 percent target for the first time since September 2007.  Producers’ input 
prices fell 11.0 percent in June from a year ea rlier.  Wage inflation has slowed noticeably 
in recent months.  Average earnings including bonuses rose 2½ percent in the year to 
May, 1½ percentage points less th an its average growth rate over the previous five years. 
On August 6, the Monetary Policy Committee of the BOE expanded its asset purchase 
program from £125 billion to £175 billion and wide ned the range of gilts  it was willing to 
acquire.  The Committee allowed itself three months to complete the additional 
purchases.

 In Canada , indicators received so far for the s econd quarter have been mixed.  Monthly 
GDP fell 5.9 percent at an annual rate in May, following a 2.5 perc ent contraction in 
April.  Housing starts declined a further 8½ percent in the second quarter.  Employment 
also fell over the second quarter, albeit at a slow er pace than in the first quarter.  On the 
positive side, retail sales rose ¾ percent a nd building permits increased in May.  In 
addition, business credit rose ½ percent in Ju ne, and the balance of opinion for future 
sales from the Bank of Canada’s busine ss outlook survey hit a near-record high. 
Twelve-month headline inflation in June d eclined to negative 0.3 percent, down sharply 
from its 3.5 percent peak in August 2008.  Inflation excluding food and energy remained 
at around 1 percent.  Median hourly earnings were down ½ pe rcent in the second quarter. 
The BOC kept its overnight target rate uncha nged, at 0.25 percent, at its policy meeting 
in late July.  In the statement following the meeting, the BOC reite rated its intention, 
conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep it s target rate at this  level until the end of 
the second quarter of 2010.  The BOC also revised up its projections for growth 
somewhat, citing a more modest retrench ment of household and business spending, 
improved financial conditions, and better terms of trade than ha d been projected in April.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Recent data show that economic activity su rged across emerging Asia in the second 
quarter.  Real GDP rebounded sharply in Chin a and South Korea, and the preliminary 
estimate in Singapore indicates substantial growth.  In Ch ina, policy stimulus lifted 
activity, which in turn contri buted to boosting exports of other countries in Asia.  
Indicators for these other countries also poi nt to a strong rebound in the second quarter.  
In Latin America, activity remained depresse d in Mexico, partly reflecting the adverse 
effect of the swine flu outbreak.  In contrast, activity in Brazil appear s to have recovered.  
Twelve-month consumer price inflation further moderated across the emerging market 
economies, with several countries in Asia re gistering deflations.  After cutting policy 
rates aggressively earlier, many central banks kept their policy rates on hold while others 
in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippi nes, and Russia continued to lower them. 
The staff estimates that in China  real GDP rose 18½ percent at an annual rate in the 
second quarter.  The jump in growth partly reflects strong fixed-asset investment, which 
was 36 percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier.  Investment was 
supported by the fiscal stimulus package and a massive surge in bank lending.  Industrial 
production also grew at a solid  pace in the second quarter.   In a promising signal of 
external demand, the export order subindex of  the manufacturing PMI, which crossed 
into expansionary range in May, rose further in June and July.  The trade surplus in the 
second quarter narrowed to $145 billion, as e xports flattened and imports rose sharply, 
driven in part by the increase in commod ity prices and strong er domestic demand. 
Benchmark interest rates and banks’ reserve requirements ha ve been on hold since the 
end of last year, but Chinese authorities have  been encouraging loan growth this year 
after limiting credit growth the past few year s.  Consequently, outstanding loans in June 
were 34 percent higher than a year earlier.  Chinese authorities expressed concerns that 
the lending may prompt asset bubbles and nonperforming loans, but they were not likely 
to significantly curtail lending in the near term.  Thus far, the loan growth has not 
triggered inflationary pressures.  Chinese c onsumer prices in June  were 1¾ percent below 
their year-earlier level, and prices were flat  in the second quarter re lative to the first.

India’s indicators suggest robust growth in the second quarter.  Industrial production 
grew in April and May.  The headline PMI av eraged 55, up from about 47 in the previous 
two quarters, suggesting an expansion in econom ic activity.  Exports rose in the second 
quarter, ending three consecutive quarters of declines, but even higher imports kept the 
trade balance in deficit.  Twelve-month c onsumer price inflation fell in May and rose 
back up in June due to higher food prices, bu t the closely watched wholesale price index 
fell sharply in June, primarily reflecting d eclines in energy prices.  The government 
released its 2009-10 fiscal year  budget, which targets a deficit of 6¾ percent of GDP.  
Citing lack of sufficient de tail regarding medium-term consolidation of government 
finances, markets reacted poorly, with th e local market index falling, the rupee 
depreciating, and sovere ign bond spreads widening.

    n.a. Not available.  ... Not applicable.   Source: CEIC; Reuters.Economic activity in the newly industrialized economies ( NIEs)1 rebounded sharply in 
the second quarter as exports, particularly to China, genera lly picked up and as domestic 
demand strengthened in some cases.  In Sout h Korea, real GDP grew at a 9¾ percent 
pace, supported by strong domestic demand resu lting mainly from the effects of previous 
policy easing, and by exports.  In Singapore, the advanced estimate (unofficial) suggests 
that activity also rebounded sh arply, ending four consecutive  quarters of negative growth, 
on account of strong activity in the biomedi cal and electronic sect ors.  In Taiwan, 
industrial production rose steeply  in the second quarter, and exports shot up, partly owing 
to the upturn in the high-tech sector.  In  addition, a recent surge in imports of capital 
goods and consumer products suggests that domestic demand has likely firmed.  Hong 
Kong’s indicators, including improvements in  consumer sentiment and increases in 
property prices, also point to recovery  of activity in the second quarter. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation con tinued to fall across the region, reflecting 
slack in economic activity and, in some cases, declines in domestic energy prices and 
transport costs.  Amid the lower inflation and still-fragile economic environment, central 
banks have kept policy rate s on hold at low levels.

experienced the sharpest decline over the prev ious two quarters.  Exports from the region 
have picked up, aided by demand from Chin a, and industrial production has generally 
moved up in the second quarter.  Twelve-mont h consumer price inflation continued to 
fall across the region, with Thailand and Malaysia  registering deflation in recent months.  
The central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines further eased monetary policy, 
lowering rates 25 basis points in July.

pace than in the first.  Industrial producti on fell sharply in May due to a two-week 
shutdown of manufacturing plants  in response to the swine flu outbreak.  The automotive 
sector showed signs of improvements with  auto exports increa sing and inventories 
falling, but production was held back by the restructuring of Chrysler and General 
Motors.  Both exports and imports rose in June, but they remained relatively weak 
overall.  The unemployment rate rose to 5¾ percent in the second quarter. 
Twelve-month headline consumer price inflation is abating, reflecting tepid domestic 
demand and the stabilization of  the peso, but remained stubo rnly above the upper limit of 
the Bank of Mexico’s 2-to-4 percent target ra nge.  Nevertheless, th e Bank of Mexico cut 
its policy rate 75 basis points to 4½ per cent during the intermeeting period.  In the 
legislative elections held on July 5, the ruli ng PAN party lost the majority of the lower 
house of Congress to the opposition PRI party.  The results cast some uncertainty over 
the Calderon administration’s ability to  achieve its economic reform agenda. 
In Brazil, data releases suggest that activity likely recovered in the second quarter, 
supported in part by the fiscal stimulus.  Br azil also benefited from strong Asian growth, 
which lifted exports of prim ary commodities.  Retail sales edged up over the April-May 
period and appear to have been strong in  June, boosted by tax holidays for autos and

Industrial production 
rebounded in the second quarter, but remained we ll below its peak of la st fall.  Anecdotal 
reports suggest that inventor ies have been winding down. 
Inflationary pressures continued to abate, with 12-month consumer price inflation falling 
below 5 percent in June for the first time si nce 2007.  At its mid-July meeting, the central 
bank of Brazil cut its target for the policy rate 50 basis points to a record low of 
8¾ percent.  The accompanying statement wa s widely interpreted as signaling no 
additional cuts this year.  The government’s  development bank, the only domestic source 
of long-term lending, also reduced its loan  rates.  Net capital inflows continued, 
prompting the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate 
upward pressures on the real.

 In Russia, first-quarter real GDP contracted at  an unprecedented 30 percent annual rate.  
The decline was broad based, with sizable  contractions in private consumption, 
investment, and exports.  Indicators suggest that real GDP wa s flat in the second quarter.  
Although industrial production cont racted and retail sales remained weak, activity in the 
construction and agriculture sectors was str ong.  Also, exports in April and May rose 
following several months of declines.  Tw elve-month consumer price inflation has 
moderated over the past few months, with th e June reading falling below 12 percent for 
the first time since January of last year.  Amid the declines in inflation and weak 
economic activity, the central bank cut its poli cy rate 50 basis point s in early July to 
11 percent, bringing the cumula tive rate reduction for the past four months to 200 basis 
points.  The central bank has been intervening in the foreign exchange market to stem 
ruble appreciation, resulting in a renewed accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, 
which have risen $30 billion since March to about $410 billion by the end of June. 
In emerging Europe , economic activity continued to fall in the three Baltic economies of 
Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia in the s econd quarter following substantial double-digit 
real GDP contractions in the first.  Lithuania's real GDP plunged at an annual rate of 
34 percent in the second quarter, and the availa ble indicators for Estonia and Latvia also 
point to further contractions.  In late July  the IMF and Latvia ag reed on a set of policy 
actions that will put the country's IMF program back on track and free up a second 
tranche of IMF funding of about €200 million.  In exchange for the aid, Latvia will 
undertake additional budget tightening throughout  2012.  Lithuania indicated that it could 
seek IMF assistance to help finance its budge t deficit.  Elsewhere in emerging Europe, 
economic activity also remained depressed in  the second quarter, but  to a substantially 
lesser degree than in the first.
