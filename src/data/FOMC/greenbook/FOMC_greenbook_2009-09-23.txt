II-1 Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. The incoming data, on balance, suggest that economic activity is beginning to turn up.  
While employment continued to contract in  July and August, the pace of decline has 
slowed noticeably from earlie r in the year.  Factory output, especially motor vehicle 
production, moved up in July and August, and sales and construction of single-family 
homes have now risen for several months—thoug h, to be sure, these increases are from 
very low levels.  Consumer spending on moto r vehicles was boosted in July and August 
by the “cash for clunkers” program and incr eased dealer incentives, and household 
spending elsewhere appears to have increased in August after having been roughly flat in 
the May to July period.  Meanwhile, investment  in equipment and software also appears 
to be stabilizing after declining sharply in the first half of the year.  Core consumer price 
inflation remained subdued in July and August,  though a jump in gasoline prices pushed 
up overall consumer inflation last month. 
Labor Market Developments 
Although the labor market conti nues to deteriorate, the pa ce of job losses moderated 
further in July and August.  Private nonf arm
 payroll employment fell by 248,000 in July 
and 198,000 in August, the smallest monthly declines since last August.  Although 
employment losses have continued to be sp read across nearly every major industry, the 
rate of decline has also diminished in mo st industries over the pa st two months.  The 
decline in hours worked has also slowed:  The length of the average workweek for 
production and nonsupervisory workers has remain ed steady, albeit at a low level, and 
aggregate hours worked for this group fell 0.2 percent over July and August, the smallest 
two-month decline in the past year.   
In the household survey, the rise in the unempl oyment rate has slowed, on net, in recent 
months:  The unem
ployment rate increased  0.3 percentage point in August, to 
9.7 percent, after having dipped slightly in July.  The labor force participation rate moved down to 65.5 percent in July and remained unc hanged in August.  In addition, the fraction 
of workers who are working part time fo r economic reasons—a measure of the under-
utilization of labor—remains high but has not increased further since the spring.  
Other indicators of labor demand have b een mi
 xed recently.  Although the number of 
individuals receiving unemployment insuran ce through regular stat e programs has fallen 
a bit from its peak, the total number of i ndividuals receiving une mployment insurance—

1 The decline in the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance through regular state 
programs is likely due, in part, to an increase in the fraction of unemployed workers exhausting their 
benefits under these programs.

 which includes extended and emergency benefits—has not yet started to decline.1  In 
addition, initial claims for unemployment insuran ce have fallen from th eir peak earlier in 
the year, but they have moved sideways since July and are currently at a level consistent 
with further declines in employment.  The la yoff rate as measured from the Job Openings 
and Labor Turnover Survey has also fallen, on net, since the turn of the year, but it 
moved back up in July—its most recent reading—and is now just a notch below its first-
quarter level.  Forward-looking indicators of  hiring—such as the indexes of hiring plans 
from the Manpower and NFIB surveys—rema in weak.  In contrast, some survey 
measures of job openings and of labor market  slack have improved slightly in recent 
months, and household expectations of labor  market conditions over the next 6 to 12 
months showed noticeable further imp rovement in August and September. 
With hours having declined much more rapidl y than output in the second quarter, the 
staff estimates that productivity  in the nonfarm
 busine ss sector rose at an annual rate of 
6½ percent last quarter.  However, this gain followed three quarters of weak productivity 
performance, and over the four quarters e nding in the second quarter of this year, 
productivity is estimated to have increased 2 percent.

2 In addition, recent projections from consultancies,  such as Gartner and iSupply, foresee a relatively 
dour, albeit improved, outlook for the semiconductor industry.   Industrial Production  
Industrial production (IP) rose in both July and August, led by a bounceback in motor 
vehicle production from the extraordinarily lo w a
ssembly rates earlier this year.  Aside 
from a hurricane-related rebound in October 2008, these gains were the first monthly 
increases in overall IP since December 2007.  Manufacturing production moved up at an 
average rate of 1 percent in July and A ugust; excluding motor vehicles, factory output 
rose 0.5 percent, on average, in the past two months, likely refl ecting rising demand for 
materials from the motor vehicle sector and a slowing pace of inventory liquidation 
elsewhere.  Despite the recen t production gains and favorable indicators of orders, an 
enormous amount of slack remains in the manufacturing sector; the factory operating 
rate, at 66.6 percent in August,  is only modestly above its  recent historical low. 
In the transportation se ctor, the production of motor vehi cles and parts jumped 27 percent 
from
 June to August.  Meanwhile, the output of  aircraft and parts has continued to move 
roughly sideways.  Despite the continuing delays in Boeing’s 787 program—currently, 
the first test flight is expected at the end of this year, and the first delivery is expected in 
late 2010—overall commercial aircraft produc tion probably will remain close to present 
levels in coming months due to the co mpany’s large backlog of orders.   
The output of high-tech industries, which turned up in February, increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent be tween May and August.  Semiconductor output has revived 
modestly in the past six months , as a broad-based increase in
 the output of chips has been 
partly offset by declines in circuit board production.2  Industry anecdotes suggest that 
these recent gains, in part, reflect invent ory restocking after the exceptionally deep 
production cuts late last year.  For computers,  production declines moderated in both July 
and August.  Although unit shipments of persona l computers moved slightly higher, real 
output nevertheless decreased as production shifted toward lower-valued machines; in 
addition, second-quarter shipments of servers fell precipitously.  The output of communications equipment edged up, on net, in  July and August after jumping in June. 
Forward-looking indicators of high-tech pr oduction point to some im
 provement in the 
near term.  Intel and Texas Instruments announc ed anticipated revenue  gains in the third 
quarter, citing strong demand for some of their chips.  For computers, major

3 Indeed, Cisco recently reported a rise in orders consistent with normal seasonality for the current 
quarter, a marked improvement co mpared with recent quarters. of 2009 and to begin to increase in 2010.  Fi nally, major U.S. tele communications service 
providers recently reiterated  that they expect to m eet their annual 2009 capital 
expenditure guidance, suggesting that this market segment will buttress communications 
equipment production over th e remainder of the year.3  Recent trade data showing 
sharply rising high-tech expor ts suggest that the forei gn sector, which absorbs the 
majority of U.S. high-tech IP, will al so support production in the near term.  
The production of energy stepped up in A ugust.  A swing to warmer-than-average 
temp
eratures in August from a relatively cool Ju ly contributed to a la rge gain in utilities 
output last month following a weather-related  decline a month earlier.  In addition, 
drilling activity appears to have flattened out recently after plunging by more than half 
since late last year. 
Outside of energy, transportation, and high-t echnology industries, production rose at an 
average rate of about 0.5 pe rcent in July and August.  Production of consumer goods 
increased 1.0 percent in August after edgi ng down in July.  The output of business 
equipm
ent rose modestly in both July and Augus t after averaging declin es in the first half 
of the year of about 2 percent per month.   The output of construction supplies increased at  an average rate of about 0.3 percent in 
July and August, though output remains m
ore than 25 percent below its peak in January 
2006.  Elsewhere, the production of materials av eraged gains of ¾ percent in July and 
August; demand for steel and other material s was likely boosted by the bounceback in 
motor vehicle assemblies.   The available indicators of near-term manufact uring activity have continued to brighten 
and point to further gains in  factory output.  The three-month moving average of the 
staff’s series on real adjusted  durable goods orders rose in July for the third straight 
month.  The diffusion index of new orders from the nationa l m
anufacturing ISM survey 
jumped 9½ index points to 65 in August.  Th e new orders diffusion indexes from the 
regional manufacturing surveys also have m oved up but by less than the ISM index.  In 
the Empire State survey, the first reading on manufacturing activity in September, new 
orders rose further and were consistent with  solid near-term increases in manufacturing 
output.

4 The official name is the Consum er Assistance to Recycle and Sa ve (CARS) Act.  Under the act, 
eligible trade-ins were required to be in drivable c ondition, to have been continuously insured by the same 
owner for at least a year prior to trade-in, to have been manufactured in model year 1984 or later, and to 
have a combined (city and highway) fuel economy rating of 18 miles per gallon (mpg) or less.  Trade-ins were to be replaced by a new vehicle priced at $45,00 0 or less.  The new auto had to get at least 22 mpg 
and be at least 4 mpg more fuel efficient than the old vehicle to qualify for a $3,500 voucher; if the new car 
got at least 10 mpg more than the old vehicle, the voucher was worth $4,500.  New light trucks were 
required to get at least 18 mpg and be at least 2 mpg mo re fuel efficient than the old vehicle to qualify for a 
$3,500 voucher; if the new vehicle got at least 5 mpg more than the old, the voucher was worth $4,500.  
Dealers had to first provide documentation that the trade-ins had been scrapped before receiving payment 
from the government. 
5 While cash for clunkers was in effect, many dealer s increased their own cash rebates.  However, PIN 
permitted the dealers in its sample to report a cash- for-clunkers voucher as e ither a cash rebate or a 
reduction in the vehicle price.  As a result, we cannot separate the impact  of the program on either of these 
series.  Nonetheless, since the program ended, average cash rebates have fallen sharply, and average 
vehicle prices have surged.  
6 We believe that the cash-for-clunkers program will have only a small impact on light vehicle 
production over the long run.  Manufacturers had announced a large increase in third-quarter motor vehicle 
production prior to the announcement of the program, and schedules have actually moved down a little 
since then.  Motor Vehicles  
Purchases of light motor vehicles rose again in August, surging almo st 3 million units to 
an annual rate of 14.1 million units.  While sa les were up for the Detroit Three, imports 
and vehicles produced by the major transplant s accounted for about three-fourths of the 
August increase.  As a result, the market sh are of domestically produced vehicles fell 
further, weighed down by a sharp drop in the share of the Detroit Three.   
The increase in vehicle sales last month was largely due to the government’s cash-for-
clunkers program
, which officially began on July 27 and ended on August 24.4  About 
690,000 (not at an annual rate) vehicles were  sold under the program.  Past experience 
with earlier large-scale auto mobile incentive programs suggests that most of these 
purchases were likely pulled ahead from future sales, and indeed, weekly PIN data from 
J.D. Power and Associates suggest that both light vehicle sales and consumer incentives 
plummeted in the weeks after the program expired.5  The end of the cash-for-clunkers 
program also likely contributed to the early  September drop in the index of car-buying 
attitudes from the Reuters/Univ ersity of Michigan Surveys of  Consumers; this index fell 
back to its level at the beginning of the year. 
Production of light motor vehicles increased ¾ million units in August to an annual rate 
of 6.4 million units after having ju m
ped 1.7 million units in July.6  However, the higher

7 The PCE control category includes durables excluding motor vehicles, nondurables excluding 
gasoline, and food services. 
8 In the latest GDP release, the BEA revised down  its estimate of compensation in the first quarter 
further on the basis of the UI tax records.   production rates in recent months were insuffi cient to keep pace with  the surge in sales 
spurred by cash for clunkers, and stocks of domestic vehicles plunged in August to their 
lowest level in the history of this series, which begins in 1983.  Industry schedules call 
for assemblies to move up again in September and to rise to an annual rate of 6.8 million 
units in the fourth quarter.  Assuming so me post-cash-for-clunkers  dropback in sales, 
days’ supply should return to more co mfortable levels next quarter.  
Consumer Spending   
As noted, overall consumer spending was boos ted temporarily in July and August by the 
cash-for-clunkers program.  On th e basis of the latest retail sales release, w
e estimate that 
real spending on most other goods and food services (PCE control) jumped 0.9 percent in 
August after little change in July.  This is th e first sizable increase in several months for 
this category, which had drifted down, on average, in the first half of the year after having contracted sharply in th e second half of last year.
7  Real spending on services 
moved up again in July—the la test available data—but only slightly.  The saving rate 
edged down to 4¼ percent in July, 3 percentage points higher than it s pre-recession level.  
Despite some positive incoming news, the environment for household spending remains challenging.  Real disposable income increased moderately over the first half of the year, as the lower taxes and in
creased transfers in cluded in the stimulus package outweighed a 
sizable contraction in labor compensation.8  However, most of the direct effect for 
households of the stimulus bill was already refl ected in the level of disposable income by 
the end of the second quarter.   And although the w ealth-to-income ratio ticked up in the 
second quarter—its first increase since th e second quarter of 2007—and likely rose 
further this quarter, households have lost wealth equivalent to about 1¾ years of income 
over the past two years and are likely stil l making the attendant adjustments to their 
spending.  On a more positive note, compensation in July posted its first nominal gain this year, and the various measures of hous ehold sentiment—though still at low levels—
have improved some in recent months.   
Housing  
A gradual recovery in housing activity appear s to be under way.  In  July, single-family 
housing starts registered their fifth consecutive increase, a nd the level of starts stood

almost 40 percent above the record low reach ed in the first quarter of this year. 9  
Adjusted permit issuance—which often is a more reliable indicator of the underlying 
pace of new construction activity—has also moved up in recent months, though its level was a touch below the rate of starts in July.  In contrast, in the much smaller multifamily 
sector—where credit conditions have remain ed especially tight and vacancies have 
remained high—starts have continued to declin e, on net, this year after having plunged in 
the second half of 2008. 
The latest sales data suggest that the demand for new single-family homes has also 
strengthened after having stabilized in the ea rly part of this year.  The Census Bureau’s 
measure of the number of new-home sales ag reements jumped to an annual rate of 
433,000 units in July, 32 percent above the record low in January.
10   
 
 
 
.  Alt hough sales levels are still quite  modest, they have been 
enough, given the very slow pace of production, to pare the o
verhang of unsold single-
family houses:  By July, these inventories had fallen to about one-hal f of their peak level 
in the summer of 2006, and the months’ supply of new homes was down considerably from its record high in January.
11 
Sales of existing sing le-family houses, which had been fa irly flat early in the year, 
advanced 6.5 percent in Ju ly to their highest level since mid-2007, and pending home 
sales agreements through July suggest that resale activity will climb fu rther in the months 
ahead.12  To be sure, sales in the existing-home market have been supported for much of 
the year by the elevated number of transactions involving bank-owned and other distressed properties.  However, the recent rise  in resale activity appears to have been 
driven by a rise in transac tions of nondistressed propertie s:  Data from the National 
Association of Realtors sugge st that distressed sales dropped to one-third of all sales 
transactions for existing homes in the May to  July period after re portedly accounting for 
about 40 to 45 percent of sales between December and April.   
                                                
9 The series for single-family housing starts begins in 1959.  
10 The series for new home sales begins in 1963. 
11 The series for months’ supply begins in 1963. 
12 However, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the high proportion of distressed 
sales and the unusually tight credit conditions in the housing market have made pending home sales a less-
informative leading indicator of existing home sales than  usual.  Increases in the shares of cash purchases 
and of distressed sales have made the timing between contract and closing for existing homes more uncertain.

13 In addition, the first-time homebuyer tax credit may be providing some support to home sales at 
present.  However, the proportion of  first-time home purchasers has remained about flat over recent months 
at around 30 percent—considerably lower than the average prop ortion seen over the past decade of 
40 percent (according to the NAR)—suggesting that other factors have been more important. The apparent modest revival of housing dema nd seen in recent months is likely due, in 
part, to improvements in housing affordability  stemming from low rates for conforming 
mortgages and from both the lower level and th e slower rate of d ecline of house prices.13  
Mortgage interest rates for conforming thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages—at about 
5 percent—remain very low by historical standards.  In addition, although spreads 
between rates for jumbo and st andard conforming loans remain elevated relative to pre-
crisis norms, they have continued to narrow in recent months despite the fact that the 
secondary market for private-label nonconf orming mortgages remains closed.  As for 
house prices, the repeat-sales price index for existing singl e-family homes calculated by 
LoanPerformance jumped 12 percent at an annual rate in the s econd quarter; over the 
12 months ending in July, the index fell 12 per cent, a noticeably slow er rate of decline 
than earlier in the year.  Moreover, the Re uters/Michigan survey’s diffusion index for 
year-ahead house price expectations moved up further in September’s  preliminary read:  
A greater number of respondents now expect  house prices to increase over the next 
12 months than expect prices to fall. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) appears to be stabilizing after having 
dropped steeply for more than a year.  A lthough this leveling out is particularly 
noticeable in the transp
ortation equipment sect or, some signs of stabilization are evident 
for both high-tech and other types of equipment.  Orders for nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft have recovered consider ably in recent months and, in July, stood 
3½ percent above their second-qua rter average.  Meanwhile, shipments increased in June 
and July at an average monthly rate of about 1 percent. 
Business purchases of transportation equipment appear to be expanding at a solid clip in 
the third quarter.  Business outlays for light ve hicles in July and August rose from their 
lackluster second-quarter pace.  Most of th e gain cam
e from rental car companies.  
Demand for medium and heavy trucks edged hi gher, on average, in July and August from 
the extremely low levels that prevailed in the second quarter.  As  freight shipping has 
picked up, the pace of new truck orders has begun to move higher, which suggests some 
additional improvement in medium and heavy truc k sales over the next couple of months.

Although aircraft shipments in July were belo w their second-quarter average, the value of 
Boeing’s airplane deliveries stepped up in August. 
After declining steeply for several quarters , real spending on high-tech E& S appears to 
have turned up.  In the second quarter, spe nding on computers and peripherals and on 
communications equipment increased, and, as indicated by the recent data from the 
Quarterly Services Survey, purchases of software weakened less than the BEA had assumed in its earlier estimates of sec ond-quarter real GDP.  Early this quarter, 
investment in high-tech equipment appears to have continued to advance, with the levels 
of both nominal orders and shipments in July nearly 8 percent above their averages in the 
second quarter.  In addition, a few major produce rs of high-tech equipment have recently 
reported that they are seeing some signs of improvement in demand. 
Business investment in equipment other th an transporta
 tion a nd high-tech, a broad 
category of goods that accounts for one-half of total E&S outlays, is also showing 
tenuous hints of stabilization.  Orders have recovered markedly in recent months, while 
shipments edged up, on balance, over June and July. The fundamental determinants of investment in E&S remain weak, but co
 nditions appear 
to have become less adverse in recent months .  The decline in business output was less 
pronounced last quarter than in the preceding th ree quarters, and the four-quarter change 
in the user cost of capital fell back somewh at in the second quarter after having spiked 
last year.  Monthly surveys of business conditions and sentiment have  recently recovered 
to levels suggesting a modest rise in busi ness spending.  Although spreads of corporate 
bonds over Treasury securities are still some what elevated, they have come down 
considerably from their extremely high levels at the end of last y ear, likely reflecting a 
decrease in uncertainty and assessments of be tter underlying profitabi lity.  In addition, 
the net share of small businesses reporting in creased difficulty in obtaining credit moved 
down a bit in the August NFIB survey, a nd the July SLOOS reported that the net 
percentage of banks that ti ghtened standards on commercial and industrial loans receded 
further.  Nevertheless, the levels of these indicators suggest that  credit is still tight. 
Nonresidential Construction   
Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally rema in dismal.  Although 
outlays on energy-related projec ts surged in the second quart er, data through July suggest 
that broader m
easures of construction spe nding remain on a steep downward trajectory.  
The weakness was widespread across categories and likely reflected the drag from a large 
number of negative fundamentals:  Available da ta show that vacancy rates are rising and

14 In all, real nonfarm inventories are estimated to ha ve fallen at an annual rate of $169 billion in the 
second quarter, with about one-fourth of this liquidation occurring in the motor vehicles sector. that property prices are genera lly plunging across the sector.  In  addition, the architectural 
billings index in July remained at a level consistent with further spending declines, and 
the nonresidential constr uction industry has continued to shed workers.  Finally, as 
indicated by the July SLOOS, the financing environment for nonresid ential construction 
projects remains very tight, a nd available Call Report data show that banks pared back 
nonresidential constructi on lending in both the firs t and second quarters.  
Real spending on drilling and mining structures dropped at an annual rate of 70 percent in 
the second quarter after an even  larger decline in the first quarter; available indicators 
suggest that activ
ity more recently has only edged up from a low level.  The steep decline 
in energy prices in the second half of la st year greatly diminished incentives for 
additional drilling activity.  Th is downward pressure has been  particularly pronounced in 
the natural gas sector—which accounts for most of the rigs in operation—as spot prices have remained near a seven-year low because  of weak demand and a glut of new supply 
from recently developed fields.  By contrast , this year’s partia l rebound in oil prices 
seems to have led to a modest increas e in drilling activity in that sector. 
Business Inventories   
The sharp cuts in production this year have reduced inventory stocks si
 gnificantly.  Real 
nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles fell at an annual rate of about $120 billion in the second quarter, more than twice the pace of liquidation recorded in the first quarter, 
and the book-value data for the manufacturi ng and trade sector in  July suggest that 
businesses continued to cut back invent ory stocks early in the third quarter.
14  Although 
the months’ supply measure implied by the book- value data has come down significantly 
in the past few months, it remains elevated when measured at the current soft pace of 
sales.  The picture from the staff’s flow-of- goods inventory system is broadly the same:  
While the level of inventories continued to drop back  in July and August, the decline in 
months’ supply, aside from motor vehicles , has been modest given weak demand.  
Months’ supply remains elevated for all the major market groups excluding motor 
vehicles.  By contrast, according to the IS M, the net fraction of  manufacturing supply 
managers that perceive their customers’ i nventories as too high moved down further in 
August to a level not seen since 2004, s uggesting that purchasing managers in

15 The question posed to purchasing managers in the ISM survey to determine whether stocks are too 
high or too low does not specify the measure of sales against which respondents should compare the level 
of their customers’ inventories.  If the respondents currently are judging inventories against a level of expected sales in coming months that is materially above the recent pace of sales (not an unreasonable 
assumption given the marked improvement in recent months of their new or ders index), the sharp decline in 
the customers’ inventories measure to a low level is le ss obviously at odds with the inventory ratios in both 
the book-value data and the staff’s flow-of-goods system. 
16 The financial stabilization programs added about $250 billion to the deficit in the 12 months ending 
in August. manufacturing, at least, believe  that some restocking by thei r customers may be in train.15  
Federal Government Sector  
The deficit in the federal unified budget wide ned further in July and August.  The budget 
costs associated with financ ial stabilization programs and the 2009 stimulus package, 
together with the effects
 of the recession on revenues and outlays, have continued to add 
to the budget gap.  The deficit for the 12 months ending in August totaled about 
$1.3 trillion, almost $1 trillion larger than in the preceding 12 months. 16    
Federal outlays, excluding such financial transactions as thos e related to the TARP and to 
the conservatorship of the mortgage-related GSEs, were 12 percent higher in the July-
August period than a year earlier.  Outlays  were boosted by spending authorized under 
the fiscal stimulus plan and for incom
e-support programs that have expanded during the 
recession.  The rise in outlays for defense in  the July-August period points to a modest 
increase during the third quart er in the NIPA measure of real federal expenditures 
following a sizable gain in the second quarter.     
Receipts fell 6½ percent in the July-August period relative to a year earlier, reflecting the 
ongoing weakness in economi
c activity.  Individua l income and payroll tax receipts have 
decreased as wages and salaries have declin ed, and as capital gain s realizations have 
likely fallen off.  Corporate tax payments ha ve plummeted, as profits were much lower 
than a year earlier.   
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its updated Budget and Economic Outlook , 
estimates that the federal budget deficit will be  almost $1.6 trillion in fiscal 2009 and that 
it will edge down to around $1.4 trillion in
 fiscal 2010.  Similarly, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), in its recent Mid-Session Review , expects the deficit to 
be about $1.6 trillion in fiscal 2009 and $1.5 trillion in fiscal 2010.  Although the CBO 
and OMB estimates for the deficit in this fisc al year are essentially the same, they are 
based on different budget accounting assumptions  for the mortgage-related GSEs:  The

17 With these adjustments, the OMB’s projection for the deficit this year is wider than the adjusted 
CBO estimate because the OMB assumes higher outlays th is year for the TARP and for other programs.  
However, the OMB’s estimates of cu rrent-year outlays have often been too high at the time of the Mid-
Session Review .   
18 Work on state and local cons truction projects is largely performed by private contractors. 
19 As of the end of August, only about $2 billion in infrastructure grants had been disbursed, but states 
may have gone ahead with construction projects in antic ipation of receiving the stimulus funds at a later 
date.  
20 The estimates from the Rockefeller Institute are for internal use only.  The missing states are New 
Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Dakota. CBO treats Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as if they were entities of the federal 
government, while the OMB records onl y the ongoing budget costs of the GSE 
conservatorship.  Using the OMB’s budget accounting method for the GSEs, the CBO 
estimates that the deficit woul d be $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009.17 
State and Local Government Sector  
The recent data on purchases by state and local governments have exhibited striking crosscurrents, with substantia
l cutbacks in  employment balanced against considerable 
strength in construction spending.  According to the latest la bor market report, state and 
local employment fell 13,000 in August, and es timates for June and July were revised 
down to show a cumulative decline of 66,000; pa yrolls at both the st ate and local levels 
have fallen noticeably since May after having been little changed, on net, over the first 
five months of the year.  Meanwhile, real construction expenditures appear to have turned in another strong performance in July after ri sing at an annual rate of 25 percent in the 
second quarter.
18  The upswing in real construction spending follows a steep drop in the 
second half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 and is likely attribut able to a number of 
factors, including the availabil ity of federal stimulus funds, the easing of credit conditions 
in the municipal bond market, and reductions in construction costs.19 
The incom
ing information on the fiscal position of the sector remains grim.  The 
Rockefeller Institute of Government estim ates th
at, according to information from 
46 states, state tax revenues fell nearly 20 pe rcent on a year-over-yea r basis in the second 
quarter of 2009, with widespread weakness across the major categories of taxes.20  Like 
the states, local governments are struggling to close budget ga ps.  Indeed, nearly all cities 
that responded to the City Financial Conditi ons Survey conducted by the National League 
of Cities during the spring and early summer i ndicated that they were cutting spending in 
response to fiscal pressures (most commonly through attrition and la ying off workers or 
by canceling infrastructure projects).  In a ddition, 45 percent of th e responding cities had 
raised fees for public services, and 25 percent had hiked prop erty tax rates.

21 The definition of core PCE was changed in the r ecent comprehensive revision of the national income 
and product accounts to in clude restaurant meals. Prices  
Both headline and core PCE prices have dece lerated significantly over the past year, and 
recent mont
hly data suggest that the core measure has remained quite subdued while the 
headline measure has been boosted by a sharp upturn in energy prices.  Based on our 
translation  of the consumer price index (CPI) an d the producer price index (PPI), we 
estimate that, over the three months ending in  August, headline PCE prices rose at an 
annual rate of 3¾ percent after remaining a bout flat over the preceding three months.  
Meanwhile, we estimate that core PCE prices rose at an annual ra te of 1½ percent over 
the same period, compared with a 1¾ percent increase over the preceding three months.21  
Over the 12 months ending in August, headli ne PCE prices declined ½ percent after 
having risen 4½ percent over the year-earlier period; this sharp d eceleration reflects the 
reversal of last year’s surge in energy prices as well as a step-down in the increase in 
PCE prices excluding food and energy.  Core  PCE prices rose 1¼ percent over the 
12 months ending in August, compared with an increase of 2¾ per cent during the year-
earlier period, as market-based prices decel erated and non-market-based prices actually 
declined.  Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have also edged down 
since the last Greenbook, but remain within  their range of th e past few years. 
We estimate that consumer energy prices in creased 5 percent in August after a small 
decline in the previous month.  The pickup in August was led by a sizable increase in 
reta
il gasoline prices.  The latest available su rvey data show that gasoline prices edged up 
further in the first two weeks of September, but with crude oil prices down from their 
recent high in August of around $74 per barrel, we expect gasoline prices to drift down 
over the following couple of months.  
We estimate that PCE food prices turned up s lightly in August, bringing the decline over 
the three months ending in Augus t to nearly 1 percent.  This  decline, however, is m
uch 
smaller than the sharp decrease over the previ ous three months, a pattern consistent with 
our view that the pass-through from the sharp do wnturn in spot prices of farm products in 
the second half of last year is complete.  That said, farm prices have fallen again of late.  
The August USDA crop report projects a bumper harvest, which has pushed down corn 
and wheat spot prices since the last Greenbook, bringing the d ecline in these prices since 
the beginning of the year to about  10 and 30 percent, respectively. 
PCE prices excluding food and energy have be en rising more slowly in recent m onths 
than they did earlier in the year; we estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in

22 The staff estimates of PCE prices are slightly more  tentative than usual becau se of an adjustment the 
BEA has announced it is making to the BLS prices for cars and trucks in July and August.  A large number 
of cash-for-clunkers transactions o ccurred in the last week of July, but because the CPI measures new 
vehicle prices with some lag, a share of these transacti ons will be captured by the CPI in August rather than 
in July.  The BEA has stated that it is making timing adjustments in order to better align the PCE price index with the actual timing of the cash-for-clunkers transactions. August, the same as in July. 22  Although core nonmarket prices have turned back up 
recently after posting sizable declines early  this year, prices have decelerated 
considerably in many other categories.  In pa rticular, tax-related hi kes in tobacco prices 
are no longer pushing up inflati on as much as they did this spring, increases in prices of 
housing services have moderated noticeably, and a number of durable goods prices have 
declined outright.  
Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/Michigan survey slipped to 
2.6 percent in the preliminary September surv ey but are still noticeably higher than the 
roughly 2 percent level recorded  around the turn of the year .  Long-term
 expectations—at 
2.9 percent in the preliminary September survey—have edged down since the August 
Greenbook but remain in the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years.  In addition, median long-term expected PCE in flation from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters fell back to 2.2 percent in th e third quarter after edging up briefly to 
2.3 percent in the previous quarter.     
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate ma
 terials posted an increase 
in August for a third consecutive month; this  index has now retraced about one-third of 
the decline that occurred over the precedi ng eight months.  Following sharp increases 
over the first seven months of this year, changes in prices of non-energy commodities 
have been mixed since the August Greenbook.  In particular, the CRB index of spot 
prices of commodities has edged down ¾ percent, whereas the Journal of Commerce  
index has risen 2 percent.  
Labor Costs  
All of our measures of hourly compensati on and wages have decelerated sharply this 
year, likely in response to the sizable degr ee of slack in labor markets.  The ECI for 
private industry workers increased at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in the first half of 
the year, 1¾
 percentage points less than the rise in 2008.  The deceleration in the ECI was 
broadly similar for both the wages and benef its components of the index.  In addition, 
P&C compensation per hour (CPH) in the nonfar m business sector is now estimated to 
have tumbled at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the first quarter, possibly reflecting a 
II-42 
                                                 
23 The series for P&C hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector begins in 1947.   steep decline in bonus payments similar to what  we have seen in the ECI.  In the second 
quarter, CPH is reported to have ticked up, br inging the decline over th e first half of the 
year to an annual rate of 2¼ percent, which is by far the la rgest half-year drop in nominal 
compensation on record.23  As a result of the decline in hourly compensation and the 
large gain in productivity, the already-elevated mar kup of prices over unit labor costs in 
the nonfarm business sector rose furthe r in the first half of this year. 
Turning to the current quarter, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory 
workers rose 0.3 percent in both July and A ugust, with the latest  reading boosted by an 
increase in the federal minim
um wage that went  into effect at the end of July.  Over the 
12 months ending in August, this wage meas ure rose 2.6 percent, 1¼ percentage points 
less than over the preceding year.

 Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Over the intermeeting period, conditions in U.S. short-term funding markets improved a 
bit more, and loans outstanding at the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and credit facilities 
declined further.  Although economic data appe ared to be largely in  line with, or a little 
better than, market expectations, federal f unds and Eurodollar futures rates moved down 
on net.  Nominal Treasury yields also decrease d across the term structure, and auctions of 
very large volumes of newly issued Treasury securities were well re ceived by investors.  
TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation increased over the next five years, but 
forward measures of inflation compensation beyond that horizon moved lower.  Broad 
stock price indexes rose ove r the intermeeting period, while spreads of yields on 
corporate bonds over those on comparable-mat urity Treasury securities were little 
changed.  Net debt financing by businesses a nd households remained exceptionally weak.  
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields  
Policy rates implied by futures market quotes  moved down, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  Based on the staff’s standard assump tions about term premiums, investors now 
appear to expect the federal funds rate to remain in the current target range until the 
second quarter of 2010, about one quarter late r than at the time of the August FOMC 
meeting.  Futures quotes imply that market partic ipants expect the fede ral funds rate to be 
about 1¼ percent at the e nd of 2010—about 50 basis points lower than expected in 
August.  Amid data that continued to sugge st a weak labor market  and benign inflation, 
market participants may have come to the view that lower policy rates in the medium 
term would be more consistent with the likel y pace of economic recovery.  At the same 
time, a reduction in option-implied volatility  suggests that term premiums in money 
market rates may have declined somewhat in  recent weeks, indicating that our usual 
assumptions may overstate the extent to wh ich market participan ts have revised down 
their policy expectations.  Cons istent with this interpreta tion, the September Blue Chip 
survey did not indicate a significant change in  the consensus forecast for the path of the 
federal funds rate through the end of next year. And, similar to the August survey, this 
week, 14 of the 17 primary deal ers reported expecting the firs t target rate increase to 
occur in or after the third quarter of 2010. 
Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nomi nal Treasury securities also decreased over 
the intermeeting period, falling 28 and 23 basis points, respectively.  Implied volatility on 
longer-term Treasury yields moved lower over the period suggesting, that, as with money 
market rates, a drop in term premiums wa s one reason for the d ecline in longer-term 
yields.  When asked about the factors contribut ing to the recent decl ine in longer-term

 nominal Treasury yields, primary dealers attributed the most importance to a reduction in 
upside inflation risk, an increase in downside inflation risk, and fore ign official flows.  
TIPS-based inflation compensati on over the next five years increased 26 basis points, on 
net, but five-year inflation compensation five  years forward decreased 25 basis points.  
The intermeeting decline in forward inflation compensation reversed some of the increase 
registered earlier in the summer.  Median inflation expectations  over the next 5 to 
10 years in the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers ticked down 10 basis points, while long-term inflation exp ectations from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters were unchanged. 
Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets 
Changes in investor sentiment toward the banki ng sector were mixed.  Equity prices for 
larger banks increased about 6 percent si nce the August FOMC meeting, while stock 
prices for regional and smaller banks slippe d about 3 percent.  Market participants 
reportedly continued to be wary of the cred it quality of banks’ loan portfolios and the 
ability of smaller banking organizations to ra ise additional capital should the need arise.  
The divergence in equity prices may also par tly reflect the quickening pace of failures of 
smaller banks—21 depository institutions with  combined assets of about $53 billion 
failed over the intermeeting period, and the FDIC ’s list of troubled banks and thrifts 
reached 416, the highest count since 1994.  Nonetheless, CDS spreads for banking 
institutions changed little, on net, since the August FOMC  meeting.  Citigroup was the 
only financial institution to issue FDIC-gua ranteed debt over the intermeeting period; a 
number of firms, however, issued nonguarant eed debt, albeit at so mewhat wider spreads 
than in July. 
Conditions in short-term funding markets im proved a bit further over the intermeeting 
period.  One-month and three-month Libor-OIS spreads have now returned to about the 
levels prevailing before the onset of the fi nancial crisis; longer-t erm Libor-OIS spreads 
also narrowed, though they have remained hi gh by historical standards.  Reports of 
considerable tiering in  the market suggest that many ba nks have been paying well above 
Libor to obtain term funding.  Since the August FOMC meeting, sp reads on A2/P2-rated 
commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP were littl e changed, on net, remaining at the low 
ends of their ranges over the past two years.  
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Total Federal Reserve assets rose about $135 billion over th e intermeeting period, as an 
increase in holdings of securities more than o ffset declines in the us age of liquidity and

1 The New York Domestic Trading Desk announced on September 1 that it would begin to include on-
the-run securities in its agency debt purchases to mitigate dislocations in the agency debt market associated 
with the previous practice of purchasing only of f-the-run securities.  Also, while approximately  
$836 billion of the $1.25 trillion in agency MBS has been purchased to date, due to lags in settlement and other factors, only about $684 billion is currently on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. credit facilities.  Commercial paper held by the CPFF continued to trend down, as did 
credit extended under the TAF.  The Federal Reserve reduced the amount of TAF credit 
offered in August and September, and, despit e reductions in the maximum size of TAF 
auctions from $125 billion to $75 billion, the auc tions continued to be undersubscribed.   
Over the intermeeting period, TALF loans out standing increased about $14 billion, to  
$44 billion.  The August 20 TALF subscription ga rnered $2.3 billion in loan requests for 
legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities, while TALF loans backed by asset-backed securities (ABS) tota led $6.5 billion at the Septem ber 3 subscription.   Cash 
investors who do not use TALF financing have been purchasin g larger shares of TALF-
eligible auto, credit card, and equipment ABS.   However, investors in other categories of 
TALF-eligible ABS have remained h eavily reliant on TALF financing.   
During the intermeeting period, the Federal Re serve purchased a total of $162 billion of 
long-term securities, bringing the System’s cumulative purchases of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS to $283 billion, $125 billion, and $836 billion, 
respectively.
1  Subsequent to the announced ta pering of Treasury purchases, market 
commentary and the primary dealer survey sugg ested that investors expect the FOMC to 
indicate that a similar process will be us ed to wind down the agency debt and agency 
MBS purchases as those programs approach th eir ends.  On September 16, the Treasury 
announced that it would draw down balances held in the Supplementary Finance Program from the current level of about  $200 billion to a level of $15 b illion to provide flexibility 
to manage federal debt with in the statutory debt limit. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Amid somewhat better than expected data  on housing market conditions and aggregate 
spending and lower interest rates, broad stock price indexes rose about  6 percent, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  The staff’s estimate of the expected real equity return over 
the next 10 years for S&P 500 firms decrea sed slightly, while the gap between the 
expected return and real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity risk premium—
remained high by historical standards.  Afte r having come down significantly in prior 
months, option-implied volatility on the S&P 500  index stayed in a relatively narrow 
band at a level broadly compar able with prior recessions.

2 Although, in principle, NIPA profits should exclud e the effects of capital losses (or gains) and write-
downs on debt and securities, the fo urth-quarter drop suggests that m easuring financial firms’ underlying 
operating earnings has been challenging. Yields on investment- and speculative-gra de corporate bonds declined along with 
Treasury yields, leaving their risk spreads l ittle changed.  Staff estimates of bid-asked 
spreads for investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed a bit further, 
indicating the most liquid trad ing conditions seen in about a year.  Conditions in the 
secondary market for leveraged syndicated lo ans also continued to recover, as average 
bid prices rose a bit further and bid-asked spreads narrowed. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Preliminary estimates indicate that the domes tic profits of nonfinancial and financial 
corporations rebounded somewhat through the second quarter after having plunged in the 
latter half of 2008.2  Nonfinancial profits were boosted last quarter by reductions in costs 
for labor and materials.  However, smoothi ng through the quarterly volatility, financial 
corporations’ operating profits did not show signs of a si gnificant turnaround.  Amid 
relatively light earnings news through mid-September, analysts did not substantively 
change their forecasts of year-a head earnings for S&P 500 firms.  
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial  firms have improved, on balance, in recent 
months.  Preliminary estimates suggest that the aggregate ra tio of debt to assets for 
nonfinancial corporations ticked down in th e second quarter, while the aggregate liquid 
asset ratio rose further to nearly its peak level reached in 2004.  The pace of nonfinancial 
corporate ratings downgrades by Moody’s moderate d in the first two months of the third 
quarter, while upgrades remained sparse.  The six-month trailing bond default rate (for all 
U.S. firms) was about unchanged in August, staying well below its le vel in the spring.  
By contrast, the delinquency rate on C&I loans rose further in the second quarter to 
nearly the rate reached in 2002.  In September,  the year-ahead expected default frequency 
for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV remained  close to 2 percent, less than half the 
rate registered in March. 
Business Finance 
Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corpora tions moved back up in August following a 
lull in July; the rebound was particularly str ong for speculative-grade firms, a trend that 
extended into September.  However, on net, commercial paper outstanding was 
unchanged last month, and C&I loans tumbled ag ain.  Overall, net debt financing for the 
nonfinancial business sector remained negative in August.

 Following a sluggish pace in July, last month, gross public equity issuance by 
nonfinancial firms has rebounded, boosted by a pickup in secondary offerings.  Equity retirements from cash-financed mergers and es timated share repurchases were again quite 
modest in the second quarter and were outpaced by issuance.  As a result, net equity 
issuance remained positive.  In July and August, announcements of share repurchase 
programs remained thin, indicating that many corporations continue d to conserve cash.  
Even so, over the same period, a spate of announced cash-financed mergers and acquisitions signaled a pickup in dealmaking from moribund levels. 
Commercial Real Estate Finance 
Credit markets for commercial real estate remained strained.  Outstanding commercial 
mortgage debt is estimated to have decrea sed at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the 
second quarter, and indications suggest another de cline this quarter.  Sales of commercial 
properties have ticked up in recent months but  remained quite light.  In addition, a record 
45 percent of the commercial real  estate property that cha nged hands in August was sold 
at a loss, suggesting that many sellers we re under financial pressure.  Commercial 
property prices edged down further in June, leaving the broad indexes about one-third 
below their levels in early 2007.  Delinquenc y rates on commercial mortgages held by 
banks—particularly those for residential and commercial construction lo ans—continued 
to rise in the second quarter, and, in July, the delinquency rate on securitized commercial 
mortgages remained near its historical hi gh.  Commercial mortgage CDS index prices 
were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
Household Finance 
The average interest rate on 30-year confor ming fixed-rate mortgages declined further 
over the intermeeting period, to about 5.1 percen t, the lowest level recorded since the 
spring.  Spreads between mortgage  interest rates and 10-year Treasury yields were little 
changed, on net.  Agency MBS yields decrea sed around 25 basis points, and issuance of 
MBS by the housing-related GSEs remained very  strong in July.  No private-label MBS 
have been issued since the beginning of 2008. 
Regarding house prices, the re peat-sales price index for existing single-family homes 
from LoanPerformance (LP) jumped 12 percen t at an annual rate in the second quarter, 
and similar indexes constructed by the Fede ral Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and 
S&P/Case-Shiller (CS; this inde x covers 20 large cities) also turned up in recent months.  
Nonetheless, over the year ending in July, the LP index decreased 12 percent, while the 
FHFA and CS indexes dropped about 5 a nd 15 percent, respec tively, through June.

 Delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages continued to rise, and the 
delinquency rate for FHA-backed loans rose to  a record high of nearly 7.5 percent in 
July, about 120 basis points abov e its level at the end of 2008.  
Consumer credit contracted for the sixth c onsecutive month in July, reflecting sizable 
declines in revolving and nonr evolving credit.  Consumer credit ABS issuance decreased 
somewhat in August, but a large volume of TALF-eligible securi ties was issued early this 
month.  Over the intermee ting period, secondary-marke t spreads on AAA-rated credit 
card and auto loan ABS both declined to 50 basi s points, levels not seen in about a year.  
Average interest rates on variable-rate cr edit cards increased 25 basis points over the 
intermeeting period, continuing the trend from earlier this summer.  The number of credit card offers sent by mail remained steady in Ju ly, indicating that th e contraction in the 
supply of credit card loans might be abating.  The latest readings on delinquency rates for 
consumer loans remained high by historical standards. 
As in June and July, long-term mutual funds  attracted sizable inflows in August, with 
bond funds attracting outsized flows.  Mone y market funds continued to experience 
substantial net outflows last month, as yiel ds on such funds remained extremely low. 
Treasury and Agency Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, nine aucti ons of Treasury secu rities totaling  
$254 billion were held.  Considering the very  large volume of securities offered, the 
auctions were generally quite well receive d, with stop-out rates near the when-issued 
rates just prior to the auctions and bid-to -cover ratios near or above their previous 
averages.  Market commentary and eviden ce from indirect bidding at recent Treasury 
auctions suggest that foreign demand for Treasury securities has risen recently. 
No material changes were observed in th e market functioning for nominal Treasury 
securities over the intermeeting period.  Average fitting errors from staff yield curve 
models for nominal Treasury i ssues were little changed.  Bi d-asked spreads held roughly 
steady in recent weeks, and trading volumes st ayed relatively low.  The staff’s measure of 
the on-the-run premium for the 10-year Treasury  note was little changed at an elevated 
level, while premiums for 2- year and 5-year Treasury secu rities stayed very low. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term m unicipal bonds was robust in Au gust, mostly driven by the 
strength in new capital issuance, a substant ial portion of which consisted of Build

 3 The Build America Bonds Program allows state a nd local governments to issue taxable bonds in 
2009 and 2010 for government capita l projects and receive a subsidy payment from the Treasury for 
35 percent of its interest costs.  Issuers can choose eith er to offer the tax credit to buyers or to receive direct 
payment from the federal government.  Most of the Build America Bonds issued so far are direct payment 
bonds. America Bonds, authorized by the fiscal stimulus program enacted earlier this year.3  
Short-term issuance in August doubled the July volume, as some municipalities 
reportedly acted on low short-term yields. Yi elds on long-term municipal bonds declined 
over the intermeeting period, leav ing the ratio to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities about unchanged.  Rating upgrad es in the second quarter again outpaced 
downgrades, as rating agencies continued to transition their ratings for municipalities 
toward the models used for corporate debt. 
Money and Bank Credit 
Following a decline of 3 percen t at an annual rate in Ju ly, the contra ction in M2 
steepened to 7¼ percent last m onth, likely reflecting an incr ease in appetite for risky 
assets and a further reaction to low interest rates on M2 assets.  Both small time deposits 
and retail money market funds contracted much  more rapidly in August than they had in 
July.  Although liquid deposits, the largest co mponent of M2, expanded last month, the  
4 percent growth rate was less than half the ra te posted in July.  In part, the outflows from 
small time deposits and retail money market funds, as well as the smaller rise in liquid 
deposits, may have been associated with the rapid inflows to bond mutual funds in recent 
months.  After having registered  strong expansion in the firs t half of the year, currency 
growth moderated somewhat over July and August.  Currency demand from abroad was 
restrained compared with early  this year amid stabilizing financial conditions around the 
globe; domestic demand remained solid.  The mo netary base rose 9 percent over July and 
August, as the effects of the Federal Reserv e’s large-scale asset purchases more than 
offset reduced usage of the liq uidity and credit facilities. 
Total assets at commercial banks decreased  significantly again in August, as another 
substantial decrease in bank loans more than  offset a considerable increase in cash—a 
category that includes bank reserves—and a furthe r rise in securities.  For most of this 
year, the contraction in co mmercial bank credit had been concentrated at large and 
foreign banks, but, in August, it extended to smaller banks.   
Total bank loans shrank at a rate of 17 per cent last month.  C&I loans dropped at a  
28 percent pace last month with reported pa ydowns of outstanding loans again elevated 
and widespread.  Results from the August Su rvey of Terms of Business Lending showed  
III-18 
III-19 
 
 that C&I loan rate spreads over comparab le-maturity market instruments had risen 
noticeably since the May survey.  The increas e in spreads was evident across most loan 
characteristics, with the exception being a de cline in spreads on lower-risk loans.  In 
August, the runoff in commercial real estate  loans held by banks also intensified.  
Although originations of closed-end resident ial mortgages apparently picked up during 
the intermeeting period, an unusually large volu me of loans were sold to the GSEs, and 
banks’ balance-sheet holdings decreased at an  annual rate of 15 pe rcent last month.  
Revolving home equity and consumer loans on banks’ books also shra nk.  Part of the 
overall weakness in bank loans likely ow es to the further reduction in unused 
commitments to fund loans shown by the second quarter Call Report data .  That said, the 
rate of contraction in unused commitments wa s about half the pace in the fourth quarter 
of 2008 and first quarter of this year. 
Call Report data also show that  the U.S. commercial banking industry registered a loss in 
the second quarter after posting a small gain in  the first quarter.  Th e drop in profitability 
was attributable to a further sizable increase in the rate of provisioning for loan losses and 
by the FDIC’s special asse ssment to bolster its Deposit Insurance Fund.  Despite 
increased provisioning by banks, measures of reserve adequacy declined to historically 
low levels in the second quarter, as net char ge-off and delinquency rates increased to 
their highest levels since at least 1985.  Nonethel ess, regulatory capital ratios rose further, 
as banks’ boosted their capita l buffers while their risk-weighted assets and average 
tangible assets ran off.

U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $32 billion in July from $27.5 billion in 
June, as a strong increase in exports was more than offset by a sizable increase in 
imports. The July figures further solidify the view that trade bottomed out in the second 
quarter. 
The value of exports of goods and services rose 2.2 percent in Ju ly, following a sim ilar 
increase in June and marking the third consecutive monthly increase si nce the April low.  
About one-half of the July increase was in exports of automotive products, which soared 
25 percent as production cutbacks among auto makers eased.  Nearly all other major 
categories of exports also grew, with e xports of computers, consumer goods, and 
industrial supplies exhibiting solid increases .  The increase in exports of industrial 
supplies reflected greater volumes rather than price increases.  
Despite the increases observed in May and June , sharp declines in previous months led 
the average value of exports in the second qua rter to fall 4.6 percent at an annual rate.  
Exports of capital goods exhibi ted the largest decline, with exports of automotive 
IV-2 
products and services also displaying notable decreases.  In contrast , exports of industrial 
supplies and agricultural goods ro se, helped by higher prices.

 The value of imports of goods and services ro se 4.7 percent in July, marking two months 
of increases following the May trough.  As w ith exports, imports of automotive products 
exhibited the largest increase, reflecting some recovery in North American auto 
production.  Imports of consumer goods, capit al goods, and industrial supplies also rose 
sharply.  Imports of oil rose more moderate ly, with the increase in the value of oil 
imports wholly reflecting higher prices , as volumes moved down slightly. 
The average value of imports in the second quarter declined 11.4 percent at an annual 
rate.  Imports of industrial supplies and m achinery registered very large declines.  
Imports of automotive products, consumer goods, and services also moved down, while 
imports of aircraft, computers, and semiconducto rs recorded small increases.  Imports of 
oil rose visibly on account of higher prices, as volumes decreased.   
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   Prices for imported core goods fell 0.2 percent in July and then rose 
0.4 percent in August.  The August increase was the larges t rise since July 2008 and 
reflected a turnaround in the prices for materi al-intensive goods.  In July, prices of 
material-intensive goods declined 0.5 pe rcent but bounced back  with a 1.5 percent 
increase in August, reflecting higher prices fo r foods and primary metals.  Overall prices 
for finished goods were little changed over th e two months; prices for imported consumer 
goods fell 0.2 percent each month, whereas prices for automotive products rose by a 
similar amount.  
After falling modestly in the second quarter, th e average level of co re import prices in 
July and August was 1.1 percent at an annual rate above the second-qua rter average.  The 
reversal mostly reflected price fluctuations for nonfuel industrial supplies, whose prices 
fell 4.2 percent in the second quarter and have increased 3.9 percent so far in the third 
quarter.  Most of the other major categories also saw higher average prices in July and 
August.  The one exception was imported consumer goods, whose average price in July 
and August was 0.8 percent lower.   
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil rose 10.5 percent in 
August on the heels of a 2.6 percent decline in Jul y.  The spot price of West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) crude o il showed only modest volatil ity during August and closed 
most recently on September 15 at $70.93 per barrel, down a touch from the previous 
month’s average price of $71.06.  The modest d ecline in the price of  spot WTI appears

  to reflect positive supply developments; in particular, Russian production has been 
stronger than expected in recent months, once again topping 10 million barrels per day . 
Exports.   Core export p
rices rose 0.9 percent in  August after falling 0.5 percent in July.  
The July price decline mainly reflected a 4.9 percent drop in the pr ices for agricultural 
exports.  Prices for these goods stabilized in August, but prices for non-agricultural 
industrial supplies rose 2.3 percent.  Prices for exported finished goods edged up in both 
July and August.  
The average level of core export prices in  July and August was up 3.8 percent at an 
annual rate from the second-quarter average.  Over this period, prices for exported non-
agricultural industrial supplies were up 10.1 percent.  Prices for exported consumer 
goods, which fell at a 4 percent pace in the second quarter, were 3.6 percent higher, on 
average, in July and August.  In contrast, prices for exported agricultural and automotive 
products fell on average.

U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received  Treasury data on inte rnational financial 
transactions for July that indicate a continued easing of tensions in financial markets and 
further portfolio reallocations  toward riskier securities.  Private foreign investors 
purchased sizable amounts of U.S. equities a nd sold U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. 
investors’ net purchases of foreign securities have returned to their pre-crisis levels.  Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasur ies remained strong in July, although total 
official inflows were damped somewhat  by sales of agency securities.   
 Foreign official inflows in Ju ly (see line 1 of the table “S ummary of U.S. International 
Transactions;” see also the figure “Forei gn Official Financial Inflows through July 
2009”) totaled $43 billion, roughly e qual to the average monthly ra te registered in each of 
the past three years.   
 
 
 .  
More recent custody data from the FRBNY suggest that the pace of foreign official inflows into Treasuries and of outflows from agencies slowed a bit in August.  The figure to the right shows the amounts of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds issued at auctions and the shares allotted to foreign accounts (private and official).  Even though the U.S. Treasury has been issuing more Treasury securities this year, the foreign share of auction allotments has increased notably, suggesting that foreigners continue to participate heavily in Treasury auctions.   Following a trend that began ear lier this year, foreign priv ate investors continued to 
increase their purchases of corporate stocks in July (see line 4d of the table and the 
middle-right panel of the figure “Private Secu rities Flows through July 2009”).  Foreign 
private sales of agencies continued, but at a much slower pace (line 4b).  Net purchases of 
Treasuries (line 4a) and corporate and munici pal bonds (line 4c) remain volatile and were 

IV-10 
 
 
 negative in July.  Overall, foreign private investors recorded an outflow of $16 billion 
from their net sales of U.S. securities in July (line 4).  
Financial outflows associated with U.S. investors’ net purchases of foreign securities 
returned to their pre-crisis level in the second quar ter of this year a nd remained steady in 
July (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure “Private Securities Flows through July 2009”).  
More-stable conditions in interbank funding markets have continued to foster cross-
border lending through private channels, replac ing the funding provided by the Federal 
Reserve swap lines; central banks’ outstandi ng drawings on the swap lines declined to 
$61 billion as of September 11.  The official  inflows associated with the unwinding of 
these swaps are shown in line 2.  Outflows fr om net private bank le nding continued to be 
large in July (line 3). 
The BEA will release the balance of payments  data for the second quarter on September 
16; these data will be discussed in the Greenbook supplement.

  Foreign Financial Markets 
The trade-weighted index of the exchange va lue of the dollar against the major foreign 
currencies has changed little on net since the August Greenbook.  The dollar appreciated 
¾ percent against the Canadian dollar and 3 percent against ster ling, but it depreciated 
1½ percent against the euro, and 4¾ percent against the Japanese yen.  The exchange 
value of the dollar against its other important trading partners has increased ¾ percent, as 
the dollar has appreciated about  2 percent against the Mexica n peso.  This appreciation 
came after the Bank of Mexico signaled that it would scale back its foreign exchange 
intervention. 
Despite upbeat economic indicators, expected policy rates over the next two years and 
sovereign yields declined in major industrial economies.  Market participants attributed 
part of these movements to major central  banks emphasizing their commitments to 
keeping interest rates low.  Although the European Central Bank left its main policy rate 
unchanged at 1 percent, as expected, it surp rised some market participants by announcing 
that it will again charge banks that rate rather than a higher rate for twelve-month funds at 
its upcoming long-term refinancing operati on.  The Bank of England (BoE) surprised 
markets by expanding its asset purchase progr am by £50 billion at its August meeting; 
the minutes showed some support for an even  larger expansion.  On August 12, the BoE 
released its quarterly inflati on report, which market partic ipants interpreted as more 
pessimistic than expected on the outlook for r ecovery.  In connecti on with the release, 
Governor King expressed concern that the remuneration of all reserves at the Bank Rate, 
introduced along with its quantitative easing pr ogram in March, create d a disincentive for 
banks to turn those reserves into other assets .  Some market partic ipants expect the BoE 
to revert to a framework in which reserves exceeding a particular level are remunerated at 
a penalty.   
Headline stock indexes in Europe increased 7 to 8 percent, which market participants 
partly attributed to an improvement in th e economic outlook, but the Japanese stock 
market was down about 3 percent.  CDS spreads on emerging market sovereign debt 
declined slightly, and equity  prices in most major emerging market economies rose 
moderately.  Conversely, China’s A-shares in dex declined 13 percen t, partly driven by 
media reports that authorities were taking actions to moderate  the pace of loan growth in 
China, but H-shares (which consist of shares  of some Chinese companies traded in Hong 
Kong and open to global investors) declined only 1¾ percent.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted more  moderately in the advanced foreign 
economies in the second quarter, with positive gr owth resuming in several countries.   In 
Japan, a trade-related rebound in  industrial production led to a solid increase in output 
despite a sharp fall in private investment and fu rther drag from inventories.   Government 
incentives for automobile purchases contribut ed to a modest expansion of the German 
and French economies, but the euro-area econom y as a whole contracted slightly owing 
to further declines in Spain and Italy; inventory drawdowns continued to weigh on 
activity throughout the euro area.   Canada  and the United Kingdom experienced further 
output drops amid weak exports a nd domestic demand, respectively. 
Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) rose fu rther in the intermeeting period, reaching 
levels consistent with stabilizat ion or moderate expansion of output in the third quarter.   
Confidence indicators also continued to climb, though they remained well below their 
pre-recession levels, in part because households worried about rising unemployment 
rates.   Twelve-month consumer price inflation stayed negative in all major economies, with the exception of the United Kingdom, where it was stable at just less than 2 percent.   
The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of  Japan (BOJ), and the Bank of England 
(BOE) continued the implementation of  their asset-purchase programs. 
Japanese GDP rose a solid 2.3 percent (a.r.) in  the second quarte r following a four-
quarter contraction during which GDP fell more  than 7 percent.   Total second-quarter 
domestic demand dropped 4.0 percent, as a sharp fall in private investment and heightened inventory drawdowns offset soli d consumption growth and a surge in public 
investment.   Private investment has fallen 25 percent from its 2007:Q1 peak.   Net exports contributed 5.1 percentage points to  growth, as exports increased nearly 30 
percent and imports  fell 19 percent. 
Japan’s recovery has been led by a rebound in industrial production.   Although industrial 
production remains depressed compared to pr e-recession levels, it ha s increased nearly 
20 percent since reaching its nadir in February.   Cons istent with the rebound in 
production, both exports and imports  have risen sharply in rece nt months, but also remain 
far below their peak levels.

ith the help of government stimulus, cons umption growth has b een generally solid 
since early spring, and consumer confidence has continued to rise.   However, indicators 
for the housing sector and the labor market remain weak.   July housing starts, at more 
than 25 percent below their level at the beginning of the year , were approaching a series 
low.   The ratio of job open ings to applicants (the numb er of officially posted job 
openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) reached a new record 
low of 0.42 in July.   Employment fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the fastest 12-month decline since 1955.   The unemployment rate increased to 5.7 percent in July, a 
series record. 
Japanese consumer prices fell 2.2 percent over  the 12 months ending in July, in part as 
energy prices continued to put downward pr essure on inflation.   Excluding food and 
energy prices, 12-month consumer pri ce inflation was negative 0.9 percent.

 The BOJ left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting 
period and maintained its program to pur chase commercial pa per, corporate bonds, 
equities, and government bonds.   In August el ections, Prime Minister Taro Aso’s Liberal 
Demorcatic Party received a stunning loss at the hands of the Democratic Party of Japan.   
Yukio Hatoyama was appointed  prime minister in a spec ial Diet session held on 
September 16. 
In the second quarter, the c ontraction of output in the euro area  moderated to 
0.5 percent, with economic ac tivity in Germany and France expanding for the first time 
since early 2008.   Private consumption increa sed almost ¾ percent, led by a surge in 
automobile purchases, but investment continue d to decline, although at a slower pace.   
As in the first quarter, invent ory investment was a significa nt drag on euro-area GDP.   
The decline in imports was deeper than the drop in exports, resulting in a positive 
contribution of net exports to output growth. 
Data received during the intermeeting period po int to a rebound in activity in the current 
quarter.   In August, the business clim
ate and economic sentiment indicators increased 
IV-25 
 
 
 
 further, reaching their highest levels in a year, and the manufacturing and services PMIs 
rose sharply.   The total economy output index currently stands in th e expansion region.   
Industrial orders in June increased at th e fastest pace since early 2008, suggesting that 
manufacturing production is lik ely to pick up in upcoming mo nths.   Industrial production 
and retail sales, on the other hand, edged down in  July.   New car regi strations leveled off 
in July and August, suggesting that the impe tus to growth from government incentives for 
automobile purchases may be waning. 
Conditions in the labor market deteriorated.   The euro-area unemployment rate rose to 
9.5 percent in July, but the pace of increase has moderated to 0.1 percentage point per 
month since the beginnin g of the second quarter.   The ex tent of deterioration in labor 
market conditions remains diverse across countr ies, with the unemployment rate close to 
20 percent in Spain and below 5 percen t in the Netherlands and Austria. 
Twelve-month euro-area inflation was negative  0.2 percent in Augus t, versus negative 
0.7 percent in July.   The downturn in energy pr ices has been an impor tant factor leading 
to a fall in the consumer price index:  Excluding energy and food, August inflation was 
1.2 percent. 
The Governing Council of the ECB kept its benc hmark rate unchanged at 1 percent at its 
September 3 meeting.   The ECB also announced that it will not impose any penalty 
spread over its main refinancing rate at th e next one-year liquidity  operation, scheduled 
for September 30.   In August, the ECB continued to purchase covered bonds in the amount of about €5 billion per month as part of its €60 billion purchase program.

 In the United Kingdom , real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised up to a still-
sizable decline of 2.6 percent.   Private cons umption and especially investment contracted 
further, although both components fell at a some what slower pace than in the previous 
quarter.   The speed of inventory decumulati on moderated for the first time since the third 
quarter of 2007, with the inventor y swing contributing a percenta ge point to GDP growth.   
Net exports continued to add to overa ll demand growth, although both exports and 
imports posted sizable declines. 
Data on activity received since the last Greenbo ok point a return to g rowth in the third 
quarter.   Industrial production rose 0.6 percen t in both June and July after falling more 
than 12 percent from to its pre-recession level.   Retail sales were robust in June and July, 
and the overall index of services  posted its first monthly increa se in June since September 
2008.   The PMI for services hit 54 in August, consistent with an acceleration in the pace 
of services growth late in the quarter, although the PMI for manufacturing, at about 50, 
was consistent only with stabilization. 
Despite signs of recovery in several sect ors of the U.K.  economy, many indicators 
remain weak, particularly those related to the labor market, investment, and lending.   
The Labor Force Survey and the claims-based  measures of the une mployment rate edged 
up to 7.9 percent and 5.0 percent in June a nd August, respectively.   New construction 
orders fell back to near their recent trough in June despite a recovery in house prices and

  property transactions.   According to th e BOE Agents’ Summary of Business Conditions, 
investment intentions in both the services and manufacturing sectors remained depressed 
in July, and 93 percent of industrial firm s surveyed by the Confederation of British 
Industries in the thir d quarter judged that installed capacity was sufficient to meet 
demand over the coming year.   Bank lending to private nonfinancial corporations fell 
3.5 percent in the 12 months to July. 
Pressures on production costs co ntinued to be low in the in termeeting period.   The 12-
month change in average weekly earnings excluding bonuses slippe d to 1.7 percent in 
July, its lowest reading since the series r ecords began in 1996.   Producer input prices 
moved up in August, reflecting higher oil pric es, but remained nearly 8 percent below 
their level a year earl ier.   Headline inflation, at 1.6 percent in August, has fallen at a 
slower rate than expected by most market an alysts in recent mont hs due to higher-than-
predicted pressure from import prices. As of September 10, 2009, the Bank of Engl and had acquired £145.5 billion in assets 
through its Asset Purchase Facility, the vast majority of which (£143.4 billion) were gilts. 
In Canada , real GDP fell 3.4 percent in the second  quarter (a.r.) following a 6.1 percent 
decline in the previous quarter.   The contraction in output wholly reflected a falloff in 
net exports, as exports fell faster than im ports.   Total domestic demand was unchanged 
as consumption rose solidly, investment fell a smaller-than-expected  5.6 percent, and the 
drag from inventory reductions lessened. 
In encouraging news for the third quarter, monthly GDP turned positive in June, increasing 0.1 percent.   Hous ing starts dipped in July but  are up more than 25 percent 
from their April low.   Manufacturing orders  rose 21 percent in June, a pace more than 
double the previous record increase.   Ma nufacturing shipments, however, rose only 
slightly. 
Canadian exports and imports increased markedly  in July.   Real exports rose 4.3 percent 
as shipments of capital goods rose at near -record rates and automotive product exports 
surged 12.5 percent.   Real imports jumped 8.6 percent, also on the back of capital goods 
and automotive products.   Imports of  consumer goods posted solid gains.

  The August employment report was mixed.   Employment rose 27,000; however, the 
increase came solely from part-time work ers.   The number of full-time workers fell 
slightly.   Hours worked declined 0.7 pe rcent in August, and the unemployment rate 
climbed to 8.7 percent. 
Consumer prices fell 1 percent in the 12 months to July.   The decline was due almost 
entirely to energy prices, as inflation excluding food and energy was 1 percent, down 
slightly but within its range over the past several years. 
The Bank of Canada kept its policy rate at 0.25 percent and reiterated its intention, 
conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep  rates at this leve l until the end of the 
second quarter of 2010.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Data confirmed that economic activity in  most emerging market economies rebounded 
strongly in the second quarter, particular ly in Asia, although in Mexico, real GDP 
continued to contract.  Indicat ors of activity in the third quarter point to a continued 
expansion of output.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) have moved into the 
expansionary range in many countries, indicating a rebound in manufacturing.  Trade has been picking up, buoyed in part by Chines e demand, but demand from the advanced 
economies still appears weak.  Inflation pre ssures remain muted, w ith inflation moving 
lower in Latin America and remaining subdued in emerging Asia. 
In China, indicators point to a continued rapid expansion of the economy.  The official 
PMI moved up to 54 in August, and industria l production increased 1.7 percent.  Auto 
production and sales have been very strong, s upported in part by a sales tax rebate on 
purchases of small cars.  Real retail sales have edged up and were 18 percent higher in 
August than a year earlier.  Robust domestic demand has contributed to rising imports, 
although they remain about 17 percent below thei r year-earlier level.  Exports have also 
moved up, albeit to a lesser extent than im ports, resulting in a somewhat narrower trade 
surplus.  The recently released current account balance was $130 billion over the first half of the year, about $60 billion less than ove r the same period of 2008. 
Chinese authorities continue to state that  fiscal and monetary policy will remain 
accommodative until a sustainable recovery is assured, but they have begun to tighten 
policies at the margin.  Author ities have taken some  measures to slow loan growth that 
appear to have been effective, but the pace of lending observed in July and August should 
still be supportive of strong ec onomic expansion.  Despite the rapid loan growth this year, 
there are few indications at this point th at the economy is overheating, and inflation 
pressures remain contained, with consumer  prices in August about 1.2 percent below 
their year-earlier level.

Source: CEIC.IndicatorIndia’s economy grew a robust 7.3 percent at an  annual rate in the second quarter.  
Growth was underpinned by a strong revival in the manufacturing sector as well as 
spending on public works.  The manufacturing PMI remained steady at 55 in July before 
falling slightly to 53 in August, but it remains in the expansionary range.  Exports rose 
for a fourth consecutive month in July; they have now risen 34 percent since March.  The 
sharper rise in imports observed in recent months moderated in July.  Twelve-month 
consumer price inflation spiked in Jul y, as drought conditions in many provinces 
contributed to rising food pri ces.  Wholesale prices have also been rising on a monthly 
basis, but remain below their year-earlier levels.

1 The NIEs are Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Economic recovery in the newly industrialized  economies (NIEs)1 was robust in the 
second quarter, with real GDP in all of the NIEs growing at a double-digit pace.  This 
economic momentum appears to have been maintained in the third quarter, with 
indications of rising domestic demand, stre ngthening external demand (primarily from 
China), and, possibly, easing inventory decu mulation.  Korean industrial production rose 
2 percent in July, led by autos, semiconducto rs, and electronic components.  In August, 
Singapore’s manufacturing PMI rose almost  3 points to more than 54, marking the 
strongest monthly gain sin ce February 2000 and the highest  level of the index since 
November 2006.  Similarly, Taiwan’s manufactur ing PMI rose to 55 in July, including a 
jump in the new orders component to nearly 58.  In addition, high-t ech production in the 
region also continued to bounce back, recording gains in July  of 2½ percent in Taiwan 
and 19½ percent in Singapore.  Some leading indicators for the sector, such as the book-
to-bill ratio (the ratio of orde rs received to the amount of go ods shipped and billed), have 
now exceeded pre-crisis levels. 
In Taiwan, additional fiscal stimulus measur es were recently passed in response to the 
damage caused by Typhoon Morakot.  The perceived poor response to the typhoon led 
the Taiwanese cabinet to resign en masse ; Premier Liu Chao-shiuan was replaced by 
KMT Secretary General Wu Den-yih.  We do not believe the cabinet reshuffling will 
have a significant economic impact. 
Twelve-month consumer price inflation rose to 2.2 percent in August in Korea, led by 
recent increases in food and oil prices.  The re st of the region experienced price deflation 
on a 12-month basis, generally reflecting pr evious declines in commodity prices; 
however, the most recent monthly inflation rates were positive.

kept their policy rates steady in August,  while Bank Indonesia cut its rate from 
6¾ percent to 6½ percent.

Source: Haver Analytics; Bank of Mexico.IndicatorIn Mexico , real GDP continued to contract in th e second quarter, led by the effects of the 
H1N1 flu outbreak and the restructuring of  GM and Chrysler.  Only a few signs of 
recovery have emerged in the third quarter  thus far.  Most significantly, automotive 
production increased sharply.  Consumer and business confidence indexes continued to 
improve, but retail sales have risen only s lightly.  Rising unemplo yment continues to 
restrain household spending.  Exports appear to  have stabilized a nd imports have edged 
slightly higher.  Twelve-month headline cons umer price inflation has moderated further, 
falling to 5.1 percent in Augus t.  It appears that tepid domestic demand and the relative 
stabilization of the peso are beginni ng to make a dent in inflation. 
In early September, President Felipe Ca lderon announced a cabinet reshuffling that 
replaced the attorney genera l, the agriculture secretary, and the director of PEMEX, 
Mexico’s state-owned oil monopoly.  Mid-te rm cabinet changes are not uncommon in 
Mexico (President Calderon’s term runs from 2006 to 2012), but some analysts have 
speculated that the removal of the attorney  general may signal some change in the 
government’s approach to the antidrug war.  All in all, we do not expect these cabinet 
changes to have much economic impact.

Source: Haver Analytics; IMF International Financial Statistics database;       Intituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica.IndicatorIn Brazil, real GDP rose 7.8 percen t in the second quarter following two quarters of 
decline.  The rebound in activity was led by pr ivate consumption, which rose 8½ percent, 
boosted by temporary tax breaks and rapid cred it growth from government-owned banks.  
Exports, particularly of primary commodities to Asia, also soared.  Indicators for the third 
quarter appear to be mixed.  Industrial production jumped in Jul y, and the manufacturing 
PMI moved above 50 in August.  However,  auto production declined over July and 
August.  Despite a jump in Brazilian exports to China in recent months, total Brazilian 
exports have remained fairly constant.  Headline inflation in August fell a touch on a 
monthly basis, and 12-month inflation rema ined about 4½ percent, around the midpoint 
of the inflation target range. 
At its meeting this month, the central bank of Brazil held its po licy rate steady at 
8¾ percent after having reduced the rate a cumulative 500 basis points earlier this year.  
Brazil continues to be the reci pient of net capital inflows, prompting the central bank to 
intervene in the foreign exchange mark et to mitigate upward pressures on the real.  Partly 
because of these interventions, foreign reserv es reached a record high of $220 billion in 
early September.

 Russian  real GDP contracted 2.3 percent in the second quarter, the third straight 
quarterly decline.  However, the most recent  indicators suggest that  the economy is now 
expanding.  Industrial production rose 3.4 percen t from the previous month in both June 
and July.  Fixed capital investment has shown recent strength, but weak consumer 
spending continues to be a drag on growth.  Producer prices rose 2.3 percent in July but 
are still 12 percent lower than their year-earlier leve l.  Consumer prices rose 0.8 percent 
in August, bringing 12-month headline infla tion down to 11.3 percent, the lowest in a 
year and a half.
