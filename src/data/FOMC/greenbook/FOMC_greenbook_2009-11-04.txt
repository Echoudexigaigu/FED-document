With the September employment report, the BLS issued preliminary estimates of the benchmark 
revision to nonfarm payrolls in March 2009 that suggest the level of private payroll employment in that 
month was 855,000 lower than the currently published es timates.  (The benchmark information will not be 
incorporated into the published estimates of employment until February 2010.)  The BLS also has indicated 
that much of this revision came in the first quarter of 2009.  This revision implies that the level of nonfarm 
business productivity in the first quarter of 2009 was around ¬Ω percent above the currently published estimates.  Also, the benchmark revision for last March could lead to downward revisions to the published changes in payrolls for later months; in the past, changes for later months have tended to be revised in the 
same direction as the revision to employment in March.
 Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Note:  An abbreviations list is available at the end of Part 2. On balance, the incoming data suggest that economic activity has continued to move up 
in recent months.  To be sure, the labor ma rket weakened further in September, as job 
losses remained sizable.  None theless, manufacturers increased production in September 
for a third consecutive month.  The gradual recovery in construction of single-family 
homes from its extremely low level earlier in  the year has continued, accompanied by an 
increase in home sales.  Although consumer  spending on motor vehicles plummeted in 
September after the expiration of the ‚Äúcash for clunkers‚Äù program, other household 
spending is estimated to have stepped up in August and September.  And, while business 
spending on nonresidential structures continue d to decline, outlays for equipment and 
software appear to have stabilized after sl umping earlier in the year.  Meanwhile, core 
consumer price inflation has remained subdued in recent months. 
Labor Market Developments 
The labor market weakened further in Sept ember, although the pace of deterioration in 
recent months has been considerably slower than in the first half of the year.  In 
September, private nonfarm payroll em ployment fell 210,000‚Äîabout equal to the 
average monthly decline in the third qua rter as a whole‚Äîand employment losses 
remained widespread across industries.  The average workweek for production and 
nonsupervisory workers ticked down to 33.0 hour s in September, and aggregate hours 
worked for this group fell 0.5 percent.  While  aggregate hours fell at an annual rate of 
3 percent in the third quarter, the pace of decline was much slower than earlier in the 
year.1 
In the household survey, the unemployment ra te edged up in September to 9.8 percent, 
and the labor force participation rate dropped to 65.2 percent.  The participation rate had 
changed little, on net, from the beginning of the recession through the second quarter of 
this year, but it has fallen about ¬æ percenta ge point in recent months; this pronounced 
drop presumably reflects, at least in part, pote ntial workers‚Äô responses to the scarcity of 
employment opportunities.  That said, the par ticipation rate probabl y has received some

II-5support over the past two years from the emergency unemployment compensation 
program and the influence of losses in hous ehold wealth on some individuals‚Äô labor 
market decisions.  Meanwhile, the fraction of  employees working part time for economic 
reasons‚Äîanother manifestation of the underuti lization of labor‚Äîedged up in September. 
Other indicators of labor demand have been  mixed.  Initial claims for unemployment 
insurance moved a little lower in  October but still are at a le vel consistent with additional 
declines in employment.  While the nu mber of persons receiving unemployment 
insurance benefits th rough regular state programs con tinued to drift down, the total 
number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance‚Äîincluding extended and emergency benefits‚Äîremained extraordinarily high.  The layoff rate as measured from 
the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed some improvement in August, but the hiring rate measured from th e JOLTS remained low.  Furthermore, the 
most recent readings for other measures of j ob openings and labor market slack indicate 
continued weakness and showed no evidence of improvement.  Looking forward, the NFIB survey in September found that small fi rms pared back their e xpectations for hiring 
in coming months.  Likewise, household expect ations of future la bor market conditions 
retreated a bit in both the Reuters/University  of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the 
Conference Board survey in early October, bu t both measures remain above their lows 
from the beginning of the year. 
Industrial Production 
Industrial production (IP) rose in Septembe r for the third consecutive month and 
increased at an annual rate of 5¬º percent in the third quarter as a whole.  More than one-
half of the gain in IP last quarter was di rectly attributable to a bounceback in motor 
vehicle assemblies and related parts production from exceptionally low levels earlier this 
year.  Even so, gains in production were wi despread across the industrial sector:  The 
diffusion index of three-month changes in IP jumped in September to its highest level 
since 1997 and indicates that significantly more industries increased production last 
month, relative to thr ee months earlier, than reduced it.   The rise last quarter in 
manufacturing output other than motor vehi cles and related parts likely reflected a 
somewhat slower pace of inventory liquida tion and a pickup in foreign demand, although 
there also was some indirect boost in demand for materials by the motor vehicle sector.  
However, it appears that domestic demand fo r U.S.-manufactured goods other than motor 
vehicles has been relatively flat recentl y.  Moreover, the degree of slack in the 
manufacturing sector remains s ubstantial, as the factory ope rating rate of 67.5 percent in 
September was still only 2.4 percentage point s above the post-1948 low recorded in June.

II-8Production of light motor vehicles continued to  move up last month and rose to an annual 
rate of 6.4 million units in the third quarter as a whole.2  Despite the increase in motor 
vehicle output, inventories fell sharply last qu arter‚Äîin large part because of the boost to 
sales from the cash-for-clunkers program‚Äîa nd days‚Äô supply slid to just 50 days.   
Industry schedules currently call for assemblies to step up in the fourth quarter to a pace 
of 6.8 million units.  Elsewhere in the transportation sector, the production of civilian aircraft moved sideways, on balance, in re cent months.  Production will likely move 
down somewhat over the next several months, as Boeing recently postponed the introduction of their updated 747-8 aircraft; the first deliver ies of the new 787 airplanes, 
as well as the 747-8 aircraft, are not expected  to raise output noticeably until late next 
year.

High-tech output rose at an annual rate of almost 11 percent in the third quarter after 
changing little in the second qua rter.  The output of semiconduc tors increased smartly last 
quarter, reportedly reflecting inventory restocking and possi bly some firming in demand 
for chips used in consumer PCs, cell phones, and TVs.  In contrast, computer production 
declined last quarter, albeit at a slower pace th an in the second quarter, partly a result of 
weak business demand for servers.  This decl ine in real production occurred despite an 
increase in unit shipments of PCs last quarter  because the mix of PCs produced continued 
to shift toward lower-value machines.  Th e output of communications equipment moved 
up modestly in the third quarter afte r two consecutive quarterly declines. 
Forward-looking indicators of high-tech production generally point to some additional improvement this quarter.  Intel is expecti ng a sharp increase in re venue in the fourth 
quarter‚Äîa positive indicator for the output of semiconductors‚Äîand orders for circuit 
boards suggest that output of those items in the coming months will be boosted by upstream demand from the producers of hi gh-tech equipment and other electronic 
products.  While orders and shipments of  semiconductor manufacturing equipment are 
well above the low levels seen during th e second quarter, they remain subdued, 
suggesting that semiconductor manufacturers ar e still cautious about expanding capacity.  
For computers, a number of companies, incl uding Dell and HP, have provided tentative 
signals that the market for their product s has bottomed out and may begin expanding 
                                                 
2 Although GM and Chrysler struggled to ramp up production after emerging from bankruptcy last 
summer, both now appear to be producing closer to their desired assembly rates.  However, Chrysler has 
had some more-recent production disruptions because of difficulties with its parts suppliers.  These 
difficulties reportedly reflect challenges associated w ith Chrysler‚Äôs transition to new suppliers after having 
lost some previous suppliers while in bankruptcy, as well as the reluctance by some smaller suppliers to commit to new projects with Chrysl er because of uncertainty about its future as part of Fiat. 
3 Deliveries of finished aircraft jumped in September after having been held down in the previous two 
months by some parts shortages at  Boeing and by financing issues for some customers.  The pace of 
assemblies, however, appeared little affected, as the swin gs in deliveries were mostly offset by changes in 
inventories.

   Note: Based on survey question on firms' plans to increase or 
decrease their spending on high-tech equipment in the next 12 months.
   Source: NABE Industry Survey.High-Tech Spending Plans
II-11soon.  With regard to communications equipm ent, AT&T reported that it will ramp up 
equipment spending sharply this quarter in  order to reach its annual capital spending 
target, and Verizon also indicated plans to increase its equipment spending.  Finally, the 
diffusion index of planned capital spendi ng on high-tech equipment in the NABE‚Äôs 
quarterly survey rose in the third quarter to a level that s uggests a solid rebound in high-
tech spending in the next few quarters. 
The output of energy increased in both August and September.  Drilling activity rose for 
a second consecutive month in September afte r plunging by more than one-half since late 
last year, and oil extraction moved up for a third consecu tive month.  The boost to both 
extraction and drilling activity was likely spurred by recent increases in oil prices. 
Outside of the transportation, high-technology, and energy sectors, output increased for 
the third consecutive month in September, bri nging the increase for the third quarter as a 
whole to about 3¬Ω percent.  The output of consumer goods edged up in the third quarter, 
construction supplies rose at a moderate pa ce, and the index for materials turned up 
noticeably.  The rise in the pr oduction of construction suppli es likely reflects the upturn 
in housing starts and in state and local construction, while the increa se in the output of 
materials was likely boosted, in part, by de mand from the motor vehicle sector.  The 
production of business equipment was little  changed during the third quarter after 
plummeting in the first half of the year. 
Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity continue  to suggest moderate gains 
in production.  The latest diffusion index of new orders from the national manufacturing 
ISM survey points to solid near-term gains in  factory output, and r eadings on orders for 
October from the regional manufacturing surv eys improved further, on balance, and are 
consistent with moderate increases in ma nufacturing production.  However, the staff‚Äôs 
estimate of real adjusted durab le goods orders in September was about flat, and the latest 
weekly frequency product data that are used to  construct IP suggest that output in these 
industries will contribute little, on net, to the change in IP for October. 
Motor Vehicles 
Light vehicle sales surged in July and August in response to the cash-for-clunkers 
program, but then tumbled in September to an annual rate of 9.2 million units after the 
expiration of the program.  Many of the clunker-related vehicle purchases in July and 
August were probably pulled forward from sale s that would have otherwise occurred in 
subsequent months, as has often been th e case for previous large sales-incentive 
programs, and the steep drop in light vehicle sa les in September was consistent with this

II-13expectation.4  Also, sales incentives were reduced in September, in part because some 
incentives that had been offered in conjuncti on with the cash-for-clunkers rebates were 
trimmed.  Incentives in the fi rst half of October were a bout unchanged, on average, from 
their September level.  The expiration of th e cash-for-clunkers program and the reduction 
in other sales incentives seem to have damped households‚Äô car-buying attitudes as 
measured in the Reuters/Michigan survey for September, and these sentiments continued 
to be little changed in th e preliminary October survey. 
Consumer Spending  
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appear to have increased at a solid pace 
in the third quarter.  Based on our analysis of  monthly retail sales data, we estimate that 
real spending on goods other than motor vehi cles increased further in September after 
rising sharply in August.  For the third quarter as a whole,  real purchases of non-motor-
vehicle goods likely moved up at an annual ra te of more than 4 percent, the largest 
quarterly increase for this categ ory of spending in more than two years.  Moreover, these 
recent gains in household spending have been widespread across categories of consumer 
goods.  The latest readings on consumer spendi ng for services, which lag the indicators of 
goods purchases by a month, also have st epped up; excluding the volatile energy 
component, real spending on services incr eased 0.2 percent in both July and August. 
Despite the apparent resuscitation in consumer  spending, households still face substantial 
headwinds.  Reflecting the ongoing weakness in the labor market, wages and salaries 
appear to have dropped further in  the third quarter after having  plunged in the first half of 
the year.  Although gains in equity prices  likely led to a further recoupment of 
households‚Äô net worth in the thir d quarter, data indicate that, on  net, households have lost 
wealth equivalent to more than 1¬Ω years of income over the past two years and are likely 
still making corresponding adjustments to th eir spending.  Moreover, responses to the 
Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey on Ba nk Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggest that 
many banking institutions continued to tighten consumer lending standards in the third quarter, although a considerable majority re ported that such standards were roughly 
unchanged (see the appendix to ‚ÄúDomestic Financial Developments‚Äù).  Meanwhile, 
consumer sentiment as measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey was about unchanged, on net, in September and early October.  While consumer sentiment has moved up from its extremely depressed levels earlier in th e year, it remains subdued, likely reflecting the 
continued strains on household ba lance sheets and incomes. 
                                                 
4 The cash-for-clunkers program officially ran fr om July 1 to August 24.  All told, about 
690,000 vouchers for cash-for-clunkers rebates were issued under the program, and the Department of 
Transportation announced on October 19 that 98 percent of the vouchers had been paid or approved for 
payment.

II-16Housing  
On balance, the incoming data on residential construction activity  suggest that the 
gradual recovery that began earlier this year has been maintained in recent months.  
Although single-family housing starts were esse ntially flat at an annual rate of around 
500,000 units in August and September, the leve l of starts remained significantly above 
the record low of 360,000 units  in the first quarter of the year.  Adjusted permit 
issuance‚Äîwhich is often a useful indicator  of the underlying pace of starts‚Äîhas also 
been roughly constant in recent months and was only a bit below the rate of starts in 
September.  In the much smaller multifamily sector‚Äîwhere tight credit conditions have persisted and vacancies have remained elevated‚Äîstarts plunged beginning in the middle of 2008 but have basically leveled o ff during the past several months. 
The Census Bureau‚Äôs measure of the number of new-home sales agreements rose to an 
annual rate of about 410,000 units in the th ird quarter following gains also in the 
preceding quarter.   
.  Although sales 
levels are still modest, they have be en ample enough, given the slow pace of 
construction, to reduce the overhang of unsol d new single-family houses.  The stock of 
unsold new homes dropped further in Septembe r, and these inventories were around one-
half of their peak level in the summer of 2006; measured relative to the September pace 
of sales, the months‚Äô supply of new homes also remained lower than earlier in the year. 
Sales of existing single-family homes jumped in the third quarter to an annual rate of 
4.7 million units.  Meanwhile, pending home sales agreements through August suggest that resale activity will conti nue to rise in future months.
5  Although sales in the existing-
home market have been supported for mu ch of the year by the large number of 
transactions involving bank-owne d and other distressed propert ies, resale activity more 
recently appears to have been driven pr imarily by transactions of nondistressed 
properties.  Data from the National Associati on of Realtors suggest that distressed sales 
fell to about 30 percent of all sales transact ions for existing homes in the period from 
May to September after reportedly accounting for more than 40 percent of sales between 
December and April.  
                                                 
5 However, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the high proportion of distressed 
sales and the unusually tight credit conditions in the housing market have made pending home sales a less 
informative leading indicator of existing home sales than  usual.  Increases in the shares of cash purchases 
and of distressed sales have made the time between contract and closing for existing homes more uncertain 
than in the past.

II-19The modest recovery in housing demand that appears to have emerged probably reflects, 
at least in part, improvements in housing a ffordability stemming from relatively low 
mortgage rates and house prices that still rema in below year-earlier levels but that have 
been firming recently, apparently raising expectations of future gains.6  Interest rates for 
conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages remain  very low by historical  standards at about 
5 percent.  In addition, although spreads between rates for ju mbo and standard 
conforming loans are still high re lative to pre-crisis levels, they have continued to fall 
recently despite the fact that the seconda ry market for private-label nonconforming 
mortgages remains closed.  As for house prices , the repeat-sales pr ice index for existing 
single-family homes calculated by LoanPerfor mance increased for a fifth consecutive 
month in August and is now only 10 percent belo w its level a year earlier.  Moreover, the 
Reuters/Michigan survey‚Äôs diffusion index for year-ahead house price expectations 
remained positive in early October, which i ndicates that the number of respondents who 
expect house prices to increase over the next 12 months exceeds the number of 
respondents who expect prices to decrease. 
Equipment and Software 
Real investment in equipment and software (E &S) seems to have stabilized in the third 
quarter after falling steeply for more than a year.  Business purchase s of motor vehicles 
appear to have increased, and purchases of high-tech equipment look to have continued 
their modest recovery.  More broadly, the pace of decline in nominal shipments of 
nondefense capital goods excludi ng aircraft slowed substant ially in the third quarter, 
while orders moved up in September to a leve l slightly above shipments, closing what 
had been a sizable gap. 
Real business outlays on motor vehicles likely rose in the third quarter after declining 
steeply for an extended period.  Purchases of light vehicles by both daily rental 
companies and other businesses moved up last qu arter, as did sales of medium and heavy 
trucks.  In response to a higher volume of fr eight deliveries, the pace of new truck orders 
has picked up noticeably, suggesting that sa les should continue to increase through year-
end. Real spending on high-tech E&S looks to have risen modestly in the third quarter.  Data 
on shipments indicate that re al outlays on computers and peripheral equipment and on 
communications equipment increased at a solid pace last quarter, but company reports 
                                                 
6 Anecdotal reports suggest that th e first-time homebuyer tax credit that  has been in place this year may 
have provided some support to home sales.  The proportion of first-time homebuyers appears to have been 
about 45 percent this year‚Äîonly a little higher than th e average proportion of abou t 40 percent reported by 
the NAR for the past decade‚Äîsuggesting that other factors likely have been more important for increasing 
home sales.

II-22suggest that business purcha ses of software have show n some lingering weakness.  
Looking forward, the NABE index on capital sp ending plans over the next 12 months for 
computers and communications equipment boun ced back noticeably from the low level 
seen since the end of last year, while orders for high-t ech equipment stood somewhat 
above shipments in September.  Meanwhile , major providers of telecommunications 
services, which account for about one-fourth of spending on communications equipment, 
reported that capital expenditures will be ramping up this quarter. 
Business investment in equipment outside of transportation and high tech looks to have 
bottomed out in the third quarter after falling steeply during the preceding three quarters.  
Although shipments of these capital goods, wh ich account for one-half of total E&S 
outlays, edged down, on net, in recent months , new orders jumped in September and the 
stock of unfilled orders increased for the firs t time in the past year, which could provide 
some impetus for shipments in future months. The fundamental determinants of investment in E&S have improved somewhat in recent 
months, but, on balance, they point to onl y sluggish gains over the next couple of 
quarters.  Business output appears to have turn ed up in the third quart er, and the user cost 
of capital has continued to fall in line with  bond yields.  Although spreads of corporate 
bonds over Treasury securities are still some what elevated, they have decreased 
considerably from their extremely high levels at  the end of last year and continue to edge 
lower, likely reflecting less un certainty and better assessments  of future profitability.  
Meanwhile, monthly surveys of business condi tions and sentiment have recovered to 
levels suggesting a modest rise in business spending.  However, the net share of small 
businesses reporting increased difficulty in obtaining credit edged up in the September 
NFIB survey, and the October SLOOS reported that banks, on balance, continued to 
tighten standards on commercial and industrial loans to firms of all sizes over the past 
three months. 
Nonresidential Construction 
Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector have generally remained bleak.  
Recent data on nominal expenditures for nonres idential structures suggest that real 
construction outlays outside of the energy-related sectors de clined sharply in the third 
quarter.  The weakness was widespread acro ss categories and likely reflected the drag 
from rising vacancy rates and plunging propert y prices.  In additi on, the architectural 
billings index in September remained at le vels consistent with further declines in 
spending, and the nonresidential construction in dustry has continued to shed workers.  
Finally, the responses to the October SLOOS suggest that it remains extremely difficult 
for businesses to obtain financi ng for new construction projects.

II-25Real spending on drilling and mining structures slumped in the first half of the year, and 
available indicators suggest that activity more  recently has only edged up from a very low 
level.  The steep drop in energy prices in the second half of last year greatly weakened 
incentives for additional drilling activity, part icularly in the natural gas sector, which 
accounts for most rigs in operati on.  However, the rebound in oil prices this year seems to 
have led to an increase in oil drilling activity. 
Business Inventories  
The sharp cuts in production earlier this ye ar markedly reduced business inventories.  
Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehi cles fell at an annual rate of $115 billion 
in the second quarter, and the more recent book-value data for the manufacturing and 
trade sector suggest that inventories continued to fall at a similar pace in the third quarter.  
Although the measure of months‚Äô supply (exc luding motor vehicles) implied by the book-
value data has declined considerably in re cent months, it remains somewhat elevated, 
especially for some categories of durable goods in manufacturing a nd wholesale trade.  
Similarly, the staff‚Äôs flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventories continued 
to contract in the third quarter, but that  months‚Äô supply for most major market groups 
(excluding motor vehicles) is still elevat ed even after the de clines seen through 
September; progress in reducing months‚Äô supp ly has been most apparent for consumer 
goods.  In contrast, a relatively low net fr action of manufacturing supply managers 
surveyed by the ISM in September perceived their customers‚Äô inve ntories as being too 
high, which could suggest that purchasing ma nagers in manufacturing may believe their 
customers will be doing some restocking in the coming months.7 
Federal Government Sector 
The unified federal budget finished fiscal year 2009 in Septembe r with a deficit of 
$1.42 trillion, which is about 10 percent of GDP.  The budget deficit was almost 
$1 trillion wider than in fis cal 2008, primarily reflecting the budget costs of the fiscal 
stimulus and the financial st abilization programs and a re cession-related increase in 
outlays and a decline in revenues.  The si zable jump in the bu dget deficit pushed up 
federal debt held by the public from 40 per cent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2008 to 
53 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2009. 
                                                 
7 The question asked of purchasing managers in the ISM survey about whether stocks are too high or 
too low does not specify the measure of sales against which respondents should compare the level of their 
customers‚Äô inventories.  If the resp ondents are evaluating inventories relative to a level of sales expected in 
coming months that is noticeably higher than the recent pace of sales (a plausible assumption given the 
marked improvement in recent months of the ISM‚Äôs new orders index), the sharp drop in this measure of customers‚Äô inventories to a very low level is not necessarily at odds with the inventory ratios in both the 
book-value data and the staff‚Äôs flow-of-goods system.

II-27For fiscal 2009 as a whole, outlays associated  with the TARP and th e conservatorship of 
the GSEs totaled about $260 billion.  But ev en excluding the costs of these financial 
stabilization programs, other federal spendi ng was about 10 percent higher than that in 
the preceding fiscal year.  Spending under this  year‚Äôs fiscal stimulus bill amounted to 
about $110 billion, and transfer payments‚Äîpar ticularly for unemployment insurance and 
other low-income support programs‚Äîwere boos ted by the weak conditions in the labor 
market.  In the period from July to September, defense spending rose solidly relative to 
the same period a year earlier; the level of sp ending points to a substa ntial increase in the 
NIPA measure of real defense purchases in the third quarter following a marked surge in 
the second quarter. 
Receipts in fiscal 2009 were roughly 17 percen t lower than in the preceding year.  The 
drop in revenues primarily reflected the effect s of the recession as wages and salaries 
have waned, capital gains realizations have likely contract ed, and profits have slumped.  
Also, this year‚Äôs stimulus plan is estimated to have reduced tax receipts by more than 
$80 billion in fiscal 2009.8  Summing these stimulus-related tax cuts with the stimulus 
spending noted earlier shows that more than $19 0 billion in total stimulus funds had been 
distributed by September, about one-fourth  of the total $787 billion stimulus package.  
State and Local Government Sector 
Purchases by state and local governments likely d eclined in real terms in the third quarter 
as governments took additional steps to addr ess imbalances in their operating budgets.  
According to the latest labor market re port, state and local employment fell 47,000 in 
September, and estimates for July and August were revised down to show a cumulative 
drop of 84,000 during those two months; payrolls at both the state and local levels have 
fallen sharply over the past three months afte r registering small dec lines during the first 
half of the year.  In addition to laying  workers off, many governments have furloughed 
employees‚Äîan action that does not show up in  the employment figures for the sector‚Äîto 
further reduce their compensation costs.  Meanwhile, real cons truction expenditures 
appear to have risen somewhat in July and August after increasing at  an annual rate of 
25 percent in the second quarter.  The uptur n in real construction spending followed a 
steep drop in late 2008 and early 2009 and is li kely attributable to a number of factors, 
including the availability of federal stimulus grants and the easing of credit conditions in 
the municipal bond market.  A moderation in cons truction costs is also helping states and 
localities make the most of the f unding available for capital projects. 
                                                 
8 While the 2009 stimulus plan is estimated to ha ve reduced tax receipts by more than $80 billion in 
fiscal year 2009, the tax cuts in the 2008 stimulus plan  lowered taxes by about $100 billion in fiscal 2008.  
Thus, tax cuts associated with fiscal stimulus actions have not contributed to the year-over-year decline in 
revenues.

II-29Prices 
Consumer price inflation has remained s ubdued in recent months after decelerating 
noticeably over the past year.  Our transla tion of the recent read ings on the consumer 
price index (CPI) and the producer price inde x (PPI) suggests that both the headline and 
core PCE price indexes edged up 0.1 percent in September.  Core PCE prices are 
estimated to have risen at an annual rate of only 1¬º percent over both the most recent 
3- and 12-month periods.  Headline PCE prices declined  ¬Ω percent over the past 
12 months, largely because of the plunge in  energy prices at the end of 2008 and the 
decline in food prices over th e past year, but they have risen 2 percent over the past 
three months as energy prices surged.  M eanwhile, survey measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations have  stayed within the range seen in recent years. 
Consumer energy prices rose la st quarter, largely in respons e to the rebound in crude oil 
prices this year.  Prices pa id by consumers for energy jump ed 5 percent in August, and 
we estimate that they edged up another 0.7 pe rcent in September.  Recent survey data 
point to gasoline prices steppi ng up in October, and prices of  crude oil have moved up, on 
net, in recent weeks, portending some upward pressure to energy prices in the coming 
months.  After falling from an elevated level in the middle of last year, natural gas prices have, on balance, been roughly flat since this  summer, but futures pr ices for natural gas 
currently tilt noticeably upward. 
Consumer prices for food have remained soft.  After rising only 0.1 percent in August, 
food prices are estimated to have fallen 0.2 percent last month and to have declined 
1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, primarily reflecting the weak 
economy and ample supplies.  Prices in fa rm commodity markets have been mixed 
recently:  Grain prices, on balance, have moved up since the time of the September 
Greenbook because of concerns about frost dama ge to crops that were planted late, but 
livestock prices have continued to move down over this period. 
PCE prices excluding food and energy have conti nued to rise slowly in recent months.  
We estimate that core PCE prices increased 0.1 percent in September, the same pace as in the preceding two months.  Wh ile core nonmarket prices have  turned up in the past two 
quarters after posting sizable dec lines earlier in the year, core market-based prices have 
risen more slowly.  In particular, prices for housing services and for many durable goods 
declined over the three-month period ending in September. 
In the preliminary Reuters/Michigan survey for October, median year-ahead inflation 
expectations moved up to 2.8 per cent, retracing their dip in Se ptember.  Median inflation 
expectations over the next 5 to 10 years e dged up from 2.8 percent in September to

At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for co re intermediate materials rose 0.9 percent in 
September after also increasing in the prev ious three months; even so, the index has 
retraced only a fraction of its decline ove r the preceding eight months.  Commodity 
prices (excluding oil and gas)  have risen significantly sin ce the beginning of the year, 
likely reflecting, at least in part, improvement in global econ omic activity.  Since the time 
of the September Greenbook, the Journal of Commerce  (JOC) index of industrial

8 percent, and the Commodity Research Bureau  (CRB) spot index of industrial materials

  Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview  
Market expectations for the path of the fede ral funds rate and nominal Treasury yields 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Risk premiums on corporate bonds 
declined a bit further, and some spreads in  money markets edged lower.  Stock prices 
were about unchanged and the equity premiu m remained wide.  Meanwhile, net debt 
financing by nonfinancial businesses remained muted as C&I loans con tinued to run off.  
In the household sector, the 30-year fixed ra te for mortgages was little changed, while 
delinquency rates on prime and nonprime mortgages continued to rise.  Banks reported 
further tightening in lending standards and terms as well as weaker demand for most 
types of loans to businesses and households, on net, in the October Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey.  Credit card ABS issuance st opped amid uncertainty about the FDIC‚Äôs 
treatment of these securities in the event of a bank failure .  Amounts outstanding in most 
of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs liquidity and cr edit facilities continued to decline. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields  
Policy rates implied by federal fund futures ma rket quotes were little changed, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  Based on the st aff‚Äôs standard assumptions about term 
premiums, investors apparently continued to expe ct the federal funds rate to remain in the 
current target range until the second quarter of 2010 and to reach about 1¬º percent by the 
end of 2010.  The expected policy path m oved down following the release of the 
September FOMC statement and some weaker-t han-expected data releases, but increased 
amid speeches by Federal Reserve offici als and better-than-expected earnings 
announcements.  Staff models indicate that te rm premiums on federal funds futures rates 
remain elevated, suggesting that investors may expect policy to tighten somewhat later 
than the second quarter of 2010.  According to  the Desk‚Äôs primary dealer survey, 14 of 
the 18 reporting primary dealers expect the firs t target rate increase to occur in or after 
the third quarter of 2010. 
Intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasu ry yields were little changed during the 
period.  Yields on TIPS declined noticeably, however, resulting in an increase in near-
term inflation compensation of 29 basis points.  Increases in oil prices may have boosted 
near-term inflation expectations , though staff models indicate that an increase in TIPS 
liquidity may have been a factor.  Five-yea r forward inflation compensation five years 
ahead was little changed.

 Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets  
Investor sentiment toward the banking sect or deteriorated a bit over the intermeeting 
period.  While third-quarter earnings resu lts at some large banks were boosted by 
revenues in investment banking and securitie s trading, market participants reportedly 
remained concerned about the earnings prospects for the banking sector in an 
environment of weak economic activity and rising  loan losses.  On net, equity prices for 
large banks declined about 9 percent, while  prices for regional and smaller banks fell 
about 4 percent over the period.  CDS spr eads for large bank holding companies were 
about flat, but they widened for regional a nd smaller banking organizations.  According 
to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs weekly bank bala nce sheet data, commerc ial banks added more 
than $13 billion to thei r allowances for loan  and lease losses in  the third quarter. 
Conditions in short-term funding markets eased a bit further over the intermeeting period.  One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads re mained around pre-crisis levels, while six-
month spreads‚Äîstill somewhat elevated by historical standards‚Äîcontinued to narrow.   
Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper a nd AA-rated ABCP were little changed, on 
net, remaining at the low end of  their ranges over the past two years.  Overall, year-end 
pressures in funding markets appear quite modest; however, there is some evidence of increased demand for Treasury securities that  mature soon after the turn of the year, 
suggesting some flight-to-quality  demands related to year-end. 
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities  
Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserve assets edged up, as increases in 
securities outpaced declines in credit extensi ons under the credit and liq uidity facilities.  
As of October 28, the Federal Reserve purch ased a total of about $105 billion of long-
term securities during the intermeeting period, bringing the System‚Äôs cumulative 
purchases of Treasury securities, agency  debt, and agency MBS to $298 billion,  
$140 billion, and $977 billion, respectively.
1 
Usage of Federal Reserve credit facilities dec lined further over the intermeeting period.  
TAF auctions continued to be undersub scribed, and TAF credit extended dropped 
29 percent over the intermeeting period.  Co mmercial paper held through the CPFF also 
decreased at the end of October when a subs tantial portion of the paper matured and was 
funded outside the program.  TALF credit outstanding moved sideways as modest new 
                                                 
1 Although approximately $977 billion of the $1.25 trillion in agency MBS has been purchased to date, 
only about $775 billion is currently on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs balance sheet due to lags in settlement and 
other factors.

 loan extensions were offset by early loan repayments.  The October 2 TALF subscription 
garnered $2.4 billion in loan requests backed by ABS (supporting seven ABS deals 
totaling approximately $6.5 billion).  The October 21 CMBS TALF subscription saw 
$2.1 billion in loan requests to finance legacy assets.  
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates  
Broad stock-price indexes were about uncha nged, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
despite an initial wave of third-quarter ear nings reports that mostly beat analysts‚Äô 
forecasts.  The staff‚Äôs estimate of the expect ed real equity return over the next 10 years 
for S&P 500 firms was little changed at about its average levels dur ing the recession of 
the early 1990s.  As a result, the gap between the expected return and the real 10-year 
Treasury yield‚Äîa gauge of the equity risk pr emium‚Äîremained elevated and in line with 
weak economic activity.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index was little changed, on balance.  
Over the intermeeting period, corporate bond yiel ds fell a bit, while those on comparable-
maturity Treasury yields were about flat, leaving spreads on invest ment- and speculative-
grade corporate bonds 12 and 44 basis poi nts lower, respectiv ely.  Corporate bond 
spreads are now comparable to average levels  in the previous recession.  Estimates of 
bid-asked spreads for investment- and specu lative-grade corporate bonds‚Äîa measure of 
liquidity in the corporate bond market‚Äîremaine d steady at moderate levels.  Conditions 
in the leveraged loan market continued to improve, as average bid prices rose a bit further 
and bid-asked spreads narrowed. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality  
To date, about half of the firms in the S&P 500 have reported third-quarter earnings, and 
thus far most reports have come in well above expectations.  On the basis of these reports 
and analysts‚Äô estimates for the rest, it a ppears that earnings per share among S&P 500 
firms in the third quarter were on par with  second-quarter resu lts, which had been 
boosted by some large one-time gains.  In addi tion, revisions to analys ts‚Äô expectations of 
year-ahead earnings for nonfinancial S&P 500 firms were a bit above zero, on balance, in 
mid-October, largely due to the stronger-than- expected earnings reports over the past few 
weeks. 
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinanci al firms improved a bit in recent months.  
The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations ticked lower in the 
second quarter, while the aggregate liquid asset ratio rose to around its peak level in

 2004.  The pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by Moody‚Äôs moderated 
substantially in the third qua rter, while the pace of upgrades ticked up.  The six-month 
trailing bond default rate for all U.S. firm s edged down in September and is now below 
its peak level in the previous recession.  The year-ahead expected default frequency for 
nonfinancial firms from Moody‚Äôs KMV inched down further in October to just below  
2 percent, well off its peak level in March. 
Business Finance 
Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations has slowed 
somewhat in October, even as speculative-gr ade firms have continued to issue bonds at a 
robust pace.  Commercial pa per outstanding turned positive, but the gains were not 
widespread across programs.  C&I loans contin ued to contract signif icantly, albeit at a 
slower rate than in Septembe r.  All told, net debt financ ing by nonfinancial businesses is 
on pace to post a small gain in October. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms through seasoned and initial public 
offerings has been solid in October, though notic eably below its robust September pace.    
In the second quarter, equity retirements from estimated share repurchases slowed 
further, while retirements from cash-financed  mergers remained low.  As a result, net 
equity issuance in the second quarter stayed positive.  In the third quarter and in early 
October, announcements of new share repurc hase programs were sparse, likely due to 
corporations‚Äô continuing effort s to preserve liquidity.  By  contrast, announcements of 
mergers and acquisitions rebounded, boosted by both strategic deals as well as acquirers‚Äô 
renewed interest in potentia l opportunities to restruct ure distressed companies. 
Equity issuance by financial firms slowed in October from a solid September pace. 
Issuance of bonds by financial firms remained  robust, with about 20 percent offered 
under the FDIC‚Äôs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.2  Citigroup and GE Capital 
accounted for all of the FDIC -guaranteed debt issuance. 
Commercial Real Estate Finance  
The commercial real estate sector remained strained.  Outstanding commercial mortgage debt decreased at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent in the second quarter and recent data 
                                                 
2 The TLGP in its current form will expire on October 31; however, the FDIC announced a modified 
extension to the program through April 2010 that is intended as an emergency facility.  This extension 
carries significant restrictions on the use of the program‚Äîissuance approval will be given only on a case-
by-case basis (requiring an inability to issue debt in the nonguaranteed market) and will be coupled with 
much higher fees.

 suggest another decline in the third quarter.  The dollar valu e of commercial real estate 
sales edged down in September as just under ha lf of properties were sold at a nominal 
loss.  Commercial property prices decreased  3 percent in August, leaving the index at 
about its mid-2003 level and 41 percent below its peak.  Delinquency rates on securitized 
commercial mortgage pools increased in Sept ember to 4.3 percent, more than reversing 
the slight decrease in August.  Commercial mortgage CDS index prices for senior AAA 
pools were about flat, on net, but decreas ed for junior AAA and BBB-minus pools over 
the intermeeting period.  No CMBS has been is sued this year, but ot her CRE sectors have 
seen some interest from investors.  Real esta te investment trusts (REITs) have raised over 
$15 billion this year in equity and uns ecured debt, reportedly to pursue bargains. 
Household Finance  
The average interest rate on 30-year conf or
mi
ng fixed-rate mortgages stayed near 
5 percent over the intermeeting period; spr eads between mortgage interest rates and  
10-year Treasury yields were little cha nged.  Agency MBS yields were also about 
unchanged, on net, and issuance of MBS by th e housing-related GSEs was strong again 
in August.  Anecdotal reports  suggest that the tapering of  Federal Reserve agency MBS 
purchase has, to date, placed only modest upward pressure on MBS yields.  No private-
label MBS have been issued  since the beginning of 2008. 
According to the repeat-sales index from LoanPerformance (LP), house prices increased 
for the fifth consecutive month in August,  rising 8.9 percent at an annual rate.  
Nonetheless, over the year ending in August, the LP index decreased 10 percent.  House 
price indexes from the Federal Housing Fina nce Agency and S&P/Case-Shiller suggest 
similar year-over-year rates of decline.   Delinquency rates on prime and subprime 
mortgages continued to climb, and the delinqu ency rate for FHA-backed loans rose to 
nearly 8 percent in September. 
Consumer credit contracted for the seve nth consecutive month in August, reflecting 
declines in revolving and nonr evolving credit.  Consumer ABS issuance decreased in 
October for both TALF-eligible and non-TALF-eligible securiti es.  Issuance of credit 
card ABS is likely to be subdued until the FDIC clarifies how it would handle these 
securities in the ev ent of a receivership of a sponsoring bank.3  The number of credit card 
                                                 
3 Over the intermeeting period, Moody‚Äôs and Fitch join ed Standard & Poor‚Äôs in declining to rate credit 
card ABS as AAA (unless the sponsoring bank‚Äôs rating is AA or higher) until the FDIC provides guidance 
on whether it would repudiate the secu ritization contract in the event of  a bank receivership. The FDIC‚Äôs 
current guidance establishes a safe harbor from repudiation for ABS that are off-balance sheet under FASB

 offers sent to households by mail remained stea dy at low levels in A ugust, but the interest 
rate offered on these credit card mailings edge d up.  The latest readings on delinquency 
rates for consumer loans remained high by historical standards. 
As in recent months, long-term mutual funds received sizable inflows in September, as 
continued outsized flows to hybrid and bond fu nds more than offset net redemptions of 
equity funds.  Money market mutual funds experienced further substantial net outflows 
last month, as yields on such funds remained extremely low. 
Treasury and Agency Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasur y auctioned $190 billion of coupon-bearing 
securities, including $7 billion in TIPS.  Th e auctions were generally well received, 
although the 30-year bond elicited relativel y less strong demand.  Demand for the re-
opened 10-year TIPS was strong, and the aucti on recorded the highest  bid-to-cover ratio 
since the inception of the TIPS program.  Mu tual fund flow data indicate that retail 
demand for TIPS has risen in recent months rela tive to its historical  average.  Foreign 
demand at auctions of both nominal and TI PS securities strengthened.  As previously 
announced, the Treasury ran down the outstanding  amount of short-term bills associated 
with its balances in the Supplementary Financing Program to about $15 billion; the 
reduction in bill supply was reportedly associ ated with some downward pressure on bill 
yields. 
Treasury market functioning showed some further signs of improvement over the 
intermeeting period.  Average ab solute fitting errors of th e staff‚Äôs nominal Treasury 
curve‚Äîa proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportun ities in the nominal Treasury market‚Äî
declined slightly over the intermeeting period.  On-the-run premiums on the 10-year 
Treasury note continued to decline, although they remained signifi cantly above their pre-
crisis levels.  Finally, fails-to-deliver in the Treasury market remained low.  Trading volumes in both nominal and TIPS markets increased but remained below those observed in previous years.   
State and Local Government Finance  
Conditions in the municipal bond market were  little changed over the intermeeting 
period.  In October, gross issuance of long- term municipal bonds has continued at a 
robust pace, while short-term issuance moderate d in line with typica l seasonal patterns.

 Yields on long-term municipa l bonds rose about 11 basis points over the intermeeting 
period, and the ratios of yields on long-te rm municipal bonds to comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields were unchanged on net.  Rating upgrades in the second quarter again 
outpaced downgrades, as rating agencies continued to change the rating scale for municipalities toward the more leni ent scale used for corporate debt.  
Money and Bank Credit  
M2 expanded at a moderate 4 percent annual rate in September and has risen at an 
estimated 3 percent pace in Oc tober.  While liquid deposits grew rapidly over this period, 
small time deposits and retail money market  mutual funds continued to contract.  
Meanwhile, currency growth averaged 3 percent in September and October amid moderate demand from abroad.  Growth in th e monetary base averaged about 89 percent, 
primarily reflecting an increase in reserve ba lances due to additional purchases of long-
term assets and the decline in the Treasury‚Äôs Supplementary Financing Account. 
The runoff in bank credit steepened in September as the decrease in core loans intensified 
to an 18 percent annual rate.  According to the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 
on Bank Lending Practices, standards and term s tightened further and demand continued 
to decline, on net, for most types of loan s in the third quarter (see appendix to this 
section).  On the business side, C&I loans dr opped at a 32 percent pace, with maturities 
and steady paydowns reported acro ss a wide variety of industries.   Commercial real estate 
loans also continued to decrease, reportedl y due to widespread paydowns and charge-
offs.  Residential mortgage loans on banks ‚Äô books also ran off more quickly, with 
substantial loan sales to the GSEs continuing to more than offset strong originations.  
Revolving home equity loans and consum er loans also contracted, even though 
commercial banks continued to br ing credit card assets back onto their books.  The drop 
in total loans at large banks continued to substantially outpace the decline at smaller banks.  The allowance for loan and lease losses rose further at large banks in September, but it was about unchanged at small banks.  
Fifteen depository instituti ons, with aggregate assets of $5.2 billion, failed over the 
intermeeting period.  Thus far in 2009, there have been 118 failures,  the highest annual 
total since 1992.

 Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices 
The October 2009 Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed 
changes in the supply of and demand for loans to  businesses and households over the past three 
months.  The survey also included three sets of special questions:  The first asked banks about the 
reasons for the decline in commercial and industri al (C&I) loans over the first eight months of 
2009, the second asked banks about the status of commercial real estate (CRE) loans on their 
books that were scheduled to mature by Septembe r of this year, and the third asked banks about 
potential changes in credit card lending due to im plementation of the Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure (Credit CARD) Act.  This appendix is based on responses from 57 domestic banks and 23 U.S. bran ches and agencies of foreign banks.
1 
In the October survey, domestic banks indicated that they continued to  tighten standards and 
terms over the past three months on all major types of loans to businesses and households.  
However, the net percentages of banks that tightened standards and terms for most loan 
categories continued to decline from the peaks reache d late last year.  The exceptions were prime 
residential mortgages and revolving  home equity lines of credit, which registered little change in 
the net fractions of banks that had tightened standards.2  A small net fraction of branches and 
agencies of foreign banks eased standards on C&I loans, while a significant net fraction 
continued to tighten standards on CRE loans.  Demand for most major categories of loans at 
domestic banks reportedly continue d to weaken, on balance, over the past three months.  This 
weakening was somewhat less widesp read than in the July survey for C&I loans, CRE loans, and 
nontraditional mortgages; approximately the same  for consumer loans; and significantly more 
widespread for home equity lines of credit.  However, banks reported stronger demand, on net, for prime residential real estate loans.  Demand for C&I and CRE loans at foreign banks continued to weaken, on balance, but the weakeni ng was somewhat less wid espread than that in 
the July survey.  
In response to a special question on the sources of  the decline in C&I lending this year, the two 
sources that domestic banks cited most ofte n as being ‚Äúvery‚Äù important were decreased 
originations of term loans and decreased draws on revolving credit lines.  In response to a second 
special question, banks indicated that, of the CRE  loans on their books that were scheduled to 
                                                      
1 Respondent banks received the survey on or after October 6, 2009, and their responses were due by 
October 20, 2009. 
2 For questions that ask about lending standards, reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
banks that reported tightening standards (‚Äútightened considerably‚Äù or ‚Äútightened somewhat‚Äù) minus the 
percentage of banks that reported easing standards (‚Äúeased considerably‚Äù or ‚Äúeased somewhat‚Äù).  For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net percen tages equal the percentage of banks that reported 
stronger demand (‚Äúsubstantially stronger‚Äù or ‚Äúmoderately stronger‚Äù) minus the percentage of banks that 
reported weaker demand (‚Äúsubstantially  weaker‚Äù or ‚Äúmoderately weaker‚Äù).

 mature by September of this year, more loans had been extended than refinanced both for 
construction and land development loans and fo r loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real 
estate.  In response to special questions con cerning the Credit CARD legislation passed in May 
2009, the majority of banks reported that they had yet to fully comply with the new law.  Banks 
indicated that they expected to tighten many of  the terms and conditions of credit card loans as a 
result of the legislation, with the notable ex ception of penalty fees and the length of the grace 
period for payments, which banks, on net, reported they would ease.   
Lending to Businesses 
Questions on
 commercial and industrial lending.  The net fraction of banks that reported 
tightening standards on C&I loans to firms of all sizes was about 15 percent, about one-half of the 
net fraction that reported doing so in the July su rvey and substantially below the peak of around 
80 percent that was reported in the October 2008 survey. 
The net fractions of domestic respondents that reported having tightened selected terms on C&I 
loans remained fairly elevated, but generally co ntinued to fall from the highs reported in late 
2008.  Approximately 40 percent of banks, on net, reported increasing spreads of loan rates over 
their cost of funds for large and middle-market  firms and about 45 percent reported boosting such 
spreads on loans to small firms.  By comparison,  about 60 percent and 65 percent of banks, on 
net, reported raising spreads for loans to large and middle-market firms and to small firms, 
respectively, in July.  Nearly 40 percent of respondents reported increasing the premiums charged on riskier loans to firms of all sizes.  By contr ast, only between 5 and 20 percent of banks, on net, 
reported decreasing the maximum maturity of loan s or credit lines, decreasing the maximum size 
of credit lines, and tightening terms on loan covena nts for loans to firms of all sizes.  Indeed, 
some banks reported easing a few loan terms. 
The predominant reasons cited for tightening cred it standards or terms for C&I loans were the 
same as those reported in the previous three surveys.  Respondents that tightened standards most 
commonly cited the reason as being a reduced to lerance for risk, followed by an economic 
outlook that was less favorable or more uncertain , and a worsening of industry-specific problems.  
Each of the six domestic banks that reported easing loan terms in the latest survey cited more 
aggressive competition from other banks or nonba nk lenders as the most important reason for 
doing so. 
Notable net fractions of domest ic banks reported weaker demand for C&I loans from firms of all 
sizes, though the weakening was less widespread th an in the July survey.  In July, roughly 
50 percent of domestic banks reported weaker dema nd for C&I loans to firms of all sizes; that 
fraction fell to roughly 30 percent and to 35 percen t for loans to larger and to smaller firms, 
respectively, in October.  The predominant r easons for reduced demand were similar to those 
cited in the July survey and included decreases in the need to finance investment in plant and 
equipment, inventories, accounts receivable, and merger and acquisition activity.

 For the first time since the April 2007 survey, a positive net share of U.S. branches and agencies 
of foreign banks reported having eased standards fo r C&I loans, though about 90 percent reported 
that their standards remained basically unchange d.  About 15 percent of foreign respondents, on 
net, reported narrower spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds and lower premiums charged 
on riskier loans.  Like the domestic banks, each of the five foreign banks that reported easing 
standards or terms cited more aggressive compe tition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the 
most important reason for having done so.  Only about 5 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported a decrease in demand for C&I loans. 
Special Question on Commercial and Industrial Lending  
The October survey
 included a special questi on on C&I lending, motivated by the significant 
decline in C&I loans outstanding over the first eight months of 2009.  The question focused on 
the possible sources of the contraction in C&I le nding, and it complements a special question in 
the July survey that asked banks to rank the relative importance of va rious supply and demand 
factors in explaining the decline in C&I loans.  Domestic respondents to the July survey predominantly cited demand factors, including lo wer loan demand from creditworthy borrowers 
because their funding needs had declined, followed by a deterioration in the credit quality of potential borrowers. 
Respondents to the October survey indicated th at decreased originations of term loans and 
reduced draws on revolving credit lines were gene rally more important sources of declines than 
paydowns of outstanding C&I loan balances.  More specifically, on a weighted basis, about 
40 percent and 30 percent of banks, respectively, reported that decreased originations of term 
loans and decreased draws on revolving credit lines we re ‚Äúvery‚Äù important sources of the decline 
in C&I loans this year.
3  About 15 percent of banks reported  that paydowns of previous draws on 
revolving credit lines were a ‚Äúvery‚Äù important sour ce of the decline.  Respondents also pointed to 
increased prepayments of term loans, paydowns of  bridge loans, and increased loan write-downs 
as either ‚Äúvery‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù important sources of the decline in C&I loans this year.  In 
contrast, relatively few domestic banks, on a we ighted basis, reported that increased sales or 
syndications of outstanding loans and increased incidence of term loans that matured and were 
not rolled over or extended were important factors.   Among the foreign respondents that indicated that  C&I lending had declined at their banks this 
year, about 50 percent, on a weighted basis, repor ted that decreased origination of term loans was 
a ‚Äúvery‚Äù important source of the decline.
4  In weighted terms, about 30 percent and 15 percent of 
                                                      
3 Data from commercial bank Call Reports were used to weight individual responses by the amount of 
C&I loans booked in domestic offices outstanding at the end of the second quarter.  The pattern of 
responses was similar on an unweighted basis.

 foreign banks, respectively, also reported paydowns  of bridge loans and paydowns of draws on 
revolving credit lines as being ‚Äúvery‚Äù important.  More than one-half of the respondents, on a 
weighted basis, also reported an increased inci dence of term loans not being rolled over or 
extended, and increased write-downs as ‚Äúvery‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù important sources of the decline in 
C&I loans.   
Questions on commercial real estate lending.   About 35 percent of domestic respondents 
reported tightening standards on CRE loans in the la test survey, a slightly smaller fraction than 
the 45 percent that reported having done so in July.  The net percentage of respondents that 
reported weaker demand for CRE loans remained high by historical standards at about 45 percent, 
but this fraction dropped almost 20 percentage points relative to July.  About 20 percent of 
foreign respondents, on net, reported tighter cr edit standards and weaker demand for CRE loans, 
down somewhat from the July survey. 
Special Question on Commercial Real Estate Lending  
The October survey included a special question on the status of CRE loans on banks‚Äô books that, 
at the beginning of 2009, were scheduled to mature by September of this year.  The question 
focused on construction and land development loans and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential 
real estate.  Among the domestic respondents that reported possessing such maturing CRE loans, about 85 percent, on a weighted basis, reported that they had extended more than one-fourth of them.
5  In contrast, weighted fractions of only ab out 15 percent and 25 percent of domestic banks 
reported that they had refinanced more than  one-fourth of maturi ng construction and land 
development loans and maturing loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate, respectively.  In general, large banks tended to extend more of their maturing CRE loans than 
small banks. 
Lending to Households 
Questions on residential real estate lending.  About 25 percent of banks, on net, reported in the 
latest survey that they had tightened standards on prime residential real estate loans over the past 
three months.  This figure is slightly higher than in the July survey but is still significantly below 
the peak of about 75 percent that was reported in  July 2008.  For the third consecutive quarter, 
banks reported that demand for prime residential real estate loans strengthened on net.  About 
30 percent of banks reported tightening standa rds on nontraditional mortgage loans, which 
represents a 15 percentage point decline in ne t tightening from the July survey.  Only about

 The net percentage of respondents that tightened  standards on revolving home equity lines of 
credit was about 30 percent, roughly the same as in the previous survey.  A net fraction of 
30 percent of banks reported weaker demand for ho me equity lines of credit, compared with 
about 15 percent in the previous survey.   
Question on consumer lending.  About 15 percent of respondents reported tightening standards 
for credit card loans to i
ndividuals or households , down from the 35 percent that reported doing 
so in the previous survey and the smallest net percentage reported since April 2008.  Sizable net 
fractions of banks‚Äîbetween 30 and 40 percent‚Äîcontinued to report a tightening of various terms and conditions on credit card loans,  including credit limits, interest rate spreads, minimum 
required credit scores, and willingness to grant loans to customers who do not meet credit-scoring thresholds.    
About 15 percent of banks, on net, reported ha ving tightened standards on consumer loans other 
than credit card loans, down from the 35 percent that reported having done so in the previous 
survey and the smallest net percentage of tight ening recorded since January 2008.  With the 
exception of interest rate spreads, which nearly  35 percent of banks reported having widened, 
reports of tighter terms on other consum er loans were also less widespread. 
For consumer loans of all types, 25 percent of  banks reported weaker demand, roughly the same 
as in the July survey.  
Special Question on the Credit CARD Act of 2009  
The October survey included a special question on banks‚Äô expectations with regard to the effects 
of the Credit CARD Act of 2009.  Of the banks that make credit card loans, 75 percent did not 
expect to be compliant with the provisions of th e legislation until February 2010, when most of 
the provisions will go into effect, while the rest we re either already compliant or expected to be 
compliant by the end of this year.  Weighted by credit card loans booked in domestic offices, 
about 90 percent did not expect to be in compliance until February 2010.
6  
As a result of the act, banks reported that they e xpect to tighten (or have already tightened) many 
terms on credit card loans for both prime and no nprime borrowers, although small fractions of 
banks reported, on net, that th ey expected to lengthen grace periods for prime borrowers and 
decrease penalty fees for both prime and nonprime borrowers.  The decrease in penalty fees is 
consistent with the provisions of the legislati on that restrict the conditions under which banks 
may impose such fees.  When responses are wei ghted, significantly larger fractions of banks 
                                                      
6 Data from commercial bank Call Reports were used to weight individual responses by the amount of 
credit card loans booked in domestic offices outsta nding at the end of the s econd quarter for all the 
commercial bank subsidiaries within a given parent ho lding company.  Many credit card loans made at the 
commercial banks in the sample are booked at various other commercial bank subsidiaries within the parent 
holding company.

 reported easing penalty fees for both prime and nonprime borrowers.  
For both prime and nonprime borrowers, majorities of respondents expected to increase interest 
rate spreads, r
aise minimum required credit scores, reduce credit limits, and reduce the extent to 
which loans will be granted to customers w ho do not meet credit-scoring thresholds.  
Expectations for considerable degrees of tight ening were more common for loans to nonprime 
borrowers.  On a weighted basis, substantial majorities of respondents, on net, expected to increase interest rate spreads, raise minimum required credit scores, and reduce credit limits. 
The survey also included two questions on inter est rate practices for credit card loans. A net 
fraction of about 35 percent of banks expected to  increase the use of risk-based pricing.  A similar 
fraction of banks expected to increase the use of variable interest rates and decrease the use of 
fixed interest rates, but when weighted by credit card loans outstanding, this fraction is about 
75 percent. 
Questions on existing credit lines.  As in the July survey, sizable net fractions of domestic 
respondents reported decreasing the sizes of credit lines for existing customers on most types of 
accounts.  For certain loan categories, such  as home equity lines of credit, commercial 
construction lines of credit, and lines of credit fo r financial firms, the net percentages of banks 
reporting such adjustments increased.  As in the July survey, considerable net fracti ons of foreign respondents reported decreasing the 
sizes of credit lines for existing customers on C& I credit lines, commercial construction lines of 
credit, and lines of credit to financial firms.  Ne vertheless, the net percentages of foreign banks 
reporting such changes edged down from their levels in the July survey.

U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services  
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $30.7 billion in August, from 
$31.9 billion in July, the result of a small increase in exports and a decrease in imports.  
 
 
 
T
he value of exports of goods and services moved up 0.2 percent in August, following a 
robust 2.5 percent gain  in July.  The August increase was primarily accounted for by an 
increase in exports of services, with exports of goods exhibiting only a very m ild 
increase.  Among major categories, exports of aircraft showed a marked decline, with exports of computers and consumer goods recording more modest decreases.  In contrast, 
exports of automotive products and industrial supplies showed noteworthy increas es.  
Higher automotive exports likely reflected the continuing recovery in U.S. automakers‚Äô production, while the increase in exports of industrial supplies reflected higher prices.   
IV-2

 The average value of exports in July and August surged 19.2 percent at an annual rate, 
the
 first quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2008.  With the exception of aircraft, 
all major categories of exports rose .  About two thirds of the overall gain  was accounted 
for by significant jumps in exports of automotive products and industrial supplies, with the increase in the latter partly reflecting higher prices.  
The value of imports of goods and services decreased 0.6 percent in August, after rebounding strongly in June and July.  The August decrease was led by a decline in the value of oil imports, which wholly reflected lower volumes, as prices moved up.  Imports of aircraft and consumer goods a lso recorded notable decreases.  I n contrast, imports of 
machinery, automotive products, and industrial supplies increased significantly.  As with exports, the increase in automotive imports continued to reflect, in part, a recovery in North American auto production, while the increase in imports of industrial supplies reflected higher prices.  
The average value of imports in July and August rose 26.6 percent at an annual rate, interrupting a string of three consecutive quarterly declines .  Nearly all major categories 
rose.  Imports of automotive products and oil recorded the largest increases, although the 
increase in the v alue of oil imports reflected  higher prices, as volumes remained 
essentially flat .  Imports of computers, machinery, industrial supplies, and services 
showed somewhat more moderate increases, while imports of aircraft registered a small decrease.  
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports .  
Prices for imported core goods rose 0.7 percent in September, the 
largest increase since July 2008.  The increase largely reflected higher prices of material -
intensive goods, and in pa rticular, prices for non -fuel industrial supplies.  Prices for 
finished goods were essentially flat across all major subcategories . 
I
n the third quarter, core import prices, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS),  increased 2¬º percent at an annual rate, primarily due to a more than 7 percent 
increase in prices of material intensive goods.  Prices of finished goods increased a 
modest ¬º percent, as lower prices for consumer goods largely offset higher prices for automotive products and capital goods. 
IV-5 
 
IV-6 
 
IV-7 
Oil.  Following a 1.6 percent increase in August,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics price 
index of imported oil was flat in  September, increasing only 0.1 percent.  The spot price 
of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged  just above $69 per barrel  in 
September , not materially different from the previous month‚Äôs average price.  In recent 
weeks , however, spot WTI has increased sharply, closing most recently on October 27 at 
$79.55 per barrel.  The upward movement in oil prices is surprisin g, although some 
analysts have pointed to a more positive assessment of global growth prospects as well as 
U.S. data pointing to a more rapid pace of inventory drawdown than had previously been 
expected.  
 
Exports.  Cor
e exports prices fell 0.4 percent in September  following a 0.8 percent 
increase in August .  The lower September prices primarily reflected a decline in the 
prices of exported agricultural products .  Prices  for finished goods were flat. 
 
In the
 third quarter, core export prices on a BLS basis increased 3¬æ percent at an annual 
rate.  An 11¬Ω percent increase in prices for industrial supplies contributed to the increase.  
Prices for exports of finished goods rose almost 2 percent, led by hi gher prices for 
consumer goods.  
 
U.S. International Financ ial Transactions 
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial transactions which indicate the recent trend of portfolio reallocations toward riskier securities continued  in August.  Private foreign investors sold U.S. Treasury securities 
and purchased U.S. equities, and U.S. investors purchased a sizable amount of foreign equities.  Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities remained strong in August, although purchases were below the levels recorded at  the height of the financial 
crisis.  
 
Fore
ign official inflows in August (see line 1 of the table ‚ÄúSummary of U.S. International 
Transactions‚Äù; see also the figure ‚ÄúForeign Official Financial Inflows through August 2009‚Äù) eased a bit to $21 billion.   
 
.  More recent custody data from the FRBNY 
sugg
est that the pace of foreign official inflows into Treasury securities accelerated in 
September and October, consistent with reports of greater intervention activity by foreign monetary authorities.   
  

IV-8 
 
 
 Foreign private demand for U.S. securities remained weak in August, as private 
for
eigners on  net sold $16 billion in U.S. securities (line 4 of the table and the middle-
right panel of the figure ‚ÄúPrivate Securities Flows through August 2009‚Äù).  Foreign private investors purchased modest amounts of agency debt (line 4b) and corporate stocks (line 4d), but continued to sell U.S. corporate debt (line 4c).  In the years prior to the financial crisis, foreign investors had typically purchased a significant percentage of new issues of U.S. corporate debt.  Despite the pick-up in issuance of U.S. corporate debt in 2009, however, foreign investors have on net sold a significant amount of corporate bonds.  This lack of interest may reflect the larger share of recent issuance accounted for by nonfinancial firms, as foreign investors have tended to favor debt issued by financial firms.  
Financial outflows associated with U.S. investors‚Äô net purchases of foreign securities slowed in August (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure ‚ÄúPrivate Securities Flows 
through August 2009‚Äù).  Strong net purchases of foreign stocks by U.S. investors were 
offset by net sales of foreign bonds.   
Central banks‚Äô outstanding drawings on the Federal Reserve swap lines  declined further 
to $33 billion as of October 23, which reflects further normalization of the funding 
markets.   The official inflows associated with the unwinding of these swaps are included 
in line 2.  There were small net inflows associated with n et private bank borrowing  in 
August (line 3).

 Foreign Financial Markets 
The trade -weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign 
currencies has depreciated slightly on net since the September Greenbook.  Some further 
unwinding of the crisis-induced shift toward the dollar due to continued improvements in funding conditions and global economic outlook was subsequently reversed after the weaker -than-expected U.S. consumer confidence data revived concerns over the pace of 
an economic rebound.  T he dollar depreciated 1 percent on balance against the euro a nd 
the Canadian dollar and 6 percent against the Australian dollar, but appreciated 1 percent against the yen and sterling.  Dollar weakness against the euro prompted President Trichet of the European Central Bank (ECB) to call for a strong dollar.  D espite 
interventions by several Asian and Latin American central banks to stem appreciation of their currencies, t he exchange value of the dollar against the other important trading 
partners of the United States has decreased slightly, with the dollar down 4 and 5 percent against the Brazilian real and Russian ruble, respectively, and 2 percent against the 
Korean won. 
Expected policy rates (from OIS forwards) 12 months hence rose broadly in most major 
industrial economies on the improved foreign economic outlook.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) became the first central bank among G -20 countries to hike rates since 
August 2008, raising its policy rate 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.  Further tightening by the RBA is expected in November and December.  Norge s Bank also raised its policy rate 
25 basis points to 1.5 percent.  Expected policy rates have also risen in other major foreign industrial economies, despite indications that central banks will continue to remain accommodative for some time.  T he ECB left  its policy rate unchanged at 1 
percent, as expected.  Its second 12-month long- term refinancing operation was again 
conducted at a fixed rate of 1 percent, which temporarily dampened market expectations that the ECB will begin to hike rates within the nex t year .  The Bank of Canada kept its 
key policy rate unchanged and reiterated its intention to maintain its stance through mid -
2010.  The Bank of England kept its policy rate and its asset purchase program unchanged, as expected.  Although the October Mone tary Policy Committee minutes 
were seen by participants as suggesting earlier rate increases than had been previously expected, as well as a diminished likelihood for an increase in asset purchases, the weaker -than-expected Q3 GDP data pared back such expe ctations.   
Ten-year sovereign yields were little changed in Europe and increased 8 and 12 basis 
points in Japan and Canada, respectively.  Headline stock indexes fluctuated in a narrow range in most major industrial economies.  Equity prices in most major emerging market 
IV-13 
  economies rose 4 to 16 percent, but in China and South Korea they were little changed. 
C
DS spreads on emerging market sovereign debt continued to decline.

 Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies  
Incoming indicators for the third quarter have been positive, on balance, across the 
advanced foreign economies with the notable exception of the United Kingdom, where GDP unexpectedly contracted.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) r ose solidly in the 
third quarter, reaching levels consistent with a stabilization or moderate expansion of output, and flash PMIs continued to rise in the euro area in October.  Consumption spending, with the help of fiscal stimulus in many cases, appears to have risen over the third quarter.  Surveys suggest that consumer confidence also continued to climb, although it remains below pre-recession levels, in part because households remain concerned over labor market conditions.  Trade volumes are up from their early- year 
lows, and in some countries, the rebound in trade has been accompanied by an increase in production.  The production bounce has been especially pronounced in Japan.  
Twelve -month consumer price inflation stayed negative in all major economies, with the  
exception of the United Kingdom, where it was 1.1 percent in September.  The European 
Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the Bank of England (BOE) kept policy rates on hold and continued implementing their asset-purchase programs, but BOJ officials signaled an intention to let some credit-easing programs expire at the end of the 
year. 
IV-20 
 
 
IV-21 
 
 
  
Inc
oming data  for Japan  suggest that external demand remained the main driver of the 
recovery in the third quarter.  Although both imports and exports remain well below 2008 
levels , international trade surged in the third quarter with real exports and real imports 
rising at annual rates of 52  percent and 39 percent, respectively .  Domestic demand also 
improved in the third quarter.  With the help of government stimulus, consumption, which rose 3 percent in the second quarter, appears to have continued to rise in the third quarter.  Consumer confidence has risen back to levels last seen in the fourth quarter of 2007.   
Industrial production rose in August for the sixth consecutive month, and machinery 
orders appear  to have stabilized over the summer, suggesting that private investment 
might have leveled out after contracting sharply over the past year.  Recent indicators of business confidence, including the BOJ‚Äôs Tankan index, show that pe ssimism among 
Japanese fir ms eased somewhat  in the third quarter, although business sentiment remains 
near record lows.  
The overall good news for the Japanese economy is moderated somewhat by data from the labor and housing markets.  Despite the recent downtick in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in August from 5.7 percent in July, the more reliable ratio of job openings to  
applicants (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) held at a 46 -year record low in August.  The housing 
IV-22 
 
 market also remains depressed, with h ous ing starts dropping more than 9 percent in 
August from the previous month to a new series low.   
On the consumer price front, 12-month headline inflation was unchanged in August at 
negative 2.2 percen t, a record low.  Energy prices continued to put downward pressure on 
inflation, but they were not solely to blame.  Inflation excluding food and energy prices fell 0.9 percent over the 12 months ending in August.  
The BOJ held its target for the overnight call rate at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting 
period but signaled that it intends to let some of its credit- easing programs expire at the 
end of the year, citing improved conditions in the markets for commercial paper and corporate bonds.  Newly appoint ed Prime Minister Hatoyama has promised to transform 
the economy into one where growth is generated by domestic spending rather than by exports alone.  In October, the administration unveiled a set of emergency measures 
intended to create 100,000 jobs by t he end of the fiscal year.  The stimulus package 
focuses on easing regulatory hurdles and helping job-seekers find work in the agricultural 
and environmental sectors. 
IV-23 
 
 
IV-24 
 
 
 
 On ba
lance, recent indicators for the euro area  suggest a further improvement in 
economic conditions.  Measures of economic sentiment continued to improve and flash 
PMIs rose further in October , generally indicating expansion.  Industrial production, 
excluding construction, has been particularly  stron g, increasing 1  percent in August, the 
fourth consecutive monthly increase.  New industrial orders grew 2.0 percent in August.  On a less positive note, in August, real retail sales declined 0.2 percent, and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.6 percent.  Exports fell about 6 percent in August, led by an almost 9  percent decline in manufactured products.  In addition, the pace of car 
registrations slowed from more than 12 percent in the second quarter to 1.4 percent in the 
third, reflecting the unwinding of schemes to support car sales. 
Developments of credit to the nonfinancial sector have been mixed, with rising credit to 
the household sector and falling credit to nonfinancial corporations.  In September, loans 
to nonfinancial corporations fell 0.2 percent from the previous month, the fifth 
consecutive monthly decline.  Loans to households added to recent gains, increasing 0.3 percent from the previous month.  
IV-25 
 Twelve - month euro- area inflation was negative 0.3  percent  in September, following 
negative 0.2 percent in August.  The downturn in energy prices (which fel l 11 percent in 
September  from a year earlier) has been an important factor in the decline of inflation.  
Excluding food and energy, September  inflation was 1.2 percent.   
The Governing Council of the ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 
1 percent at its October 8 meeting.  Since the ECB‚Äôs record liquidity injection of ‚Ç¨442 billion in one-year funds in June, the overnight EONIA rate has tended to be just above the 0.25 percent rate on the ECB‚Äôs deposit facility.  The second one-year operation on September 30 elicited less interest, with allotments totaling ‚Ç¨75  billion.  The ECB has 
continued to implement plans to buy ‚Ç¨60 billion worth of covered bonds and had purchased about ‚Ç¨20 billion by late October.   
IV-26 
 
IV-27 
 
 
 
 In the United Kingdom , real GDP contracted 1.6 percent in the third quarter according to 
the preliminary estimate, bringing the cumulative drop since the beginning of the 
recession to 6.0 percent.  The output of services industries fell 1.1 percent despite strong performance from retail sales during the quarter.  The output of manufacturing and construction industries is estimated to have fallen 0.9 percent and  4.7 percent, 
respectively.  
The m 
oderation in the pace of GDP contraction was accompanied by tentative signs of 
stabilization in the labor market.  The L abor Force Survey measure of the unemployment 
rate was unchanged at 7.9 percent in the three months to August.  Short- term 
unemployment (durations 0 to 6 months) fell somewhat relative to the previous three months.  A similarly -sized increase in unemployment at longer durations suggests that 
finding new employment remains difficult.  Expenditures on machinery, equipment, and infrastructure appear especially weak.  According to the Bank of England (BOE) Agents‚Äô Summary of Business Conditions, investment intentions of manufacturing and services firms remained depressed in September.  New construction orders fell back in August. 
Measures of credit to the nonfinancial sector continue to be weak.  Bank lending to 
private nonfinancial corporations fell 3.8 percen t in the 12 months to August, a pace 
approaching the low observed in the wake of the early 1990s recession.  Net lending secured by dwellings was near its recent trough in August despite some improvement in 
IV-28 
 
 
 house purchases and prices since the beginning of the year.  House prices fell close to 
20 pe
rcent between late summer 2007 and early spring 2009 but have since risen around 
6 percent.  Housing equity withdrawal as a share of households‚Äô post-tax disposable income was negative 3  percent in the second quarter, compared with about 5 percent in 
2007. 
Price pressure remains subdued.  H eadline inflation  tumbled to 1.1 percent in September 
on a 12-month basis, its lowest reading since June 2003, as sharp increases in utility 
prices last year dropped out of the equation.  Producer input prices fell 6.5 percent over 
the same period , up from double- digit declines at the beginning of the summer .  In 
contrast, in August, the 12- month change in average weekly earnings  excluding bonuses 
posted its first increase in a year.  
At its October meeting, the BOE left its policy rate unchanged and maintained its current 
asset -purchase programs.  As of October 22, the BOE had acquired ¬£170.6 billion in 
assets through the creation of bank reserves, the vast majority of which (¬£168.6 billion) 
were gilts.  The central bank is expected to complete its ¬£175 billion asset- purchase 
program by the end of the month and decide on a further extension at the November meeting of its monetary policy committee.  
IV-29 
 
 
IV-30 
 
 
 
 Can
adian  indicators for the third quarter are positive, on balance.  After faltering early in 
the year, trade volumes have rebounded.  Over the three months ending in August, 
exports and imports increased at annual rates of 23  percent and 43 percent, respectively.  
Both exports and imports were supported by a surge in automotive trade.  Machinery and equipment imports were also up sharply.  Likely reflecting, in part, the strength in international trade, m anufacturing shipments rose solidly.  The Canadian housing market 
is also rebounding forcefully.  Total housing starts rose more than 15 percent, not at an annual rate, in the third quarter.  Monthly GDP declined negligibly in July.
 
Ca
nadian labor-market conditions showed modest improvement.  Total employment 
declined slightly in the third quarter as a whole, but rose modestly in both August and September.  The September gain was driven by a sharp increase in full -time employment; 
prior to the September release, almost all of the stability in Canadian employment was attributable to increases in part -time work.  With the increase in full- time employment, 
hours worked rose 1.6 percent in September, the first increase in three months.  The unemployment rate fell 0.3  percentage point to 8.4 percent , the first monthly decline 
since the beginning of the labor-market downturn in the fall of 2008. 
Consumer prices fell 0.9 percent in the 12 months ending in September.  The decrease 
was due primarily  to a decline in energy prices .  Inflation excluding food and energy was 
0.9 percent, near its lowest level of the past several years.   
IV-31 
The Ban k of Canada kept its policy rate at 0.25 percent and has reiterated its intention, 
conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until at least the end of 
the second quarter of 2010.
IV-32

 Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Data since the September Greenbook indicate that the economic recovery in the emerging 
market economies continued over the third quarter.  Domestic demand appears to be playing an important role in supporting recovery across Asia and parts of South America.  China‚Äôs economy continued to roar ahead, supported by accommodative policies, and growth wa s surprisingly strong in Korea and Singapore.  Ample government credit has 
supported demand in Brazil.  The Mexican economy showed signs of a revival in activity after a year of output contraction.  Inflation, although declining, remains a concern in Mexico and Brazil, but inflation pressures appear to be contained in Asia with the major exception of India.  Imports have generally continued to rise and there are firmer signs of export growth.   
In China , the staff estimates that real GDP increased 9.8 percent at an annual rate in the 
third quarter, as activity continued to be supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus.  (The 
official, headline four-quarter growth rate was 8.9 percent.)  In September, industrial production was nearly 12 percent above its year- earlier level, and the official PMI 
reading remained solidly in the expansionary range.  Real retail sales growth remained strong, and fixed-asset investment was up more than 33 percent from September of last year.  Robust domestic demand has contributed to rising imports, which are now within 10 percent of their pre-crisis peak.  Exports have also increased, but in September, they remained 17 percent below their year- earlier levels.  
In October, Premier Wen Jiabao explicitly stated that the recovery of the Chinese economy is on firm ground.  He stressed that in the coming months authorities will focus on striking the appropriate balance between maintaining growth, restructuring the economy, and guarding against inflation.  As in recent months, loan growth in September 
was around 1 percent on a month-over-month basis, considerably down from the pace in the first half of the year, but a level still supportive of economic growth; the value of outstanding loans was 34 percent higher than a year ago.  Food prices moved higher in the third quarter, pushing quarterly headline inflation up to 1.2 percent at an annual rate, whereas inflation measured on a four-quarter basis remained negative.  
IV-34 
 
 
 
  
      In I
ndia , recent indicators point to solid growth in the third quarter.  The pace of 
recovery of the manufacturing sector has been surprisingly swift, mostly driven by a sharp rise in the demand for investment goods and consumer durables, particularly autos.  The merchandise trade deficit, which had narrowed sharply during the crisis, has widened during the past few months as the domestic-demand-led recovery has caused imports to grow faster than exports. However, weak credit demand raises some concerns t hat the 
recovery may prove to be tenuous. 
Consumer price inflation spiked in July and August to just under 11 percent on a 
12-month basis, while wholesale price inflation, which is more closely followed in India, turned positive in September after several months of falling prices.  The monsoon season was one of the driest in decades and put upward pressure on food prices in recent months.  In late October, the central bank removed the extraordinary liquidity measures that had been provided during the crisis, while leaving its key policy rates unchanged.

12.3 percent, boosted by a sharp moderation in inventory drawdown.1  Consum
ption and 
fixed investment decelerated from the second quarter.  Preliminary data indicate that 
growth remained at a double-digit level in Singapore, reflecting strong exports and stabilizing domestic demand.  The trade surpluses in Singapore, Korea , and Taiwan ‚Äî
which had risen sharply during the crisis because imports collapsed more sharply than exports‚Äînarrowed again in the third quarter as brisk domestic demand growth led imports to bounce back faster than exports. 
Inflation has risen a little fro m low or negative rates in the region.  Inflationary pressures 
have not presented a threat in the near term, but the reduced degree of economic slack has 
led observers to believe that central banks in the region, particularly Korea, will tighten monetary p olicy in coming months.  Policymakers have also expressed concerns about 
potential asset bubbles and to date have addressed these concerns with prudential 
measures.

2 The ASEAN -4 are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.                                                   In the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN -4), economic recovery  
continued into the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous quarter.2  
Wit
hin the region, the recovery of Thailand‚Äôs economy appears the most tenuous.  
Domestic demand appears to be supporting growth in Indonesia.  In contrast, domestic demand was weak in Thailand as well as the Philippines, where remittances declined over the July-August period.  In Thailand and Malaysia, industrial production fell in August after several months of growth, and in each case, was about 12 percent below the peaks attained in early 2008.  Trade balances in the region were generally flat or deteriorated slightly, as the pace of recovery in imports exceeded the pace of recovery in exports.  
Consumer prices increased on a monthly basis in August and September.  As a result, on a 12-month basis, inflation in Indonesia and the Philippines edged up, and in Thailand 
and Malaysia became less negative.  With inflation subdued, central banks maintained their policy rates unchanged.

 In Mexico , data suggest that activity began to revive in the third quarter following four 
quarters of decline in real GDP.  Industrial production was up, on balance, over the July-
August period, boosted by auto production for the export market.  Accordingly, overal l 
exports were up in the third quarter through August.  In September, the manufacturing PMI continued to climb and moved into the expansion range.  Although business confidence has picked up, consumer confidence remained weak.   
Weak domestic activity has  helped mitigate inflationary pressures in recent months, 
bringing 12-month headline and core inflation down to just below 5 percent.  However, 
inflation remains above the 2 to 4 percent inflation target range.  Balancing concerns about inflation against t he still-fragile state of the economy, the Bank of Mexico kept its 
policy rate on hold at its mid -October meeting.  In early September, the Calderon 
government introduced a bill that envisions far-reaching reforms to public finances.  However, the lower house unexpectedly watered down the tax provisions considerably, 
fueling concern that Mexico‚Äôs government would continue to be heavily dependent on oil 
revenues amid a trend of declining oil production.  That development fueled speculation that Mexico‚Äôs cred it risk rating  will be reduced.  In response, the Senate, which had been 
expected to accept the lower house provisions, is now expected to review the bill and has until the end of October to decide on the tax provisions.

 In Brazil , dat a releases indicate that the recovery continued in the third quarter, 
supported by higher commodity prices and expansionary fiscal policies.  The manufacturing PMI continued to climb through September and remained in the range indicating expansion.  Industrial production climbed further through August, but was still 10 percent below its September 2008 peak.  Production was supported by strong domestic demand, particularly for autos and appliances, which have been boosted by temporary government tax incentives.  Domestic demand also continued to be supported by rapid loan growth , particularly government-directed credit.  The trade surplus narrowed in the 
third quarter, as exports expanded at a slower pace than imports.   
Headline and core inflation both fell in September, coming in at 4.3 percent and 
5 percent, respectively, on a 12-month basis.  At its October 21 meeting, the central bank of Brazil held its policy rate at 8¬æ  percent, where it has been since last July.  However, 
there has been considerable speculation in recent weeks that soon the central bank will 
raise reserve requirements to tighten credit conditions and that the central bank will raise 
its policy rate in early 2010. 
Strong net capital inflows continued through late October, fueling upward pressures on 
the currency.  In late October, as a result of official purchases of foreign exchange to 
stem the appreciation of the real , international reserves reached a record high of 
$230 bi
llion.  The government imposed a 2-percent tax on portfolio capital inflows to 
stem currency appreciation.  Analysts have questioned how effective the tax will be in the longer term in curbing capital inflows and whether the move will hinder financial sector development.

                     In Russia , economic activity began to rebound in the third quarter following three 
quarters of decline.  Industrial production was up 22 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Retail sales were flat in the third quarter, but consumer confidence has shown improvement in recent months.  The unemployment rate ticked down in September, to a seasonally -adjusted 8 percent, from 9 percent in May. Consumer prices rose just 
0.3 percent in September bringing headline consumer price inflation down to 10.7 percent on a 12-month basis, the lowest in two years.  Higher oil prices have supported a strong ruble.  The central bank of Russia has allowed some currency appreciation but also has been accumulating reserves over the past few months.
