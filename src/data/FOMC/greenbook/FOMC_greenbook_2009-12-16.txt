 Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. The recovery in economic activity appear s to be gaining momentum.  Consumer 
spending posted a robust gain in October, a nd sales of  light vehi cles climbed again in 
November.  Sales of both new and existing hom es also registered solid increases in 
October, and inventories of unsold new homes fell further.  Although spending on 
nonresidential structures conti nued to contract sharply in Oc tober, shipments of capital 
goods have leveled off, on balance, in recent months.  At the same time, industrial production has continued to rebound from the low level reached earlier in the year.  
Moreover, the decline in private payroll employment in November was the smallest since the start of the recession, a nd the unemployment rate ticked down.  Nonetheless, the 
jobless rate and other estimates of slack in resource utilization remained substantial in 
recent months, and consumer sentiment indexe s were still at low levels.  Meanwhile, a 
sharp rise in energy prices pushed top-line inflation higher, even as the rise in core 
consumer prices remained subdued.   
Labor Market Developments  
The pace of job loss has slowed considerably in recent months relativ e to the steep drops 
that occurred in the first ha lf of the year.  Private nonfar m payroll employment declined 
an estimated 18,000 in November after three mo nths in which declines averaged about 
140,000 per month.  Moreover, the recent improve ment in the employment situation was 
widespread across most industries.  Of particular note, the temporary help services 
industry—often considered a bellwether of developments in the labor market—added nearly 40,000 jobs per month during the past three months.  Employers also appear to 
have begun lengthening workweeks, which can be  a precursor to a pickup in hiring.  The 
average workweek for production and nonsupe rvisory workers rose 0.2 hour to  
33.2 hours in November, and aggregate hours worked for this group increased 0.6 percent, the first significant increase since the recession began. 
As with the payroll data, key measures of labor market slack from the household survey 
have continued to weaken over the past several months, on balance, but more gradually 
than earlier in the year.  Between June a nd November, the unemployment rate moved up 
½ percentage point to 10 per cent after having risen more than 2 percen tage points in the 
first half of the year.   Likewise, the fract ion of workers working part time for economic 
reasons has increased only slightly in the s econd half of the year.  However, the labor 
force participation rate, which held stea dy earlier in the recession, has moved down 
steeply since the spring.

 The slower rise in the unemployment rate since midyear primarily reflects a moderation 
in layoffs rather than an improvement in hiring.  Both initial claims for unemployment insurance and the number of new job losers have fallen over the past several months.  The rate of layoffs and discharges from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey has 
also moved down from its highs la st winter, but its progress has been more erratic.      
In contrast, hiring conditions remain wea k.  Measures of job openings have been 
basically unchanged since April,  and indicators of both actua l and planned hiring are still 
near the depressed levels seen at the start of the year.  As a result, the average length of 
ongoing unemployment spells has risen steeply, and joblessness has become increasingly 
concentrated among those out of work for mo re than 26 weeks.  Rising unemployment 
duration is also reflected in the increasing share of tota l claimants for unemployment 
insurance who are receiving extended or emergency benefits.  Indeed, even as the number of persons receiving unemployment insurance be nefits through regular state programs has 
been declining for some time, the total num ber of individuals r eceiving unemployment 
insurance—including extended and emergency benefits—only recently appears to have 
leveled off. 
Other indicators of the labor market have c ontinued to deteriorate, including the number 
of firms reporting hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey and individuals’ perceptions 
of current job availability from the Conf erence Board Survey.  However, households’ 
expectations of future labor market conditi ons have changed little, on net, in recent 
months and remain well above the lo w point reached earlier this year.

 The staff estimates that output per hour of a ll persons in the nonfarm business sector rose 
at an annual rate of 7.3 percen t in the third quarter—as hours declined sharply and output 
expanded—following a similarly large increase in the second quarter.  Over the four 
quarters ending in the third quarter of this year, labor productivity is  estimated to have 
increased 3.8 percent. 
Industrial Production 
Industrial production (IP) edged up in October af ter increasing at an annual rate of 
5.6 percent in the third quarter.  In Novemb er, data on production worker hours as well as 
the available data on physical output suggest th at IP rose solidly.  Since the June trough 
in IP, production gains have been widespread; indeed, in well over half of the individual 
series that make up the index, the level of production in October was higher than three 
months earlier.  Recent production gains have  reflected a surge in output for motor 
vehicles and parts (and the re sulting demand for intermediate  materials), a slowing pace 
of inventory liquidation elsewher e, and rising export demand.   
Despite the gains in production, the degree of  manufacturing slack remains considerable.  
Although the factory operating ra te in October, at 67.6 percent, was 2½ percentage points 
above its all-time low in June, it neverthele ss remained 1 percentage point below its 
previous low (reached in December 1982).  
After having moved up in September, the produc tion of light motor vehicles fell back to 
an annual rate of 6.8 million units in October and appears to have edged up in November.  
Although stocks of domestic lig ht vehicles expanded in both October and November, the 
recent increases in the pace of sales reduced days’ supply at the end of November to  
55 days, a level that is significantly below the industry target of about 65 days.  
Production schedules call for output to climb to an annual rate of 7.4 million units in 
December and then to remain at that  level in the first quarter of 2010.  
Industrial production in the high- tech sector edged up, on bala nce, over the three months 
through October as solid incr eases in semiconductor output outweighed the weakness in 
production of computers and co mmunication equipment.  However, recently released 
data on shipments of PCs and se rvers, which have not yet been incorporated in published 
IP, suggest that the production of mobile computers and servers jumped in the third 
quarter and that computer production is likely to be revised up.  In  contrast, production in 
the communications equipment segment of the industry has been wea k, partly reflecting a

 decline in the production of wi reless infrastructure equipment, which had surged earlier 
in the year.  Upstream, the solid gains in the production of semiconductors reflect some 
restocking after the enormous production dec lines early in the year as well as a 
bounceback in global chip demand.   
Looking ahead, comments from high-tech consultancies and manufacturers suggest that 
global high-tech demand for computers ha s continued to improve this quarter.1   In 
addition, orders and shipments of circuit boa rds—which are used in a wide variety of 
electronic products—have continued to m ove up, on balance.  Some semiconductor 
producers could find a further brisk pickup in demand difficult to meet because 
utilization rates at some lead ing-edge facilities have alrea dy rebounded to elevated levels 
and days’ supply has fallen substantially.  In fact, shortages of certa in types of memory 
chips have been reported recently.  The output of energy rose again in October.   Moreover, available data for November 
suggest that drilling activity moved up for a fourth consecutive m onth, and oil extraction 
rose for a fifth consecutive month.  The boost to both drilling and extraction activity was 
likely spurred by the rise in  oil prices this year. 
Outside of energy, transportati on, and high-tech industries, output was flat in October 
after increasing 4¼ percent at an  annual rate in the third qua rter.  Production of consumer 
goods moved up in October, as gains in nondurables more than offset decreases in 
durables.  In addition, materials output edged up.  By contrast, the output of construction 
supplies, business supplies, and business equipment each declined for a second consecutive month.   
The available indicators of near-term manufact uring activity, on net, suggest that factory 
output will expand further in the coming m onths.  The monthly diffusion index of new 
orders from the national ISM survey remained in a range that suggests solid increases in 
production, while the orders indexes from the regional surveys were broadly consistent 
with moderate gains in manufacturing output .  By contrast, the staff series on real 
adjusted durable goods orders declined in Oct ober relative to three months earlier.   
                                                 
1 However, because these sources anticipate that su stained demand from the business sector—the focus 
of U.S. computer production—will be slow to materi alize, the pickup in domestic output will likely be 
delayed.  Moreover, the eventual boost to domestic production from global demand is likely to be smaller 
than in recent years because Dell’ s recent change in business strate gy—shifting toward outsourcing 
production—implies greater import penetration in the U.S. computer market.  For example, Dell’s North Carolina PC production plant will completely shut down around the turn of the year.

 In the recent ISM Sem
iannual Economic Forecast, the diffusion index of capital spending 
plans jumped to a moderate level from its record low in the spring.  This reading is 
consistent with little change in capital spe nding in the manufacturing sector next year and 
with another sizable contraction in factory capacity.   
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending has continued to recover.   Real PCE climbed 0.4 percent in October 
following a solid increase in the third quart er.  Moreover, the gains in October were 
broad based:  Outlays for motor vehicles bounced back almost 9 percent after a sharp 
decline in September, spending on other goods rose 0.1 percent, and spending on services 
advanced 0.3 percent, th e largest monthly increase in more  than a year.   More recently, 
sales of new light vehicles rose an additiona l 500,000 units in November to an annual rate 
of 10.9 million units despite less generous cas h rebates and finance incentives this 
quarter.  Other indicators of spending in N ovember, including data on chain store sales 
and credit card transaction volumes, were mixed, but gene rally pointed to another 
increase in outlays. 
While spending has rebounded, the fundamentals of household demand have remained 
soft.  Although household net worth moved up in the third quarter, hous eholds have lost 
wealth equivalent to more than 1½ years of income over the past two years and are likely 
still adjusting th eir spending to that loss.  In addition, real labor compensation, which 
plunged in the first quarter, dec lined modestly, on net, over the second and third quarters, 
largely reflecting decreases in aggregate hours worked.2  In the current quarter, the 
available data suggest that a jump in energy prices has erased the modest gains in nominal labor income.  Nevertheless, disposab le income has been supported for most of 
the year by lower taxes and higher transfers.   With spending on the rise, the personal 
saving rate dropped back down to 4.4 percent in October but is still well above the 
average rate observed before the recession.  Meanwhile, credit conditions remain tight, 
and measures of consumer sentiment still suggest overall weakness.   
Housing 
Housing demand has continued to firm.  Sale s of existing single-family homes jumped  
                                                 
2 Since the last Greenbook, the BEA has revised up nominal compensation by $88 billion at an annual 
rate in the second quarter and by $111 billion at an an nual rate in the third quarter, on the basis of newly 
available data on unemployment insurance tax records for the second quarter.

II-1610 percent in October following a similar incr ease in September.  These huge increases 
probably reflect, in part, a grea ter supply of low-priced homes given the large number of 
transactions involving bank-ow ned and distressed properties.3  Regarding the market for 
new homes, sales agreements rose a solid 6 percent in October follo wing two months of 
little change.   
.  
The modest recovery in housing demand lik ely reflects improvements in the underlying 
fundamentals, particularly greater affordability  and the perception that house prices have 
bottomed out.  Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which have 
been very low by historical standards th roughout 2009, moved back below 5 percent in 
recent weeks.  House prices also have show n signs of firming.  Although the repeat-sales 
price index for existing singl e-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance edged down 
in September and October, the level in October stood 4 percent above its trough in 
March.  In addition, in the Reuters/University  of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the 
number of respondents who expect house pric es to increase over the next 12 months 
continued to exceed the number of res pondents who expect prices to decrease. 
Although the pace of sales is still modest, it  has been ample enough, given the slow pace 
of construction, to reduce the overhang of unsold new single-family houses.  The stock of 
unsold new homes dropped further in October and is now less than half of its peak in 
mid-2006; measured relative to the October pace of sales, the months’ supply of new 
homes has come down to 6¾ months, the lowest level in almost three years.  More broadly, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupancy (which includes both 
existing and completed new homes for sale ) has come down from its peak in 2008, 
although it is still high relati ve to pre-2006 levels.   
Despite further improvements in sales and i nventories, construction activity has held 
steady in recent months.  Single-family housing starts were essentially flat from June to 
October at an annual rate of around 500,000 units .  Adjusted permit issuance has also 
been roughly constant since June and was a b it below the rate of starts in October.   
 
 
 
 
                                                 
3Anecdotal reports suggest that the first-time homebuyer tax credit may also have provided some 
support to home sales this year.  However, this effect appears to have been relatively minor.  The National 
Association of Realtors reported that 47 percent of home purchases from July 2008 to June 2009 were made to first-time homebuyers, only somewhat higher than the average proportion of 40 percent in the past 
decade.  Moreover, the rise in the first-time home buyer share might also be due to improved housing 
affordability.

    However, the low level of inventories relative  to sales suggests that increases in single-
family construction are likely to resume in the near term.  In the much smaller 
multifamily sector—where tight credit condi tions have persisted and vacancies have 
remained elevated—starts plunged 35 percent in  October to their lo west level since the 
series began in 1959. 
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) is estimated to have edged up in the 
third quarter after falling sharply for more than a year.  The available indicators of 
spending on transportation equipment suggest  that outlays in this category have 
continued to rise.  However,  outside of transportation, E& S spending appears to have 
merely leveled off.  Indeed, orders and sh ipments of nondefense capital goods excluding 
aircraft were about unchanged, on balance, in September and October. 
Business purchases of motor vehicles have increased thus far in the fourth quarter.  Sales 
of light vehicles to fleet customers moved up, on balance, in October and November, and 
sales of medium and heavy trucks increased  in October.  Moreover, new orders for 
medium and heavy trucks jumped sharply in October:  With new environmental 
regulations on diesel engine s taking effect in January 2010, some customers likely 
accelerated their orders for new trucks, a move that may pull forward some sales to November and December from  early next year.   
Real spending on high-tech E&S rose moderately  in the third quarter and appears to be 
increasing at a subdued pace early in the fourth quarter.  Although shipments of 
communications equipment in October retraced so me of the declines seen in the prior two 
months, orders fell further.  In addition, no minal orders and shipments of computers and 
peripherals declined again in October.
4  Nonetheless, major producers of high-tech 
equipment, such as Cisco and Dell, have si nce reported signs of improvement in demand 
this quarter. 
Business investment in equipment other than transportation and high t ech fell a bit further 
in the third quarter after having dropped steep ly during the preceding three quarters.  In 
October, shipments of these capital goods, wh ich account for half of total E&S outlays, 
edged down, while new orders dropped markedl y, erasing the prior month’s gain in the 
                                              
4 A report from Dell suggests that demand for computers in October may have been held down 
somewhat by an unusual drop in orders in the two weeks prior to the release of Windows 7 on October 22.

 stock of unfilled orders.  The drop in orders  was fairly broad based, with noteworthy 
declines in bookings for construction, industr ial, and service machinery, as well as for 
electro-medical, measuring, and controlling devices. 
The fundamental determinants of investment  in E&S have improved somewhat recently, 
but, on balance, are consistent with only slugg ish gains in business outlays in the coming 
months.  On the positive side, the measure of the user cost of capital that we follow fell 
again in the third quarter and has now retraced the run-up that  occurred late last year.  
Likewise, spreads of corporate bonds over Treasury securities have decreased 
considerably from their extremely high levels at  the end of last year, likely reflecting less 
uncertainty and better assessments of future profitability.  Meanwhile, monthly surveys 
of business conditions, sentiment, and capital spending plans have recovered somewhat, but thus far only to levels suggestive of a m oderate rise in business spending.  And, as 
noted earlier, the diffusion index of capita l spending plans in the recent ISM semiannual 
report jumped to a moderate level from the historically low reading recorded in the spring.  However, business output remained 4 pe rcent below its year-earlier level, despite 
turning up in the third quarter.  In addition, the net share of small businesses reporting 
increased difficulty in obtaining credit was unchanged in the Nove mber NFIB survey and 
remained at a historically high level.   
Nonresidential Construction 
Conditions in the nonresidential construction se ctor generally remain bleak.  Real outlays 
on structures outside of the drilling and mini ng sector plunged at an annual rate of  
22 percent in the third quarter, and recent da ta on nominal expenditures point to further 
deterioration in October.  The weakness has been widespread across categories and likely 
reflects the drag from rising vacancy rate s, plunging property prices, and difficult 
financing conditions for new projects.  More over, the nonresidential construction industry 
continued to shed workers in November , and the most recent reading from the 
architectural billings index remained at levels consistent with further declines in 
spending.   
Following steep declines in the first half of  the year, real spending on drilling and mining 
structures increased at an annual rate of near ly 9 percent in the third quarter.  Apparently, 
the rebound in oil prices this year has led to an  upturn in oil drilli ng in the past several 
months.  Indeed, the number of drilling rigs  in operation in early December was a good 
bit above the level at the end of the third quarter.

 Business Inventories 
After large liquidations in the first half of the year, real  nonfarm inventories excluding 
motor vehicles are estimated to have fallen ag ain in the third quarter—at an annual rate of 
about $130 billion.  In October, however, th e book value of manufact uring and wholesale 
trade inventories (other than motor vehicles) increased for the first time in more than a 
year, suggesting that some slowing in the pace of real inventory liquidation may be under 
way.  The measure of months’ supply implied by the book-value data for the 
manufacturing and trade sector (which includes retail invent ories and is only available 
through September) remained somewhat elevated, but has fallen significantly since the middle of the year.   
The staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventories outside motor 
vehicles continued to decline through Octobe r, though at a slower pace than in the middle 
of the year.  After falling sharply in the th ree months ending in August, months’ supply 
excluding motor vehicles is estimated to ha ve been little changed in September and 
October.  According to this measure, invent ory-sales ratios remain above trend for most 
market groups; one exception is consumer goods, where inventories in October were 
relatively well aligned with sales.   In contrast, in the November ISM, the num ber of supply managers who described their 
customers’ inventories as too low continued to exceed those who described inventories as 
too high by a very wide margin.  This readi ng suggests that manage rs in manufacturing 
expect their customers to do some restocking in the coming months.

Federal Government Sector 
Total real purchases by the federal government rose at an annual rate  of 8¼ percent in the 
third quarter, led by a strong increase in real defense expenditures.  Based on the Monthly 
Treasury Statement for October and the daily data for November, real defense spending 
appears to have dipped so far in the fourth quarter.  
                                                 
5 The question posed to purchasing managers in the ISM survey to determine whether stocks are too 
high or too low does not specify the measure of sales against which respondents should compare the level 
of their customers’ inventories.  If the respondents currently are judging inventories against a level of expected sales in coming months that is materially above the recent pace of sales, the low level of the 
customers’ inventories measure is less obviously at odds with the inventory ratios in both the book-value 
data and the staff’s flow-of-goods system.

 The unified federal budget deficit continued to widen in October—the first month of 
fiscal 2010.6  Receipts were 18 percent lower in Oct ober than in the same month last year, 
mostly reflecting the ongoing weakness in taxa ble income and the tax cuts in the 2009 
stimulus package.  Meanwhile, outlays declined  3 percent in October relative to the same 
month a year ago, primarily because of a drop in spending on the TARP from $33 billion 
last October to almost zero this year.7  Excluding the TARP payments, federal spending 
increased in October relative to a year earlie r, boosted by both the effects of the weak 
labor market on low-income support programs and the spending from the stimulus 
package.  In all, about $240 billion in stimulus funds (about  30 percent of the total  
$787 billion stimulus package) had been distri buted in the form of spending increases and 
tax cuts by the end of November. 
State and Local Government Sector 
Incoming data point to some firming in real purchases by state and local governments.  
According to the latest labor market repor t, state and local employment rose 6,000 in 
November, and the data for October were re vised up to show an increase of 29,000; the 
increases over the past two months were c oncentrated in the education sector, where 
payrolls had fallen especially sharply betw een May and September.  Meanwhile, after 
smoothing through the volatility in the monthl y numbers, real construction expenditures 
appear to be holding up after ri sing appreciably in the second  and third quarters.  Real 
construction spending continues to be bolstered  by the availability of federal stimulus 
funds, supportive conditions in the munici pal bond market, and the moderation in 
construction costs this year. 
Although the grants provided under the Ameri can Recovery and Reinvestment Act have 
helped cushion the effects of the recession on state and local govern ments, the sector’s 
operating budgets remain under pressure.  Based on information from 44 states, the 
Rockefeller Institute of Government estimates  that nominal state tax collections fell 
nearly 11 percent over the four quarters e nding in the third quart er of this year.8  The 
ongoing weakness in revenues spans all major cate gories of taxes and is  forcing states to 
                                                 
6 While the expanding deficit has pushed up the ratio of federal debt to GDP above 50 percent, debt 
outstanding declined a bit in October because the Treasury reduced the size of its Supplementary Financing 
Program by $185 billion (which does not show up in th e unified deficit figures) in order to create more 
room under the current statutory debt limit. 
7 In the Monthly Treasury Statement, outlays associat ed with the TARP are recorded on a net present 
value basis, taking into account market risk; a pos itive outlay is associated with an expected loss.  
8 The states not included in the tabulation are Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Texas, 
and Wyoming.

 make adjustments to their enacted budgets for fiscal year 2010 (which began on July 1 in 
most states).  Indeed, according to a tabul ation released by the National Conference of 
State Legislatures in mid-November, new budget gaps have emerged in at least 31 states 
since the start of the current fiscal year.  In response, se veral states have implemented 
across-the-board cuts in sp ending to close budget gaps, wh ile others have trimmed 
outlays for specific programs and laid off or furloughed workers.  
Prices 
After slowing considerably ove r the past year, consum
er price inflation has moved up in 
recent months, while core inflation has remained subdued.   Over the 12 months ending 
in October, the headline PCE price inde x increased just ¼ percent, down from a 
3¼ percent increase in the year-earlier period.  The sharp deceleration in  the 12-month 
change partly reflected the plunge in energy prices at the end of 2008 and the decline in 
food prices over the past year.  However, PC E prices have posted considerably larger 
increases in recent months as energy prices have surged.  In contrast, core PCE prices 
have continued to increase moderately of late, abstracting from a jump in the nonmarket 
component of prices in October.  Over the 12 months ending in October, core PCE prices 
increased 1½ percent, well below the increas e of 2¼ percent registered over the year-
earlier 12-month period.  Survey measures of  longer-term inflation expectations have 
been mixed with a small increase in the Reut ers/University of Michigan survey and small 
decreases in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). 
Consumer energy prices climbed 1.6 percent in October after incr easing 0.8 percent in 
September.  The surge in consumer energy pri ces in recent months reflects this year’s 
rebound in the price of crude oil and an unus ually quick pass-through of the run-up in 
spot prices for natural gas that occurred in Oc tober.  Indeed, consumer prices for natural 
gas jumped 1.9 percent in October, boosted by fuel adjustment surcharges in several 
metropolitan areas that had unusually cold October weather.  Ba sed on recent survey 
data, we expect consumer gasoline prices to  move up sharply in November.  In contrast, 
natural gas spot prices moved down significantly in November in response to ample inventories, but they have more than retr aced that decline in early December, likely 
because of a cold snap in several parts of the country. 
Although the sizable declin es in food prices that were ev ident earlier in the year seem 
mostly to have ended, consumer food pri ces remain 1½ percent below their level  
12 months earlier.  This 12-month decrease in consumer food pri ces stands in stark 
contrast to the 7 percent increa se over the year-earlier peri od.  More recently, consumer

 food prices edged up 0.1 percent in October, while spot pric es for grain and livestock 
have risen briskly in recent weeks. 
PCE prices excluding food and energy moved up 0.2 percent in October as prices in the 
volatile nonmarket category jumped 0.8 percent.  Market-based core prices remained 
subdued in October, edging up 0.1 percent for th e sixth consecutive month.  Over the past 
12 months, the deceleration in core PCE pri ces has been relatively widespread.  Apart 
from the tax-induced increases in tobacco pr ices and a rebound in motor vehicles prices, 
prices for core goods decelerated considerably  over the year ending in October.  Core 
services prices also decelerat ed significantly over the past  12 months, reflecting notably 
smaller increases in housing services a nd several other serv ices categories. 
Measures of inflation expectations have been mixed recently.  In the Reuters/University of Michigan survey for November, median year-ahead inflation expectations moved 
down 0.2 percentage point from their October reading to 2.7 percent.  Median inflation 
expectations over the next 5 to 10 years edge d up 0.1 percentage point from their October 
reading to 3.0 percent but remain in the narrow range that  has prevailed over the past few 
years.  In contrast, median long-run infla tion expectations as measured by the SPF moved 
down in the fourth quarter fr om earlier readings, with e xpectations for the CPI moving 
down 0.2 percentage point to 2.3 percent, and expectations for the PCE index edging down 0.1 percentage point to 2.1 percent. 
At earlier stages of processing, the producer  price index (PPI) for core intermediate 
materials declined 0.2 percent in October, br eaking a string of four consecutive months of 
increases.  Despite the recent four-month increase, the PPI fo r core intermediates remains 
well below its elevated level a year ago.  In  contrast, commodity prices stand a good bit 
above their year-earlier le vels.  Since the October Greenbook, both the Commodity 
Research Bureau (CRB) spot index of industrial materials and the Journal of Commerce  
(JOC) index of industrial mate rials have continued to move  up, rising 7.5 percent and  
8.4 percent, respectively.   
Labor Costs 
After a sharp decline in the first quarter, revised data indicate that P&C compensation per 
hour rebounded in the second quart er and continued to rise so lidly in the third quarter.

 Nonetheless, after smoothing through the quarter ly swings, measures of labor costs have 
decelerated modestly over the past year.  P&C compensation per hour is reported to have 
risen 2.5 percent over the four qua rters ending in the third quart er of this year, down from 
a 3.1 percent increase over the four quarters  ending a year earlier.  Labor compensation 
as measured by the ECI decelerated more sharply over the past year, moving up only  
1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in Sept ember after increasing 2.8 percent in the 
year-earlier period. 
Turning to the current quarter, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory 
workers increased 0.3 percent in October and 0.1 percent in Novemb er.  Average hourly 
earnings have also decelerated over the past year.  Over the 12 months ending in 
November, this wage measure increased 2.2 perc ent, 1.7 percentage points less than over 
the preceding year.

 Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Market expectations for the path of th e federal funds rate shifted down over the 
interm
eeting period, and yields on nominal Treas ury coupon securities decreased as well.  
Stock prices moved higher, while yield sp reads on corporate bonds edged down.  In 
short-term funding markets, year-end pressure s have been muted thus far, although strong 
demand for Treasury bills that mature early ne xt year has helped push their yields close 
to zero.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses remained light in recent weeks, as 
C&I loans outstanding contracted further bu t net bond issuance remained fairly strong.  
The first newly issued CMBS since June 2008 came to market over the intermeeting 
period, but conditions in the commercial mortga ge market continued to be tight overall.  
In the household sector, the latest data showed  a further slight contraction of mortgage 
debt and consumer credit and delinquency  rates that have remained very high. 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
Implied rates on federal funds and Eurodol lar futures decreased, on net, over the 
interm
eeting period.  Although the FOMC’s deci sion to keep the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate unchanged at the November meeting and the retention of the “extended 
period” language in the accompanying stat ement were largely anticipated, market 
participants took note of the Co mmittee’s explicit enumeration of  some of the factors that 
are expected to continue to warrant this policy, and Eur odollar futures rates decreased 
slightly on the release.  Investors’ perceptions that the federal f unds rate will likely 
remain near its current level for some time appeared to be reinforced by subsequent 
Federal Reserve communications, most notably Chairman Bernanke’s speech on November 16.  Incoming economic data were , on balance, somewhat better than 
expected, but their net impact on interest rate expectations appeared to be small.  Based 
on the staff’s usual assumption of a term pr emium of 1 basis point per month, futures 
quotes currently indicate that the federal funds  rate is expected to rise above 25 basis 
points for the first time during the third quart er of 2010 and to reach about 1¾ percent by 
the end of 2011.  In the December survey of  primary dealers, around two-thirds of 
respondents reported expecting the first polic y rate increase to o ccur by the end of 2010, 
a slightly larger fraction than  in the October survey.   
Consistent with the decline in the expected path of th e federal funds rate over the 
interm
eeting period yields on nominal Treasur y securities declined 22 basis points and  
12 basis points at the 2- and 10-year maturitie s, respectively.  TIPS yields fell slightly 
more than nominal yields, implying a sma ll net increase in inflation compensation.

 Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets 
Investor sentiment toward the financial sect or has changed little, on balance, since the 
Nove
mber FOMC meeting.  Equity prices at  large and small banks increased a bit less 
than broader market indexes, in part as inve stors continued to expr ess concerns about the 
future profitability of the banking industry; CDS spreads for banking institutions edged 
down.  Market commentary suggested that so me large financial firms and hedge funds 
may have pared their holdings of riskier asse ts ahead of year-end in  order to lock in 
capital market gains posted over the course of  the year.  Their increased demand for safe 
assets reportedly contributed to the scarcity and near-zer o yields of Treasury bills 
maturing just after year-end.   
Conditions in short-term funding markets ch anged little over the interm eeting period.  
One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads rema ined very low, while six-month spreads 
continued to edge down.  Spreads on A2/P2 -rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP 
also remained at the low end of each of th eir ranges since the fall of 2007.  Thus far, 
year-end pressures appear to be much lighter than in the past two years.  The forward 
premiums priced into one- and two-month Libor rates as th ey crossed year-end were only 
20 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively— significantly less than those of last year 
and the year before.  Meanwhile, the term st ructure of commercial paper rates has stayed 
relatively flat through the early part of 2010.   
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Total Federal Reserve holdi ngs of agency debt and MB S under the large-scale asset 
purchase p
rograms reached $156 billion and about $1.1 trillion, respectively, during the 
intermeeting period.  Reports suggest that th e tapering of Federal Reserve purchases of 
agency MBS has, to date, placed only mode st upward pressure on MBS yields.  Some 
market participants reportedly interpreted the relatively low shares of accepted bids in the 
agency debt operations as indicating a wind-down in that program as well.  The 
announcement in the FOMC statement that the Federal Reserve would purchase only 
about $175 billion of agency securities had not been generally anticipated by market 
participants, and spreads on those securities increased a few basis points on the release. 
Usage of the Federal Reserve’s credit fac ilities generally declined further over the 
interm
eeting period.  TAF auctions—includi ng those that provided funding over year-
end—continued to be substantially undersubscribed.  Commercial paper held by the 
CPFF declined to around $9 billion, and TA LF credit edged up slightly to around  
$44 billion.  On November 17, the TALF subscription for CMBS resulted in loans totaling about $1.4 billion, including about $72 million in loans backed by the first newly 
issued CMBS since June 2008.  On December 3, the ABS TALF subscription supported

  six deals, with a total of about $3 billion in lo an requests that will sett le later this week.  
Thus far, there are no indications in in terbank, repurchase agreement (repo), or 
commercial paper markets to suggest that ma rket participants e xpect conditions to 
deteriorate around February 1, 2010, when some facilities  (the AMLF, CPFF, PDCF, 
TSLF, and foreign currency swap lines) are scheduled to expire. 
On November 17, the Board announced a reduct ion in the m aximum maturity of primary 
credit loans at the discount window for depository institutions to 28 days from 90 days, effective January 14, 2010.  In early December,  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
began conducting a series of small-scale, real-value reverse re po transactions with 
primary dealers as a test of the systems need ed to use such transactions as a reserve-
draining tool.  Financial markets were unaffected by these developments. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Over the intermeeting period, broad stock pri ce indexes rose about 5 percent, reflecting, 
in part, stronger-than-expected earnings reports  from 
 a number of firms in the first half  
of November.  The staff’s estimate of the real  return on equity expected over the next  
10 years for S&P 500 firms continued to hover at about its averag e levels during the 
recession of the early 1990s.  As a result, th e gap between the expected return and the 
real 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity risk premium—remained at a level 
that would appear broadly consistent with continued investor uncer tainty about the pace 
of economic recovery.  However, option-imp lied volatility on the S&P 500 index fell, 
and it now stands at roughly its lowe st level since early September 2008.  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate 
bonds decreased a little more than those on com
parable-maturity Treasury securities, 
leaving the risk spreads a touch narrower.  Es timates of bid-asked spreads for investment- 
and speculative-grade corporate bonds—indicators  of liquidity in the secondary corporate 
bond market—remained steady at moderate leve ls.  Conditions in the leveraged loan 
market were also little changed, with both av erage bid prices and bid-asked spreads about 
flat for the period.

 Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
With the latest quarterly earnings season now  almost com plete, earnings per share for 
S&P 500 firms are estimated to have logged another solid gain in the third quarter.  In 
addition, during the month ending in mid-Nove mber, analysts significantly revised up 
their expectations for year-ah ead earnings for S&P 500 firms. 
On balance, indicators of the credit qualit y of nonfinancial firm s improved somewhat in 
recent months.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations fell in 
the third quarter, while liquid asse ts as a share of total assets climbed further.  The pace 
of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrad es by Moody’s remained moderate through 
November, while the pace of upgrades was stro ng, in large part re flecting the upgrade of 
Ford Motor Company last month.  Although th e delinquency rate on C&I loans continued 
to increase in the third quarte r, the six-month trailing bond default rate for all U.S. firms 
inched down further in October and has retrac ed about three-quarter s of the spike that 
occurred in late 2008 and early this year.  Th e year-ahead expected default frequency for 
nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV remained close to 2 percent, less than half its 
level in March. 
Business Finance 
Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corpor ations jum ped in 
November following a lull in October, and speculative-grade bond issuance maintained a 
solid pace.  By contrast, both nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding and C&I loans 
contracted, on net, in November, although the decrease in commercial paper was not widespread across issuers.  Overall, net de bt financing by nonfinancial businesses is 
estimated to have been negligible this quart er after having been negative in the third 
quarter. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms rem
 ained solid in November, 
including a spate of initial public offerings that were generally well received by the 
market.  In the third quarter, overall private and public equity issuance continued to outpace retirements, as both estimated shar e repurchases and retirements from cash-
financed mergers remained muted.  So far in the fourth quarter, announcements of share repurchase programs have continued to be sp arse, but the volume of announced mergers 
and acquisitions has rebounded. 
Public equity issuance by financial firms remained moderate in November.  However, on 
Decem
ber 3, Bank of America completed a larg e secondary equity offering of just over 
$19 billion in common-equivalent shares as part  of the firm’s plan to repay TARP funds; 
this offering was very well received.  Gr oss bond issuance by financial firms slowed

 somewhat further following the October 31 expiration of the FDIC’s Temporary 
Liquidity Guarantee Program. 
Commercial Real Estate Finance  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate rem ained strained.  Outstanding 
commercial mortgage debt is estimated to ha ve decreased at an annual rate of about  
4 percent in the third quarter, and recent data suggest anothe r decline this quarter.  The 
dollar value of commercial re al estate sales stayed very  low in November, and around 
half of transacted properties were sold at  a nominal loss.  Commercial property prices 
decreased about 3 percent in September, le aving the index about 40 percent below its 
peak in mid-2007, at roughly its mid-2003 level.   In October, deli nquency rates on loans 
in CMBS pools increased to 4¾ percent, about  the same as the delinquency rate on CRE 
loans for existing properties held by commercial banks in the third quarter.  Delinquency 
rates on banks’ construction and land devel opment loans for residential and commercial 
projects climbed above levels that were already exceptionally high.  CDS index prices 
covering a range of investment-grade CMBS increased, on net, as investors appear to 
have been encouraged by the first issuance of CMBS since the spring of 2008; moreover, 
reports suggest that two more CMBS d eals will be offered in coming weeks. 
Household Finance  
Over the intermeeting period, th e average interest rate on 30- year conform ing fixed-rate 
mortgages decreased to less than 5 percent, and the spread between this mortgage rate 
and the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed.  Despite the low level of the 
conforming mortgage rate, refinancing activity does not seem to  have picked up in recent 
weeks.  Agency MBS yields decreased, on net, in recent weeks, while issuance of these securities moderated through October.   
Following several monthly increases, the repeat-sales house-price index from
  
LoanPerformance (LP) inched down in Septem ber and October, leaving the index about  
8 percent below its year-earli er level.  Delinquency rates for fixed- and variable-rate 
prime mortgages continued to climb in Oc tober, as did the delinquency rate for  
FHA-backed loans. Consumer credit contracted for the ninth consecutive m
 onth in October, as a sizable 
decline in revolving credit more than offset  a slight increase in nonrevolving credit.  
Consumer ABS issuance increased in November, boosted by an increase in auto-loan 
securitizations.  Credit card ABS issuance, whic h was very low in the past two months, is 
anticipated to pick up substantially in Decem ber as a result of interim guidance clarifying 
how the FDIC would handle these securitizati ons for a sponsoring bank in receivership.

 The latest readings on consumer interest rates have been mixed:  Interest rates offered on 
credit cards increased in October, while rates on new and used auto loans dropped in 
November.  Delinquency rates on consumer lo ans have remained high in recent months, 
although they have not continued to climb. 
Long-term mutual funds received sizable ne t inf lows in November, though not quite as 
large as had been seen during the summer.  Net flows into bond f unds last month again 
more than offset net redemptions from e quity funds.  Money market mutual funds 
continued to experience net outflows in N ovember, as yields paid by these funds 
remained extremely low. 
Treasury Finance 
To date, the Treasury has auctioned about  $240 billion of nom inal coupon securities 
across the term structure duri ng the intermeeting period.  The auctions were very well 
received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly at th e upper end of their recent ranges.  Indirect 
participation continued to trend upward, in dicating resilient foreign demand.  Treasury 
trading volumes remained within their recent ranges, and indicators of liquidity in the 
nominal coupon market—yield curve fitting errors, on-the-run premiums, and fails-to-
deliver in the repo market—were roughly stable.  In the TIPS market, there were 
indications that liquidity improved, on balance, in recent weeks.   
In its quarterly refunding st atem ent, the Treasury announced  the discontinuation of the 
20-year TIPS and the re-introduction of the 30- year TIPS, actions that were broadly in 
line with market expectations.  Separatel y, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee 
recommended that total TIPS issuance for 2010 increase to between $70 billion and  
$80 billion, up from $58 billion in 2009.  This  amount, which would not be sufficient to 
replace the stock of TIPS maturing next year, was significantly below traders’ 
expectations and may have put some downward pressure on TIPS yields over the period.  
Absent legislative action, Treasury debt subject to limit is projected to breach the current 
statutory ceiling in coming weeks.  As in  the past, the Treasury will likely use its 
available accounting tools to continue nor mal funding operations until the Congress 
raises the limit. 
State and Local Government Finance 
Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds rem ained robust in November, mostly 
driven by the strength of new capital issuance.  The pace of short-term issuance was 
again subdued in November, consistent with  typical seasonal patterns.  Newly acquired 
ratings data from Moody’s show  that credit quality in the municipal sector has steadily 
deteriorated over the first three quarters of  2009.  This trend had been obscured in the

 ratings data we obtained from Standard & Poor ’s because of that firm’s gradual increase 
in municipal debt ratings as they moved to align their ratings criteria for corporate and 
municipal debt.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds edge d slightly lower over the 
intermeeting period, leaving their ratios to comparable-maturity Treasury yields little 
changed. 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 increased at an annual rate  of 4½ percent in Nove mber, in line with its rate of growth 
in September and October.  Liquid deposits  continued to expand rapidly, while small 
time deposits and retail money market mutual funds  contracted further, albeit at a slightly 
slower pace than in prior months.  Currency ran off at an annual rate of 5 percent in 
November, as demand from abroad continued to  moderate.  The monetary base expanded 
at an annual rate of almost 50 percent, as purch ases of long-term assets more than offset a 
decrease in the usage of liqui dity and credit facilities. 
Commercial bank credit is estimated to have  fallen further in Nove mber, although the 
rate of decline slowed from that in prev ious months.  Banks’ holdings of securities 
decreased at about a 2 percent pace in November, and their total loans contracted about  
5 percent at an annual rate.  Co re loans (the sum of C&I, real  estate, and consumer loans) 
decreased at an estimated annual rate of 7¼ percent in November, a pace that was about half as rapid as in recent months.  On th e business side, C&I loan s fell at a nearly  
16 percent rate, as paydowns, maturing loans, and loan sales reportedl y contributed to the 
decline.   Commercial real estate loans shra nk at about a 10 percent pace, consistent with 
weak fundamentals in that sector.  On the household side, a slowdown in banks’ sales of 
loans to the GSEs during the intermeeting peri od arrested the cont raction in on-balance-
sheet holdings of closed-end residential mortgages registered in each of the previous seven months; however, home equity loans continued to run off.  Consumer loans declined considerably as credit card loan originations dropped.  Call Report data for the 
third quarter show that unused commitments  to fund loans contracted for the seventh 
consecutive quarter, but that th e rate of decline slowed, particularly for commitments to 
lend to businesses. 
Industry-wide measures of returns on assets  and equity were bolst ered by substantial 
profits at a few large banks that resulted, in
 part, from reduced loan loss provisioning at 
those institutions.  However, delinquency and charge-off rates continued to rise for most 
loan categories, and losses remained wide spread among regional and smaller banks.  In 
the aggregate, regulatory capital ratios in creased further in the third quarter, as 
commercial banks received equity infusions from their parent holding companies and reduced their asset holdings.

 Loan price data from the November Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated that 
C&I loan rate spreads over comparable-maturity market instruments rose noticeably for 
the fifth consecutive survey.  The increase was apparent across most types of loans, 
including small loans and loans at small banks, which may indicate that credit conditions for small and medium-sized firms tightened further.

U.S. International Transactions  
Trade in Goods and Services  
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $36.5 billion in September ,  from 
$30.8 billion in August, as a surge in imports outpaced an increase in  exports.  
 
 
 
The value of exports of goods and services moved up 2.9 percent in September after 
remaining about flat in August.  The Septembe r increase was relatively broad based with 
most major categories of exports moving higher.  Capital goods recorded a particular ly 
robust gain, as aircraft reco vered following a weak August and exports of machinery 
climbed sharply, more than offsetting a slight decline in high-tech goods.  Industrial supplies also grew strongly, supported by higher exports of petroleum products and chemicals.  In contrast, exports of agricultural products fell, largely on account of lower prices.   
In the third quarter, nominal exports jumped a robust 24 percent at an annual rate, but onl
y retraced a small portion of the declines recorded late last y ear and through the first 
half of this year.  The third-quarter increase was most pronounced in industrial supplies, helped by higher prices as well as an increase in volumes.  Exports of automotive products also recorded a large increase following especially steep declines in earlier

 quarters.  Most other major categories of exports also increased with the exception of 
agricultural products, which recorded a small decline.

 The value of imports of goods and services jumped 5.8 percent in September, after 
declining slightly in August.  Imports of oil accounted for roughly one half of the September increase, reflecting both greater volumes and higher prices.  In addition to oil, 
most other categories of imports als o recorded gains in September, with imports of 
automotive products exhibiting a particularly large increase.   
For the third quarter as a whole, nominal imports surged nearly 37 percent at an annual r
ate, but, as with exports, only managed to retrace a small amount of the steep decline 
that occurred over the prev ious three quarters.  The third- quarter increase was broadbased 
across major categories of imports, with automotive products and oil showing particularly large gains.  The increase in oil imports was wholly reflected in higher prices as volumes declined slightly.  
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-o
il imports .  Prices for imported core goods rose 0.6 percent in October, slightly 
less than in September , when they registered their  largest increase since J uly 2008.  The 
increase reflected higher prices for both material -intensive goods, as in previous months, 
and finished goods, whose prices previously had remained rather flat.  Within finished 
goods, prices for all major subcategories showed moderate growt h. 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil has been roughly flat for 
the past two months, falling 1 percent in September and then rising nearly 1 percent in October.  In contrast, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil moved higher during October, rising about 9 percent to an average of $76 per barrel for the month as a whole, and then continued to move higher during November, rising to an average of $78.  In early -December , however, spot WTI retreated , closing most recently 
on December 8 at  $72.62 per barrel. 
Exports.  Core export prices rose 0.3 percent in October, in contrast to a 0.3 percent dec
line the previous month.  October prices were boosted by an increase in the prices of 
materially -intensive exports, as higher prices for industrial supplies more than offset 
lower prices of agricultural products.  Prices for finished goods increased only slightly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions  
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received additional Treasury data on 
international financial transactions in the third quarter and partial data for October.  On balance, private foreigners have continued to sell U.S. Treasury securities and purchase U.S. equities, while foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasuries have remained strong.  
Foreign official inflows dipped in September but resumed quite strongly in October (see line 1 of the table “Summary of U.S. International Transactions”; see also the figure “Foreign Official Financial Inflows through October 2009”).  Off icial purchases of U.S. 
Treasury securities continued at a strong pace in both months,  
. 
Net official financial inflows in October also received a boost from a further $25 billion decline in outstanding drawings by foreign central banks on the Federal Reserve swap lines , reflecting continued normalization of funding markets.  The swap lines are 
recorded as a U.S. claim on foreigners and therefore generate inflows as they are repaid.   
Banks located in the United States borrowed funds from affiliated foreign offices, contributing to large net banking inflows in September (line 3).  These flows could reflect 
a recycling of funds that went abroad through other channels.  In particular, we received additional partial data for the third quarter that show U.S. institutional in vestors 
purchased $130 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated negotiable CDs and short- term debt 
abroad —most issued by foreign financial institutions.  (These data, not shown, will be 
included in line 10 upon the release of the third- quarter balance of payments  accounts.)  
Although dollar interest rates remain higher in Europe than in the United States, the spreads have narrowed during 2009, suggesting that the large third-quarter outflows may reflect improved sentiment toward foreign financial institutions.  
Private foreigners intensified their net sales of Treasuries in October to $45 billion (line 
4a), continuing the reversal of flight- to-safety flows.  Net sales of Treasuries by 
foreigners were concentrated in bills, likely in part reflecting the decline in the stock outstanding.  Private foreign investors continued to show interest in U.S. equities in both September and October (line 4d), with September’s purchases ranking among the highest since early 2008.   
 
 
 
 
 
 

IV-8 
 
 However, private foreign interest in U.S. agency and corporate debt remains weak.  
Private foreigners bought about $7 billion in agency bonds in September but sold $5 billion on net in October (line 4b).  U.S. corporate bonds continue to be sold, on net, by foreigners (line 4c).  
U.S. investors continued their strong net purchases of foreign securities in September and O
ctober, buying primarily foreign bonds (line 5a).  International bond issuance has been 
high in recent months, and the portion of such bonds denominated in U.S. dollars remains elevated, w hich may be attracting U.S. investors.

 Foreign Financial Markets  
Since the October Greenbook, t h e dollar has depreciated , on net, against most major 
currencies, falling about 1 percent on a trade-weighted basis against both the major 
foreign currencies and the currencies of our other important trading partners.  This decline appears to have been driven in part by a continued normalization of risk attitudes.  Much of the dollar’s depreciation occurred early in the period, and the dollar fell broadly after the meeting of the G -20 ministers over the weekend of November 7-8, with market 
participants noting that the meeting’s communiqué failed to mention concern over the dollar’s recent depreciatio n.  Notably, the dollar depreciated 3 percent , on balance, 
against the yen.  Japanese officials have voiced concerns about the yen’s strength, although in real effective terms, the yen has just returned to its level in 2005, a time when the Japanese did not intervene in the foreign exchange market.  The depreciation of the dollar led several emerging economies, including Brazil and Korea, to intervene to stem the appreciation of their currencies, while others are reportedly contemplating tightening 
capital controls. 
Consistent with a normalization in risk attitudes, global mutual fund flows show that 
i
nvestors continue to pull money out of money-market funds in favor of equity and bond 
funds.  Foreign stock markets have generally risen, and foreign sovereig n yields have 
declined on net.  Equity indexes in Europe and Japan rose 2¾ and 1 percent respectively, while stock markets in Brazil and Mexico registered double-digit gains, amid rising commodity prices and a better -than-expected Mexican GDP report.  China’s stock market 
rose nearly 9 percent, in part due to strong trade data.  Yields on German and Japanese sovereign benchmark bonds declined about 10 basis points.  However, U.K. yields rose by 9 basis points on net, in part because yields increased after the Bank of England surprised markets by raising the size of its Asset Purchase Facility by only £25 billion to £200 billion at the beginning of November. 
News that the Dubai government had requested a standstill on debts owed by Dubai 
W
orld’s temporarily roiled financial markets.  Global equity markets and sovereign bond 
yields fell, while the dollar rose roughly 1 percent as investors pulled back from riskier investments.  These movements have largely been reversed as investors became increasingly confident that this was an isolated event that was unlikely to spillover to other markets.  Sentiment was buttressed by the announcement that Dubai World was seeking to restructure only $26 billion of its debt.  U.K. banks appear to have the largest exposure to Dubai World, with reports in the financial press suggesting that their overall exposure is about $5 billion.  The Dubai World event raised concerns that other sovereign 
IV-13 
nations with large outstanding debt levels, such as Greece, Hungary, and Ireland, may 
have trouble refinancing, and CDS spreads rose accordingly.  Although most spreads have since fallen back, the Greek spread has risen further this week after Fitch lowered Greece’s sovereign debt rating.

 Developmen ts in Advanced Foreign Economies  
The advanced foreign economies are gradually emerging from their deep recessions.  
Japan, the euro area, and Canada posted positive real GDP growth in the third quarter.  In the United Kingdom, GDP continued to decline, but domestic demand stabilized and the pace of contraction moderated substantially.  Indicators for the current quarter are consistent with positive growth in all the major foreign economies.  In particular, improvements in PMIs and confidence indicators suggest continued positive momentum.  In addition, incoming data show that trade volumes improved further from their early -
year lows, accompanied by increases in production.   
Headline inflation has generally moved up since the October Greenbook, primarly 
r
eflecting higher commodity prices.  A notable exception is Japan, where 12-month rates 
of both headline and core (excluding food and energy) inflation fell to record lows in October.  All major foreign central banks have kept their policy rates unchanged.  
Recently, the BOJ announced a new lending facility offering three-month funds and the 
BOE increased, though modestly, the size of its asset purchase program.  The ECB, in 
contrast, has announced some unwinding of liquidity support measures. 
IV-20 
 
IV-21 
The Japanese  economy grew 1.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, substantially 
below the 4.8 percent pace reported in the first release.  Although private consumption 
rose at a solid pace, likely supported by government stimulus, private investment continued to fall sharply .  Net exports remained a source of growth, but to a lesser extent 
than in the previous quarter as imports began to rebound. 
 
 
 
Indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued moderate  expansion.  Industrial production rose for the eighth consecutive month in October, but at a considerably slower pace, as autos  and electronics production fell back somewhat after surging earlier.  In 
addition, consumer confidence was nearly unchanged in October, and the Shoko-Chukin business confidence survey posted only modest gains in the fourth quarter; previously, both indexes had grown at a more robust pace.  Although the appreciating yen is raising concerns about the near-term outlook, in October, Japanese r eal exports rose 3.4 percent 
on a monthly basis.  The unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in October, down from a peak of 5.7 percent in July.  However, the more reliable job opening- to-
application ratio suggests a much more limited improvement in labor market conditions.   
IV-22 
 
IV-23 
 
 
 In October, the 12- month inflation rate reached a new all -time low of negative 
2.5 percent.  The decline in prices was not limited to commodities; core inflation 
(excluding all food and energy) also reached a record low.  Incoming data suggest that deflationary pressures m ight have eased a bit in November; in the Tokyo area, headline 
prices rose on a monthly basis for the first time since February 2009.   
The BOJ left its policy rate unchanged and repeated its commitment to maintain the zero -
i
nterest -rate policy for an ext ended period.  On December 1, at an emergency meeting, 
the BOJ announced a new lending program , which in part replaces existing facilities,  to 
provide 10 trillion yen (about $110 billion) worth of funds f or three months at a rate of 
0.1 percent against a wide range of collateral.   Previously, Japan’s central bank had 
unveiled plans to withdraw some unconventional policy measures, beginning with 
commercial paper and corporate debt purchase programs at the end of 2009 .  As for fiscal 
policy, the new Hatoyama government recently announced that it intends to take “policy 
action in view of the strengthening yen and problems surrounding stock prices” and plans 
to spend 7.2 trillion yen (1½ percent of GDP) over 2010 and 2011.  It appears, however, that about one- third  of the resources for the additional package, which calls for 
government guarantees for new lending as well as grants to local governments, will come from reshuffling existing budget priorities.  
Euro -a
rea  real GDP increased 1.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, marking a return 
to positive growth after five quarters of contraction .  The rise reflects positive 
contributions from inventories and net exports; final domestic demand continued to decline, although at a moderating pace.  Private consumption fell almost 1  percent, as the 
effects of government incentives for car purchases waned.  Investment decreased 1.4 percent, the slowest pace of decline in six quarters.  Changes in inventories provided a contribution of 1.4 percentage points to growth.  As world trade rebounded, both exports and imports surged at double-digit rates, and net exports contributed 0.6 percentage point to third-quarter growth.   
Recent indicators suggest  f
 urther improvement in economic conditions in the current 
quarte r.  In November, several measures of economic sentiment reached their  highest 
levels since August 2008, and PMIs rose further, consistently indicating expansion in 
both manufacturing and services.  There are also some signs that household spending might be  bottoming out; r eal retail sales were flat in October after falling in the third 
quarter .  In addition, the unemployment rate, after having risen 2½ percentage points 
since early 2008, held  at 9.8 percent in October. 
IV-24 
 
 
 In November, 12-month inflation ros e to 0.6 percent from negative 0.1 percent in 
October, according to the flash estimate.  Excluding all food and energy, October 
inflation was 1.2 percent.   
The ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent at its December 3 me
eting .  The ECB also announced that the one- year refinancing operation scheduled for 
December 16 will be the last liquidity operation with such a long maturity and that the average refinancing rate will be indexed to the minimum bid rate over the life of the operation.  I n addition, the ECB indicated that its last six -month refinancing operation 
will be conducted on March 31, 2010, and that its main refinancing operations will be at a fixed rate with full allotment at least through April 13.  The ECB has continued to imple ment plans to buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds, and by early December  had 
purchased about €26 billion in such bonds.   
IV-25 
 
IV-26 
 
 
 Euro -area credit conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months.  
Household credit growth turned positive in the second quarter and edged up further in the 
third, although corporate credit growth has continued to fall.  Bank lending surveys show ed less tightening in credit standards  in the third quarter.  The surveys also indicate 
that while  demand for credit from corporations is still contracting, that from households 
has begun to increase.  Tight lending has induced firms to issue new debt in financial markets.  In the first three quarters of 2009, nonfinancial corporations have issued €80 billion worth of debt, making up for much  of the contraction in bank loans.   
Amid rising fiscal deficits, the EC recently announced deadlines for countries to return w
ithin the 3 percent rule required by the Stability and Growth Pact.  Most countries, 
including France and Germany, are expected to reach the reference value in 2013.  
However, in the case of Greece, the Commission has yet to change the original deadline set to 2010, which appears quite unrealistic given the projected budget deficit is about 
12 percent of GDP for 2009.  On December 8, Fitch downgraded Greek debt to BBB+ 
with a negative outlook, citing concerns over the medium-term outlook for public finances.   
In the U
nited Kingdom , GDP growth in the third quarter was revised up ½ percentage 
point to negative 1.2 percent  (s.a.a.r.).  F inal domestic demand stabilized, as small 
declines in private consumption and investment were partly offset by higher government spending.  Net exports made the ir first negative contribution to GDP growth since 2007.  
Imports rose 5.2 percent, while exports increased a more modest 2.0 percent.    
Data received since last Greenbook are consistent with output expanding moderately in t
he fourth quarter.  The volume of retail sales rose 0.4 percent in October, and analysts 
project further increases late in the quarter as households bring forward consumption expenditures ahead of the expiration of the temporary value-added tax cut on December  31.  The manufacturing and services PMIs edged down in November but 
continue to point to a moderate expansion of those sectors.  According to the Labor Force Survey, the total number of unemployed (measured as a three -month centered average) 
declined modestly in July and August.  However, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits continued to rise through October. 
IV-27 
 
 
 
 Price pressure has increased in recent months, although it remains subdued overall.  
Headline inflation  jumped to 1.5 percent in October  on a 12-month basis, in part as 
record declines in fuel prices in September 2008 dropped out of the calculation.  Excluding all food and energy, inflation edged up 0.2 percentage point to 1.8 percent.  Producer input and output prices rose further in October.  Both series now stand close to their pre -recession peaks.  Reading through the monthly volatility, measures of earnings 
growth were well below their recent trends in September.  
At its November meeting, the BOE announced the acquisition of an extra £25 billion in as
sets through the creation of reserves, bringing total purchases to £200 billion.  The 
additional purchases are to be completed by the end of January; the BOE is effectively halving the pace of asset purchases.  As of November 26, the B OE had acquired 
£183.4 billion in assets through the creation of bank reserves, almost the entirety of which were gilts.

 On December 9, the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered the 2009 Pre-Budget Report 
which confirmed the sharp deterioration in U.K. public finances.  The fi scal deficit is 
projected to be about 12 percent of  GDP in the current and next fiscal years (fiscal years 
run from April to March).  As a consequence, public sector debt is expected to jump, from under 40 percent of GDP prior to the recession to peak of a lmost 80  percent in  fiscal 
year 2014-2015.  The Treasury’s economic forecast calls for output to grow a meager 1¼ percent in 2010 on the back of a further small contraction in investment and stagnant consumption.  GDP is then forecast to rise 3½ percent in 2011 and 2012. 
Canadian  G
 DP rose 0.4 percent in the third quarter (s.a.a.r.), following a 3 percent 
contraction in the previous quarter.  Final domestic demand expanded rapidly, moving up 
almost 5  percent, as private consumption increased at the fastest pace since the fourth 
quarter of 2007.  Much of the strength in consumption was in durable goods  purchases , 
particularly motor vehicles and furniture.  Fixed investment increased, rising almost 
9 percent, as o utlays on motor vehicles and industrial machinery surged.  Government 
consumption and investment were strong as well in the third quarter, contributing nearly 
2 percentage points to growth.  Residential investment rose 8.1 percent.  
The strength in domestic demand was almost fully offset by a large negative contribution f
rom net exports, as imports grew at about twice the pace of exports.  Both imports and 
exports were boosted by a surge in automotive trade.  Exports outside of energy and autos remained muted, while import gains were widespread .
 
As yet, we have little data beyond the end of September.  The contour of growth heading 
into the current quarter, however, points to further expansion.  September monthly GDP rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent, suggesting momentum built up toward the end of the third quarter.  Likewise, retail sales and manufacturing orders ended the third quarter with strong performance.  In addition, the Canadian housing market continued to rebound forcefully.  After rising more than 15 percent in the third quarter, housi ng starts were up 
5.4 percent in October, neither number at an annual rate.  
 
IV-30 
 
 
 
 Canadian labor market conditions improved in November.  Total employment rose 
0.5 percent.  A record -setting increase in public employment and a solid gain in private 
employment drove November's gains.  Excluding the public sector, private- sector 
employment rose a solid 0.2 percent.  Tempering the good news, aggregate hours worked declined in November, as part- time employment rose and full-time hours dropped.  The 
unemployment rate fell 0. 1 percentage point to 8.5 percent.  
Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in the year ending in October, the first 12-month i
ncrease since May 2009.  Excluding all food and energy , inflation  was 1.2 percent in 
October, up sharply from 0.7 percent in September.  The 12-month change in average hourly wages fell a full percentage point to 2.3 percent in November. 
At its December 8  
 meeting, the BOC  maintained its policy rate at 0.25 percent and 
reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level 
until at least the end of the second quarter of 2010.

 Economic Situation in Other Countries  
Economic activity in the emerging market economies continued to surprise on the upside in the third quarter despite a moderation in the pace of recovery in emerging Asia.  Mexico’s economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk pace in the third quarter, reflecting in part a large payback from an H1N1 virus-related contraction in the second quarter.  In India, GDP also came in well above expectations in the third quarter, reflecting a 
surprisingly effective fiscal stimulus.  Industrial production and trade data point to a slight dip in October in several Asian economies, suggesting a relatively slow start to  the 
fourth quarter.  In emerging Asia, headline inflation continued to rise (albeit generally from low levels), in several cases led by rising food prices.  Meanwhile, inflation continued to fall in Latin American countries, likely owing in part to recent appreciation of their currencies and still -weak domestic demand.  
In C
hina , economic activity continues to expand robustly, although a few indicators 
dipped in October.  Real retail sales growth, on a 12-month basis, remained around 17 percent in October,  and fixed -asset investment growth stayed above 30 percent.  In 
November, the purchasing managers index was 55, the same level as in October, which was the highest since April of last year.  However, industrial production moved down in October from its Sep tember level, as did trade, with the value of imports falling more 
than exports. 
Chinese authorities have continued to trim economic stimulus at the margin.  In October, 
t
he level of outstanding bank loans expanded at the slowest pace this year, and conce rns 
about overcapacity led authorities to instruct financial institutions to limit lending to six industries, including steel and cement.  Nonetheless, credit growth remains accommodative, and outstanding loans are 34 percent higher than a year earlier.  In November, authorities raised the price of electricity for nonresidential use.  This likely will put upward pressure on the producer price index, which has fallen nearly 6 percent over the past year.  Consumer prices have moved higher recently, led by food and housing, but the consumer price index remains slightly below its year- earlier level.  
IV-33 
 
 
 
 
  In India , GDP surged 15 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, underpinned by 
robust manufacturing activity and an especially sharp rebound in social services, reflecting very accommodative fiscal policy.  The strong growth of domestic demand during the third quarter caused the merchandise trade deficit to widen, as imports grew faster than exports.  Available data point to a slight retrenchment of economic activity in the beginning of the fourth quarter:  The purchasing managers index for manufacturing crept down in October and November, reaching 53, its lowest level since March. 
Consumer price inflation continued to hover above 10 percent on a 12-month basis 
t
hrough October.  Wholesale price inflation pushed further into positive territory after 
several months of deflation during the summer, primarily reflecting rising food prices following one of the driest rainy seasons in decades.

 In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs),1 mos t indicators point to robust, though 
moderating, growth in recent months.  In line with Korea and Singapore, which released 
strong third-quarter GDP reports prior to the last Greenbook, Taiwan’s real GDP expanded at an 8.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter.  Exports, consumption, and investment all contributed to growth, pointing to a broad- based recovery.  Meanwhile, 
Hong Kong’s growth slowed sharply to 1.5 percent in the third quarter, as weak consumption and exports offset a boost from inventory accumulation.  Several monthly indicators show a slight dip in the level of economic activity in the region going into the fourth quarter, particularly in Korea, where industrial production, imports, and the purchasing managers index retreated in October.  Trade balances, which moved sharply up at the onset of the crisis as imports fell even more sharply than exports, have since started to give up these increases.  
Inflation has risen from very low levels across the NIEs.  In Korea and Hong Kong, 
pr
ices have risen a bit more than 2 percent during the past year, while in Singapore and 
Taiwan prices remain below their year -earlier levels.  With inflation still contained, 
central banks have kept policy rates on hold.

 Since the previous Greenbook, we have received third- quarter GDP for the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4) .2  Malaysia and Indonesia led the group, 
growing at 10 and 8 percent, respectively, spurred by government spending and a pickup 
in private domestic demand.  Growth in Thailand came in a bit lower, as the recovery stalled in the first two months of the quarter before picking up sharply in September.  In the Philippines, growth decelerated because of weak domestic demand and flat remittances.  With the exception of the Philippines, trade balances have deteriorated relative to the second quarter as strengthenin g domestic demand caused import growth to 
outpace that of exports. 
Consumer prices continued to accelerate in the region with the exception of Indonesia, 
w
here inflation remained roughly flat because of subdued food prices and the 
strengthening rupiah.  I n Thailand, 12-month inflation turned positive in October for the 
first time this year and increased further in November.  Central banks left policy rates 
unchanged.

In Mexico , real GDP rebounded sharply in the third quarter, with strength in both 
manufacturing and services.  The service sector rebound reflected a strong payback from 
the H1N1 virus-related contraction in the second quarter.  The manufacturing sector benefited from higher auto production following the reopening of Chrysler and GM plants.  Both exports and imports rose in the third quarter, and exports rose further in October.  But consumer demand remained weak going into the fourth quarter despite a modest improvement in the unemployment rate.  Weak domestic demand and an appreciating peso helped lower 12-month headline inflation to 4.5 percent in October. 
 
 
 
In early November, the Mexican congress approved a watered -down version of the 
government’s fiscal reform.  Although the final package includes various tax hikes, a rise in fuel prices, and some spending cuts, it left out a centerpiece of the original proposal: a new general sales tax that would have paved the way for broadening the tax base.  As such, the reform is not generally viewed as a significant step toward addressing structural weaknesses in Mexico’s fiscal framework, although it will help the gove rnment’s 
finances in 2010.  As expected, Fitch downgraded Mexican sovereign debt to BBB following the bill’s passage.  However, the fact that Fitch gave Mexico a stable outlook was regarded as positive news that led to a rally in the peso and stock markets.  President 
IV-43 
 
 
 Calderón has nominated Agustín Carstens as the new Governor of the Bank of Mexico 
and Ernesto Cordero as the new Minister of Finance. 
In Brazil , m onthly indicators suggest that robust economic growth in the third quarter has 
extended into the fourth quarter.  (Third- quarter GDP will not be released until December 
10.)  Industrial production continued to climb rapidly through October to a level that was only 5 percent below its September 2008 peak.  The purchasing managers index for manufacturi ng shot up to 55 in November, its highest level in two years.  The recovery 
has been supported by rapid growth of government- directed credit and strong domestic 
demand, particularly for autos and appliances, which have benefited particularly from government tax breaks.  Export growth has been comparatively tepid, causing the trade surplus to narrow since the second quarter. 
Despite the rapid pace of recovery, inflation has continued to creep down.  Headline 
in
flation fe ll to 4.2 percent in October on a 12-month basis, just below the midpoint of 
the central bank’s target range.  The real ’s s trong appreciation this year has likely played 
some part in the fall in inflation.  However, given the weak export recovery, the 
government moved again to limit upward pressure on the currency by closing a loophole that allowed foreign investors to circumvent the 2 percent tax on portfolio capital inflows imposed in late October.  Brazilian companies’ issuance of American Depository Receipts, which foreign investors had been using to gain exposure to the Brazilian stock market without paying the tax, is now subject to a 1.5 percent tax.

                     In Russia , real GDP expanded at a 10.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter following 
three quarters of decline.  The rebound reflected rapid growth of the manufacturing and transport sectors on the production side, and strong investment growth and inventory accumulation on the expenditure side.  Retail sales were flat in the third quarter but posted two consecutive months of growth in September and October, while the unemployment rate crept below 8 percent in October.  Consumer prices were flat in October, bringing headline consumer price inflation down to 9.7 percent on a 12-month basis, the lowest level in two years.  The central  bank of Russia lowered its refinancing 
rate 50 basis points in late November to stem capital inflows and slow the appreciation of the ruble, which has also been supported by higher oil prices.
